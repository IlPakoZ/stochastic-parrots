The purpose of this general is to encourage people to go /out/ and find cool fossils and artifacts. This thread is also a place to share our own collections and things we find when we are /out/ hunting.

Rules are as follows,
>To just post and discuss fossils and other related geological subjects.
>When you post about a fossil in your collection, please label it with what formation it is from, what it is, and where in the world it is from.
>If you don't know where it originated or the species that is ok, just label it as so

Let's say 
>i was walking in desert.
>old area where deep erosion happened 
>walk in cut about six feet deep and 4 foot wide.
>see sticks poking out of side.
>look closer and recognize its ribs, huge ribs.
>look at ground and realize the trail cuts through a huge bone like a thigh bone thick as a plastic five gallon bucket.
>bone is trampled in half but I managed to lift one end and carry back out.
What now if this had happened?

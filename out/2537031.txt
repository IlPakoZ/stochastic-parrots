i got these 23 cams for 500 from the same guy too.

--- 2537352

Link cams are heavy, single axle, and rigid stem so you wouldn't want a full rack of them. 

They really shine for building gear anchors because they fit anywhere. Most folks I know who have one will bring up either a single red or orange on multi pitch

--- 2537954
Hopped on the Nightcrawler (5.10+ 5p T) yesterday. This route is SICK! Almost sent it all clean until the real crux on p3 on a mantle ledge and then whipped like 4 times on the p4 laybacks. Hands and fingers were all churned up and bloody. It was a fuckin hoot. Getting more fun to try hard and send or whip; definitely growing as a climber. Maybe a year ago I’d still be a bit spooked to fall on gear. Now we’re rockin and rollin.

I’d say it’s really up in the air. I’d take 5.10c/d or even a soft 11a. Probably easiest to just call it “5.10+” but the best way for you to know is to go climb it :)
--- 2538326
>>2538290
I’d like to go mountaineering, I guess the closest I’ve come is bear creek spire (5.3 alpine romp). I’m sure the bigger game is more mountaineering and technical climbing together. You’re at least out on a mountain!

The velcro strap is kind of annoying because you have to bend the rubber up and on cold days it doesn't want to cooperate. Otherwise, really solid glove stays in place, and just feels bomber. It does make your hand bigger so some jams you might not be able to get as deep as you would gloveless , and sometimes getting chalk is a hassle. 4/5

Had kind of a crappy day testing out a new solo toprope setup, which is buggy, my pants were kind of thin and kept getting grabbed by the micro traxion(luckily it was the backup so I could unweight it easily). I did find a consolation prize of two well used cams so that was nice, who the hell leaves their anchors behind?

>>2539659
Thanks for the feedback, I have thin, bony hands and tape doesn't always cut it.
--- 2540124
>>2540107
>new solo toprope setup
What was the setup? pic related is what i do usually
--- 2540162
>>2540124
First I'm trying a single strand of rope, for the simplicity, then I'm using a roll-n-lock on the chest harness(up high like you have it) and the microtrax hanging from the waist on a short extension The greater distance between the devices makes it easier to ascend/descend with an aider but it also interferes with my legs so I'll have to keep it close like you have that black device, btw what is that? Also there were problems with the chest harness, one of which you have solved by having it straddle the micro trax like that. I'm also curious how you are wearing it, mine is awkward and yours probably is better.
--- 2540191
>>2540162
The lower device is just a grigri as backup and so I don't have to change devices to lower myself. The chest harness is a 120cm sling with a twist in it for each arm and then overhand knots on sides to take up slack and keep the microtrax upright.
--- 2540389
>>2540191
Yes I remember now from a previous post you made. I need to get a gri gri and that's a big advantage of two ropes although it looks like it adds some drag to the system. Next time out I'm going to try a single rope but with a TAZ Lov device up high which has very little drag so I can lower quickly without having to unweight anything or add something else. 
Have you tried solo lead yet? That's something I'm eager to do.
--- 2540662
>>2540389
The grigri does add some drag, but it doesn't drag me like getting short roped would, it just doesn't feed through the device on it's own. If the route was longer I'd go single strand Y hang but it's pretty short so I just do a super 8 anchor. I'd love to try a TAZ Lov but it's pretty spendy for me to justify purchasing. I haven't tried lead solo yet but it's definitely on my radar, I got "Me, Myself &amp; I: The dark arts of big wall soloing by Andy Kirkpatrick" to read and also a nice pdf I'm trying to link but 4chan thinks its spam
--- 2541096
>>2540662
Thanks for the tip on the book. I did the first test of single rope and TAZ Lov rig today on a vertical face.
My foot slipped while getting into a lieback over a small roof, totally unexpected and a free fall, it worked great and it was easy to just lower down and start again. There are some issues with it that you need to be aware of and compensate for before using it, having to do with lowering and also triggering the mechanism quickly, but overall I'm happy with it. Have fun out there.

Devils Tower is one of the best crack climbing spots in the world. Climbed the Durrance Route back in 2020, shit was the tits but it gets crowded. We started before sunrise, got to watch the rising sun burn the mist off the plains around the Belle Fourche River. Sounds of the cows mooing wafting up the tower. On the way down we rapped past a guided party, two sixty year old boomers with their 20s guide. "COME ON LARRY JUST PUT YOUR FOOT UP A FOOT COME ON COME ON" with close to forty people waiting for Larry to get to the ledge so they could pass them. Glad we got there early

NTA but the fact that you've never seen an anchor left behind makes me think you don't climb at all.
--- 2544061

Yes, I learned outside then climbed at gyms, you can climb outside whenever you want. If you are bouldering I'd get a crash pad, usually someone has one they don't use and want to get rid off on offerup or FB market.
--- 2546940
>>2545946
Just climb. If your fingies hurt, use the rice bucket.

Training for climbing defeats the purpose for me it's supposed to be fun. I lead 5.10 sport outside v3 boulders 5.6 trad and that's good enough for me. 

Recognize your physical limitations - the average person can climb 5.12/v7 if they train, but that's about it. If you're not genetically gifted to climb, don't bang your head against a wall. Climbing is just a farce anyway.

You probably haven't reached your physical limit on climbing but seems like you've mentally stopped yourself. Of course there will always be a hard climb available, don't you see the thrill in that, that's what we train for. If you climb at a popular crag you will also note that there usually isn't a line for the 5.13

Excellent life choice anon, canyoning is rad.
Where do you live? Do you want to get into Swiftwater wet canyons or dry slotty canyons? Based on you calling it 'canyoneering' I'm guessing southwest USA so dry canyons. This will determine the type of techniques and gear you need to acquire and learn, there is some crossover but also some differences.
>Dynamic rope
No
>Fig8 rapping
Yes
>Carabiners
Yes
>Webbing
Yes
Honestly anon your best move is to find a professional guide/instructor or a group of experienced competent canyoners who would be willing for you to tag along and learn from them. To not be a liability/passenger in a canyon skills/experience you will need: anchor finding and building, both natural (trees, boulders, cracks etc) and bolts (often sketchy), rope management and rappel rigging for both raising and lowering a stuck rappeller, single and double rope ascent techniques, rappelling on often very slippery surfaces, sometimes directly in the flow of powerful waterfalls, whitewater swimming techniques, jumping + sliding in to water from 5m+ heights, climbing to reach anchors with minimal protection and lots of exposure, downclimbing with consequential falls, off track navigation. It's very much a team sport so learning by yourself will be tricky and limiting.
All that said though, the combination of all of those skills/requirements means it's a rad sport and extremely fun.
I rappelled this 75m waterfall recently. The fall line goes right though the main flow. It was super intense and awesome.

I'm in Tucson, AZ. Tho I'm moving to Phoenix in a few months when I graduate.

Is dynamic really that bad? I've been told and understand that static is better if you're primarily rapping though everything I find online says dynamic is fine. What should I do with this rope if not? It's brand new never been used Sterling 9.8mm. Admittedly, my dad brought all this shit out last year for a camping trip to Southern Utah as a "just in case" and just left it all with me. But I'm not gonna complain too much about free rope, could I find a local place to possibly trade it for some shit/static I need?

Not really looking for a whole lot of swimming yet, though I'm fine with wading as long as I can mostly touch the bottom. We hiked Golden Cathedral last year and my bucket list is to do Neon Canyon for the final rappel through the roof

We've got a climbing gym here in town and I want to ask them for direction for finding canyoneering people, but I feel like they're just gonna sell me a membership and then never point me in the right direction/introduce me to people. Literally the only experience I have is rapping on rescue 8s when I got a crash course in it as a firefighter over a decade ago, but I've seen enough YouTube videos to confidently kill myself.

I'll probably pay the $250 for the half day guided trip just so I can meet someone who also does it
--- 2549360
>>2549326
Cool. You can rap on a dynamic rope but all the bouncing when rapping sucks and if you're in a soft rock canyon it will rapidly cut grooves into the rock and will also wear though the sheath which then ruins the rope. Pulling down a dynamic rope from a big pitch also sucks especially if it's a hard pull down or there are lots of potential snags. All your effort just goes to stretching the rope instead of actually getting it down.

Check out www.canyoncollective.com they have a decent forum on there with mostly SW USA based canyoneers. There are lots of grumpy old men but they know their shit and you may find someone willing to let you tag along on a trip. You'll need a harness, double cowstail lanyard, several carabiners and rappel device, helmet, sturdy backpack as a minimum to join a group on a trip. There are bound to be Facebook canyoneer groups too which you can probably find a group willing to let you join a trip.

Wouldn't be a bad start as far as gear goes, maybe see if a local climbing club has a canyon course. Climbing gyms also have bulletin boards you can check out and FB as well. Static ropes are like a third the price of dynamic ropes, the one you have sounds really good tho I'd hold onto it and try to get into climbing as well, a lot of the same skills overlap between the two

Canyon rigging for a Tyrolean may different to climbing because we always have to be able to retrieve from the bottom. Basically though - first person raps normally and finds bottom anchor point. Seconder then block the rope at halfway against the anchor ring at the top of the pitch with a clove hitched biner or similar. Bottom rigger then tensions up with a figure 8 in self locking mode and a 3:1 on the tail with ascender/tibloc as rope grab. Then seconder + others can slide down the taut line on a biner or pulley with the loose side of the rope running through their belay device to control speed. Once everyone is down the pitch, release tension on the locked figure 8 and remove from rope. Then pull down the other loose rope end which was blocked against th anchor. You should have all your gear at the base of the pitch ready to move to the next. Hopefully that made sense I don't have any detailed pics or vids of rigging one up

>Bottom rigger then tensions up with a figure 8 in self locking mode and a 3:1 on the tail with ascender/tibloc as rope grab
It all makes sense I just set up a little mock up in my room except what is the rope grab attached to that's on the tail. 

I'd like to do it to get from one side to another at the same height. In climbing there would probably be bolts and rings I could thread the rope through so I wouldn't need a biner block, but I would need to have one side anchored in and then figure out how to tension the rope.

I need to buy gear for outdoor climbing, tired of having to bum off of friends. What rope to buy? I want to do mostly single pitch, but also some multi pitch and mountaineering with glacier crossings. Can one rope do it all, or do I have to drop half a salary on 3 different ropes? I was hoping I could buy something like a 9.5mm 70m single rope and call it a day. Thoughts?

There's so little interest in the rock itself from rockclimbers.
There's still no good reason explaining the reason for the different features on different rock types, or within the same rocktype (e.g. why's sandstone in tennessee so different from the one in font?), etc.
Sure, I don't expect pros to be interested in anything other than pulling hard (and solar panels) but with the amount of nerds into the sport, I'd think we'd have a fair amount of resources on the subject.

Fuck yeah

Georgia Southern Cross in Atl and another out of Lincoln, Nebraska called Capital Tower.

Fucking love to paint them ...... big mitten in one hand, Petzl Stop in the other on the handle brake....3 gal on my hip.....

Nothing beats that job in the world....Builds are fun and simple....antenna mounts are a bitch to lift to the apex of a Self-Supported Tower, but rigging coax is certainly a beastly gig.

You know this is the best employment ever for a climber....beats any ground work around.

My first test climb was over 1000' on the top of the steel of the Nations Bank building in Atl.....the biggest building in the Southeast.

Got to hit the ladder up to the gold flake covered lightning rod pillar on top....fucking amazing job but they get some pretty awnry guys on the gigs sometimes....

Those companies I worked for before the regulations got too stiff and climbing harnesses were thrown out for the shitty cant-self-rescue-full body harnesses that leave you dangling like an idiot if you lose your footing....

One slip and they have to call in a rescue team....we all agreed to throw them out for Petzl Navajos and Black Diamond Bod harnesses.

There were a ton of climbers with us but also road dogs that were just fearless and after high paying work...can't blame them.

Watching 250 lb guys try to ladder all day was kinda funny as I was in at 180 max.

>>2559384
>is it necessary to use the Micro Traxion, or will any simple pulley do? if i understood correctly the purpose is to manage rope slack only

It's purpose is to capture your progress as you climb. Its a one way entrance for the rope so if you were to fall it'd be the same as falling on TR. You wouldn't want to use a simple pulley because it won't stop the rope from flying through the device. I like the micro traxion because it's familiar but any progress capture pulley/ascender would work. I've heard good stuff about the Roll n Lock from CT and the Taz LOV2

next piece of gear i want to buy is thin rope (don't know the name in english), the kind you use to make prusiks or machards. my understanding is that it's supposed to be thin but not very much, at least 6mm, is this correct?

should this kind of rope be static, or dynamic? i hear that people also use it in mountaneering, but i it only for rappel? if so it should be static, right? any info about all of this in general would be helpful
--- 2566280
>>2566255
Here it's called cordelette or accessory cord
For friction hitches it should be ~3mm smaller diameter than the climbing rope
7mm is most common and can also be used for anchors or whatever you want really
Usually sold by the foot or 30ft lengths in the US, not sure how you guys do it in metric lol
--- 2566281
>>2566255
Some 6mm cord should do you just fine for this purpose, I use this one and it’s fine for anchors, PAS and prussik
--- 2567242
Making some heavy moves towards going outdoors with my climbs, primarily top rope on natural and bolt anchors. I'll be out at Joshua Tree in a few weeks so looking to shore up gaps in knowledge before then. 

I have a question about setting up a quad on bolts for TR. Is a single bowline + runner + stopper knot sufficient to safely approach the bolts and continue with set-up? I've anchored into the single bowline when the second anchor point wasn't in within a safe distance and to the double bowline when they were safely away from the cliff (both for setting up natural anchors) but I imagine the bolts could vary in accessibility. Should I play it safe and just do two anchor points and hook into the double bowline just for safety? If it's not clear, this is all in reference to safely approaching bolts to set up a quad for TR.

J Tree is gonna be hot as FUCK and I have no idea what you are talking about. Just do pic related if you’re gonna do a quad. For TR set ups I would just make a normal overhand as your master point, throw a locker or 2 in and go. Can you maybe use English or draw me a picture? I can help you further if I understand just what the fuck you’re saying.

Also: http://multipitchclimbing.com/
--- 2567366
>>2567242
I haven't been but j tree is a bad place to do what you described, as there aren't many natural features on the top outs
Here's a pic of where they recommend beginners go, and idk what you would tie off to unless you build an anchor with cams
Maybe crawl on your stomach or pay someone a couple bucks to set it up for you
--- 2567367
>>2567269
You should get a new one soon. I was in the same place about 6 months back and the belay loop gave out almost entirely when I took a fall on autobelay. If it’s been three years you’ve probably gotten your money’s worth easy
--- 2567368
>>2567356

Alright, let me put it more simply. I've never set up a quad before for TR, only natural anchors. You can tether into your anchors as you set up so you can safely approach the edge and send down your rope. where do you tether for setting up a quad? Where are those bolts typically located? Over the edge? Right at the top? How do I safely approach? 

also is pic related fine for a quad?
--- 2567383
>>2567368
Most people scoot or crawl to the bolts with no tether 
They are usually in a relatively safe spot if they were bolted with top roping in mind which you will have to research and find out which ones are beforehand
You pic is fine and you should connect the ends with a double fisherman's knot
--- 2567420
>>2567368
Just slap your PAS into the bolt hanger and put your anchor on the bolt. Connect the bolts. Connect a sling to you and then to the anchor. Move the PAS (if you want). Continue setting up the anchor.
--- 2567432
>>2567368
Sometimes the bolts aren't set up for TR and in that case you'll have to either down climb with a belay, be lowered, or rap to the bolts. If this is the case you'll most likely find rings or quick links on the bolts; try like hell not to TR on these. Use leaver biners instead of a quad if you think it'll be a major hassle to get to the anchor, i.e., nobody in your party can do the climb and you don't have the time to climb around to the top and repeat the down climb/lowering/rap process. Or just use a shit ton of webbing or another rope to extend a natural anchor over the edge.
--- 2567440
>>2567368
>also is pic related fine for a quad?
it is but it's also cumbersome, a 240cm sling like >>2567356 is easier to deploy
--- 2567462
>>2567368
just rap off a natural anchor (tree, BIG rock) to the real anchor, clip your PAS to the anchor, then proceed to build your quad/whatever and put your rope trough it.

>about media appeal more than wanting to climb.
They probably climb more than you. Besides, can you blame them? They have responsibilities to sponsors regarding the media appeal. Its the age we live in. Its the only way for them to do this full time. Not even the competitions pay as well as.they used to 10-15 years ago.
>>2567657
Replicas have been a thing for decades. What? Its a crime to train now? Every craft or elite activity involves practice. Regardless of the sport, deconstructing things to make it easier, simpler and efficient improves performance. You make no sense.
--- 2568543
>>2568160
try talking about a boulder when you see someone doing it, or when you are doing one and you see somebody looking at you doing it. like "dayum that starting position is weird as fuck" or "hey do you think you are supposed to skip that hold over there" or whatever that makes sense. then you try to keep a conversation going.

if you have problems talking with people in general, it will also be difficult meeting climbing friends at the gym, and the other way around

wanna get into multipitch climbing, dont want to gearfag but can someone check if im missing anything for my list to buy for extended rappel for it?
2x 120cm sling, one for the extended rappel and one as anchor or foot sling if i need to ascend
1x atc guide
1x hms carabiner (already have another one)
4x smaller screw lock carabiners
1x 50cm rope for prussik as third hand, will probably just get a pre-sewn one
friend will be buying the same stuff, anything else i should get for backup like a 2nd prussik rope or extra sling also?
--- 2570292

I’d probably just throw in an extra sling and 2 carabiners and you’d be totally set
--- 2570364
>>2570250
Dude. You're gearfagging and you'll load yourself down with unnecessary weight. You have a rack, right? And on that rack you have a belay/rappel device and a locker, right? And you've practiced rappelling and ascending a rope with prussik loops or slings or your shoelaces or whatever, right? Because if you've practiced that shit, which you should've by now if you're thinking about multi pitch routes, you already have a couple slings or prussik loops and maybe a couple lockers which is everything you need. Oh wait, you don't even own a belay/rappel device? Ok, gotcha. Find some rock, learn how to build anchors, do some toproping off those anchors, and by that time you'll have everything you need to rappel. Then practice rappelling and prussiking.
--- 2570499
>>2570292
thanks i think i will get an extra prusik rope too for backup but from accessory cord so its cheaper, will get the backup carabiner and sling though, do you think its worth getting a 240cm sling for an anchor like in >>2567356 also? 
>>2570364
>You're gearfagging
sorry >.&lt;
i only have single pitch sports climbing gear thats why im buying these things, i currently belay with a single rope passive belay device (singing rock rama) but i can belay with an atc i just dont have one lol
theres a really good spot in my area to practice rappelling on so i will practice it there, just wanted to double check if i was missing anything
--- 2570672
>>2570499
>do you think its worth getting a 240cm sling
nta, but if it's a bolted multipitch then yes because you can tie it before even climbing and have it ready to go at every station. I like a 180cm sling for the same thing and it doesn't hang down as low.
--- 2570850
>>2570250
I got bored and laid out your proposed rap rack. I also included a locker for the ATC and my proposed extra sling and 2 biners. You will also be using a locker for the prussik when it is in use, but it can be stored on its own locker or with the ATC. In all, I think you have too much gear for rappelling, but that’s a bonus and with more experience you will be able to pare your rack down a bit.

To count:
> 8 lockers
> 2 120cm slings

You could probably get away with less lockers, honestly. I hope this helps, and let me know if you make any adjustments and I’ll try to lay it out for you.

Based thanks, i think i only need minimum 6 lockers right? i can use the carabiners on my quickdraws in an emergency so maybe the extra ones are not necessary anyways, but i think i will bring them at first.
is using another locker to hold the others only to save space on the harness?
also dyneema slings seem to be just slightly more expensive than nylon so is there any reason to not get them? also im not sure how much use i would get out of the 60cm sling compared to another 120cm though

The lockers clipped to the one locker is just so it doesn’t look so cluttered. But yes, you can clip lockers together to save space. A racked climbing harness is very dynamic in how it is set up, with constant shuffling and moving, so one load out may not always be the same the whole climb. This isn’t a video game, this is real life. I just use dyneema because that’s what my shop sells. Nylon is fine too, but a little bulkier. Use whatever you get, it all works if it’s rated. I hawk it all the time, but https://multipitchclimbing.com is an absolute gem of a website. Do some reading! Get whatever sizes of slings you want, I get a lot of use out of shoulder-length (60cm?) slings. I usually keep a 240cm, a 120cm and a ton of 60cm on my rack for trad days. You can always tie stuff together. Pic related is a 2pc anchor I made on the first pitch of Olive Oil from a nut and #1 cam I reslung with accessory cord. Girth hitch master point and 60cm sling w/ carabiners. Bomb proof (well, a third piece would make it a bit more textbook).

Any 'normal' multipitch maneuver (even anchor transfer on weighted rope) is achievable with max 4 lockers and 3-4 carabiners. 
Since you're a beginner, carry a spare locker just in case, but 6+ is waay too much.

60cm Dyneema is great for making quickdraws, it's also lighter and more easily manipulable compared to nylon. Just be aware that due to the lower melting point, you shouldn't be making any knots that'll get shock loaded with it. 

As for long slings, my go-to is 120cm kevlar for anchor/rap and 180cm nylon for extended anchors/pulleys. 

Also, I recommend carrying ~5m of 6mm rope for abseil anchors, prussiking up the rope, etc.

Had some cool run ins with animals lately and now I want to spend some overnighters or half-nighters in the forest preferably in one or two spots per night for wildlife photography but no idea where to start.

How do I find the best spots?
What camera gear do I need (to get started)?
What out gear do you recommend?

the most expensive trail-cam, tent, and camping gear you can put on your visa platinumâ„¢ card, with a low low introductory rate of 12.99 APR (after 12 months a generous 35% and low annual fee of $500, on your good credit)
be sure to check out REI for the best deals

More knowledgeable anons (who you tell where you are) will answer the other things but
>What camera gear do I need (to get started)?
I would recommend to a beginner:
* Pre owned Canon crop DSLR body. Maybe a 60D or similar. See what fits your budget near you.
* Tamron 70-300mm telephoto lens. You will want extra reach in the daylight and can get some birds with this
* Canon 50mm 1.8 prime lens. Very cheap, decent in lowish light, good depth of field.
* Cheap rain cover for SLR
* Cross-body strap for SLR
* UV filters for lenses - these are essentially just a safety cover for the front element
* Get decent cards. Sandisk Extreme Pro, in 32GB, will do fine.
* Suitable bag. There's a million different opinions on whether you want big/small and messenger/backpack or what have you. Just don't overspend. Amazon Basics is fine.
* For prolonged stands, a tripod is useful, but you might get more utility from a monopod and a bit of prep to stabilise. Much lighter.

Not asking out of spite or anything, but what's the point of wildlife photography?
Do you do it for yourself? Do you look at the pictures afterwards, and every couple of years after that?
Do you post them on the internet, where people rate them or something?
Not meaning to be an asshole or anything. Just curious.
I mean, I like animals too, but I wouldn't know why I'd photograph them, and keep pictures ot them.

Not OP but...
It's a skill to polish. Taking good photos of animals is hard, and tests many qualities. The photos themselves can be a nice memento (and prints are a cheap gift that's usually well received) but I'm more interested in whether I can perform in the conditions of a trip. 
Plus I can use all the same gear to surveil people skinny dipping in the lake.

I am in boreal forest, eastern europe. 
Looks quiet expensive, upwards of 1k?!

Its just my reason for staying out and up all night, so I have something to do in the woods. I don't have a hunting license, otherwise that would be my excuse.

And I don't just photograph animals. I also stalk and clip hobos, bums and other weirdos in the woods. The pics make nice memories. Last autumn I clipped a naked old man in a trench coat pushing his bike. He was up to something weird, hypersexual disorder or something. Eventually I took my 1000 lumen flashlight on him and scared him away.

I know nothing about photography but this anon does >>2572720.
However, I can help with finding the best spots. 

Look for animal tracks in the mud or sand near water. Ungulates, felines, canines, and bears drink water from rivers, lakes, ponds, etc., and have favorite places to drink water. Streams can also provide an easy route for many different animals to travel, and some animals like raccoon and beaver normally won't stray far from water. Elk like to wallow in mud to stay cool in the late summer. Ringtails are usually found near water. So look for water sources and you'll find nocturnal animals. 

Look for game trails on ridges, saddles, below cliffs, between a water source and a food source (like an alfalfa field), at the edges of meadows and fields, and through brushy or heavily wooded areas. Animals will take the easiest way possible to move from a food source to a water source to a bedding area or den. Some animals, like cougars and wolverines, travel large circuitous routes within their territory and you can expect to see the same animal every few days at a spot on that route. Other animals migrate with the seasons and you'll have to locate fresh tracks or scat to find the route. 

Once you find a place that has lots of fresh sign, immediately back out of the area, retracing your steps for a few hundred yards. Don't go back to the place where you turned around for a few days. The idea is to disturb the area as little as possible and prevent the animal from changing its routine. At this point, you should make camp somewhere a few hundred yards from the animal sign (tracks, game trail, scat, etc.). Now your mission is to let the animals get used to your presence at a distance, so if you camp quietly for a couple of weeks and don't move closer the animals will accept your scent and not freak out.

After camping at your spot for a couple of weeks, you can move your camp closer by half. It's likely the animals will alter their routine temporarily but since they are familiar with your scent they won't freak out too much. Again, camp at this new spot for at least a week, longer if you can. The animals will eventually accept you as part of the environment. From your new spot, you can slowly and quietly walk closer every couple of days. Don't get too close; maintain about 25 yards distance from the drinking hole, game trail, etc. Linger for a few minutes and return to camp. 

Once you do this for at least a week, move camp closer by half, but not closer than 30 yards away from the animal spot. This is as close as you'll want to get with camp. From here you can set up for shots if you have an unobstructed view; if you don't you'll need to quietly walk to a place in which you can get a shot. This might even require judicial pruning of vegetation. If you've spent the required time to get here you'll see even the wariest animals. I've spent two months in one spot before animals accepted my presence. If you can't do the whole camping thing, at least spend as much time as you can slowly moving closer. The benefit of camping is that animals will frequently show themselves while you're in camp reading a book. I've had deer, moose, coyotes, bobcats, otters, bears, and other animals walk right up to camp, and in one case a black bear walked right in front of me as I was reading. It actually had to walk around my legs, and I could've easily touched it with my foot. Another time, a skunk would come around every evening and just hang out, even though I never feed wild animals.

Welcome to photography. That being said, get it piecemeal. Just the body, a card and the 50mm should be enough for urban fun and getting used to the camera.
--- 2572888
Reminder that DSLR bodies all have removable batteries so you can absolutely got something quite old and it'll be perfectly fine. Gearfags will claim this isn't true but we took perfectly good pictures on the cameras we had ten years ago.

Photofag from reply 2 here: this is completely correct. While there are some reasons to get newer gear (shutter life if nothing else) a beginner should absolutely be buying pre-owned gear at significant discount and 10 years is a reasonable age for a camera body if it's not shot out completely. Lenses can be as old as your grandpa as long as they're in good condition, though autofocus is probably essential for starting out.

thanks, I will come up with a plan and have a look around for game trails, bedding, and feeding spots.

You set it up like you would a hunt, but you just shoot with a camera instead of a rifle.

Consider blinds, bushcraft or artificial, as well as bait. If you want to shoot deer, then just some normal deercorn is fine. You can even use trailcams to track game.

If you are just birdwatching and photographing birds, you may not need to do this. Maybe bird seed, but you can do birdwatching and wildlife photography without a blind or bait.

I recently just got into photography. My whole life I've never really taken pictures of things, or even cared about them. Some years ago I bought a Canon rebel t6i and never used it. I recently got into it after sustaining an injury and needing something relaxing to do. It's pretty fun. It reminds me a lot of shooting / fishing/ hunting. I upload them for my friends and family on a non social media site. it's just fun if you like it and like the other anon said it is definitely a skill to be honed

What lens do you use, friend? Hope your injury was not too severe and the other guy came off worse.

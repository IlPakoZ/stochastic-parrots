Redpill me on Mt Fuji. Is going there to climb it worth it? If not, why? I heard it's been turned into a tourist attraction devoid of any s/out/l, and I'm second-guessing my enthusiasm to climb it in the foreseeable future. It didn't occur to me that it'd be the case, which in hindsight is quite retarded on my part. Any good alternatives?

Its a gravel path to the top. Just a volcano. Many people. You can do it in one day if you want. Don't expect a nature experience.

You can traverse the Chuo Alps - google 中央アルプス . Hammock or tent both work well. There is considerably less traffic in late autumn (November - December)
You can't do it if you don't have experience.

Northern Honshu is nice too but a lot of infrastructure still. 
Hokkaido in October is the best experience.

If you don't have any experience don't bother. You'll not find much help planning your trip online. Plan yourself off of topo maps.

It is if you're already planning to do other things in Japan, and climb it to see the sunrise. Seeing the sunrise on Mt Fuji is one of the most beautiful views I've seen in my entire life, and it isn't a taxing climb for anyone in shape.

Thank you. I'll probably end up going to Hokkaido eventually. Planning off of topo maps shouldn't really be an issue for me.

I think this will end up being the most optimal solution. I don't expect as much people being there early early in the morning as in the noon or thereafter. The idea of a sunrise atop that mountain is what I'll base my expectations now, I think.

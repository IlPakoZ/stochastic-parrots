What's stopping you from going outside?
This is the thread we use to talk about our problems and personal issues stopping from spending more time /out/.

Be honest and open anons. This is a safe space. No normies allowed.

its muddy as fuck outside right now, the winter snow was almost fully melted and then it snowed another 20cm this week. maybe by the end of the month

When I had a job I didn't have enough time to go/out/
Now I don't have enough money. Retarded poorfag who can't drive so any decent out trip means spending like 50 on public transportation and I can't even pay my bills

 Bit of laziness, and most of my “free time” is spent improving the property(garden, other projects)
But mostly laziness and taking things for granted. It’s quite sad.

fuckin soaked an muddy here, rained all day yesterday and pretty much rained all last week, ran some errands today and it is fairly cool so that's been nice

to be honest because most places are owned by retards that make the forests private property

>>2564420 (OP)
I only work 21 hours a week so I have lots of free time most of which I spend gathering and splitting firewood to sell for some extra cheese. 
There is nothing stopping me from going to new places during the day because my job starts in the evening, the weather is getting better and I have a few spots on my list to visit. 
I'm a cunt so I don't travel much during the winter time. 
I really cant imagine working over 40+ hours a week for someone else without a real sense of purpose, but I admire people who manage to do that. 

Pic related is my Easter fire, it has been going strong for 8 days lmao.

It really is no surprise though, I think we just simply forget that seasons come and go kek.

If people were more respectful I’d be okay letting people hike or camp on my land.
But I live in Oregon so they’d a)never leave b) invite their hobo junkie friends c) shut the place up (literally) and leave all manner of trash lying around.

I feel your pain though, growing up dad and I’d try to find places to camp/set up the telescope, and it was no trespassing sign after no trespassing sign.

I will say though, if it’s Weyerhaeuser land, or some other absentee landowner (think corps or conservation trusts out of CA) it’s your civic duty to trespass

Wish Canada had this shit
90% of the province is crown land with pretty free usage, which is great, but you still come across gated backcountry roads(even publicly funded ones) and private land blocking access to public land all the time, and it's getting gradually worse.

I feel you brah, it gets me mad that niggers can fuck with the forest with their trash 

but you're right, I want to try it out tomorrow ngl, I'll trespass no matter what, fuck those retarded rules, I don't even know if there are any laws about it in Brazil
--- 2564665
>>2564635
Relative to most of the world it's still pretty good, legal wild camping on crown land puts it well ahead of a lot of developed countries, and 90% is not an exaggeration, BC land is apparently 94% public, even if most of that is 10 hours drive from anywhere. The physical country itself is easily in the top 3 of the planet, largely because it's huge and has world class examples of nearly every biome, but outdoor shit is commercializing more and more and the government is complicit in giving private companies leases on key areas that gate access to wild backcountry, logging companies are less and less likely to allow easy public access to forest service roads which is a bit of a legal grey area, and all these problems are a lot worse the closer to a town you get, which is somewhat understandable because normalfags cause problems but degrading access to nature is a real issue.

Also, I feel depressed going /out/ when jobless. I just feel directionless and like a complete bum.

i'm a retarded poorfag who never learned how to drive. and it feels like even if i did learn and get a license there's no way i could afford car insurance on top of my other current expenses, which means even if i got a license i legally wouldn't be able to drive, and if i can't drive i can't get to any good wilderness areas. there's a hiking trail near by i can ride my bike to but that's about it and there's no camping allowed there so if the weather is good i can hike for a few hours before going home and that's it.
--- 2567292
i went /out/ on easter and got assaulted by no less than 30 ticks despite spraying my clothes in permethrin beforehand, when i got home monday i used my dogs flea and tick killing shampoo because i was so paranoid i missed 10 more
it didn't help that i was using a polish lavvu, i really need to invest in a tipi style tent that has an inner mesh portion to keep insects out because i woke up covered in ants

>What's stopping you from going outside?
Unironically? I live in Japan now, and I have no idea what the rules and regulations are. The last thing I want is to be going to some campsite and breaking some implicitly known thousand year old law because the culture is different and suddenly a dozen nip gendarmes haul me in for crimes against the forest spirits.
--- 2567686
>>2564420 (OP)
the woods out here are too small and teenagers will come harass me if i loiter too long without molesting a child or buying drugs
i love camping but the outdoors are TOO accessible
wish there was some proper wilderness to disappear into for a week or two without having to make an international trip

I see shit in the corner of my eyes all the time and I've gradually become terrified to even leave my room through the years. I used to go /out/ but it's impossible now, I'm constantly terrified near to a panic attack, recently it's become hard to even be in the hallway or the kitchen at night.

I no longer have any gear as well and broke most of the time. on top of that there's just fucking people everywhere now, even my favorite trails are now crowded with families of 30 pajeets being annoying as hell or the entire forest was bulldozed for new suburbs

I live north of Toronto and 20 years ago it used to be amazing. just pack up with my friends and go camp on some island a buddy's friend knows about. end up partying with random people who also show up to camp.
now every inch of lakefront property has been sold to rich fucks and developed to hell and back. you need to travel an entire day by car to avoid it
--- 2569639
Thanks for posting anon. As soon as 5:00 comes around I’m putting on my boots and getting the dog out for a hike.

It’s kind of a shame to live out here and not spend more time outside
--- 2569640
I am physically unable to catch a single fish as of late and it's got me down in the dumps. Where the fuck are they all?
--- 2570083
I live in the Amazon region. Everything wants to kill you once you step out. I want to go out, but I'm not prepared and it would take a long time to learn from the right people. My intention is to first get a kayak, and find a spot where I can camp and fish for a few days.

You don't need to larp to be outside. The people that take the larp too seriously and don't have any self awareness for how out of touch they are, they are cringe. You're not that silly, are you? Even if you are, if you really believe the larp crap then why care? Do you care about your appearance or not? If you really care about your appearance you can larp and not look like a retard taking it too far.
--- 2570466
>>2567286
Make friends. Even ones that aren't ideal. Join a local hiking group. Check your areas Facebook pages for clubs. There's people like you, looking for people to hang with. You just have to put in the effort to try and find them.

Man I've been working around 60 hours a week for the past 2 years but I get a real sense of purpose from it and sleep well. The owners of the dairy and beef farm I work on are getting old and their adult children want nothing to do with it, so I've helped them through their ravages of old age by keeping shit going when one of them is off work for months getting a knee replacement and the other is off getting a hip replacement. They love their cows and I've learned to love the cows as much as the cows love me back as the designated Feeder Of Silage and Treatmaster

These. Being outside isn't hard (but it is hard?) if you choose to work in rural jobs or happen to be born into the location and lifestyle. I made the deliberate choice to move out here and work 12 hour days fisting cows and driving plows in circles because the scenery and freedom is a novelty to me, but people that grow up in this environment want nothing to do with it

As someone who is forced to be /out/ from the moment I leave my house, it's terrifying living alone remotely. There's snakes that are longer than you are tall casually slithering around, and spiders the size of your hand casually booping around your doors and windows, and bunyips or yetis or skinwalkers or some shit that screech in the middle of the night. Whenever I stay in the city or with friends in suburbia I sleep like a log. There's no Spooky Hoot, there's no multi-legged skittering across your face, and there's no unexplained lights in the night sky. From one grown anon to another, there's no shame in feeling fear

I'm a student with strict parents, can't leave the house for more than a couple hours, even that after getting permission to go out, plus I live in suburbia, so no place nearby to enjoy the wonders of nature. How do I get /out/ bros?

--- 2571952
The constant wind. I live in the windiest damn place in America. Every camping trip is a losing battle, every day fishing is whitecaps on the lakes, every hike is the wind tearing at your clothes and dust and sand blowing into your eye sockets. I now understand why people live in houses.

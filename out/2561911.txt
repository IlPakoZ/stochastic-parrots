Any bird watchers here? This isn't my usual board I just wanted to see if anybody wanted to talk about birds. Pic related is a heron at my local park. I don't have a good camera so I took a pic with my phone through some cheap binoculars. For some reason I can't get it to not post sideways.

I would love to do it but professional cameras are expensive, so I just photograph animals and plants within my reach and post them on inaturalist to archive them and get help with identifications. 
The birds I photograph are usually either dead or blurry and distant.
--- 2563108
Yeah birds are cool, I should go out more often and need a larger lense. I use a 55-300 now

This time of year is prime birdwatching season for me. Spring migration is in full effect and there are large wildlife preserves near me with ponds and relatively dry walking paths. I'm hoping to finally see and photograph a wood duck this year. Most larger birds (eagles, ospreys, hawks, herons, egrets) are kind of meh to me now. And Canadian geese are the absolute worst.

I enjoy bird watching. Eastern Phoebes are nesting on the side of my house and it's really cool to watch them build their nest. When I'm off work I like to watch the Chickadees, bluebirds, and gold finches that come to my bird feeder.

Sure, I enjoy watching birds. Not to the point of taking pictures of them and learning names, but I like them.
I have a uncanny ability of finding dead birds though.

Used to do it a ton as a kid. I could identify basically every species of bird in my area way back in middle school. Im not nearly as hardcore about it now, but I like to watch them sometimes while I'm hiking or something. Every spring and fall when I go fishing at the river I always see tons of kingfishers there with the same idea as me. Maybe I'll take some pictures of my own from now on.

dont take pictures but love bird watching. Always exciting to see something uncommon. Saw a large flock of cedar waxwings at a local park and hearing a brown-headed cowbird for the first time is quite special!

Screenshot image, crop, and post.
I wish I knew more about birds. I even got a peterson california bird book. I took some with a canon with super zoom (best way to "get close" without spooking.)

Funny looking turkey there, bub. What's it taste like?
--- 2564637

I think its a vulture. These guys are my garbage disposals when I kill squirrels. I leave squirrel on tree of sacrifice and they clean em up. 

Heres a photo of a I believe this is a Red Breasted Sap Sucker

Just got back from the park. Saw some Canadian geese, red-winged blackbirds, Bluejays, mocking birds, a great blue heron, and a pied-billed grebe. The grebe was really exciting cause I had no idea what the funky little duck was. He was swimming underwater to get away from me just to pop up on the other side of the lake. Here is a picture of a mallard with what I belive to be a domestic mallard. It was brown and white, slightly larger, and a lot braver than the other ducks there. Thank you for subscribing to my blog

I don't know much about birds other than I like seeing them while out. I use a phone app called 'Merlin' to help me ID birds. Saw a Pileated Woodpecker on a hike yesterday, was too busy staring at it to take a picture.
One thing I'd suggest to anons with cameras, try taking the pictures anyways, even if you just have the kit lens for your camera, you might be able to crop your way to an okay picture!

Went out yesterday to spot bluebreasts. Had quite a lot of fun. Also saw a white tailed eagle fly over.

I saw a Great Horned Owl for the first time last week. It landed in the grass beside the road when I was driving. It was so big I thought it was a goose when it landed.

Herons are neat. I see them flying all the time.
At night they are like mini stealth bombers.
--- 2566660
>>2566655
Yeah, they're fairly common. Just saw one the other day.
--- 2566672
>>2564229
Why do you "hate" them? WHats the point of letting them bother you so much that you feel compelled to kill them? Do you have other issues?
--- 2566673

the older and wiser I get the more Im into birds. Takes patience and focus to really notice how many different ones there are.

They clean out trout. And they're assholes too. We basically have pet trout in our dammed up crick. I've seen them peck and kill lots of trout and they never eat it. It rots. Or you'll have 50 trout and you'll have 20 in your area and there will be 5 trout left if you're lucky. We have 24/7 cameras on our trout. They clean out cricks. Endangered my ass.

The entire reason wild trout are rare in most areas and they have to stock trout for sport fishing is because of dams, and overfishing by humans. trout aren't even common prey for birds because they live in current. birds like that usually prefer stillwater shallows.
--- 2567217
Lots of birds where I live. Great Blue Herons, Green Herons, American Bitterns, Least Bitterns, Wild Turkeys, you name it. I need to buy a cheap tripod and mounting system so I can attach my phone camera to my binoculars and get some pictures. I live right beside some wetland and ponds and I watch them hunt as I fish in my kayak. I always try to take videos with just my phone camera but it comes out shit since they're so far away.

We have natives, go to any crick and you will see falls and natural dams. Trout can easily jump up stream to spawn into the dam and above the dam where there is obviously no blockage retards

I saw a bird that looked very similar to that years ago but I've never been able to work out what it is. Does anyone what species looks like that but lives around Brisbane, Australia? It's been annoying me for years.

It's the best time for birding in my area. Spring migration, birds changing into their breeding plumage, and the trees are still bare enough to see gems like this Great Horned Owlet. Pic is from last year but I've found two nests with owlets this year as well.

most creeks, lakes, ect are not natural to start with. probably made around the 60s or 70s by the core of engineers.

somehow a vulture got to australia or you saw a bird that is thought to be extinct.

Good thing there was a thread up!

I just went to the store and bought an Apple, I chewed off a few pieces of the peel and threw them to two crows, then thier friends arrived so I threw a few more.

I'm about to finish my coffee and go back to the crows and feed them som more apple scraps. How many times would it take until the same crows recognize me as thier fren?

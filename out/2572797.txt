>overnight camp
you could literally just sleep by a tree on the ground if you were so inclined
literally just bring whatever you want

humanity, the homeless, kids who ran away from home, /out/ anons, and everything in between have been doing this since time immemorial 
so yes, spending a single night outside, as opposed to inside, probably won't make mustardgas; you will however, probably be covered in ticks when you wake up though
so just buy like a sleeping or a tent or some shit

For a single night? Cheap tent, cheap sleeping bag, something to eat and some whiskey.

If its your land, you can do what you want. Watch some videos about camping with a tarp, and go pitch a plowpoint. Watch for ticks! That's about it.

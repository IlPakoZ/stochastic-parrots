>hey fellow /out/doorsmen! I need to know which is the highest quality cup brand. I currently own the CumMug 2.0 2011 Edition but it adds 0.001 ounces more than I am comfortable with so I am willing to splurge on something nice.

>>2566417
btw I'm trans if that matters
--- 2566439
I like Stanley with removable cup
--- 2566444

Takes up no room, is light and easy to handle without burning your hands.

for me, it's my insulated Yeti mug. it was a gift. I fell in love with it the first time I brought it /out/, it was like 3ºC and pouring rain up in the Brindabellas and I just sat under my tarp and kept the tea pouring and it was glorious

>>2566159 (OP)
i like the small foldacup in purple
--- 2566546
>>2566444
Nice digits, but it's hard to pour coffee with that configuration
--- 2566554
>>2566159 (OP)
I found an old thick copper cup while metal detecting. It's covered in runes and if you drink out of it you never die.
--- 2566566
>>2566545
A friend of mine in the scouts would always buy the purple ones, then soak them in bleach, so they turn a really awful lavender-ish color, so people wouldnt steal his cup
--- 2566569

Plus they also make a good autism toy

you should limit how much you expose aluminium to heat for food or drink, a lot of studies point to it having negative health effects later in life such as alzheimers, no consensus on exposure ammount though, but best avoided if possible
--- 2566979
>>2566964
The aluminium causing alzheimers has been deboonked afaik.

Shot a nice Fallow in the Brindabellas last year. Great place to camp

12cm Imusa mug. They’re $9 on Amazon. Sometimes Walmart has them. It holds 40oz, while the smaller 10cm is like 30oz (not really sure). BatchStovez makes lids for these mugs for about the same price as the mug itself. There are lots of DIY solutions to insulating the handle, usually wrapping it in some kind of fiberglass lamp wick or silicone of some kind.

A good ol' Kuksa or a simple stainless steel canteen cup. Found some pretty good pieces of wood a while back, and have been planning to make my own Kuksa.

It turns out “the Science” was leading researches in the wrong direction for the last 16 years by insisting on the aluminum/amyloid hypothesis, faking research, ignoring other studies that didn’t fit the consensus, and withholding grants.

This one is probably more than 11 years old. I have a second new one in case this one breaks or melts or whatever.

I love this little fosters pot, it's really simple just a beer can with the top cut and the walls rolled down on each other for a light kinda vacuum seal. It's just really comfy any time I use it.

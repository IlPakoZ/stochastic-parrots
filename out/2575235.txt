Your option is to become a corporate shill or become a cooperate shill.
Environmental science isn't a stand alone science--it is a fluff degree created corporations to train pseudo intellectual lackeys that don't actually know anything about science or the environment.

I have a cousin-in-law that fishes for a living and makes good money. I've never had a long conversation about it with him, but how the fuck is it possible? He has so many sponsors and shit that buy him a new boat every season and sends him gear all the time, and he just sells it off and makes massive bank. Meanwhile I'm working a shitty 9-5 office cuck faggot job.

Go to grad school for botany-biology or mycology and if you like it you can literally stay in school for decades doing research. Connections are more important than education but education can get you those connections.
I've yet to meet an "environmental scientist" that wasn't a government or corporate shill.

Fun fact the money a state makes on the timber and mining industries is the backbone of the state income. States like WA lie about being environmentally friendly but the timber industry basically runs the state. The state will never ever implement good policy because it would ruin their income so they hire idiots to justify timber practices and those idiots are called "environmental scientists"

WA and Oregon shouldn't ever log the lowland costal rainforests.

Most people I've talked to did their undergrad in environmental science and went into grad school for something related to their job or something they were interested in. I work for the forest service but many people in my states agency did the same thing. They are not all corporate shills lol

What kind of outdoor work do you want to do? You should be getting work experience in something you are interested in

maybe you should try tree planting. it's pretty miserable but it's definitely a humbling experience and you can make a lot of money if you go really hard. the first year maybe not but your second season is like the comeback year.

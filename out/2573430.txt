Hi, has anyone of you used pic related? I got the large version here:
https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32791660686.html
I have not used it yet, but so far the design looks sturdy. I like that the top ring is closed so it cannot bend open under heavy load. I don't really plan on hiking with it, just use it at festival-like gatherings to play with fire. What I have learned from youtube reviews of similar stoves is that for best performance, the twigs should not be too smal, and it needs to be lit from the top. What are your experiences?

You don't know what wood gas is if you think that is burning it.

why does ali express trigger you so much? where did chang touch you?

The alternatives are a campfire, gas or propane stove, or electric stove. This is basically a grill that you put a fire in. I don't see why it wouldn't work, may need an axe or to just gather fuel by hand. Now wood gasifier pickup trucks that's some North Korean tech and it really works, have seen them in the USA as well.

I have that exact one in your picture op, it works well enough and is also pretty novel with how it burns. 
I paid 15 dollars for it on AliExpress in 2014.

OP here, thanks! :-)
Any experience how well refuelling while using it works? Some say the ash will block the primary air over time, so if you need it for a long time, you have to interrupt and pour out everything once in a while...

yes
I know the difference between marketing bullshit and actual scientific terms.
You clearly don't.

The ash pan thing will definitely fill up, bit you can just shake it out and push it over to a spot with less ash. 
It's very easy to keep fed though.

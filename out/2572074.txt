Can anyone tell me what the fuck this is? It appeared in one corner of my balcony. The white dots are because I sprayed it with bug spray since there were a lot of spiders in there.

When I sprayed nothing moved inside or anything. Should I be concerned? It looked different to all the other spiderwebs I saw in there.

I'd have just left it, and looked at it while smoking.

Imagine using sprayable poisons on the natural world around you out of fear/alienation.

Reminds me of A Scanner Darkly by PKD
Woman calls main character and his friend and asks them to help kill a big spider at her house
They get there and say “oh it’s harmless, it can’t hurt you”
The woman replies with “Well if I knew it was harmless I would have killed it myself”
Idk why, but that part always stuck with me

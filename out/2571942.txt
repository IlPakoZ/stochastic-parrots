I want to explore Mexico and do some backpacking, starting with the area around Juarez in Baja California. Has anyone done /out/ in Mexico? Any Mexico anons here?

If you speak Spanish: go to Patagonia or southern Chile. Mexico is the mexico of mexico, worse, it's full of mexicans.

I don't have the funds for that kind of fun. Baja is only 3 hours away and as a kid I went camping all over Baja with my family. Nothing but good times and very safe back then, but now it's listed as level 3 by the state department, which means "reconsider travel" because of the risk of being murdered. But how great is the risk? I can be murdered right here in my small town by a redneck or a mexican gangbanger from Las Vegas (niggers don't come to this town). I don't want to drive or hike into a death zone in Mexico, so I need to know how to avoid them. Talk to the locals?

doesn't the government say not to go to Mexico right now because of the government/cartel war. your a total fucking retard, he would be lucky to have a gun in that situation. 

you would be the sort of person to end up like other tourists who run away scared when something terrible happens who you've fucked up backpacking through cartel territory

It's funny, there's really nothing going on in almost every state in the country, you Americans think Mexico is just two cities, the truth is it's a pretty big country, it's more likely that if you go into the wilds of the country you'll get kidnapped by a tribe of communists or eaten by a coyote, If you want to go exploring be careful and know where you will be because if you disappear no one will bother to look for you.

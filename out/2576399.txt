Not OP but I just can’t get into fishing, is it just zoomer brain? I love hunting and camping but get so fucking bored fishing

Read the guides on the Fishing &amp; Tackle thread >>2572120 → as a decent starting point. Don't take that as gospel however, rather use it as a springboard to start doing your own research. Don't be afraid to ask questions in that thread or ask people at local sporting goods stores.

The point of fishing isn't to try and maximize your efficiency at catching fish, its a passive activity. It sounds like you definitely have zoomerbrain.

Keep walking-it reduces anxiety and stress levels

Your doctor is right, but in order to actually enjoy the outdoors you first need to break all your other dopamine addictions, such as vidya, tv, social media, and porn. You need to reset your attention span.

Get an ebike and you can go good distances for less effort, quicker than walking, good enough exercise, is enjoyable.

Thanks, I will look into that thread

Dunno about that, it's what everybody says and I'm going to continue, but it just never really worked for me that way. I also got flatfeet so walking becomes almost unbearably painful after a while, I even got over pronation countering shoes but they don't really seem to work. I've done some cycling before which is better for me than walking, but still don't really get any good feelings from it either. Heard about runners high but never experienced anything like it. I guess my brain receptors are burnt to shit with living unhealthy lifestyle. And even though I realize it's good for my health, it's incredibly hard to keep any motivation up when there's no positive feelings connected to it.
>>2576454
Very much true. I'd really need a total change in my lifestyle, because my whole life currently consists of things you mentioned

First for best telescopic rod is the one you exchanged for a 3pc.

>>2572120 (OP)
I know nothing about flies, but want to try some on an UL spinning rod. Is it much of a challenge casting with some split shot and an indicator? What sort of flies nyphms streamers should I try first? Am I better off just getting a beginner fly rod and practicing. Mainly want to target trout in a river, but might try for bass and bluegill in the ponds
--- 2572127
Why do I feel uneasy about 2 piece rod. As soon as I started using a lightweight 1pc rod, my beginner 2pc feels like it could break at anytime.
--- 2572134
>>2572118 →
I like these ones
--- 2572137
>>2572125
Use the smallest bobber you can get away with, consider looking in to casting bubbles, and any nymph size 10-16 should work for bluegill. Grasshopper dry flies are the goat in summer, especially with dry/dropper rig. Wooly buggers and other streamers for bass, then trout will go after Adam's, elk hair caddis, pheasant tail nymphs, frenchies, zebra midges, streamers like wooly buggers, and terrestrial like ants and crickets. 
>>2572125
>Am I better off just getting a beginner fly rod and practicing
Yes, if you want to do trout bluegill and bass with one combo get a 6 weight.

I’ve been looking at some sub $100 5/6wt kits on Amazon that have had my eye for a bit, just never pulled the trigger. There’s a guy who fly fishes at my local pond and his advice to me was get high quality line. Thank you for the information
>>2572127
Your 1 piece probably is just overall higher quality materials and built than your beginner 2 piece. Daiwa and Megabass make high end 4 piece travel rods that you couldn’t tell the difference versus 1 piece
--- 2572159
these in the smallest size i can get away with
--- 2572163

>>2572154
>There’s a guy who fly fishes at my local pond and his advice to me was get high quality line.
this is my recommendation as well for starting out, you'll notice way more benefit from a quality line than you will from a fly rod
--- 2572195
>>2572125
>>2572125
you don't really want to use an actual fly fishing indicator as they usually will be too light. Instead just use a small weighted bobber and let the fly sink weightless. The actual style of bobber is up to you, just need the weight.
--- 2572212
>>2572154
>>2572165
I've only ever fished with cheap lines and haven't had any big issues with them aside from the float tips getting dirty and sinking after not too long. Casting-wise is more technique than line quality imo.

still no any open water in my area and they wont start selling permits until after 2 months

>>2572125
I do it all the time using 5ft ul rod, 8lb braid, oros idicator, 3ft of 6x tippet and whatever nymph is working at the time. Will also trail the nymph with 8-12” of same the tippet and a size 18 or 20 scud. I Fish smaller wild trout streams and it works just fine. Will also run the same set-up on a 6’6” spinning rod in bigger water. Was forced to try this due to an elbow injury which wouldn’t allow me to swing a fly rod. Can “pitch” the flies pretty easy with this rig.
--- 2572343
are megabass rods are fragile as they seem
--- 2572354
>>2572343
Yeah, they're fragile. And besides their Arms Super Leggera (the fancy, $1,000 rod), their entire line-up of rods are all manufactured in China. Biggest reason I don't touch them. For how much they charge, they better be made in Japan, but they aren't. 

Nice rods, but I think Shimano/Loomis and St. Croix are better.
--- 2572370
I don't care if you're deadsticking or doodling, finnesse fishing with a splitshot rig sure is a handy way to hit your limit
--- 2572427
2nd day of committing to swimbaits: 17 inch laker on 4 inch glide. Any tips for locating smallmouth opposed to other fish? This lake is know to have big smallmouth and lakers. I've been catching lakers pretty consistently fishing off of points near dropoffs where the bottom is cobble. I have caught decent smallmouth in the past around rock bottom but I don't want to throw my swimbaits there because they would get snagged for sure.
--- 2572441

>>2572427
>I've been catching lakers pretty consistently fishing off of points near dropoffs where the bottom is cobble
Sounds to me like you already know where they are. That's precisely how I locate my smallies.

Throw an open water glidebait over those same spots, a XSS or SS and just fish the top water column. It'll call those fish from the bottom to come look. If you spot them coming up very aggressive, you're 100% getting bit. Once they're following and trying hard to bite it, work it aggressively chopping it. 

If you're fishing next to walls or cliffs, throw it parallel to the cliff/wall and keep your glide hugging the wall, almost banging it on the wall when you glide it. If there's a shade line near said wall, throw it parallel with the shade line and work it in and out of that shade line. 

Throwing a snagless softbait over that cobble can work too, like a 6" magdraft freestyle, citizen 6" (hard to get), huddleston 68, etc.
--- 2572567
What is your opinion on spaded hooks? The hook stays always in the right position when the line is wrapped around the shank. You can do this with ringed hooks too with knotless knot but its nearly impossible to tie micro hooks without knot tying tool and that does not work with ring hooks.
--- 2572572
>>2572125
What skid said. I'd use a very small float for both the weight and as an indicator
>>2572127
Besides specific transporting constraints there are only downsides to using a multi-piece rod. Just the addition of an area which is more likely to break. Plus the decreased sensitivity makes it less desirable for any bottom contact baits
>>2572370
Out of curiosity what plastic are you using with that split shot rig?
>>2572490
Very nice 
>>2572491
You're bowfishing so you have goofed yourself into irredeemable shame
>>2572534
Because the Japanese are not advertising to bubba. They're advertising to people who care about the gear they use rather than the lowest common denominator

Suck it up, or alternatively stop hooking the pike that deep. It should only ever happen with deadbait. Ive been angling for pike for 20 years and ive never lost a lure because it was too deep, as in literally never
--- 2572619

I dont really see the point of them, but i generally dont do that kind of fishing so that might be why. I occasionally run into them pretied for herring for which i guess they are fine

Where can I buy some arrows that have like the screw on arrow heads I was thinking maybe maybe buying 4 arrows and the tips just to break in and hope no arrow through the hand happens my old buddy showed me videos of like arrows exploding into the hand between the middle part where the thumb and index finger are.
--- 2572816
Anybody else weigh their lures ? Lots of bullshit weights. Like 1/2 ounce plugs only weight 4/10 of an ounce.
--- 2572820
>>2572816
How accurate is your scale and how chinese are your lures?
--- 2572832
>>2572816
>>2572820
Just sense their weight in your hand and adjust according to how much they sink.
--- 2572840
Honestly, in hand, I can't really tell the difference between 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2. I can feel the cast difference of all of them on the same rod though.
--- 2572846
>>2572813
What in the fucking hell are you trying to say. Speak English.
--- 2572850
>>2572820
my scale is accurate. lots of lure manufacturer are lazy as shit. even something basic like softplastics length, if you take a tape measure to them no measurement even lines up with their model name.
--- 2572851
>>2572832
it's really hard to guestimate weights if two objects are different densities. e.g. a floating minnow plug vs a lead head jig.
--- 2572853
>>2572281
Use one of those

Couple of each:
Spinner Baits, crank baits, senkos (light/dark), swim jigs w/ trailers, swim baits, a topwater (light or dark), couple jerkbaits, mepps/panther martin/blue fox
That should cover mostly everything, It would help if you told us what species you are targeting or what the lake has

>>2572857
If you want to use the reel you already have, get a 7’9”-8’ medium heavy or heavy rod that can handle up to 4oz. Tie a 20lb leader to your braid. Get some s waver 168s in some shad and baitfish patterns and Magdraft freestyles too. Fuck it and go swimbait fishing, right now is a great time to catch some big hungry bass
--- 2573096
help me with my idea
>i will connect my leader with my braid with a double uni knot
>i will tie the snap on my leader with a clinch knot
>so if i snag up the leader will break on the snap and not on the connection between the lines
would that work?
--- 2573101
>>2573096
I do that but tied directly to the lure without the snap and yeah it usually works. Sometimes it breaks at the double uni if I tried it poorly or in the middle of the lease if the leader has a nick in it but usually it breaks at the clench.
--- 2573103
>>2573096
Learn to tie an fg knot or other stronger braid to leader knot and that will happen most of the time anyway.
--- 2573104

People keep telling me that panfish are idiot-proof. I've spent the last three days proving them wrong. Not a single sunny hit any of my lures. I could probably get some if I switched to worms, but I'm really not a fan of that style of fishing. I did manage to get some dink smallmouth so it's not like I'm completely skunked, but it bugs me that I haven't been able to catch a single sunfish yet.
--- 2573455
>>2573436
Artificials make them more difficult because smaller sunfish have a harder time eating lures and even if fish size isn't the issue sometimes they'll still miss the hook. Flies are the best artificial for sunfish.

I've been looking into tenkara recently and it's hilarious to me that the two biggest sources of info in the west have almost completely opposite viewpoints on it.
>Tenkara USA:
>"The noble art of tenkara is a technique that the masters in Glorious Nippon use to catch trout in picturesque mountain streams. True tenkara uses only a single reverse-hackled wet fly, and those sullying its good name with filthy Western flies aren't actually practicing tenkara, but instead the inferior 'fixed-line fly fishing' technique."

--- 2573609

You watch enough of the Japanese fishing channels, and you'll fall into the "It's fun and I don't give a fuck about special flies" camp.

I've recently upgraded from pier fishing to surf fishing. After my first foray I have come to a couple questions 

No matter how many video tutorials I watch, I just can't seem to read the surf. Either it's my local beach but the waves all seem to flow the same. I'm not able to easily see the rips or breaks. Is there a certain way I need to rethink how I see the surf?

Second was that lugging a tackle box for miles made me realize that I need to pack more efficiently. Are there any good tackle backpacks that can hold two rods and not cost me premium for what amounts to cheap Chinese material that rips on you after a few uses?
--- 2573926
>>2573909
https://youtu.be/3ydE4267zp8?t=531 [Embed]
I modded a shitty chinese tacticool backpack to hold a second rod like this.

I don't know what I can tell you about the surf that can't be explained in the videos. Use polarized sunglasses if you don't already. Look for the gaps in where and when the waves are breaking.
--- 2573936
>>2573909
The feature form differently depending on the conditions of the beach, slope, current, consistency of the sand. Not all beaches form the features you mentioned
--- 2573944
>>2573936
That's one thing those tutorials didn't mention. If I can't spot those currents or breaks on my beach, is there any other way other than just fab-casting at random spots until I get a bite?
--- 2573971
>>2573944
You just have to be better. All beach have some degree of structure. Even a basic trough will hold fish
My tip is to go out on a low tide/ low swell day with a polarized sun glasses. Even if the tide is too low, resulting water too shallow to fish, you can recognize structure better and might be able to come back there on higher tide
However, even I had regular productive days even on low tide. Sometimes fishes don't mind staying in the shallow

I like them a lot. I just got their Rio outbound shooting line knockoff and it was less than $20. I would recommend their lines to anybody. They're surprisingly very well made. I prefer them over my budget Rio lines. They cast and feel much better. You can't go wrong. Especially if you want to practice outside of the water so you don't tear up an expensive line.

--- 2574363
convince me to go braid over copoly
i legit can't tell a difference with sensitivity and it casts like total shit
--- 2574377
>>2574363
are you making the mistake of using same # or greater braid as the copolymer ? Line casts better then thinner it is, simple as that. Braid is typically underrated significantly in line strength as well, the breaking strength is not what it will break at but rather guaranteed minimum strength.
--- 2574378
>>2574377
usually 6# copoly and anywhere from 15 to 40 braid depending on what i'm doing
--- 2574396
>>2574378

6# braid will cast better or about the same as 2# mono and will be stronger than 6# copoly. I use 15# braid for fishing for striped bass and bluefish in saltwater, would be overkill for most types of freshwater fishing I do.

>>2574473
You can find the reel on Amazon/Ebay for $10-20 instead of on TWH. And yes you need more line, that's only about half of the capacity.
--- 2574479
>>2574473
You need to fill out a reed's spool for it to cast properly. Look at the capacity on your reed's rating and match that. 
Personally, I would go for 15-20 lb braid to cover all options but 10 lb mono is fine as well for beginner
--- 2574521
>>2573936
This is what I was talking about. The more exposed beaches see more errosion due to tides and are constantly changes forming the feature mentioned. Other beaches are protected from the elements and on those beaches you will find more fish on the ends where the structure is that protects the beach(rocks), rather than along the beach shore. Someone else can probably give better explanations.

Had one that hit the top fly of my dry dropper rig (green foam grasshopper) and just as I was about to land it after a good fight on my 6wt it unhooked itself. After that, I was stalking 8+ of them and casting in front of their direction of movement but couldn't get hit. Really sad when they rose to the surface, bumped it with their nose without even opening their mouths, then swam away. Happened many times over 3+ hours, maybe their buddy told them to stay away from that spooky grasshopper. They seemed to be rising to grab either tiny tiny insects I couldn't see or leaves falling around them. Pic related is one I got on the bottom of my dry dropper (prince nymph) a little over a week ago, it was my first carp catch and now I want more.

Try other terrestrials, cottonwood seed flies. If you know any mulberry trees that overhang the water a mulberry fly works, and I've heard of people using attractor patterns for them like royal Wulff's 
You could also try moss flies or weightless nymphs if a near surface eat is satisfactory

Very next cast with the same lure caught this Black &amp; Yellow Rockfish, also missed a few bites on the same lure. The water was dark but but good visibility, and the day was overcast. I made some other lures with a lot of flake (glitter) I wanted to try out but the sun never came out

Anons, does your wife or gf fish with you?
My wife has recently shown an interest in fishing and has gone on like a dozen trips with me and not a single one has been pleasant.
>Constantly asking me to put a worm on her hook because she finds it too gross.
>Refuses to take the fish off the hook.
>Will complain to go home if it gets slightly cold.
>Will complain to go home if they are midges flying about.
>Has no patience at all.
>Can not handle walking on uneven terrain.
I figured she would quit because of how much she doesn't seem to enjoy it but she keeps suggesting to plan fishing days and coming with me whenever I head out.

thanks I will get more line and I think I will try braid for the first time. When you say that I need to fill out the whole spool for proper casting, say my line has broken a few times and I've lost some length. Do I need to respool the whole thing, top it off, or is this something you just do as yearly maintenance to prevent overall degradation?
--- 2574678
>>2574661
don't go with braid as a first timer
you'll have to break off a shitload before you ever notice a loss in performance and even then it would only be casting distance at worst

She never wanted to do fishing, she wanted to do something fun, new, and with you. The peaceful lest stress aspect, and a skill she can open her brain to learning something new, away from the hell of modern society and city life, no traffic or people. 
Go out hiking or have a bon fire, eventually she possibly will want to try camping. Make it fun, teach her the trees, birds, animals, history, then be really really impressed when you later ask her an she remembers!

I did start the day off with a really bright one and landed thus black rockfish third cast. This is when the overcast wasn't too bad and I had hopes of the sun coming. I switched to a darker swimbait and caught the other 2 because not just the overcast but the water clarity started going to clear but dark to a foggy or milky. I thought in conditions like that it would be better to throw a dark bait because a light one might just blend in with the foggy water, and a dark bait would create more a silhouette and that would get the fishes attention. I'll see if I can find a picture of the water I was fishing and I would appreciate any color combination recommendations
--- 2574756
>>2574690
This is what the water clarity turned into, this is northern CA , used a weedless Texas rig. What colors would you guys throw, I think I can make most colors, and have access to a bunch of different glitter, and can make soft plastic paddle tail type baits in 3.5", 3.8", 4.0", and 5.0"

Finally used my baitcaster setup after 2 years. I think I still prefer the simplicity and castability of my ole spinning setup. Caught a spotty on my second cast then nothing for hours after. Saw some shit jumping out of the water but no taking or I suck ass.
--- 2574814
>>2574810
I personally really like the baitcaster after I get into kayak fishing and start fishing deeper water. The baitcaster ergonomic make it easier to fish from a kayak and also working the lures in deeper later. Casting distance doesn't matter that much from a kayak.

Telescoping rods are generally shit until you get into really expensive ones or niche products like tenkara poles, but you can still catch fish on shitty rods. Personally I'd recommend you get a cheapo 2-piece spinning combo instead if you're just starting out.

>>2574433
the only fishing line you can buy that is actually accurate is the stuff for line class records because its guaranteed to break at the rating. Let's say you pick up a random spool of 15# line from the store, it doesn't mean its actually breaking at 15#, it can be 18#, 22#, 25#, etc. its just marketing by the companies. Same thing with line thickness ratings, braided line is not a perfect circle or even oval, the line thickness some advertise is complete bs, and not an actually representative number.

spool tension knob, #5 on pic related, loosen it completely, then wobble your spool back and forth inside the baitcaster. Tighten the spool tension until the spool stops going side to side, it's now completely adjusted and shouldn't be touched. Every once and awhile check the side to side play hasn't come back.

All adjustments are done with your brakes. Turn all of them on or max settings, get used to throwing lures. Load up the rod and slowly let the rod do the work, don't force it. Have your thumb on the spool at all times until you get used to it, as you cast, let off the pressure on the spool with your thumb and let the spool let out line on the cast but still having minimal enough pressure for when it starts to backlash, you can slow down the spool. 

When you get better, lower the brake settings.
--- 2574989
>>2574981
Max out brake
Max out spool tension
Back off spool tension until you can wiggle the spool
Slowly add spool tension until it can't wiggle
Back off brakes as needed (heavy lure = less brakes; light lure = more brakes)
Lightly thumb the spool for more braking as needed (add thumb pressure as the lure is farther away from you or you risk a backlash because the spool is peeling line faster than the lure can pull it)

You can now baitcast

Bass are ugly and stupid fish that retards put into rivers for no reason other than to fish for them. The number of water systems that have been invaded by some retarded niggerfaggot bubba who dumped a bucket full of largemouth into it is in the hundreds if not thousands. These fish eat anything that moves and can live nearly everywhere. They are like if carp were predatory in nearly every regard, including the fact they aren't even a good eating fish. They are ugly, stupid, aggressive, and for some damn reason keep getting put everywhere. These fish are the niggers of our waterways and I despise bass "fishermen" for what they have done to the ecosystems of the great North American continent.

The fish sense there's a bitch on the other end of the line.

>>2574613 My housemate (male) is similar, he used to:

>Constantly ask to come fishing
>Not help at all in packing up to head out
>Complain that I'm not ready to leave while I rig up an extra rod for him 
>Refuse to bring his own tackle box
>grabs whatever lures look flashy without asking
>Refuses to relatch the tackle box after opening it, causing it to fly open and spill its contents when picked up
>Used my gloves to bait his hook because "Fuckin gross", didn't ask of course and put the filthy gloves right back in the tackle box.
>etc.

He did let me bum his cigarettes mercilessly, so it's not like he was a complete pain. Regardless it got to a point where I had to explain blunt as fuck "I go fishing to relax, not to fucking cater to people who want to come along, if you want to come and you can't be helpful, at least don't be a pain in my ass."

He's better now but last time we went fishing he borrowed my penn slammer III and rod, it had a stuck drag due to buying used and I told that motherfucker so many times not to try to unwind it as the reel will fall off. 

Guess what that nigger did knee deep in the surf.

I got the fucker serviced and he paid half, but holy fuck, some people are better left at home if they're gonna cause you consistent problems and bring a whiney attitude.

Not that any of my seething has anything to do with your girlfriend wanting to spend time with you. If I were you, I'd offer to plan some girl friendly trips for her so you two can chill while she whips lures around like a sexy idiot. If she wants to come on a regular trip, tell her to assume it'll be uncomfortable and she might bring her big girl pants.

Good luck anon and smack your girl on the ass for me.

Unless you have good experience with fishing, that tackle box actually seems to be a bit overkill and for larger fish. I would recommend getting some smaller hooks that panfish (bluegill) can eat. Real worms, not fake worms. 12lbs line is also probably overkill, I'd go with 8lbs monofilament. Doesn't sound as tough because 12>8 but for a first fishing outing you should be trying to go for bluegill and such and 8lbs will be plenty for good sized bass as well. Advantage of lighter line is that you'll be able to cast farther.
--- 2575818
>OSP do-live stick 3"
>Deps bull flat 2.5"
If you want to learn how to fish, I recommend just getting these 2 baits. Get small EWG hooks and throw them weightless, this is called free-rigging. Let it slowly flutter and then pop it. I never get skunked at heavily pressured urban city parks and locals think I'm a fishing wizard. I've frequently shown locals where the exact spots fish will hide, throw my plastic at the spot, and immediately get either a dink bass or a panfish. Every time. 

Just fish urban parks, you'll quickly learn how fish stick to structure and how they respond to stuff, where what species will be at, etc. If it's sunny and the sun is beating down on the water and there's no current, no moving water, fish are going to be ALL located in shade. The sunnier, the better since the spots will be very minimal. There's a key point.

She said to me she doesn't know how I can handle the way people treat me online I tell her at the end of the day honey these losers who have so much hate in their life that the only enjoy they get is to make others feel like shit. And you also have people who feel what your doing is a threat to some thing they are doing. I was trying to explain to her at the end of the day you could be 5'10 and weigh like 120lbs and people online will still judge you if I wasn't fat they be targeting my teeth so some times you just gotta troll them back and always remember we have the upper hand not them they're online when they come to us and say that on some thing we control then we and play there games like I said to her these jokers online have yet to come say anything to my face I'm not here to act like a tough guy online but I've been looking for some one to step up one down and catch me out fishing and try they trash talk because I'd love to throw a few I've had a itch for awhile to either kick someones ass or at least lose a fight trying cause some times a good bar fight wakes you up.

TLDR; No hard feelings hate me my wife and our dream of running a fishing club / bait shop / charter. Sorry we are obese.

Idea:
Import Bowfin to germany and stock them here together with bass.
--- 2575958
>>2575927
Yesss import bowfin, what could possibly go wrong?
--- 2575966
>>2575769
thanks for this advice, I'll pick up some small hooks and line, worms and bobbers tomorrow night so I'm all set. Rod should be coming tonight and I've been researching where I want to go Saturday morning. Lets goooooooooo!!
--- 2575967
How many worms do I buy for a day of fishing?
How do I learn how to put line on my rod/spinner?
--- 2575971
>>2575967
One package will be plenty, and youtube. If you only learn one knot learn the uni knot

Got a double the other day, on a dry-dropper rig. One hit the popper and the other chased down the flashback nymph, was fun
--- 2575991
>>2575900
what the hell are you talking about mate? Are you the bow fisher?
--- 2575994
Why should i tie the double uni knot If i can tie a Albright knot?
--- 2576002
>>2575994
no reason, albright is slimmer and just as strong if not stronger than double uni.
Though in the end it wont make a world of difference in most cases
--- 2576003
>>2576002
Thank you
I guess i will practice it then
--- 2576007

Caught a golden trout with a zebco slingshot and a joes flies spinner. Second trout I ever caught and fought damn hard.
--- 2576050
>>2576046
what part of the US are you in where you can catch these? We have a few lakes with this brook trout subspecies (aurora trout) a couple hours from me, thinking of making a trip to try and catch some this year.
--- 2576052

>>2576046
beautiful fish.
>zebco slingshot
Dont hear people talking about zebco often, but I feel like they are quite decent. I use a zebco trophy telescopic rod as my main travel rod and its been treating me very well
--- 2576075
>>2576060
Its a 10 dollar combo, really good deal. I want to get a baitcaster soon but I thought I would pick this up to try out breaking right before roots and other baitcaster activities before I put real money up.

>>2576050
"Golden" or Palominos trout (mutant rainbow trout) are often stocked along side rianbows. Usually a few hundred normal rainbows get stocked with a few bananas get thrown in for fun.

Don't tell me he hurt the sawfish...
--- 2576154
>>2576148
Someone made a comment about how bad he was handling his catch so he post a bunch of picture of him killing his catches and saying that people are just jealous that he is catching fishes
--- 2576157

I now don't like him. >:(

I'm pretty sure in Florida you are not allowed to take those out of the water you can get charged with I believe a fine at the very least did anyone report him?
--- 2576225

This thread is about dead so I'll get back to you cool cats in the next thread mean time I'll leave you with a picture to save.
--- 2576228
>>2576220
Yes we take them out of the water all the time when they're wrapped in fishing line to get the line off them and release them back into the water. We honestly don't really care what you liberals think about us removing that fishing from the water. We just respect the FWC wish and NOAA Fisheries by not posting pictures of them out of the water anymore on social media. 
If you really want to act like you care you can send the picture and give them our address maybe we can make a video laughing at nothing happening.

'conspirator', the one that isn't fully trout colored all the way, could only get 1 and a battleshad, wish I got 2 tyrants after seeing that rigging video, shit this is going to be fun to fish
--- 2576286
>>2576243
Nope I don't find a need to read any books that aren't a source of knowledge I rarely ever watch TV or movies for that matter. I like to use as much of my brain space for knowledge not potato. As hard as that may be to believe. 
But I spoke with FWC about my concerns I had about me having that picture with the sawfish the officer I spoke with advised I don't post the pictures on social media because it would make more people think it's okay to do that.

But I assure you that if you think I care if any of you report me to FCW or NOAA I'm not in the least worried about them doing anything to me. It's almost like swatting as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully they will come for you for wasting their time on something they already handled.
--- 2576288
Not like I'm keeping the sawfish protected fish or not I'd rather remove my line and crimp the hook then to just cut the line on that sawfish but it's okay. There's no way to justify my actions in the picture of me holding that sawfish that way I would agree to this day doing that was a huge and embarrassing thing to do. But at the same time I use that picture as a perfect example for others to never do that kinda shit which is why I started what I have going with my LLC but we still catch fish and kill them for bait I'm sorry if that offends you. Sometimes we go fish for invasive fish like the Mayan Cichlids and just leave them to die on land or keep them for cut bait.

i need some snaps but i don't know what size, basically as small as possible for some shallow cranks
--- 2576320
>>2576311
I use the smallest size VMC crank snaps (CRS#00) and smallest size Gamakatsu Duo Lock snap swivels (size 12). I dunno if the crank snaps really make that much of a difference, but they should in theory. it's best to remove the split ring from lures when using them though to offset the added weight. the snap swivels are retardedly expensive for a 5 pack but they are extremely small and quality.
--- 2576325
the topwater popper bite has been on fire lately. I think a fethered treble in the rear really makes a difference.
--- 2576329
>>2576320
i only use snap swivels on my ultralight stuff since sunfish don't give a shit
snaps are just handy for crankbaits
--- 2576331
>>2576329
I use them for all kinds of shit because I don't like tying knots and I switch lures a lot. I've even used those small snap swivels on ned rigs with straight braid and still caught bass.
--- 2576335
>>2576331
yup, the idea that bass are line shy is a ridiculous notion
look at a deep diving jerkbait and how much shit hangs off of it and tell me with a straight face that line visibility makes a difference
--- 2576336
>>2576331
The only problem I've ever had with bass and snap-swivels is they being more interested in the swivel, than the lure.

Switched to black finished ones, that solved the problem.

Caught a cobia im the mangroves last week.

Which one do you use? I've been looking for a telescopic rod but no one will give me just an honest opinion on one
--- 2576404
I hate fishing.
Everybody ist catching nice fish but me. 
All i do is snag up and rip my line off
--- 2576406
>>2576404
what kind of fish and gear you using?
--- 2576408
>>2576404
Yo dude, keep working. Stick with it and build that skill, the fish will come. Enjoy nature thoroughly.
--- 2576427
>>2576404
Happens, had weeks where all I got where sunburns, snags and skunked. Whole days sun up to sundown wasted.

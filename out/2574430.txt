what is the final solution to the tent stake problem?
they are either light and shitty, or heavy and shitty
never last more then a couple trips, aluminium bends if you look at it wrong, plastic breaks if it even gets a little cold, even steal gets fucked

why are most designs so shit? gimmicky nonsense!

what can be done?

works for me

the MSR groundhogs do seem to be holding up. They won't survive being pounded into rock but nothing really will. The aluminum alloy is harder than the cheapo amazon stakes but you can also get the cheap ones in volume. I also carry some nail or hook stakes for very hard ground. It's a wear-part, they will eventually have issues if you're out long enough.

how heavy could some high strength steel pegs be?
--- 2574459
>>2574450
depends on a lot of factor, like thickness, length and stuff

These are big, but sturdy and light. 
I've yet to have one break or pull out. 
You can find them on Ebay very cheap.

I use Caughlan’s tent stakes locally. The ground is super Sandy in some spots and the extra length is perfect for the job. When I travel I use some shorter ones that are the same ubiquitous design. 

I’ve bent them before as well. It’s like super soft or super Sandy soil followed by what you’re hoping is clay or something but is a root or a rock. They still work.

#1 just works, #3 is shit, and fuck those super thick plastic ones that are impossible to pound into hard soil.

Another stake I've had luck with are the big aluminum nails you can find at Lowes or Home Depot. They are used for holding up gutters and are light and cheap.

NTA but I think he means landscape spikes like they use for party tents.

Here you go. They sometimes come with the plastic bits, those make for nice handles when doing cordwork.

While I do own a blue tarp, I do not camp under them. Too crinkly.

Uh.... why would you need this shit? Just put your bag in the tent, it won't go anywhere. I've camped in windy deserts, when the wind is really going, those stakes are useless, especially in sand. Of the 9 people I was camping with, everyone's tents blew away except mine and another. They were all staked in. What was the difference? I had a water cube in my tent.

 Do you fags really bring a hammer and nails into the woods?

i usualy go with the Nidrocohen Taurin 400 Stakes because they are durable and are made of high quality cobalt-nitrate so they never oxidise

Most tent stakes work really well for me. Keep in mind you don't really need to use that much force when pitching a tent unless you camp at some very exposed spot or you know its gonna be windy. The basic ones I got with my Hilleberg Enan have worked wonders.

What's up /out/
Oldfag here, not too common on /out/ but I always peek around for Commercial Fishing stuff to no avail. Was wondering if anyone else was in the industry? I've only been doing it for 2 years but christ did I get the itch. I make decent money, work with good friends and have such a great time Fishing. 

Started off Stone Crabbing in FL, now I am New England. Currently Gilnetting for Monk Fish, but worked off shore squidding and lobstering. 

If your interested in finding a non jewed job the best advice I have is join Commercial fishing jobs on jewbook, or hit your local Fishing dock and ask around. Everyone needs help, and if your under 40 and don't smoke Crack your in the top 1%.

Some of the offshore guys make easily 100k for the summer or whatever their season is. Going out tonight but will answer any questions.

If you like saying nigger and like the freedom to bring up questioning the holocaust, then Fishing is for you.

Heading out to AK in 2 days to set up for Bristol Bay gillnetting in June. Been working in processing for 2 years, spent last summer setnetting. First time on a boat, just hoping the price is better than last summer
--- 2573260
what work do you do on the boat?
--- 2573262
What’s the situation in the Carolinas or up in the mid Atlantic? I’m about to relocate back home to SC from the PNW. I work in resource management for the county and don’t mind the elements, also been on boats in the gulf with my family in Mississippi since I was a kid. The job I’m looking at will leave me long stretches in the summer and the winter. Any advice? Even just something seasonal to make a quick buck would be nice, our second we just had in March has health issues and the bills are starting to stack up.

>>2573236
That's awesome man. Gilnetting for what? It's the only fishery I have worked that really requires alot of skill. Just learning to get the fish out of the nets is a chore, were using 12 inch nets but getting some of these monk fish out is a chore and a half. We're headed out now, my captain is sick so my buddy is running the boat. This will be my second trip flaking. Do you have a discord? I'm thinking about going to AK next year or for the winter. 
>>2573260
Everything except drive. Depending on the fishery you have different positions, but most smaller boats with a good crew everyone switches positions to keep it fun and not be doing the same thing over and over.
Gilnetting sets a net that floats like a small tennis net on the bottom of the ocean. One side is weighted the other side with floats so it stands up on the bottom, anywhere from half a mile all the way to 5 miles. Anything that swims through Gets caught and you have to pull the fish out of the net. We kill alot of sharks sadly, seals sometimes, sharks, even a few dolphins on occasion. That's the way of the world tho. Alot of fisheries have alot of bycatch... it gets eaten in the ocean tho.

>>2573262
Hit the dock a few times, different times of day. Get some numbers, tell them your willing to learn. Alot of offshore shrimp boats out there can make good money. You go out for 5-30 days, don't come in until the boat is full so you always got a nice check.
Food is payed for, TV, some have internet. It's a great time. Best advice I can give you is shop around, it takes awhile to find a good boat. But once you find one there is nothing better. The brotherhood you experience fishing with your friends and making money is like no other. The boat I'm on is amazing, 4 of us including the captain we just smoke mad weed, jam out to satellite internet taking turns picking the station and bust our ass. It's the only job I've had where the hard work feels warranted, and you don't want to half ass.

Bristol Bay is nearly all sockeye salmon, with a few kings and chums. The boats are all length restricted to 32 feet, so living onboard isn't going to be fun. The share on a boat is a lot better than setnetting. Only made 4.5% share last summer, about 10k for 2 months. Bought some land out by Kenai with the money, going to slowly develop it as my base camp between seasons

>>2573231 (OP)
can a fat fatherless retard abandoned by even god make it into fishing?
what does it take?
I'm from Washington state
I've never actually been fishing before, but my life is shit I am on the brink of being homeless

>>2573282
Get into fish processing in Alaska, you get room and board taken care of and free flights from Seattle to the cannery.

Pay is generally $18 an hour, work is 12 hours a day 7 days a week so tons of overtime. If you get 12 hours of work every day you can make $5-6k a month. B season (salmon) you can come home with 10-15k. It's a good place ago start in the industry
--- 2573287
>>2573285
wtf I have to work 12 hours a day cutting up fish?
that sounds dreadful
--- 2573291
>>2573287
It's boring and repetitive, but easy work. The canneries are always hiring and will take just about anyone with a pulse who applies. A lot of people can't take it and quit, and they have to pay their own way home.
--- 2573293
>>2573291
yeah, I mean it sounds appealing in a lot of ways
except working 12 hours a day everyday cutting fish
plus I heard alaska is an expensive place to live
--- 2573295
>>2573293
The cannery provides room and food at no cost (some charge $15/day for everything) and pay to fly you back to Seattle if you complete the season so your costs are very low. There's plenty of videos on youtube with more in-depth info.
--- 2573301
>>2573295
Sounds fucking terrible
--- 2573305
>>2573301
Kind of.
Fishing isn't any easier, you're still working long hours every day with no days off when you're at sea
--- 2573361
Maybe after I catch some felony charges
--- 2573387
Do you need felonies? Meth/adderal addiction? Face/hand tattoos? I’m thinking about doing this, located in NC. Anything in the outer banks or should I be going south or north for more opportunities 
>>2573293
>>2573301
Fat pussy.
--- 2573601
>>2573387
Don't need any of them. I'm sober, my whole crew smokes alot of weed tho. You do want to make sure your on a good boat, there is alot of drug addicts in the mix. I do have a record and tattoos but that is irrelevant. 

There is a shrimp fleet and long liners in the NC area. Summer is really big for off shore squid boats (Trawlers), they make really good money. I would again look on jewbook.

Reach out, look at some of the people posting looking for jobs. Explain your new, looking to get involved.

Just got service back, boat is full maybe a 15 hour trip. Prolly made 1800$
--- 2573606
>>2573282
How fat? Alot of the guys out here are fat. It could give you a new Jumpstart on life. Take a trip out to the Seattle fishing docks and talk to people, look up Seattle commercial fishing groups. If you have the will to not become homeless I am sure you can do it.

>>2573361
People like this are retarded, if you have the willpower to buckle down and learn the trade, and not blow your money... its a great opportunity to become self sufficient. It's a young man's game, it's 80% old grumpy men who can hardly handle the labor any more, and are such assholes they can't find help. I have 5 friends in the area who are under 30, own their own boats, make 6 figures in 2-6 months and love their jobs. Work for themselves.

Good boats don't hire dope heads, people on the water also don't give a fuck about your background. But try fucking around with people off shore, ain't shit for someone to throw you over. Birds of a feather flock together, and good boats generally don't need help. Good boats keep solid crews. 

Love seeing people talk shit on other people, enjoy your wagie check and living with your mom.

Congrats homie. Great info you’ve posted so far, maybe all the teenage daydreamers who flood this board will become hardened fishermen because of you. What’s the hazing going to be like for a greenhorn? How wet and miserable are you on the boat?
--- 2573940
>>2573273
How much land did you get and what's your plan for it? How easy to get supplies and equipment in to build?
--- 2573941
>>2573301
It's probably better than say construction tho imo.
--- 2573943
>>2573601
What's the ppl situation? Is everyone mostly cool or is it convicts stabbing each other with forks for a gram? I hear horror stories from ppl in construction regarding the drugs and being around idiot jock type morons.

I appreciate it man. I got into fishing from an ad on CL.. "250$ a Day Stone Crabbing" Was the hardest job I've ever had, 14 hour days 5 days a wdek... A captain came on the boat from NE to see the operation, said It's obvious I don't know what I'm doing but you're a hard worker. He said finish the season and I'll give you a job in New England. Long story short here I am.
Hunter Thompson has one of my favorite quotes
>Buy the Ticket... Take the Trip
The hazing isn't bad, people need good help these days, and for me it's still exciting, feels like an adventure and luckily for me the people I work with are younger. They do set you up for the laughs tho, a few weeks ago they sent an electric skate (stingray) down the table and I almost fell over when I grabbed him.

Wet and Miserable is only in the beginning. You spend good money on gear and it keeps you pretty dry. It's just when it starts getting some tear in it you'll get a little wet from the holes and honestly the worst part is you'll have your jacket on but you start sweating and getting hot from working. It's just now getting warm out enough that sometimes I take my jacket off and just rock the shirt and every hour or two I'll put on a clean set so I don't stay wet.

>>2573941
Depends, some construction is fun, again it's really about who you are working with. I built concrete pools for a long time and once I learned how to drive the excavator and skid steer it gets pretty easy you don't even break a sweat and you make really good f****** money. I think the fish factory would be a great plan for somebody to go save up 15 to 40 Grand and a couple months with everything paid for and then putting that money into starting a business.

80% of all fishermen I have met are cool. Laid back, hard working. It also depends on the type of boat your on; certainly a big drug problem in the industry. It's one of those jobs like construction where you can get high and do it, your 8 hours off shore. Alot of the guys are single, kinda lost in a way. The boats that stay out for weeks at a time, you come back in with 5-20grand and your mobile, it's easy to fall into the shit. I've been drinking much more since I started, recently have cut back.
My boat nobody drinks, just smoke alot of weed and dance/hang out while we pick fish. The camaraderie you experience with a good crew fishing is unlike anything else. It's not wage slaving, if you skip doing something then someone else has to do it for you. If you go out of your way to do something else you're doing something that now they don't have to do. If someone isn't carrying their weight it has to be held by the rest of the crew, but it also makes it very easy to work because you're not sitting there questioning why the f*** am I doing this like some b******* hourly job. Once you know what you're doing you get a full share which is a percentage of the catch. The boat I'm on currently never feels like work it just feels like I'm hanging out with my friends
--- 2574036
I'd love to get into it, just don't know how. I teach and have the summer off, always thought it would be a great way to make some extra change. I've lived on the water my whole life and I'm the first of the men in my line who didn't work in the maritime industry or go navy in literal centuries. I'm in north FL now (Jax) but I just don't know where to begin. My father in law was a commercial fisherman and everyone has all these amazing stories about him, but he died when my wife was a little girl (heart attack) and I never got to talk to him about it which kills me. 

Is it really as easy as just walking up to the docks and asking? How do I even find the right docks? I feel like everyone at the ones near me are boomer pleasure cruisers. Do fisherman use the same docks as everyone else or do they have specific locations for fishing vessels? I feel like it's painfully obvious to anybody how green and stupid I am. Are there any desirable skills I can work on besides not being a junky? I have a reputation as a good camp cook and I'm not bad with my knots, albeit I should probably refamiliarize myself with a few.

>>2573940
Got 4 acres, only half of which is useless swampland. Plan is to buy an RV and park it there, eventually get water and electric set up too. 

>>2574036
A lot of teachers work in the Alaskan salmon fishery, either as fishermen or processors. Salmon season generally runs from early-mid June to late July. I've posted a bit about processing, but getting a job on a boat is harder, as you have to contact the captain directly. Your best bet is probably looking at FB and Craigslist for captains in need of crew.

Cooking is a good skill to have on a boat. If you have a background in mechanics/electrics/welding, that would also be desirable.
--- 2574072
How much dead fish are you tossing off the back of the boat on an average day?
--- 2574090
>>2574072
This. how much free fish do you get to eat?
--- 2574094
>>2574036
There are state fishing piers, I would just Google fishing docks/piers in your area. I said it before Facebook groups. I'm sure a commercial fishing Jax google search would yield results.

It is that easy sounding, but you also need to be persistent because the boats that are out and not at the dock are the ones making money. But go down there, tell anyone at the dock your super interested in fishing open schedule, get some numbers give them your #. Because all the fishermen talk. The group on FB "Commercial Fishing Florida" will be your biggest lead. Alot of small towns within driving range too.

Not alot. Trawlers (Draggers) have alot of waste, we actually hit our limit (10,000lbs) of skate yesterday, and threw back about 3000lbs of them still alive. When we are gonna save them we smash them in the head with a mallet, it's very difficult to pull live ones from the net.
>>2574090
Anything I want to take home is not a problem, I miss lobstering. Was taking home 2-3 a day, selling alot for cash too.
--- 2574101
>>2574090
Out in Alaska last summer we got to eat fresh salmon literally every day in just about any way we could think of. Got 10 pounds of frozen portions sent to my home for free as well.

I tried to cook the starry flounder we caught a few times, but the flesh is too mushy and just dissolves when you take a bite. The rest of the time we just threw them back, they were easy to pick but liked to immediately swim back into the net.
--- 2574103
>>2574101
One of the many percs I'm staying in Connecticut right now and the river by the house is stocked with Atlantic salmon. So delicious
--- 2574108
>>2574103
We always picked out the king salmon to eat when we could because we got paid the same regardless of species. We tended to bake the salmon with a variety of glazes as it is the easiest way to feed the whole crew. Leftovers were turned into salmon salad. I only made one batch of smoked salmon because it takes so long to prep the fish and I have only so much time between tides. Turned out great though!
--- 2574124
>>2574108
Awesome man. Your the anon at the fish factory?
--- 2574131
>>2574124
Yep. Got started in processing right out of high school and have been doing it the past couple of years. Last summer setnetting was my fist time fishing. Heading out to AK right now to do some barge work, then spending salmon season driftnetting. I got no college debt and love my job and the flexibility it gives me.

More info? Cannery name/location?
--- 2574513
At what age do the fishermen become too old to do the work? I understand it's probably varies but just trying to get a gauge on how hard this type of labor is on the body. Do you think neet 4chan browsers would be able to do it without some sort of fitness prep?
--- 2574593
>>2574510
 Not him but I know you can go to Trident Seafood's careers page and look for openings. Not sure how they are compared to other canneries, but they're a huge company.
--- 2574597
>>2574094
Added.
>fishing open schedule
So what exactly would that schedule entail? Is it basically saying "hey give me a call if your crew is ever short"?
--- 2574884
>>2574513
Seconding this. The work is obviously demanding, but how would you even prepare physically? What muscles are you really using the most? I feel like it's a lot of legs, back, and shoulders. However, the mental strain of limited sleep and rough conditions might be more taxing than the physical strain of the fishing.
--- 2574966
I dont want to meme but if there was a copy paste post for commercial fishing this book would be recommended reading for BB.

TL;DR it's more of a gatekeep and bill Carter is dramatic at times, solid dude just dramatic with his descriptions. His stories about Serbia/Bosnia were pretty cool.
--- 2575528
>>2574966
Neat. Anybody else have book recs about fishing, fiction or nonfiction?
--- 2576530
>>2573231 (OP)
I got a job on Bristol bay from an online ad last summer because I heard it about it on this board and like boats. I quit when I found out the operation was a shitshow with the owner being a delinquent on pay and the other crew being tweakers I quit and long story short ended up setnetting in another part of AK but barely broke even. Met cool guys though and learned some good skills.

Im probably gonna go back up and be homeless up there this summer and try to network with some guys any info on Fall/Winter/Spring fisheries in Alaska or elsewhere.

Based unhoused adventurer seeking gainful employment. You should become a meth dealer and sell to boat crews onshore. Invest in a light water craft down the road so you can deliver to them on the job
--- 2576703
>>2574513
I'm not in great shape, if you start the job and are motivated within the first few weeks you will be able to work without getting sore. No different than starting a job in construction and getting put on hole digging duty. Alot of the guys I fish with are in their 50s, even 60s. Just gotta take care of yourself... also know alot in their 50s that are battered terribly. 

>>2574884
I said it in the beginning, you want to find a day boat first. Leave in the morning come home at the end of the day. Just like a 9-5, And certain fisheries require alot more physical labor.
Trawling or Dragging, where you tow a net behind the boat for 30m to 4 hours, you literally just pick fish off a conveyor belt or from a pile on the middle of the deck. 
Lobstering is more taxing, you have to lift the pots/stack them. But even then some smaller boats the traps are thin metal... go talk to some fishermen in your area, check out the boats. 

Good luck anons. Get out of your comfort zone, make a change. Don't psych yourself out, even worst case scenario you go out and it's too much; then try another type of fishing. Or another line of work... keep trying

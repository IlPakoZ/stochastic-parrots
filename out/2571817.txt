I went to a city park today and I actually couldn't find a single person not looking at their phone. Every person on the walkway was looking down on their phone, so bad that you had to dodge them (they would walk into you and then get indignant if you didn't). People with their kids on phones, people with their partners on phones, people with their dog leash in one hand and a phone in the other not paying attention to their dog who is poking their noses into other people, who aren't even paying attention because they're in their phones. People on picnic blankets on phones, people sitting in the seats reserved for the scenic reservoir view while looking down at their phones.
I felt so weird. This isn't one of those boomer posts but it's weird to think about people choosing to go into nature just to keep on their phone. I specifically want to look around and enjoy the day when I go out. Why do people even bother getting the fresh air if they're just in the same four apps all day?

You are correct but don't despair, just carry on as you are, being overly concerned of people's free time is pointless.

You don't need your eyes or thumbs to breathe. A lot of people just use the park for literal ventilation and to be physically away from people they live with.
Not that I like it, but that's how it is.

I miss the community of going to the park and getting to at least make eye contact and nod at someone. Part of the park is enjoying your surroundings but it's hard to enjoy the surroundings when everybody is an automaton. The people end up being pollution by being there.

I feel people are suffering at the moment, hopefully in the future we can make what you outlined reality once more.

Where was this?
I live in a pretty city and people here don't use their phone while walking.
I always assumed it was a meme or an "only in America" type thing.

I am reminded of an old song
>Don't you feel it growing, day by day
>People getting ready for the news
>Some are happy, some are sad
>Whoa, gotta let the music play
>What the people need is a way to make 'em smile

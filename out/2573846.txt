Australian outback general
This is a general for all australian related /out/ topics

To get you started in this vast country
>wikicamps
An app for campgrounds people have visited before.

>hiking trials 
Your best bet is just to find something that looks good along your travels and give it ago. Unlikely to be much info online if you're in the middle of nowhere.
Otherwise the national parks are okay.
No big mountains here, so prepare for longer hikes.

For me it's driving, find a short hike, keep driving, and find a spot to camp.

/out/ in aus is best done with 4wd, as the infrastructure sometimes doesn't exist.

Australian /out/ is very different from the us /out/ and deserves its own genny.

I read you guys hunt the wild boar out in the bush, it's an invasive species down here and is tearing up the environment and farms. If you have not watched Razorback (1984) I'd highly recommend it as an Australian movie.

>>2573850
Interesting
Yeah heard some stories about wild boars here.
They get massive and become more carnivorous the deeper you go into the desert
--- 2573855
Aussie thread? Fuck yeah. I won't dump pics but I'll drop a few. I spend a lot of time in the high country.

This is the top of Mount Terrible. I've done pretty much all the worst climbs, old zeka creek, billy goat bluff, the haunted stream, etc but the rock climb to get up Mount Terrible was the scariest my back wheels slipped into the ruts in the rock and the 4x4 was pointed right but I was climbing up while moving left.

This was taken on a random track near the Howitt High Planes. 1500m elevation. In 20 minutes it went from being a beautiful clear sky to this with marble sized hail stones.

Currently freezing my ass off somewhere 15km off the nullabor

Damn. It's too flat out there for me. I prefer the mountains of the great dividing range.

I'll check it out.
I'm making my way across to sydney solo
Work decided remote wasn't an option and also forced annual leave.
So why not

Camped in some interesting places so far and found a few great hikes.

It's definitely interesting out there I haven't spent a lot of time in the outback but I've done a bit. If you're going to be near Sydney you're closer to the blue mountains. Im guessing you've got a 4x4 right? If you've got one it's worth checking out. Imo it's the best /out/ part of Australia. One of the longest mountain ranges in the country. If you're into off trail hiking then the great dividing range is the ideal place to do it.

The country is full of pigs and goats. From the outback to the bush. Huge ones and goats. I almost crashed into a massive billy goat while driving through a cloud once.

Few pics from the last camp/hike I did with the wife in Northern NSW. Our favourite thing is remote hike-in camping but also have a capable 4wd so do a fair bit of beach camping and remote drive-in camping

Any chance you found the track in to the base of Wollomombi Falls? I get out that way a few times a year and have been looking for it for ages now
--- 2575013
>>2575008

Nah I'm not from the area, was just visiting some friends so we only went as far as the little water hole near the lookout. We're going to have a proper explore next time we're down there

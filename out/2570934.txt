Bugler hand rolls, so I have to really want a cigarette enough to roll one.

Camel. Roll my own. Shit habit tho, quit for 2 years...but not really since I'm back at it. 

Honestly thinking about switching to cigars or pipe tobacco for a while and keep it for 1 or 2 times a week, if I manage the cravings. 
Or back to the whole e-cig and nic gums until I'm able to not be an asshole to everyone else without nic. As I said, shit habit.
--- 2570952
Hm I only rolled one pouch, was shit at it. Now I have camel unfiltered.
--- 2570953
>>2570952
I like camel and I'm Fr*nch, but even for me unfiltered camel is too much
--- 2570956
TLDR: Dark blend in a soft pack.
Stopped 4 years ago but until then I liked whatever the froggies made with a dark tobacco like blue gauloises or Gitanes with a filter and prefereably in a soft pack. It always has that one extra cigarette when you thought it was empty.
But since its all either Altria/ Philip Morris or British American Tobacco over here the blends are pretty much the same no matter if its Luckies, Marlboro, Gauloises or whatever, the old brands died out about 5-10 years ago.
It's the occasional cigar or pipe 2-3 times a year now.

/out/ doesn’t have janitors. Moderation happens when something is flagged and a site-wide mod decides to do what’s he’s not being paid to do. 

Something like this slips below the radar because the mods simply don’t know any better. 
>we smoke outside huhuhu
Things being done outside are not the same thing as outdoor recreation, and it’s not gatekeeping to point out that threads about smoking belong on /b/. 

>I like to spend like outdoors
Cool, what do you like doing? Hiking, camping, maybe fishing? Plenty of people around here hunt. I used to kayak a lot. I saw a guy online who liked to climb trees, complete with climbing gear.

I don't smoke but I still think smokes are smart thing to take with you. Natives smoked, cowboys smoked, soldiers got smokes in their rations... it's just part of the deal. Keeps squitos under control for one thing

I used to do that shit in high school when we couldn’t escape to the sports teams locker room for a smoke. Great memories of doing bumps in the darkroom in photo class

I love NIL whites (classic old german brand)
Since we have these canceruos pictures pictures on them i always grab one with the smoking baby.
--- 2571988
>>2571572
I was in Germany for the first time a few months ago and picked out that exact pack to keep as a memento
--- 2572107
I use nicotine pouches, like dip but it's tobacco-free while still having a good kick to it. They get me through my days.

I also roll joints with weed/tobacco though with whichever rolling tobacco I've chosen. Drum blue, amber leaf, player's.
--- 2572196
Camel Blue Compact. I like the regular blues, but those have the faggy white filter, and 50% of smoking is to look cool. 

I use it to tell wind when hunting, also I light one up after a succesful shot just so the animal can die in peace. It's good to smoke while waiting, at least you have something to do.

I smoked for a looooooong time. Started with Camel Wides at 12, regular smoker at a half pack a day by 19, and finished with Spirits like so many others. I've had such a brutal relationship with cigarettes over the years, lots of my best friends smoke and many of the best memories were enjoyed with a cigarette in my hand but honest to god the health effects were just not fucking worth it.

I had quit for 4 years when I relapsed into nicotine addiction due to a super stressful dream job I got. Smoking was one of the few things that felt like calmed me down, and it suppressed my appetite which meant I was able to eat fewer lunches and get more work in... I thought that was a win-win for a long time hahaha.

Anyway, did that for just 2 months and it was like those 4 years off never even happened, I felt the itch so bad again and was totally hooked. I needed to go through the whole withdrawal process again, kicked it off with a big send-off solo backpacking trip in '21 where I just went fishing lakes for 25 miles as I dwindled down to my last fag. 

"End of the Line" I called it, and that was the last one I had. I still think about it all the time, how easy and comfy it would be to light up again on a cool fireside night, but I have to remind myself that I've got shit I wanna do with my life still and each cigarette robs me a little bit of that. Training for my first mountain marathon this August and I've never felt better in my life. It's really worth it to quit some time anon, I did it by reading Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Quit Smoking". Obviously if you love it, you love it and I don't fault ya for it, that shit is comfier than fucking anything, but once you live without it, it's like you unlock another level in life.
--- 2572421
I prefer lucky strikes myself. Something about it feels right, if not then camel wides or
Mavericks if I’m poor. I have a feeling like most on this board there will be a day where I leave the tobacco for good. Yet for now I’m glad I have it.
--- 2572442

That's actually sick. Do you treat it with anything ( like chemically) or do you smoke it pure ?
--- 2572648

i just press the leaves into slabs and cut them into strips that i dry and smoke with a pipe
really easy and cheap considering that 20 pack of smokes cost around 10 euros these days

I smoked a pack a day from about 18 to 30 and then mostly quit, I only smoke socially now and go through maybe a pack a month. Marlboro 27s are my usual choice but my favorite are really Mevius when I can get them, which has sadly gotten really hard in the last few years.

Take the pipe pill my friend. 
Inside a little while ago. Found a blend called Haunted Bookshop which ticked boxes for me. Also one called Peterson early morning pipe. 
With those 2 blends I'm all sorted.

I dont smoke often but my favorite cigarettes ive smoked are nats rich taste
--- 2573729
>>2570934 (OP)
I've only ever brought one pack, years back, and have never smoked a single fag of it..
I carry it everywhere and occasionally use an unlit cig.
It's a daily reminder of self restraint and my weakness.
I'll light one on my deathbed.
--- 2573737
>>2573695
That’s probably cause nats is made from cigar tobacco. It was made cause a customer of bat Sherman’s was upset he couldn’t smoke a cigar on a plane.
--- 2573753
>>2570934 (OP)
I like Marlboro Reds.
They taste nice and cost less than other brands.
I have American packs, cause the EU sucks ass
--- 2573765
>>2573753
I guess you are in the Eu thrn, where do you get ametjcan packs ? They look duch much better.
--- 2574214
I know they used to include cigarettes in old military rations. Would it be possible to store them indefinitely if you sealed them with one of those boveda humidor packs? Or conversely, to rehydrate an old dry pack using the same stuff?
--- 2574216
Sure do like giving a dollar tax every time I fuck my body up with cancer causing bullshit that would make anyone unaccustomed throw up. My favourite brand is fuck you but ill probably still buy your vape!
--- 2574223
You ever get the blocked nose and have a smoke, because why wouldn't you if you don't its bad news, and then you realize that all you can taste from it is ashtray
--- 2574227
>>2574214
Cigs were in rations because without them there, some of the grunts are going to go to any means to get one. They are going to scour the position. They are going to wander around like a goddamn retard and hassle someone who brought more, or could afford more, and then they are going to break it up and re roll it in a piece of newspaper. And then they are going to smoke that shit while sitting on the gun with everyone else asleep and get shot in the face. But damn when they spark it up, it's good for morale.
--- 2574258

Lambert and Butler Blue but I want to quit and i'm currently trying to cut back.
--- 2574284
Camel crush menthol. 
Its a treat to me.
If I do a good hike and walk up somewhere one of my favorite hilltop lookout spots, then I can smoke one cig and relax.
But otherwise I don't smoke alot. Maybe 6 cigarettes a week if that. A pack will last a month or more.

I enjoy smoking, but got shit genes for it. I've got no living males in my family past 52 years old. All who smoked, all got lung cancer or stroked out early. Mom used to smoke and got cancer + stroke too. My older and younger brother have both had minor strokes. Much as I'd like to, fuck it, seems a shitty way to go from what I've seen. I used to smoke fucking unfiltered pipe tobacco in rolling papers, cause one or two hits of that stuff would have me crusing fine. Headrush for days. That, and that Arabic stuff, dokha, I like that stuff a lot, seeing as you only need a pinkie-nail's amount in a fancy crack pipe to send yourself sailing. I still have at least a few ounces from the one bag of 35$ pipe tobacco I've bought, ever, and have been smoking from since I started dabbling close to a decade ago. Long and short, I'd love to, if it didn't have the track record it did in my family.
--- 2574379
only smoke brands like winston and american spirits, ingredients in cigarettes should be limited to tobacco and water. almost all commercial cigs have 100s of bullshit additives. youd have to be retarded to smoke them
--- 2574769
>>2574376
does your family eat a lot of fried food or foods cooked in sneed oils/margarine (including snacks)?

>>2574379
nats are also great but expensive (altho I think around the same price as spirits)
best option in terms of both quality and cost would prob be to buy a fine rolling tobacco and roll your own
--- 2575109
How do you carry your ciggies while /out/?
I have a brass tobacco case I really like, some repro of an early 1800s pipe tobaccy hinged deal; holds like 15 cigs.
Anybody have one of those HBC ones with the magnifying glass lighter in them?
--- 2576443

Don't smoke on the regular as £12 per pack is a fucking scam. I did get some Camel "premium quality 1913 blend" softpack fags from Poland and they are pretty tasty and for only 16 zloty. I occasionally use nicotine pouches but stopped vaping ages ago. Trying to lower my tolerence to nicotine so i can have the occasional cigarillo and not feel like i am dying of cancer or getting addicted.
--- 2576525
I don't smoke atm I used to smoke Winfield Blue, I'll start up again when cbd hemp ciggies come out here just for the taste.

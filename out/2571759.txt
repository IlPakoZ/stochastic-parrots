Grats I guess. You just joined the ranks of millions of rich tourists. And millions of enthusiasts too but just a little reality check I passed my padi open water in between binge drinking at an all inclusive resort 20 years ago. It's not graduating from Harvard. 

Have fun and don't fall for any upgrade licence unless you want to work underwater. The basic open water will let you dive recreationally everywhere.

Now get your advanced cert so you can do deep water diving. Don’t listen to this fag. >>2571870 Some of my favorite dives were down at 30m

Congrats anon! I remember when I got my PADI OW and I have never regretted it. I've had a passion for the underwater world ever since my youth and since finally becoming a scuba diver I can safely say it will be a lifelong pursuit of mine. If you're serious about this and plan to scuba dive the rest of your life, I would recommend piecing your kit together one bit at a time, starting with the regulators if you already have your own mask, snorkel, and fins. You can always rent BCD's and tanks, but in my opinion it's gross to rent something that 80 other people have put their mouth on. Plus you'll never feel cooler than having your own set of equipment to put together and maintain.

I visited the blue hole in Egypt when there happened to be an international free diving competition or something. Ended up talking to some of the best free divers in the world. The stories they told about people succumbing to the squeeze were horrifying, and I don’t wish that kind of retarded, excruciating death upon anyone

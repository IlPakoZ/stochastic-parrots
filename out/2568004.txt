looks like some variety of rubba.

overwater literally once and it's all gone. not just the plant but the soil too.

OH and also, don't feed it after midnight or you're fucked

Anon this looks identical to my elephant bush. Itâ€™s called Portulacaria afra. I have two outside that are green and orange. And three inside that I propagated from a mother plant. The indoor plant leaves are pale green. Water once a week , more if the soil is dry. If the leaves start to fall off put it on a windowsill

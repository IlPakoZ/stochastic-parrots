Imagine a hellish agricultural landscape, flat, not one tree in sight, minuscule allotments of land, many houses. How tf do you do it? Can we brainstorm a bit?

>>2566749 (OP)
get in a dumpster, burry yourself in the garbage, kill yourself, there's a good chance they will never find your body.
--- 2566753
Post up in the hedgerows, or dig down and hope it doesn't rain.
There's probably a market for low profile tents with realistic grassland camo. 
Dig, shore, and dewater. Might be able to keep the water out of your trench with a solar powered pump but I doubt it.

Op here, I need to backpack trough such a place soon, I have a tent. I don't know if you guys call it wild camping or free camping or whatever, I call it stealth because it is a densely populated, intensively farmed flat countryside. I can't imagine a spot where you're not in the eyesight of a house, passerby, car. I'm no rookie and I know that when the sun sets, these doubts usually resolve themselves and you pitch wherever, but maybe I'm not considering something that could make so anxious at this dreaded passage into this wasteland

Build a platform in those trees, and use lots of camo netting.

I'd look for a dark green or camo bivy and place it in the long grass.

Talking mainly bout a one night only situation, thanks for the suggestions anyway

I really mind damaging the field in this way, especially when all grown. I think the farmer might damage me next
--- 2566763

Keep it off to the side near a fenceline, you won't hurt anything that way.

If there's water ways, Kayak down the water ways and camp where it's good.

I'm not talking about Britain. Think more of something like certain parts of the Netherlands, or denmark or whatever... no hedges, no hills, you are in plain eyesight from paths houses roads for a mile

i have talked with few urban people during my time and they are all miserable pretty much
when they come to drink at my place they call it "the sticks" or this is "behind the god´s back" but what they are really saying i love it and let me live here forever because i hate it where i live

Why do you want to camp there in the first place?
--- 2566875
>>2566754
pitch a tarp. no fire bigger than your hand.
--- 2566877
>>2566772
I'm going to the Netherlands this summer, how hard is camping there?
--- 2566967
>>2566772

Surely there's some old trenches in Belgium to camp in.

it really doesn't. More like midwest USA or Netherlands or denmark. Only place in the UK that is like that description is the fens
--- 2567582
>>2566877
ask stepan snedzar or whatever he is called
dutch anon that used to shamelessly advertise his vids about camping in the netherlands on this board. 
The summary I understand is that if you are not near the coast and can access small islands or are not near the veluwe hills then its pretty difficult.

Looking at satellite views of the countryside horrifies me. Used to go camping all the times as a kid, forests were always magical to me, being immersed in the woods always felt like a true fantasy experience, boundless miles of untamed wilderness full of creatures and adventure. Fast forward a few decades, make the mistake of looking up all the old stomping grounds on google maps.. all just thin strips of trees, isolated, surrounded by thousands upon thousands of patchwork squares of farmland and highways.... I can't even
--- 2567691
>>2566749 (OP)
just get one of those teeny tiny backpacking tents and accept that you'll be sleeping in a drainage ditch or behind a large bush where if you have any artificial light sources you will be sniffed out and suspected of being up to no good because no sane man camps in the endless pesticide wasteland
--- 2567695
Set up camp in ditches, ravines and depressions when the weather allows. Even sparse tree cover and bushes will provide concealment from long distance observation if your camouflage matches the ground and you minimize movement.
--- 2567699
>>2566749 (OP)
I've done exactly what you're talking about in the great plains, US. It's not that hard, you need to be creative. 

Minimize footprint, bring maybe a sleeping bag and a tarp. 

Often times there are rows of trees separating property, or following streams which make good candidates. You'll obviously want to minimize your profile, and if you're on the move only move at night or in low light conditions. 

Sometimes you can get away with sleeping in the crops, such as getting in a furrow between corn rows. Look for structures that look relatively untraveled (Like a utility shed) and post up near that to hide your profile and hide in plain site.

I hate people who see agricultural fields and act like they´re nature. They´re not. They are industrial factories. They aren´t beautiful, or part of wildernis.
I fucking hate them.
>tHaTs WhErE YoUr FooD ComE fRom
Yeah, I wish it wouldn´t though. Fuck farming. Fuck the agrarian revolution. Fuck overpopulation.
Same goes for most forests. They´re not forests. They are manicured, industrialized tree factories. You might just as well stand in a steel mill.
God I hate the modern world.

you would be amazed how easy it is to not be see even in open fields. i just recently almost got stepped on by horse riders just because i was wearing a grey sweater and laying on a green blanket in the middle of a feild. this sort of shelter would work as long as you pick an appropriate camo pattern.
--- 2567854
>>2566754
bivy tent, camo net, shrubbery.
--- 2567857
>>2567854
feel like a camo net would stick out between the fields
probably get mistaken for someone illegally dumping their yard trimmings

Scotland is just gorse bushes, rocky climbs open fields and marshes. Wales has the most variety and the most eye catching views. England is 40% cordoned off dogshit and I am unironically ashamed to be English. May the queen ____ IN HELL.

England and Wales has the same as far as /out/ stuff goes. Out areas are more spread out in england, but also larger.
Your post makes me think you have never left your local area in england and been to one place in scotland and one place in wales (snowdonia)

That aside, if you can, you should try get to Fort William at the end of the month, the Six Day Trials will be going on and when the bikes aren't giving the finger to the laws of physics they do go through some absolutely lovely areas of scenery.
Also the bikes are a great show.

Camping is piss easy, if you know where. Best bet is near one of the rivers. Use Google earth to find a spot with no houses nearby. Be careful not to camp where wild cattle or horses roam, lest you wake up surrounded by them.

Pitch your tent/tarp after sunset, take it down before sunrise. Chill in the hedgerows when you're not hiking.
Vagrant Holiday has a great setup for stealthy urban camps, where he carries his bedroll disguised as a duffle bag and the rest of his kit sits in a daypack.
--- 2569056
>>2568983
>Pitch your tent/tarp after sunset, take it down before sunrise.
depending how long your setup/takedown is that could leave you as little as 5 hours sleep in the summer
--- 2570775
>>2566749 (OP)
If it's agricultural, camp between rows of crops. I assume you're sticking to roads, because farmers aren't going to find you on the back 40. Their dogs would be a bigger problem, but that happens on the road too. Corn and hay will hide everything in the summer. Hide under a bridge otherwise.

Also this old poacher will tell you how to remain hidden on the cheap. https://www.youtube.com/@blackoracle69
--- 2571008
>>2569056
Well then take it down when you wake up in the morning. Most farmers are probably not going to be out at first light - I'm sure some are, but it'll give you a bit of time.

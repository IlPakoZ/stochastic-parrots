I have an opportunity to move to Roanoke, VA for work. Has anyone lived there or visited? What are the pros and cons?

Visited a few times when I lived in VA. Excellent mtb and hiking opportunities, low cost of living. Cons, itâ€™s Appalachia so quite poor and uncultured.

Roanoke, Virginia is different from Roanoke, North Carolina. Also, first is pronounced row-NOKE, while the second is said row-UH-noke.

The Roanoke in NC is actually a wilderness zone , might be cool to check out a ghost forest

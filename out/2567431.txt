anyone else here going /out/ in places discovered with google earth? I haven't been anywhere else for years except for very minor excursions
it's the best tool by far to find unspoiled places far from any human disturbance including trails, incredible results even in western Europe. It's the last frontier
--- 2567433
I've recently been in this place in Switzerland and it was amazing. there's no trail leading there, you have to fully rely on satellite maps and the swiss topographic map
--- 2567435
another place under my radar is now Corsica. those rocky outcrops seem doable and they are surrounded by and endless pine forest
obviously, there's no trail anywhere nearby which is a good thing

I use Earth as my primary research tool.

Google Earth/Map is pretty much a nobrainer for scouting hunting locations.
Theres no tourist guide telling me specifically where ill find animals in a forest. I look at maps and satellite images to spot the waterholes as an entry point. Works like a charm.

Yes it's my main tool for adventure hunting. Normally you can see water and major obstacles pretty well so you can at least have an idea of what you're up against.

>there's no trail nearby
>image clearly shows a trail

This is what passes for "wilderness exploration" in a euroids mind
--- 2567517
>>2567472
that's the arrival point. there's no trail below and at the outcrops
obviously in europe there aren't miles and miles without a trail, but there are still small wild corners like that and GE is the perfect way to find them

What are your personal criteria for finding these places?

I like looking along abandoned rail lines, keeping away from populated areas
--- 2567552
Little tip for you lads, look at historic maps. You can find old trails, buildings, mines, quarries etc. Especially good for finding artefacts.
--- 2567659
>>2567535
i usually look for steepness, rocky outcrops, panoramic points, dense forest coverage and maximum distance from trails/roads/any obvious artificial disturbance
or anything that catches my eyes really

pic related is the high valley of the Scrivia river, one of my recent and best hikes. try to find a good area

It just makes me incredibly depressed and anxious to see how little forest land there is left in Germany.

Thanks, here in my part of the UK I have access to maps from as far back as 1612, and they can tell me a lot about the surrounding area.

My property is on top of an old farm that was there for over 250 years until it was sold and demolished. I located the place where the old well was on the maps and found it in the woods nearby. The well had been filled in with debris and refuse, and I asked permission from the local council to excavate it.

I found hundreds of animal bones, three intact clay pipes and a couple of dozen coins.

Use your maps people

I use the Ontario Crown Land Use Policy Map. It has way better satellite images and tells me where all the public/private land is and what I'm legally allowed to do on it. 

Invaluable for hunting and planning crown land camping/canoe trips. You don't get enough info from Google maps' low res satellite images. It's good for figuring out how to get there though.

I found a long-abandoned Forest Service road to connect to much longer trails. It was behind a church parking lot, and the first 50’ or so of the old FS road was gone, overtaken by the forest. If you were at the church, you wouldn’t know it was there. The latest map that showed it was from the 1950’s or 60’s, but if you look on google earth you start to see fragments of the road, dotted among the trees. The road passes through some clearings, and is gravel in some spots.

you go have fun hunting where you're not supposed to. Don't come crying here when you end up in prison.

You did see that I mentioned hunting in my post, correct? If you're incapable of following a a simple line of reasoning then please refrain from replying to my posts.

True. People who don't go /out/ don't have to worry about /out/ laws.

Seaman range was a nice hike up, nice ponderosa trees on top and a nice name, had to climb the semen range

that doesn't happen if you go offtrail though
--- 2568326

people that not only go /out/, but also know how to use google earth to see how much more there is besides trails, know that nobody goes off trail and there's nobody off-trail
--- 2568412
>>2568326
I use satellite maps to find old logging roads and ATV trails to hike along which sometimes lead to good camping spots. You do occasionally bump into other people on those.
--- 2568420
>>2568031

Fantastic. I use a website called Mapspast in NZ, which has the topo maps through the years and older maps all lined up with satellite photos too so you can really pinpoint things. Not that we have terribly old maps but a lot of disused trails and old hut sites. Going to check out an old cattle track near me at some stage soon.
--- 2568428
Sort of relevant and I don't want to make a new thread: How do I use Google Maps to identify the best places to hunt? What key features of the land should I be looking for? Ideally for whitetail.

German forests aren´t that big. And there´s so many trails going through them, that you can´t really go that deep offtrail. 
Germans are also bitter little rats, that see it as their personal duty to report anything even remotely out of the ordinary to the authorities.
Germans are basically living breathing CCTV cameras.
I mean, the chances are still slim, but if you do it every weekend, you WILL get caught eventually.
--- 2568919

>>2568324
for example, here´s a "forest" near where I live. See those trails carved through the forest? It´s impossible to go "Innawoods" in most forests in Germany.
--- 2568921
all the time, recently ive been scouting this area where someone from an airplane spotted an unnamed 200ft waterfall on an also unnamed creek. i've snowshoed the area a couple times this winter to get ready for when everything melts and i've got a general idea of where i should go. this area is a massive burn scar from a fire that happened about 15 years ago.

>>2568428

I look for grass and slips. Water. Places that are interesting to hunt are my favorite but if you're after practicality and guaranteed success then places near private farm land where the game can feed on the grass are always gonna hold lots of animals.
--- 2568944
>>2568919
bruh that's basically an urban park
try with a hilly/mountainous area
--- 2568948
>>2568919
i researched that (terrible) area for about 20 seconds and i've already found a semi-wild area
this really nice stream confluence is hundreds of meters away from the trails and nobody goes off-trail, i'm pretty sure you could camp behind that confluence for days without encountering anyone

to me for example Thüringer Wald and Pfälzer Wald seem pretty interesting as wildcamping in the woods is not strictly forbidden in these federal states. I do not live close to them but they look more interesting than the Sa

I do not live close to them but they look more interesting than the Sauerland. and should be reachable with the nationwide train ticket coming soon.

Kind of unrelated but I like to use that historic aerials website. I think it's potato cool to see how cities have been built up over the years.

That's also a really good resource

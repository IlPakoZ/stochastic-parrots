Definitely not a meme. Me and the boys all have one we take when we do multi day float trips. I have a katydan, one has a platypus, another uses a sawyer. Convenient as fuck you just fill them up and hang them on a tree. Packs down fairly small. They all work about the same. If you're using just one for a big group you'll want something bigger like a 10L. Ours are all 3-4L and typically get filled twice a dayish. Can't speak to the uv ones, I've always been leary of them and haven't tried it.

Dude don't feel bad you can't afford all this shit people say you need. I never spend a fuck ton of money on gear. Most of my hiking bags are used army bags from army/navy stores or something I've found at goodwill. I don't spend long 7 nights camping in but i frequent isolated places. You can find good shit that's cheap if you look hard enough. Also, get in google maps and find places no one goes close to your home. You will be amazed at what you find. I dunno just my thoughts.

What's wrong with life straws? Do they not properly filter water?
--- 2555851
>>2555840
They won't filter viruses (but that's only a concern in developing countries, especially crowded campsites and potential shtf/natural disaster scenarios). I've always just thought they looked awkward though, either you're filling your water bottle with dirty water or, what, sticking your head down to the puddle to suck away?
--- 2555855
>>2555851
Nothing can filter viruses. Come on I've looked into enough of then to work this out. Unless you're going for that sawyer bottle squeeze thing which is a filter mixed with an iodine tablet in the form of foam then you're bullshitting. That sawyer thing with foam is the only thing on the market that can remove viruses.
--- 2555863

>>2555855
Do viruses survive in bodies of water in a concentration high enough to reasonably contract? Most of the waterborne diseases I can think of such as Cholera and Giardia are bacteria instead of viruses. Also, do viruses not die after a relatively short period of being outside the body?

--- 2556437
What type of water purification tablets do I need btw? I need those that basically act as a LifeStraw.
There´s those that only keep already clean water fresh for a longer time, by stopping bacterial growth inside an RV water tank for example, but I need those that you put in dirty, shady water, you can´t trust to begin with?
All I can find are those that advertise as keeping already clear water clean for a longer duration.

I use the MSR guardian and fill a bag. Most of the water around here is pretty clean, so you can just drink out of the source.
--- 2556516
>>2555863
>Do viruses survive in bodies of water in a concentration high enough to reasonably contract?
Yes. It's a major problem around the world, not so much in the West but on a global scale the death toll from waterborne viral infections is well into the millions. 
>Also, do viruses not die after a relatively short period of being outside the body?
Not necessarily. Like the other anon said, it depends on the virus but rotavirus for example (one of the leading causes of diarrhoeal illnesses worldwide and responsible for half a million deaths/year) can survive in cold water or on dry, smooth surfaces for months (although closer to days in warm water or surfaces exposed to good sun). The same goes for a range of other viruses.

Aren’t those diseases spread via fecal matter in places with high population densities and substandard municipal water infrastructure?
--- 2556588
>>2556560
>Aren’t those diseases spread via fecal matter
They enter the water system via faecal matter but that doesn't mean you're safe so long as you don't start chowing down on floating turds, turbulence will spread them throughout the area and theyre perfectly capable of surviving as free-floating virions. A water filter won't protect you from viral illness just because it filters out faecal material.
Oh and theoretically urine, respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids could contaminate the water supply but in practice they tend to be fairly insignificant. 
>In places with high population densities and substandard municipal water infrastructure?
Yes, like I said "only a concern in developing countries, especially crowded campsites and potential shtf/natural disaster scenarios"
Viral contamination of water sources became a serious problem with all the idiots flocking to national parks during the pandemic. Literally shitting the place up.

Wouldn´t it set free toxic gasses?
--- 2558605

If there's such beings in the water it might be a good idea to filter + UV pen it.
--- 2558627
>>2558592
You’ll have sand in your water and will have to wait for it to cool because you chose to build a survivalist LARP water filter instead of buying one for $25 at Walmart but yeah, it will most likely be safe to drink after boiling. Boiling is probably the safest option.
--- 2558641
>>2558592
If you're going to boil your water then you can skip filtering it completely and still be fine >99% of the time. Maybe filter it through sand or even just a bandanna if it's murky but don't worry about viruses, bacteria or protozoa - boiling will kill all of them just fine. Make sure you boil it for long enough though. 

Still, I wouldn't call boiling the simplest solution. It takes time and effort to build a fire. Sounds like a real hassle if you're going to be on the move all day and want to take advantage of water sources as you pass by. 

>>2558602

I was a bit surprised when I got my Aquamira and it talked about RV water supplies on the label. It’s Chlorine Dioxide so it’ll kill everything in the water. You just have to wait a bit. It’s not too expensive. Like $15 for enough to treat 30 gallons. You’ll want to pre filter the water first. It’ll purify the sediment but you don’t want to be drinking gritty water. Alternatively you could get disinfecting bleach and add it to suspect water. Although I doubt it would taste as good.

It’s typical marketing, Anon. We were told by the people selling water filters that we would get sick and possibly die without it.

>>2561051
It’s something like that. It’s like 30 minutes for stuff like bacteria. Filters are really the best bet for stuff like Giarda and crypto. If you filter and chemically treat you’ll be extra good. Filters aren’t that expensive. It’s like $30 for a sawyer or Katydyn. I think they fit on smart water bottles. Many soft water bladders fit them. Katydyn sells a kit with filter and bladder for various prices. As does Sawyer. 
If you don’t treat your water and get sick you’ll wish you spent the money when you’re shitting yourself inside out.

Honestly though, just because you drink a cyst doesn't mean you're guaranteed to develop an infection. And if you do develop symptoms it's usually just diarrhoea and abdo pain.
If you're willing to roll the dice then so be it. Unless you have kids, there's a small chance of developing chronic giardia infection which, if not recognised, cab cause growth restriction and shit.

has some1 told you that you can leave all the cleaning kit stuff at home and bring a smartwater sports cap instead? its the perfect size to use to clean out a sawyer.

main reason people use it is because the sawyer has no aquamira tablet water taste.
and because chemical/mechanical filtration isn't the same. one might be better or worse for the water in your area. sometimes you want to do both. depends what's in it.

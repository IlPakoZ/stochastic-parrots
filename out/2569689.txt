Hey /out/ I've decided to touch grass for the first time and am looking for books to make sure I don't die. Is there a complete book set or list containing all the knowledge needed to survive for a couple weeks in the wilderness?

Nobody reads books anymore. Why do you want a book? You don't need a book to survive a walk in the park anyway. Just bring a Starbuck's coffee and your iphone. Ariana Afghan Kebob is like 5 blocks from the southwest corner of Central Park, you can grab lunch there.

The Qur'an if you really need to read a book in Central Park.

I didn't think people would take my first sentence so seriously. I decided to say fuck off to working and start maximizing my true potential by becoming homeless.

I'm looking for books because it's easier on my phones battery then video. I can keep a phone charged for weeks while reading several hours a day.

>>2569747
Well not weeks, but a week to a week and a half easy.

>>2569747
Oh, gotcha. I'd say you're on the right track, and I applaud you for thinking this through, especially with phone batteries. I know homeless shelters are an excellent place to find safe sex and intravenous drug use pamphlets. That's what I usually read.

Yeah I don't want to go anywhere near those places. I'm a hippy so don't mind sleeping in the woods, just want to go from kind of out doorsy to survival master

>>2569696
There is a thread specifically for /out/ books you useless oxygen thief

Just checked again, nothing in the catalog. Go search yourself you cum sucking tranny.

Bumping because there is still no book general up regardless of what this faggot says.

The best book is Into the Wild, with the caveat that you read between the lines. Jon Krakauer included many references to his gay lifestyle if you look for them. Another good one is Naked Places: A Guide for Gay Men to Nude Recreation and Travel. This book has a whole chapter on hiking and swimming while wearing a buttplug. Did you know that you can save the semen in your ass with a buttplug, and then release it into a river later? It's called "spawning" if you do it upstream of other swimmers.

Thanks a lot anon! I already got all the gay sex branch of survival skills down perfectly though.

Completely impossible. Without proper batoning skills and 10k worth of ultralight gear, you'll die the moment you set foot into a forest.

Does anyone know where can I download this book? I searched fucking everywhere.

Ah, I guess I am the useless nigger here. Sorry about that anon, though in my defense, I did check the catalog before making the thread. Just didn't think to search for lit. Thanks for the help you wonderful bastard

Dude. It's grass. You go outside, take your shoes off and step on it. If you wanna go extra hippie you lie down and hug the earth. Grass isn't going to kill you. Nothing in the grass is going to kill you. Go touch the grass. Just fucking go outside and touch the grass. You don't need to CONNNNSSOOOOOOOM. You just need to fucking go the fuck outside and fucking touch the fucking grass.

Every day when I get home I take my boots off and use a soft-ish brush to get the mud off them, and then I insert boot driers. Once a week I thoroughly clean them and apply leather treatment. I added up the time this takes over a year and it comes out to 19 hours per year.

go to a furnished campground, eat burnt hot dogs, and sleep in a shitty sleeping bag in a shitty tent. you will figure out what you wish you had - big bites, sunburn, too hot, too cold, forgot a chair, forgot a hat, etc. repeat. then you can do some day hiking. then you can do some through hiking. you don't need a book on safety. literally don't take risks. you're not going to climb a mountain, you're not going to rappel down a waterfall, you're not going to fight a grizzly in the yukon.

Is all beer from Four Peaks Brewing (Tempe, AZ) absolute shit, or just Joy Bus Wheat? I mean, wheat beers can have that puke taste but Joy Bus tastes like it literally has vomit in it.

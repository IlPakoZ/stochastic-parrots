I've noticed a massive increase in "community CCTV cameras" in my town. Obviously, I don't want to be watched on the trails.
What is the best method of spotting these in the dark - some sort of scope?

Don't go to England; during Thatcher's reign (at the height of Sinn Fein's terror campaign) the government installed tens of thousands of CCTV cameras in the woods. The camera coverage was designed to allow police to view any rural area with no more than fifteen meter gaps between camera views. This vast network of cameras is continually being expanded and updated with new technology.

I'm not being schizo. There are signs, specifically, put up to deter poachers.

There are ways to use a cell phone to detect infrared waves, which most cameras use. Search youtube or google it.
--- 2565419
>>2565377 (OP)
use another camera or nightvision to spot them, any camera should see them as a light that doesnt show up to your eyes
--- 2565427
>>2565377 (OP)
an IR camera (even just a handycam with a night vision mode) will expose the lens very easily, they also sell little handheld dealies that people use to scope out their hotel rooms and airbnbs and suchnot

I use a Bushnell night vision scope, any tiny cameras hidden in the trees etc will glisten and shine like a star when flashed with an IR beam

nægrœ it would be nearly impossible to steadily aim a laser directly into a camera aperture even from like 2m away, nevermind doing this from an actual distance. snot gonna happen

The only place where these cameras should be are at trailheads to deter all the vehicle break-ins that have been happening lately

They downed a drone in some protests in Argentina a few years ago with lasers. It can be done.
--- 2565558

well yeah if you have a tripod and scope setup sure. not if you're shooting from the hip while you're /out/ hiking
>t. had a neighbour with a rooster and bought my superlaser specifically to attack it when it would scream and crow right outside my window evey morning, had very few moments of direct laser-retina contact

One of my neighbors is an uptight city lib who hates the very notion of people being near his property. He set up trail cams pointing everywhere, including a public walking trail. 

One day me and my buddies got super drunk and somehow the topic of one of mynbuddies cosplays comes up. He has a film accurate Chewbaka costume. We always joke it looks like bigfoot. Then we get the idea to fuck with my neighbor. Buddy dawns the suit and he starts strutting past various camara from about 50 yards away. He stays far enough away that the camera picks up definitely something ape like and hairy but not much else. After having a few laughs we forget about my neighbor until he confronted me 2 days later and showed me how he caught fucking bigfoot on his camaras.

To this day still believes he captured bigfoot. Kek every goddamn time he brings it up even a damn decade later. Still funny.

Where did this happen? My dad spent months obsessing over how he found bigfoot on a trail cam he had set up around his house in a suburb in Florida. He kept trying to "submit the photos for academic study".

An actual IR camera would work fine because it emits an actual IR beam and that's what makes the lens glisten. Check yousetube you can find some demos. I have a little hidden camera that I tested this with and works a charm

>How powerful does it need to be?
no idea. I think a $50 one should be enough. I´d go for like 300-500mw. The stronger the better obviously. They aren´t that expensive. And they´re fun. And you can do some nasty shit with them, like blind cops at protests and other fun activities.

when I spot them before they spot me, I put one leg over the camera so it is between my legs, and then slowly lower my balls in front of the lens, and swing them back and forth. I have probably done this a couple hundred times over the years
--- 2566461

You have undiagnosed ADHD if you cant aim something steady without a tripod for atleast a few seconds at a time. Get some help and you'll realize how easy it is to keep your hands steady for normal people.

Thinking there are cameras out deep in the woods recording you is literally paranoid schizophrenia. The only actual cameras on public trails are at the entrance or exit to gauge how much use the trail gets by the public so the local government can decide if they want to put more funding into them, and all the one's I've seen are at knee height.
--- 2566905
>>2566903
Not any of those anons, but it's pretty common for trail cams to be placed in trails where bucks and deer occasionally roam to note how their migration pattern is changing this year to buy space in the private hunting zones that usually surround most natural reserves with game. A wealthy city boomer will pay top dollar to hunt in a target rich area and since you cant force the game to stay in a single place, it has become a big part of the business to set up feeders and in some cases artificially creating pressure by hunters hiking in a certain spot to make the deer favor the direction to their land over the others.

I'm in South East England, we don't have deep forests. I've found two of the cameras so far, got one with a rock and not sure about the other.
The cameras are meant to deter people from "poaching" fish
--- 2567187
>>2565402
I have never found any cameras in the woods or any infrastructure that would facilitate them. 
That being said, I live in wales, but the implication of your post is that they would have been placed all over the UK

if that is the case they would only be around angling clubs. They don't give a shit about just general rivers.

the same way robber's detect them: use a weak light and look for small dots that reflect the light. obviously you can only do this in low light/in the dark

I put cameras out all the time. I put this one on sort of a game trail off a main trail, people use it though. This was a 3:00am and was weird someone was out there. I was actually looking to get pics of deer/bear/wolf.

I talked to a cop while we were bringing clothing to a naked man in the woods. It's a funny story but the reason the cops knew there was a naked dude is because of the CCTV network in the woods. I researched the matter further and confirmed it. This program was so well known in the late 80s and early 90s that there is no shortage of information on it. The fact that there are UK /out/ists who are completely unaware of it baffles the mind.

You fucking dolt, a cop telling me he knows there's a naked man in the woods because of the CCTV is a fucking source. Like I said, if you get off your ass and research it you'll find plenty of articles.

Something like this. If you can see IR somehow, it’s super easy to spot those cams when they click on.
--- 2571540
>>2571415
The good thing about a proper IR camera is twofold.

For one, it has an IR spotlight which exposes spectral reflections immediately, so you can see any glass, reflectors, or lenses glowing in the light which you would never see with the naked eye. And second as you say is they will plainly see the spotlights of any triggered IR or trail cameras

I've done my fair share of peak bagging and have seen some good electrical storms but I've never been hit by lightning and I don't know anybody who has. Getting hit by lightning is so rare that it's used to describe an extremely rare occurrence such as a deadly bear attack. So what's all the fearful talk about? Seems to me it's just another thing that "experienced" outdoorsmen use to scare the newfags. Sorry folks, I don't pack my fears.

What fearful talk? Are you sure this isn't something you're imagining?
I've met exactly one person in my life who worried about the risk of getting struck by lightning and he had the bad luck to have already been struck twice so I figure he's allowed to be paranoid about lightning being out to get him. Apart from him - nada.

Imagine the feeling, the most powerful force of electricity chose you as it's vessel towards the earth. For that moment you are the most important thing all around. Then you're dead.

Lol. depends on where. I have been around enough close lightening strikes that blew up trees very near me to understand it is an actual risk. I have also been on top of OP's pic related and found out why its called that. But I also carry bear spray for the way down too...

I've never met a single person afraid of being struck by lightning. I've met people that find it startling, but they're not afraid of being struck by it.

who talking about it? It is a risk albeit small one. Just like a bear attack. But it does happen.

Been chased off towers by lightning storms a few times.

Fucking terrifying when you see corona discharge arcs between ladder and tower, hear the air crackling and popping.

Replaced a lot of blow'd up radios, cameras, PA's, polyphasers, transtectors.

I've been within 100-200 yards or so of a cloud to ground strike. If you aren't afraid of being struck after that, you simply don't fear death.

I've had lightning strike a small tree a few feet away from me, but I'm still not concerned. Also, if you survive a lightning strike, the scar looks pretty fucking sick.

It is not rare, you must also know how to "read" the weather, clouds tell you a lot about it, being at high altitude and near cumulonimbus type of clouds its very dangerous.

Thank you. I'll heed your advice as I sign summit registers this summer.

I stayed at this lookout during a lighting storm. Thankfully it had a rod attached to it. Was a pretty kino experience honestly.

Lightning is not a risk if you aren't doing things that increase your odds of getting hit, but you can make your odds quite high if you want to or are stupid enough to not understand.
Yeah they're literally one in a million in a broad view, but if you narrow your scope to "odds of getting hit by lightning during a thunderstorm while standing on high ground holding a metal pole above your head" it becomes quite likely, and quoting statistics at nature won't save you. If you want your odds to be the same as the average you can't do things that increase your risks, so being cautious about lightning is a good idea anyway.
Shark attacks are also very rare, even less common than lightning strikes if I'm seeing accurate numbers, but you still clear out of the water when one comes around.

When people get hit by lightning it leaves them with interesting scars, like pic.

I want to be struck by lightning on a hike and be completely incinerated.

just double checked and theyve closed it for renovations this season... again. ill have to plan something else out i guess lol.

Damn, too bad. Was also going to mention there's huckleberry bushes all along the trail up there.

Probably not the worst way to go honestly

thanks anon. i live a few hours north so i got my not-so-secret huck spot, this year im going to try and get a bunch of bilberries but they are really tricky to pick a lot of.

I was on Tiger Mountain near the top today approaching a clear cut and some tall radio towers while it was snowing hard. Hadn't heard any thunder at all. All of a sudden maybe 100 ft. up I saw the lighting strike. It was incredible.

I got struck once during a tornado when I was 16 and then many years later, in a completely different c'untry, I almost got struck twice in the same storm (lightning struck the ground near me twice while I was making for shelter).

Fuck that shit, I don't go out when the skies are dark. Or when there's a chance of a freak lightning strike even before the storm hits.
--- 2568806
I was on a laptop that was plugged into a charger during a storm
Lightning hit the pole, went through the laptop and shocked me
It was small like a static shock but I saw it arc from the speaker holes into my finger
--- 2568854
>>2568783
Cool. I experienced a snow and lightning storm once too, pretty bizarre.
--- 2569026
>>2568806
Did it damage the laptop?
--- 2569028
>>2568784
Any neurological problems afterward?
--- 2569212
>>2568854
Thundersnow is awesome. I wish it happened more often around here. I've been in one legit snowstorm where there was thunder for almost an hour and the sound was muffled because it was snowing so hard.

Well the bottom of my foot was burned and I swore that I was slow and lumbering for a few weeks but could have been my imagination.

I was huddled in the basement while all hell was breaking loose, and the house got struck right in the electrical conduit (which I was crouched right next to). Luckily the lightning destroyed every electronic device in the house on its way down. The washer, the dryer, the TVs, the computers, the fridge, the dishwasher, the refrigerators, 3 air conditioners, etc. Had the lightning not been buffered I would probably have died. All I remember is a flash like a shotgun blew off right in my face. My brother said a bolt of electricity arced out of the circuit board and hit me in the leg. I flew about 5 feet and all the skin on the sole of my foot was blistered. Good times.

It's the same unreasonable fear antigun people have about guns. Unless you're doing something stupid to put yourself in danger, the chances of you getting hit are miniscule...by lightning or a bullet.

like ringing the wrong doorbell? Driving up the wrong driveway? letting a ball roll into your nieghbors yard? getting in the wrong car by accident? lol

All the old people who i knew 20 years ago in their 80s 90s, they all genuinely feared lightning like hell. The atmoshpere was probably a lot more active in the past century. When was the last time you've seen st. Elmo fire?
--- 2571551

Yes, you can get struck by lightning doing all those things. If you're black, CNN will even accuse the lightning of being a far right extremist.

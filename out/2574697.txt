Any bowhunter anons here?
I'm considering picking up this hobby, i don't know why exactly, but it makes a lot more sense to me than hunting with rifles. Something about peace, silence, having to stalk the game much closer, etc.
What experience would pass on to a rookie? What did you learn in the first year? What essentials do you recommend to know first?
I'm pretty skilled with the bow myself, but i only ever shot reflex. I know i'd need a good compound for hunting so any tips about choosing the right bow would also be helpful.

As an experienced bow shooter what are your thoughts on hybrid recurve/compound bows such as the oneida?

No idea.
Again, I've been only in traditional archery, which is the most popular and kind of segregated part of archery here in Hungary. 
Many people a traditional Hungarian reflex at home, its fun and requires lot of skill and strength.
But these people generally like it for tradition, not because of the sport, so there's limited overlap between this and the other niches.
I've shot like two dozen of these traditional ones, but never even seen a compound/hybrid up close. 
That's also why im so interested. They are fucking expensive so i wanna know what to look out for before i make a choice.

These are the most common type here, usually 30 to 70 pounds, but they can go up to a 100 pounds too, very rarely above

Are there rabbits in Hungary? You could easily hunt rabbits since you're an experienced shooter but with deer you need to learn stalking.

There's way more pheasant, but there's enough rabbit as well. 
Although i want to work my way up to big game like deer and boar.

What sort of game can a 35# horse bow take?

I've been bow hunting (longbow) for one year, and I haven't yet had a successful hunt. Here's what I learned as a complete noob (and still a noob) after trying for turkey and squirrel a half a dozen times:
>1. try to scout locations beforehand to get a feel for its environment and what type of game might live there. Satellite images are very useful in that regard.
>2. Know how to navigate with both your phone and a compass/map. Always bring a map as a backup. 
>3. when turkey hunting, have your bow ready to shoot at all times. if you see a turkey and need to lean over and reach for your bow, it's probably going to see your movement and run. Turkeys have very good vision.
>4. for turkey and deer/moose, camo and scent control are much more important than with rifle hunting, because you generally need to be a lot closer to the target before you get your shot off. 
>5. squirrels are a lot harder to hit than they seem, at least with a trad bow. Also forest squirrels are a lot more evasive than city/park ones. 
>6. even if you don't get a kill, it's still usually a good time just to be out there in nature, silent, still, listening and looking, learning how animals behave and how to find signs of them, exploring off-trail in complete isolation, going places you wouldn't have gone if you were just hiking or camping. I suppose that's not specific to archery. But just remember that even a failed hunt is still a successful /out/ing.

35 is fine for any small game. 40 is about the minimum for deer/turkey. You could probably kill a turkey with a 35 but I'd go 40+ just to be safe. Nothing worse than hurting an animal and losing both it and your expensive arrow.

This is a good mentality. I always thought it would be frustrating to go hunting and get nothing, but just spending time in nature is valuable enough for me. It would be different if I was traveling or spending a lot to get to a place specifically to hunt tho. Like taking a plane or driving several hours.

Ah ok, thank you. I bought my girlfriend a handmade horse bow last year as I knew she liked archery (has bow hunted everything from rabbits to elk + moose) and was wondering how useful/useless the bow was, it's fun for target shooting at least

Usually you'll have local hunting laws that say what minimum poundage you need for what game. I'm sure they err on the side of caution. A 35 pound bow with a sharp arrowhead can still do a lot of damage. But I think it's good to be careful. They just banned bow hunting altogether in Australia because it's "inhumane". Probably started when some normie saw an animal running around the forest with an arrow lodged in its ribcage.

We're in the UK, bowhunting here is also illegal, yet flooding land with traps and poison isn't - it'll be a while before we go somewhere where we can legally hunt with her bow unfortunately.

Bans are insane when you consider that a crossbow or compound bow are just as accurate and just as lethal as any hunting rifle. But that's what you get when you have city sheltered idiots electing city sheltered politicians I guess.

I very much agree with you, I feel like it has something to do with the ease of access of bows here compared to firearms - it is ridiculous though that you can go and shoot small game with underpowered air rifles but not a bow.

How do I judge distance without using a range finder?
--- 2576516
any good books about subject?
--- 2576517
>>2576356
You don't. Buy a rangefinder, don't be a retard.

Got an elk 2 years ago, nothing last year but it was crazy fun

Why?

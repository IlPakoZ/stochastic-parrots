I'm gonna do it, /out/ The forbidden meat. I'm tired of people just wasting them, saying it's "too gross!". They can't all be right, and taste buds are only mouth deep. A full belly is a happy belly. I believe a man can eat anything after enough hard work.

I've been getting more into self sufficiency, and always wanted to cook and eat something, as a learning experience, but deer are too cute (and hard) to kill.
But there's a pack or two of coyotes that run around every night, and the locals are this close to culling them anyways cause they ate someone's husky, and make the farmers mad.

How do i do it?
I have gun but i got no skill, i don't know how to attract one. Can i use a trap?

I wanna spit roast one (pic related) but i don't know for how long or how you jam the pole through like that. Lube?

And what do i do with the interesting bits, like the head and tail and paws? I draw my line at eating feet. I think it would be cool to have a coyote head though.

>It'll be gross
shut up ill use hot sauce
>You'll get parasites
Shut up, jealous cause i'll get real life frens who rely on me and appreciate me for what's on the inside.
>Any counterargument
Hot. Sauce.

Find some deer corpses on the road.
Pile them on your property.
Get a spotlight
Get a gun
Enjoy dogmeat.

I'm so sick of taking a shotgun with me to take the dog to piss at night. Fuck coyotes.

I have no had dog meat yet , but Lewis and Clark and Horace kephart said it is second best meat of the forest, first being mountain lion. 

One thing to becareful of is parasites. in winter coyotes have less parasites , in the summer they have more . So check your meat and Becareful cooking it . These are parasites that I don’t know much about but they probably have serious consequences . So over cook them if you can , I’ll try hunting for my first taste of the forbidden meat this summer( I missed the winter). 

I can’t say I have and recipes but also don’t loose your nerve these are bad animals, and would lure other people pets into the woods and eat them alive.

I don’t know what you will use to hunt them but a 77 grain 223 or 556 or a green tip is probably the best caliber for a coyote. And no joke look up a Chinese recipe for dog

>>2574121 (OP)
You don’t want to spit roast the coyote, to cook a chicken over a spit is a procedure that takes hours. Use a gun and a spot light and maybe put out some meat , there are good videos online for that part.

Don’t eat the head , maybe the tail 

Here’s a recipe for your enjoyment if you do go through with this make sure to post it on /out/ and become a legend .

You can get a predator call to bring em in. I haven't eaten coyote as I don't hunt them, but I heard the meat tastes fine it's just super chewy.

Nice thread OP. I do t know the slightest about hunting coyotes, mainly because I am European, though it's a splendid idea. We've recently got invaded by jackals from the south and I guess that there's nothing wrong with trapping a invasive species. So I'll give it a shot

As for split-roasting I doubt that it's a good idea. Ted Kaczynski said something about cooking the meat for hours in a salt brine so that it becomes less chewy and so that all parasites die. Take that schizo's advice or not. It's your funeral.

humans are not meant to eat carnivores. we need to eat ruminants.

I've seen six year olds bag deer with bows.

It's not that complicated, and you must respect nature.

Nature provides the animal for your survival, not your amusement or psycho stuff. Food, clothing, materials, and so on. In fact, if you do not respect the hunting laws or are not able to make clean, ethical kills, you can get in trouble with the law. So check local laws first.

The coyote is most active at night, and it is mostly hunted for its very pretty and warm pelt, not its meat. Some night vision goggles or thermal goggles will go a long way. Can be kinda expensive. Otherwise, early morning and sunset is the best time to catch them active.

Go to the area where they have been spotted and look for fresh tracks, scat, a den. The best bait for coyotes is some kinda meat. If you want to increase your chances, consider pressure baiting. This means feeding it bait at the same time every day. Eventually, it gets used to it and shows up regularly, which is when you get the drop on it and shoot it.

I'll attach a shooting diagram.
--- 2574239
>>2574181

You can also do the all with just your mouth, it's kinda like a kissy noise, would look it up

>>2574236

If you want, you can set up your bait and just wait in a blind or in a tree, doing the calls and trying to bring it in.

But if you bait it for at least a day or two ahead of time, your chances of it showing up to eat the bait are much higher.

Then you got just one shot, in the heart/lungs area as demonstrated, and if you're accurate, you will be successful and have a coyote pelt and meat to eat. It ain't rocket science.

If you want to process your own coyote, learn to dress, skin, and butcher it. You can do this even just by hanging it on a tree with a hook.

Some game meats are gourmet delicacies, some game meats are pretty uncommon.

Not a ton of people at coyote meat, but you don't want to waste the riches of the hunt. I think if you marinate it and slow cook it like pulled pork or pulled beef, it would be tenderized and juicy. Would need a decent rub and sauce for sure.

Perhaps i may put the hot sauce away

>no spit roast
Man, i was looking forward to shoving a massive pole down the business end of an animal

Guess ill set up a fire pit grill. I ain't marinating it inside or anything, my apartment manger no longer allows to... "process" animals indoors after the incident, so i'd have to do everything in the woods. Im willing to camp overnight if it's gotta marinate though.

You can just pressure cook it or stew cook it at home, and you can take it to a processor if you want someone else to dress and clean it for you. You don't need to process it at home, but you can if you have space to do so.

It's really straightforward to dress and clean your own game, but people are just intimidated by the blood and guts and stuff. It's very similar for deer vs hogs vs coyotes. You need to remove the digestive system and organs, so your meat doesn't have piss and shit all over it, which is called dressing. Then skinning the hide, then cleaning which is carving it into cuts like you see in the grocery store.

If you want to process your own animal innawoods, you will need a hook or to tie it to a branch upside-down. Probably some videos or visual aid to help you get an idea of where to cut to dress it, which you can also do in the field right after the kill. People only see the end product of the meat cuts in the grocery store or prepared on their plate. Then you can pack up the meat and wrap it in butcher paper, some use bags, and a freezer with ice, even a cheap styrofoam one. You want to keep the cuts cold and preserved, preventing mold or infection from germs. The moment the animal dies, it's like meat sitting in the open air on the counter at room temperature.

That's why people just pay processors too, they will wrap and label everything in butcher paper and you get a clean hide too, but you can DIY if you really want to. If you are going to hunt, you will have to be responsible for that animal and making use of it after you harvest it. Coyote pelts are nice and the meat will feed you.

That being said, a lot of hunters just drop their animals off at the local wild game processor.

This would be a good backup option, but i don't have a car, nor a pack big enough to bike it over to the nearest butcher... if they even agree to doing a coyote.
Maybe i can ask one for advice or tools to get though. I have a razor sharp knife, but not like, any dedicated organ extractors or anything, though i'd assume most just... come out.

You can eat the non poopoopeepee organs though, right?

But to circle back, the entire point of this is to build skills.
I know you all had dads and stuff to teach you things... but im starting from nothing i guess

Yes, some innards can be eaten, but I've never tried to eat coyote offal. You can field dress it right where you shot it, and leave out the innards for other animals to eat. This also makes it lighter, and you can physically carry the game.

I mean they are not huge creatures, here is one that ate somebody's cat, so they hunted it to prevent it eating more pets in the area. You could carry multiple coyotes on a line through the wilderness.

All you need is a sharp knife, the sharper the knife the easier it is to process the animal. You can look it up online, but what you want to do is cut it open from the groin up, like a frog dissection basically, to the throat area. Without slicing up the organs, you can hold the organs down below the hide to get a clean cut.

Then you want to cut the esophagus or throat from the inside at the highest area, then the anus or ass tube at the lowest area. That's the whole digestive system, you then reach in and just scoop everything out. Now it's just hide and muscle, or meat. This makes it easier to carry, and you don't have to pay a dressing fee at the processor.

Skinning the dear and cleaning it is not something that would make sense to explain in text form, but it's very similar for hogs and deer as well. Would look this up online or ask a redneck or something, if you choose to skin and clean it yourself. The pelt is the most used part, so you want to do it cleanly and not damage it.

Basically, there are natural tendons along the animal where you can carve out cuts, like legs and ribs and so on. If you have ever carved a turkey or a whole chicken it's the same thing.

A wild game processor does this all day every day and does it really well, just charges a fee. If you hunt enough times, you will be able to do it yourself pretty quickly. It's a skill that takes time to develop, but it's a survival skill. As you can see people have a demand for removing coyotes and coyote hunters specifically make good money doing this. Like $50 a coyote, and they go out and shoot dozens of them at a time with night vision goggles. Mostly because they hunt and eat you cattle which is a huge cost for ranchers.

Down here, coyote hunters make around $150k on average, as they also own and operate their own wildlife service operations

I got a pretty solid plan in place now. I just gotta start trying
Im neet rn so i can go out every morning or so for this.
I guess i still need bait though. I don't really eat meat unless i know where it came from, so i don't have anything but veggie stuff on me.

Just can't see myself eating it. It's so close to dog.

see THIS is what pisses me off enough to do this! I kinda want to do it as a slap in their face that says, no, it's not inedible, your being a picky little brat who just wants to kill something with your fancy thermal scope.
"nah i don't eat coyote, it's too much like a cute doggy!"
BITCH, YOU KILLED IT. FINISH THE FUCKING JOB YOU LITTLE SHIT. Who raised them to kill and waste like that?
"it tastes bad!" SUCK IT UP, you got seasonings, dont ya? Ya got fire, don't ya?? 
Eat up! Or don't kill it!
Hunting coyotes for pest control doesn't work anyways, if it did, they wouldn't be coast to coast right now. So follow the rules every other hunter has to. 
You don't see deer hunters sending the carcasses to the landfill like yote hunters do. Even if they need to cull, the meat is donated, heck even donated to zoos or pred sanctuaries.
Even my local walmart donates it's bad meat to a wolf sanctuary.

Im only gonna be neet for so long (rent and bills :(
But it's been pouring rain up here, so it'll be a few days before im out in the field trying
Im gonna set up a trail cam and whatever bait i can get (i got dog food) in a place where i've seen some yote tracks.
I also got a spot staked out to pull this all off at, one my old camps that's unfavorable for any real work, but my firepit is still ok and it won't take long to rebuild the stuff i had.

Im getting pretty broke now, so i only have my one box of 9mm. Ill blow most of it zero/practice shooting but i'll be sure to save a mag or two's worth just in case. It'll only take one though

IMPORTANT TIP

What makes coyote taste bad is the fat, so every last piece of fat and silver-skin must be completely excised. Once that's done make jerky or cool it into tacos and its fine.

>must pay some boomer fudd to teach you "hunter safety" (180$) 
>have to buy loicense (25$)
>have to buy a tag for every deer (90-180$)
>rifle season is only 10 days A YEAR
>deer are very skittish during rifle season because they're hunted by everyone else first (bows, kids, veterans, disabled, muskets, etc)
>must wear gayze orange vest and hat or go to jail
>have to compete with everyone else for good spots, including retired boomers who can be there all week at 3AM and poachers who will just spotlight deer for EZ meat
>game wardens bugging you all the time and asking 20 questions, wanting to see loicense and tags
>people hunting with dogs scaring everything away because their season is at the same time as yours
At at the end of all this you MIGHT get a deer, and if you don't, you cant get refunds for all the tags and shit you bought. My experience hunting deer has been that if you don't have access to lots of private land don't even bother. 

Compare this to coyote, which you can shoot in your backyard or all year 'round and nobody cares. No orange, no tag or possession limits, or even a loicense needed. They're legally pests in most places.

All this to NOT solve the problem. They'll just fuck harder and their pups won't have parents to tell them to eat the mice and birds they're supposed to. So they'll starve and go straight for the easy prey, generation after generation.

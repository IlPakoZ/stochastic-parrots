Have you ever taken a girl /out/?
--- 2558160
yeah 2nd date with my current gf was an overnighter
idk if that many girls would accept that in retrospect, but its a very good way to build trust and get an idea of how well u live together
--- 2558161
>>2558159 (OP)
Yes. My wife and I will get drunk, take charcoal and draw over each others bodies, then dance naked around the fire.
--- 2558164
>>2558161
And sex?
--- 2558174
>>2558159 (OP)
Yeah I used to go hiking with my ex. My current GF does not like the outdoors much and does not mind me going /out/ regularly by myself and I lowkey prefer it this way. I can do whatever I want at my own pace.
--- 2558178
my ex and I would go hiking regularly, she would have me take photos of her infront of a rock or tree for her instagram, i was never allowed to be in them. she once threw a temper tantrum because we had to cross a muddy creek and she refused to get her shoes muddy
--- 2558185
>>2558159 (OP)
yes but it implied we wouldn't be able to go as far/as fast as I usually go, so it's a fun experience but shouldn't be done everytime you go /out/

>actually decent personality

>take her on a short one
>out of breath most of the time and complains here and there but manages to climb to the top

>>2558159 (OP)
I can't even imagine talking to a woman if she isn't into /out/ as much as I am. Every gf I've had was into backpacking, climbing, camping, nature, etc. I don't care if a chick isn't into fishing and hunting -- I don't expect them to be. If she's anti-hunting that's the end of it. I've turned down some otherwise decent women because they we're anti-hunting.

I may be an incel virgin manlet, but the last thing I want when I'm outdoors is the company of other people.
--- 2558835
Nope. Huge pain in the ass. The tribes of our pre-agricultural ancestors left women back in the cave or at camp except when they were migrating to a new cave or camp. Partly this was due to reproductive math, but just as importantly, women are slow, weak, fragile liabilities.

These are modern women we're talking about, too, so that's squared.

--- 2558860
>>2558835
Based.

Last time a woman tagged along a hike in a group of mine she had a mental breakdown 200m from the summit and did everything possible so none of the rest of the guys would reach it either.
Then all of sudden had coke energy down the mountain so nobody could keep up.

They do have the physical capabily but some of them don't have the right mindset to get things done right.
--- 2558861
>>2558860
What do you mean
That sounds retarded why wouldnt the people just go touch the summit then go back to her if she created a scene that needed attention
--- 2558865
>>2558861
At the summit going around the mountain would've been exactly the same distance going back just on the other side with new views and experiences so that's what we would've done.
I believe that was the problem that she couldn't take anymore "uncertainties".
Simply not an explorative mind.
I really doubt the problem was reaching the summit when it was just a few steps more.

I could be wrong, I mean I look at it logically and she probably wasn't.

And yeah it was retarded, her husband is a cuck and wouldn't manage her for the rest of us and nobody else felt like meddling in his affair, it would've been hell rest of weekend for him so we thought we did him a favour.

The point is I agreed with anon they are better left to tend the cave.

--- 2558976
>>2558965
I just talk to them but never ask women out unless they drool over me and walk after me. Modern women, It's all just so tiering... You are better off alone. Safe for your retirement and property purchase. Don't waste your time, nerves, or resources. Women will chase after you if you are ever good enough.
--- 2559010
>>2558159 (OP)
>Have you ever taken a girl /out/?
Yes. Often. First time I took my wife canoe camping was the first time she'd not slept within eye or ear sight of a car. It was the happiest I've ever seen her.
--- 2559157
>>2558374
It's a win-win for me because I need a few weeks by myself every year and women are kind a pain in the ass when going /out/. When I was still with my ex who enjoyed going /out/ I always ended up going for different routes than I actually wanted to.
--- 2559164
>>2558374
Most women don't like the outdoors. It's easier to just accept it. I've dated only one woman that actually wanted to go /out/, the rest think it's a novelty and they aren't interested in doing much more than a simple hike on a short and easy trail.
Like the other anon said, that's okay. It means you get /out/ time to yourself. One thing I make clear to any girl I'm dating is that she doesn't have to accompany me, but I will have my /out/ time. I've had a couple girls break up with me because I was too busy climbing. They think it's a phase or something I guess.
--- 2559165
Yeah she only comes out in the summer though so I have to go months in between where nobody sucks my willy outdoors

She was just a friend with benefits, I still miss her but damn don't get pregnant from someone while dating someone else.

>>2560990
Camping doesn't require any more thinking than hiking does. For camping, you need to select an optimal site and for hiking, you need to plan your route and have the navigation skills to get back on course if you lose your way. Camping involves condensation management and staying warm/dry. So does hiking. Setting up and taking down a tent isn't rocket science, as millions of casuals do it every year. Same with preventing critters from getting at your food. Minimal thinking involved there.

Took sister on our usual Dad/Son hunting mission. Got nearly to where we wanted to go and she freaked tf out at the last obstacle. tbf it was a pretty gnarly slip and I was pretty happy not to fry cross it but the thing is because it freaked her out she didn't want to go down the way she came up which had visual exposure to the obstacle but was otherwise safe. She wanted to go directly down the steep slippery tussock slope that would have been extremely dangerous and she would certainly fall in the current state she was in. Took a stern talking to convince her not to walk down the slippery shit that was way more dangerous than the perceived visual danger. This was right after she just froze and stopped moving at all for like 5 mins until I realized she was freaking tf out. Hard work man, then she was smug for the rest of the day because of her decision not to do the dangerous thing and stop us from reaching the cool place, lmao.

Off topic but that reminds me of taking my roomate up Shasta, he had never worn crampons or held an ice axe. The route was steep but conditions were good, but pretty soon after we traversed a snowfield I noticed him getting wide eyed. Then he started really bugging out. 
I had to give him the stern talk, got him to keep moving into a small boulder patch where he promptly laid down and fell dead asleep. I laughed, what else could I do. Let him sleep for an hour and he woke up collected, so we retreated. 
Summit fail but we got to hang out on a volcano so no big deal.

It was terrible. She loved "hiking and camping" and brought her overweight "hiking companion" pug and a chihuahua with her. We took breaks every couple yards so she could adjust something, catch her breath, or smoke weed. Half a mile down the trail we had to turn back because she had already finished her snacks, her entire water supply, all her weed (4 bowls worth), and her dogs were completely cashed out. We ended up going home and watching Alaska documentaries for several hours while she repeatedly mentioned that she could totally make it up there.

Water is still pretty cold for calico, you still have a shot at them, but it'sgonna be slow. You could still get spottys and sand bass in the bays until the water outside is closer to 60-62. If you want to paddle/pedal out though rockfish just opened back up. I just did a half day on Sunday and I guess the 9 mile opened up to bottom fishing for the first time in like 20 something years and there are a lot of really big reds out there if you don't mind fishing 500'+ of water.
--- 2562632
is lure type or color more important based on water conditions?
--- 2562633
>>2562631
Hmm, I'll just chill in the bay and shallow water until next month then. Good chance to build up my stamina again.
--- 2562635

Lure type always matter more.

Here is a pinfry pattern I tied recently.
--- 2562756
does line visibility matter for bass
--- 2562759
>>2562661
In the bay or outside? In the bay you'll get spottys about year round in the grass flats and sandies mixed with them in the deeper spots in the big bay. Outside you're looking at really slow calico, some sheephead and halibut this time of year. Rockfish and whitefish would start in more like 150'+.
--- 2562764
>>2562756
I would say in pressured waters where finesse presentations are most successful probably. Otherwise no, because if a bass is committed to chasing your lure or a reaction strike it likely isn’t looking at the line anyway
--- 2562766
>>2562764
i've never really understood the argument considering there's hooks dangling off shit
--- 2562773
>>2562766
I think would notice real thick line if the water is clear. Also rigid line can affect the lure's action and make it look less natural. Probably not an issue for bass since they have downs syndrome, but it definitely makes a difference for highly pressured trout in my experience.
--- 2562782
>>2562766
If I’m fishing a heavily pressured city pond I’m downsizing considerably, relative to lmb fishing. 6-8lb line small plastics on dropshot, ned or compact jigs. The fish need more time to inspect the lure and say this is actually food i want to eat. If I’m going to a less trafficked area or bigger body of water I don’t worry so much. I can throw the big swim baits, Chatterbaits and tandem bladed spinners on 30lb braid with 12-20lb leader going after that reaction bite. Downsized presentations work everywhere but they’re better suited for targeting a specific area opposed to searching for your bite
--- 2562790
>>2562773
its rare i ever go above 8lb line, most generally 6#
mostly stained water as well, we don't have anything super clear like i've seen out west
--- 2562801
bass hit stuff depending on a very specific set of often random variables. casting and running a lure by them one way might work one day and not the next, even if the retrieve angle is barely any different. dinks hit anything, but the big ones are very very hesitant unless you roll the slots right. I always have much better luck trying to trigger a reaction strike with a fast moving bait than trying to "entice them" to try something. if they don't get a good look at it they will often commit. it's pretty odd considering they will look at a basic bitch plastic worm and hit it.
--- 2562802
I had to go swimming today for my snagged $8 Yo-Zuri. Anything over $3 and I'm swimming to get it.
--- 2562805
>>2562802
yozuri makes great lures
--- 2562807
>>2562805
They are good but I'm too spoiled by lucky craft
--- 2562808
>>2562790
I run 6lb copoly for 90% of my freshwater fishing with fly and lures. There's a c&amp;r fly river I fish where the water is gin clear and most of the fish have been caught at least a dozen times. That's when I'll pull out the 2lb fluoro and it makes a difference.
--- 2562810
>>2562801
It ain't radom, kid. Check the barometer an consult the astrological charts. If the bullfrogs are croaking in D minor it's gonna be a shit day.
--- 2562819
>>2562782
I hear the terms "searching" and "this bait works for searching" often and I wonder "Gee, if I'm catching fish on a particular bait, why would I suddenly change?" If I'm catching dinks I'll for sure change SOMETHING but I don't spazz out and start drop shotting if I just boated a 6 pound bass on a cb. Am I doing it wrong?
--- 2562823
>>2562819
It's a bass thing, you wouldn't understand
--- 2562847
I am not catching anything, and others are catching a ton. (Was just talking with some guy who uses the exact same setup as me, bottom weight and floating powerbait dough) I don't know what I am doing wrong. I feel very dumb.
--- 2562849
>>2562819
for me, search baits are spinnerbaits and lipless cranks, if they catch a few, i'll stick with them
--- 2562912
This 4 weight is gonna be so sick

Welcome fellow fly fag
Nice little streamer, looks like it could be used as a stone fly in a pinch too

>>2562913
I have an old school Redington fiberglass 3wt rod that's about 7.5 feet long and man it's so fun to fish with. The loading and casting is a hoot, and fishing for fat blue gill in ponds and streams never gets old.
--- 2562919
>>2562916
Yeah no gills and dink bass on light fiberglass is great, and I can only imagine how much fun two-hand casting for them will be.
--- 2562920
>>2562849
I get the difference between a bait you can cover a lot of water with one you can't; I usually start with a spinnerbait or a crank as well and move to slower/smaller baits if I need to. I don't get the idea that a bait be used to "search" for bass, as if a particular bait gets a lot of follows or short strikes. If I'm getting follows chances are I already know where a fish is (muskie is a different story, I've been surprised) and I'll alter the retrieve or use a jerk bait before I soak a senko or switch to drop shot. My bait getting bumped and short strikes aren't such a big deal that I'd label it "searching"; of course I'd switch to a smaller or slower bait. If I'm fishing specifically for pelagic bass of course I'm searching and will cover as much water as I can, but I still don't call a spinnerbait or crankbait a "search bait". 

>>>2562823
Suck a dick, tough guy.

>>2562913
This is gonna be super cool too
--- 2562958
Anybody ever eat trout eggs ? I was thinking about frying some up. But see mixed reviews. I was going to try and cure some for bait if the eating route isn't worth it.
--- 2562977
>>2562958
I've heard of some old timers eating em but I don't know of any recipes. I'd say go ahead and just cure them.
--- 2562994
I'm having a real hard time getting over a girl like I haven't in a really longtime. I wish I hadn't taken her to all my favorite fishing spots. They're all tainted now. She was a rockhound and would look for rocks while I fished and there's this huge crystal rock near one of my best spots and I can't look at it without wanting to tear up like a big blubbering faggot.
--- 2563021
>>2562994
Did you even get laid bro?
--- 2563026
>>2563021
yeah, part of what has me so fucked up about it is the last time I ever saw her was a night fishing and It was all lovey dovey kisses under the stars, going back to my place to watch movies andt fucking like animals for the next 7 or 8 hours. Everything seemed right in the world that night. A few days later she goes cold out of nowhere. tells me to leave her alone and blocks me on everything when I ask her what was wrong.
--- 2563027
>>2563026
Sounds like she just has an episode. The relationship might rebound back if it's something sudden like that. It's the slow and gradual break down that is more difficult to fix.
--- 2563046
>>2563027
I would think that but it's been 6 months without a hint of anything.. Pretty sure it's done. even if right now she showed up here and begged me to forgive her, I would but I would never trust her ever again
--- 2563095
can i get a quick tip on lures or fishing methods for lakes in central sweden? will be hiking there around may/june with pic related, looking to catch something nice to eat (pike ir bass maybe?)
also going to try fly fishing, wish me luck
--- 2563102
>>2563095
If you’re not used to fishing with lures, I gotta shill inline spinners. Should be good for pike and bass that time of year. Not sure what brands you get, but Mepps is my favorite in the US and Rooster Tails are cheaper alternatives.

Any jerkbait or floating bait like Rapala Husky Jerks or Original are real easy to fish too, the jerkbaits take a little technique.
--- 2563105
>>2562626
i always carry one with me during summer
most fun way to fish with 100% results
--- 2563107
>>2562626
Never seen a pole fisherman that isn't a fat old bastard.
--- 2563114
>>2563102
I use spinners all the time for trout in smallish mountain streams, best lure next to worms.

Aren't they too small for pike tho? Or are there giant ones that don't get used where i live (Austria)?
Bought a big ass redhead Rapala Husky, good to know they work!
--- 2563130
>>2563026
Was the the thick bitch anon took out on a canoe? You didn't mutilate any fish in front of her did you? Only mat can do that because he's such a player.
--- 2563145
any techniques you guys absolutely refuse to use
i won't drop shot
--- 2563241
>>2563145
Use lures. I did that for years before i realized that i like more of the drink beer and wait style of boomer bait fishing.
--- 2563248
>>2563145
refuse to use mop flies and certain fly patterns. Even though I don't tournament fish it's just unfair to the fish and I feel like a cheater. MNR should ban some patterns and mop flies altogether. Hefty 5000 fine.
--- 2563251
>>2563145
Fuck strike indicators, contact nymphing all the way
--- 2563262
>>2563114
>Aren't they too small for pike tho? Or are there giant ones that don't get used where i live (Austria)?
Big pike will eat small lures if you put them in the right place, but also they do make giant spinner baits. I think the biggest inline spinner that Mepps sells is over 2 oz (56 grams).
--- 2563263
>>2563262
yeah I caught most pike and even my largest on the smallest size spinner I have
--- 2563278

what's the issue with mop flies?
also, what patterns don't you like

looking to get back into fly fishing which is rare in my area
--- 2563360
>>2563248
This. Millennials go "fly fishing" use mop flies and other cheater patterns, easily reach their limit, often more, and return to the same spot the next day and do it all over again. I swear they won't even work for their fish let alone get a real job/career. They also use gps on their phones to mark spots so they guarantee to return to the same honey hole over and over, completely destroying the sport with their technology addictions. Don't even get me started with how they need a picture of every fish they catch. They actually have the nerve to ask others for their honey holes, a complete sense of entitlement. Sorry youngster, got mine. Find your own. Lazy technology obsessed and unwilling to work. 'ate em
--- 2563365
>>2563360
lol
--- 2563371
>>2563360
What the fuck are mop flies anyway? Are they really that effective?

All the rich fags euro nymph now. Their flies are so lame and they don’t usually tie their own. If they do tie, all they can slap together are perdigons. Don’t get me wrong, weighted flies right to the feed zone is fine, but that’s literally all they can do and are only semi effective on larger rivers that don’t have a bunch of stocked fish holding in three different places. They hardly land anything over 10” faggot my phony.
--- 2563374
>>2563027
nah that sounds like a bitch who just jumps from man to man. she's trash. there is absolutely no reason to get sad over someone like that. if it had ended up in long-term, or marriage, he would have got divorced rape after she cheats.
--- 2563375
>>2563114
big fish can get caught on very small spinners, but if occasionally the hooks on the smaller spinners can get bent out. Mepps makes larger sizes specifically for larger fish, even huge musky spinners. If you want to target larger fish get a sze 2 or 3 Mepps at minimum.
--- 2563376
>>2563145
I don't use wacky rigs and many other finesse bass techniques. Only a ned rig/standup head and NEVER with your typical plastic worm. I don't want to pull out every 2lb bass that's been caught 20 times. I also won't use buzzbaits, whopper ploppers, or non-walking frogs.
--- 2563380

I’ve caught an 8 lb pike on 1/8 oz spinner while targeting browns and smallies. It’s nerve racking as hell when you’ve got decent pike on an UL setup with like 4 lb test. 

I’ve lost a fair few more 1/8th oz spinners the same way, which is why I run single hook and barbless when fishing small baits on light line. Same for #03 Ripping Raps, though my best pike on one of those was more like 5 lbs.
--- 2563430
>>2563374
I know objectively i'm better off without her, i know it'll scar over eventually right now shit just sucks. never imagined it would fall apart the way it did.

gearfagging aside, are telescoping fishing rods good enough for travel fishing?
--- 2563504
>>2563495
I'm sure there are a few nice ones, but they won't be cheap. WAY more good options of multi-piece travel rods, and way better pricing. less failure points too by design.
--- 2563507
>>2563504
The only downside of multi pieces rods is they might get stuck.
I have a 2 piece rods that I haven't been able to separate back to 2 pieces.
--- 2563544

you prevent that with maintenance and never leaving it together for extended time. most people use ferrule wax

How can I catch a carp this time of year? I never fished carp before but I found a park that has a pond filled with dozens of small (about one foot long) carp. I tried sweet corn and they were swimming right by it with no reaction. They weren't even eating the corn I chummed. 
Any tips? The park is urban so I think the fish are used to people, but there's so many and they're small so I doubt all of them have been caught before.

Bros, I was in a pier in case anything was biting. As soon as I start leaving I hear a big splash and think it's gotta be a striper, immediately start casting, see another splash after a minute, keep casting. 
Couple minutes pass, im reeling in sudddenly a boat comes rushing back to the dock, stops right 50 meters from me... I start moving to have a better casting place. They cast one out right there and 10 secs later, fish gets hooked...wooohs at me, he's happy.

--- 2564809
>>2564731
the pole is 8ft and taking into account the box/pvc about 7 feet of it can be used. I imagine I'll be anchoring in no more than 5 feet most of the time which is great for creeks and bed/pad fishing on lakes.
--- 2564821
>>2564809
The possible down side of the system is that the pole wouldn't penetrate the ground from just a drop so you have to manually push it into the ground anyway. When people use pole anchor, it's typically simple cave man shit where they jam a pole through the drain hole or attach a rope to connect the pole to the kayak and just jam it down

where do you guys buy nikko lures from
--- 2564832
>>2564766
pretty good idea
i will steal that actually 
i will order a few mayflies and spinners
then i will cut the treble hook off, add a split ring and the fly.
--- 2564835
>>2564821
True but typically where it would be used is soft gravel or sand. I plan on using it for positioning near banks and in creek channels where it's mostly soft. It has its limitations but it'll work most of the time. I've even seen people put weights on the poles so it goes down better.
--- 2564837
>>2564835
Ah that's fine. I just question the effort to put in such system when you can just use the caveman way with the pole anchor.
--- 2564843
>>2564837
It's actually not very complicated. Paracord is tied to the bottom of the pole, it comes up through a box, over and through an eye bolt, then out of the box to where you sit. Then you cleat the rope to keep the pole up and release it when you want it down. 
The complicated part is securing a platform for the box on the uneven transom of a kayak and feeding the rope to where you sit. You can do it on top or through the hull where you'd out rudder or steering cables.

I got 2 lures at home
The right one is 3g and the left 6g

What is a good/cheap rod that is good for these lures?
I'm looking to expand my Lure knowledge and amount of lures in my bag

I'm also the guy that asked if a spinning rod can be used for other species and methods like Barbel and carp fishing.
--- 2564871
>>2564867
I also just saw a shimano slx but it's still 70€...
If i could get something a little more cheaper
--- 2564875
>>2564867
there are a lot of fishing rods my man, just pick a decent brand with a decent price and weight range.
Personally I use a rod thats rated 20-70 grams and I still use smaller lures with it. It's not perfect but it does the job still
--- 2564877
>>2564867
also go to the store, people there can help you better and its nice to have a feel for the rod you are choosing. You can always choose to order the same model but online
--- 2564886
>>2564867
6ft medium action rod with a spinning reel. You can get cheap combos like that for under $50
--- 2564897
>>2564867
for those, you want a medium light rod. usual lure rating on rods like that are around 3.5-14g or 3.5-10.5g for example. paired with some mono like 8lb trilene xl for example, since it's limp and thin enough to work smaller hardbaits without messing up the action, but it's still pretty strong.
--- 2564922
>>2564886
Dang... That's pretty nice
On the 12th I'll go to the store then

>>2564877
>>2564875
I'll do that

>>2564897
I heard that superficial lures all have the same movement and the rod doesn't matter. Is this right?
I heard that it's more used at the bottom of the water because you can feel the bottom
--- 2564925
you guys DO watch the master bait maker right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqny_VuCYgI [Embed]
--- 2564940
>>2564925
ofc, he got me into luremaking.
He might not be the best since he still sometimes makes lure where the action sucks. But they do always look amazing. I like that he tackles a lot of designs and does some softbait making too
--- 2564942
>>2564922
I'm not talking about getting specific rods for specific lures, just a rod that's rated for specific weight range of lures. You don't want to be casting 3g lures on medium rods or heavier line, it will have shit casting distance, and the rod won't bend at all when working the lures. medium light is limber enough to be able to work countless smaller baits, and cast them well, yet not have any real disadvantage on heavier lures like 10g. it's just the more versatile rod. it's better to have a rod that bend easier than a stiffer rod when it comes to a using a wide range of hardbaits. a medium rod is better for things like setting hooks on larger finesse baits, and large hardbaits like 10cm length. you will limit the versatility of the rod by getting a stiff rod. many people make this mistake before going and getting a softer rod. "a medium action rod is the perfect all-rounder" mainly refers to big bass fishing in america, because a lot of techniques are finesse fishing with heavy wire hooks, topwater frogs, and big spinner/chatterbaits.
--- 2564946
>>2564940
>He might not be the best since he still sometimes makes lure where the action sucks
True, but you can learn from every single one of his videos even when he makes those wild "lures" lol. I only started making lures last year and I'm making a bunch for this summer. 
Making a 2.5 inch, 4 inch, and 6 inch swim bait and some crank baits. Also doing some hard body spinners which I love fishing with.
--- 2564948
>>2564940
also what clear coat do you use? I've been using just 30 minute epoxy and it worked out at first but it's really been chipping and cracking way too easily. Thinking of going to KB Diamond Clear because you just dip it in and pull it out then let it drip.
--- 2564953
>>2564948
lupa envirotex lite, its been treating me alright. One time I didnt mix the 2 components correctly but the coat was still usable. Its just a little softer since it didnt hard correctly
does take 24 hours to dry though

>>2564871
> NEX611LMFC
--- 2564959
>>2564953
I just hate that I make a nice bait that works really well and it's the clear coat that fails rather than it getting snagged or not performing well.
--- 2564970
i hate riging softbaits on jigs
i can't get it right
either the lure is too far forward or too far back
--- 2564972
>>2564970
I don't like jigs in general. I usually texas rig.
--- 2564975
>>2564972
but you still have to put it on a hook
that is the part i hate and that i obviously can't do
--- 2564998
>>2564975
you get used to it, line the bait up with the hook to see where the hook point should come out
--- 2565005
>>2564970
you need to measure it first. it's only really annoying with extremely durable baits that are tough, or really fragile ones that fall apart if you mess up once. trying to just estimate is the hardheaded way and rarely works.
--- 2565013
the bite was going crazy today, my arm is tired now
--- 2565018
>>2565013
nice, I caught a similar sized brown yesterday on a inline spinner fly, only had one other bite though

--- 2565076

then a little while later i swung this guy up on a white streamer. after that i moved to a new spot and i hooked two more on an inline spinner but i lost both of them because i suck.
--- 2565078
Pic, in the middle of swallowing another mosquitoefish(?) alive. 
Guys so far I have learned that the redfin truly does stay completely (I cannot stress that enough) motionless for long periods of time. When he decides to hunt he points his body, very very slowly, at the target, regardless of steepness of angle. Over the course of 2 or 4 minutes he very very slowly moves towards target before an outrageous burst of speed. Extremely drunk, will try to write up a more detailed report in the future.

I think natural color is better in clear water, and lgbt colors in shitty waters. Lure type and fishing it correctly is more important i think

Mepps are generally god tier spinners
--- 2565155
>>2563114
I had a 35gram one of these assholes, spinners arent always small. Pike will hit anything. Ive had a pike attack the tip of my rod while unhooking a trout, because the tip was clearing the platform and not much more than 10cm above water, granted it was a small one. But they will generally hit anything, some days they hit my float when i use roach as dead bait (stirry water). A good rule of thumb is that larger bait gets rid of smallest hits. Though they sometimes hit jerk baits that are larger than them because they are retarded or just trying their luck.

You just need practice. Measure the jig and plastic side by side to see where the hook will come out . Mark the top of the plastic (you can do it with the hook tip). Thread the plastic in jig slowly, take your time to adjust to make sure everything is centered. Push the tip of the hook through the marked spot when you get there. 
Jigs should be easy. Trying to thread big plastic swimbait like these only the jig head nicely is a bigger pain in the ass but I can do it easily now with some practice (with trials and failures during practice)

I just lost someone i knew for 15 years. Turns out she talked shit about me to everyone when i wasnt around. Explains why her family and friends dont like me though. She specifically told people that i was a violent alcoholic, little did she tell them about how she gets day drunk and fall down the stairs with her neighbours present, and how i take care of her every time she gets blackout drunk and vomit for hours.

Black/blue, white, and red are my go to stained colors. If the water is always dirty I feel you can get away with natural colors more, but if the water is usually clear and gets dirty following heavy rain the bold colors seemingly help
--- 2565241
>>2565153
In fairly clear water, I do good with natural colors and stuff like pumpkinseed and watermelon and baby bass.

In mildly cloudy water, some of the brighter colors and white, and slightly darker colors like there’s a Zoom color called “sprayed grass” that’s like halfway between a pumpkinseed or watermelon and a darker junebug or okoeechobee. Also gold hardbaits and spinners.

In cloudy water, dark stuff like junebug, that black/purple seems to do work in the muddy stuff with less visibility.

In clear but stained water, like that brown color, if the natural stuff isn’t working, chartruese pepper will do the job for some reason. Pic related is some clear but stained lake where these peacocks won’t touch shit but chartruese.
--- 2565242
>>2562567 (OP)
I hardly use anything but inline spinners and spoons recently. I don't know why but they seem to almost universally be the most effective lure, except for specific use cases like jigging ledges and docks. Stopped going to Caboomers or any fishing store BC I can buy spinners spoons and jigs at any dollar store. Highly recommend them, paired with a light weight rod and low test line which makes the fight more exciting. Anyone else do this? Fish with a few lures almost exclusively?
--- 2565254
>>2565242
I did that before moving to Florida. I always thought it was impossible to catch bass in July and August in the Midwest, and Florida is like those water temps 10 months out of the year. Then I learned how to use a Texas rig.

Spinners are for panfish, Jan-Feb, at dusk and when a coldfront is coming.
--- 2565300
>>2565242

I only use casting spoons for covering water, since they cast well. Other than that not a fan of them at all, put a lot of work in with them and own a ton and just find they don't catch as good as other lures.
--- 2565332
>>2565242
>>2565254
very small inline spinners work year round for bass and panfish. like Mepps 00 and 0 and some 1 sizes. I think they're just irritating to fish and they can't exactly make out what it is when it flies by them fast. it's just flash, noise, and vibration. for that reason it's a good searchbait. most bass fisherman use the big old spinners with skirts but I outfish all my buddies when they're using them and I'm using small Mepps. I have great success with the more plain ones too, not the dressed ones.
--- 2565350
>>2563145
Drop shot, basically any bass finesse technique. I swimbait fish majority of the time but still fish conventional lures, but they're all stupid big, like a 13" worm wacky rig or a big spinnerbait. I love throwing a spinnerbait.
--- 2565389
>>2565332
Mepps 00 fucking suck from shore when it’s hot and bass are sitting kind of deep off a ledge and you can’t cast the thing more than 30ft and it won’t run more than a couple feet deep.
--- 2565425
>>2565155

--- 2565436
>tfw you realize lure fishing is one giant meme
I've caught more fish on simple bobber and worm or a piece of bread than I have throwing around lures
--- 2565441
>>2565436
I mean if numbers is all youre go ahead, but lure fishing for pike, musky or something else that fights is more fun to me. bread or worm bobber fishing are usually just fish you can lift out of the water without a drill
--- 2565442
>>2565436
I don't want to catch blue Gill
--- 2565455
>>2565441
>>2565442
Haven't caught a pike yet but I've netted small bluegill around an inch or two and used those to catch bass. Also literally just wacky rigging an entire earthworm always works for me. Also caught a trout yesterday on a worm (stocked by FWS so it doesn't really count tho) 
I think people underestimate how much smell factors into fishing, even with sight predators like bass. That's why people whine about Gulp being cheating.

I'm also just tired of wasting my money when I snag on underwater logs and other shit I can't see. Plus the pollution I'm causing when I have to cut the line and leave it there.
--- 2565458
>>2565436
depends what you are fishing for. also a lot of popular lures are large and oversized. I have had days where they won't touch bait but destroy lures.
--- 2565474
>>2565455
>Plus the pollution I'm causing when I have to cut the line and leave it there.
Bro please educate yourself you are not supposed to just cut your line and leave it there. I knew you were a beginner from what you 1st said but this is fucking bad Next time try pulling your bait up instead of cutting it when you get caught on a twig.
--- 2565513

recently started fishing for the first time since I was ten years old, same rod and everything. Had this happen to my reel the other day, no idea what all the terminology means, just want another spinning reel that's similar to it but won't break on me.
My pole is medium fast 6'0" if that matters idk.
I usually just run bait + bobber but I want to try an inline spinner, again idk if that matters.
this reel was 5.2:1 gear ratio with 3-6 lbs line rating

--- 2565646
>>2565389
they have a model called the XD(extra deep) and you gotta cast them on a light rod. I use a Crappie jig shooting rod for small inline spinners and it launches them far as fuck. I don't really fish spinners in deep areas like that anyways though. If I'm targeting bass on a deep dropoff, I use a slow-sinking jerkbait, a lipless crankbait, or a craw on a standup jig. If I'm bank fishing and can throw a small spinner parallel to a bank though and cover a lot of bank, it's killer.
--- 2565648
>>2565436
this happens if you're using "normal sized" lures... but switch to small shit and watch what happens. I'm talking under 2 inches.
--- 2565650
>>2565524
grab a shimano sienna fg SN2500FG or SN2500HGFG($29) if you want a solid cheap reel. pair it with some 8lb trilene xl line. modern "plastic" reels won't do that unless you literally step on them.
--- 2565652
>>2565602
discounttackle for lures. tackledirect and tacklewarehouse for rods, reels, ect. tackledirect's shipping is retardedly fast even for standard shipping. they are in NJ and I got my shit several states away in like 2 days with standard shipping. I even asked for specific packaging method in the order comment and they did it for me.
--- 2565657
>>2565620
the good thing about discounttackle is their shipping is only like $3.99 when you don't spend the $50 or whatever threshold for free shipping. combine that with most lures always being a dollar or two cheaper than anywhere else(as long as it isn't on sale), it's the best place to order a couple of lures because after you combine the shipping price you can't get cheaper anywhere else.

If you like to catch fish, fishing is really a planning and knowledge game. While there are some fisheries you can just go out whenever and experiment and learn something new, a lot of fisheries are also tough and knowledge about how to already fish it is key.

rod is some extendable junk about 2 and a half 3 meters long the spinning reel looks ok and holds 300 meters of line the line is 15 kilo pull weight on my dads fishing rod and i also got a basic set a while ago from a sporting goods and rigged it from scratch same rig except its 150 meters of line with 13 pull weight and on the hook line i got some 11kg weight line 0.35 mm thick so its a bit thinner (pic related)

--- 2565734
>>2565731
This is my method
Main line connected to the weight and the hook line connected to the weight.
But that method is equally right. You can even tie more than 1 hook in your line with that method

As I was shore angling, a bass angler strolled on up in his nice Ranger boat, plopped his power pole down and started to fucking drop shot this 2 pound male off a bed DIRECTLY in front of me. Saw him take a bunch of photos with it, put it in his live well and left. 

Had to stop fishing and just breathe slowly to calm myself down. This is my biggest pet peeve. After he left I threw my Deps 250 around that bed, got this female. Guess he didn’t see her.

In my area you will only be able to catch trout and blue Gill if you downsize.
--- 2565865
>>2565853
nah. if you fish highly pressured areas, downsizing will catch bass too. of course you will get some smaller species naturally, but that happens with big lures as well. I have bluegill and other sunfish/crappie hit big hardbaits fairly often.
--- 2565875

I'm sorry to break it to you, but fish don't give a fuck about "realistic looking to humans." they don't view things the same as you do. most people's ultra-realistic looking lures are paper weights, meanwhile retarded looking crankbaits with colors that don't replicate real fish do work. you ever seen a senko?

Mas eu ensino-lhe.
Na semana passada ensinei-lhe a boia de correr para pesqueiros fundos.

Antigamente a licença de pesca nacional era 5€ e agora é 20€ infelizmente.
O peixe gato anda a matar os peixes todos de antigamente. Bogas já são bem raras.

Tenho um colega que já é patrocinado por 2 empresas e recebeu um barco gratuito e várias amostras de achigã e lucio perca

What about going to the complete opposite end and throwing fuck huge lures? Every now and again I bring my swimbait rod to the community pond, get told my lures are too big and I’ll never catch anything.

our salmon fishing is world class. 
Trout fishing is world class, including ocean browns.
Peacock bass &amp; Golden Dorado (need to go north for Dorado) are two of the most sought after sportfish on the planet. 
Also deep sea fishing...Everything is here

I've always been a baitcaster purist who's refused to use Shimano DC reels but for some reason recently I've been wanting to get one just to see what using them is actually like. Should I just do it or would it make me a faggot?

doesn't work as good but you might get lucky I guess. I fish a heavily pressured lake where even on the weekdays you have 100 retired bassboat boomers from sunup to sundown. they probaby go there every other day. I catch no bass at all on your conventional bass shit, not even dinks... but If I take my panfish tackle I catch multiple a day, and around 20 inchers on average. of course I catch lots of other shit while doing it, but you will get absolutely skunked at that lake if you throw normal shit targeting bass 9/10 trips. people even post on forums that the lake is "dead" or must have had a "die-off" that's how bad it is. every bass I pull in is missing half it's lip so you can tell it's been caught dozens of times at least. I've recently started buying lots of BFS harbaits because it's the closest large lake to me and it's hilarious catching bass in front of guys who have $50k boats and 12 rods laying out on the deck. I've told this here before but guys will even pull up to me asking what I'm using and they laugh, tell me I just got lucky, and that my "bream" tackle is gonna get the hooks bent out on bass(which they never do.)
--- 2566168
>>2566073
> 1/20oz to 1/6oz
that's an odd range. is that just the weight of the jig heads without the soft plastics? the daiwa aird-x rods are very sensitive for a budget rod, especially when using braid.

I'm fishing the Florida Intercoastal on some docks, &amp; while it's fun, I'm doing 1 snapper per 12 shrimp MAX. They're all around 10 inches to a foot since it's coastal. Do I switch to cut pilchards? Sand fleas? Help me out here.

I don't think good sushi is overrated, but the generic stuff you usually get definitely is.

>>2566165
Should have been a bit more clear that I do have success throwing glides, kind of a why not both question. I have my best success with panfish tackle there, it’s an urban man made community pond that gets fished to high hell. It’s just the closest thing i can fish after work. Every now and again i get a wild hair up my ass and wanna throw a glide granted it’s not as productive although when it is it’s always a decent fish. Whenever I have my panfish or swimbait setups I get told I’m not using the right stuff by guys using standard bass tackle who aren’t catching anything
--- 2566231

It’s not bad, deep sea fishing is right off the coast and tons of good freshwater, plus the mangroves and so much inshore, dudes even fly fish in the calm saltwater. The only thing is probably no mountain stream fly fishing for tiny little trout.

Funny story is there was some anon from Asia like Thailand or some shit where snakeheads are native and he would comment on how giant the Florida canal sneks are because they’re overfished like crazy in Asia by people trying to catch dinner.

Is crappie anon still around? 

I'm getting tired of fishing with worms. I caught one bluegill on a 2inch fluke this year. I've tried inline spinners, standard and downsized jerk baits and crank baits. Beetle spins. I used tear them up on floating rapalas. I guess the water may be too cold still.

--- 2566437
>>2566342
I think you might be referring to me, but that looks like a good fish. I haven't really caught many crappie yet since winter, but the weather has been all over the place so I've gone fishing way less than I normally do. I'll be testing those small jerkbaits out soon though, I feel like it's finally starting to "stay" spring weather wise. Late summer and early fall is when I had a lot of luck with jerkbaits specifically last year.

Hey man welcome to fishing I see you're already confused jaded and angry at everyone. So how about you find a different hobby?

Did you by any chance also buy the robo goldfish lure?

Does anybody here spearfish? I do a lot of freshwater spearfishing. Largemouth bass is my favorite, but I'll take trout for eating.

--- 2566551
Ontario going through a week of good weather (18-25 celsius), going to be fishing the first time this year. Won't have a problem with crappie as I just find a school and use the same small coloured jigheads with a tail and generally can get 10+ in the boat for a nice feast. My question is, what would you guys throw this time of year during a small heat spell for bass? (LM+SM).
Already plan on throwing small crankbaits but if it doesn't work think a ned rig should do the trick?

eu sempre fui no outro dia,mas nao apanhei nada, o pesqueiro onde fui aqui no montijo é conhecido como porto das lesbicas e agora sei porque hahahha, tive três horas a dar banho á minhoca e nao picou nada acho que os pesqueiros aqui são fraquinhos, vou tentar aprender mais tipos de pesca tambem, para ir a outros sitios pescar, acho que para a semana vou a setubal ver se pica,
--- 2566565
>>2566458
If its deep there will be bass there all year long including the winter. If its shallow you can most likely get migratory bass spring and fall and then schoolies and rats in the summer.
--- 2566571
>>2566458
Check the tide charts for the area, generally you want to fish during a moving tide either on the rise or fall
--- 2566574
bought a 2500 reel and looking to buy 10 pound braid. Will 150 yards be enough?
--- 2566581
>>2566574
it should tell you on reel what the capacity is. a lot of people will only spool 150 yards of braid to save money and the rest of cheap mono backing to fill the spool.
--- 2566585
>>2566437
Maybe. If you were the one always posting a slab. I'm on mobile so digging through the archive is a pain. 

Weather has been similar here. It's been like that here as well. Around the time was same for me but 2 years. Not sure what changed last year but there was only bluegill close at one of my spots. Now I've moved again and don't have as much time but it's hard to pass up a nice day and fish after class.
--- 2566600
>>2566574
No it won't. Will probably take 200yds or more of 10lb.
--- 2566613
>>2566574
I feel like most reels have a true capacity that is a little smaller than what they say on the reel. Or it’s the 10lb braid thay claims to be the diameter of 2lb or 4lb test, it ends up being a little thicker. 

Anyway the 2500 size varies between companies, but 10lb is thin so it may not be enough. I would grab a ~300yd spool if possible but you could also do like 50yds of mono backing easily.
--- 2566618
>>2566574
the specified capacity is usually printed on the reel or the manual
--- 2566624
caught this little guy in a creek
--- 2566628
>>2566581
>>2566600
>>2566613
>>2566618
ok so the reel says braid capacity 10/150... so basically it's exactly a perfect fit? too close to call? should I go with 300 yards? It's a "shimano miravel"
--- 2566642
>>2566574
depends on the reel. daiwa lts have retardedly deep spools so no way, and most other reels in 2000 size take around 150yds. you could just add mono backing first.
--- 2566644
>>2566628
like the other guy said, usually the diameter listing or spool capacity listing is off, often by quite a bit... so always just buy more line than you need and spool it up visually. Shimanos tend to hold about 10-15yds less than they claim from my experience, but that could just be variance in line diameters. some companies specifically list what brand braid, but even then it's a bit off. just buy the 300yd spool.
--- 2566650
>>2566168
just the range i use for neds, would more than likely be running straight flouro in the 4# range

anyone familiar with monsterbass rods?
--- 2566694
>>2566650
>looks up monster bass
>they sell monthly mystery box
Hard no. If you're going to spend over $50 on a rod buy a Saint Croix or Shimano or at least a Fenwick eagle.

Que isco andavas a utilizar?

--- 2566733
So i bought my first spinning rod
Daiwa samurai 2.10m aka 6.88"
At their website it's at 42€ but i paid just 31 at a local store

The rod is M and not MH
Does that make much difference?
--- 2566782
anyone ever use a levante? worth the price?
--- 2566791
>>2566733
>M and not MH
Depends on what you want to do with it. If your local shop had it cheaper than online, good deal.
--- 2566797

some things cast beter on one or the other, same with giving action to a lure. But its not something I would worry about

Nigger pull your line until it breaks at the hook/lure you dumb fuck. 

If I catch anyone just casually leaving fishing line in the water I'll casually leave my nasty bait knife in their sphincter

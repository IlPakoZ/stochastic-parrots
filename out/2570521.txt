Anyone here have experience/knowledge on cave diving? It’s something I’ve always wanted to do and there’s a great one near my location that’s barely been explored.

All I really want to know about is the gas mixtures for tanks. I’ve already bought all the gear besides that, with it arriving before the end of this weekend hopefully so that I can go on my own next weekend.

Breh. Cave diving is the last fawking thing you want to be a dilettante at. 
Certain death awaits and that's before the spergs here start giving you bad and misleading advice. 
You'd better not play with that unless you're cold as ice and have an extremely experienced dive partner that's willing to risk their life for yours.

I've never dived but I enjoy watching diving disaster videos on youtube. My takeaway is: expect to turn retarded the moment you enter the water. Seriously. It seems like people drop 40 IQ pts the moment they get in a cave. That's how you get people going too far, running out of air, panicking, etc. So instead of thinking you'll outsmart the ocean, which you won't, instead just assume you'll act like a drunk idiot and plan around that. Stack everything in your favor. The big killer, aside from just staying down too long, is silt blocking your vision. Like 50% of all the diving disasters end with this. So again, assume it'll happen to you, be ready, and never never let go of your safety line.

Are you even certified scuba at the open water level? If you can't answer that question are you aren't even remotely close. I should also mention besides being a technical and physically demanding sport its also a rich mans sport only, the costs in gear and training easily run into the tens of thousands.
You have to be at minimum a technical diver before even considering overhead cave diving.
What did you even buy?

wtgs, its not a sport at all you just "jump into", not even experienced cave divers go into unexplored caves

I bet your the type of person who fall for the, " U GONNA DIE!!! unless you give me sheckles for DiverStine™ certification" meme.

People are so pozzed, many legitimately believe they will die if they go off trail on a hike without multiple (((Courses))).

OP here.
>>2570544
No diving partner, I’ve been living in isolation the last few years so don’t have anyone else to do it with and I’m going alone. I’ve been scuba diving on vacation once but I was only in the water for 5 mins because they gave me a faulty mask that kept filling with water.

>>2570565
My theory is that people who die doing things like this are either A) retarded or B) over experienced and think they don’t need to take certain safety precautions. I have neither of these problems since I’m not retarded and have zero experience.

>>2570571
Read above but no I’m not scuba certified. 
>what did you even buy?
I can post a general list if you like, like I said I have everything I need besides the tanks because the only thing I’m not certain on is the gas mixtures. I also want a 100% nitrous tank that if things go really wrong I can just suck on and suffocate. I’m aiming to go deep and explore further than anyone else has attempted so if you know anything about depth levels and the gas mixtures that would be a big help
>>2570583
Oh no! Anyway… moving on.

>>2570623
This is the correct attitude. All you need is a brain and some resources and you can learn to do anything yourself.

Cavediving seems like something that would lead to my untimely death, so I'll stick to watching videos about it on youtube.

Ultimately, every person who drowns that way must end up thinking: "What the fuck am I doing down here?" as they die.

Correct, absolutely fucking spot on. So with that knowledge in mind are you going to choose to be Retarded, or choose to do it propprerly? 

Since you think you're not retarded, what kind of mechanicall knowledge do you have currently? To cave dive you're going to have to learn to make triple redundancy systems to carry not only on yourself as you dive, but in your ecosystems so you don't get bends. It's extremely complicated stuff. You need to be an engineer to do it safely.

245m deep dive.

You should also go caving first, get used to the risks of being in caves before you add the water part.
--- 2570735
>>2570521 (OP)
If you don't know which mixture to use, don't already own the gear, and haven't even used it, you should not go cave diving AT ALL.

Alongside that, there's MOD calculations, multiple cylinders with different mixtures (nitrox, trimix) for different points in the dive, and probably the most important thing... the blue hole is fucking boring. 

It looks infinitely better from a drone's point of view than at depth, so just don't bother with that particular one. Very few reference points as well, so as a beginner (which I assume you are based on the questions) you'll have a hard time controlling your buoyancy. There's better, more beginner friendly, and frankly WAY prettier caves out there. Don't be a dumbass who became a statistic.

Please list your gear, 

I would highly recommend taking a SSI basic open water scuba course. Most of it is online self-paced learning and its not super expensive. It will get you the fundamentals of diving, understanding depth and 
To answer your question about gas mixtures and diving, basic open circuit scuba w divers just use regular old compressed air that's at a diver standard. some people and mostly commercial divers use surface supplied air from a compressor topside but there are some recreational "hooka" systems out there.
There's Nitrox (not to be confused with Nitrous oxide), also called enriched air which is just a trade name, which all it is, is air that has a higher % of oxygen than regular air (which is 21% o2) commonly at 32% O2 but you can set it to as high as you want with the recreational limit at 44% O2. Anything higher is considered technical. The reason you would use higher o2 is that it increases your no decompression "bottom time" and reduces your deco time (if you have to decompress), but it also reduces your max operating depth. The higher the O2 the shallower your max depth is with %100 O2 being something like 20ft. Violating this can cause you to have convulsions and death vai drowning because o2 becomes toxic at depth. The term used for this is partial pressure of oxygen which for the human body the PO2 is 1.6 and is physiological hard limitation. At aprox. 250ft even air (21% O2) becomes toxic so you have to use hypoxic mixes and that's where trimix comes into play

Trimix is basically any mixture of Helium with any other gas something for great depths a hypoxic level of o2. Reason you would use Trimix is because it reduces nitrogen narcosis (basically getting high at depth) since you are replacing nitrogen with helium. These days its rarely used outside of re-breathers (which recycle gases) because Helium is now super expensive.
There's a lot to known, recommend reading the US navy dive manual too.

Also
This is guy is trolling >>2570623 There is common sense and defiantly over bloated certification cash grabs that i.e PADI does but Scuba diving let alone cave diving is not something you can self-teach yourself at least in a uncontrolled environment. Sure the pioneers did but again they did it in controlled environments (i.e a pool). Cave diving is like the mount Everest of of basic scuba diving. you just don't "do it" without experience (learn to crawl before you walk).

>I want to cave dive with no experience. 
Don't, but If you're hell bent on doing it anyways, go with a buddy, bring a travel line with distance markers (white ring for 10 feet yellow for 50, red for 100, so 170' would be one red one yellow two white) on a reel so it doesn't turn into a rope monster. glow sticks, light and backup light, spare bottles to stage on the way back, and don't go in very far your first dive. If you have the money, consider a surface supplied rig like picrel so you can follow your hose back

Op just wants to kill himself, he has no idea what his doing. Surface supply won't get you far in a cave also a major entanglement hazard.

I wouldn't consider it a major entanglement hazard with a good tender
--- 2571655
>>2571397
Surface supplied isn't really a thing for cave diving. Its a risk damaging the cave and it's often too constricting for the environment. It is done like in some really special applications, like going through a sump but that's a high end rarity.

Most caver divers roll rebreathers.

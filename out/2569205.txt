Larpers dont want you to know this but you can block freeze fresh meat and keep it from spoiling for a good 3 days in well insulated thermos container. 
You can pretty much take anything on an overnighter if youre not afraid of the weight/bulk.

I like to take tofu too
high protein, although a bit watery (only ~150kcal/100g) and thus relatively heavy

It’s crazy to me how these have exploded in popularity over the past ~5 years, considering this same design has been around for two decades. People who do go out understand the nuance of varying weather, while people who don’t simply theorycraft worst case scenarios (muh hard shell).

what are you talking about?
onions protein has an excellent amino acid composition and is one of the best absorbed proteins

and then not even talking about Gluconeogenesis
which is pretty slow for onions so your body can actually use the protein you eat instead of just making more carbohydrates out of it

or the fact that Bioavalibility is a highly criticized concept itself 
and there is currently more of a "is probably wrong" consensus in science (outside of your /fit/ness bro circles)

This whole thread is bait and you're a faggot for bumping this thrad instead of saging like others have

Yeah, you’re one of the people who doesn’t understand. Not every rain shower is a downpour in January. Not every piece of land is perfectly shaded with a thick tree canopy. Or maybe you don’t know how popular they’ve become because you’re out of touch, which is fine.

I remember when someone tried to pass off a torn Osprey bag as their own. It was a picture they found on Reddit from like 8 years ago with a broken YKK zipper.

>>2570129
The r/ buy it for life one? I remember that. I thought it was just a redditor with osprey, who posted about it because they had used it. 8 years is a long time so they probably only had the photo. I remember thinking "Huh so redditors do use them." Never interupt an idiot making a mistake I guess. Point proven.

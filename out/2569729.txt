Why are they all fat fucking Brits? And why do the Brit’s act like they have any outdoors to go to? I’ve been to England it’s a treeless shithole

People seem to like them for some reason. I've seen a few in woods near me and they don't seem to do any harm.

>London a forest
Only because of all the parks, its still a depressing shithole, most of our "forests" are non native

Paul is comfycore, why you hating on him.
He covers the campmaxxing style of /out/. And there's really nothing else to do in Britain with its terrain so they give us the sit around, sleep and muck about gear

Technically, the "London Plane" is thought to be a hybrid between the oriental plane (Platanus orientalis), native to Asia and the Balkans, and the American plane or "Sycamore" (P. occidentalis). BTW, "sycamore," which literally means "fig-mulberry" in Greek, originally referred to a variety of fig (Ficus sycomorus, the "sycamore" of the Bible), and now in British English usually refers to the sycamore maple or mock-plane (Acer pseudoplatanus), also called the great or Scottish maple (in contradistinction to the much smaller field maple, which is more common in England).

They are kinda shit now. A few years ago his reviews were pretty straightforward nowadays he's obsessed with these dumb larp situations and dramatic campouts.

Wet windy British moorland is actually great testing ground for outdoor gear.

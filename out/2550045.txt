you walk into abandoned places
>any types of locations i should start with?
abandoned places near you

what the fuck is wrong with zoomers man, rub two of your brain cells together for a second and think of how retarded the question you're asking is. there's nothing difficult or spiritual or mental about urban exploration, you just walk around. no one's going to shoot you on sight unless you walk into a drug den, or nigger. the worst thing that happens in most cases is security or police show up and ask you to leave
--- 2550052

--- 2550053

if it's abandoned there isn't security, and they won't do shit except ask you to leave. start with exploring a coffin, how fucking stupid do you have to be to ask "where do i go to look at stuff?"

^Ignore this faggot
First of all, get boots that don´t get pierced by nails and glass. Extremely important.
Then, get an asbestos mask. This may sound overkill, but if you explore some half rotting, half collapsed building that hasn´t been touched in years, you´re gonna create a lot of dust, and things may shift, causing asbestos to be set free.
It doesn´t take a lot of asbestos to fuck you up. I´m not saying get a full-on gas mask, but get a 3M classified for asbestos. Shouldn´t be more than 20 bucks.
Then, the biggest factor on how much fun you´re gonna have, is where you live. If you live in a shithole, there´s a good chance you can see 10 abandonned buildings just by looking outside of your window.
If you live in a 1st world country, you´ll probably have to find a community.
There´s also Google-Maps community maps, with thousands of locations, but you gotta have connections for people to give you permission to view those, because in 1st world countries, the urbex folks are all paranoid, because of vandalism and subhuman graffitti niggers.
I used to be on facebook communities, but barely anyone uses facebook anymore, so I don´t know how it´s done now.
You also might wanna have wellies, and in really shady structures a hard-hat.
Also, tell people close to you where you´re going.
IF you live in Germany, I can give you a couple of locations.

thanks for the advice anon. i do have have decent boots, just no gas mask. i'm not in germany though i'm in canada. i looked online to see if i could find any local urbex groups but didn't find much.

Other anon, I guess you're talking about that urbex elite photo Databank. Do you have any cool locations in brandenburg? Been going to lots of military bases and want to go to Kaserne kummersdorf next but there seems to be a lot of activity around there. Do you know anything as big as the one in Luckenwalde but with just as lax security?
--- 2551172
>>2550723
To the West-South-West of Brandeburg, there´s some kind of Halbinsel, and there seem to be 6 different spots just there.
I´ll just send you the Maps-Image, because they are so close together, that you should be able to find them. I don´t know if they´re all still active though, some of them aren´t updated regularly.
The place is called Kirchmöser, but I guess if you live near Brandeburg, you may know it already.
No idea about the quality of those places either. With those maps, you never really know.

every city has storm drains. every industrial area has abandoned buildings. look at infiltration.org for inspiration, they're from toronto
--- 2551667
If you live in a deindustrialized shithole like I do, a good way to start finding places is to use Google maps satellite view and look along railroads. The website abandonedrails.com is a great respurce for US railroad locations. Within approximately 15 min of looking around the outskirts of any medium sized city I can find one. Once you think that youve found a place, try to see it in person before you dive in. Holes in fences, boards on windows, old graffiti, lack of vehicles, and overgrown vegetation are good signs that a place is thoroughly abandonded. Picrel is from a town that I've never been to and randomly chose (Erie Pennsylvania) which I found in about 10 minutes. IMO the best way to stay safe is to take a trusted friend with you. GL and have fun out there

there's a steel factory near Krefeld or düsseldorf I went to in 2010. plenty of scaling or climbing activity. However I think they added a movie theater inside the old factory. Still worth a visit.

Ever had any issues with homeless people squatting?
--- 2552516
>>2552165
Fairly often you'll sew signs of squatters like mattresses and litter in abandonded industrial areas, but running into people is exceptionally rare. It's only happened to me twice. Once saw a guy just watching us from a window, a very old man whoshouted at us to go away while we were in a parking lot looking for a way to get inside. We just turned around and left without any issue. The last thing that the types of people who live in abonded buildings want is to be seen and kicked out, so they really just try to avoid everyone. You're probably more likely to get assaulted by a crack addict in a gas station parking lot than inside some old factory.
--- 2552535
>>2550045 (OP)
Start looking around for abandoned places when you are out and about, theres probably more than you think. For me, especially old factories were easy to find. Be aware that a lot of places have been trashed by young people/homeless. A lot of glass on the floor, i would always go wearing a thick soled shoe. Also drug needles. Thick padded running shoes and clothing makes you look more like a guy that took a wrong turn or just "got curious" and had a look in the building while out running rather than someone dangerous. You want to be mindful of safety, bring flashlight and phone to call for help, be careful what you step on as wooden floors can be rotten through or stairs can collapse. Be aware of your enviroment. But usually its okay. Ive never met any, but theres been homeless people sleeping at most of the ones ive seen at some point so far, its a decent sign in some ways because then the place is truly abandoned, you´d want to make sure that there isnt anyone comming to check on the building. The asbestos advice from the other anon is probably a good idea.

I enjoy urbex (especially abandoned malls) and have followed various related YouTube channels for years, and you know what I've noticed? Unless it's an amusement park, urbex happens inside of a building--literally indoors--in 99% of cases. Why the fuck are you posting about it on /out/doors? Do city idiots think that any venue not in a cubicle, apartment, or restaurant counts as "outside"?

This. I got in on a Facebook group that did paid trips. A girl roped me into it. From there I was able to meet people and stop paying. That shit is gay. They'd organize shit to justify the cost but I never wanted that in the first place. 

Do the mask. Be paranoid about danger. I had a friend fall through a factory floor that looked good, but it wasn't. He fucked up his leg and we had to drag him out of there. Be careful. This shit is as dangerous if not more than exploring abandoned mines if you act stupid.

honest to god, people gatekeep so fucking hard it's stupid as fuck. 
The sentiment is to keep people from destroying beautiful abandoned places, which is understandable, but it's still fucking stupid.
From what I've heard:
- post proof of any expeditions you go on to give yourself credibility and ask around
- use google for your location
- use google maps and follow rivers/train tracks
- use wikimapia
- join random urbex discords from tiktok urbexers and ask around
- DON'T FUCKING DESTROY THE PLACES
best of luck to you

The best places I've found, I just pay attention while I drive around and look for ladders, anywhere there's graffiti (means there's a way up), and yeah just peel your eyes and look around sometimes it's just obvious.
Ignore the gatekeeping seethe virgins, this is a hobby that should be spread, just not to autistic middle school edgelords.

I'm this anon >>2550723 so I looked into it after you send the location. I wasn't convinced at first but after I looked at it from street view it looked pretty dope. Thanks for the recommendation.
If you got any more I'd be happy to look into this as well. But I'm probably not going to go there within the next two weeks.

>>2557652
Well there was a trash yard with a bunch of cars close by so I think they just used it to store their boat.
I also would have liked to take that door but I'm on foot. The place also looked like there were gypsies living there so I just didn't enter cuz I don't want any trouble with them.

How can I find new places to explore? My friends aren't interested in urbex and I generally don't like meeting new people. Are there any good sites or forums for abandoned places?
--- 2559577
Does anyone know if there is a way to search Google Maps for places marked "permanently closed"? This would be a really good way to find locations.

>>2559036
Satellite maps. Check newspapers for closed businesses and the like. Pick up on patterns: where places typically get abandoned where you live.

I've been to a few that were closed or gone completely so better get moving if you wanna see 'em.

any location you can find info online sucks or doesn't exist anymore.
people either ransack those spots or the owners shut it down because of the traffic.
learn to find your own spots or meet someone local who will show you shit. learn your area's history. that's a good starting point for finding out what kinds of places might exist abandoned and be worth checking out. google earth is pretty nifty too.

And with few exceptions abandoned structures, at least the ones that do get popular are going to be demolished within a few years especially as more urbexfags catch on about them. I understand the mentality of not outright destroying anything but the obsession with leaving everything exactly as it is is wishful thinking when you tend to know this place won't exist for long. Though there are certainly places that demolition is highly unlikely to happen to. What gets me more is when a place is already graffitiid and vandalized in numerous ways but people are still like 'be extra careful'.

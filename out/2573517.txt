Anyone else insanely afraid of open water?

Sharks, snapping turtles, saltwater Crocs, giant squid 

Nothing more terrifying to me than jumping into the sea from a boat

The ocean is scary
But it is cool

Nah bro we hunt gators down here, it's quite something to see. Down in Louisiana they hunt and eat snapping turtles, the Cajuns, like the Indigenous people have done for a long time.

It's forests, fields, rivers, lakes, shores, swamps, and mountains. Some people do deep sea fishing in the gulf for bigass fish and sea creatures, it's an adventure and it's solid money. Some people find this kinda stuff to be exciting and not scary, fortune favors the bold.

The open sea is like the open road really, there is a lot of possibility

There's seeing stuff like OP posted on your screen, you see it on a screen

Then there's really living it and being alive like it's your last year on Earth

I didn't mean on a boat but maybe I was unclear given the webm. I meant actually getting in the water. 
Nothing scary about fishing off a 25ft Yamaha

You gotta live it

Whatever bro, I die then I die.
Fear robs more lives than all the threats in the world combined.
be cautious and not stupid and you'll probably be fine most of your life
also don't romanticize nature
nature is metal as fuck
btw fuck the game warden
if I see a buck I'm going to blast it before it gores me tearing my organs out

I understand you completely, the vast expanse of the unknown, what horrors and leviathans await beyond the darkness and so on

I'm just saying that you should face the unknown with confidence because that's all you can do, if you're fucked you're fucked, but if you've got balls and you're prepared, you'll make it through. Fight or flight, some have a personality towards fight, some towards flight.

Bucks are pretty docile even friendly if you are giving them corn as bait, but they are full of delicious steaks and sausages

listen, I don't care if an animal is within a safe distance and it even nice to observe them, but the second I think it's going to charge at me and it comes to close I'm not hesitating thinking about "le cute little bambi"

Yes, my whole family are sailors, but I can't jump from the pier. I have no problem in lakes, though, even big ones

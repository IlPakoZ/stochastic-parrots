I was part of the California Conservation Corps (CCC) back in July 2019- August 2020. Easily the greatest year of my life. I was out in Northern California in a small town called Fortuna in Humboldt County. We did all sort of projects including habitat restorations, invasive plant removal, fire restoration, chainsaw work, and a few others. I did a bunch of volunteer work and stuff outside of work and it really gave me a real sense of discipline and a need for hard work I never had within my 20 years of life (at the time). It really changed my outlook on life and helped me for the better. I miss it everyday

answe the damn question
--- 2566037
>>2565937
How are the people? Do you find its easy to make friends on the crew? Does everyone usually get a long? Its a lot of time to spend in the backcountry with random people
--- 2566148
>>2565908 (OP)
I was gonna apply this year and didn't
How was the work? Just digging firelines and such or were there some actually interesting things?

I might still next year, but debating it with a seasonal forester position

I was with the California Conservation Corps, it's probably different in other states. The work was varied enough to avoid boredom but some jobs just sucked, like pouring and finishing 1500 cubic yards of concrete in the middle of summer, or being the ground crew for CalTrans tree guys on 30 miles of I-5. Luckily, there's plenty of floods to sandbag and wildfires to mop up. Mostly, it seemed we were the go-to trail building crew for a large area in Northern California, which suited me fine. I also went backcountry to work on trails in Yosemite, and I was assigned to a crew that worked on a coastal nature preserve. It's definitely worth the low pay.

The crews I was on were tight. Pretty much everybody got along well, if there was a problem child they'd be canned with a quickness.

Same, wish I did it more instead of chasing better paying jobs but I'm in my late 20's now. I was in NCCC in 2017-2018. We bounced from Northern Cali doing trail maintenance and post-fire restoration, to Bozeman, MT helping to build housing, and then back to Northern Cali to do prescribed fires and project work around a forest.
Gave me a great worth ethic instead of gaming all day and showed me parts of the US I would never have seen since I never traveled anywhere as a kid. It gave me all the certifications to work a couple seasons in wildland firefighting.
I recommend it to everyone.
>>2566148
I'd say if you have any interest in doing conservation corps despite the low pay, I would recommend that before a seasonal forestry position. There's also AmeriCorps St Louis which is an Emergency Response Team - less backcountry type work but you'll still get opportunity to do wildland fire.
These programs are really fun when you're young but if you're older and like being treated like an adult/having more freedom, then I'd recommend just going seasonal forestry.

>>2566330
Do you think there is better opportunity for career advancement working a seasonal position for the forest service or doing one of those conservation corps positions? I was going to join a crew for American Conservation Experience but then I applied to forest service jobs and got a ton of offers and they pay better.
--- 2566443
>>2565925
Damn. I did a season with Southwest CC. 100% dudes. Other crews got luckier.

I built like 100 yards of the AZT, so yay I guess.
--- 2566447
>>2566363
Not that anon, but several of my crew immediately hired on with the NFS as wildland firefighters after leaving the corps. Another hired on as a fish and game warden despite no college and no law enforcement experience. So it seems to be a good way to move to a different agency.
--- 2566449
>>2566443
Every bit helps.
--- 2566837
>>2566363
Way more advancement in the Forest Service and related agencies. Start out as a seasonal or look into the Apprentice program to move into a permanent position. Conservation corps experience and networking definitely transfers over though - a lot of federal agencies sponsor them and hire people from them. I met so many BLM and Forest Service employees in NCCC and got references and tips on applying.
The federal agencies have been hurting for numbers lately so you're almost guaranteed a job if you apply on USAJobs and get through resume screening.
Search for park ranger, trail maintenance, or 0462 for Forestry Tech and Fire positions.

Sounds like a dream. I wish this was a possibility in Europe.

>>2566837
Yeah I did get a position on a botany crew in a forest. I'll be treating invasive plants mostly. I got offer many trails and fire positions but they don't seem worth it for career prospects. From reading online, it seems like its hard to get a permanent position in federal agencies. I think I could have an easier time getting something for the state, or a private company, or a small park district eventually

It looks fun, but I'm too old apparently. Why the age limit?
--- 2566907

Because these programs are set up as a way to direct urban kids toward a somewhat more meaningful existence.

>>2565908 (OP)
What kind of gear do you recommend for conservation corps? Cheaper stuff to easily replace or expensive more durable stuff? For example, have cheap rain gear(frogg toggs) that I barely use because I dont hike in the rain. I'm assuming now that we will be working in the rain so these might not hold up. Should I spend a lot on a more dependable rain set or will they get torn up? Any specific rain gear recommendations for backcountry work?
--- 2567159

Boots suitable for wildland firefighting such as Whites or Wesco, or Red Wing Loggers if you won't be on fires. Plan on spending at least $400 for boots, anything less will be more expensive in the long run because you'll just end up buying a quality boot after destroying your cheap boots in the first two months. Do not buy any boot with gore tex or other waterproof liner, it'll leak within a month anyway. 

Rain gear: PVC or heavy duty PU coated bibs and rain jacket. You'll spend a few hundred on a decent set but again, if you cheap out you'll destroy them in a day of clearing brambles or brush, or serious trail work. 

Pants: Loose jeans or poly-cotton outdoor work pants, but no poly allowed on a fire because it'll melt to your skin. You'll be issued Nomex fire gear for fires. You'll also be issued a helmet and maybe goggles but bring sunglasses. 

Leather work gloves, whatever fits. You'll need a few pair. 

You'll need a pack to carry your rain gear, water, lunch, first aid, and stuff like chainsaw bibs, extra saw chains, and files. It'll get oily, greasy, muddy and generally beat up so don't bring an expensive pack, but make sure it can take a beating. 

You'll need sunscreen, lots of NSAIDS, a blister kit, lots of good socks, etc. I'd bring a fleece jacket, no gore tex or other lightweight stuff. Take care of your boots and they'll take care of you. Also, get fit enough to carry a shovel in one hand and a McLeod in the other with 30 pounds on your back up two miles of steep trail every day. Do lots of pushups, crunches, and run two miles in the morning and two miles in the evening. 

I'm sure there are conservation corps programs that are designed for today's special snowflakes but why bother? The fun shit is always the hardest.

I wont be doing trail work. I got on crew as a "habitat restoration member" It sounds like I will be spraying invasives and helping with plant and wild life surveys. So I will still be hiking in rugged terrain and the hitches are long, 8 days on 6 days off. No construction or fire or anything. 

Would you still suggest heavy duty bibs and a jacket over a gore tex rain suit for a job like that? If so, whats a good durable rain suit that can be packed relatively easy? I'm assuming I dont need to carry a weeks worth of food since we use a truck or mules to pack stuff in so I was planning on using an old 32 liter pack. I have to pack my sleep system, clothes, toiletries, and everything else besides food. I think some bibs and a jacket like you're suggesting might be too bulky. 

I was planning on using my Salomon GTX 4d boots. They seem good enough.

Conservation corps is know for terrible leadership, why haven't your skills gotten you a job somewhere else?
--- 2567237
>>2567178
Gotcha. I guess it depends on how brutal the work is and what the climate is; I'd talk to the corps about what they recommend and go with that. If you'll be exposed to gnarly summer thundershowers at a higher altitude I'd still go with a waterproof PVC or PU coated jacket (and maybe rain bibs or pants) but in a lightweight design -- roll it up and strap it to your pack. Once you get to spike camp and shed a lot of weight, carrying heavy rain gear on the daily marches to the restoration area won't be as bad as you think. I definitely wouldn't bring gore tex (or any other hiking raingear) if you bring PVC or PU raingear. Your GTX boots will probably be fine; if they start breaking down you'll have enough time to get some new ones. Sounds like you're gonna have fun!

What was the work culture like and what we're your co-workers like politically/ socially.
Specifically I am curious if your co-workers were a bunch of gay hippies? down to earth folks? apolitical outdoorsmen? alt-right naturalists? Etc.
--- 2575289
>>2575121
The work culture was great, everyone worked hard, and like I said, if anyone was a slack ass they'd be booted. Politically, people kept their mouths shut unless it was a conversation between two or three people after work. Some of my co-workers were very liberal, some conservative, but there wasn't any polarization like we see today. I was (and still am) an environmentalist; I imagine it would be weird to join a conservation corps and not care about the earth. We were all pretty down to earth, no serious weirdos. 

This was a long time ago in the Bay Area. Nowadays it's probably a bunch of ultra liberal retards and trannies.

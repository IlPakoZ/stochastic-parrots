If you are close enough to existing population to build high density suburbs, it wasn't that /out/ to begin with, do you "camp" in "campgrounds" with sewer hookups and then complain about the RVs too?

rural and 'out' are NOT the same thing.

iowa or nebraska can have rural areas that are 100% corn field for miles and miles, but there's not a whit of nature anywhere near btw.

rural oregon can have forested wilderness 30 miles from a large-ish town

This Anon is right. If you’re close enough to a city for one of these to be built, then you’re in the exurbs. 
>identical houses bad!
It’s a NPC containment zone. Do you really want the people who live there competing with you in a bidding war for a classical craftsman-style cottage or that awesome 1920’s farmhouse? I’m hope they build more of these places just to keep the normies away from me.

This board considers literally anything done outside to be an outdoor recreation. There are currently two active threads about smoking outside. 

Janitors who are transsexuals would actually be a step up from the drooling retard eunuchs we have.

I live in Palm Beach County, FL and it breaks my heart seeing all the rezoning notices and master community developments slowly washing over the Agricultural Preserve. It’s a catch 22 for me because I hate that so many people are moving here and I loved the rural farms of the county when growing up in the area, but housing is incredibly unaffordable and any stock like this helps—but unfortunately they’re usually all SFH’s and 55+ communities for kike boomers.

Like someone else said here, there wasn’t much /out/ to do in the area in the first place because it was all private farmland, but it’s sad I’ll never own a South Florida homestead with chickens and growing exotic tropical fruits. These HOA’s would never allow it. I’ll throw a fit though if they cross into what’s left of the glades. And I wouldn’t be surprised if that happens since the state and counties of Florida are pretty much owned by the like developers. They would keep building until there isn’t a single blade of saw grass left in the state.

Thats true about nebraska but come to the Driftless Area of Eastern Iowa and say it isn't /out/

i wasn't saying the entire state of iowa or nebraska were devoid of out opportunities anon. just using them as examples of areas with a lot of 'rural' low pop areas, but private farmland.

Maybe? Dunno i live pretty far out in the woods myself; all the land out here is zoned f2 /f1; the urban growth boundary prevents it from rezoned and turned into a subdivision

Urban growth boundaries don’t mean shit when the governments keeps expanding it
--- 2576123
>>2576120
true, but it does present at least some kind of hurdle to greedy land developers.
where i live (lane county OR) the county and state are all very anti-development. they'd sooner build unlimited apartments and convert neighborhoods with SFH's into to section 8 favelas inside city limits than allow more sprawl.

i really don't understand the pro immigration people, it's pants on head retarded and not sustainable.

Lulz. Farmers in WI farm the shit out of the driftless region. There's fields on top of any bluff the can manage to get a tractor up on to.

So heckin crazy the sierra club 180'd on it's immigration stance and now thinks unlimited suburban sprawl is unavoidable. Our population should be shrinking but Jews insist on importing 1 billion indians and mexicans so they don't loose any shekels.

With my friends I'm just antisemitic, but with less familiar people I frame it as anti-colonial. Or I just laugh at them and ask them why they're willing to use humans as resources just to get lower grocery store prices.

Stop pretending to be retarded just to fit some contrarian niche. We all know what outdoor recreation is. Smoking isn’t a part of it.

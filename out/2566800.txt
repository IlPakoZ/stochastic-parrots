Caught me a couple of stock trout yesterday. And by a couple I mean 7, but they're stock trout, they're not exactly hard to catch. They were loving the Mepps spinners. Thinking on targeting SMB tomorrow.

thoughts on a zodias?
--- 2567073
>>2567072
my two baitcasters are a zodias (7'2 MH-F) and a rebellion (6'10 MH-R). Zodias for topwater/pitching/flipping and trolling deep for large pike/musky. The rebellion for cranksbaits, swimjigs, basically everything else. Also a Med-Lite St. Croix Premier spinner for ned rigs, texas rigs, weightless worms, etc. I think Rebellion and Zodias are the best bang for your buck multi purpose rods on the market right now. Can't go wrong with either although if you want to spend less St. Croix triumphs and Fenwick HMG's are great and more than capable. They are my back ups.
--- 2567074
>>2567073
was looking at the 7' light spinning for neds/keitechs
considered the levante too but seems people have bad things to say about dealing with their warranty process
--- 2567075
>>2567074
I've had great experiences with shimano, daiwa and st. croix and tend to avoid everything else besides fenwick for affordable/back up options. Fenwick also has good warranties for many rods (HMG is lifetime) yet the service isn't the greatest, sometimes a long wait for a replacement which is why I like them for back ups.
--- 2567079

i'm usually a st croix/fenwick guy but wanted to branch out into something a bit more high end as i like to finesse fish

Hey anons, I have a river running through my land with lots of bream and bass and catfish in it, I want to eat more fish to be more self sufficient but I'm a bit paranoid about all the crap in rivers like farm runoff and plastics etc, the river comes out of a reservoir and it's not a very big river, should I be concerned about increasing my fish intake?
--- 2567086
>>2567081
should be able to get a water test kit and correlate it to accumulation in fish
generally stay away from really large fish as the bioaccummulation is worse
--- 2567089
>>2567081
in Ontario they have suggested eating guidelines, i primarily fish on a large inland lake (with very little cottages) and they have a guideline that says roughly like 2-4 walleye a month, 2-3 pike a month, 10 crappie a month, etc. The fear for my area isn't even about runoff pollution it's about acidic rain. What you're targeting also matters. If in doubt younger fish should always be safer
--- 2567125
I’m going to throw swimbaits and nobody can stop me
--- 2567127
how shit are eva grips
--- 2567131

Good ones are fine and they are better than cork if you’re gonna just leave your rods in the weather in your boat or whatever. 

That said, I hate them.

It's not hard. The hard part is fighting yourself from putting down your swimbait shit and going back to conventional lures when you don't get bit after ~30 minutes. 

If you can fish a spinnerbait, you can fish a soft swimbait. If you can fish a crankbait, you can fish a crankdown swimbait. If you can fish a jerkbait, you can fish a glide bait. If you can fish a whopper plopper, you can fish a wake swimbait.
--- 2567152
I need a good way to store jigs with trailers. Mixed plastic types including elaztech stuff. Any suggestions?
--- 2567157
>>2567138
Striped bass and LMB. Pretty much fish them anywhere you’d fish any other lure. Whenever I fish swimbaits I make sure it’s the only thing I bring, it takes dedication and consistency just like the other anon said. When it does produce it’s usually a good fish
--- 2567158
>>2567132
How they feel. I have a bit of tactile sensitivity, and the feel of EVA Foam makes my whole forearm just lock right the fuck up. I first had this problem with a little pencil grips that my first grade teacher gave me to try and get me to stop holding a pencil with a death grip.
There’s no good reason, I just can’t deal with it.
--- 2567172
>>2567127
cork feels and looks much better than foam. foam starts getting dried out and bad feeling after a year. I don't understand why some high-end expensive rods still use foam instead of winn grips or cork. at least you can maintain cork.
--- 2567173

I'm almost completely new to fishing. Should I jump right into fly fishing or get a spinning rod and reel first? Both seem fun but most of the fish around here are trout so I want to fish what's actually available.
--- 2567346

I would see what other people are fishing at the spots you want to go to. Doesn't really matter either way but better to get a good start fishing at places where you choice of gear works good.

>>2567333
Fly fishing has a higher entry cost and skill floor, but when done properly catches more fish. Other forms of lure fishing as well as bait fishing are cheaper to get into and easier to do well, and target a wider variety of fish, but will be outperformed by competent fly fishing. If you intend to target trout exclusively, I'd say go for fly fishing, especially if you'll primarily be fishing in rivers or streams where flies are at their best and bait/lures at their worst.
--- 2567375
>>2567346
>>2567351
Thanks. There is a local fly fishing store in my town, so I'll ask them about it tomorrow. Probably should have asked actual professionals first but I thought I'd ask here first before committing to a course of action.
--- 2567378
>>2567373
How much higher is the entry cost? Will I be able to get a decent start with say, $250? I don't plan on targeting exclusively trout, but in my local area literally every stocked body of water has trout.

Of course i will only be going for perch and crappie as everything else is out of season. I will NOT target bass, walleye, pike or musky. Not me. Law abiding citizen
--- 2567572
>>2567564
Wax will help. I would try it before I resorted to turning the rod into a 1 piece.
--- 2567577
If i was going to buy 1 fly rod right now with the intent to purchase 1 more next year what would you go with? Everywhere i look recommends a 5 wt although if i bought a 5 wouln't i go up to 8 or down to 3 next year? Would a 6 this year and a 4 next year make more sense?
--- 2567580
>>2567577
what are you targeting?
--- 2567583
>>2567580
I plan on targeting everything from brook/brown/rainbows to smallmouth/largemouth and salmon/steelhead
--- 2567586
>>2567577
I would get a 5 wt to start. You'll have a better idea of what you need after you've fished for a year so don't worry about that not.

i'm noticing a lot of the same lengths and actions/powers between some brands, are these just the same blanks being used but their separate hardware added?
--- 2567636
>>2567378
You'll be just fine with $250
That'll get you an Echo base combo, a couple leaders, some tippet, a fly box, and some flies.

>>2567466
No, just a weeb 
>>2567467
Fly fishing is for homos, tenkara is for weebs 
>>2567577
If ypu want your first with intent to add more later get a 4 weight and learn to fly fish small stuff (panfish, dink bass, trout) then add an 8 weight for pike, bass, carp, saltwater, etc. As you fish more with those two combos you'll figure out if you want to add a 2, 6, or 10 weight fly rod to your arsenal.
>>2567583
Yes definitely start on a 4 then add an 8 later 
>>2567587
Just catch and arouse a male duck and use his penis, the lightest cork screw is the one you don't have to carry. If you don't like that option amd already carry a multi tool just get a drywall screw, screw that in to the cork, then grab it with the pliers and pull.
--- 2567638
>>2567603
sometimes... but usually not. the reality is that they aren't the same blanks, they just slap on a generic rating that doesn't even feel the same between rods. you can pick up two rods that have the same rating, and they don't feel the same. ratings can be off by a noticeable amount.

Presenting babby's first babby spotty.
Finally went bay side fishing again after skunked here two years ago, and haven't fished much in general the past two years. Beautifully sunny on the coast and overcast across the bay. Mostly wanted to focus on my casting so I kept my expectations low on actually catching anything. Three casts in, the spool dumps a bunch of line and is a tangled mess. Spent a couple of minutes seeing if I could salvage the shit but ultimately cut it off and retied. No problems with it after, so perhaps I had it overfilled?
Was throwing a 1/8oz ball head jig with a 3" Reins Rockvibe Shad. I'm a bad judge of distance, but there wasn't much in terms of castability, maybe 30 yards at best. Supposedly the Cays are pretty shallow so I wanted some distance to get into deeper water. Didn't end up mattering too much since I got this guy pretty shallow to my surprise. Bumped up to 10g as the tide went out for more distance and caught one more dinker before heading home.
--- 2567816

Pike, bass, musly, trout, cod, salmon, literally anything that can eat something of that size, 10cm pike eat 15cm swimbaits

Anyone have experience with Lucky brand fish finders / depth finders ? The fact that they make standalone units that don't require a smartphone really peaks my interest, only people making these that aren't a boat unit or pair with a smart phone as far as I know.

Just get put gear then, you can get more than enough for that amount
--- 2567837
>>2567378
>>2567827
Your setup generally isnt that important, the bait is. You can fish a broom shaft with the correct shit in the end and catch fish, i have. Having great and expensive gear just means a better and more accurate fishing experience. For a beginner literally anything will do. Literally, so dont stress it at all
--- 2567914
how do I catch these niggas? they don't follow lures or worms and are a plague in my zone now because their predaintators are dying

Going to Cabo on vacation, going to have plenty of time to fish. The only rod I’ll be able to travel with is a 6’6” ML 5 piece though. I’m bringing some soft plastic swimbaits and jerkbaits, a few small spinnerbaits and hard bodied jerkbaits. I have zero experience surf fishing, what am I in for
--- 2568223
>>2568143
It depends more on what type of fly you're tying than it being barbless. That hook you posted is good for beaded nymphs

I finally got a nymphing dedicated rig so I can be twice as effective on the river, also got a lot of other new gear over the off season im excited to try with opener coming up

If everybody of water in my county as listed as "do not eat the fish" due to industrial poisoning, will any man-made pond with drainage get poisoned in a flood?
--- 2568285
>>2567183
Honestly it depends I mean I'd rather use a 4-8 foot monofilament leader and my main line be Braided. Just depends on what I'm fishing for. On my 50 wide conventional reel I've got 200lb power pro Braided line with a 130lb monofilament topshot at 200 yards but I think next time I might think about going heavy monofilament on the whole reel.
--- 2568289
>>2568239
I would assume, and don't take my word for this, that by "poisoned" they mean acumulation of heavy metals in the fish, what kind of industry is it?
--- 2568307
Just found out a good fishing friend of mine passed away recently. Really fucking bummed out about that. I told him my exact locations where I caught bass, we shared with each other the bass behavior at a local city urban park we fished together, and discussed lure techniques. I was a gigantic jig fisherman while he was a crankbait and lipless trap guy, baits I never liked to throw because trebles scared me. 

He laughed at me when I transitioned to swimbaits, telling me if tiny trebles scare me, how the hell doesn't 2 big 1/0 trebles. Shared with him my cast to catch footage, only showing it to like ~4 people at most because I didn't want to share my spots. Going to miss that guy, RIP good friend. One of the few I could tell everything too and didn't have to worry about it going out.
--- 2568314
>>2568220
Maybe catching some baby stuff in the morning spoons are pretty versatile in baja. Cabo surf fishing is usually a 9'+ rod and 20lb line minimum. I micro fish a little in la paz, but most beaches in Cabo have big sketchy shore breaks.
--- 2568339
Are ugly stik rods actually that bad? I was gonna buy one for inshore, but as I'm trying to do more lure fishing I'm worried about the no sensitivity meme. Is it exaggerated, or are they legitimate broomsticks, even the elite/inshore select models I'm looking at? How would they compare to a similarly priced reputable rod, like the Marathon Guardian. I would forget about the ugly stiks if my rods weren't forced to be stored in a closet and transported by renting on top of the console along the length of my sedan.
--- 2568347
>>2568339
There is nothing wrong with them if you realize what they are designed for and the shortcomings. They ARE way less sensitive. They are more noodley at the tip. That's what makes them durable though. You can high stick them and they won't break. I've put one literally into my ceiling fan and nothing happened. I have a friend who treats his gear like shit, throwing it and all, and his hasn't broke. With that said... it doesn't mean that other rods "break easily." Most are plenty durable unless you treat your rod like shit, throwing it down, slamming it in car doors, trying to yeet snags in trees loose, and high sticking. If you are using mono, the sensitivity difference isn't noticed as drastically because the stretch takes away a lot of the feeling, but even on cheap line like Yo-Zuri Hybrid you will feel a difference. You will literally feel your bait touching bottom on most decent rods. Again... not really as important with baits that you constantly retrieve, but on ones that require a hookset it's a huge difference, almot needed. The Ugly Stik Elite is supposedly just a GX2 with higher percentage of graphite, but they don't feel a whole lot different when you use them back to back.
--- 2568348
>>2568347
I'm using 15lb x8 spiderwire with a mono leader. Should I avoid the mono? Or is just the leader not a big deal? Also what rods do you recommend?
--- 2568363
>>2568348
It's not as bad of a sensitivity loss as full mono, but obviously you still get some stretch and loss with mono leader. You can switch to Yo-Zuri Hybrid or a pure flouro and gain some sensitivity. As for rods... there are a lot honestly. It really depends on the budget, $100-150 being a sweet spot in my opinion. There are good $60-75 rods too, they just usually have guides that aren't as high-tier and less options on power/action. The $100+ rods also often come with good warranties. For example with a TFO rod, they will supposedly replace it if you break it for about half the price of a new one. If they honor that it's an extremely good deal honestly. I have a Professional model and I love it. I use it as a "do-it-all" rod and it really excells at that role. It's not a technique specific rod, but that's the allure. I'm actually planning to get another model in that line I like it so much. It feels really solid too if you're worried about something feeling fragile. Everything from the guides to the blank feel like you would really have to do something stupid to break it. It just has a really robust feeling without feeling like a stiff lifeless rod.

Link? Sounds cool. I wonder if you need to keep proof of purchase or something
--- 2568385
>>2568371
after looking again, it says if it fails due to defect... but they do offer a repair service. I could have sworn it used to be what I typed earlier, maybe it did. either way, these rods are built very well.

What makes you suggest those over the others?
--- 2568491
>>2568433
Echo is a solid rod with a moderate fast action and a decent reel spooled with good line for a reasonable price and a great warranty. It's a rod you may not even grow out of, and even if you do it'll still make a good backup rod.

The eagle claw is cheap and being fiberglass it will have a medium or maybe even slower action which is good for beginners because it gives more 'feel' and time for you to get set up between back cast and forward cast. An eagle claw was my first fly rod. I'm sure the others are decent but I don't have any first hand experience with them to say if they're good or bad.

Thanks for the advice. Both of those sound great and I'll have to think a while about what I'm gonna settle on buying. 

Another semi related question, how necessary is a net and waders for fly fishing?
--- 2568561
>>2568546
A net I could consider vital for fly fishing for trout unless everything you hook is gonna be super little, or you’re gonna eat them all. It’s not like it’s impossible to C&amp;R good trout without a net, but it can be a challenge and it’s a pointless challenge.
Waders are about your tolerance for spending time standing in cold rushing water vs your desire to stick it out. I’ve gone waderless in spring and glacial flows and I’d call it doable, but my friends called me Otzi after I fished the Stillwater River in May without waders (after mine tore and I didn’t wanna pay baitshop premium prices for ones that didn’t fit me) for a couple days in 2021, because no one agrees with me.
--- 2568576
>>2568546
>waders
only need them for cold water, in the warm you can just wet wade which is what i do in late spring to early fall
>net
thats a tough call. i usually dont bother with a net, i can usually just grab my fish or if im planning on eating the fish i just beach them. but then some people wont go fishing without a net. if you do get a net make sure its the rubber mesh, otherwise you could damage the slime coat and do more harm than good.
--- 2568655
>>2568561

Caught my first ever 5+ lbs bass. I don't have a good estimate on the weight since I've never caught anything more than 1ish lbs but from picking it up in the net, it felt really heavy, maybe 7-8 lbs but that could be just me overestimating as fisherman do. It was extremely girthy compared to the next one I caught shortly after which would've been my largest bass catch if it wasn't for the first one today. For scale, my net is 16 inches long. Caught on a 6 wt fly rod with a size 8 brown wooly bugger. I'm astonished I didn't break off or break my pole, but patience and letting the drag scream seemed to pay off. I was shaking after landing it so had to post it here, thanks for reading my blog.

I have fished a lot of small largemouth and bluegills this past 2 months with a light rod. Also, fished a couple of trout all with no live baits.
My first rod was a 50 bucks walmart spinning combo, I just want to use it for saltwater.
Now I want to buy a medium rod, but I'm not sure whether to start learning a baitcaster or stay with spinning rods.
Also, do rods past 7ft really matter for distance or is it pointless to go past that.

I am just getting back into fishing after being off for roughly 15 years. My only experience is catching Speckled Trout in NS with just a worm and hook.

you'd be surprised how often people do this when finesse fishing. it's always an unnecessarily large hook too with a big barb so you can't work it loose.
>>2569626
I intentionally bought a shallow two compartment basic pack because my emphasis was on minimalism and light weight. tacticool or big multipouch ones are good if you want to carry a lot of shit though. another hack is that you could buy a cheap "battle belt" and have modularity for different outings. pieces can add up though, even if it's noname chinese stuff. the Jansport Waisted pack fits one 3500 in the main compartment with enough room to cram some other stuff in there like soft plastic packs or relatively thin stuff, and the small compartment is perfect for your phone, a smaller tackle box, or random things about the size of your hand. the patch on the front allows you to thread excess strap through it and hang stuff with a carabiner, or just use paracord. you could also use paracord to hang stuff from the zippers too. I just like that even when it's fully loaded down it only sticks a few inches off the front, you don't feel like you have a shelf hanging off of you.

> Miravel
coreprotect
ci4 body
> Stradic
x-protect

> Vanford 
x-protect
ci4 body

those are the main differences, search the difference between coreprotect and x-protect, but both the stradic and vanford have much more than the miravel. think of the miravel as a "top of the line basicish reel." it's nice, but the other two are much higher tier. if you're fishing only freshwater, even the Sahara FJ is the cheapest model that is "premium feeling."

decent sized largemouth can easily swallow large hooks. if you're late on the hookset and somehow the fish is still on, it's probably gut hooked. I've seen guys do it on several occasions with 3/0 and up. one guy probably killed his PB that was over 7lbs. he tried to pry the damn thing out for like 5 minutes before cutting the line and throwing it back.

It's much less common with finesse metals, hard lures, and fleyes. The problem with most plastics is that they are impregnated with salt and scents so the even the most slackjaw of rubes can hook up.

I would go with the 4000. the 2500 is still pretty damn compact. It would work, but would get stressed on big fish more than a 4000 would. If you wanted to spend a bit more, you could grab a Penn Pursuit IV 2500. They're bigger than Shimanos and much beefier for the size, have sealed bearings, and used as saltwater beater reels regularly because they hold up and can be maintained. You can buy replacement parts for cheap to repair them if need be. They are not as smooth feeling as even cheap Shimanos though. As for line, it really depends more on the types of lures/bait you intend to use and fish you're likely to come across. 8lb trilene xl is strong, but it's pretty thin so you gotta be careful about toothy fish. If you use your drag properly, large bass for example are no problem on that line though.
--- 2569893
>>2569836
if it's for freshwater only I'd just save the money and go with the Miravel. It's only slightly heavier than the vanford and sometimes that honestly balanced the rod better anyways.

mexicans(often illegal) are always drowning in lakes because they don't stay in the swimming zones. I'd wager that besides them being drunk, a lot of them are probably getting hung up on fishing line snags. I get snagged on broken off wads of line pretty often so there is tons of it in there. The worst is heavy braid, that shit is like anchor rope. I've had to go neck deep in water with my knife to free my snagged lures on what seemed like 60lb braid. one more reason to hate bass fishermen.

Is top of the line gear from 10 years ago still good gear?
My Dad was a sort of legendary fisherman and owned tackle stores, we have carbon fibre daiwa rods and top of the line reels from about 10 years ago.
Are they still top of the game? Or has newer, cheaper gear surpassed what a 10 year old top of the line daiwa can do.

>>2569897
Define cheaper
Sub $100 reel and rod won't surpass premium/flagship reel/rod from 1 or even 2 decades ago at $200-300 + price point. Many technology don't change that much and the fundamental design/material/precision quality still serve as the core for the quality of the tackle. Some cheap chink shit can try to copy and incorporate "new tech" from shimano or daiwa or w/e but if their main gears and frame are built with cheap material and have terrible construction/quality control, the reel would still be shitty.
--- 2569909
>>2569901
Basically just wanted a gauge on how far fishing tackle technology has advanced in 10 or so years, and if whatever is inside a Stella reel from 10 years ago is now inside an entry level reel from Shimano.

I figure it's probably all about the same though really, I mean how overengineered can a spin reel get?

2010 Stella introduced x-ship, the Nasci which is Shimano's low-mid end basically has all the same features which is a $100 reel. The 2014 Stella introduced micromodule gearing, which you can find in the 2022 Vanford which is a $220 mid-range reel. 

Shimano's top of line baitcaster, the Antares, claim to fame was introducing the DC system in like ~2010 or some shit. That's trickled down into entry level low-mid end SLX baitcasting reels at ~$180. 

So basically, over the years, top of the line crap slowly trickles down, but it takes awhile. It still doesn't mean the reels are the same, Stella's, Calcutta Conquests, Antares, Steezs and Exists are going to feel buttery smooth for years from strict, strict quality control.

Green is probably best, but amber/beer bottle brown can work well too for those conditions. Clearer and deeper water, consider blue.

Green mirror polarized sunglasses. Just caught my first carp on the fly today by sightcasting for him with some Oakley Halbrooks on with that kind of lens. Obviously don't need to cash out for Oakley's but that kind of lens works great for dirty ponds like the ones I fish.

i think you'll be fine though for small stuff i like a slower action rod, i think it casts small lures better

I tried picking up fly fishing, but fly fishermen kept me from keeping up with it. You shoulda seen the look on the guy's face when I mentioned I ate calico bass.
--- 2570919
>>2570860
I never get this. Bass bros will rage at you if you take fish even though it's legal and most bass ponds were stocked for food fish to begin with. I get looks, sometimes dirty sometimes perplexed, when they see my stringer of one pounders bucket mouths. Society can't stand seeing a fly guy eating good.
--- 2570939
>>2570919
I mean I kind of get it with calicos, they're a relatively slow growing reef fish and they might not catch as many as they used to. I spearfish though and there are a lot more of them out there than people think, but they're pressured pretty hard here in socal and they're really smart and cautious for a fish. There's just a lot overlap between lmb guys and calico guys and they want trophy fish that they can catch.

i don't really understand it either
to me, bass don't taste that great but i don't take issue if someone keeps a few pounders either
--- 2570972
>>2570939
Yea calico is not so different than rock fishes and people are much more wasteful with rock fishes. They taste similiar too.
I don't keep most calico I catch though, even if they are legal size. I only keep them once in a while
--- 2570988
>>2570972
Lol ya, rockfish are way slower growing than calicos. Iirc the oldest recorded calico was like 35 and some of those big reds are almost 60 years old. Personally I never take more than 2 calicos at a time.
--- 2570991
>>2570988
I don't like to keep more fishes than how much I can prep right away for the day. Of course, people who pay $70-$200 to get on boats for will try to limit out on their fish take.

Any recommendations on tackle trays for storing glides and bigger soft bodied swimbaits?
--- 2571513
>>2571509
do you mean boxes? or a wearable tray for when you have waders on and standing in the water?
--- 2571514
>>2567945
>>2567950
Its a Grayling. Mostly a euro and Arctic thing but there's one place in the lower 48 where the end of the Ice Age left a few behind too. Closely related to whitefish so still in the wider trout family.
--- 2571517
>>2571509
>glides
wraps are much better than tackle boxes / trays, can't beat the swimbait underground 9" or 12" wrap
>softbaits
If you don't want a wrap, can't beat a Plano 3731 or a Meiho 3043 (the big, open one with no dividers) 

I use a wrap for bank fishing and a meiho versus 3043 for when I just throw them in a big box at home.

Boys, shill me some rods. Gonna go fishing some more with my mom and brother this summer, need a decent quality rod. Nothing crazy, just a good rod for a semi amateur fisherman that is good quality. I'm willing to spend a bit.

Caught this pretty fella today. Glad the rain finally stopped after a few months of there never being more than a 1 day break from it so the water is clearing up.
--- 2571527
>>2571525
go to your local shop and buy the second cheapest starting kit they have
--- 2571535
How much line does one really need for basic bitch shore fishing or river fishing? 150 yards enough?
--- 2571537
>>2571535
depends on how big the fish is, how deep the water is, and how high off the water you are. But reel spools are designed to have a reasonable amount of line on them. You would only be under capacity if throwing a larger line then intended on a reel.
--- 2571566

where would you move to live near a fishing paradise?
Tampa in Florida or New Orleans?
--- 2571641

If interested in salt water, last time I was in the Tampa area (Sarasota) the red tide was absolutely awful. Non-stop coughing at the beach because the air was more or less toxic, and the beaches were littered with dead fish everywhere. Not sure I would trust eating anything you catch there. Apparently red tide is just going to keep happening more and more frequently because of fertilizer use. The inshore freshwater fishing is fucking amazing though with tons of bodies of water. I have no experience with NO fishing.

I did some float fishing yesterday and I had a great time. I used to do this when I was a kid but then I moved to surf casting and spinning.
I love the simplicity of it, how minimal it is, feeling much more in control and the amount of focus required. Cheap as fuck too.
What do you think about this kind of fishing anons?
--- 2571735
>>2571726
I only do it 2-3 times when the lure fishing season is closed here
--- 2571740
>>2571726
i have the gear for it and ussually use it to introduce friends to fishing, one time i got lucky though, with a friend of mine and i swear they were taking down the bobbers as fast as we coul throw them in, this was like 7 years ago and my friends in now fully into the hobby
--- 2571747
>>2571735
Lol where do live that has a season where fishing with lures isn't allowed but live bait is?
--- 2571770
>>2571747
live bait is never allowed here, so it's bread or worms. Dead bait is also not allowed during closed season
--- 2571805
>>2571726
this is the main type of fishing I do, I have caught just about every kind of fish on a float. It has a stigma of being for kids for some stupid reason. Float and fly is one of the most effective rigs for small streams. I catch gamefish in saltwater with casting eggs and casting bubbles. Use a jig under a float in all kinds of conditions. Use popping corks with lure trailers. And then of course you can always just have bait under a float.

The only two situations it sucks is in high winds and high swell (if you are trying to fish the bottom of the water column). Other than that can fish it in just about any situation.

Two, actually. They were historically present in Michigan, but that population went extinct in the 1930s due mostly to habitat degradation, leaving Montana with the only remaining native population. There are also stocked populations in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Arizona, but attempts to introduce them to various waterbodies in New England apparently failed.

There are currently efforts underway to restore the species to Michigan.

>>2571921
I never heard about them being reintroduced into other states, mind throwing me a link? Reminds me of the program to reintroduce Bull Trout to the Clackamas River. I heard it went pretty well so hopefully they'll do it in a few more rivers.

seen a lot of videos of peacock bass smashing topwater baits, seems a go-to when fishing in the amazon.

will using a very small snap swivel interfere with using jigs/neds/keitechs?
--- 2572102

The action will be fine but any weeds or algae you fish through will get stuck to your presentation more easily and be a bigger pain in the butt to remove. Just git gud at tying knots.

I switched to fast snaps like picrel instead of snap swivels when I want to be able to change baits quick. They’re smaller and less noticeable and have less effect on the lures. They’re stronger too because they don’t rely on that little folded sheet of metal to hold everything together like old school snap swivels.

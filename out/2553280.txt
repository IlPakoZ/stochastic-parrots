Did you go /out/doors this season, or did you only stay /in/doors and consume youtuber vlogs like a fat larper?

>>2553280 (OP)
The snowpack here has reached record levels. I'll be snowshoeing in June. Must be lame to live in an overly urbanized shithole where there's only one week of winter left.
It sucks to suck.

Of course I went outside, and it hasn't snowed here a single time in the past 15 years.

You can cope all you want, but a deringer is a woman's gun. And spoilers: you will never be a woman.

Just spent a week skiing innawoods and slept a night in a snow ditch in below -30°C degrees. Had to cover my face with a scarf since all the moisture from my breath crystallized around the sleeping bag's breathing hole and then rained on my face every time i rolled around.

The next night was almost as cold and quite a lot more windy but a bit more sheltered.

The view was also nice. There was an avalanche incident on the very same area just a couple of hours ago, apparently nobody died but still a good reminder that it can be dangerous to mess around the backcountry this time a year.

i started split boarding this winter, probably my number 1 favourite activity already. it’s all i want to do ever since the first time i went out. going to rogers pass this week
--- 2563578
>>2561539
how do you even get started anon? I really want to but equipment costs are too much for me to jump right in blind

unfortunately shops around here are full of weekend warrior resort skiiers only

well i learned skiing as a kid and i go hiking and rock climbing in the alps so i just put 2 and 2 together. it's incredibly popular here in switzerland so finding a group was a breeze. i already had the hardshell gear from iceclimbing and bought the ski's and boots used. got the avalanch search thing for free from a coworker who didn't use it. 
maybe you can get something cheap when a local shop replaces its rental material? i got my ice tools for virtually free like this. they aren't the best but get the job done. or just rent the stuff the first couple of times and buy stuff over time when its on sale. pay attention when you buy a used dynafit binding, they loose tension with age. keep in mind that you'll ruin your first pair of skis rather quickly so it's not really worth it buying the newest and bestest as you first set

My only regret is not making it down to Utah for a ski trip. Then again, it seems like the crowds have gotten so bad that it might not be worth it anymore.

it's worth it if you stay near the top of the mountains and hike out to the good bowls
back country is always available if you're kitted out and are interested in that type of skiing

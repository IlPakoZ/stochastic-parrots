What’s your favorite meal to cook after a long hike? For me it’s a good roast or some kind of stew. It’s hearty and filling and puts me straight to sleep.
--- 2557420
>>2557408 (OP)
Anyone who carries all the necessary ingredients and equipment to make a stew or roast has never been on a long hike. The correct answer is peanut butter and tortillas
--- 2557425
>>2557420
Yeah okay, bud. If you pack it as the first night’s meal with frozen meat it will be perfectly thawed by the end of day 1. Sorry you only take foods that an autistic child can make.

>>2557408 (OP)
I like picrel as a meal or as a base with chorizo and rice/bread. 25 portions of hearty mushroom soup in a small tub
Lots of instant noodles (the good asian brands, i love em)
Tins of spicy macrel/sardines on fire toast
Fruit
Peanuts/chocolate raisins for energy
Rabbits or fish that I catch
Can carry butter without it spoiling, at reasonable temps. Definitely a nice addition
Teas/coffee/energy drinks
Small plastic bottle of whiskey/jaegermeister for a nightcap

I grab some fresh foods on the way out like ready-made sandwiches/pies for the first evening, to conserve my packed goods. With the listed supplies I can happily do 2-5 nights. There isn't much point in overthinking it unless you're heading out into serious wilderness.

>>2557845
I hike. Stop the gatekeeping.
--- 2557854
One of the best ways to hike (or camp, idgaf) is to bring awesome food mostly pre-prepped. I'll fill a 40 oz Nalgene with stew and bring a home baked loaf of french bread and some butter for the first night, that's the buena vida niggas. My old lady makes the bombest of burritos in every flavor, or quiche, or anything else that's heavy on fat that you crave after putting in some vert. Freeze the filling and bring the torts seperate.
Before you malign my ability to make distance carrying heavy shit, I'm tall and 240 lbs, I could carry most of you twinks in my fanny pack, if I had one.
If distance is your measure of grit, then cut your toothbrush in half and subsist on dried pig dicks and Tang, more power to you. You'll never see us, off-piste bushwhacking to the ultimate sites you'll never see while you're head down trying to get somewhere in a hurry. Check your strava again, you're almost on pace for thirteenth place.

I live near one of the clusterfuck capitals of the outdoors yet somehow we don't see anyone for days after leaving the TH. 
Pic related, didn't see a single person the whole day. No tracks, the first ones in that area this spring. 
We ate tuna sammiches, pepperoni, cheese and crackers and drank the snowmelt unfiltered, it was delicious.

It’s true everywhere. I took a trip to Zion years ago and the Disney Words comparisons are true until you get a few hours from the trailheads. The buses that run through the park were so packed we had to wait for a second one. It was peak season and it was to be expected, and we saw a few people on the trail but it was really shocking how few. The same for Great Smoky Mountain NP last year. Clingman’s Dome lives up to the “expectation/reality/ meme, and that where I parked. But for four days I saw like 4 groups of people, and all of them were on the AT section.

Stew is made in heaps of ways. You can literally make a stew in a jetboil or a kidney cup, stew doesn't have to be an all day 5 person meal cooked in a massive fuck off cast iron pot. You can even buy it in bags, just warm it up and you're ready to go.

i dont believe you. I usually take some kind of frozen meat like sausages and buns for the first day. the idea that someone is carrying around a roast, potatoes and carrots and broth which are extremely calorie light to weight ratio is laughable. Do you take your microwave and car battery too? Just say you day hike and cook it at home, its fine.

Day hikes with the cast iron are actually fun. You get get there in the morning, spend the entire day at your site screwing around and cooking a delicious stew, and then clean up and go home once the sun starts to set. A perfect day. I don't get why /out/casts try to act all tough like you're somehow "cheating" or a fraud unless you spend 15 days straight in the wilderness with nothing but a 15 pound pack, living off dehydrated meals and filtered swamp water.

Its possible that some people have physically trained themselves to be a pack mule by routinely carrying heavy bags. That person is not moving any faster going ultralite.

Me and my brother have a tradition going back to the 90s. We would spend a week or two camping in the White Mountains and would do one big hike or maybe two small hikes, and always return to the cozy campground after to recover. 4 days huffing ass across the Presidentials? Stop at MackDonalds on the way home. 1 day huffing ass up to Glen Boulder and Mt Isolattion? Stop at MackDonalds on the way home.

I'm sure plenty of people have enjoid McDicks as much as me and my bro over the last 25yrs, but nobody has enjoid it more.

Speaking as someone who was a security guard (lots of walking) up until last month? Luncheon meat mixed into white rice or macaroni and cheese, lentil mash with dried veggies, corned beef mixed into white rice, canned fish in fideo noodles, tortillas topped with canned ham and ez-cheese or with trail mix and peanut butter. These are things I could pile into a backpack-sized sterilite and carry into nowhere for a week.

Humanitarian Daily Rations are very cheap now. Fifty bucks for a case of ten. Two of those is a weeks' worth of food if you stretch it.

Thanks broheems. That batch was taco beef (from a good butcher), scratch hashbrowns, onions, cream cheese, pepper jack and maybe some mozza, can't remember. They look better and prob keep better with an egg wash, didn't do it that time. Good with some fresh salsa if you have it.
>>2573412
Que paso compadre! Love the sketch, poast moar but I understand not wanting to cast pearls here.
If you mean the bread, it's an easy mix of olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, green onions and whatever cheese you have. Stuff the mix in the bread, put two tablespoons of melted butter over the top, wrap it up and 350 oven for 23 minutes or so. Doesn't last at parties, always gets chowed down right away.
The meatballs are just spicy meatballs bbq'd with some sauce put on at the end.

Sausages and onion in chicken stock and butter, add butter beans to soak the juices, abit of soda bread too. Perfect scenario is it cooks while I square away myself and my camp and I eat it as the sun sets.

I cooked this 16th century Romanian pot roast with parsnips and garlic sauce in a Dutch oven a few times at home, not outdoors. It might be a good idea to make when you are casually camping or at a cabin with friends and family though. Not sure if I managed to make the garlic sauce exactly the right consistency though. I doubled the recipe (parsnips were tripled and you could even still do a little more) and managed to fit it all still in the Dutch oven and it fed five people.

The sauce was kinda mediocre too in my opinion, but again I’m not sure if I made it right. Regardless, I definitely think you should include garlic somehow to add flavour and ward off evil.

I know most of you are American white and aren't as familiar with this dish, but we got a bomb ass dish in the Mediterranean known as shakshuka. Very old world and rustic. Just need some olive oil, eggs, peppers ( I use 1 jalapeno, 1 anaheim, 1 red bell, and 2 red fresnos) and 1 onion, cooked in a a can of diced tomatos, eaten with bread. Spices I use are kosher salt, black pepper, coriander powder, touch of cumin and cayenne pepper (just premeasure 1.5 tablespoons of each except cumin and throw in a bag). Can use 1 clove garlic to bring out the extra flavor. Shakshuka is one of my favorite camping meals, both backpacking and car camping. Precut everything at home. Can garnish with cilantro, green onions, avocado or whatever you feel fit like feta cheese. Lots of variations too including beans as well

honestly man, I well marbled ribeye, grilled over wood fire, with a tasty beer and some peppers grilled swiftly after the steak. That shit hits the damn spot.

Second best if I've got a car camp, I used to make a badass apple cobbler in the dutch oven when I'd have friends go camping with me (they don't anymore) and that was always a hit. 

If it's a REALLY long hike though, the NextMileMeals Spaghetti and Zucchini dish can't be fuckin beat when it comes to freeze dried shit, that's incredible and I'll shill it all damn day

How do you store your toothbrush when you go out? Honest question. 

I really think the ultralight toothbrush handle trope started because of a dichotomy between people who were practical and boomer NPC’s who either refused to change or simply lacked the ability to do so. I don’t think it started as a way to save weight, though it’s probably that now.

30 years ago you couldn’t find pic rel. They’re ubiquitous now, but the internet didn’t exist and no one had them locally. At the time, people were starting to use lighter gear. Pack frames were disappearing, Ray Jardine had released his book, and tracking pole tents were becoming popular. 

When asked in an interview at Trail Days what he thought was the biggest change in backpacking gear over the decades, Earl Shaffer didn’t hesitate before saying “Ziploc bags.” And that’s how everyone in the 90’s was packing their toiletries. The thing is, a full size toothbrush doesn’t pack well into a quart Ziploc. So, we cut the handles. At the same time, everyone was bringing less stuff and using lighter gear.

discussing your reports is a bannable offense newfag. you're incredibly pretentious.

There's specifically a report option for someone announcing a report. There is not, however, an option for someone claiming to know what shakshuka is.

Forgetting for one night is okay but any longer than 2 days without brushing is disgusting. Doesent matter if you're /out/ or not. Even if you don't eat much plaque is still an issue.

I get it just by eating too many carbs and not enough protein. I stick to lighter meals, high protein, or lower carb eating these days.

After some time out you will stink anyway, so teeth is not an issue, just take a mint pill on your way back.

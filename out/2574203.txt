How do I learn to think of gardening more positively? My mother had a garden and it was always my least favourite chore growing up, I would rather spend four hours doing dishes or literally anything else than spending four hours doing yardwork.

My girlfriend's parents brought us planters, dirt and seeds so we can have a potted garden on our balcony. I know they meant well and that she would like to have a yard with a garden of our own one day, but I have a hard time being grateful. We were just handed another household chore to do. Another responsibility to keep track of. I would not feel any different if they had brought in a bag full of dirty dishes or wet laundry "just in case you run out of things to do :)"

I know that my girlfriend wants us to have a food garden and to be self-sufficient on homegrown food, but since I work from home and she doesn't, I feel like the responsibility for tending for these plants that literally everyone except for myself wanted to have on our balcony is going to fall onto me. How do I look at them more positively than as another completely unnecessary and avoidable chore to do?

grow something that excites you, maybe weed

I don't even like smoking weed.

And we were handed a garlic plant too, specifically for me. I can get garlic from the store much easier than that, so it doesn't spark joy either, despite of that being the specific intention here. My girlfriend doesn't eat garlic, they got that plant specifically for me. I would rather buy it from the store.

I can't tell if all of these posts are just one low effort troll from someone who hates this board, or if there's just a pattern of tourists coming from other boards to ask their one question. It's the same formula every time dozens of times a month

Growing flowers is for women. Growing vegetables isn't going to save you any money so if you're not interested just don't do it.

Don't do it if you don't like it. Grow a fucking spine.

Flowers are necessary for permaculture. The majority of top horticulturists and Botanists are men...not to mention farmers. 
The reality is most woman are actually awful at nurturing--that was always a meme.

grow jeruselem artichoke 
you'll never have to take care of it
you'll always have it around
it'll just be there, waiting
if you're such a faggot about doing even the most basic shit with your hands, just chose something that'll never require otherwise

>How do I learn to like plants, because I don't like plants
You don't. Stop being a limp wristed faggot and tell your girlfriend the truth: you hate plants and are too much of a delicate Hikikomori to be exposed to direct sunlight. God forbid you get those manicured nails dirty.

well, what have you tried growing on your own as an adult? my reccomendation would be to start with something super easy and small that you can enjoy right away. radishes, cilantro, and pot-marigold would be my go-to to get you started into the basics of enjoying growing plants. There's no pulling weeds, no worrying about animals eating your fruit, and you'll see great results with all of them in like a month's time compared to a few months like most veggies. 

As for the fun aspect, that comes from all of the "playing" you do with your plants as well as the satisfaction of learning new skills and knowledge. Knowing how to raise food from nothing is one of the most important skills a human can have and there's always something new to learn or try. It's a hobby, not a chore.

If you want SUPER luxury, I suggest the Exped Deluxe inflatable pillows. Those are retardedly comfy. FYI though, they're a tad wide, so watch out if you want to put them inside a mummy bag. I have one in both green and red.

>inflatable pillows
holy fuck no i couldn't sleep the whole night because of that. it feels like sleeping on a balloon

but i also noticed that a lot of people don't use pillows at all like Shiey, do they just fold some clothes?

I sleep like shit without a pillow, inflatable ones suck ass cause they're loud, hard and always get statically charged. I gladly waste some space for the Carinthia pillow, not perfect but as close as it gets. Also I got it in multicam black which is kino.

What's it made of, the fill, and weight? I never had an issue with an inflatable pillow like you described. Maybe don't fill yours with a whole lungful of air?

>mfw dont use a pillow even at home
I dont understand the appeal. All they ever do is make my neck sore and make it hard to sleep. I also was forced to sleep on a wood floor with only a blanket for my entire childhood so that might have fucked me a little, but i cant be the only one.

the backpacking community speaks really highly of the nemo filo elite, but i've never used it so I can't speak to it myself. I rock with the sack full of clothing myself.

Kid size pillow. They're like 1/3 of an adult pillow.

I can't sleep without one because as a back sleeper my mouth falls open. Then I breathe with my mouth, causing me to wake up from the noise/vibrations. How do you avoid basically snoring?

I just roll up my pants and sleep on those. Put my socks/shirt on top of it if I really want to spoil myself.

I bought an inflatable pillow and took it kayak camping on the river but preferred stuffing a dry bag with clothing as it was more comfy.

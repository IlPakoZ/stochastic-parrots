You wouldn't be shot you would be held for ransom, this of course is only the case if you only encounter the laborers.

It's quite literally still filled with cannibals. So yes, it is precisely built for BEC.

I had a kiwi friend that used to work there for a bit. The last case of cannibalism that he knew of was in like 2010. That should tell you a lot about that place.

Temperature aside, it is incredibly inhospitable for humans.

There's a Kiwi pilot kidnapped there at the moment, he's being held ransom. The separatist's want the NZ government to stop supporting the Indonesian's genocide of the people and destruction of the ecosystem. Which is based as it gets. 

> Indonesian's sent a rescue team who got slaughtered.

> The rebels want the pilot to teach them how to fly
> He's very comfy.

Jungles are the most vile, awful places on earth and the only reason humanity didn't come together as one to wipe them out years ago is we need them as a carbon sink.

They already annexed the whole west half in he 60s and have one of the longest ongoing wars in the world with an armslist so insane that it makes /k/ coom if they are smart enough to pay attention. For an interesting time check out the total ban on journalism and the soft power war indonesia is waging in info via wikipedia. The edit war on the pages for casualty numbers are insane. Heated stuff. Makes 4chan look socially adpated. But yeah they fucked with East Timor, killed a stack of australian journalists in Balibo back in the 90s, and have managed to keep an absolutely collosal arms industry as well as stealing the worlds largest gold mine. All while having shiara law in Aceh and being the sort of South east asian equivilent to USA in terms of raw human power. Enough that China is scared ot fuck with them. People mix them up with the phillipines a lot. But they are litteral far cry villains as a nation. They've had a lot of open war with the colonials for a lot of the post ww2 era. Some crazy shit in the 50s too. Some of the hardest hiking terrain on earth too.

Australia, Britain, etc
They couldn't even hold on to half of Timor without needing to genocide the locals and even then lost. It's an africa-tier disfunctional shithole.

Been steadily ripping the cords out of my life for a few years. Started with getting rid of my smart phone for a flip phone. Selling my computer today. Just wanted to scream into the abyss one last time before I left. I'm a-homesteading now! Oh accursed digital generation, to be born to thee is to be gestated in misery. Godspeed and Uncle Ted bless

I live out in the country and have a decent PC with internet. I think Uncle Ted was right on a few things but he didn't have to hurt those innocent people, was kinda nuts. I'm actually considering a fifty dollar chromebook to take innawoods with a 4G dongle, cause I have never used a computer with internet while out innawoods, and I could shitpost here while doing so. Just to see what it's like, because I am out in the forest hunting and fishing and trapping anyways.

Good luck, anon, if this isn't a LARP.

I think Ted has made some great points and I agree with some of what he has to say but I think that moderation of technology use is just fine if you can balance it. Tech is like a drug but the "high" that one chases is different. Sometimes it's social and we all know how extreme behaviors can manifest from people obsessed with likes on FB and other platforms. Sometimes it's escapism as in video game addiction. 
But is IS possible to use technology as an aide and not as a cornerstone of your world.

actually he was right
humans on responded to violence
that's how the state controls us anyways
authority is the power to kill, government is to do so with impunity.

Godspeed, faggot.
I wish I had it in me. But even then, can't do this shit in Europe.
I hope you succeed in whatever it is you're aiming for.
Forever fuck the nay-sayers.

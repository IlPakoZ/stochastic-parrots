It's not like many people are frothing at the mouths trying to get into this business. retaining employees is hard enough. why gaslight your hard working employees just to lose them to your competition? people are weird.

it's not, this is a lie companies tell to get more applications so they can keep paying peanuts.

Something no MBA wants to hear is that people don't quit jobs, they quit bosses. OP is a classic example.

Maybe they just didn't like you.

I did work in landscaping/gardening. It may be fun while you are young but the work is simply overtraining from a healthy point of view. You will age quicker, and your joints will be gone by your late 20s. If you can't get into a managing position, or relax on the side somehow I wouldn't do it.

How do you even find work? I'm 31 years old and have never had a job, every application just gets turned down. Shouldn't they get paid by the government to babysit a retard like me? I don't do drugs or anything either.

Not trying to be a jerk, but how did you get to 31 without having to work a job? I wouldn’t expect neets to be on the touching grass board

Based, I’m hoping to find another outdoor job once summer comes around. I’m thinking landscaping or maintenance at a campground

Touching grass is free. I went to college for 3 years, then my appendix ruptured and I had to be hospitalized for a few months which took a long time to recover from. Then a few months after I recovered I was in a car accident that shattered my hip and I more time in the hospital and even more time recovering from, with walking/hiking being part of my physical rehabilitation I ended up liking it a lot. Then COVID happened and no one was hiring.

I have literally been living with my parents or in the hospital for all of my life, and when I get to job interviews they ask "why haven't you worked for 10 years?" explaining my unlucky 20s isn't enough for them. I could go back to college, but my parents just finished paying off my student loans and medical bills this year so I'd feel bad to get them more in debt.

My last job was for a security installation contractor. I was already quiting because the job sucked, but we regularly had Monday morning meetings where my boss would bitch about us to our faces. I already had my two weeks notice in and quit before my last week because my boss implied that I didn't help my co-worker by staying overtime even though I did, in fact, do just that. I caused a scene and my other boss apologized to me because everyone else in my company was pissed too by that meeting. I told him that he was going to keep bleeding employees, and he told me he'll agree to disagree. I quit that day and he had lunch with two of my other co-workers that told him the same thing. He broke down crying. They lose touch by design. Management just gets pissed that you don't work fast enough while they deal with clients. I'm sure you employer never saw you work.

I'll be honest I read your post and my first reaction was you're a whiny hypochondriac. I could well be wrong and all those unlucky things did really happen to you, but my guess is everyone else is thinking the same thing.

I assume that's what the interviewers think as well, but how the fuck do I get around it? Should I just lie? Make up a bunch of fake jobs I did throughout my 20s? I could show them my medical records or a doctor's note, but I doubt they give a fuck.

Lie, have people do fake references for you. You can do entry level jobs at a grocery store or something and just say you worked at a grocery store for like 3 years, had your accident, then COVID happened. Places will like you were at a place for more than 2 years as well. A lot of people jump around after a year or two at jobs and people hiring notice that.

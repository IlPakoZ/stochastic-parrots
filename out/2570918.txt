Literally the only knife that you can use openly without scaring the normies. Everything else is concidered as a threat. Military style "tactical knives" are the biggest red flag and people will avoid you at all cost.

>>2570918 (OP)
so i should carry around a military style assault knife then?
--- 2570924
not true
a smaller scandi grind without tacticool styling is perfectly acceptable
in my experience people think its a fishermans knife and they’re right, i am fishing

Knives are peak larp. Aside from the kitchen, there is really no need for even a swiss army knife. A small pair of scissors is much more useful for backpacking.

I get away with the tiny Candiru without scaring the normies. The whole thing goes in the palm of my man hands.

What are you doing with your knife that you're scaring normies?

If you work in customer service or some shit, like you need to open a box for a customer, a good chunk of older women take a step back if you flip open a 3”+ tacticool folder.

simple pocket sand will break it

I just got that one. When you try to oil the hinges to make it smooth and a little pocket sand works its way in there and it feels like death every time you open the knife.

No it won't.

Genuine question, how would you get the paracord off of the top middle knife? Would you cut it somewhere or unwind it from the knot at the top? Does it make it more comfortable to hold? How many feet is it?
--- 2571791
>>2571786
Nta but the paracord isn't meant to come off. If you really to, you can cut it and unravel it.

Untie it, cut it, you can see where the ends are burnt and I’m sure you could pop it through with a stick or something and unravel it if you wanted.
--- 2572750

Hot soapy water flush, compressed air blast, rinse, dry, and oil.

The depth of retardation expressed by obedient, passive serfs is inexplicable. Imagine giving up self defensive items because some Karen is scared of them....bitch, that's the point.

There is no such thing as a neck knife. Whatever marketing retard that came up with that needs to be sterilized. I have a small fixed blade that I pocket Carey because having a knife dangling around your neck is retard and unnecessary...and unsafe in most industries.

Just because 1983 was a long time ago doesn't mean the knives are bad now

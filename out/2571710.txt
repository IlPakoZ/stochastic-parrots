Have you read "Edible Forest Gardens"? I'm halfway through volume 2 now, and I'm really enjoying it. Planning is pretty intense, and the book is kind of a slog, but I'm really excited to have trees and bushes and actual nature in my backyard instead of just stupid grass.

i'm gonna be planting a bunch of luffa along a fence once any chance of freeze in my area is totally null (i'm in north west tennessee)
does anyone have any experience growing them first hand, and if so, got any tips for growing them?
i've never grown luffa before, and my plan is just that once they're started, i'll probably just let the grow like wild fire, and maybe trim a few young fruits whenever i want a meal

I guess this is probably the best place to ask.

I got into gardening a few years ago and love it now I want to turn my hobby into something that can make me some money on the side. Has anyone here had success running a market garden? I live in a county where there's a nice mix of urban and rural so there are always plenty of farmers markets going on throughout the year and I want a slice of the action.

I want to know what kind of crops do the best, do specialty/novelty crops sell better than staples, and are there any legal hoops I need to jump through to start this?

Both hard and softneck garlic, shallots, dried gourds, micro greens, cut flowers, and berries are good money makers. Pumpkins, decorative corn, peppers, sweet corn and tomatoes are okay money makers. In last place are onions, potatoes, beans, carrots, and peas. Value added products can be good money makers. Like hardneck garlic powder, braided garlic and onions, chile ristas, jams, jellies, pickles, finished birdhouse gourds, and sauerkraut. I'm sure I'm missing a bunch.

It's a somewhat notorious thing that 99/100 sellers are lying about the wattage of the LEDs. A plant will generally want at the very least a 100w equivalent bulb set over it.

I'm a broccoli plant in a small pot, to get myself some extra seeds and because I like the looks of the plant anyway
It's almost 2 months old now, looks like it can't support many leaves at once since the older ones are being sacrificed

So several months back I "planted" a jalapeno seed, and some green onions I got from the grocery store, into my Aerogarden. The green onions grew normally for months, and the jalapeno did its thing also. However, for the past couple weeks, ever since the jalapeno plant stopped producing fruit and instead focused on ripening its peppers, the green onions have been growing like apeshit. Like no shit, I don't have a tape measure handy, but each shoot seems to be about 2.5 feet long, as long as my arm from my shoulder to my wrist. What's up with that? I'm thinking, the jalapeno plant is now no longer drawing so many resources from the shared aeroponic "pool", and so now the green onions get to use most of it, and as a result, have gone apeshit. You can see two of the shoots in this pic, there's a third that flopped over due to its own weight. There's another one growing fast as well, probably at one foot now.

Any recommendations on what to plant in my garden? I only want to grow edible plants which are either perennial, expensive in the produce department, or hard to get in good quality at the store. Currently in my garden I've got beets, basil, blueberry bushes, and maca. I'm in zone 7a.
--- 2572279
>>2571871
What you should grow depends on your market but things that you can't get at the grocery store, which don't require much processing and which aren't likely to be found in backyard gardens are always a solid bet, bonus points if they're not especially time-sensitive. It's really a matter of knowing your local market but stuff like the less common berries (chokecherry, elderberry, gooseberries and currants, etc.) generally do pretty well and you can't go wrong with heirlooms of all stripes but alliums, chiles, gourds, kitchen herbs and beets are easy to manage compared to something like tomatoes. Fuck growing tomatoes; the cunts start going bad as soon as you get them off the vine and they bruise when you look at them. As well you can also grow, for lack of a better term, "ethnic produce" but that's going to be a local thing. If you live in the north woods then lingonberries and bilberries might be a hot ticket item, if you live in an area with a lot of Japanese immigrants and a permitting climate then things like mitsuba, shiso, naganegi etc. might be a good idea, in the southwest you might have a market for fresh epazote, and so on.

>>2572234
The various Ribes as well as elderberries are nice. Personally I'm a bit fan of chokecherries as well because they taste like home to me.

Today I pulled the bins full of container mix off the garden. Then scraped off last year's straw mulch, along with the leaves I just dump in the penned off garden, putting both in the compost.

There's a set of plants used especially for this purpose. They seem to be called 'groundcover' in general.
Those that come to my mind right now: cotoneaster horizontalis, creeping junipers, stonecrop, periwinkle.
They grow up to 0.5m tall and spread horizontally.

>giant shrubs/trees/etc

A tree will take only as much of the lawn's area as the space occupied by its stem.
Giant shrubs will most likely need to be pruned, so instead of mowing, you'll be pruning.

Strawberries are perennial and though not exactly expensive, the ones you grow at home taste so much better than what you get at the produce section.

Cheap, practically inert dirt. Mostly clay. I think its the dirt collected from nearby construction sites as they level the land, bagged and sold at the big box home improvement store.

I need some help with lawn care. 

I've got a very tricky area a client failed several times to establish lawn in. 

A. It's got ten meter high walls, so gets little sun in winter and a ton in summer
B. Its exposed to frost, temperate zone, ambient -6 to 40c 
C. It will get heavy foot traffic
D. The soil doesn't drain well because of the walls foundation. 
E. It's heavily mossed, 60% moss coverage before I scarified it. 
Your first thought it probably "that's a terrible place for a lawn" and you'd be right.... but the client wants it done as a flex.

My plan is to lay a fine fescue in the hope it will quickly cover bare area and survive foot traffic, then add some lawn sand to keep moss down and improve drainage, then oversow a second kind come spring

> any worthwhile crop needs supplementing

You can just grow varieties/cultivars or species that don't need supplementing. It's your choice.

Either in my garden, or in my parents' garden, the plums, apples, a pear, a mulberry, a chestnut and an apricot trees grow and fruit without supplementing.
Same for hazelnuts, currants, a gooseberry, raspberries, a pair of actinidia arguta and wild strawberries (that randomly popped in my lawn and grow and fruit despite being regularly mowed).
Even some kitchen utility plants such as chives, oregano, thyme, sage, winter savory, not to mention mint and balm, grow by themselves (and most of these spread naturally invading my lawn).

None of these are of a variety that has been specifically created for intensive gardening. They probably would grow more / larger fruits if they were supplemented, but hey, with pruning, weeding (and occasional spraying with fungicides and/or pesticides) I harvest more than I can eat.

--- 2572876
>>2572776
Not him, but I'm fully organic and still rely on both. With good management you don't need much, but good management IS using them when needed. 

Copper based spray for fruit trees is essential, you can't control weeds in paths without a contact spray, some lawns need fungicide and so do fruit trees.

This "organic" thing is total bullshit, 
Synthetic chemicals are often better because they are pure, "organic" products can be as harmful as anything else.

Sustainable land management is very real, and it doesn't exclude pesticide use. Many pests, diseases etc aren't even native to begin with.

ALL of the potatoes.
No but really, it depends on how my harvest goes.
I'm not going to baby my potatoes and they will mostly have to fight for themselves, so I imagine the yield per plant will be greatly reduced. Another thing is the initial growing conditions won't be super luxurious either.
So they will be challenged to put it lightly.

Anyway I will go and dig(with no machinery) as much as I can, plant as much as I can, and then harvest and eat as much as I can.

Once you notice that your plum suddenly withers (what?!), so you take a close look why all leafs are hanging down limply, and you notice that they simply got sucked out by a legion of aphids installed and guarded by a colony of ants, then there is no sane solution other than spraying the tree with a systemic pesticide.

Once you notice that your pine lost half of its needles overnight and the reminder of your tree moves, so you take a close look and you notice pine sawfly larvae, then there is no sane solution other than spraying the tree with a pesticide (unless you've got a couple of hours to remove them by hand).

>>2572903
The whole organic vs standard farming stuff is not about no chemicals at all, but rather no chemicals when there exists an alternative solution other than "burn everything down".

The problem with standard farming is that you spray regardless whether it's necessary, and you use the cheapest and strongest shit that is still allowed.
It's like "oh, it's mid April, so I must spray all my apple trees with that pesticide" without even checking whether the target insects are present anywhere nearby.

A good example of what the standard farming does and the organic is required not to do is dessication.
This is essentially killing plants such as legumes, some grains, sunflowers, corn etc. with herbicides shortly before harvest.
It's a purely economic thing – when a plant dies, it speeds up seed development, so they ripen more simultaneously, and the plant dries, so this makes harvesting less complicated and thus cheaper.
Does any farmer care that you consume the whatever substance that killed the plant? The officially allowed ones are said to be harmless for human, but glyphosate is cheaper and legal to buy, so guess what the farmers use...

Again this covers why, I find "organic" to be bullshit most of the time, because it still gets sprayed with shit when I expect a clean product.

>aphids, less nitrogen, lady bugs
Lol, you just proved you never grown anything for real. Lacewings, ladybugs, aphid midges larvae and most hover flies larvae and even some spiders are actively attacked by ants once they try to eat the aphids, so when the aphids are bred by ants, all those natural aphid predators are either eaten or thrown off the plant by ants.

>sawfly larva, some kind of bird that eats them, maybe woodpeckers?
Sawfly larvae are capable of defoliating a large part of your tree before the birds notice their presence. And you probably don't have enough birds around to eat all the larvae before the larvae eat your tree.
Pest of this kind can even literally eat a whole forest. The pine beauty has eaten approximately 220 000 ha (850 square miles) of pine forest in my country in 1922-1923. The only thing that killed the pine beauties back then was some epidemic disease that could spread for the pine beauties were literally everywhere.

>don't know shit about growing peaches
So shut up.
Except from fungicides there is only one way to prevent the peach leaf curl: let no water – even morning dew – touch the peach tree since November until mid May. So you either afford a greenhouse with controlled humidity, or you spray the peach trees with fungicides, or you have leaf curl.
Some peach varieties don't die when they have leaf curl every season, but those sold for their tasty fruits survive less than five years if you don't fight the leaf curl.

There is two types of sunflowers. Confection and oilers. Confection are used for eating in or without the shell. And they're normally have black and gray stripes. And they have thicker shells than oilers. Oilers are normally black. And have smaller thinner shells compared to confectionary sunflowers. You can still eat oiler seeds. Its just harder to crack the shell since they're smaller and the kernels are smaller. 
Giant sunflowers don't always produce giant kernels. Most of the time you'll get a giant shell with small to average sized kernals. If you're looking for big kernels. Look for Royal Hybrid varieties. Btw choco sun is a dwarf ornamental sunflower. It only gets about a foot tall.

Apple trees need a different variety to cross pollinate. Either another apple or crab apple will do. But you need them to bloom at the same time. There are some self fertile pears and plums out there. Also depending where you live you may need a really hardy fruit tree to survive harsh winters. I'd say pear, plum, then apple in that order. Stick with dwarf or semi dwarf unless you want a 20-30' tall fruit tree. If you're dead set on apple trees. Look into Liberty or Freedom varieties. Great apples and they are very resistant to scab, rust, fire blight, and powdery mildew. Don't fall for the honeycrisp is great for starters meme. It doesn't tolerate high heat and it gets sunburn, also it has low vigor and a thin skin. Its susceptible to fire blight, fly speck, sooty blotch, bitter pit, and mildew. You also have to thin the fruits otherwise you'll have tiny fruits. And that goes for all fruit trees.

--- 2573296
>>2573246
>>2573281
I'd add to that to check what are the common diseases for pear, apple and plum in your area.
There where I live the pears are attacked by the pear rust that severely damages most pear varieties and can't be avoided if you have an infected juniper within 1km, so I'd say an apple/plum is easier here. Wikipedia calls that disease 'European pear rust', so it might not even threaten you.

That's quite easy to manage. If you regularly dispose of fallen leafs and remove all dead fruits &amp; any leftover leafs from the trees late autumn, the scab damage will stay within acceptable limits.
The leafs can even be dug underground, and after a couple of seasons they pose no threat. Also, if the leafs decompose over winter, they no longer pose a threat, so one of the cheap mass-scale strategies is to spray trees with urea once the leafs start falling down, this provides an extra boost for the bacteria decomposing leafs.

Hello /out/doorsmen. I have an issue.
So I recently got really into the idea of composting since I figured that it would be a way better method of acquiring fertilizer. So I decided to buy a square foot of mulch to use as an ingredient, red mulch to be specific. Now at the time I did not do enough research to realize that dyed mulches can actually fuck up a good compost pile. Is there a way to save this mulch so I can use it as a compost? Please help
--- 2573631
>>2573628
why would you buy mulch to make compost?
--- 2573633
>>2573631
Should probably mention that I very much rushed and overthought this whole process. Point and laugh I know
--- 2573637
>>2573633
>Most colored mulches are dyed with harmless dyes, like iron oxide-based dyes for red or carbon-based dyes for black and dark brown. Some cheap dyes, however, can be dyed with harmful or toxic chemicals.
you're probably fine
--- 2573643
>>2573637
>"probably"
Regardless. I read that mushrooms can aid in breaking down the dyed material in mulch to make it more digestible for compost worms. So maybe I can gather some mushrooms and spread them into the compost?
Or I'm looking too deep into it and I should just use the red-dyed compost for my non-edible plants.

It would been easier and cheaper to just find twigs and branches to add to your compost pile. It's going to take a long time for the wood to break down. You could speed it up by hot composting.

I swear.... It feels like im taking crazy pills. Why would somebody waste the effort and energy to gather up things that would decompost, pile them up, and then waste gasoline to burn them, and smoke up the entire place. And waste good compost to be.

You can only give advice, and that's where things usually end. When you're more in line with someone, it becomes fun to learn new things from eachother and in turn you respect eachother for it.

--- 2573837
>>2573835
>You can only give advice, and that's where things usually end.
Well I politedly brought up the issue and mentioned that it's just slow release fertilizer that will rot and feed the land anyway and if you want to speed it up, then moisture and nitrogen will speed it up. There is no real gain to tidying up the land by robbing it of the nutrients like leaves, straw, branches and so on.
And again, it's extra work, but whats the gain? They would probably gain more from just sitting back relaxing in a chair and taking in the peaceful scenery. Instead they "rape" themselves and the land and air.
The senselessness of it all bothers me inside.
--- 2573843
>>2573837
>what's the gain?
Pile of shit that I don't want to be there isn't there. Brush piles provide shelter for nuisance animals like gophers. Brush piles look bad.

Not really. Also, in the same way you don't care about the appearance of a shitty Brush pile, your cousins don't care about composting like you do. 

Offer to Take the brush to your own property to compost. Win-win.

Can anyone help me identify this bug? I'm afraid it feeds on my pear tree.

Today I checked why some of my pear saplings look slightly withered, and found this insect trying to hide behind a twig. I didn't see any other signs of other pest or reason that could do the damage. I'm in central Europe.

The bug run around the twig to stay away from me, and it looks somewhat similar to hopper nymphs. Does not jump, does not fly.

Sorry for the quality, this bug does not want to sit still and it's hard to make a good photo of a 4mm bug. The background is millimetre paper for reference.
(I put that insect in my fridge, so I can take fresh photos if these were insufficient. Cooled down insects make better models.)

Read some of the guides in the pastebin in OP >>2571710 (OP)
If it were my garden, I would spread a moisture control on top (like shredded hay or something like that) and only loosen up the soil in the immediate area where I plant my seedlings. Most vegetables don't have deep/wide roots, so no need to till the whole garden unless you are doing a high density planting.
--- 2574043
>>2574038
tamarack -> wikipedia -> American larch.
I can't tell if the American version of larch does the same, but the European one shed the needles earlier than it's supposed to if it's too dry. So if you had, say, a month of no rain, then it would explain that your larch lost its needles in summer rather than in autumn.

how young are your saplings?
these things usually feed on grass, they poke the stems and suck through
when you see foam on grass at the junctions of leaves and stems it's their drool in which they lay their eggs
seems unlikely to me they would feed on something which contains lignin such as your saplings, they usually stick to tender stuff
--- 2574202

>how young are your saplings?
I grafted them a year ago, now they're ~60cm tall and grow new twigs.

>when you see foam on grass at the junctions of leaves and stems it's their drool in which they lay their eggs
Not all hoppers do that, and not only hoppers do that (I've heard that grasshoppers do that as well).
Those hoppers that do are apparently called 'spittlebugs' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrophoridae), and spittlebugs present in my country have green nymphs.

>seems unlikely to me they would feed on something which contains lignin such as your saplings, they usually stick to tender stuff
I wouldn't say so, rose leafhoppers feed on roses, rhytidodus species feed on aspen etc. 

I'm quite concerned about this because most of these f**king hoppers transmit diseases from tree to tree, including viral diseases that don't spread naturally.

My guess is that this is a maple seeding. Probably a sycamore (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_pseudoplatanus).

Notice the stalk is reddish, the cotyledon is oblong, and the true leaves have opposite arrangement and start to resemble maple leaves.

If you let the true leaf form fully, you can confirm whether my guess is right.

The winged fruits of maples make these trees more invasive than most weeds...

While other anon is being an oversimplifying dingus it's really not that complicated.

Wa la, you have successfully gardened. You didn't need a greenhouse or a rototiller or grow lamps or to worry about your soil PH or companion plantings or ANYTHING. Will it make the cover of Sunset? No. Will you enjoy it? Probably. Will it be a learning experience? You bet. Unless you live somewhere with like an 80-day growing season or you fuck up colossally (like going away for a week in august without having someone water your plants) you're pretty much guaranteed to get some kind of return on your investment and from there you can decide if you want to do it again.

I know its 
>DUDE WEED

but this chart is pretty accurate, most seedlings can tolerate light up to about 300PPFD, most vegetative plants max out at 800PPFD without additional CO2. Leafy greens usually need about 300, 200 is rather low. Only invest above 600 if you NEED to fruit/flower something that you cant just do in a pot outside, lighting gets expensive. 

>IGNORE PAR
>IGNORE LUMENS
>PPF IS YOUR GOD

PPF = umol/s
PPFD = umol/m^2/s

umol/s can be calculated of the lights umol/J rating x the Wattage. So a 24W Fluorescent bulb @ 1.4umol/J will produce 33.6 PPF. 

This should be provided by any LED grow light manufacturer, if they don't tell you what the umol/J or umol/W rating is in the spec sheet don't even consider buying it. Other types of lights are too inconsistent to say exactly. 

Ali express shit is ALL false advertising. I don't know the brands in your country but I guarantee you have a hydroponics store within 30km of you if you're near a city, go there. Online brands like mars hydro and pro-gro are good, steer clear of spyderfarm/viparspectra/thin looking boards, they false advertise. Most drivers for 100W+ LED lights are at least the size of a small book.

>Fluorescent bulbs
1.2 to 1.6 umol/W

>HPS/CMH 
1.6 to 1.9 umol/W

>COB LED 
1.6 to 2.3 umol/W

>SMD LED 
1.9 to 3.0 umol/W

>23 x 66cm
>0.15sqm
>90umol for 600PPFD
>30-50W LED 

Obviously the light dissipates with the inverse square law, so these PPFD values are usually standardized for 60cm distance. 

If you want to start cheaply, get fluorescent bulbs with a driver rack, 24W x4 or anything else that gets you close to 100W. Do stick with SMD LEDs though if you are going to buy an LED. 100W SMD LED should never cost more than about $130 USD. Fluros probably less than $60.

It's literally tending a garden, it's pretty contemplative and mystic. Chan Buddhism has you tending gardens, mystics love using it as a metaphor in poetry.

Can you elaborate? Like others said, basic gardening is as easy as putting a plant in soil and watering it. What are you doing that is complicated?

My mother-in-law thinks that gardening is “complicated” because she is neurotic and thinks she needs to have every single part of a the process correct to get any good results. She constantly asks me completely worthless questions like how small to chop table scraps before putting them in the compost. She also never accomplished anything in the garden because she worries over the minutiae so much it paralyzes her. I have spent years saying “just get out there and plant something, just make a compost bed, just start some seeds, you will learn with experience!” No dice. She’s just neurotic and it can’t be cured.

You sound like her. Don’t be. If you think gardening is too complicated, but you still want to garden, by best advice is to do something that makes you completely uncomfortable, just do something without paying attention to almost any details. Go to the store and just buy a bunch of plants, let your only criteria be “they look cool” and then come home and plant them. Water then regularly and watch them grow or die. Take notes. The experience will help you more than anything.

My personal rule is always plant at least one thing that is retard proof and sure to succeed with minimal effort in your climate.
Then also plant at least one thing that is likely to fail due to not being optimal climate, fussy or whatever, but you like it or are interested in it.
You need guaranteed success to feel good, but you also need to explore and bush the boundaries or possibility.

I think gardening can be infinitely complex or extremely simple. You should only worry about the complexity if you are experienced and want to control details because it is fun. Let the complexity grow with you as a gardener. Do what they said and begin with some plants, and probably one of them should be idiot proof. When you have experience watering a plant and watching it grow, think about what aspect you enjoyed, what would you like to improve on? Soil quality? Get a bunch of pots and different soils and start testing germ and growth rates. Garden aesthetics? Build a diy raised bed. Composting? Start piling yard waste. 

There’s a million ways to go, but you should always start simple and let your complexity grow with your experience.

Any tips on turning these little apple boys into trees?
--- 2574653
>>2574650
You can graft onto them once they are a few years old. Apple seeds are not true to type, and unless it was an intentional hybrid seed your grocery store apples arent going to yield you very good genetics 

I think you can get a grafted apple tree for like $30, try that instead
--- 2574660
>>2574650
Dont listen to this >>2574653 guy. I fucking hate the gardening redditor's favorite saying that you shouldnt plant your own apples because "they dont grow true to type!!!1!!". Fuck 'em. Take the Johnny Appleseed pill and have fun experimenting. You can always graft later should you want to.
--- 2574665
>>2574660
lol

>>2574650
At least seek out good genetics if you really want to fuck around with breeding, go and get the farmers market varieties sold by the 70yr old johnny appleseeds, there's some good heritage genes in there, some even dying out. Just know that if you're only planting Red Delicious Costco Edition seeds you're going to spend 5 years on more mediocre fruit. Select your winners, you'll be able to tell which trees are worth keeping and which ones aren't after their 2nd spring. Try and grow them out in at least a 15L pot. If you have the space and you don't live in Alaska they should be ready to plant out after ~2 years, mulch heavily and protect the buds from frosts etc. When they fruit after a couple of years test your trees and breed your favorites, gotta make sure you don't just harvest Open Pollinated seeds, gotta isolate the flowers and label the fruit so you know which cross is which. Mothers are usually more dominant than Fathers, but you will get probably 2-4 dominant phenotypes from each batch of crosses. If you really cant plant them in the ground, I've seen apple trees fruit successfully in 50L pots, but that's with a grafted dwarf variety with lots of liquid fertilizer and TLC

Just seeds from apples I ate.
I was planning on growing these and waiting to see what they produce before grafting on some pink lady branches to the less tasty trees.
That should give me the variety needed for cross pollination right?

Will I get a deep taproot if I've planted in the dirt pods? The last time I tried this rabbits killed my seedlings so I think I'm going to replant into larger pots until they're sturdy enough not to die.

The more the merrier with OP breeding. Diversity over quantity, you can get some wild stuff! Get some welded wire sheets and make a shield when they go outside, I don't know if rabbits ring-bark plants but you should probably protect. Go all out on your potting soil too, trees really appreciate investment in the soil as they usually sit in the same pot for years

Cross pollination is a crapshoot with apples, there are pollination charts for named cultivars, but OP seed can be completely random, if your neighbors have apples though the bees will do that job for you.

First, some trivia.
It usually takes about a dozen of years from starting a seedling to its first fruit.
You need enough space to grow multiple trees to get one that tastes good.
These issues are what deters most people from growing apple trees from seeds. If you have space and patience – go for it.
If you don't have space &amp; patience, then do graft them.
And yes, cross-breeding nice trees yields better results.

Grafting apple trees is easy. You can graft a 1 year old sapling in late winter / very early spring (splice grafting). Don't aim for budding, not worth waiting for when you use a generative rootstock. Keep in mind that random rootstock will likely produce a full-size tree (rather than semi-dwarf or dwarf one), and you might need to wait longer for fruits.

> turning these little apple boys into trees
Growing apple trees from a seed is easy; they survive as long as they don't get overgrown by weeds and have sufficient water.
Any standard means for helping plants grow works for them. Calamities such as rabbits are not apple-specific.

> Will I get a deep taproot
The root system is genetically conditioned and does not really depend on growth condition.
That is one of the reasons why most apple rootstocks are vegetatively propagated.

By the way, why are your seedlings diicotyledon? True rebel apple seedling are tricotyledon! :)
(Or rather, were rebel. Now they are Cox's Orange Pippin.)

Anyone familiar with growing peppers know how long it takes to go from a seedling to the first set of true leaves?

What the best way of dealing with this? Do we dig a drainage ditch? Level the soil and hope it helps? I've had a few people suggest planting potatoes there just to break up the soil but I'm unsure.
--- 2575061
>>2575036
Tie to wire. I wouldn’t ever weave a plant through anything.

The weave method of tomato trellising refers to weaving string through a line of tomatoes. so you have stakes on either end of a line of tomatoes and as the tomatoes grow you should weave string through the tomatoes at increasing heights and anchor the string to the stakes.
--- 2575062
>>2575043
Yeah you may need to dig drainage canals to divert the water. Soil can be broken up by daikon radishes. Or, if it’s allowed, just build up on top of the soil like a lasagna garden

I meant seedlings that have gone astray and produced three first leaves instead of two as they are supposed to ;-) (See pic for another example.)
According to biologists a plant is either monocotyledon (literally: having one first leaf) or dicotyledon (literally: having two first leaves).
Some individuals just choose their own third path in this world of the two alternatives.

don't even waste your time and resources on these bro. you will waste years of your life and hundreds of dollars on nothing. there's a strong possibility that the fruit will not even be edible. If you want to get into making your own cultivars, try plants that don't take years to fruit.
--- 2575382
>>2575368
It looks like it's only been cold shocked so I'm guessing you were lucky and it didn't freeze that night when you left them outside. Tomatoes are resilient so they'll most likely recover. Look up how the harden off plants. It takes about 7-14 days so don't leave them outside over night until then and don't let them get battered by the wind and scorched by the sun in the meantime.

I was in college during the early days of Minecraft. I will be the first to admit that I was a dumbass as a college undergraduate. I played Minecraft for hours on end. Over time it slowly dawned on me that all this time shaping computer worlds could be used shaping the real world. When I left college I made sure I had a lawn and began gardening with one square raised bed. I found that doing actual work in the world is actually much more rewarding than Minecraft. I’m on my third property, second I’ve owned now, and with each one my skills have grown. Now I have a massive garden, chickens, a woodworking shop, and more.

Still, I feel like there is something easy to grow that I am completely missing here. Is there anything that I can add to this menagerie? Something weird, or out there, or uncommon, or the like. 

Anyone have luck with exotic or weird crops that can be grown in a normal garden?

I dunno, they hardly get any sunlight and the one that is older, you can see it's grown more leaves, so my guess is they will all get there with time.

what did you do to your starting soil there anon??? it looks really bad, but maybe it's just the lighting. If you're having trouble with your seedlings, you need to put them under an overhead grow light.

compacted clay soil thats somewhat dry

No growlights, only minimal light and sun from windows.
Anyway I don't really care about the peppers, the seeds a from a bell peper I ate and I don't really have a climate to grow them. So if they live they live and get a chance, if they die, they die.
It's mostly a test to see germination rates, how they handle soil conditions and so on.
All my more important seeds get a slightly better soil conditions.

thank you for this anon. exactly what I was looking for although I'm just gonna get my mom to grow it because she's the basil whisperer. Any other suggestions I can add to the cart? 

>>2575616
I see. Well now you know that most tomatoes and peppers are at pretty close to 100% germination rate. You could probably leave a bell pepper in the fridge for a month, eat the whole thing, then shit on the ground and they would all germinate. Probably the easiest to start out of them all.
--- 2575663
How much light do pepper plants need? Thinking of putting them inside my grow tent on cloudy days, i'm thinking 12 hours should be plenty?
--- 2575666
>>2575663
The last month and a half I start running my lights for 16 hours. 
I would imagine on cloudy days anything would be fine. We've had ours in the window the last two days due to high winds and heavy rain and they are doing fine.

>I see. Well now you know that most tomatoes and peppers are at pretty close to 100% germination rate. 
Sure but I'm also testing different soil conditions and what survives in them.
I also often take seeds, nuts, whatever I find and test if it's still germination viable, how does it handle different soils, whats the growth rate, temperature tolerance, moisture, such as flooding or too dry and seeing how plants grow and survive.
People will look at me grow stuff with no growth laps or dead in the winter and tell me its "too early". The fools... If they only knew my end game!

So more light during fruiting, good to know

Probably gonna put them behind the window on good days and in the tent on bad days. Could put them on the balcony, but that requires hardening them off, no?

I have crazy strong winds up here sometimes too.

Garden rototilled, planting some stuff tomorrow. But first I need to strip off the old deck sealer before it gets too hot out. City is having the annual compost giveaway at the end of next week so I need to clear out some of my container soil tubs.

Anything that seems novel, if you're looking to fill space. If you have any specific theme or goal in mind, then I could offer suggestions. Just be wary because a lot of what they offer is generic and is available cheaper elsewhere. Though that's a matter of a few bucks and throwing the dice.

For fruiting I'm not sure. I think I remember a bulb change may be needed as warmer light helps with fruiting. 
On the balcony would require them to be hardened off. Depends on how many you have and how large they are. We usually harden off quickly but putting our plants under a table so they get morning sun, no direct overhead sun and evening sun. We move them a little further out each day so they get more intense sun until the leaves no longer start to get soft and bend a little. 
these have been inside for three days now, weather is so shitty and cold no reason to stress them with high 30s and mid 40s with no sun during the day.

I had an odd phenomena happen last year. Normally, slugs and snails go after my strawberries. I decided to plant violas in with my strawberries just to fill up the area. The slugs and snails ignored by strawberries and went after the violas, which grew so aggressively it wasn't even an issue.
--- 2576106
Alright so since my mom already killed the lawn years ago I'm gonna start my veggies in the side of her house. What's the best approach here without me needing to spend a metric fuckton on soil? Boxes on top filled with soil? Dig it all up and place new shit? Use what's there and add fert? I'm a little lost on what I need to start figuring out here
--- 2576108

I mean if you are planting that many isn't it time to be looking at some farm equipment friend?

>Double digging is a gardening technique used to increase soil drainage and aeration. It involves the loosening of two layers of soil, and the addition of organic matter.

I'd say look into that, i grow in pots so i don't know too much about fucked up soil

Potatoes planted near the compost, 5 rows of carrots and 4 rows of onions at the far end, then garlic over by the trellis. I bought a seed dispenser so I used fewer packets of carrots than usual, I always plant them far too thick and can't be bothered thinning them.
--- 2576116
Carrots tucked in for 2 weeks to germinate. I even gave them a headboard.

First is making sure mommy doesn't till the devil's acre. Put the fear into her to the point she calls asking if she can water it.

You kidding?
Thats just some of the seeds and stuff I have to still plant.
May I remind you I planted 20kg of seed potatoes, 500g of peas and chickpeas. 
And many other stuff like carrots, cabbages, beets, radish, strawberry and other stuff.
Only equipment is a shovel and a rake.

I'v read some online source say you can plant potatoes 2-4 weeks before your last frost date, while other say the soil temp should at least be 8C.
How can both of those be correct, if the ground is freezing surely it's not 8C in there?
--- 2576210
>>2576196
For what it's worth I planted my sunchokes well before our last frost date. I think it even snowed a bit but the ground absolutely froze because I remember the soil expanded out of the pot a bit.

Why did this general come to /out/ and not /diy/

What's the lore?

Gonna plant some stuff for the very first time since I was a kid but I'm afraid my autism is getting the better of me. I read that you need pollinators around so plants can grow more fruit? I don't actually have any flowers in my backyard at the moment, what kind of flowers do bees like? Sunflowers? I've also read that lots of modern flowers are bred to be pollenless?
--- 2576282
>>2576260
Bees tend to like plants that put out clusters of flowers because they're a bit autistic and like to stick with a single type of plant when gathering pollen.
Social bees aren't the only pollinators, though. Flies pollinate. Wasps pollinate. Male mosquitos pollinate. If you have things going to flower, chances are something will check it out and pollinate it. Unless it's a weird case like with figs where they have like one species of wasp they live in a bizarre symbiosis with.

>>2576282
>they're a bit autistic and like to stick with a single type of plant when gathering pollen.
Thats because it's useful when you are pollinating to polinate the same species rather than mix completely different plants pollen and get apple polen mixed on tomatoes for example.

How the fuck do I stop my mint from getting this black growth on it? Other leaves have little black dots on then

Bee totally wrecked my pear plant on the balcony. All the flowers are raped.

On another note, lettuce is doing good, this pic is from a few days ago they're already larger than this now.

I've decided to build a bean trellis out of scrap wood I inherited from my grandpa. 

I'm using cut and pointed 2x4 as the stakes to ground it and 1x3s (2 sandwiched together for the bottom of the frame and mount for the stakes, singular ones for rest of outer frame) for the frame. I use wide head screws for assembly. I put extras every 5 inches and leave the top half inch or so of screw sticking out to run string inside the frame like picrel. I plan to put screw anchors on the mounting point of the fram to the base and stakes so that I can dissassemble them in winter.

2 questions. 
One, should I treat at least the stakes and bottom of the frame; if so what treatment would not contaminate the beans I intend to grow?
Two, is this design strong enough to withstand wind and whatnot? I imagine once loaded down with vines it will start to act almost like a sail in the right wind direction.

>Is it too late for this growing season?
literally just begun
don't let your soil be bare for too long, plant shit and mulch walkways 
a little late for onions but you can still try spring onions
perfect time for any root vegetables
beans
peas (maybe)
corn
brussel sprouts
celery
any herb
squash
pumpkins

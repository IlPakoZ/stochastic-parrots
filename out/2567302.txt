algorithm picks up things that don't deserve it all the time, it has nothing to do with quality of content. most youtubers now only talk about thumbnail, length, and title in terms of advertisement, because that's the only thing the algorithm looks for when deciding whether or not to push a video.

The amount of pot heads that live in the forest surrounding cities is massive. The off grid fandom actively seethe about these druggies because they dont chug tens of thousands into retarded homesteads and just illegally poach and live off the land. When they get caught they get a slap on the wrist like the nigs they are because it’d be too expensive to keep them locked up

I've never met a pothead who was responsible with money or who had his priorities in order. For them, it's weed > everything else.
--- 2567343
>>2567331
He was going to have that glass regardless if he was camping or not and should obviously not be listed as a cost of entrance to potheads living on the edge of society
--- 2567349
>>2567339
That's a tautology. If you didn't judge a person to have "weed > everything else" priorities, you wouldn't describe that person as a pothead. You aren't talking about users of marijuana, you're talking about people who make marijuana use the core of their identity.
>>2567343
>He was going to have that glass regardless if he was camping or not
I would give seven to two odds that he wouldn't bring that bong if he wasn't recording for YouTube. Joints, blunts, and bowls, sure, but that glass is a prop.

Tbhfam all the milemaxing and beakbagging came when I was much older. What got me interested in camping was smoking dope and being free. I don't hate these dorks. They are idiots and I would recommend they show some restraint. But who among us couldn't have shown some restraint when we were 25.

Amen. I love car camping, bushcraft channels are fun to watch but it's way more fun to just park under a tree and set up a tent a few yards away. Plus you get all those wonderful cooking smells from your neighbors and you can take a stroll among the all-white people and admire all the little glowy lamps hanging from their RVs.

Generally when a video has lots of views its either truly exceptional content, or comes from someone doing videos for many years.

You can probably guess what category RawOG420 falls into. He's been uploading videos regularly for 7 years. What looks like lazy, cash-grab content is actually a years-long labor of love, speaking to his passion and dedication. It takes a lot of work to keep a project going for so long, and several hundred thousand loyal subscribers were his reward.

It could possibly cost 100 times as much or a fraction of the cost of that tent. When I was a pothead, I ordered chinese knock off bongs from DHgate. I did know other fellow retarfs who paid over $1000 for dab rigs and bongs.

What is it with Americans making /out/ such a MUH SURVIVAL TACTICOOL MARINE NAVY SEAL TIER 1 OPERATOR SHTF APOCALYPSE PREPPER LARPfest?
Most other people just go /out/ to have a fun relaxing time, enjoying life, meditating and all that.
But you mutts always act like you´re some Tier 1 operator, who is prepping for "le ebic SHTF".
It shows in the style of your youtube videos.
Go watch any /out/ YT video from a mutt, and its gonna be some fat retard who never made it through basic training, going on and on about survival, wearing a buzzcut, tacticool gear, and acting like there´s a soviet spetznaz team on his fucking trail.
Then watch your average canadian or European /out/ youtuber, and it´s all about having a good time, totally relaxed and all that.

Marijuana addicts are so retarded and pathetic. This is why some people die when they go camping. This yahoo will one day overdose on Marijuana in the woods and get himself killed in a fit of delusion and paranoia thinking a wedigo is coming after him or something.

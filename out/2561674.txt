I think this is something like I used. Basically you just need to choose battery, color, and flood level (whatever it's called can't think of it).

NU20 is great, I'm going to pick up a handful of them to stuff some prep kits when they come out with the usb c refresh. You can't do better for the weight and water resistance, obviously it's not a general use light.

Petzl and Zebralight
They last for 20+ years. My oldest is 15 years old.

nigcore is trash.

You want the flood and warmth for trail illumination. so a "fd". H600Fd. The H604d has maybe too much flood and doesnt shine as far. Also buy a 18650 batterie that you can charge via USB.

>>2562828
The petzl actik intrigues me for the rechargeable battery. The Nitecore nu25 has been great though. Light, good power, reasonable life and cheeeeap.

i bought some piece of shit off aliexpress for $8. works, probably wont when I need it most but thats a problem for another day
--- 2562966
>>2561674 (OP)
Any recommendations for a headlamp that works with AAA batteries and has a red light in addition to white light? Earth tone colours or just black for the headband etc would be great.
--- 2563030
>>2562931
some aliexpress pieces of shit are really good anon. some examples:
nitecore and fenix = same quality as MITUSA lights
thrunite = close to western brand quality &amp; ahead of all the western brands on specs/tech right now
convoy = best poorfag flashlights in existence, used to be even cheaper but /g/ and reddit memed them leading to price hikes

>a bit more punch for the fog
it doesn't work that way anon.
a brighter light will have even less visibility in fog because it reflects more of the fog back at you.
that's why when you're driving a car and it gets foggy you're supposed to turn OFF your high beams and activate your fog lights, which are low mounted and even dimmer than your low beams.

for a flashlight good in fog the features you want to look for are:
- warm light color. cool light scatters more.
- a headlamp with a mode that has a bit less lumens, than whatever mode on the nitecore is blinding you.
- something easy to take off and hold in your hand. tube ones are nice but anything without an annoying to use headband works.
and also just try just using the medium or low setting if you're blasting high or extra high mode into fog with the nitecore anon. it should be a pretty ideal headlamp for fog.
also your nitecore has usb pass through, you can make its battery last days by plugging it into a battery bank. when you do that it just skips the internal battery instead of charging it so you get 100% efficiency. nitecore and anker make the best battery banks IME if you don't have one. but any solid looking chinkshit is fine. 
anyways petzl invented the modern headlamp, they're made in france, and they still make the best headlamp for everything except really specialty stuff you'd want a $1000 helmet mount light for like overhead environment diving imo. i'll shill them. 
>>2562966
zebralight has the best aaa lights. petzl actik is good and does all that too.
--- 2563037
>>2562828
the only problem with zebralight is they're only worth buying in america.
their overseas shipping is either very expensive or not offered and they have bad customer support if you're not domestic. if you live in america they have pretty decent customer support.
also zebralight is made in china. if you've ever had to send one back they make you send it to china not texas. look it up. its an american company but not MITUSA. 
they're really good flashlights imo 2nd best brand in terms of dependability but don't be mistaken they're chinese lights look it up.

general advice: petzl is the best for eurofags. petzl and zebralight for americans. the big chink brands are good too, saying they're not these days = clueless. proof being you guys all like zebralight l0l.

Oh okay, so Petzl is the way to go then it seems. I am Finnish so I guess I should have mentioned that as well. How well do the Petzls withstand moisture? Also I assume that petzls have decent helmet mounts available?

waterproofing varies model to model with their headlamps.
what kind of helmet? they do sell mounts for various types of helmets but make sure before you buy and check compatibility.
what's your use case? if you're using it for specialized stuff like diving, caving, etc let me know, you want different lights for some of those things and what brands are good changes a lot.

Well, it would go on a bicycle helmet not really for /out/ing, but I commute all around the year with my bicycle. 
The red light and a possibility for low lumen setting is something that I'd want for night trekking and weekend warrior larping as a reservist. 
I was thinking of a sort of a multi use headlamp for all purposes. I guess it doesn't need to be too specialized.
--- 2565145
>>2565140
they only have 2 lamps with bike helmet compatibility and they're $350/750 huge boi ones. you might wanna ask some cyclingfags what they use, i know a lot of people just stretch a normal lamp over their helmet, but i don't know much about lamps that actually mount -> generic cycling helmets.
--- 2565146
if you want a general all rounder i know a lot of helmet mount lights use external battery packs, which are kind of counter intuitive to a general use light, so keep that in mind when researching.
--- 2565156
>>2565140
Having commuted for 6 years on a bike, strapping lights to the bike itself is the better option. Light on the head can be useful but part of a light's job is alerting cars to you and a bright headlamp/back light does that better. Plus a lot easier to get a significantly brighter light and no worries about making something working on your helmet.

I like my h600Fc 4000k. Its like a smooth even wall of light in front of me. Having the frosted lens with the reflector -kinda- center weights the flood effect, but its a very smooth transition from the center to the perimeter of the beam. Very wide, but on the highest setting it still punches out 50+ meters in front of me. No slouch, but it does get very hot very quickly at that setting. The lower-medium setting is good for walking around cleared areas/trails with good illumination to about 10-15m depending on ambient light levels. The medium high setting is great for walking around in the open. Literally my only complaint is that the single click on always turns it to high. Mode memory would be great, but at least the UI lets you click-and-hold to start at low and cycle upward in output from off. Tailcap lockout works great when in my bag. I like it so much I bought a second for use while working. Glued a magnet to the tailcap to make it a bit more versatile. If you need more throw, get the non frosted lens version, the H600C, and put a layer of matte scotch tape over the lens to get a similar diffusing effect that you can peel off when you need to.

I have one that looks real similar, sofrin SP40, bright, cool and all and it stopped working. I really like the form factor, but I am never spending over 20 dollars on a headlamp again. If its anything more for a candling device, it'll be for a massive flashlight that has no settings, only an an on-off switch
--- 2566481

I would rather keep my bicycle as bare as possible because I will forget the light on it and then a junkie will steal it from me. I work with them on daily basis and they will steal anything. 
>>2565145
>>2565146
I have a skateboarding helmet because I hate cycling fags and their attire. I figure I could attach a construction mount on it with double sided tape. I will find an other mean of lighting up my commutes if petzl is not the way. The other two usages were for trekking at night and weekend warrior larp as a reservist. So, the AAA compatibility is more important (the military gives us as many batteries as we need for our devices, as long as they are in AA/AAA). That's also why I'd want the red light and low lumen outputs and decent waterproof rating.
--- 2566484
>>2562828
seconding Petzl. I use the Tikka, wich can be either used with three AAA or a rechargeble battery. I do regret not getting the Tactikka wich comes with a red light, i might have to grab one of those sooner or later.

American stuff is generally good, but it's expensive in Europe and sometimes it's overengineered because they put their heart and soul into it, even if it's just a simple slingshot for instance. That's no bad thing though.

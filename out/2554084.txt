I've never felt creeped out by hikes or camping trips abroad. But I often get creeped out in the US and Canada. And I think I had a legitimate encounter with a feral man in Tennessee. I guess part of it might be the vastness of the forests and the wilderness but even so when you get "that feeling" it feels deeper than that. 

I was camping in the Unaka mountain wilderness area and I had a feeling I was being watched. This was a single night hike and I was on the verge of turning around because I just started feeling sick. Not as in feeling ill but I sensed in my stomach something was wrong like I was being watched. When I went to sleep I was frozen with fear in my tent and I heard shuffling outside and just lay there sweating like crazy. I left a pool of sweat even though it wasn't hot out. When I woke up there were prints all around my tent - they weren't boot prints they were in the shape of a human but were flat like somebody was wearing moccasins or something. 

To this day I am convinced this was a feral person, which have been known to exist in Appalachia. 

Anybody else feel way more creeped out in North American forests than when they camp abroad? You'd think it would be the other way around due to familiarity. And have any Euros felt creeped out in North America?

How is it mental illness. Feral people are documented and it's a first hand experience. Also, many more people go missing in the US Wilderness and many who are found have stories about feral people, or people who hide behind trees. Trust me it's real and I saw it myself. I always get the creeps worse than I had it before when camping now.

I live in Appalachia and I have seen several things on my hikes that never made any sense. Shifting landscapes, light rods flying past during the day, laughter in the woods, silence so deep that you feel it. The woods of Appalachia are old and plenty of spooky ghosts.

In Canada, yes. Mid and Southern US is fine. There is a difference between feeling creeped out because of a moose or bear nearby and feeling "creeped out" like in your story.

The only thing that came close to my Canada experience in Europe was in the Finnish Lappland near the Russian border. This is no man's land, 
No trails, no humans, only swamps, hills, birch forests, moose and bear. I had not seen another person for five or six days. It was early in the morning already light out and I was sleeping with my head against the inner and outer tent fabric. Suddenly my dream starts to get lucid and I dream/hear someone chanting, repetitive like a shaman. Something is pressed against my neck and I wake up. I don't move. Chanting continues. Eventually he releases my neck from the outside and I hear him walk away. It felt like he marked or blessed me for something good and bad at the same time. I didn't lose the feeling for the rest of the trip even today maybe.

Do you live somewhere with nonFeral People? I grew up in Siskiyou County California and now I live in the Mississippi Bayou and there were/are plenty of Feral People in both. No land taxes, no sales taxes, no income taxes, no healthcare taxes, no disability taxes, no social security taxes, just people living, and yes most of them wear moccasins. If a Feral Person isn’t wearing moccasins they’re probably a murderer and will make you a part of an urban legend to steal your boots.

--- 2554164
Oh grow the fuck up already. There's no such thing as feral people. And all the stories have been greatly exaggerated by the shock media. The disappearances in USA wilderness is entirely due to it's vastness compared to Europe. If feral people existed there would be better evidence. And just because some hick police think it's true isn't evidence. Quit spreading this utterly ridiculous BS. People will start to blame county commissioners who are innocent.

--- 2554172
>>2554167
No. As somebody who grew up around feral people you're being disrespectful. Feral people are people who live in the woods and are defensive of their territory. They usually can't speak well anymore. They're not fucking meth cooks how would they get their fix deep in the woods? What OP is exactly what you should do if you're being tracked. Don't panic, don't threaten them, don't act scared. Walk until you're out of your territory. They probably will take a look at your camp but it's rare they kill or kidnap anybody (but it can happen).

PNW forests, especially old growth forests like the Hoh rain forest, are probably some of the comfiest, most serene, in touch with God and nature that you can be anon. The silence is deafening because you are in an area that (if hiking through national forest land) may not have had anyone in that spot for decades if not centuries. Absolute shame the states of Oregon and Washington, once the end of the Oregon trail where only the hardiest and most driven people flocked too are now liberal nanny states ruined by transexual communists who are not only the antithesis to nature, but actively despise it.

My buddy and I were camping very remote, late winter PNW. He dreampt of hands pressing along the outer walls of tent, hands feeling his ears/shoulder. I woke to geurilla hooting to my right, then a deep gutteral voice rebuking the hooter just behind/above me. I too laid in shocked terror for about 2 hours until i couldnt handle it anymore, go out fighting. The two creatures thrashed outta there fast when i started yelling. Could be feral folk but I believe in bigfoot. 100%, though be he terrestial or visitor I dunno

You will keep scrambling to find any excuse to avoid posting photo evidence that you go outside - because you don't have any. Because you don't actually go outside.
And deep down, you know that I know, and you also know that the other anons that read this will also know you don't go outside. You'll feel embarrassed and you'll seethe repeatedly, still replying to this in a desperate bid to convince yourself that you didn't fail at something as basic as hiking. You've embarrassed and disappointed yourself enough today.

How do you grow up around feral people? Aren't they incredibly rare, especially nowadays?
--- 2554383
>>2554369
If you grow up in certain bumfuck hick areas of the US you might run into them. You probably won't run into them in your town unless they are really fucked for food (which is rare because they are masters of living outdoors). But if you hunting and do multi-day treks and things like this you might come across them. I grew up in deep mountain country and it was known there were feral in the woods. My dad was never afraid of them and we were tracked multiple times during our camping and hunting trips. My dad would leave out supplies for them like matches. But they almost never took it - it's more to show good will. You have to remember, feral people weren't born feral. They are loner hermits who go to the woods usually after turning 18 or after some catastrophic life event. They feel pride on doing things without help so they probably won't take your "gift" you leave out. But it's a good way to say "I know you're here, I"m not messing with you, I come in peace." Because they have been living tax free and off the gov's radar, often breaking fish and wildlife regulations they're very paranoid of people.
--- 2554384
>>2554383
But also I don't want to paint a rosy picture. Not all ferals are harmless hermits. A lot of disappearances in Appalachia are due to feral humans, especially girls.
--- 2554387
>>2554084 (OP)
OP, that looks comfy as fuck.

--- 2554388
>>2554387
Why are retards in this thread acting like just because something is comfy doesn't mean it can't be creepy? A lot of the comfiest places are filled with the most bizarre disappearances. Nobody said it's not comfy or beautiful or fun, if it wasn't I'm sure OP wouldn't be hiking despite his scary experience with a feral human.
--- 2554391
>>2554388
Because being creeped out is synonymous with being uncomfortable you obnoxious troon
--- 2554396
>>2554391
Wrong. I've been in comfy areas and heard strange things and still enjoy my time. Being scared of a feral person or a strange occurrence doesn't preclude you from enjoying the nature itself. The adrenaline can even add to the experience.
--- 2554400
>>2554388
It's not creepy at all, that looks inviting and beautiful. 

You have issues if woodlands like that make you uneasy.
--- 2554404
>>2554400
You guys, once again, are misinterpreting it. The look of the forest is not the creepy party. It's what HAPPENS in the forest. It's not the trees that are scary. It's the feral people and disappearances, the screams, the shadow people etc. I've never seen this in Europe. And in places like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. even Maine I've never felt creeped out. This is mostly about deep Appalachia and what goes on there.

Also you kind of sound like a faggot

--- 2554728
>>2554479
>aura
Typical crystal-gazing, navel-gazing, self-obsessed New Age bullshit. My Mom was into that crap for decades until she got the menopause and realized no amount of meditation, aura massages, yoga, and incense would restore her youth, grant her immortality, or fetch her a new man post-divorce and post-eggs. She's really weaned herself off that claptrap in recent years. It's all quite ironic, because New Age shit heavily apes Buddhism (superficially, that is), and Buddhism is about NOT gazing at your navel and NOT becoming attached to physicality. Women are of course unable to understand this as a whole gender.

Anyway, the Earth doesn't care about you at all. There is no aura or vibe; it's all in your head. The Earth didn't care about the Permian extinction, it didn't care about the Cretaceous extinction, it didn't care when homo sapiens out-competed the Neanderthals, it didn't care when Native Americans genocided each other, it didn't care when white men genocided the Native Americans, and it doesn't care about the Holocene extinction (i.e., what we 8 billion human cockroaches are doing to flora and fauna right now).

In 50 million years, we and almost every trace of our civilization will be gone, there'll be whole new continental configurations, new species of flora and fauna, and the Earth still won't care. Pure egotism to think that nature gives a damn about you one way or the other.

Well, it's a big place. Canada and the US are like twice as big as all of Europe. 

There's stories around where I live, northern Rocky mountains, about a guy who does this shit. Basically, when a person is camping alone, or just 2 people, and they're drinking and such, and not if they have dogs, he finds a chance to sneak up and put something in the bottle that makes them pass out.

I've never heard any stories about him raping them or anything, he just takes pictures of them asleep with their phones, steals some cash and food, and leaves them alone besides that.

I used to think this was just a local legend, because the stories were always like "my friend's cousin's boyfriend" and shit like that, but then it happened to a friend of mine and I saw the pictures myself. 

My opinion is that it's a Kaczynski kind of guy who has taken a different approach.

As gay as the states are, Europe has it worse. I laugh when people call China a surveillance state, while England has more cameras per square mile, (or square kilometer, if you prefer) than China

Anyway, ain't no reason to make a dick measuring contest out of it. The US may have less cameras but they're still watching us all the time, in other ways. We're all getting fucked. The only question is, when will we do something about it?

>The only question is, when will we do something about it?
As the old adage goes, civilization is only nine (or seven, or three) missed meals away from anarchy. When people get hungry, and especially when their children get hungry, then they'll be ready to burn down the palatial estates of the elite.

Of course, these days, it's often too late by the time things get that far, because we're better at providing cattle feed to the poor than in ancient times; and of course we have globalism and planes now, so the elite will simply flee like the parasitic cowards they really are. The only consolation is that they'll spend the rest of their lives as strangers in a strange land always looking over their shoulders, because the world will quickly forget them, but their people will not and those people will be out for revenge (if they can get it).

I live in southern Appalachia and I think these fruits are coming down here from NOVA to "experience a wild and spiritual journey of personal growth," but then they lie down on their $600 worth of doubled-up self-inflating mattresses and let Deliverance, a few specific X-Files episodes, and Sasquatch and ghost hunter shlock TV shows run their imaginations wild.

Absolutely useless way of comparing countries. You put cameras where the people are. China is fucking huge. Everyone lives near the coast in the south. There are vast deserts where no one goes. England is really small. Every square inch has been inhabited since Roman times.

I've spent a lot of time in forests in many different parts of the US and Canada. Appalachia easily the creepiest, but I'd put the dense damp literal rainforests of the PNW as second. I've had encounters with "hill folk" in the Cascades that would rival any WV holler or Ozark backwoods, people that look very clearly "devolved." A far lesser known creepy woods spot is the Uinta Range in NE Utah, this is not far from the Skinwalker Ranch and I've never had such a strong feeling that I was being watched.

Most sounds are explainable. Sometimes the woods fucks with the noise of a trickling stream to make it sound like someone, eternally out of line of sight, is talking. Animal calls are warped in unusual ways to sound like vehicles, and sometimes that twig that snapped just decided to do so on its own. That silence though... I've never found an explanation for those moments when you feel like screaming wont make a sound.

Idk I live in Michigan. Parents have 40 acres of land, never once camped in it because it gives myself and others the heebie jeebies at night. During the day all is well.

There is nothing spooky in the woods. Animals are terrified or curious of you, and the people are friendly. Abandon the trail anon, go bushwhacking. Venture further and experience places most people dont even know exist. Don't be afraid of some trees, anon, its not like you work in the logging industry or something.

Kind of reminds me of the conservation areas surrounding Toronto in the so called greenbelt. They logged the shit out of Southern Ontario decades ago, and re-planted the forests with fast growing pines, cedars and maples all in big rows with very little diversity. Many of the trails now tend to feel pretty sterile and monotonous as a result, very far away from nature. Although it's still a breath of fresh air (literally) getting out of the city when you don't have time for a longer trip.

>A far lesser known creepy woods spot is the Uinta Range in NE Utah
The Uinta Mountains are a magical place. One of the few mountain ranges in North America to run East to West. Lots of memories solo hunting and backpacking deep in the numerous basins it has to offer, and climbing the high ridges into some deadfall hell holes I should've never been in. Creepiest places I've experienced have been on the North Slope in those high open meadows and some of the lakes. Had some really strange feelings when I camped alone at one of the lakes one night. Felt a wash of relief once morning came and I hiked out. Other than that I've never really experienced anything out of sorts either on the North or South Slope.

I road my bike down a forest service trail for about 5 miles then just decided to park my bike and just start walking in the woods. I got about 2 miles in when I came across a straight opening that just seemed out of place, it's just in the middle of the pic, so I followed it. It was a lot easier to walk on and I just hiked around the water. The whole time it felt creepy.

Then I came across an old submerged bridge. I noticed super old stumps with no tree next to them so I'm guessing they just made the bridge as they went along. I go off trail all the time and am never creeped out, I hunt, so I just left. Supposedly there was a paper mill and somehow, from what I was told, the sawdust exploded in a building. They weren't sure but said up to 50 people died, this was early 1900's. Forests can be creepy as fuck sometimes.

I lived in Oregon and Washington for about 7 years total retard, from Springfield and Lane County to Portland to Seattle and out near the OP for a bit. Have you driven out east from Seattle towards the pass? Cutting down the woods to build shitty, ugly condos. With more treats getting cut down the water ways get blown out. Combined with littering and more trash, this has been brutal for steelhead breeding and their grounds. 
Aside from that, both Oregon and Seattle control the politics of the state and if you can't see how detrimental that has been not only to the environment but personal freedoms over the last 20ish years, you are also retarded and gay. The OP, national parks/forests, and other vast swaths of Oregon and Washington are still mostly undestroyed, true, but that is only because the consuming plague that are the residents of Seattle and Portland haven't been forced out of their pods yet to move farther out.

Also, add in that how many of these "people" who live in these states and vote their way actually care about the environment? Not only do these obese, transexual slobs stay in their le 15 minute cities, the amount of strain they put and destruction on the environment is insane
>buying brand new plywood overpriced condos that had the woods cut down to live in
>new EV that not only is immensely harmful to create, but also puts huge strain on electrical grid
>food delivery services, buy everything from Amazon/Whole Foods, work do nothing tech jobs, etc.
But it is ok cause even though they are doing the equivalent of lighting tires on fire, they buy le carbon offsets so it works out! These people destroy the environment, they only care about it so they can virtue signal about how much they care and so they can go to local trailheads for grinder photos.

¥urop's witch and werewolf hunting was an urban affair. And yes like all spoops it's based in superstition or dogma, but frankly it doesn't compare to the endless and untrustworthy wild of the New World. those fuckers who boated across to Virginia and New England, literally IN the age of enlightenment, and found nothing but the tortures of the elements, wily natives, and endless continent before them, those people can be forgiven for truly fearing the woods and wondering where and how the Devil will encroach on them there. 

in my own town in MA there's a spat of land known as the cedar meadow, aka "the witch woods". all the farms from the 1600s end at the cedar meadow, they never went into it. today all the old stone walls run blindly through the forest but they all border at the cedar meadow because people were afraid to go into that land and clear it, and so it has never been cleared. I personally have trekked through and it's the only place I feel truly vulnerable; you can't stand up straight and you can't see what's in front of you or behind you. just dense fucking cedar branches with barely any room to breathe. FUCK the witch woods

pickeral, google map in spring shows how this played out. if you look closely you can see the stone walls skirting the cedar meadow. and also be mindful that this shit isn't nearly as intimidating via satellite, you kinda have to be there

Same. Born and raised in the mountains, and for all the social media posing I've seen from mostly fat people, I've never once seen anything paranormal. And I always wanted to. 
Closest to paranormal I ever really felt was going into the entrances of some old caves with just my dog, and you look in, and your brain tells you that there is someone there watching you. You can see shadows move, and you walk in some and it retreats back into the cave.
As an adult, I learned about how the brain works and finds faces in things. As a kid though, I was positive that there was some underground people lurking in them.

>those people can be forgiven for truly fearing the woods and wondering where and how the Devil will encroach on them there
Yes, forgive them for hurting your personal materialistic dogma by trying to survive known threats like savages. They were just silly gooses, they didn't know they could have been making toilet paper and science textbooks from the trees they relied on for food, protection, housing, tools, medicine, and spiritual guidance. Forgive the hunter-gatherer societies that survived to the modern day by this method but had to watch their neighbors become decimated by war, disease, and slavery at the hands of the wonderful science gurus who put microplastics in our food, chemicals in the air, petroleum and mountains of waste in the oceans, and mutilate children to keep them from commiting suicide.

thanks anon, twas a very nice place to grow up †bh. it's still my dad's pride. back in 1978 he ordered the house from a catalogue and sure as shit the company showed up with trucks over several weeks dropping off piles of logs, lumber, and building materials in heaps on the plot. my dad hired a guy to dig the foundation, and company came and poured the concrete, and once that set he hired two random duded and a small crane and over the next 11 months the three of them followed the instructions and built the goddamn house together. it was leaky and drafty for years until every detail was finished, but my parents were legit able to live in the house that first winter even before it was done.

back in 1978 the entire operation cost $30k. the furnace alone was $10k and to this day it's the best part. it's big enough where you could walk into it if you wanted and we burn oil, wood, or coal and it's always cozy af because we harvest wood all year an have cords and cords drying for years at a time

kek for the first 10 or so years of my life our floors were cheap shitty plywood, with cracks and holes where you could see through to the basement. as kids we just accepted it but it was fucking scary and I used to get wood splinters in my feet so bad my parents would have to hold me down to cut them out of my feet. The whole time my dad used bitch about Carter. "well thanks to Carter, wood shortages were so bad we couldn't even afford American plywood, these floors are garbage plywood from Romania" he used to say.

Thanks so much for sharing anon, it's nice to hear your take. I wish I had a photo of the furnace. It's been serviced often but still is going great. I love the deep cold days of winter where my dad would shut the oil off and just toss logs in. The house is never more comfy and the wonderful smell. Dang.

I guess we are probably near the same age but my father died a year ago. 

You can see how the previous unit was about three times as large. Was very useful in its day but heat pumps/ac is just so much more efficient now. Was a game changer.
--- 2567565

Yeah we must be. An upgrade is always worth it, especially when it comes to cost and efficiency. I live in a different country now but for the time being my parents are staying put in the house, and there's no chance my dad cares about doing any upgrades. I wish I had the cash to buy them out and keep that house as my New England getaway, but I definitely can't.

Sorry to hear about your dad anon, only a year ago and that must be tough. I can't even imagine that.

I live in the lad of King Philip's War and the amount of death, terror, and utter atrocity perpetrated by the unjuns and the colonists is hair raising. small villages way out alone in the New England wilderness getting torched in the night with everyone burning to death in their homes. the injuns would cut one leg off all the livestocck and set them to roam the forest, they would tear the clothing off the colonists, men women and children, and butcher them like pigs in the mud. they would cut their fingers off and scatter them along the roads amongst bloody bible pages as a warning to any colonists approaching. they would cut the hands and feet off anyone caught on the road days away from the nearest town, leaving them to squirm around in the mud until they died of exposure or were eaten by animals.

20 or more towns were destroyed, 10% of the european population was killed, and the destruction got so close to Boston they considered building a stockade wall around the entire city with the intention of holding out just long enough to evacuate and abandon the colony altogether. when they finally organised and got the upper hand they destroyed the indians without mercy. they burned their children alive in the dead of winter and quite literally exacted genocide. King Philip's head sat on a pike in Boston for like 30 years until it disintegrated. you go off in the woods here and sit in the dirt and aside from the comforts of nature around you, it just feels very heavy sometimes.

Cameras everywhere is a given nowadays. It's what you do with the info on the cameras that is the problem. Despite all the corruption and bullshit, Western countries really do have some civil liberty protections that China does not, especially the US. You are still more likely to be jailed in China for political dissent than in the UK, and more likely there than in the US.

>inb4 US prison population
That's all because of the War on Drugs. I believe it's ridiculous and draconian too, but if you're not a crack addicted nigger it's way easier to stay out of prison here thanks to the Bill of Rights. Yes, they violate it all the time, but they have to be sneaky about it, and it can still be used to foil their attempts to prosecute you for bullshit. You don't have that protection in China.

There's a place like this where I go often. We just never went down one road and across the river because we thought it was private land. Were quite happy about that. Then I learnt that it was public land. So we went for a drive down there, didn't get out of the truck at all. Was weird, vibes not like the nice vibes in the other direction. Didn't stop till we got back across the creek and we had a cup of tea there, vibes felt better. Old gold mining country.

The biggest thing around me is the weed grower fags. They bought the land super cheap with the sole purpose of growing pot, so rarely do they maintain their fences or access roads and it could be easy to wonder into their land. This has happened to me a couple times, the biggest giveaways were me being able to see a shed, greenhouse, or clearing in the distance. Sometimes they will even encroach on public land (or at least very close) so sometimes one has to scout the area for any clandestine clearings on the satellite maps and be careful to not get too close. 
These people are a weird mix of wannabe wiggers and hicks. They kind of feed off the reputation some sensationalist "documentaries" painted them to be, and seem to still think that the growing business is as lucrative as it used to be (its been heavily declining for the past years). I'm so glad weed became legal here so these fucks can go out of business.

>>2570386
last couple summers here (southern OR) have been quite dry, and the pot farmers were either going out of business (lol) or stealing water from muni supplies in order to stay afloat. 

legalization has been a disaster for people wanting to buy smaller plots of land as well, as a lot of the &lt; 10 acre plots were snapped up for cheap by FOMOing wannabe pot growers. hoping they all go under and normal people can get cheap land again.

Well anon, the best book on the matter is widely considered to be Jill Lepore's The Name of War. She won awards for her research and the focus on historical accounts, and the language used and the way written discourse changed at the time as bascially a reflection of the horror and mortality unlike anything these people had ever faced. Her historical accounts are put together so well that the story of the war was finally insightful and cohesive rather than just a telling of known events. She also documents the oral accounts and history of the natives of the time. I've never really seen or heard about at least 70% of it and I've been KPhW buff for a long time and have read 3 books on the matter. Definitely check it out. Also good is L.T. Brooks' Our Beloved Kin; a more overall and general account but with additional uncovered research and accounts.

If you like this sort of thing I would encourage you to watch Jill Lepore's talk in Worcester, where she discussed the history and origins and of the war and of course promotes her new book. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say her work does for KPhW what Last of the Mohicans did for the French &amp; Indian War, or in a way what Dances with Wolves did for the Plains Indians. The 2-dimensional account of colonists bullying, abusing, and encroaching on Indians is true but absolutely much more complicated. This war didn't erupt for over 50 years after the Puritans colonized, things were actually manageable for a couple generations but then shit just went off.

The full version of her talk is here:

I was raised as a redneck and find the forests very comforting honestly.

Not gonna lie brother you sound kinda soft if you are frightened by rural people just existing, like in Tucker and Dale vs Evil, it is kinda funny.

There is reservation land in Appalachia that still live off the land in the traditional Indigenous way, and there are some mountain people that get by on very little or even no money at times.

Still human beings. Not “feral people” for living in a traditional way in a natural, un-polluted environment. You go into the cities and people are left out homeless in the cold. That’s savagery, the greed and indifference of modern society. Not Jim Bob who just wants to live innawoods and be left alone.

Europe minus Russia and even Scandinavia has 3-4 times as many brown bears as the lower 48 of the US and twice as many wolves. Europe also has about twice as many moose as the US as a whole. US farmers and hunters absolutely decimated the populations about 100 years ago and they are barely recovering and 3 states they are starting to recover unlimited tag hunts have reopened which will halt and reverse their recovery. The lower 48 of the US does have a lot more game like black bears, coyote, deer (over twice as much), mountain lion and about the same number of elk size game (red deer) compared with Europe though. Another common misconception is that Europe has less forest, it actually has slightly more total forest than the US as a whole, it's just mostly concentrated in eastern and northern Europe and has much less wilderness or continuously unbroken wild areas.

If you like the ocean there's tons of nice shoreline and deep sea fishing and stuff which is a lot more fun than it sounds and the times I've been I've caught so many god damn cod, eels, and shark that I almost couldn't fit it all in the freezer

These ones are my favorite, Mountain Nei Nei, they have these bendy appendages that look like they have heads on the end and all ways seem to look different every time you walk past the same one. Bark looks like skin. I make up story's to myself about Nei Nei man and freak myself out...

I had an experience last time I went backpacking. I was sleeping and woke up in the middle of the night, heard something or someone say something like "hey watch this" and my tent started shaking like crazy, like someone was outside just shaking the shit out of it. Creeped me out. Still can't tell if it was a dream or not.

were you camping along a trail or a designated camping area or was this totally randomly in the middle of the woods?

also ßump limit reached, which is sad because this has been my favourite thread on /out/ the last month and a half :[

I don't usually believe in spirits in my day to day life but when I'm hiking in the forest it's fun to think about all the spirits that are whispering around me. It also makes me respect the forest even more because I don't want to upset any of them.

The Appalachian mountain ranges have been around millions of years, stretching back to pangea, if the supernatural exists, no doubt theres been some creepy shit there

Can confirm. Its like no other, specifically the old pangean Appalachian range, although the rest of the forests are fine. I go /out/ in the bush at night (Aussie) and all I worry about is snipers and running into some rabid abo, I've been to japan and all the asian countries, their forests are almost inviting even in pitch black. But the US, Canada, Some of iceland and the highlands are just different. No doubt some freaky ancient shit going on there.

why are you trying to turn me on!

Despite that I find 85% of these adult campfire stories to be fake and gay, I will admit that the Appalachian mountains do have this eeriness to them that I can't explain. I am much more on edge camping in them then when I was in the Rockies or Cascades even though both of those ranges contain much more dangerous critters and geography.

Satanic trips of truth
I had some "fun" experiences with sleep deprivation where the involuntary twitching of your eye convinces you that inanimate objects are moving, or that the shadows shifting in the corner are strange people. Felt sort of poetic when I was in the woods, felt lurid when I was in my shitty apartment

I was camping in a designated spot, I was at a trail camp with 3 other people in my campsite but I know they wouldn't do that since none of us knew eachother that well.

sounds like someone was passing through at night an having a larff. they wouldn't do that nowadays on account of the strict shoot-first-ask-questions-never policy sweeping the nation

Thanks for the best thread on /ck/ in a long time bros. I'll see you all in the next thread of similar ilk.

Disappearances are due to Bohemian Grove Jews lusting to sacrifize white people to their Jew God.

American forests are actual wild forests that can go on miles away from civilization. Europe is mostly just tree plantations.

Appalachian anon here. I don't know much about them yet, but I 100% believe that some kind of spirits inhabit North America and those who were here before us understood them better than we do. Tbere's always the cultural norms argument but I think there's a reason some of the world's most productive societies (as opposed to say, the Chinese) developed so many spirits which were haunted by greed. Injuns kept the spirits contained. I've been in the woods since I was a kid. I hunt and backpack solo all the time, always walking across the hills. I've seen 
>mysterious noises of metal creaking that very obviously came from a very small area, but where I couldn't find anything to cause them. I heard the noises no matter whether the wind was blowing, time of day, etc. Gives me chills and makes my eyes water to think about it. 
>rattlesnake coming out of the brush at me in PA on a forty degree, rainy morning. Some wacky shit had already gone down on this trip so I connected this to it - from what I know snakes out in open ground in weather like that are not super likely. 
>getting into my tent and seeing the space between the rainfly and tent covered in bugs, like 50-60. Assumed there was some explanation but this has never happened to me before in decades outdoors and hasn't happened since. 
>the spots where the birds don't sing
Don't be aggressive, don't look back or be afraid. You are a guest. Act like one and you have nothing to fear. Don't trash the woods. I don't ever use drugs and only drink a bit from a flask in the woods. I don't use a flashlight while hiking at night unless I have to, like looking through a bag. Some things are meant to sleep in the dark. The world isn't there to make it your own.

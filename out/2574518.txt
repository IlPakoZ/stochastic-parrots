New to hiking, my son got one stuck on his head. I used tweezers to pull it out and I cannot tell if I ripped the head off or not. 

Is this just a hunk of skin or is it the guts from its head?

you can't get any disease from ticks. it's just a jewish trick to make people leave nature and get everyone in cities.
once they test you for lyme disease or whatever disease, once they take your blood they actually inject a toxic metal into your vein that they put on a needle tip.

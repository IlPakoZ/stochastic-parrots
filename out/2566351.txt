--- 2566508
Too heavy, feel like a pleb using it while out.

I take headphones, they are good against the wind and feel cosy late at night. I don't spook easily because there are no threats in terms of UK wildlife.

Naw, drum circles are still a thing, and I like to listen to 'Expansions" by LLS while laying on my back staring into space. Listening to good music while camping is what it's about. Just keep it low enough so it can't be heard by other campers.

I forget how pathetic and autistic 90% of the anons here are.

Nothing better than getting drunk around the fire with a few good mates, toasting some sausages, drinking beers and whiskey and chatting shit whilst tunes play on the speaker. If no ones around who cares. Have sex nerds

--- 2572303

Ignore the autists ITT OP, I use an anker soundcore flare, good bass and waterproof. Perfect for those cosy nights beside the fire with bros. Pro-tip, listen to an audiobook on it whilst you lay beside the fire, some of my best memories are listening to blood meridian whilst getting shitfaced on whiskey and stargazing in the Scottish wilderness

You could at least learn to play an instrument and play music for yourself, but you aren't happy unless you get shit-faced and use electronics to ruin the experience for people who actually enjoy /out
--- 2572523
>>2566351 (OP)
Any name brand speaker that is waterproof will do. Just make sure you put on delicate steve before you pack your bowl.

Nice strawman, me and a few friends can also play instruments, but it's tiring doing that all night and speakers have great sound quality these days. There are multiple ways to enjoy /out/, and desu it sounds like me and my buddies have a much better time than you do seething over imaginary normies listening to their darned music and having too much fun. The outdoors are big, there's space for everyone, grow up and go outside

You think frontier-era cowboys wouldn't use speakers when they got shitfaced around the fire if they were available at the time? Those kinda guys would be the people you creeps seethe over being to rowdy and not 'properly enjoying nature' from behind your computer screens

Pretty sure the imagery of cowboys playing guitars and harmonicas is well-known. It'd be a more accurate larp if you actually played an instrument

--- 2572547
>>2572540
My point was that if the autists ITT were around back then they'd be equally seething about the people they presumably idolise, because it's not really the loud music they hate, it's groups of normal people capable of socialising and having fun infringing on their autistic safe space, because they have autism/social anxiety/inceldom etc.
--- 2572548
>>2572546
as a speaker user I'd love to have a friend that could play shit like that with me, best I usually get is a guitar player
--- 2572551
Seriously though, is blasting music in nature a meme or something? I've never once encountered anyone doing this. Do you all camp at designated campgrounds and hike normie-tier social trails like the AT or something?
--- 2572552

90% of /out/ never go outside, they just like to get angry about imaginary things
--- 2572562
>>2572547
Can't speak for anyone else, but I really do just hate the loud music. I go on camps with friends and we have a great time without speakers.
--- 2572566
>>2572562
People blasting music super loud is annoying sure, especially if the music is shit, but if they're in the middle of nowhere you can literally just not go near them and be fine. Also in my experience me and pals have music playing reasonably quiet so we can hear eachother talk still, don't think that's particularly egregious like people are making out ITT. They're just getting angry over strawmen
--- 2572568
>>2572566
A good rule is if you can see/hear other people, you aren't /out far enough.
--- 2572587
>>2572566
I went to an easy camping place last summer, and there was one of those "hiking and camping for blacks" groups. About 15 of them. Half of them had their shirts off, male and female. The women were just in sports bras with their fat bellies hanging out. I had to walk a mile past to get them out of earshot. They were up till 2 in the morning.

Nothing infuriates me more than a lazy trap beat.
--- 2572590
>>2572587
maybe don't camp at a shitty public campsite/trail then retard
>they were up till 2 in the morning
How do you know, you didn't bother hiking a mile away from them?
--- 2572596
>>2572252
how about I camp where I want to?
--- 2572599
>>2572590
Look I live in the midwest, there isn't much other than public campsite/trails. Retard. We don't have wilderness. We have cornfields. 
>How do you know
Because I woke up and moved camp in the middle of the night. I figured they'd be in bed by 10.
--- 2572605
>>2572599
>Look I live in the midwest, there isn't much other than public campsite/trails.
Yes there is, retard. Would take absolutely minimal effort to find far more remote locations. Retard.
>Because I woke up and moved camp in the middle of the night. 
Why?
>I figured they'd be in bed by 10.

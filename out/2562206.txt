And for what purpose is each?

I just got a 20L and a 40L at a really great price but not sure if these sizes are good.

--- 2562210
I have a 20 for warm seasons, and a 30-ish for cold seasons. As long as you're not bringing a bunch of extraneous stuff and you aren't camping the artic circle, you should be fine with the sizes you got.
--- 2562216
>>2562210
You use a 20 for camping? Wtf??
--- 2562218
>>2562206 (OP)
12L for day hikes
48L for 2-3 hikes
might get a bigger bag next year
--- 2562223
>>2562216
Yeah, but only in the spring/summer so far.
--- 2562250
>>2562206 (OP)
22L for day hikes, 48L for backpacking. I can squeeze a six day trip into it with lows in the 30’s, including rain gear. That’s with a hammock setup so it’s a little bulky. I could definitely wily go smaller for shorter trips and fair weather, but it rides fine when it’s not completely full so there’s really not much of a point.
--- 2562256
>>2562206 (OP)
45L 
75L with extra straps to attach additional stuff

Both packs compress down really small to the size of their frames basically so I don't need smaller packs when I'm packing just 30L for the weekend.
--- 2562268
I only used a serious bag in the army. Is around 90 not standard go-to for you guys?
--- 2562280
>>2562206 (OP)
50L, I use it for hiking and for traveling between my home town and the town where I study.
I just got into hiking (and /out/doors stuff in general) so I don't know if it will serve me well on longer hikes.
--- 2562412
>>2562223
How the fuck do you fit enough food clothes water and a tent in a 20L
--- 2562413
>>2562256
What??? Is this for winter or summer hiking and for how many days
--- 2562421
>>2562412
not that guy, but strap shit to the outside
--- 2562443
>>2562206 (OP)
20L and a 55L
--- 2562464
>>2562413
45L is the maximum size you need for anything touristy during hiking season, long distance trails like PCT/AT, or hut hiking, climbing and mountaineering in the Alps. carry a maximum of 25lbs. 

75L is optimal for carrying 1-3 weeks of food, subarctic tours where you need additional gear same as tours in autumn (mountain) weather, hunting out of a backpack, and basic winter tours like cross country skiing with regular resupply.
carry a maximum of 50lbs but sometimes overload up to 70lbs if I need extra food.
--- 2562469
>>2562412
I'm that guy.
>food
I don't bring much because I don't like to pig out when I'm camping. A steak for dinner, coffee and oatmeal for breakfast, that sort of shit.
>clothes
Spare boxers, spare socks.
>water
I hand-carry my canteen or hang it from my belt.
>tent
If I'm running the 20L then I strap my shelter to the outside. My tarp could fit in the 20 bag, but I mostly use that in the cold season.
--- 2562749
>>2562216
I use a Kode 22 for anything two nights or less in the summer for a hike of 40k or less. I also use it as a day-pack. I use a Kestral 48 for anything longer or when I want to take extra food and drink.
>>2562218
I like the 22L for day hikes because it isn't uncommon in spring and fall to start at 600 feet in 60 degree weather and to make it to 6,000 feet and it's 30 and snowing...in about 4 miles.
--- 2562750
>>2562464
Anything over 50 is for hunting or if you have kids and you're packing most of their shit as well. I can get almost a week out of my 48 liter in all except conditions except winter camping.
--- 2562767
>>2562750
You basically have to combine sports to validate a pack in the 70L+ range. My packraft, dry suit, PFD, and helmet are ~30L alone.
--- 2562777
>>2562767
I could see a 70liter for expeditions over a week...In like south America or Africa. I know people that will take a larger pack to the basecamp and summit with a compressible 20 liter.
--- 2562779
>>2562750
>>2562767
>anything over 50 
I like to go hiking when there are no tourists and faggy city people. If you want to avoid tourists you need more.
--- 2562854
I still don't get how the fuck y'all make a 20L pack work for a week of /out/. my medium alice pack is full after throwing a couple freeze dried meals and a fucking hardshell parka in it
--- 2562874
>>2562854
I would have the parka rolled up outside the pack but under the flap, held in place with the compression straps. Or else strapped to the loops on the bottom of the bag.
--- 2562878
>>2562854
>hardshell parka inside the bag
Well there's one problem. What else are you putting in there?
--- 2562881
>>2562874
I keep my sleeping bag on the top of my bag under the compression straps and my sleeping pad on the bottom under the compression straps. 
>>2562878
few mountain house meals taped together 
cheap ass little stove burner to use with GI canteen
lantern, headlamp
poncho and woobie
tarp stuffed into the lid pocket
2 pair of socks and an extra pair of undies
the parka
and that's pretty much where I said fuck it I'm getting a large alice pack
--- 2562903
>>2562881
I'm not sure what you mean by bottom. Are you using these mounting points under the bag for anything? If not, use them with some extra web straps.
--- 2562907
>>2562903
I use those for my USGI sleep pad
2 2qt canteens on either side
2 saw pouches on either side above those
if I want to bring a pot with me I gotta do it johnny appleseed style
--- 2562908
>>2562907
So you only have the sleeping bag up top, right? Do it like this, sleeping under the rainflap, parka over the flap but still under the straps.
--- 2562909
>>2562907
>>2562908
--- 2562911
>>2562909
well that works pretty well actually 
might give the medium another shot in the summer as a smaller pack but right now I'm enjoying how much easier it is to load shit into a large alice. easy to go overboard tho
--- 2562914
>>2562911
If you put a horizontal compression strap around the large alice you can cinch down your load better. This doesn't outright prevent you from overloading it, but it's amazing how much less you pack when you don't have "it'll fit better" as a justification. I'd take a picture but I'm using the strap for something else right now, and I already put all my shit away.
--- 2562915
>>2562914
yeah I plan on doing that, I have some 550 cord going around but it's not quite the same as an actual strap
--- 2562933
>>2562206 (OP)
I hunt, so i need more room than some faggot bringing raingear and a bad dragon dildo to go hike 300yds.

I use a 45l for day hunts

An 83L for any overnighters up to 5 days of camping.

And i have an 105L pack for 6+ days of camping or if its extremely cold and i need lots of clothes, plus winter bag, tent, spotting scope, lots of food etc etc.

For most camping excursions i use the 83L pack if i can. But sometimes the 105L pack really comes in handy. I use the same frame for all 3 bags.

> What size backpacks do you guys have/use? 
if you have to ask this question don't buy a backpack larger than 40L, YET. 
this thread
is fucking
brain dead
for the fact that nobody has said this yet:
when you're starting off the smartest thing to do is:
buy a daypack and an overnighter/weekend pack, or a lightweight weekend pack that can compress down enough to be a suitable daypack.
10-20L and a 30-40L.
then don't buy any other backpack until you have purchased all your gear for what you're planning to do.
if its a large backpack for winter backpacking or something like that, buy everything going in it first.
put all that shit into some trash bags of known volume.
put some food, water, etc in there or something of similar size.
add up how much space it takes in the trash bags.
add yourself some wiggle room if you want it.
= 
perfect sized backpack every time without having to ever ask this question, or waste money. the pack is useless without the stuff to put into it. common backpacker advice you'll get is to buy it last. 
overexplained for posterity to other newfag anons. you didn't fuck up OP, you bought the right sizes.
--- 2563043
and if you are buying a pack IRL from an outfitter its normal, not weird or autistic at all to bring all your gear with you and stuff it in the packs when trying them on. people do it all the time. some anons are too autistic to but its a sure fire way to not fuck up the fit. ultralight niggers get fucked because their packs are all made in redditor's basements.

32L for overnighters and multi day trips where I'm not packing food
68L for multi day solo trips
I usually have extra space in my 68L but it is really light and compresses a lot so its worth it to me. I can pack my huge bear canister if I need to or pack my ursack and compress it down to half the size
--- 2563914

Kestrel 68?
--- 2563941
>>2563914
Ula circuit 68l but my 32l is a kestrel 32 from some years ago. Still holding up really well. Its different than the other kestrels because its panel loading like a normal backpack and I can easily access gear at the bottom of the pack.

the 20L size was just hyperbole. seems like 50L is roughly the largest size that gets recommended here but I have trouble fitting more than a couple days of supplies into a 40L pack. I'm not trying to just sit in the dark and eat cold oatmeal when I go out

20L seems like a stretch. I guess if you’re only taking food for one night, it’s summer, not raining, and you’re sleeping in a single wall shelter or tarp.

I have done overnights out of a rei flash 18 before. The trick is using a down sleeping quilt (high compressibility) and a low volume shelter (bivy or tarp). Do not bring extra clothes besides socks and extra layers. You do not need to change clothes while camping.

Rush 24 5.11 37L
Like some anon said I wouldn’t go over 40L if you just started try to see if either backpack you have will fit with what you will be carrying.
--- 2569149
>>2562206 (OP)
Size is going to depend on how long you will be out and what you will be doing and where/when you are doing it.

For a day hike you will only need a small backpack, liters usually in the 20s range.

For a multi day hiking trip that will be a week or less, or a week or less in between resupplies you will need 40-60ish liters depending on if you need to bring winter gear. Many thru hikers (not the ultra light guys) have this size pack, because even though they are going a long way over along time they stop to resupply frequently.

If you are taking an extended trip with no resupplies, want extra room for looting, or you are hunting large animals and need to be able to pack out meat, a pack up to 80L will work fantastic. You will likely not use all the space most of the time, so find one that cinches down tight for w. Many people have obese 100L packs, those are retarded in almost any case. Even an 80L is retarded too if you don’t know why you actually need it. I have not yet met anybody who needs a 100L pack.

My personal recommendation is to get a good day pack, mid size week trip pack, and extended trip/hunting pack. Pack only what you need and nothing more, extra space does not need to be filled.
--- 2569151
>>2569149
Add on to this
If you are a super minimalist guy in a warm environment you can get away with smaller packs, you will see ultra light guys with packs that will support them for about a week with daypack size capacities
--- 2570370
>>2569149
If you haven't spent at least a season with a ~40 liter you have no business even thinking about going bigger.

>>2568757
Not all of us live in the flatland. I regularly start a hike in 60 degree weather and end up in snow. I have to bring extra clothing even for day hiking especially in spring and fall.
My day pack is a Kode 22 and has kit for rain, snow, and summer--all can occur on the same day.

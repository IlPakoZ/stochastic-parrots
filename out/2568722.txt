examples of /out/ism?

I'll start:
>using only one tree species of firewood at a time
>minmaxing portable chargers by charging your phone only up to 80% at a time
>avoiding 5g los
>maintaining one set of footprints even though you've camped through multiple snowstorms
>adjusting length of hiking poles even to the point of asymmetry to minmax specific trail sections
>paper towel around each toe
>brings a collared dress shirt because "just in case"
>knows a tempingly fallen birch tree won't get him across that stream, still tries it anyway because "it might work this time"
>has 5 different gps apps on phone, still uses google maps

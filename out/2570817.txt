I hate cellphone software developers beyond words. Meta data has been in images since 79 and none of these fucking retards can orient pictures correctly and it has been a problem for 20 fucking years. Meta data was NEVER EVER MENT TO CONTROL ANY IMAGE FEATURES.
I hate these retards so much its unreal...whoever made autoupdates normalized needs to be castrated and have their bloodline culled.

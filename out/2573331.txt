yeah, shits fucking crazy
they got cool rocks &amp; mushrooms
i saw this rock the other day ago, it has some fossils in it

where to find fossils anon? 

I'm pretty sure I have some fossilized rocks but no fossilized organisms. Pickerel is as close as I've gotten, a fossilized forest along the shore at Gerroa

you probably know as much as i do, i literally just moved to a place that has fossils about a week ago, other than that i was a shut-in for 23 years straight
i'm in north west tennessee, so i just go by the streams they got out here, its really, really, really easy here
in a single day i found all of imagerelated, the starfish was merely lying there on the ground by the water, waiting some million years to be picked up
best advice i got is put on some water shoes &amp; some shorts, go to a river, and just look around

duuuude you know what's bettter than fossles? injun artifacts and your area is so rife with them that people literally wander streams and find them by eye just strolling. check youtube because it's amazing, if you know which kinds of riverbends and wash zones to looks, the shit is fucking everywhere. these guys come home with a small bucket of 7-10k year old arrowheads and such per outting, if you get super lucky you can find shit pre or co-dating the last ice age.

I lived in New England my whole life and wasted so much youth and leisure adult time hopping rocks along the local rivers and streams in the woods and never fucking even knew to look and I'm so mad. The mid-south though, that area is PRIME artifact hunting. seriously watch some videos and how-tos, it's so worth your while.

sadly I now live in Aus an the natives here never invented things like pipes, arrowheads, axes, or fire. there are literally museums that display rocks with "some degree of certainty this stone was used to pound dirt once". boring shit.

i was in socal, barstow specifically (i'm out, so i don't care)
they had plenty of artifacts, especially from settlers, it was a pissstop through &amp; through, great for 130+ yearold rifle cases &amp; whiskey bottles
if you gone to the right areas after a good sandstorm, you could find things straight out of the mid 1800's, shit was crazy, stuff looked like it was just dropped there a few years ago
it was govt. property though (and filled with unexploded ordinance), so they got pissed if they found you snooping around

that's pretty cool as well though. and I know the feeling, I lived in the LA area a couple years and was overall happy to move on. my hometown in MA dates from about 1690 and sometimes you can find cool shit, usually kicking through fields after the farmers plowed. we have some old rusty tools and railroad spikes and such dating back maybe 150 years, and I have a 100yr old whiskey bottle I found wedged in the rocks of a stonewall in the middle of the woods. never knew I could find arrowheads and such along waterways where it erodes, that would have been cool beans.

next time you're out along the stream check the bends where it erodes and there are small rocks everywhere. you're bound to find some arrowheads if you develop a keen eye

thanks for the info, didn't know
at the stream in my area i've found probably about 30 sizeable fossils, and over 100+ small ones so far
i'm the mississippian era, so i'm finding a lot of sea fossils; while i'd love to find some precambrian fossils, like that of charnia or dickinsonia, they're not really near me at all whatsoever
you should check your area's geologic areas for anything good, its worth a try

I do live near a national park (where it's super unacceptable to fossick but I might try and get savvy about where to find the good rocks. there are definitely visible fossils in the bedrock sandstone along the river and such but that stuff is just for looking rather than swiftly pocketing.

i have a neat display of random trinkets and don't have any minerals, much less fossils, to display so this would be fun for me. some friends in MA are sending me one of the old 1860s railroad spikes we've found because that would be kind of a nice nostalgic prize to have here on the other side of the planet

as much as i hate the idea of stealing (especially for fossils), if the fossils are at a chance of eroding or otherwise being destroyed &amp; they're real quality, you should think of doing something about it
better taken &amp; stored / donated to a museum (a few years later) than let to turn to literal dust

I agree. if they were being enjoyed by all you don't even fuck around, but you find a mineralized mollusk washing toward the sewer? I mean c'mon, snatch it for minimal value or let it go for zero value forever. I think the key is being fair when you evaluate whether you should snatch something up or not. 

although â€ bh most of my foraging in the national park is for funnel web friends but that's a whole different thing :3

All the cool places are at the very least an hour away from me.

Right outside of Barstow is the Calico Man archeological dig, from which some of the oldest stone tools in the western hemisphere were found. 
In Victorville we used to say the best thing about Victorville is that it's so close to Barstow. This was deadpanned, and if the other person understood the humor, you'd know they were cool in the way only older methheads can be. Damn I miss that west coast tweaker humor.

Does /out/ go on bike tours?

I have a gravel bike that I've been using for short one day trips but I would like to do some longer tours up to two weeks. I guess there's the obvious stuff like repair kits and light camping equipment but since I'm a newbie I would like to gather some input from more experienced people.

Any tips for an aspiring gravel bike traveler? What were the less obvious things you had to learn on your trips? What things do new people forget too often?

>>2574070 (OP)
Longest proper "bike tour" I did was 3 days of biking and I covered 300km during that. Honestly, as much as I like biking (I go biking every single day when it's not raining), I just don't relish the actual biking part of the tour. It's more of a means to an end for me.

Most commonly I just do a 100km bike out to this nature reserve area and then set up camp there for however long I want. Feels way nicer than taking a car there, the bike roads to the reserve are great, and the trip isn't too daunting for friends who aren't avid bikers. 

Now, with that in mind. Here's just a few learned experiences, but since you are probably not much more experienced then me... just take them for what they are:
1) What I underestimated my first go was copious need for water, which is like... an obvious beginner mistake. You might want to get an idea of where local stores and/or gas stations are located along your bike path too so you know when you should stock up.
2) My friend made the horrible mistake of biking with a backpack. Even if it's an extra 1-2kgs it is NOT something you want to put your ass and back through.

Now some fun things I'm happy I did:
1) Brought a fitness tracker. Really nice to see the distance covered when you're out biking.
2) Brought a small speaker to strap onto my bike. Kinda nice to play some music when you're biking for so long. Maybe some purists will hate on me for not just listening to the sound of the wind but yeah.
3) Tuned my bike. Get that bike in tip-top shape. Long distances and durations will make you pay attention to minor discomforts.

Other than that, I don't know how many surprises a bike tour can throw at you. Your ass will hate you. Take rest days to combat that. I powered through my 3 days as a noob and it wasn't nice.

desu i dont understand ppl spending soo much money on carbon bikes...
Something happens to carbon ur fucked.
Now steel can be welded and thus if you do some damage it can be fixed.
Carbon is light but if you want carry loads of stuff on it, it wont work so STEEL rulz

Awesome, thanks.
I was thinking of starting out with tours over the weekend - I figure its long enough to test things out, get punished for stupid mistakes, but not too much.

100km a day sounds like a lot though. Don't get me wrong, I'm no stranger to doing trips of this caliber with my road bike but it always seems like you're just driving for the sake of it. I found that I enjoy the trips way more when I allow myself to do detours, explore weird, interesting roads, check out the sights on the way. Also for a multi day tour it's probably better to plan for flat tires, blocked roads and all the other crap life tends to throw at you.

>>2574314
I figure its the same as with most other hobbies. You can spend a fuckton on fishing equipment but all you need is a cheap rod or two to really enjoy it. You can have your Gucci hiking setup that's rated for mount everest tier conditions and still get passed by my cheap ass, wearing cut off jeans and a hobo jacket. Spending money on your hobby is a huge part of the fun for a lot of people for some reason. I guess that's the effect of living in this capitalist nightmare we created.

I bought the cheapest gravel bike I could get (was still way to expensive) and I'm quite happy with it. Sure I can't compare it to the lightest, NASA carbon stuff but really this rabbit hole of cutting 200g here and there seems stupid to me. I am quite fit and I enjoy putting effort into what I do and I definitely don't want to minimax and optimize on my leisure activities. I just want to be prepared.

I tried bikepacking bags on my bike but they ended up making it heavy and unstable, swapped out for a 35L and back waist pack and I can fit all I see, and hide a .22
--- 2574346
>>2574070 (OP)
Bikepacking on a bicycle is appealing because there are no fuel costs, but you're making up for it with higher food costs and way less distance covered. Also any slight headwind or incline will make your life miserable. I'd rather motocamp or use an e-bike desu.
--- 2574356
>>2574346
Sorry, anon but that's a weird calculation. I'm pretty sure no one goes bikepacking because of fuel costs - it's not about traveling efficiency.
Also, an ebike for bikepacking feels like a segway for hiking - I can't help but look down on people trying to make everything as easy as possible but to each their own I guess.

1) When you bike (at least in Europe), you come by multiple shops a day. So you can replenish your comestibles often, and don't need to pack lots.

2) Except from a small repair kit, take the chain lube with you. If you get caught by a heavy rain, it'll probably wash off all the lube and your bike will end up annoyingly loud.
> plan for flat tires
Puncture-proof tires really do the job. 

3) I do plan my route, but usually I don't plan exact number of days and accommodation spots. This is because whenever I discover interesting things, I just stop to see them.
So i make myself a list of options where I can sleep (including areas where I can legally use a tent).

4) Do install fenders. You can't predict whether it'll rain in a week.

5) I do on average 90 km a day, and it's a slow peace even though I stop frequently to sightsee. Keep in mind that you have a full day – say, 15 hours – to eat, sightsee and bike.

6) I often camp in the middle of nowhere two-three days in a row when I can't find accommodation, so I bought a hub dynamo USB charger to power my phone. It does not output enough power to keep the display on, but enough for GPS, recording route and offline maps (OsmAnd).

7) Conserve your energy. I know you are able to ride through sand, but if you plan to ride for a week, just get off and push the bike through heavier terrain.

>Puncture-proof tires really do the job
do you trust them 100%? Those can still get punctured and if you don't have any replacement or repair kit you're kinda fucked.

>Do install fenders
That's something that caught my eye when I was checking out videos and blogposts on bikepacking. Lots of people don't seem to use them. How do they do it? Even if you don't care for your pack on the back side, all the mud gets flung right in your face from the front wheel.

>Keep in mind that you have a full day
Yeah, maybe I underestimate how much time there is in a day. I guess it also depends on where you're traveling. (lots of stuff to see vs vast empty roads)

>I often camp in the middle of nowhere
I'll be traveling in Europe too. Do you have any experience with wild camping? It's pretty much forbidden or heavily restricted in all European countries, yet I see people doing it all the time in lots of videos.
--- 2574410
On another note, anyone with experience on portable solar panels or dynamo chargers?

Somehow I can't imagine a small solar panel generating enough output to charge a phone on an average, slightly cloudy day. On the other hand I imagine you could have a larger one folded up and only use it partially on the road but spread it fully while camping. Maybe that's all nonsense - have no experience with solar panels.

And when it comes to other options the only dynamo charger I could find with a quick search was the PedalCell one and that's just ridiculously expensive.

>>Puncture-proof tires really do the job
>do you trust them 100%?

Obviously I don't trust them 100%, and I do carry a replacement (and a tiny repair kit). But they really save you most of the time.

When I was abroad for an internship a few years ago, I got a bike that did not have any puncture protection and within three months I got flat tire more times than in the last dozen of years, even though I buy cheap tires (continental ride tour right now).

>I'll be travelling in Europe too. Do you have any experience with wild camping? It's pretty much forbidden or heavily restricted in all European countries, yet I see people doing it all the time in lots of videos.

I'm from Poland, and there are selected areas within forests where it's legal to camp. When I can't find any sane accommodation, I look up these areas. If none of these is around, I just look up some forest that is far enough from houses and camp there. (Far enough = too far for people walking dogs.)

Since I usually end up camping in the wild once it's getting dark and leave in the morning, I never had issues with it. I think that it's unlikely to meet anyone if you camp outside touristic areas and nature reserves / national parks. In the former it's easy to find accommodation, and the latter are small enough (from biker's perspective) to camp away from them.

ORLY? https://www.cyclingabout.com/list-of-hub-dynamo-power-supplies-for-usb-devices/

Some DIY people are selling these on auction portal in Poland for about €30 (e.g. https://allegro.pl/oferta/ladowarka-rowerowa-usb-md14-nowa-wzmocniona-13602967861). I got one of these and it works as advertised.

There used to be a lot of schematics such as this one: https://digitalab.org/2017/05/bicycle-usb-charger/ for /diy/ing these.
--- 2574452
>>2574445
(contd)
Plus, with a few keywords for google, some German guy posted a more reliable schematic: https://www.instructables.com/10-BICYCLE-USB-CHARGER/
(and he seems to sell those for €30 as well: https://www.vulcaman.de/?post_type=product)

There must be more of these out there...
Check /diy/ people in your country.

It's like ultralight autism but for bikers. Carbon frames are lighter and durability usually isnt an issue since the most vulnerable components like derailleur or brakes are still metal. It probably makes travelling long distances a bit easier especially if you're doing stuff that leans more on the /xs/ side on the way. I wouldn't drop a few thousand on a frame for that though when aluminum exists.

Are there any resources you use for planning a route? I wanna try going outside of the city, but all the routes google gives me are spending days going on highways, and that doesn't sound very safe.

>I wanna try going outside of the city, but all the routes google gives me are spending days going on highways, and that doesn't sound very safe.

Toggle it to routing for bikes. Helps a lot.

>Are there any resources you use for planning a route?

First, I make a 'research' by looking at maps &amp; googling for interesting places to stop. Regard:
1) opencyclemap.org (and openstreetmap.org)
2) mapy.cz are nice online maps for many countries in Europe (you don't need an account, cancel creating it; then you need to select the touristic map)
3) look up maps of tourist attractions / interesting places; these are often biased, but still you might find nice things (e.g., for Poland there is http://mapa.polskaniezwykla.pl/)
4) some countries run official maps for tourists (e.g., for Switzerland there is https://map.wanderland.ch/)
5) check the 'commercial' routes that get advertised to attract people (e.g., the eurovelo.com, greenvelo.pl/, caminoways.com/cycling-the-camino-routes)
6) look up maps of campings, hostels/b&amp;bs etc. to plan where to sleep if you need this

Then, I use QMapShack to prepare a gpx track. It's really cool software, but takes a while to set up. Then you can route tracks easily and switch among multiple online maps. I often don't follow the track strictly, but it helps a lot to have a rough plan where to go.

just got back from one, was meant to be about 300km but only covered half due to a wheel failure my repair kit couldn't fix. 

New Zealand roads littered with glass so should have seen it coming.

I'm a noob like you, but here's my ride. Obviously not the kind of bike you'd want to tour with but it gets the job done and I enjoy it :)
--- 2575213
>>2575136
I'm bit of a perfectionist and tend to lose myself in preparation and overthinking. for example I just ordered a solar panel to try and charge my phone on the road. (kinda dumb but I want to see how it works) 

Maybe I should just pack my shit and enjoy myself more like you do. Your bike looks comfy
--- 2575214
>>2575023
what kind of hole is unfixable with a repair kit? are New Zealand roads littered with knives?
--- 2575218
>>2574445
Thanks for the pointers. I admit, I was a bit lazy with my search. I decided against a dynamo for now. want to try things out with a large battery pack and a solar panel. Should be enough when I skip into a town once in a while.

btw, not to feed any clichés or such but I'm originally from poland too so I know, at least to a degree, how things can be there in some places.
How do you manage your security? 
Do you secure your bike/camping equipment on camping grounds? Do you ever leave your shit unattended when solo traveling?
--- 2575255
Are gravel bikes better for multiday trips on poor roads and tracks? I'm thinking of doing the Kintyre way and Arran
--- 2575257
>>2575218
>How do you manage your security?
Never had problem with this. It's safe to sleep in dedicated places (camping sites, hostels etc.), for owners just call the police if anyone gets too drunk and starts causing problems. And when I pitch my tent in the middle of nowhere, my biggest concern is not to get trampled by a scared off dear.

>Do you secure your bike/camping equipment on camping grounds?
I do secure my bike, just like I do when I commute.
When I arrive early on camping site, I sometimes leave my tent with clothing, food etc. unattended, but I take those few items worth stealing (such as my camera) with me. I always take for this purpose a lightweight drawstring bag. It takes almost no space and can be used as a small backpack (I use it also to carry food I bought in the last shop before stopping for the night).

>Do you ever leave your shit unattended when solo traveling?
My biggest concern is when I visit popular touristic attractions such as museums, mansions, etc. The traffic is too big there to leave things unattended. Unless I can leave my panniers behind the desk (which usually is not a big deal), I skip the attraction.
When I shop in some random village, I even leave my phone on the handlebar. It's much more likely that local kids will do some stupid joke than that someone steals from you there.

better than what?
when it comes to longer trips I feel like you have tree options. road, gravel or trekking.

I've been using my roadbike up here in northern germany where you have pretty much ideal conditions for it. Super fast, I enjoy the burn and exhaustion but got tired of just riding for the sake of riding.

Now that I have a gravel bike I'm having way more fun. I can explore forest and gravel roads and it's just slightly more comfortable without losing too much speed on paved roads. Pretty much ideal for me.

I did do a bikepacking trip along the french coast when I was younger. two weeks with your run off the mill trekking bike - slow pace since we're traveling with a couple of girls. Super fun memories but I wouldn't do it alone. Just bit to tanky and slow feeling for my taste.

If you want to get around quickly and can expect decent, paved roads -> road bike

If you want chill traveling, getting the free spirited hobo life, riding in sandals and a hat -> 
 trekking bike

If you are more like me, like to travel fast but still enjoy the ability to explore some more difficult roads or take cool shortcuts -> gravel bike

anyone can recommend a cheap bike that would be good to use in urban and wild envirment (country side)? havent gone biking since my teens, i used to live near the mountains/forest and i would go out in the morning after breakfast and just ride wherever, sometimes i found some hills and tried riding down and shit then come back for supper, i want to start doing that again.
--- 2575949
>>2575863
define "cheap". I find that the best option financially is to check out your local used market. But you need to be aware of what you want and know what you're buying to not get screwed over because some people are just asking for retarded amounts.
--- 2575963
Only semi related, but I just got a new gravel bike for a tour and it's my first bike with tubeless. How much are are you expected to lose in a tubeless tire over time? Seems like I lose a pound a day, I have to re-fill weekly.
--- 2576014
This seems like a good thread to ask, what's a recommended first bike brand or style for an adult? I know virtually nothing about bikes since my parents were retarded and didn't teach their kids to ride. Just looking for something to learn on and peddle around town.
--- 2576016
>>2576014
you don't really go by brands with bikes. just get some comfortable citybike used.
--- 2576018
>>2576016
Anything specific to look out for? Or just anything labeled a city bike?
I'm in America and from what I understand we label low-bar bikes as womens' bikes pretty much arbitrarily, is there any reason to actually get a high bar bike?
--- 2576024
>>2576018
You don't have to get a city bike necessarily. It just has the most comfortable seating position and usually tends to be a bit cheaper. That's here in Europe though, where everyone has a bike. Just go to a shop and try out different types. get something you'll feel comfortable on if you just wanna drive around town.

when you buy one used, make sure it feel easy and robust to drive and that it doesn't make any weird noises. test the brakes, some people are driving around with them being pretty loose. If the bike has gears, check if the switching is smooth. It's kinda like buying a car. you should check some basics stuff always but usually you can tell immediately how the owner has been treating it.

When it comes to low bar frames. From what I know, traditionally they're for women since the low frame allows you to get on the bike without raising a leg (in case your wearing a skirt). Other than that, doesn't matter. Just know that people will recognize it as a women's bike.

went on a small bike trip with friends a few days ago. 
1. No backpack! it'll fuck you up in various kind of ways (hydration bladder/camelbak could be right)
2. Packs on the bike should be with the weight being at the lowest possible point.
3. two bottle holders are better than one.
4. Spare parts, tool, pump, duct tape obv.
5. Have some ready snacks (protein/energie bars), pack magnesium/mineral tablets to help against cramps
6. A compass really can help sometimes.

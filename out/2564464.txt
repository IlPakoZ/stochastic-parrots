I'm fine paying fee's but it's a bullshit complicated process here. Reserve the exact backpacking spot, parking pass, campfire permit...

And there actually are rangers that stop and check people, they've all been cool with me and only checked once before

If you make any reservations or purchase a permit through rec.gov, you are paying Booz Allen to control you. Who is Booze Allen?

Depends where you camp.. East coast campsites are ass expensive for a "spot" dunno if its to keep the niggers out because they have to pay.. but it's getting insane. tent only spot, nothing else- $30 is becoming the norm..... midwest it's still pretty cheap- for now... Then you have Bro-tier states like Nebraska that legit have firerings at their rest stops.... and have Bro-tier laws in place that protect you from using the rest stops to actually sleep- because its dangerous as fuck to drive tired but retarded ass states like my home state of florida... has too many people and basically ban you from doing this... TN before the new no camping on states lands. "anti homeless law" it was like 4 hours you could park at the rest stops.

Make it illegal to hunt and gather
Make it illegal to live outside a city
Make it illegal to pay with physical currency
Make it illegal to own a gas vehicle

Sit inside and consume digital goods, faggots.

Cartop tents are a meme. Incredibly expensive, hard to replace parts, require an expensive rack/bed rack, reduces gas mileage (and on a tacoma? lol) etc. I work in an outdoor store and they're always getting returned because they require more than one person to mount/dismount and are just a pain in the ass all around. 

I overland in my stock tacoma with my 2 person tent and a comfy sleeping pad. I have Ko2s for rocks/mud. Only thing I'm considering is a winch, but I've never gotten stuck because I know how to drive in the mud.

the only acceptable form of a cartop tent is when they are built into a van or a truck and allow access to it from inside. sleeping on top of your car sounds extremely annoying climbing up and down, just to save a few minutes of searching for a spot.
--- 2565862

The only cartop tents users are people who are afraid that snakes will somehow get into a regular tent and eat them. This fact is directly from the mouth of a cartop tent maker who I've known for 20 years.

It wouldn’t be a state law or regulation as you’d be in a national park, pretty much the only place that requires a permit. How do newfags not know that?
--- 2565963
>>2564517
As another Anon said in a different thread, the US has permit systems (almost entirely limited to national parks) because we still have natural areas that are worth preserving. They saw where Europe went wrong and took a different course.

Just because you put “lol” at the end of a question doesn’t make it a joke. Please explain the humor behind it.

funny that the parts of europe worth saving has done the exact oposite and made it a constitutional right to travel and camp freely on non developed land.

NPS/BLM is also a method for controlling the population corridors and resources. It's not as altruistic as you might think.

This is something that really pissed me off about Alberta. They recently made all crown land west of Calgary subject to a camping pass now, $60/year. Crown land is supposed to be free for everyone, and it is in the rest of the country.

Ordinary citizens will.
Law enforcement will not.
They will arrest you and impound your vehicle.
--- 2567359
Laws and regulations like that are put in place as a preventative cost
Regulates and deters morans from turning outdoors into a bigger shit show
Sucks for people who respect being out but without them tourists would be pitching tents on top of endangered species nests

What can they do to you, really? Keep you in a cell for the rest of your life because they found you sleeping under a tree and you won't tell them your name? Not bloody likely.

Because everybody knows that criminals follow laws, retard.
I don´t get people like you. It´s unironically morons like you that got us all the government tyranny, and spying.
If you make laws for retards and criminals, you end up with a country run by retards and criminals.

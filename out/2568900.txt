Tips to prevent blisters while hiking? I have been trying to take longer day hikes to prep for backpacking later this summer, like 7-9 miles in a day on some hilly terrain kind of hikes, and noticed hot spots developing on the balls of my feet that I'm sure would turn into blisters if I were hiking for days in a row.

I'm wearing cheap but adequate hiking boots and Walmart wool blend socks. Would some kind of sock liners help? Should I switch to trail running shoes for better ventilation? (my boots are waterproof and after a long day of hiking they get pretty sweaty and wet inside)

I love my sak but it’s my grandpa’s and I don’t want to lose it, and I love my mora but I want something smaller and folding and preferably with a few tools. Looking for something that will last at least through the summer without breaking, but cheap enough that it won’t be so bad if I lose it.

I mean, I'm willing to pay for quality, I already have a MSR stove but as much as I appreciate the suggestion, both of these look huge/heavy.

I was thinking about getting something smaller like a straw or a squeeze bag. I'm not really going anywhere with really dirty water but I also don't want to get diarrhea because goats pissed in a mountain stream.

I'm thinking about getting a tent and equipment for overnighting on my hikes. What's the absolute essential equipment I would need for this? I assume a tent, a sleeping bag, a decent bag to carry it all, a lamp for the evening, some way to get fire and some cooking gear. What else is necessary?

sup bros. trying to figure out how campers/hikers manage to carry all their shit for overnighters without being burdened by the weight and bulk?
so i did one solo camp and once with a friend, only sleeping out one night for both. i felt overwhelmed desu. i had a cheap 2man tent which i bought years ago for a music festival. sleeping pad which folds and is reflective. sleeping bag with liner. one of those fake helinox chairs and a little folding table. those are the bulkiest and heaviest things i had (excluding the 3l bladder). ofc i could get rid of the table and chair, that's fine. but the tent + pad + bag + liner + food + water + spare clothes + lantern + cooking gear + first aid kit.... fuck idk it felt lik a lot of shit. i managed to use my 35l pack, stuff it full, then strap the pad, bag and tent on the outside. if i had to hike anymore than an hour i would have cried. i was also cold af when i slept. i used to love camping as a kid in scouts and the vibe of nature and being out with friends is neat, but, i feel like a little bitch with all my complaints.
how can i make it easier and/or how do i toughen up? i'm determined to try again.
--- 2571448
>>2571430
>Toughen up
Commit, go do it. That's it. There's no trick. The only way to do it is to do it. Maybe read some Seneca. 
>Do it better
So, there is the problem that cheap gear is shitty for its weight and often heavy too. So, to address it, you may have to pay. 
The tent is probably a big weight. You might want to experiment with lighter shelter, like a bivvy, if local conditions allow. Also sleep systems. 
Make a list of everything you had on the last trip, and be brutal about what you didn't use or could live without. Cut back based on the list. Don't cut the first aid kit, or anything else life saving.

>>2571448
thanks for the reply, anon.
there was definitely stuff i didn't use or could live without. i will make some changes for next time!
yeah my tent is a bitch. it actually works just fine and setting up is easy, but it weighs something like 3.5kg/8lbs and is almost as big as my pack.
with a bivvy is a tarp usually expected to go with it? i get cold easily so blocking wind/rain would be better kek
when you say sleep systems what does that mean exactly?
--- 2571459
>>2571452
Bivouacs usually are a tarp essentially. But if you're a cold-sensitive type or live in a cold climate it may be suitable. 
Sleep systems are what you sleep in. I live in warm enough conditions that a cheap blanket is fine if I'm off the ground. You may need a sleeping bag or something else. This depends on your locale, budget, season, and a million other factors. Expensive means lighter (or warmer per gram).

I want to turn my shed into a mancave. It's a 10x12 shed with electrical already installed. I want to outsource putting up the insulation, drywall and vinyl/tile flooring. Pic is almost exactly what it looks like rn. Coworker's husband works construction and offered $1000 USD to do the job for "quality". I just want bare minimum, and they dropped it to $500. They haven't seen it in person yet, and don't have any of their own tools to do the job so would be using mine, and don't have a truck so I'll have to pay for all materials shipped to my house. I want to pay around $200-300 for the project, since I'm paying for all the materials/not asking for a paint job, trim, electrical, etc. Am I being stingy? I got two more guys coming over to give an estimate but I'd rather give the job to coworker's husband if reasonably priced. If i'm severely underestimating the value of the job I'm just gonna do it myself. Thoughts?

I've had a thermarest inflatable pad for 20 years (it still works fine) and two years ago got a Nemo. The Nemo is better in every way--lighter, more compressible, thicker when inflated, easier to inflate, better insulated, more comfortable.
If the Nemo makes it 20 years than it's well worth the $200. Hell, it's worth it if it makes it even half that.

I'm a poorfag but interested in outdoor footwear. I've worn trail runners for most of my hikes and am interested in branching out. The question:

What are the relative advantages, disadvantages, and uses cases of various different kinds of outdoor footwear? Especially interested in hiking boots and barefoot shoes, but I don't know what the purpose would be of switching to either from my current set of trail runners.
--- 2575391

What problem with your current footwear are you trying to solve? Foot pain? Blisters? Support to prevent twisting your ankle?

Barefoot shoes if you're a paleo fetish autist and want to re-train your feet to hike without modern arch support like our ancestors did. A lot of people love it and it gives great grip to use toeholds in rocks, but obviously less protection.

Hiking boots if you need either more warmth and protection from the elements, or more ankle support for carrying a heavy pack all day and reducing risk of rolling your ankle. But cheap hiking boots are not much better than trail runners.

Honestly trail runners are usually your best bet if you're on a budget. I wouldn't invest in other footwear unless you have one of the above reasons to make a change
--- 2575422

First of all, that's retarded and I don't know why you want to do that. But if you're hell bent on doing it, but still paranoid about falling out, I would get some arborist's climbing spikes and a safety harness. Climb up one tree and attach one end of the hammock. Maybe toss a pull line from the other end of that hammock into the branches of the other tree to help you get a hold of it to fasten the other end. Then, climb up the other tree, attach the other end, and also tie up a rope to your safety harness to catch you if you fall. (to a SEPARATE BRANCH--so if whatever is supporting your hammock gives out your harness is still safe). Sleep with the harness on.

Like seriously just don't do this, your idea is dumb, but if you insist that's how I would do it.

If you need a lot of power EcoFlow are made for camping, but not waterproof. If you keep it in a tent it should be fine and it has a 3 second timer on the start button. If you just want a little battery to charge your phone Caterpiller used to make a rugged one that was fairly waterproof to go with their rugged phones.

Why tyvek? You can buy a roll of plastic sheeting for $15, 4 mil 10x25. If you want it thicker just double it up. Home Depot Husky Plastic Sheeting Clear 4ml 10ft x 25ft.

The issue is the movement higher up a tree in wind will be pretty significant. Even if you aren't slingshot out, it won't be a pleasant night.

Don't they make setups like platforms and tents for cliff climbing? You'd still have to deal with wind, but it'd be less like someone plucking a guitar string. Maybe find one and hang it from the tree instead of a cliff?

Well that's dumb. That's not what it's designed for. It's a weave and likely to get soak thru eventually.

Anything from the home wrap product line has a hydrostatic head of 1300 or greater, which is on par for many nylon floors. Especially as a tent or bivy ground sheet where it's below a second material that's fine. Also pretty tough vs polyco or lightweight nylons.

they're made with really thick canvas and do a great job keeping out the rain and cold without being waxed, so only thing to think about is how much you care about the added weight and larp factor of waxed canvas. ngl it's kino af

The only legit reason I have to change is that I seem to have an ankle-rolling incident about every other time I get on the trail. I've never actually hurt myself while doing so thanks to quick reflexes, but I think it's just a matter of time. 

That said, I am also a crypto hippie autist and like the idea of minimalist shoes (and minimal clothing in general) while outdoors, and barefoot shoes appeal to me for that reason. I've also been getting more into climbing recently, so the toehold thing isn't a triviality either. That's why I'm torn

I have a waxed cotton jacket and a waxed Hemp hat. The jacket is extremely light and works great and the hat is Gucci. I do use a Pancho in torrential down poors because the wax is water resistant not water proof. You also have to re wax it every few years bit that's easy.

Sounds like we're pretty much in the same boat actually. Though I have been good so far on ankle issues.

You should focus on good hiking boots first, that is by far your more pressing problem. I can't recommend you specific brands as I also am a poor, other than don't buy Keen. I have done most of my hiking in either trail runners or really low end hiking boots (think Ozark Trail and Nevados, absolute Walmart tier shit). And those usually do fine initially, but they fall apart in a few months if you use them heavily. I can tell you you should stay away from cheap fully-waterproof hiking boots, your feet will swim in sweat and get blisters. Either get boots that can breathe, or get higher end waterproof boots with Goretex.

I also have the kind of autism that makes me want to get into minimalist/barefoot hiking. I haven't bought the minimalist hiking shoes yet, and it sounds like you shouldn't either, save your shekels for good hiking boots instead. But to get a similar experience and see if I like it, I recently hiked a few miles with a pack on in some $8 wader shoes. I definitely felt more in touch with the ground under my feet and enjoyed how I could take advantage of my foot's flexibility to grab onto rocks or balance on logs. It works some muscles in your foot and ankle you're not used to if you have used modern shoes your whole life, but I expected that. I probably will get the barefoot shoes at some point in the future

Cotton poly blend. You get a mixed bag.

Cotton holds a shit ton of water, gets abrasive when wet, and loses its form (sagging, sticking, and generally being a nuisance). But it’s supremely breathable and doesn’t smell like dog shit after a day.

Polyester feels like you’re wearing a god damn trash bag because it can’t breathe, and gets fish dumpster stinky pretty quickly. But it’s super soft, doesn’t absorb water, and holds its form.

A blend will be middle ground; somewhat breathable, and only holding some water. They seem to hold their shape just as well as full polyester, but stink just as quickly too. Tbdesu stinking isn’t that big of a deal (who cares, really?). 

Tank top > t-shirt (ventilation) but pack straps are usually pretty rough. I had some Velcro sleeves that I put around my pack straps because of that. 

Unfortunately no one is making cotton-poly technical clothing so you have to experiment and figure it out for yourself. And unlike wool there are no specs on the fabric, so they’re not all the same (some will be thicker than others).

I'm looking to eradicate some feral pigs on my dad's 40 acres. I see clear signs of where they have been digging up the tracks around the property. I have some 180 grain .30-06 (I know it's overkill, but I won't be eating them because they're diseased and plus I want the most ethical kill possible) and I'm thinking of posting up (like camping with a tarp) near a dam. Does anyone have any tips on how I can find them when their active or how to shoot/attract them?

Drywall ain't cheap or it ain't straight. Cheapest is to do it yourself and use plywood. Leave it unpainted. Even then $200-300 is going to be low.

Cooking oil is a meme. It doesn't really work, I tried to figure it out for a year. It's too viscus to wick and burns the wick as you've found. I've tried thinning the oil with alcohol and other lamp oil, and still didn't get it to work.

The only way I've had it work is with these little metal wick holders that rest at the bottom of a mason jar. The flame is close enough that it heats the oil allowing it to flow.

Honestly tho kerosene in bulk is cheap. Go to a farmer coop or local farm supply store and ask where to get it. your set up will still smoke tho. Smoke with standard kerosene is because there's no chimney. 

There was a guy who basically used stubby mason jars and a modified oil lamp top that brought the flame really close to the oil as well, but I haven't tried it yet.

You can probably sleep drunk in the cab with no keys in reach. They can't argue intent to drive if the keys aren't on you. I've done this successfully in wisconsin, but it was years ago. Just don't tell them they are in the gas cap or under the hood. Ask a local lawyer to confirm.

And how did you react the first time you caught a fish or made it to the top of your first big climb? If you weren't excited, maybe you should add psychopath to your adhd and autism self diagnosis you emotionless fuck. Learn to enjoy someone elses excitement vicariously and maybe it will renew yours.

It's so fucking cruel, there's this boomer on YouTube who does shit like shooting pigs with 22LR or dropping a spear onto them (the fat lazy cunt can't throw it but he drops it from a tree stand and misses all the vital areas). I genuinely wish to eradicate feral pigs everywhere but not like that, they didn't choose to be invasive, the least I can do is give them a quick death.
--- 2576276
>>2576222
i managed to get it pretty good by adding a collar over the wick which keeps it tight. the wick still burns up but a lot slower and there's far less smoke. the reason i didn't want to use kerosene is cause i wanted to learn how to haw a decent light/heat source in a pinch. most homes have cooking oil, cotton string and a jar, but not all of them would have kerosene. but yeah you're absolutely right, canola oil is not fit for purpose.

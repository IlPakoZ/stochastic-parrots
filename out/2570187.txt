What are the best brushes for miniatures?

How much would you pay? GW brushes are expensive. Then thereâ€™s also synthetic brushes vs natural hair. What should I get?

Just go to a hobby shop and buy a selection

Don't get miniature specific stuff, its overpriced and identical to the regular stuff

GW brushes are expensive trash; skip 'em. Da Vinci #1 round red sable as your workhorse, #0 round red sable for detailing. You're out maybe $40-$45 between the 2; seems like a lot, but worth it; they last forever if you keep them clean. Cheapo synthetics for drybrushing &amp; mixing.

This is a super important skill to learn for new painters. Never let the paint get up into the base of the brush, it will harden and push the bristles out of shape.

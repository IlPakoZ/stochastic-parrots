Seems like you should’ve explored before buying it

Rent a dozer for a week and use it to move the junk into one spot, then build a fort with it
--- 2576579
>>2576577
thats the plan one day, but its 44 acres so its quite easy to escape the junk if you want to

Nice little creek you got on your land. Wonder if it has any brook trout in it. What kind of wildlife have you seen so far. Set up any game cams? That could be interesting
--- 2576588
>>2576548 (OP)
this is kind of neat. nice Slender vibes at night no doubt
--- 2576589
>>2576586
thanks! ive found 4-5 different creeks so far, theres a nice sized pond on the land too. too small for fish i think but i could be wrong. i set a trail cam every week or so, ive seen white tail deer, black bear, partridge, woodcocks, porcupines, rabbit, pheasants ect

its quite the place, pretty spooky at night, theres an old collapsed late 1800s/ early 1900s house aswell thats pretty unsettling at night time
--- 2576594
one of the 5 busses
--- 2576596
the house at the front of the land, still some things inside but too dangerous to enter, collapses more and more each day
--- 2576606
>>2576589
You should try fishing some flies in some of those deeper pools, see what kind of species are in there. I fish for trout in creeks that size all the time. Are you planning on doing any habitat restoration on your land? Maybe you could clear out some of that junk or remove some invasive plants and sow some native plant seeds. You could really attract a lot of wildlife with all of those water sources

dang man I wanna see this

I stumbled upon pickerel totally unexpected one day while walking through the uncharted "coyote territory" just south of the nearly impassable cedar meadow (i.e. the witch's woods). startled the fug outta me
--- 2576613
>>2576606
ill give it a shot next time i trek that way again! i definitely will, theres a guy a few kms down the road that might help me clear alot of it and sell it for scrap. this summer i will introduce some lily pads and other aquatic plants to the pond, i would also like to dam the pond and make it a bit larger
--- 2576618
>>2576610
if you ever find yourself in eastern canada come on down buddy. "witches woods" sounds interesting, thats a beautiful ford, you found that?
--- 2576628
>>2576618
Yeah it was just abandoned and the logging road it clearly drove in on is now overgrown so it's well and truly stuck in there.

And yeah there's a maybe 100 acre section of the woods that's old cedar forest, the one spot the colonists never cleared back in the 16-1700s. there are still stonewalls running through the woods and the cedar meadow begins abruptly behind three of the walls, that was as far as they cleared. its super dark and hard to walk through because the trees are so thick with spiny low branches, you can't really see far and you also can't get away quickly without stabbing and scratching the hell out yourself, so you feel very vulnerable. lots of signs of bears and every night the coyotes howl from here so you just never know if you're being stalked or if you've gone too far to have a safe escape. And it's eerie as fuck anyway, I get neither the heebies nor the geebies except in that area. 

I don't have a great photo but this action cam frame from my mountain bike shows the edge of the cedar forest off to the left. this is a snowmobile trail that skirts through that side of town

I'd say a lot of your property (from what I've seen so far) needs some tender loving with a skid-steer mounting one of those forestry mulcher attachements. Except for all the bits of random metal lurking about, that'd make it a bit of a minefield. 

Still looks like it has a ton of potential. Best of luck, bud.

I think you got two of us mixed up a bit, I'm not opie

>take away roof to lower weight and risk of house collapses
>explore what it has inside
Or
>demolish it and avoid any risk
--- 2576693
>>2576687
If I was OP I would prop it up as to maintain the character of the collapsing old structure and also not make all those ghosts homeless

thats a shame, have people stripped all the parts? that sounds like a fun forest to explore, we dont have many cedar forest out this way, plenty of awful tangled alder forests though. i love old growth forests, spooky or not.
--- 2576732
>>2576677
yea absolutely, its been neglected and used as a dump for many years but thats part of its character. one day ill be able to afford a tractor or bobcat do do some real work
--- 2576733
>>2576687
i might knock it over myself to see if theres any salvageable wood left inside. the area the land is in only has a few hundred residents if that, and the house is well hidden so i dont have to worry about people trying to explore and getting killed on my property thankfully
--- 2576734
>>2576697
spoogy.

we found some old film negatives of people inside that house and developed them, theyre interesting to say the least
--- 2576735
>>2576693
i think i will leave it alone for now, the ghosts should be maintaining it themselves thats not my problem
--- 2576736
>>2576731
not stripped at all actually. it's not on any trails and it's deep on private property away from roads and such. aside from a couple bullet holes and a piles of c.1990s beer cans in the dirt behind it, I think it's probably forgotten. I found it on google maps when I switched to one of the years they took the photos during winter. You can't see dick in the summer photos

It's the best forest, it has fucking everything I love from old colonial history, indian wars, abandoned farmland, creeks, ravines, a lake, coyotes and bears, etc.

I hope to someday own a chunk of land much like your own, with or without the relics
--- 2576739
>>2576736
nice! thats pretty suprising, youd think someone would stumble upon it and strip engine or body parts. thats an impressive find, we've found some cool shit with google maps aswell. right on man, is land still affordable where you are? (im assuming youre in the states)
--- 2576742
>>2576739
Yeah I'm in MA. the forest is about 2k acres (and much more beyond, but outside the 2k you have to cross roads). my dad bought 40 acres AND built a house all for $30k 40 years ago. Now it's going for like $20k an acre. luckily for my whole life the whole forest has remained undeveloped.

Might retire to somewhere remote in Canada someday, my family is from Quebec maybe I'll get some brownie points. I live in Aus now though and I have my eye one some rural mountain areas in the Southern Tablelands I might plonk down on someday

You dun good anon, cherish your property and maybe over time clean it up if you like, or not
--- 2576749
>>2576742
right on, pretty close to me im in NS. its insane what you used to be able to do with a few bucks. i got my land for 1000cad/acre, not bad. glad they havent torn the forest down yet. quebec has some nice wilderness areas but everyone in quebec sucks.(maybe not including your family). how hard was it to get into australia? thanks anon im slowly trying to clean it up.

from what I understand Nova Scotia is a completely different ballgame than Kebek, although it's a bigass province with surely lots of wilderness. you got an awesome price, I would KILL to pay only a thousand dollarydoos an acre, even in the middle of nowhere with no electricity or developed roads Aus is fuckin way more expensive it's shit.

Migrating to Australia is so hard it's literally become my life's work. I first moved here 18 years ago and am now finally FINALLY F-I-N-A-L-L-Y getting my permanent residency. I've had so many setbacks and rollercoasters, I've had to move Back Home™ several times over the years and return again with nothing and start over again, etc etc etc. It's made for a wonderful life though, making the best of a bad situation and being able to hunker down and camp in my childhood woods as an adult, literally in a mindset where I had nothing to lose, and then fight like hell again and regain my prosperity again back in Aus, and repeat. I wouldn't recommend it but the last time I lived in MA ended up being one of the most cherished episodes of my life, even though my family and friends basically saw me as a washup an nearly homeless. I lived in and loved the fuck out of my childhood woods, and it's all okay because now I'm back on my feet :]

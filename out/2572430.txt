>spend thousands on arcteryx and patagonia gear exclusively to start hiking
>too anxious and autistic to go go up a trail and start walking

How the fuck do I stop being so scared to go out? I even bought a garmin inreach 2 and bought rescue insurance and all that stuff in case I get lost but I'm so anxious, I'm so scared, I just want to go out of my room and be happy for once in my fucking life.

Just don't go off the trail, genius

Hike smaller, local trails or go to parks. Try to find popular trails, you'll always be around people. Consider an online hiking group or convincing a friend to try an easy hike with you so you are less nervous about being abandoned. Every time you go out, use your GPS on your phone; you'll realize quickly how hard it is to get lost if you have a charge. You'll be fine most likely; being nervous about getting lost is a good survival instinct, but you are too nervous for your own good. The people who get lost and die have NO idea what they're doing and (crucially) are way overconfident.

I know, it's just so hard, I suffer from severe anxiety and I'm terrified of doing things alone.

What the fuck do you want us to do? Go cry on reddit if you want encouragement, bitch.

Everyone will be too busy taking selfies and looking at their phones to notice you. You have nothing to be anxious about.

>>2572460
Download some podcasts or something to listen to in one ear while you hike so you have a friend simulator distracting you from being alone.

It's obvious that if seeing advice from someone named "Anonymous" was enough to convince you to go out, this thread wouldn't exist.
Find others to go with you, don't make friends just meet people, wherever you can.

This is the pattern of modernity. Confusion between the internet and real life. Subreddits acting as mental shorthand in one's own mind for the activity itself. Fields reduced to (hobbies | technicians | white-collar theorists), and the hobbies then reduced to subreddits.
If I mention something, you probably think of how to engage with it via the internet. If I say let's go hiking/shopping/socializing/escaping/preparing/investing/job hunting/dating/radical/vandalizing/eating, your mind immediately takes the well trodden path towards referring to a device to do so. I'm even doing it right now; I can barely conceive of "routes to action" that don't involve the internet as a node.
If the internet were a benign unbiased force this would be one thing, but we all know the reality.
OP probably considers himself "a hiker", "avid" even. And yet he hasn't been on a trail. But to the average person, OP isn't even that wrong. He is a "hiker", in the modern sense.
Each hobby, reduced to its reddit essence. Each hobbyist, adherent to the reddit essence. The thing itself, gone. The intangible (but obviously vivid and obviously fecund) implicitly social experience of the original thing itself - a distant memory to a fraction of a fraction of the "hobbyists".

and with each silo of life on earth reduced to this state, everyone neatly (online | in a car | in a room alone | in anonymous public anomie), men stop meeting women, employers stop meeting employees, friends stop meeting friends - except, of course, through the corresponding carefully tended online avenues. we've been domesticated. and when we find the way out, we mindlessly just stumble back online - back into the maw.

Today is Thursday or Friday for you, right? Take 30 minutes to plan out where you're going on the weekend and send the route to your parents or a friend, then stop worrying and watch anime for the next 24 to 48 hours. You'll stop feeling anxious once you go do it and realise it's less dangerous to walk 10km in the bush than cross a road in the city.

I will go for walks with frens to illegally pick mushrooms and there's nothing you can do to stop or demoralise us. OP will use his meme patagonia sticks to go on a comfy walk and you won't stop him either.

don't go alone then
take a stuffed animal with you and make an instagram profile for it 
it'll have more followers than any of us ever will lol

I used to be like this. 
Don't hike. Leave all your gear at home save for phone and water. trust. me. Every pound is just another pound of anxiety.

Just walk. 90% of trails are sidewalks but prettier. You don't even have to far. Just a quick little stroll, and back. Or, try a park. Forests are really just larger parks.

No animal larger than a dog is really active during a day, and anything else never hangs around trails.

Lain predicted this. Humans will just become nodes to a greater neural network, sending and receiving signals between each other. Humanity becomes a brain

This is the pattern of modernity. Confusion between literature and real life. Books acting as mental shorthand in one's own mind for the activity itself. Fields reduced to (hobbies | technicians | white-collar theorists), and the hobbies then reduced to magazines.
If I mention something, you probably think of how to engage with it via reading. If I say let's go hiking/shopping/socializing/escaping/preparing/investing/job hunting/dating/radical/vandalizing/eating, your mind immediately takes the well trodden path towards referring to a manual or guidebook to do so. I'm even doing it right now; I can barely conceive of "routes to action" that don't involve books as a node.

See what I'm getting at?
The first step many have taken to action is referring to documented cases of others having done that action successfully. Whether this process of study is done on books or on the internet doesn't necessarily matter.
This condensation of "hobbies" is not the internet's fault. It's the pursuit of vanity.

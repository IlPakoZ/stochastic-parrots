I'm so glad my dad kept that boat after his dad passed. Hoping it'll take three generations of our family fishing together once again this summer.

the beautiful river trout. Easily the prettiest and best tasting fish where I live. They also inhabit pretty places only, which makes catching them a pleasure.

Hello fellow Sierra Chad.

First thing that comes to mind is how to effectively slaughter and bleed them and that I want more tools in my toolkit for butchering them.
I want to extract the utmost life-force out of their flesh so I just looked up the ike-jime method.
The realization that they suffer from poor treatment and suffocation and their flesh has been proven to taste worse by many others in such cases fills me with excitement in learning new ways to kill and butcher them.
--- 2561993
>>2561986
That's an odd hobby
--- 2561995
>>2561993
That's just a minor hobby.
Since I'm good at butchering stuff everyone started coming to me when they did their fishing and I'm just getting good at fish too now.
There's only so much the flesh quality can be raised with proper butchering and cutting out pristine filÃ©ts, there's ways to kill and bleed them that also improves the quality even more so I had to start fishing too so I can kill them myself.

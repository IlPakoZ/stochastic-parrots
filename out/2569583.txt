Are there any good flavored vitamin powder mixes that are good when traveling and when might not be getting all the nutrients you should be getting? I started getting those mio liquid squirts and thought it may be better just getting a powder. Thanks. 

I know many people think multivitamins don't do anything, but at least it makes your water taste good.

Does your water taste bad?

Depends on where I am obviously. Different sources. I just thought flavor plus vitamins would be a good thing. Just wondering if any stands out to anyone.

Electrolyte drink mixes are mostly a meme. You need sodium, magnesium, and potassium, and I’m pretty sure potassium isn’t water soluble or something. It’s why most of these mixes don’t have much, and why it’s somewhat lacking in sports drinks. 

I bring Drip Drops because they taste bretty gud.

I just use Gatorade powder in a baby formula storage container.

I brought BCAA powder on my last mountaineering trip. It was some mixture with sugar, vitamins, electrolytes (mostly salt and magnesium) and a nice grape flavour. Theoretically the protein from the BCAAs should help preserve muscle and there's also evidence for a boost to endurance while the electrolytes and sugar are good for cramping and hydration. 
My appetite always drops past 3500m and by 4500m I struggle to force anything down at all. I still lost 15kg on this trip but I reckon the powder helped.

That said, I doubt vitamins would make a difference. Unless you're diet is already lacking then your body can probably cope with a month or two of even very minimal micronutrient intake.

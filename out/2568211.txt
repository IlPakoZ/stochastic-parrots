>stoveless camping
is this a meme? I do hate dealing with the things (and I have a pretty nice one). It adds weight and I'm so pooped at the end of a day crunching on a candy bar gives me as much enjoyment as a nice pot of stew. 
Anyone try it?

I take a lot of pleasure in cooking while camping. I like getting in touch with my ancestors who did the same. 
But I don't want to get in touch with my ancestors in the early pleistocene
You do you boo.

Maybe it depends on where you camp, but in the Pacific Northwest I really want a hot meal at the end of the day. . .and in the morning for that matter.

i live in grizzly country and it has been something ive thought about due to broadcasting smell when you cook but i've come to the conclusion that theyre gonna smell whatever you have hot or cold no matter what.
--- 2568240
>>2568211 (OP)
just take food that doesn't need cooking, there's no need to cold soak oatmeal
it doesn't have to be cans of whatever, dehydrated instant potatoes can be made with cold water for example, tortillas, crackers, cheese, dried meat and fruit, peanut butter, etc. it's really easy 
no hot drinks though

You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.

Not correct on a single point.

Yeah I usually just eat the animals raw that I kill during my backpacking trips. On my AT thru hike I ate a lot of raw fish. If I found a productive stream, I'd bag up 10 or so for the next couple of days and that kept me going. I took down some wild game every now and again. Small game, some raccoons and a big deer one time in Georgia. I ate it all raw. The deer lasted me a while. I had a harness on under my backpack and would drag the deer along trail and cut off portions whenever I was hungry. Never got sick or nothing. No need for one of those little stoves or tools for a fire, unnecessary weight.

when I was doing a section of the AT in north carolina, I met a guy that had crushed uncooked ramen noodles for dinner. i asked if he wanted any of my meal or if he wanted to use my pot/water to cook it and he just said "nah". then in the morning he tore open a packet of that flavored oatmeal and just poured it down his throat. kinda based, but why

Have hot chow is a morale booster. A small gasoline powered stove is light weight. Works for days on one tank. I would not do the cold slop.

cooking on the campfire is half the fun of camping. Not sure why you would subject yourself to cold gruel when you don't need to. If you want to be lazy just stay home and order takeout.

Correct. They'll smell a chocolate bar in your backpack in your tent from a mile away.

It’s pretty common. Just so the /k/ retards and newfags know, people do this when their focus is on hiking rather than camping. The idea is to save weight and hassle at the expense of comfort. The agreed upon term is “no cook” or “stoveless” (not very creative but that’s what everyone calls it). 

I’ve tried it and didn’t really find it to be worth the weight savings. My pack is pretty light, and for me it’s a substantial amount (percentage wise). But boiling water isn’t that big of a hassle, and prepared food just tastes a lot better. I’d never try it in colder weather. That just sounds miserable.
--- 2568401
>>2568211 (OP)
I do it pretty regularly.

I just pack trail mix and jerky and other snack foods. Why do these fags need to soak everything with water? You could probably do the entire AT just eating trail mix.

Cold soaking is mostly a hiking lots/camping little thing. Although it's a good alternative in summer to expand the meal options for non-hot food.

>>2568665
Not always an option depending on area, weather, or in the case of thruhiking mostly a lack of time.

Give it a shot OP, at least you'll know and expand your tool box.

tfw my wife used to take raw meat to uni for lunch. You can only imagine how autistic she looked chowing down on a bloody steak in the middle of the library with an anatomy textbook propped up in front of her. 
She still does it when we go hunting. 

We've done stoveless trips now and then when we've known we'd be cramming 4-5 days of distance into 2-3 days of hiking. Generally though, I prefer a nice hot meal or at least a hot drink when we're /out/.

Ahh this same single faggot who always says the same phrase again and again. Still trying to shill that reddit thur hiking with badly optimised ultralight shit sacrificing things that don't need to be given up to make up some story that camping and hiking are some itemised and always sperate hobby. Cold soaking is for faggots and you cold soak. God I'm glad you fuck faces stay in your smooth easy trails that are as groomed a a child around a tranny are. Take no risks, I don't want you anywhere near where hiking that matters takes place. I'll know you by your gear and fuck you up. That's how few of you fucks there actually are. Hammer your cunt face.

I eat 1000 a day at my desk job. When I'm innawoods, I generally triple that. Hot meals are where it's at. Also I always try to incorporate fishing in my hikes so, grilling fish is good for one of the nights but man... If you can ever catch you 2 or 3 brem or trout and fry up one by one, eating em as you go... That's the life.
--- 2570877
Maybe it's just a Marine thing, but I literally do not care. I don't even taste food anymore, I just scarf that trash and call it good. Food is just coal for the fire.

NTA, but they are separate things. 

The biathlon is a single sport in the Winter Olympics, but you wouldn’t consider skiing and shooting the same thing. They’re very much separate disciplines, just done back to back. Backpacking is the same in that hiking and camping aren’t the same thing, but are done back to back. Some people camp as a necessity between days of hiking. Other people (most of the vocal people on /out/, it would seem) prioritize camping, where comfort and fun at camp are more important.

Not really a meme, just a specific solution to an issue. The lack of fuel and stove is both a small pack weight and volume savings. Additionally it's one less logistical thing to deal with which if you need to resupply can be a important thing. The other possible is that it will save you time, since you are essentially doing your meal prep while on the move, you can extend your hiking hours. In the morning you can eat right away and (minor issue but still there) you don't have to wait to pack up a hot stove. On a longer multi-day those 15-30min savings can be a big deal.

Realistically though, you can also just start by reducing the amount of fuel you need overall. Come up with no cook options especially for breakfast and lunch is easy. You can also do things like cold soak meals and still just boil a little hot water to bring them to a nicer temp. This way you can carry less fuel (maybe just one can for example)) or something like an alcohol stove and a couple boils worth of fuel.

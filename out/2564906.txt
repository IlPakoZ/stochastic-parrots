Anybody have any experience doing seasonal work with NPS? I'm wondering how flexible the start/end dates are. I'm a teacher looking for something to do during my Junes and Julys, but I feel like I won't be able to get hired if I don't commit like 3-4 months. Is it unheard of for people to leave mid season?

Also, I'm willing to put up with NPS/Forest Jannie shit for at least a season to see how I like it. Just looking for something to do and make a little money and go /out/ sometimes. Not many good /out/ summer opportunities in FL, at least not that I'm aware of.

They aren't. It's a contracted position. Also enjoy your $10/h.

Position I was looking at would be more like $20/hr. Keep regurgitating stuff you hear I guess, not sure what you get out of it.

Check USAJOBS and create a saved search anon. Plenty of random grunt work for NPS, FW, and BLM always up.

You also don't have to work for NPS themselves to work in National parks, there's also concessionaire and conservation type jobs available through private companies

Yes, I will continue regurgitating the things I heard directly from the NPS when I applied. Your job shilling isn't going to work no matter how many threads you make for minimum wage, glowie.

Depends on the kind of work I imagine. I did wildland fire in between school yeara back in college and they had no problems with flexible start/end dates. That was with USFS, but I know people who did the same with the NPS.

I've worked three seasons with NPS. Met a lot of teachers who were able to come and ga as they pleased. Just need to be communicative about it.

I'm sure you can find a position that is flexible enough for you; send your application in and then immediately contact the person in charge of hiring to reiterate your interest and explain your limitations. I assume you're going for an interp position; those guys come and go so fast I can't keep track of them.

My parents are both teachers and they volunteer for the nps during the summer. They can camp for free and decide what they want to do instead of being told, while also getting to yell at people for walking on meadows and feeding the wildlife.

there are several old hotels in the park. You are probably thinking of Old Faithful hotel which is the biggest. But no, I worked at Mammoth Hot Springs. It was a blast. Lots of fun with female co-workers and tourons alike.

There are always lots of tourists from all over the World there. The Chinese usually come by tour grup bus and never go more than 1/4 mile from there bus so easy to avoid the hordes.

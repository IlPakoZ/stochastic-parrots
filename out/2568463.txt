Would love to, and have done in the past. Drove 3 hrs out of the city into the foothills. Found an abandoned haul road which had side roads that led to abandoned lease sites. Drove down one, hiked down a slope to the river, set up camp, set up my tent, built a fire, played the harmonica, drank a mickey of rye, sang to myself, talked to myself, listened to the river...
my god, it was magical.

Not this year. I just got a full-time job, now I will pay off my student loan, then I will need to save up some money and then I'm free. Ironic? yes.

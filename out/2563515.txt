for $2000 you can get a nice kit. if you stayed near the west coast or below the mason-dixon line you can easily live outdoors year round. food is always the big problem, i doubt you have ever been truly starving and how awful it makes you feel. unless you are raiding dumpsters or stealing how are you going to feed yourself?

Hey friend. I used to be NEET for 3-4 years. Had same vague aspirations as you to go 'live in the woods'. I'm now homesteading and raising livestock/poultry as well as agriculture. Did have to work for it, am still working here and there but am transitioning to living from farming. I never went the nomadic route but I do love roughing it in the mountains for days on end and I love the natural world as much as anyone. I've still got it in the back of my head to strike out McCandless style one day but for now I've got obligations here. I enjoy working on my farm, I know what it feels like to never think you'll be able to work but 'waging' in the typical McDonald's fry cook or Walmart stocker is not all there is to do and there is dignified work that is paid in an hourly wage, stuff that pays well too like manual labor. It's a means to and end and you won't have to do it for too long if you can live frugally and make smart decisions. 
You can be able to work, a person has a natural need to exert themselves toward things and you will find out if you go out in the wilderness McCandless style that you just landed in a full time mandatory overtime job, a great and fulfilling one if you know what you are doing and can take care of yourself. Old man told me once that work is just a four letter word. Humans 'work' to survive in the wild, it is the conditions of modern work that make it so our brains don't fully compute it with total fulfillment the way a wild man is totally fulfilled by his work. However, you can still be better off psychologically working a job with a goal in mind.
All that being said, I don't know you and maybe you do have the skills to do this. Knowing what most NEETs are like though it's not likely so I'm assuming not. If you don't, then at least practice them for a couple months and see how long you can realistically feed yourself first with 1 or 2 days then more and more. Godspeed

This is my first time visiting this board, and this was exactly the reason why I came here. I have around 2.2k in cash, and I am trying to gather as much information as possible on what I need to survive a 3-month trip in the wilderness. During the first few weeks, I could probably survive on spam while I learn to catch food. I have never fished in my life, but I should have some luck with a net instead of a fishing pole. If I have a reliable way of starting a fire, I guess I can just boil my drinking water. I'll buy a tent and a sleeping bag for the warmth and when may starts rolling in it should only get easier. If all fails and i end up breaking a foot in the middle of the jungle I still have a poison pill with me.

You'll probably die during the winter unless you're already an expert survivalist.
There's a big difference between surviving innawoods in summer vs in winter.
In summer there's mostly minor annoyances like bugs to worry about. In winter it's low temperatures, shit weather and no game. Good luck.

--- 2569303
If you learn primitive shelter, fire making, fishing and water cleaning techniques, surviving in the wild isn't that difficult. Obviously knowing how to identify edible plants and how to hunt land/air animals is beneficial, but in my experience it's less useful if you're talking about long-term wilderness living without resupplies. 
Chris' mistake was setting off into Alaska without first having a solid grasp of survival in a more lenient environment.
I think if you're starting from literally 0 wilderness experience, it'd be ideal to first find a survivalist class to learn basics in a safe setting.
It's a fun hobby, but I don't think I'd want to live in the wilderness for an indefinite period of time. Just being out there for 4 weeks starts weighing on me mentally.

Keep the money. 

Just have some clothing and a cheap first aid kit.

Maybe get rice, sugar etc

Get some books on local fauna and flora of that area.

Go there and ration you supplies while reading about what you can and cant eat

After a while you will then know what gear you will need to spend or save to get.
--- 2571287

simply not enough animals to eat anymore, without hunting linving in the woods is absolutely imopssible
--- 2571405
>>2571287
Maybe with that attitude. Dont listen to this coward

Even without animals you can survive on perseved foods but you need to supplement with fresh plants especially vitamin c. 

Obviously you still need some income to buy preseved food. But with no overheads this could be something nearby a few times a year... Gardening or something idk

Bro just keep the 2k.

Get yourself up to one of the big west coast cities. Like Portland or Seattle or LA or San Fran. Find the closest store that has gear like REI (if Portland go now they gonna close). 

So you just get a big cart and fill it up with gear and just go out of the store. No one will stop you not even the cops. Kinda hurry because they might try to close the doors if you have a lot of stuff but you can just start yelling about having to go take your meds and they will let you out.

Bro I know this first hand you can get a lot of great gear this way. I traded out of all my Walmart stuff doing this I got all good shit now.

You don't need $2,000.

You can survive with $0.

But you won't have the benefits of modernity.

Like modern medicine or science and technology.

This is just how the Indigenous man lived before colonization.

You can always get a place out in the country, with a steady income and a job.

Then you can enjoy being out in nature, while also enjoying things like hospitals and the internet and trucks and computers.

If you just want to get out in nature and backpack for a while, for weeks, for months, then get a solid pack, like 50L or 100L pack.

Then you can pack a camp, a means to purify water, a weapon/traps for fishing and hunting, a tool like an axe for building shelter.

This is how the Indigenous man lived, it's not far off from how a lot of rednecks live up here, and people on reservation land.

You can even camp with just a tarp and no tent, or build your own shelter, like bushcraft or traditional shelters.

You can get away with stealth camping, but at some point, the ranger may catch on to you and confront you.

If you are on public land, the park ranger will be on your tail, and you will have to move a lot.

You have 14 days, two weeks, within a 28 day period to camp on public land.

If you want to just be a vagrant, then hop between different sites.

I've been homeless, just doing migrant labor, lived in a shelter though.

Living like a wild man is certainly doable, but you will miss civilization and you will need a woman some day.
If you refuse to leave and insist on living on God's green Earth in a traditional way, you will go to jail.

But not on reservation land. Just respect the environment, cleaning your traces hides your trail too.

>If you want to just be a vagrant, then hop between different sites.
By that, I mean different parks. I have gone on long journeys across this country and just found shelter by camping on public lands and campsites, as well as hotels/hostels and such now and then as a treat. This land is vast and beautiful, full of bounty and majesty.

If you can't survive society, you can't survive innawoods.

If you're neet, there is something fundamentally wrong with you that will, likely slowly and insidiously, fuck you over.
Im not saying this to make fun of you, im saying to stress that mental health is the most important aspect. 
Maybe you have a lack of motivation, maybe you struggle with depression, maybe you just never learned to apply yourself, maybe you just can't take the suck (of a job or school), whatever. It's always something. Don't feel shame, get help and fix yourself up. It'll be okay.

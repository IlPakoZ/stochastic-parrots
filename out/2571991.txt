hey /out/ I'm probably getting posted out to rural or regional NSW, Australia for work. I have a house and family already established in metropolitan Sydney.
I'm thinking of getting a toyota hilux or a van and fit it with a bed or tent and sleep in it during my days on, and drive back to sydney on my days off. work roster would most likely by 4 days on, 5 days off.
With the ute, id need a roof top tent, probably need bullbars as well for kangaroos, and the ute would be handy for running errands. with a van, its big and heavy, can probably fit it out with lots things and turn it into a home.
anyone have pros and cons of ute vs van?

I've got a double cab lux and the try is too short to sleep its tiny really. If I was gonna build a camper Id get either an extra cap flat deck or just full single with even more deck space and then make some sort of pop up canvas setup on the deck. That's long enough to sleep in atleast. I see a lot of these big camper set ups people have but they just look really heavy and unwieldy. 

Something like this would be enough for me. Then id carry some tarps around to make more living space, maybe a whole canvas tent that folds with it.

Sleep diagonally in the tray. Or have tray gate down 90 deg to have xtra feet room. Swag and awning might be easier.

that setup is triggering my claustrophobia.
i figured if i got the double cab, id be able to use it as a family car also. but yeah, lest tray space. would definitely have to get a roof top tent.
a sprinter van seems less desirable now that i think about it. id be driving long distances to get to work and back home.

i thought about just sleeping in the car, but ive done that previously after nights drinking and could never get comfortable. id need to be able to get a good nights rest to get ready for work. sleep diagonally might not be ideal, or even be exposed to the elements with the gate down.
thats another plus for a van. space. but yeah, driving possibly 8+ hours to my work location in a heavy van doesnt sound fun

Always have recovery gear. Pulleys. Ropes. Chainsaw. Toilet paper and firestart stuff . Winch is always good. And non perishable foods for atleast a days worth.

How much space is there in the back of a 7-seater landcruiser? Flip the seats flat in one of those and I reckon they'd be pretty comfy. Less hassle than having to set up a tent every night.

going off this line of thought. what would be the best car/suv to sleep in?

I've got an 80 series landcruiser and camp often in vic, love my swag and awning but it's a bit of fuckin around setting and packing up every night if you're moving around. I've been toying with the idea of removing half the back seats and putting in a platform with a mattress on top, the convenience of just sleeping in the car I think would be awesome, but I take people out 4wding and it's also my daily so it's unlikely I'll do it, I'm sure there's plenty of downsides too. If you'd be living out if it no doubt you'd have a lot of gear with you eg- cooker, fridge/Esky, food, clothes etc so space would be an issue, unless you're cool with gutting most seats out and get creative with putting together or building a storage system

With a car you can sleep anywhere you want.

The North Cascades National Park bills itself as the "Alps of America". Do American anons really?
--- 2559925
>>2559921 (OP)
Yes the north cascades are the closest thing to the alps in the lower 48.
--- 2559929
>>2559921 (OP)
I don't know
What characteristics define the original Alps
--- 2559931
pretty unanimously the north cascades, most of the 49th parallel ranges are alp-esque from the pacific to montana.
--- 2559935
They're way more rugged than the alps and there is way less civilization and they're much more beautiful so the Alps are actually the Cascades of Europe instead of vice versa.
--- 2559977
>>2559935
But the real Alps are massive in scale compared to the cascades. Mt. Blanc from Lake Geneva is a sight you would expect to see in the Himalayas, but its in the Alps.
--- 2559995
>>2559921 (OP)
Alaska is several orders of magnitude better than the sun total of euroshit land.
--- 2559996
I like the Cascades

What makes an Alp an Alp?
--- 2560223
>>2559929
Rugged peaks covered in glaciers
--- 2560229
>>2559929
Being super steep
--- 2560233
>>2560223
>>2560229
sounds like the Tetons to me
--- 2560246
>>2560233
Tetons don't have many glaciers left, also a fairly small range.
--- 2560250
>>2560196
you have to be 18 to posy here.
--- 2560252
>>2559921 (OP)
So somebody said something? No way.
--- 2560254
>don't have many
>splitting hairs
but they do have glaciers, are stuper steep with rugged peaks. seem to fit the definition pretty well.
--- 2560255
>>2559921 (OP)
The Palisades, and the high peaks in the JMT portion of the PCT.
--- 2560257
>>2560254
But the north cascades fit it better
--- 2560264
>>2559977
the cascades have a few mountains like that, rainier, baker, and hood are all massive mountains. mt blanc and rainier are 11th and 21st in the entire world for their prominence respectively.
--- 2560292
>>2560192
Just live in Wenatchee and mine crypto.
Leavenworth kind of sucks for "living" compared to "visiting" anyway. There are two roads in the entire town that actually go anywhere. One of which is the Chumstick Highway.
--- 2560357
>>2559977
this. Mt. Blanc, at 4,000m is more similar in scale to an 8000m peak than a 4,400m peak in the Cascades
--- 2560359
>>2560357
*sorry 4800m
--- 2560388
>>2560264
Funny how there's no replies from the eurotards on this one
--- 2560391
>>2560388
Mountains? Those are volcanos. Volcanos that might erupt in the next 10-10,000 years. For what its worth they are massive and interesting to look at, but the Alps are larger in scale horizontally, the Mt. Blanc massif is wider and built like a wall compared to the conical shape of a volcano.
--- 2560394
>>2559929
Very deep valleys (some what true in the cascades), prominent stone massifs and peaks (Not really true in the cascades except 1 or 2 mountains) and a "lush" theme to them with lots of snow on the mountains and a vibrant feel to the greenery. Mostly true for both.
--- 2560399
>>2560391
>volcanoes

If you include all of North America as "America" then I would say the Canadian Rockies near Banff, Alberta
--- 2560402
>>2560394
How about dem Rockies?
--- 2560404
>>2560401
>>2560402
The Canadian Rockies are superior to the Alps. 

If you include all of North America than the Alps are completely mogged by things like the St Elias range and Alaska range.
--- 2560410
>>2560401
Don't forget Baffin Island.
--- 2560424
>>2560357
What does that even mean?
>this 4000m peak is actually more like 8000m
--- 2560432
>>2560424
Standard Eurocope
--- 2560434
>>2560391
i measured this, and giving mt blanc a very generous measurement it came out to ~40km in a generally NE direction. Mt Rainier is about 25km wide from all directions conically. A 15km difference in a single direction is obviously much bigger, but Rainier is in general a much more massive piece of rock, with similar glaciation and a much more dangerous environment overall due to the volcanism.
--- 2560437
>>2560424
Vertical prominence. A 1000 meter peak rising directly from sea level, like say an island, has more vertical prominence than a 500 meter peak that rises from land that is elevated even if the latter peak is higher.
--- 2560462
>>2560292
Okanogan is superior But you’ll never move here since rednecks and ndns frighten and confuse you.
--- 2560470
>>2560424
Sarcasm, obviously
--- 2560471
>>2560437
M8 the cascades are near the coast
--- 2560825
>>2560471
>St Elias range
Still, most of them are 8K to 9K tall if that. Thats a prominence comparable to the Colorado Front Range, not the Alps. I guess what I'm talking about here is "Jut", the overall vertical reel of the stone face. Here's the mountain with the #1 jut worldwide, Annapurna Fang.
--- 2560877
Why do people argue about shit that is objectively calculable? Some peaks have more prominence, some peaks have more glaciation, some peaks have harder ascents. Then subjectively you have different preferences on where to live/visit/talk shit. You guys don’t even go outside if you’re arguing about this
--- 2560878
>>2560825
>I guess what I'm talking about here is "Jut"
Oh god, please don't tell me the "Jut" spammer from Reddit's mountaineering sub has found his way to /out/

They are within 2 degrees of each other in longitude, so they get pretty much the same sun and are also somewhat close to the ocean.

Honestly I moved to Arizona in 2015 and I don't really see myself living anywhere in Washington again because I don't feel like moving again. But living in Leavenworth was kind of a pain in the ass. Less of a pain in the ass than living in Bellevue but still a pain in the ass.

A bit dryer and not nearly as broad, but the Wind River Range gives me similar vibes.
--- 2562133
>>2559935
Of course there's that one faggot thinking mountains are a competition.
--- 2562298
>>2559921 (OP)
The Cascades are the Cascades. The Alps are the Alps. Every mountain range has its own individual character and experiences to offer. There is no wrong answer to what your favorite mountain range is as it often comes down to personal experience, your own taste in aesthetics, and familiarity.
Personally, I found the Alps to be gorgeous, but I prefer the rugged wilderness of the Sierra Nevada myself.
--- 2562551
>>2562133
nice dubs but there are faggots ITT saying volcanos aren't mountains for the sake of their own argument, anon was just making a simple comparison between two similar slopes.
--- 2562702
>>2562298
lol ok fag
--- 2562735
>>2559921 (OP)
Sorry our mountains aren't up to your standards, anon; we'll get to work on making some new ones.
--- 2563384
>>2562298
I've lived on both continents and it just depends on what you want to get out of it. I also prefer the wilderness and lack of infrastructure in north america, the Alps are nice to look at and the valleys and mountain towns are very idyllic to me.
--- 2563453

Its not even about peaks. Just about freedom and mastery of the environment.
--- 2564988
>>2563453
What do you mean by hiking? American hiking is a far different experience than everywhere else on the world. Smooth clean trails. Pair of running shoes. Its kind of boring desu.
--- 2564990
>>2564988
Plenty of bushwhacking to be had, but it gets pretty tiresome over long distances.
--- 2565003
>>2564988
Lol wut
--- 2565026
>>2564990
Sure, bushwacking sucks when you have to go through willows and so on. 
What I don't like is hiking trails like pic rel. The whole trail looks like this. It looks like a park ranger goes over the trail with a broom and then a spatula to even out the bumps. 
I want terrain that few people walk on, barely visible animal trails, unmarked, pathless, open terrain or forest, pitch your tent anywhere, no ranger strangers.
If I can't get that I'm just going to put on a pair of trailrunners and run the whole thing, and call my mom to pick me up when it gets dark. I like trailrunning too, but it's a different thing. Camping and hiking is just not the real thing when its too civilized or supervised.
--- 2565063

--- 2565267

he's right tho
--- 2565277
>>2565267
you're either him, or you also need to go out more. it's an unfathombly stupid assertion.
--- 2565278
>>2565267
about what? about being so fucking autistic that hiking on a well maintained trail causes him to sperg out? I agree with that. But trails like pic related are a tiny minority of trails that i have experienced in the Western US and only the most high profile, well used trails are like that...there are 1000s of miles of all sorts of trails in a wide variety of conditions, terrain and degree of maintenence and suggesting trails like the one in the pic are the norm and not the exception is retarded.

>American
what part of america have you been to? america is a very big place, maybe you came to the wrong part.
the west coast is actually one of the only places in the world with old growth 'real' forests left.
to have the same experience overseas you have to go to siberia, the amazon rainforest, se asia's jungles, central africa etc. 
>>2565026
that section of trail is going to maintain itself from foot traffic. there's no large trees or anything around it to put organics in the soil, which is what makes it get all fucked up and muddy. some trail is pretty low maintenance especially if there's no equestrian or vehicles on it.

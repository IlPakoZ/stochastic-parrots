>watching some youtube camping
>it's recommended to me by the algorithm after watching Steve Wallis
>it's some English guy
>half his videos have product reviews where he compares whatever stove or boots or sleeping bag he has with the 10x other ones he has
>says in a video that he has 80 tents
>turn it off in disgust and remove him from recommendations
The guy seemed okay otherwise, but why are they so wasteful? Why does he have 10 stoves, 80 tents and 40 sleeping bags? dudes like that remind me of the kind of people that spend 15 grand on funko pops

The guy's channel was Paul Messner btw, I don't want to send clicks his way but I know people are gonna ask me who it was

People like consoooming for their hobbies over actually doing them. The product review channel gets a lot of clicks and it's easy to sell things through affiliate marketing.

There's good stuff on youtube but you must know by now that it's full of shills and profiteers.

People want to know how something they're gonna buy performs. That doesn't mean they're consoooooming instead of actually doing them, it means they're doing research. It's not like his viewers are buying 80 tents themselves.

Yeah, thing is the first few channels that I started watching were the real deal it's only when I branched out that I saw them, now I see that they are the norm probably

His videos just aren't that interesting, it's the equivalent of "camping" in suburban back yard. Just why bother?

It's probably just the business model of collecting affiliate link clicks. The larper Wranglerstar does the same.

He has all that shit because he makes a living reviewing it on Youtube. If you reviewed a $400 knife and made $2500 from the views, wouldn't you think about buying another expensive ass knife and trying it again? If he has solid reviews, people will want him to review things they are considering...and so he accumulates more gear and makes more money.

OP doesn't understand how business works
>this guy who's job is reviewing camping gear etc has more than the minimum gear for himself?? DISGUSTING

she died of ''suddenly'' nobody killed her

It was his responsibility to make sure she wasn't subjected to "suddenly" and he neglected that responsibility in favor of "muh stealth camping" in airport parking lots. He made a choice, and now she's dead.

I was unable to convince my wife not to get the ''suddenly'' either, the social pressure she felt was so much that she felt obliged to. I told her to take out a life assurance policy then, because I'd be needing it.

Thems don't think women be like that but they do

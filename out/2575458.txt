Backpacking trailers are like $1000 commercially. Has anyone ever made their own? Do they live up to the hype for hauling game out of the woods?

It honestly wouldn't cost shit to make one. I can make one with used shit for like 100$

But are they good? I'd be hiking 3 miles on a2-track, then 2-3 miles on extremely steep and rugged terrain. I'd probably have to leave the trailer on the road and drag a deer back to it. But at least it would make my last, tiredest 3 miles easier.

In the past 5 years. I have met my fair share of state/country walkers... They always opt to use a trailer with two wheels. The smartest one I've seen had a rail system with a slightly longer trailer- with cargo netting on top. So he could lay across the top without having to setup any ground system. Just used his standard bicycle tire/wheelchair tire setup.

I’ve never seen a hunter use one, but then again I’ve never seen a hunter who was very far from an ATV. Most people stick to what everyone else is doing.

I'll probably build one and report back in November, or sooner if I decide it's gay and don't bring it on my hunt.

Do you hold the bars over your shoulder like a yoke, or down near your waist like a wheelbarrow?
--- 2575762
>>2575664
They hook onto a waist belt.

I'm not a refugee that needs to pack 200lbs 900 miles.
I'm sure they're fantastic for packing your cooler and grill to the beach without friends helping but why would you want to...

You can just carry or drag your game.

You can also snap the ankles and use the tendons to make a fleshcraft deer backpack for easy carrying.

This is the kinda stuff that really freaks out the city people lmao.

Based NZ farmland. 

That's good fellow and red sized critters, Americans who shoot Elk have to carry the whole thing out and often a long way. I can see the value in one of those cart things.

My uncle did the white tail backpack thing. He came across a bear. The funeral was pretty sad, but the wake was a blast. I nailed his step daughter. Good times.

I've used one a few times while hog hunting with my bro, they work a lot better with trails than game carts due to the single wheel.

That's literally a wheelbarrow wheel and two broom handles. The ends for the axle looks like EMT someone flattened in a vice and painted white. $50 in materials and they are selling for $1500?? I'm starting a hiking trailer company...

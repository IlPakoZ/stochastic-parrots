How immoral is it to poach small game like Jack Rabbits and Javelina in a south western National Forest? If there are any game and fish folks that could fill me in on the consequences. I’m relatively educated on the ecological effects of hunting and I’ll take that into account, but are their any other consequences to consider?

>Morality of poaching

Most people don't know the true meaning of the word "poacher".

They think a poacher is the guy they hear about on the news who shoots a trophy deer and only takes the head leaving the rest to rot, or the guy who kills a bear taking only the gall bladder and claws. These aren't true poachers, they're slob hunters. The true poacher is a meat hunter, a man of the woods, fields, and rivers. He knows and respects the game he hunts. He takes the time to learn the ways of the wild creatures and all that surrounds them. He sees the natural world as a giant classroom and tries to learn all the lessons hidden within it. The true poacher will be able to interpret what he sees, hears , or smells in the woods, whether is be a track in the mud, the scolding of a jay, or the smell of a beaver along the riverbank. The true poacher is a highly skilled hunter, his level of skill is much higher than the "sportsman" because the true poacher is hunting for his dinner. If the "sportsman" comes home empty handed its no big deal, hell go to the nearest market for food. The real poacher on the other hand depends on his skill in order to feed himself and even his family, therefor he takes the job more seriously. The true poacher maintains a much higher awareness level than the sport hunter, because he is not just the hunter, but also the hunted.

I'm not a warden but the consequences are greater than you think. Start with your firearm or bow being taken away, then a stiff fine (probably $400 per javelina) for hunting out of season or illegally taking game, another $200 for no license, another $50 to $100 for court costs, and wrap it up with loss of hunting AND fishing privileges in all 50 states for at least a year. Consider hunting legally instead of poaching, it's much easier in the end. One more thing: Once you've been busted for poaching you'll always be considered a poacher to Fish and Game as well as everyone in the county. It could impact your future job searches.

--- 2562988
>>2562983
I’m a local and I intend to use the animals only for food. But the laws are very restrictive on hunting, even Javelina, weirdly when their meat isn’t popular. Obviously I would try my best to avoid getting caught.

When it comes to poaching if you do it out of necessity no one with judge you. If you take all of said animal and the items you used to take it ie bullets, trap or arrows. it will be as normal as nature, but if you go for big game such as deer or elk as the larger and leave said carcass you effect the lands you love as much as the corporations that seek to own and destroy it. So if needed to take smaller game or large game more sparingly, if you just want to hunt then go about the legal way and get a 12 gauge and find which animal is in season as the 12 gauge is the most versatile across multiple species.
--- 2563075
>>2562921
Poachers being deprived of their weapon, their money and/or going to jail is natural selection in action. 
Humans evolved to despise them and wish them out of their tribe. This is simply nature at work.

The moral part is you've taken wild game that the state has taken claim to.
The morality of the state taking what belongs to you(ie tax) is a similar moral question.
They have the means of violence to back up their claim, do you?
Or can you avoid the states violence?

Doesn't sound like it's a moral question for you, sounds more like you're asking is the risk worth it or not?
If you're hungry cause the state taxed you too hard I'd say yes to both the moral and the risk/reward question.

The morality of poaching is dictated by your local laws. If the laws make sense, if they're guided by principles of conservation, and if they're keeping the ecosystem healthy and balanced, then poaching is very immoral. However, if the laws are unreasonable and/or are actively harming the ecosystem, then poaching is probably not so bad from an ethical point of view.

However, in either case, you will have to face the consequences if you're caught, 
and those consequences can potentially ruin your life. You have to ask the question: is it worth it?
--- 2563367
>>2562886 (OP)
Poaching is theft of natural resources from the public in general and legal hunters in particular. Thieves should be maimed or killed.

>jack rabbits
Rabbit season is 365 days in Arizona and probably other states where they're abundant. Just get a license you cheap faggot.
>javelina
Medium game, not small, and hunting is restricted by season to protect their population.
--- 2563393
>>2562886 (OP)
if you're taking the animal in a respectful way and not taking more than you need it's perfectly moral. it's only illegal because the citizenry cannot be expected to follow those guidelines. if you get caught it would be disastrous though so maybe it's not worth it for some rabbits or porkers

I've been banned from /out/ many times for naming the jew but you're a little off the bullseye here. I'm neither 100% pro or anti poaching, so much depends on the species and other factors. For instance, the burrowing owl is likely to become extinct in my lifetime. Should we do what we can to save it? I believe we should, including prosecuting anybody to intentionally kills or harms one. On the other hand, point creep is so bad, and F&amp;G response so inadequate that elk hunters are beyond frustrated. It's possible that an elk hunter will never draw a lowly cow tag in his lifetime, and I'd at least understand his state of mind if he poached one. I'm not saying let him off without penalty but I wouldn't throw the book at him if he took a cow in season and didn't waste the animal. Personally, I follow the rules to a T and I'm active in my state's game law legislation. The laws aren't perfect but they've prevented wholesale slaughter of wild game.

The moral part would be less about ownership rights and more a tragedy of the commons thing
I don't think anyone really believes the government has actual moral ownership of the wild resources they manage, but their management (supposedly) represents the common ownership of the people. The deer don't belong to the president like a feudal lord, they belong to the country as a whole, with the citizens in the country able to hunt them as they wish. But there's >300 million people in the states and only ~30 million deer, so obviously not everyone can just go out and shoot one or they'd go extinct in a month, so there needs to be some system to limit how many get taken. That extends to everything in nature, from the deer to the trees to the javelina. There's no inherent moral problem with hunting out of season or in banned areas specifically, those are artificial rules established by people, not nature, but there are moral issues with choosing to ignore rules that others choose to abide by for the common good. Yes it's mostly harmless as long as relatively few people choose to break them, but by breaking them you're taking an unfair advantage over the people that aren't, and relying on the other people to continue following the rules or lose access to the resource altogether from abuse. 
Sometimes that's fine, there's no universal solution to morality and in many cases the harm from breaking a rule is insignificant and the benefits outweigh it easily, or they're more balanced and it's a grey area that requires personal judgment, cases need to be examined individually, but as a rule of thumb breaking rules that exist to establish cooperation tends to be immoral. 

That said, yeah OPs question is more about risk/reward and uses hes struggling to put food on the table he should just get a license and stick to legal game.

Anyone who hasn't been banned from a side board for [how dare you be racist!} is doing it wrong.
My grandpa was one of the farmers in Montana that started game conservation. It was a gentlemen's agreement with the neighbors and they closely controlled the herd sizes for decades.
There is no good solution but lots of bad ones.

Fun fact: I can absolutely use legislation to tell you what to do on your property. Your house is up to (((code))) and all your guns should be registered.

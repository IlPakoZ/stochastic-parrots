Has anyone ever broken the rules while fishing? Targeting fish out of season, keeping fish out of slot size, keepingmore than your limit, etc.

Normally I fish a huge lake but 2-3 days before the season actually opens I go to a very small pond and catch some drinks. That's it

I fished a protected area. Some friends I fish with found a new spot that was pretty close to a Marine Protected Area, and they landed some huge fish, I brought up that it's pretty close to the MPA and they said "No its not we checked multiple maps" a week later I went with them, it was a cool spot, I didn't keep anything. 2 weeks later I went by myself and now had an app that showed protected areas and realized we clearly fished in the MPA, when I brought it up to then they were "huh that's weird, we didn't really check" since then I don't really fish with them and when I do I take my own vehicle so I can just leave when they pull stuff like that

Are there any hatch charts for southern Utah? Searching up Utah hatch charts always gives northern rivers, specifying southern Utah gives the same results, and searching up specific bodies of water turns up other bodies of water multiple states away that share the same name.

Replying from previous thread, thanks for the tip! Used a largish foam grasshopper and caught this one today. Extreme pain in the ass to land by myself with 4x tippet in pic related net. I had one on earlier but it broke off as I was trying to hand line it in at the end, one head shake just clean broke off the fly without the protection of the bendy end of my rod since the line was in my hand. Crunched down the barb so hopefully able to free itself. Wore pic related down for a longer time before trying to hand line it into the net.

Any recommendations for a larger net? This thing was like $25 on amazon and has proved super dependable but I think I need to upscale if I keep going after carp in my neighborhood pond. Please keep it cheap because the net I have is a quarter of the cost of similar nets with a rubber mesh and it has yet to fail, so I doubt I need some of those retarded $200+ nets.

I just use a dip net to catch nongame fish. I'm sick of trying to set up a rod.

>be europoor
>you need a lisence of every single lake 
>you can't really fish on rivers at least in southern germany (impossible to get into the fishing clubs which have the fishing rights)

the one downside about being able to fish anywhere you want at anytime is that 75% of the spots look like dump sites. people just throw trash everywhere like retards.

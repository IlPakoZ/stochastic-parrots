What kind of vidya do you like to play when you're /out/?
--- 2563039
Kys
--- 2563071
None

Switch is nice, but I don't have one any more, would be fun to play some Crash Bandicoot while /out/
--- 2563426
>>2563028 (OP)
Sometimes I bring a controller to play retro games on my phone.

nintendo dsi or ds lite + gba and ds flash cart,
or a gameboy sp with a backlight mod is also acceptable.
those are the endgame /out/ devices. they have massive battery life, they're pocketable, they're oldschool nintendo quality products that can be thrown around, they fit in a pocket, and they have a clamshell design to protect the screen. 
the 3ds and switch are too easily breakable outdoors.
chink emulator handhelds are getting good but the build quality isn't older gameboy level so they're not as good. 
when i was a kid in boy scouts i had a sega gamegear and a gameboy pocket.
--- 2563480
I'd play oldschool runescape if I could be bothered, but that's not why I go out
--- 2563493
Nothing but sometimes I bring my laptop to cood during camping trips

remember that the original gameboys have daylight viewable screens, thus making them the ultimate out gaming machine. IPS mods are fucking ass for that reason. I do keep a 3ds in my camper van because it has a massive library of games + custom firmware and can charge with 5v USB. Its nice to have after a long hike, rainy day, or night time.I prefer to carry a waterproof ereader tho for multi day hikes or times when it will be sunny and I have spare time.

I have a powkiddy v90 specifically for this purpose. Runs off of easily swappable batteries and runs GBA/super nintendo. Form factor is nostalgic, I just wish the chinks that made it put a little more of a powerful processor in the thing, I would've paid another 10-15 bucks for it to run Silent Hill and Resident Evil better.
--- 2563533
CPS, RDAC, Tuner, RM, Linkplanner, Winbox, cnMaestro, Armada, PuTTY, Firefox, Word, Excel, Google Earth. 
And Quickbooks. I like to get paid.

You sound like overworked IT gizmo fag that goes car camping once a month in his mall crawler truck and while you camp all you do is watch Netflix downloaded to a tablet
--- 2563538
>>2563537
I don't watch movies, and my job is /out/side.
Also fuck infotech in general. 

Hope to do some more long-distance couple-days trips this summer. Burn some of the hotel points I've accumulated this winter.
--- 2563545
>>2563028 (OP)
It can't be summer yet, it's too soon

Shirley, you can't be serious.
--- 2563657
>>2563572
>can't be serious
Endless hot water, free wifi, a real bed, and a restaurant on site?

It's even better when I can bill the customer for it and mileage, then take the next day or two off to go ride the area, while staying at a hotel on points.

Not that there's any time when your camping to do anything, there's always a job to be done. That's why a love it it, if you do get a moment to relax your really relax properly. 

That said, one day I hope someone makes a VR dragon hunting game where there's a bunch of pokemon go style VR dragons rendered into the landscape and you go out hunting them and when you get to the location you put your VR headset on and it's animated a freaking dragon into the natural land scape. That'd be freaking awesome.

I hope you fall into a pond and drown while hunting for a basedachu

You can just leave food everywhere and find the bear dragon

I don't have time to play games when I'm out

I ended up 'car camping' in my jeep a bunch of times. I'd drive out of town and find a wooded spot and sleep in the back, with the seats folded back you can just barely lay totally stretched out on a 3 inch foam matt and sleep well, and ended up doing this a dozen times before I started bringing my old 3ds and playing the old zelda's and mario's. shits cash. now when i go camping I always bring it just in case. Also, I sometimes take 3d pics of my dick jsut for fun

What is that device? Why does it have a giant touch pad instead of a clit mouse?
--- 2565812
>>2565634
>giant touch pad
anon, nothing about this computer is "giant". Does have full-size ports though (USB, HDMI, Ethernet, RS232, headset) which is nice. None of the bullshit dongles like the ultralight laptops or tablets have.

But, carrying that plus all my climbing gear and tools up 20 flights of stairs to the roof because of some bullshit elevator problem, I'm glad to have something that's 1/4 the size/weight of my real laptop.

>taking video games outside
no thanks
what if I get them dirty
--- 2565846
>>2565812
You should still see if they make something with a clit mouse. They're the best, and your keyboard could be that much larger
--- 2565855
>>2565846
>clit mouse
nah. I have one on my dell, and disabled it. Don't care for it.
Another tech I work with swears by them, to the point where he disables his trackpad. I can't use his computer.

Looks like a GPD Micro. They make some pretty capable machines for their size. I have a Pocket and can play most games in my Steam library on it.
--- 2568755
>>2563028 (OP)
You jew
--- 2568758
i literally have not touched a video game since 2016. who the fuck plays games as an adult?
--- 2568760
>>2563533
You want me to pat you on the back, anon?
--- 2568773
Why would you even play console when you willingly go out?
--- 2568787
>>2568758
>who the fuck plays games as an adult?
Literally millions of well-adjusted adults occasionally play video games in their downtime. 
Weird flex but okay.

as a "gamer", wtf? why would i take vidya /out/? if i wanna play games, i'll say home. /out/ is about enjoying the outdoors, not technology
--- 2568871
>>2563028 (OP)
NES games on GBA
--- 2568933
>>2563028 (OP)
Mostly i just bring a small radio and a book for entretainment, i feel like vidya is too fragile, do you bring yours with a hard case?
--- 2568946
>>2563028 (OP)
I bring my old Gameboy SP, loaded with Fire emblem, Advanced wars and shit like that.
--- 2568965
>>2563028 (OP)
Bringing a switch seems like a bad idea. A DS is the best option. It's smaller and more durable. It's not like you're going to spend much time playing vidya when you're /out/, like when you're not tired enough to sleep yet, or if its day and you just need to kill time.
--- 2568988
Tablet with a hard case and bluetooth gamepad.
Get to watch movies in the tent at night or play whatever
--- 2570254
Super mario advance 4, it's basically the all-starts version of sm3 but on the gameboy advance. I've played it on trips ever since I was a kid and I'll probably still play it for an eternity

kino.

downgrading tech for /out/ is peak comfy

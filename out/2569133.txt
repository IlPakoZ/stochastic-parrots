Well you didn't even say what the fucking camera is for. Is it for taking pictures of scenery? Close ups of plants? Moving objects like birds or other wildlife? Phone is just the easiest choice since you're probably carrying it anyway.

Landscape and wildlife photos

scenery is pretty good with what I have but they feel grainy when I try to take wildlife photos
--- 2569169
>>2569168
like this is the best bird photo I could get

I use a fujifilm x-e3. It's lightweight and very nice.

Pretty much this. I check the raw picture some of the rugged cameras (not the most expensive ones) and the picture was barely better than the picture made with a phone.

>>2569270
can second this.

I hike with a DSLR, post photos on IG saying it was with my DSLR but 90% of them were just with my iPhone. A phone is plenty good enough in this day and age.

Zoomer take. Even compact cameras like the Sony RX100 take noticeably superior photos than phones do and the difference is magnified when you zoom in.

I see what you did there

Yeah but I'm talking about roughed ones (and not the high end ones). A normal compact like that Sony is much better that a phone. So my thought here is that it's not worth getting a camera if it can't make better picture than a phone.

You'll thank me when you need to zoom.

do you want small? If so get a sony rx100m7 or whatever the latest version is. If you want an interchangeable lens camera get an OM system OM5 - again because it's small, also water resistant and has nice features

I find my phone to be pretty good for most scenarios.
Huawei P30 pro.
>pic related 
I do photography, albeit of models, so know how to make it look how I want it to look on manual.
If you want something lightweight, hard wearing that'll take amazing photos digitally then I'd recommend a Ricoh GRIII or GRIIIx
It'll make you look like a pro photographer just by pointing in the right direction and pressing the button. Can handle wide landscapes, macro mushroom shots and low light.

Canon M200 and 11-22mm lens. Just donâ€™t get it wet.

Got a used Sony a5000 a while back, pretty happy with it. Small, has interchangable lenses, and durable enough to survive me knocking it off the table like a palsied caveman.

Is your brilliant take that bad cameras don't take good photos so you shouldn't get a camera?
--- 2570477
>>2569133 (OP)
Phone cameras are typically fine but if you wanna get into the hobby interchangeable lenses are the go to. Pentax Q for smallest and lightest system, I picked one up for 100$ too. Like that one anon said sony's a5000 is another small but really good system to use, I find a lot of people online using it more often than other cameras. If you got dosh and are really into it just get a new fuji, xt4 is fine

I have a galaxy a53 and it's pretty good for nature stills but its hard to get a good zoom of birds

Tried to get a pic of this swan a few times and its always a blob when I zoom

The one you have with you
Failing that, a budget option is to find a early to mid-2010s DSLR with a detachable lens. If you want to take pictures of wildlife you'll need to find a compatible telephoto/zoom lens. You should have at least 200mm focal length on that unless you wanna get good at getting close
I'm a filmfag so I don't have any specific suggestions for digital models but I know a lot of Canon and Nikon DSLRs of that era are pretty cheap right now

This isn't a resolution issue, it's an optics issue. Phone cameras just don't have the focal length and "digital zoom" just blows up the pixels

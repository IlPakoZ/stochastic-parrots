Yes I agree no one should even think of visiting Texas let alone moving to it.

fat people, clear cut everywhere, retards that claim to love God, but hate his creations. Never has a place hated trees and wildlife so much. The government encourages clear cutting and wildlife destruction. The hunters in texas shoot farm raised animals in fenced in yards. Every way that the average texan interacts with nature is despicable. They hate all animals; they just want to shoot them.

They also love to shoot each other. Swear they have a school shooting twice a week.

Plus it's flat and brown. Just an ugly state

It’s one giant strip mall with barely an inch of public land. It’s the worst of everything in America.

Texas has the southernmost section of the Rockies which has flora and fauna unique in the US.

South Padre Island has the most remote seashore in the southern US.

Caddo Lake in east Texas is the largest flooded bald cypress forest in the world and a unique paddling area.

Monahans Sandhills has the steepest sand dunes in the US.

LEL

Big Bend alone is roughly the same size as all the Utah NPs combined, but has 18x fewer visitors.

Yeah I guess if you like to hike in crowds Utah is awesome.

TX retards never know what they are talking about. The average true western state is 51% or more public land. Utah has 50,000sq mi of just NFS and BLM lands. West TX montane biomes also suck ass compared to the actual mountain west montane biomes and this is further evidenced by the maximum average annual snowfalls in TX being less than 1/10th of those in even Arizona or New Mexico mountains.

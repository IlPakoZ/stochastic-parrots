What is your choice for a one-man tent that won't fall apart if I breathe too hard on it? Low weight and portability are appreciated. Bonus points for muted colors/camouflage so I can use it on hunting trips.

3 Season - been using a big agnes copper spur for almost 7 years at this point. not as light as the newer tarp tents but i like the freestanding for the flexibility. it's getting a little worn down and i'll probably be looking to replace it in the next year but will definitely be what i compare what i get next against

winter - msr access. i'm located in northern MN so while our winters are legit it's still what could be considered below treeline and the msr tent has been treating me well. this tent works but think there are better options for the money. only reason i got this one is because it was an awesome deal on REIs return rack (returned for "not being warm enough" lol)

If I were in the market for a new shelter, I’d go with a tarp and bug bivy. Stone Glacier makes a pretty interesting tarp. 

I like the idea of beaks. It just seems like a no-brainer. I also like side pulls, which you rarely see on ground tarps. They also make an accessory door that can be left at home if you’re expecting fair weather. 

Unfortunately some mongoloid decided the foot end should be sewn shut instead of being a door. And I’m not sure why the side pills are on a flat felled seam instead of reinforced timeouts. That seam is more likely to fail (leak) before a pullout would tear, but maybe it just seems that way.

I'm trying to decide on a tent rn. Not super worried about weight but obvs lighter is better. I don't know a huge amount about tents so I may be really off base with some of my assumptions and thoughts so I'd love a little guidance. I'm considering two tents that don't necessarily have much in common other than lacking eye-rape colors. Fwiw this is mostly for mil larp and milsim events.

Dustin x-mid: I like that this tent seems to offer an easy pitch and is a fly-first design, but obviously the biggest benefit is the weight. While weight isn't a huge concern of mine, I'm not gonna pretend I want to disregard it entirely. I will not have trekking poles so I'd probably have to pick up those poles they sell explicitly to replace the trekking poles on their tents or something similar. It seems like this would be a very comfortable tent with a lot of storage space for me to be able to have my ruck out from the rain, while still separate from my sleeping area. My biggest concern is that I'm not always sure the ground space would be available given that it requires more ground space than many tents it would seem, and that it's pretty tall/high profile.

I'm also looking at the litefighter and Fido tents. Am I correct in thinking he primary difference between them is the poles used being heavier on the Fido? Tbh think this seems like a great option, with my one major concern being that I live in the PNW and I think I'd like a fly-first design, and I'd like some ventilation given that geres gonna be a lot of night with the rain fly. That being said, I'm not ultimately concerned about that as long as everything else is good.

Obviously these are very different tents. I have mainly slept in bivvies as an adult, so I need some advice.

It’s true; reputable brands do have a higher standard of quality control and better testing. I’ve heard that a lot of Taiwanese or my Vietnamese manufacturers have surpassed the US in this regard, but who knows.

I wonder what the hydrostatic head rating is on the tents posted in this thread. Are they using DAC poles? Why did some chose nylon (which can wet out and stretch) over polyester (which is stiffer, more waterproof, and more UV resistant) for their rain fly?

This is good advice, at least if you've never owned a true 1-person tent before. When I got my first true 1P tent (a Dan Durston X-mid) I was a little surprised at just how little room there was inside the bug net. I came from a Black Diamond Distance (2P but in reality too cramped for 2 people) and before that an MSR Hubba Hubba. I don't dislike the X-mid or anything but I was really not expecting to have so little room inside (although the vestibules are more than enough to stash gear and spread out - some would even say they are too big).

>>2570009 (OP)
Several years ago I bought this fjord nansen tromvik 1. It's two wall, and thus quite heavy: 1.6kg.
I did see several one person tents side by side. I personally dislike those coffin-shaped ones.
If I were to buy a tent now, it would be >>2570014 (naturehike cloud up 2) - larger, lighter, and still reasonably rainproof. 

That tromvik 1 I own fits literally a single person inside, almost all your stuff needs to stay outside (it's a two-wall tent, so "outside" means outside chamber, not tent).
I'm slim, so I lie with my head towards the narrow end of the tent to fit some stuff I prefer to keep inside by my knees.

Fjord nansen is a somewhat renown brand in my country, but still the interconnection of the pole segments was done in a way that fails unless you fix the design flaw yourself. The problem is that to connect two segments - metal tubes - there is another thinner tube fitted inside one of the segments; when the inner tube gets loose and moves inside, the connection fails. I've seen the same design flaw in many other tents as well.

On the other hand, that tent is quite tall (I can sit inside without touching the "ceiling") and long enough for a tall person, and it does well in heavy rain. In general, the dimensions are thought out if you're fine with keeping your backpack (or bike panniers) between the outer and inner wall.

As far as one man tents go, the MSR Hubba is ok because it's footprint (without vestibule) is maybe 1mx2m, it's really easy to find a good spot.
You can also just leave the inner tent home, if you want to save weight and there are no insects.
Or you could use just the inner tent with a light DD tarp or, if the weather allows, nothing at all.
Best thing i like about it, it's self standing, so as long as you put your backpack into the tent so it doesn't fly away, you don't even need to pin it down.

The litefighter is sold freely but it was designed for army use. Hence the largely pointless overbuilt design and material choice. I agree that anyone actually camping has way better choices.

>>2576292
No I'd say that's right. It's a metric that's easily discussed and communicated and has a straightforward correlation with performance. But your 6kg and mine are not the same, nor are they in different trips.

On topic, tarps really do have a ton of flexibility. If you're not in a very bug prone area where you need to do a lot of tasks inside the bug net, using a bug bivy is not really that different. Even then it's a matter of how often does that problem occurs.

If your french tents are canvas then they're the older models, which are a lot harder to find now. The Litefighter 1 is 4.6 pounds, the TCOP and the ICS are both around 6.5, but if you're crying about weight sub 10 pounds then you're not likely to be satisfied with anything surplus.

It’s true. The Anon above me mentioned the DD tarp tent. Look at this monstrosity. 12 pegs, 8 guylines (five 1m and three 2m), and a pole other than your trekking poles. Only two teeny tiny ventilation ports. Itty bitty vestibule. Nice weight though but man, it looks like a shit design. 

Why can’t non-Americans into lightweight backpacking gear? Ubiquitous designs like the Lunar Solo/Ultaplex/The One/Notch/Flash Air and the two person designs of those same models are ubiquitous for a reason.

Kind of, they give you straps to form a base rectangle without the inner tent.
The producer claims that with the straps you can pith the outer tent first in the rain.
A piece of string is a much mode lightweight replacement for that.

Either your estimate is wrong, or the hubba is for midgets. The inner tent of Tromvik 1 is 220x90-70cm iirc, and the outer is more like 2.5x2m.


>>2576298
> I don’t believe you either because of your ridiculous claim of an 18kg (40lb) base weight.
I did start with ~18kg a couple of times. Doable, but inconvenient. Then, that in in the 00's, my lightest tent was 2.2kg, plus 2l water, stove &amp; food for three days, 1kg sleeping bag, camera, rain jacket, and the backpack itself made altogether already 10kg. And you still need a flash light, some clothes, batteries for camera, phone charger, soap&amp;toothpaste, paper maps (I didn't have a GPS in 00's) etc.
I did take few "comfort" items or "just in case" items like a compact multi tool or a foam sleeping pad and each of these does contribute to the total weight.
Now went down to ~12kg (with food&amp;water for a day).

Unironically the River Country Trekker Tent 2.2. People have complained about water leakages and stuff with this tent. I put on some seam seal, I hosed it down for probably about 10 minutes, and it was completely dry on the inside. Never had a problem with water, it does stay kinda hot when the humidity is bad. 
I like it, I like the aesthetic, it works. I still get filtered trying to 'pitch' it right on my first attempt and usually end up setting the poles too high or setting up the lines on the sides too tight. Time to practice again now that the weather is decent.
3lbs tent, I think mine is closer to 4lbs now after I put the seam seal on.

Yes, but not everywhere do you have such insect density. If you are pitching your tent in the alps above 1500m or so, there are no insects that bite and fly.
Large areas of the US are basically desert. Large areas of Europe west of France are dry as fuck too.
>~12kg (with food&amp;water for a day)
I think you still can do better. If it's just for a day you likely don't need much of the stuff breought just in case.
Then again, 12kg is acceptable if you keep it below 250 or 30km a day.

Neither did you, if you don't use maps.
Show proof or fuck off.

I'm neither >>2576133 guy nor a retard who does not count things one carries in the backpack to its mass.

And good luck hiking without a map when all trails are marked the same, many trails cross each other and the signs on the crossroads (if any) are as bad as this one: 'le sépey' to the right and 'le sépey' to the left. My coin toss chose the one that was 1.5h longer...

I get that there are some cliché trails like the Camino de Santiago where you don't need map, food, tent (or anything else, for the locals are ready to offer you any service or sell you anything you may need).

This is a thread where we discuss tents.
You don't take a tent when you hike "just for a day".
You take a tent when you know that there's no chance for a mountain hut or any other place to stay and the next human settlement with a shop is in X days away.

What are you on about? The vast majority of people on the AT carried the AWOL guide when I went.

Guys, quit the flame war on whether some anon hiked some meme trail or not.

This is a one person tent thread. Tell us what's your tent / tent-replacement equipment and what (dis)advantages it has. How big it is, self-standing or not, rainproof, tears or falls apart, tall enough to sit in it or you can merely crawl inside, etc. That's what we should argue about.

>quit the flame war
It's fun though
>Tell us what's your tent
Currently I use the MSR Hubba NX. As someone who has used it for thousands of kilometres I wouldn't recommend it. The main problem is that it isn't water proof. Both the bottom and the outer tent have a low hydrostatic head. It's also a bit heavy compared to the competition. The tent definitely has pronounced strengths or I wouldn't have used it for so long.
I'm looking to upgrade eventually, so I am considering the Six Moon Lunar Solo, the Liteway Pyra Omm or maybe even a Zpacks. Does anyone have experience with these tents?

You don’t need a map for the AT. I’m nb4 whatabout this Boomer lady who got lost and died? You kind of need a guidebook.

>>2576718
NTA. Guthooks/FarOut and The AT Guidebook/AWOL’s aren’t maps. They’re guidebooks. They have info on distances, and yeah, they give directions in some places, but that doesn’t make it a map. They have info about points of interest, elevation profiles, hostel and resupplying info (like where grocery stores and posts office are located and when they’re open), water sources, shelters… to equate that to a GPS “because GPS wasn’t a thing” is fucking stupid. That’s not just me being a pedantic asshole. Look at one of them and you’ll see that it’s not the same as a paper map (or map app, or handheld GPS). 

Nobody is bringing a guidebook (usually in app form) to keep from getting lost on the AT. Tons of people bring a guidebook for logistical reasons. Some people bring a GPS, but it’s pointless. I’m not sure anyone brings paper maps, but they probably do. I mean once you hike it, even some sections of it, you’ll see what I’m talking about.

I was on the AT at the same time as AWOL in 2001. Most people used the AT Guidebook by Dan Bruce. I don’t think there was an alternative. Dan retired in like 2008, and AWOL took over and the guidebook changed names. I’m not exactly sure when people started using handheld GPS, but I’m pretty sure it was pre-2008.

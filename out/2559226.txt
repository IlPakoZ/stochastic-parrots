By summer I assume you mean hiking season from April to October and Mountains from June to September.
Most high quality boots sold in the US have goretex inside. That's not something you want for summer hiking, not even in Montana.
Try to find one with full leather inside and out for the summer. Your feet will be drier and won't stink. With goretex inside you have to change socks 3 times a day in summer, and you'll have fungal infections within a few weeks of hiking. I wouldn't recommend a mix of fabric/leather on the outside of the boot for Montana weather either because it'll just wet through much quicker than full leather.

This is actually a nice boot for summer >>2559295
https://www.hanwag.com/us/en-us/men/trekking/tatra-ii
if you get the leather version.
A (girl)friend of mine wore this boot for more than an entire year straight backpacking the world. Unfortunately it doesn't fit me otherwise I would have loved it too. The stiffness of this boot is at the upper end of normal (mountain) hiking boots but not too stiff or not as stiff as hunting/autumn boots. It also breaks in nicely and gets more flexible.

If you like more stiffness and a more solid feel this is a boot you can also use in autumn in the mountains when there's already snow and in the field when its very wet, and during mild winters:
https://www.hanwag.com/us/en-us/men/trekking/yukon-wide
as well as in the summer because it doesn't have goretex. Its just a little overkill maybe on regular touristy hiking trails. I had the Hanwag Alaska for a long time - great boot for cooler wet weather - which is basically the same just with goretex.

Well i was wearing them on hikes(probably 50-70 hikes approx. 15-20km each), daily to work for 2 years and using them as work boots during tire flip seasons(for 2 seasons). They were pretty much all i wore because of how comfortable they were. In the end they got pretty scuffed and when i got them soaking wet the sides ripped open so i had to order new ones. I've tried the same type and twice as expensive from Icepeak, but they had issues after the second month already(seams tore, glued front opened from expansion in the snow etc.) so i went back to these.

Friendly reminder that if you're buying $$$ fabric boots for /out/ instead of full leather outer, you're getting scammed.
2-5 year durability cycles are NOT normal.
--- 2563083
>>2563079
its a non issue now that hiking boots use 500 mile lifespan eva midsoles and 1000-2000 mile lifespan pu midsoles. if you're fucking the uppers up on hiking boots before the midsole's shot you're fucking up. 
>2-5 year durability cycles are NOT normal.
yeah it is. old school leather midsoled hiking and logging boots last about the same amount of time before needing a resole as rubber/foam midsole boots last. the only difference is you re-used the upper a few times before also discarding it with old boots, while with modern boots the entire boot gets replaced. 
the idea boots are not consumable can only come from one of two places:
- rpg dungeons and diablos dice rolling fantasy elf games
- you fell for all that lumbersexual mens americana revival fashion marketing back in 2015 and still haven't realized it
footwear has always been a consumable especially to travelers of long distances. if you've ever felt like its not its because you don't walk enough.
--- 2563086

keen &amp; merell sell boots similar to that if you want something to compare to

Keens all have waterproof membranes. What about Merrell's? Its say "waterproof" on all boots but few mention membranes ... What's the deal here?

>merell moab ventilators
boot? how on earth do you justify calling that a boot?
--- 2563131
>>2563128
the mid not the low there's two versions.
they're technically a mid but just about every modern hiking boot doesn't go up high enough to offer any more ankle support than it anyways.
--- 2563138
>>2563122
most boots have membranes because 99.95% of people wear runners, shoes, or moab ventilator mids at most when its hot out. boots and the kind of weather that's for are kind of counter intuitive with one another.
i'm not saying don't do it or anything, just explaining why most boots only come with a membrane.
are you trying to find a WATERPROOF boot with no membrane? that's a lot harder.
if not, just buy a non waterproof ventilated boot. salomon, merell etc. get a pair of goretex socks with them to extend their usage. done and done. 
>What about Merrell's? Its say "waterproof" on all boots but few mention membranes 
they sell all their boots with or without the membrane

--- 2563149

I see. Still I'd just use my trailrunners or regular cheap running shoes instead of something like this.

>Boot will be used largely in summer for casual hiking, section hiking long distance trails, forest, daily all-day wear in hot weather.
I want to replace my Quest 4Ds. I'm looking for something like the Salmon Quest 4D without the membrane and a healthier flatter (flatter feeling) insole/midsole. Quest 4D gave me issues with my upper tendons and the joints of my toes. It would also be great to have a non-slipping outsole.

Quest 4D Pros:
- Boot height is perfect (I don't need the ankle support, just the height)
- Runnable
- Weight is just right
- Keeps dirt, sticks, and water out to an acceptable degree for a 2-season boot.

Quest 4D Cons:
- Sweat and Stink. Becomes unusable after 5 days of hiking and bivouacing in summer. Feet constantly wet from sweat. Change socks 3 to 5 times a day. Fungal smell etc.
- Midsole isn't flat enough for a healthy fit. There are bumps on the midsole/insole you can feel inside the boot. If I ever want an orthopedic fit I'll do it myself with a custom insole.
- Issues with upper foot tendons and toe joints 
- Sole is slipping on wet ground
- Too expensive

I think its just marketing, reddit philosophy, and fashion.

I only accept goretex boots in autumn/winter: November to March. 
From April-October I'm using full leather boots or cheap running shoes. I'm looking for something in-between without membrane.

>are you trying to find a WATERPROOF boot with no membrane? that's a lot harder.
No, I already have full leather boots. I just want something smaller looking, more casual for hiking in more civilized areas and trails. "waterproof" does not matter.

>>2563325
>I need the height for protection against vegetation.
you're creating a problem that doesn't exist again, that's why nobody makes a boot for you
google image search 'hiking gaiters'
as i said earlier there's no real functional difference between the mid height and the low cut of modern hiking boots like the example you posted. neither one supports or protects your ankle, both designs are too low cut to offer any profection. the mid cut is more gaiter compatible and my current hiking boots are the exact same shape as these >>2563373 and still require gaiters to keep vegitation out. the only tangible benefit from the inch of height is slightly better load bearing with heavy packs on hills. if you want an aesthetic or look that's fine but you're just going to make your life harder. 
but yeah if mid ventilators don't do it for you just look at salomon's non membrane boots. they have the cut you want.
--- 2563443
>>2563437
Its not about keeping vegetation out. I use my pants for that. Its about not scuffing my ankles on dead wood, logs, branches, brambles, maybe rocks sometimes.
I usually wear high leather boots for that but found the height of the salmon quest 4d is perfect to protect the ankle off trail.

I got a pair of 6 in Red Wing King Toe boots, and they are simply the best modern boot. I got them with a soft toe, which I recommend getting, unless you really need the protection.

You can get them cleaned and conditioned as much as you want.
For those who have bought 100% leather boots, do you recommend Red Wings, or should I order online from some boutique manufacturer? I'm kind of hesitant because I just send them my size, and they send me the boots; I don't get to try them on.

No. I am not talking about who you buy boots from. I'm talking about a particular segment of a market. Boutique is a term used to refer to businesses that deal with discerning customers who have a willingness to pay higher prices for a better quality product and often times a more personalized experience. In the world of finance, for instance, a boutique asset management firm will feature quality advisors, a separately managed account, the option to pick your investments (including ethical investing), and high levels of customer access. In boots, boutique means the option to choose chrome tanned vs. veg tanned leather, species, color, tread, speed hooks vs. eyelets, etc.

personal preference, but where you live and the climate affect the balance of that decision. namely runners would be favored if you live in a high rainfall area.

I'm looking for a pair of boots that is good for the pnw, I want something pretty durable and with good support for when I'm carrying a decent amount of gear. I had considered going with nicks or whites or one of the other pnw legacy brands but they seem to mostly have absurdly large heel drops. I'm not looking for much in the way of insulation, as in the colder months I plan to wear thicker/warmer socks, and I plan to get a separate pair of boots for the actual winter unless I find that I'm comfortable with the warmer socks in my main boot. 

The #1 feature I've grown to hate on boots is hooks for lacing. I would really appreciate finding a pair that doesn't have them, as I've had multiple times in various jobs and while out camping where they've gotten bent or fucked up in some sort of way and as you bend them back they just get shittier and weaker.

I do like some of the lowa offerings, I just wish that gore tex wasn't such a huge part of the lineup. Hanwag only has hooks from what I see so they're out, same with crispi. 

Yeah a cobbler can replace hooks I suppose I could just bring them to a cobbler to have them replaced with loops before I use them, frankly just seems like a waste.

I don't love gore Tex because it never works as well as I'd hope and just holds moisture in my boot, but it kinda looks like I'll just have to accept that it's gonna be a feature that's on any boot I get.

I take them all on an outside pursuit at least once a week because. Sometimes on their own, usually all three together. 
On Sunday it was me and all three and a load of older gearfags stopped us to warn us about "mud up ahead" a bearded grown man with dog that had "turned back because it was so bad".

never worn but I seen then in Sports Direct. Definitely a boot mid and outsole, not my preference but otherwise light and not terrible construction, the stitching will fall apart though because I had terrex shoes of that era and the stitching was the first part to go.

Anyone here with normal heels and midfeet but super wide balls and toes? The Meindl Dovre wide are the only shoes that don't put constant pressure on my pinky but they're heavy, pretty stuffy in warmer months and the membrane takes ages to dry.

--- 2571132
>>2562899
Late response, but I got a pair earlier this year and thought they were cheaply made, the glue looked like it was barely holding the thing together. And they just felt off, like they were stiff for being made of plastic and disposable construction rather than being stiff because they could last a long time. I returned them after wearing them around the yard for a few days.
--- 2571193
>>2571024
Can't make a fair comparison due to not having the Vibrams, but so far (4-6 months) the WHITINs have been holding up very well; though admittedly I'm not on rough terrain often so I'll let you be the judge here.

I'm the anon from >>2561248 and can confirm these are more comfy (for me) with softer insoles. Is your problem just the toebox or is it also the weird lump in the middle of the boot?
--- 2571877
>>2571849
It feels like I stood on concrete barefoot for hours after I wear these for even one hour. I’ll take your advice and get try some new insoles
--- 2571884
>>2571877
Get some insoles that have more cushioning under the heel. 
I have worn the Keen Targhee myself to test them. They are pretty well cushioned as it is. Its most likely that your feet are still too soft. Hike for another year and always give your feet time to recover fully before straining them again.
--- 2571907
>>2571884
NTA but my problem is pic related rather than cushioning. They've got this bump in the middle of the boot that's slightly too far forward and digs into the middle of my foot just before the ball, which feels fine walking around but becomes painful after a few km. Softer insoles deform around the bump and make it flatter.
--- 2572229
Does anyone else have my problem of having feet shaped like water skis? since I have a long and narrow foot I have to wear woman sizes( I'm a dude). But not a lot of woman boots are made in womans 12.

Took them on a 10 mile to break them in and the side is already flopped off. SHIT quality.

>>2571907
That's a serious problem that can cause plantar fasciitis. I had that in Jack Wolfskin hiking boots/shoes. I don't think you can do much in that case. Stop wearing those shoes.
The bumpy insole thing is common with all flexible lightweight boots that have their midsole and sole sprayed on a plastic/TPU grate frame rather than glued to the bottom of a flat one-piece insole (Brandsole). 
Unfortunately most lightweight shoes and boots are made like this including Salomon Quest, Lowa Renegade, Merrell etc. 
Lowa Explorer is the only lightweight boot I can think of that won't have any bumps due to construction.

i don't need anything for trails or jobsites just the most comfortable durable walking shoe i can walk all day in.
--- 2572731
>>2572727
Running shoes are your best bet for walking on concrete all day, half size bigger. asics, nike, puma, whatever you like.

If you want something more durable you will have to sacrifice comfort initially. I don't bother stepping up from running shoes to walking/hiking shoes or lightweight boots for all day use because I would have to buy new ones three or four times a year. I'll wear the running shoes one or two hours each day and durable stitched boots (redwing, hanwag) for the rest of the day. The comfort that sets in when you have four or five hundred miles on them is something you can't get anywhere else.

I have those exact boots and I can say they're ok. They fit very wide, a bout true to size, maybe slightly bigger because of the width. I ordered the Razorbacks recently and I'm waiting to compare them to the Rangers.
I wear an 8.5 in Oboz Sawtooth II and the 8.5 in the rangers is probably a cm more room in the heel length wise. The other problem is that when you crouch, the tops are a bit slim and they can compress across the top of the foot and toes. 7.5/10 Not bad, not my first choice but they are decent, had to replace insoles.

I used to wear these every day but ghw do you deal with the durability? I had to buy three new pairs every year. At 400 to 600 miles they just go to shit. 

Then I started wearing more durable glued boots, much more cost effective but they wear out your joints on concrete...

Now I'm looking at EVA and air cushioned stitched leather boots. They seem to last 4 to 6 times as long as Quest4Ds and don't grind down your knees as badly as PU-glued boots.

Ive worn them a few days at work now, I can feel them starting to break in and they are becoming very comfortable. My primary issue is that the right one looks kinda like a penis with the way the leather is stretched over the composite toe. My coworkers have noticed and started calling them "cockclogs."

Depends on your area and terrain. Where I live has some gnarly small cacti that can go through the sole of your boot and even pop car tires if it hits just right, so I wear heavier boots with thicker soles, but there's no reason for them if these cacti aren't a concern. OP, you should have asked for people's region or climate, and what they do /out/ (working, hiking, camping, climbing, etc) for better answers. But a decent boot will do everything you need in at least 80% of situations, so maybe it doesn't really matter much. Probably anything will be fine unless you're doing something extreme, or in an extreme environment. In which case, hopefully you have the knowledge and experience to solve this problem by yourself.

You might look for local outdoors groups or hobby groups for more specific answers for your intentions

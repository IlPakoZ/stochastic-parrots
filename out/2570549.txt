Anyone know anything about Mobiflex Shelter Systems? One has come up for sale in my area but I can't find a lot of information about them. Them seem to have a design flaw where some plastic internal pegs in them don't hold up but are otherwise considered good. Anyone know what happened to them?

It predates it. Also, the one I am looking at buying is military 'Command Post' version.

Here's one of the few items I can find on it. Still haven't fond a manual.

This looks like something old people would buy for their grandkids to play with in the yard.

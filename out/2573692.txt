I am sorry your life was so short
I am sorry the lighting was so bad that this was the best photo i could take
I am sorry i bought you at 6 PM today and that you were dead by 10:30 PM
I am sorry that no one noticed you were sick before i bought you
I am sorry that you didn't get 7 months of life frocking in the woods of Maine before Muslims or Jamaicans ate you
I am sorry that your 25 brothers and sisters might have whatever respiratory infection killed you and i am worried about them
I knew you for less than five hours but i miss you
I will try to remember you by making gloves out of your skin and putting a big enough pile of rocks on top of you so that the crows and coyotes don't touch you
I will never forget you, i wasn't there soon enough to give the half year of fun in the woods you deserved from life.

I'm sorry.

Who would do such a thing, and why? Do you have trail cams set up on your property? Condolences

I have been buying goats from this guy who is a major county livestock dealer for 4 years. I buy them, raise them for half a year then sell them at auction. Normally he is a upfront and respectable dealer. 

This year they are half starved, diseased and his idea of transferring them to my trailer is grabbing them by the neck and throwing them into it. The only reason i went through with the deal was i didn't want to leave them in his hands because they are obviously abused. He also obviously lied about their age as half haven't been weened. I expect to lose half simply because they are diseased, starved and too young. I only took them because he would hurt them more if i didn't. 

As soon as i am done saving as many as possible i am going to raise holy hell and ruin this assholes life.

The goat does not care, it is dead.

This is a very weird thing to post on 4chan.

Goat meat is a delicacy, idk who the Muslims or Jamaicans are in your area but they eat goats because that is just normal.

I just read the whole story.

Hmm I bet he wanted to sell the sick goat to still make money, but that is not honest.

If he was reliable before, you can confront him about it like an adult and not just escalate it immediately, to work things out, or take your business elsewhere.

People don't like being swindled, and if you swindle someone you will drive away business.

That is seriously fucked up. My farm breeds and raises goats, and I would never treat them like that. I love these fucking guys. We've got nine 4-week old babies right now and hanging out with them is a great source of stress relief. They're like puppies.

What county? And what do you mean muslims and jamaicans? Our only major immigrant group is the somali colony of lewiston.

Sad, I hope you sort things out, he shouldn't get to work with goats if the doesn't treat them right

Good man, anon.
I'm sorry about your goats. More than that I'm sorry for your goats. 
They're a dignified animal and they deserved better, thank you for laying them to rest with that dignity intact.
Do all you can do shut that piece of shit down.

I'm sorry for ur loss. I don't know what state you live in or country but that guy needs to go. Either through legal means or by other means. Preferably juridically by dispossessing him of any current and future contact with animals

Never ever bring sick livestock onto your farm. That's like rule number 1 of keeping livestock. There are a good number of goat diseases that you're going to be dealing with for years after the last dead goat is gone. Do you want that in your life? For what? Because some livestock flipper was being unethical so instead of HIM dealing with the consequences of his shitty practices YOU can deal with them and he gets off with cash on his pocket?

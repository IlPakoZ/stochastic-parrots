i mean I have to credit him at least a bit
the oldest natural protection zones here in Germany are from the NS time
in principle the law was well written, in fact that well that we still have most of the wording in our laws today

but the NS regime was corrupt and Hitler a complete nutjob
the law was probably well indented but they and their big conglomerate friends broke it almost immediately

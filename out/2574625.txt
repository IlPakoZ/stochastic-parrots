Best snow goggles?

Best sub-zero clothing?

>hammering out a V piton
>super wiggly but not coming out, so I hold it with one hand while "dehammering" with the other
>strike my thumb, recoil in shock and strike my forehead with the pointy end of the hammer
>didnt bring my first aid kit because its only 300m with abseils
>bleed all over my new shirt and rope
>didn't even manage to get the piton out

Always happy to see one of these threads pop up. Here’s some Alaskan alpine climbing from late summer last year. Super wet, loose, sketchy, but wildly fun. Bummed the whole climb was socked in past 4000 ft so there wasn’t really a view on the summit, but it definitely makes it less heady when you can’t see how exposed you are. Excited to be heading back up there soon.

Looks like a sick climb

I want to get into alpine climbing. I’ve skied since I was 6 but I’ve never gotten into other alpine sports. How expensive is it?

Depends, really. You’ll need all the normal climbing safety gear, the cold weather gear you probably already have, some extra bivouac/camping stuff and obviously some picks and other pointy implements

Fuck cold, invest in Eastern Dolomites desu

Pic from last year. Approaching the summit of Mt. Shasta. Excited to get on some more volcanos this season. Adams, Rainier, and maybe Hood via Cooper Spur. Developing my multi-pitch trad skillset to hopefully get on some Wyoming alpine rock routes as well.

I have 60 year old crampons and short shorts, and sun screen.

Awesome pic, that summit plateau on Shasta is better than the actual summit in terms of relief you feel

Mount Whitney via MR route in early March 2023 at Lower Boy Scout Lake. Was on snowshoes and had the mountain to ourselves but literally double or triple the snow I expected for a normal Whitney year, snowshoes needed all the way down to 6400ft.

I’ve just been doing some backcountry snowboarding and a high country solo for anything considered an alpine day lately. Snowshoe up gulley, bomb down and wish for more. I’m pretty excited for this summers alpine plans. Maybe Yosemite to start, sawtooths, grand Tetons and finally Whitney. It’ll be a hoot!

Sweet. I’ve got a permit for sept 15-19 or so and I’d like to hit the east face and east arete. Hopefully it’s not terribly snowy. Do you think that’s feasible or should we concentrate on one route?

September is the best month for Whitney and the Sierras historically because while it isn't the warmest it is the longest insolation (solar exposure) period before the new winter snow hits but the previous winters snow has had 9 years to melt. Ice sticks around all year sometimes, so yaktraks are a good choice and really light

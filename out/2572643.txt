I wear these.
Cosy fit for my thighs, arse and bollocks. Natural material that's comfortable and thick enough to go for a wild swim in. 
The bright white means I can closely monitor the stains at the end of each hike. Check if I've blown my ringhole out or got some sort of discharge.
The benefits are obvious.

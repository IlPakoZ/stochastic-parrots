Do the benefits of nordic walking poles outweight the disadvantages of looking like a fag/senior citizen?

Here's a hiking pro tip: In the woods, there are sticks everywhere. They are literally lying on the ground.

You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You don’t have a plan (probably the most important). You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.

if you're too concious about nordic walking poles then wait for people to find out you use 4chan
i don't use them (maybe yet) but come on, do you go /out/ constantly thinking
>holy shit if someone sees me like this then they will laugh
or do you want to enjoy nature? you go /out/ to literally not give a fuck about people, we all do. so continue, carry on doing what you want as long as you're not littering or burning down the entire forest.
>>2561416
if it's too cold or you are building something then yes, otherwise you can as well use a fucking hazmat suit when /out/, same separation from nature, faggot. if you want to see nature and not touch it then keep on watching tv.

Honestly I‘ve never even had that thought cross my mind until I saw it here. If people see me im on a trail and im carrying a tent and walking faster than 95% of the other hikers. If they judge me they‘ll probably think im obnoxiously try-harding rather than gay and old.

Anyone can get deep splinters and possible complications from them. Imagine dealing with this shit because you were afraid that someone might think you're a fag

--- 2562265
>>2562232
nothing makes your ankles weak permanently like repeatedly rolling them with full body weight+ like you would without walking poles. 
Just do strengthening exercises and protect yourself with the poles and you'll be good

I do like feeling unencumbered for parts of some hikes, but using them especially when the terrain is more difficult just massively increases my endurance. Plus having 3 points of contact at all times on more treacherous sections of trail is enormously helpful. Who are you trying to look cool for in the woods anyways?
--- 2562565

Idk just don't pick up a splintery stick it's not that hard
--- 2562578

Get fucked you authoritarian freak who insists that everyone else must do things his way or not at all. You're exactly the type of person I go /out/ to get away from.

Or just buy a better one and have it for life. It's not that expensive.
--- 2563834
>>2561390 (OP)

Bought some for helping me get through some ankle issues. Got through the issues with them and I'd never go back. Crossing rivers is way better, checking that you're about to stand on solid ground is awesome when you're in terrain that can have all sorts of holes and crumbly soft stuff. Pointing at stuff with your poles is awesome. Slippery ground, going down hill, going up hill. I use them help prop up my tarp when I make camp. The benefits go on and on and on, why the hell do we walk on two legs its shit. 

Only downside is carrying a rifle with them isn't all that great.
--- 2563860
>>2561390 (OP)
Yes. For some people they mught not outweigh the drawbacks, but this isn't a situation where form should rival function

there are entire biomes without a single tree.
--- 2564598
>>2562565
there is no excuse other than poorfaggotry or laziness to not either buy a good stick (which comes with a lot of upsides like lighter weight and collapsibility so you can climb with them) or at least select a good stick out in the woods, bring it home, give it some finishing and keep it.
--- 2564599
in what retard's world does it make sense to spend a half hour finding a decent stick every time i go hiking? why would i not just buy a stick at that point? i go hiking all the time. that adds up to a lot of wasted time i could be on the trail. sticks also don't exist in half of my state.
--- 2565011
>>2561390 (OP)
So what's the point of walking poles at all other than for checking snow depth? Genuinely curious, I find them to be a hinderance in rough terrain and in particular thick bush. Maybe I'm just using them incorrectly and have yet to see the light.
--- 2565038
>>2565011
They're good for balance and stability when crossing streams and descending slopes down to waterfall bases. They take pressure off your knees on steep descents and are also useful on inclines. They help you look out for rattlers when you're hiking through grassy or bushy areas. And some people use them as poles for makeshift, lightweight shelters.
--- 2567423
>>2561390 (OP)
Poles are poles. Use them when overloaded to save your back. 

Staves are for the poor. They're much more versatile.

I went traipsing around uninhabited private land once. So hilly I had to cut a sapling for a staff to get back out. 

Still have the staff.
--- 2567455
>>2561390 (OP)
Hiking pole tents have turned poles into net 0 downside gear addition.
You can even have a base setup. Using a single pole tent at camp, and taking the spare for walkabouts.

--- 2569349

I don't know. I think there's a separate activity that's like power walking with some kind of pole that it refers to but I've only ever seen them called trekking poles.
--- 2569368
>>2569307
No one uses the term “Nordic walking stick” in the US. We call them trekking poles. It’s either a newfag calling them Nordic or something they say in Australia.
--- 2569375
>>2567478
Nta but building credit is absolutely necessary to be successful in the US and because banks suck ass the more debt you have that’s consistently paid means more money can be borrowed. Borrowing money to buy shit is a great financial move when you already have the money for it anyway.

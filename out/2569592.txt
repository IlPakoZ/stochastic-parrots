Hello all,

Would anyone know if the American Legion/AMvets etc has any travel related benefits like campgrounds/hookups/showers for those who are traveling around the states in a small camper?

Thanks,

/out/ isn't old enough to have any vets. It's mostly 16-20 year old zoomers that live with their parents and can't hold down a job.

There's a a few vets here, but we don't feel like we need handouts just to go /out

I was in the navy for 6 years and I will bend over backwards to avoid talking about my time in the service, letting people know I'm a veteran, and just avoiding other veterans in general.

Speak for yourself. I get my fishing and hunting license for free and I have a pass for day use in my state parks. The one thing the army taught me is how to play the beauracracy. 

Now am I going to pay dues to join some vet organization for free campsites nah. But I'm gonna take my gibs. Sadly, gibs vary by state. I think there's a reduced rate national parks pass too, but it's sort of a pain and national forests are free.

Vets have free lifetime access to national parks now. In my state also state park, but most of my visits to state parks are to hunt and I use access that don't have no gates anyway so it's not much of a Benny. you can go apply for your national park pass right now vet anons.

You don't need free shit to go /out, you're just taking handouts. You're only slightly better than a welfare queen.

Every military base has lodging that you can use as a Veteran. There are also camping areas at most bases as well .Check out Military.com and search lodging or camping. I use them quite often . If you served, you earned this privilege.Use it.

These are earned benefits. Not free handouts.

I'm a full on welfare queen. And I would never deny it.

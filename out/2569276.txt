Anybody recommend this watch? Was wondering if it was worth the sale price.
--- 2569292
I have the Instinct Crossover Solar and it's pretty legit. Basically the same as the Instinct 2, but with analog hands which glow in the dark. 
I got it to have a (potentially) infinite battery life GPS and ABC, but have ended up using way more of the features I was initially skeptical about. 

It's G-shock vibes and aesthetics but with more modern functionality.

Just buy the Fenix 7X Solar or the Solar Sapphire, instead of sounding like lame herbs, you poorfags.

Dont fall for the apple like name branding Garmin pushes, instead invest in Amazfit T Rex 2 and get the same at a better price

Great watch, look at the features available of it and others and make your decision from there. The quality is there and the features work as described.
>>2569384
Yeah I type all of this with a Fenix 7 on my wrist.

typing this with a Solar Tactical 2, amazing watch. 30 day battery life when you disable the useless pulse Ox mode. great watch.

complete waste of money
--- 2570252
>>2570245
for most people, yeah
--- 2570255
Can anybody recommend a good /out/ watch for under 200 bucks?
Bonus points for heart rate monitor and non-meme compass.
--- 2570256
protip - most (US) insurance plans have a discount for garmin devices. depending on your plan it might be better than garmin sale prices.
--- 2570267
Another tracking device, all I needed.
Thanks jews!
--- 2570310
>>2570267
Yeah that watch that has no telecoms on it sure is scary.
--- 2570316
>>2570310
>smartwatch
>sends and receives signals
>quite literally has gps tracking
I bet you think turning off the location on your phone means the government can't find you
--- 2570332
>>2570316
GPS is one way. If it has bluetooth to your phone you can just turn it off. At least understand the things you are afraid of.
--- 2570337
>>2570332
This man is trolling
--- 2570360
>>2570332
good bait, but you have to try harder.
--- 2570367
My brother gave me his old garmin watch, no manual, and I cant really seem to find the point of it.
It doesnt display a map that I can tell. I dont care what my heart rate is, or how far I've gone, so what do I do with this thing?

It's like you don't even dive bruh

Just because you are too stupid to understand something doesn't make it bait.
--- 2570431
>>2570332
Retard yes GPS is receive only, however that doesn't stop tracking internally on the watch, not to mention NFC, radio, wifi, bluetooth and cellphone 2,3,4,5G from sending your exact location real time to (((corp))) (((glowie ABCs))).
Having anything with GPS can and will track you that's a fact. There's no uncompromised chipmakers and receivers unless you use a military GPS which is illegal for lowly peasant civilians to possess.
--- 2570435
>>2570431
Ok so don't pair it to your phone and then it is a GPS with bluetooth connected to nothing. They don't have cellphone antenna, onboard wifi, or NFC. If I understand right your suggestion is that there is a secret phone antenna in the watch that is sending your info to some secret organization while still having a 30 day battery life? Or do you have no point and are just going to schizo out a little bit longer?

Stay away OP, it steals your DNA code and is just (another) way for NATO to spy on you.
--- 2570442
>>2570435
I know your pozzed to fucked but ill bite. The watch itself has a transmitter even when in "airplane" mode. There have been tests in Faraday cages these devices transmit even when turned off/set to airplane mode with unknown yet not emi induced frequencies.
They litterally mine this data 24/7 it also how they make money.
--- 2570452
>>2570442
This anon is right. They are reading your thoughts with the device and using it to train their AGI
--- 2570454
>>2570442
Link to these tests? Never heard of this before.
--- 2570461
>>2570442
Where can I read about these tests you speak of? I'm not finding anything.

And the voices keep saying mean things even when you wear the tinfoil hat.

Funny I work in Navy Intel I know what they are capable of. That's why I don't use GPS devices EVER!, I don't even use a dumb cellphone because you can still get triangulated! All that NFC, QR codes bluetooth is designed to track you 200% AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN TO ME. I will never let the glowies spy on me or track me!
I live a healthier tech feel lifestyle and I'm happy because of it.

Who's wearing the tinfoil hat now Civie?

just get a miband 7 from aliexpress if you want a cheap functional smartwatch
--- 2570479

Well my dad owns Garmin and he says they are good to go so ball's in your court, boot.

Then you are a fucking glowie whether you realize it or not retard. You are apart of it as anyone else is.

From my experience with people in the military you are a brain dead retard that hardly passed high school. Why should I trust you?

--- 2570780

You do realize that QR codes can easily track you if you scan them. They are geotagged to a particular position.

my amazfit sucks major ass. Automatic tracking never works for actual workouts, instead it likes to register walks to the mailbox and analyse them instead (I'm doing well on those though), when I want to track my bike rides half the time it stops for whatever reason and you cant use any of the other functions during tracking.

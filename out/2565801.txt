Everyone forgets about River Monsters.

A fishing show so good it ran out of content.
--- 2565888
In one episode Ray Mears catches a fish with his bare hands. Then he lights a fire with his bare hands. Then he cooks the fish and offers a piece to his cameraman, whose presence he acknowledges. Can you be any more based?

I am watching dual survivor's 

it is sort of unrealistic how those guys sleep on the ground always like it was nothing, it is just obvious that they don't sleep in their "camps" they just go back home and film another day

One thing I liked about the dual survivors is that the hunter actualy can get food from the woods, dude kill big animals no problem, he nows how to, hit, to shot, to set traps and how to butcher animals 

this is the most important part of all camping, food, without it you can't survive no matter what
--- 2566416
>>2566414

this bulshit talk about eat ze bugs is retarded af 

if you're not eating properly you aren't able to survive that's why I liked the show so much

Not a fed and is uncancellable somehow. He replied to a thread last week about one of his recent vids and called someone a nigger for seething at him. Power level is too high

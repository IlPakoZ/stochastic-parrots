I need to uo my food game, I went for my first hike where I slept outside last week and my food was a bit shit, so tell me what are the best options.
--- 2564506
Ice cream back at camp is amazing
--- 2564509
>>2564503 (OP)
my idea:

--2 categories: main food, snacks

MAIN FOOD

-bread dough to cook
-butter (best for cold weather)
-canned meat
-canned condensed milk
-canned tuna
-canned tomatoes 
-canned fruit
-powdered coffee
-dry biscuits
-dried meat (expensive af)
-pemmican
-electrolytes to put in water 

SNACKS

-protein bars
-crackers (wasa, Ritz, tuc, normal crackers etc)
--- 2564512
>>2564509
also cereal bars for snacks 

post infographics if you got them

I just eat like summer sausage and cheese, maybe some triscuits.
Vienna Sausages are another staple, basically all sorts of bar shaped foods.
If I bring a little stove I'll also bring like a can of beanee weenees or some spam or something.

"Camping" foods like freeze dried stuff or MRE's are too expensive.

either you're bringing camping food or glamping food. just pick one. either eat tasty shit if you're doing a short trip in the woods or actually read the nutrition label and learn what the things on it mean if you're spending extended time in the backcountry.

Look at the canned foods aisle of your local supermarket and decide from there. I usually bring canned tuna, salmon and chicken, instant rice or noodles (something I can cook fully with less than ideal fire on a camping pot), maybe canned chickpeas or legumes, and canned vegetables. I also bring fresh fruit, I don't bother with fresh vegetables unless I'm in a very short (sub 3 days) expedition. I usually bring my air rifle while /out/ so I can compliment my food with doves and quails I find. For snacks I to bring like nuts, dried bananas, some chocolate candy, and crackers, but usually I'm not snacking much while out, exercising cuts my appetite.

Anon, this question is too open ended. What are your goals? How far are you hiking? How long are you staying? 

If your focus is on camping, you have more options. Weight is less of an issue. Short trips allow for food that would otherwise spoil. Longer hikes are tougher, as weight can be a determination factor of comfort. If your focus is on hiking, canned food isn’t a good option.

hiking, id stay out 1 night and 2 days, or 2 nights and 3 days, that the most I can do since I do it in the weekend, I want to bring stuff to keep me fed and not be miserable, and possibly that tastes well, and isnt a pain in the dick to cook, last time I had rice which is annoying to cook since it uses water, and tuna cans, which I don't really like, and cereal bars, indid eat the first night because I was cold as fuck and tired so I went to sleep, btw incoukdnt feel my toes anymore, after I changed my socks wet It was much better, idk the temp but probably was below 0 because my tarp had small ice things above my sleeping bag hole where I was breathing.

anyway the next day my muscles went into exhaustion much faster (idk if that's the true reason but it's what i noticed) bc I didn't eat, plus having shit food lowers morale and makes the experience less pleasant

my rice tasted like plastic because I had to use my bladder water to cook it, and it had fucking pine needles inside
--- 2564857

If it can be avoided, don’t bother cooking with your filtered water. Just use water directly from a stream or creek, if possibly. It’s going to be booked anyway.

I’ve got two homemade meals that are my go to favorites. Neither requires any kind of actual cooking or dehydrating. 

The first is Slurkas beans and rice. It’s super popular, delicious, calorie dense, and nutritionally balanced. It’s instant refried beans, minute rice, taco seasoning, cheese, and Fritos. Google it. Trust me Anon, it’s well worth it.

The second is a simple combination of dry chorizo sausage, minute rice, a bouillon cube, and Italian seasoning. I use 2oz of sausage, 1 cup of rice, 1 small bouillon cube, and 1/4tsp of Italian seasoning. 

Minute rice is an ok option when you can measure everything at home. Just about anything you need to heat up will require water, or will be pretty heavy (which is an issue since your focus is on hiking). Rice dishes use a little less than soups, but are generally less forgiving if you get the water amount wrong (Skurka’s beans and rice is an exception).

>>2564856
The good news is that on shorter trips you can be very flexible as you're not trying to cram a weeks worth of food into your bag. Worry a little less about weight of the food and focus on dietary needs, quality, and ease of cooking.

For long, moderate activity like hiking I tend to lean towards focus on quick and easy complex carbs with a little fat and protein. I have a water tight cooking set up so I will often do cold soak oatmeal for the morning with milk powder or granola and peanut butter. I don't want to heat up anything more than a few oz of water for coffee and get moving faster. During the day I try to avoid an extended lunch break, hiking with a full stomach just makes my afternoon hike slower so bars, fruit snacks, etc. during the day about every 2hrs. Sometimes a tortilla with something (usually the same meat for dinner) if I'm actually stopping.

Dinner is the big one. If you use rice, get the 5min stuff. Instant mash potatoes, pasta sides, etc are popular because they are cheap, flavorful, and cook fast. They are easy to dress up by adding dry spices, a little hot sauce bottle/packets, etc. I will often bring a bag of dry veggies to toss in and sausage of some kind. I also don't cook by boiling in my cook pot, canister stoves kinda suck for that. I have a separate, sealable cook pot that has a reflectix coozie. Boil the water, pour over the rice, stir, seal, wait 10-15min. Saves me fuel and I just busy myself with something else while waiting. Due to duration of your hikes, you can absolutely get away with canned stuff, just make it cans you like. I like fish in a good sauce to go over the rice, or flavored meat spreads. Experiment at home too. Don't neglect a little desert either, candy bars and hot chocolate mix are good morale boosters.
--- 2567096
>>2564856
>>2567084
Also unless temps make it a challenge, don't be afraid to eat fresh. Fruit, hard bread, bagels, cheese, pickles. In cooler weather cream cheese, deli meats, go nuts. On longer hikes I used to get a sandwich and leave off the dressings, then just pick up a couple of the packets of mustard, relish, and mayo. Always consider pack space and weight needs first but especially on a weekender don't be afraid to ball out every once and a while. Even on thru hike stuff you still take the opportunity to eat good and different when you can, no reason to make it suck if it doesn't have to.

No reason to slog them thru the rest of the reservation. Besides, got cousins and nephews and nieces that handily filled the site to capacity after we left.

That's it bro. Can even run a line while you do other stuff. Can bring some veggies for vitamins and perhaps some carbs. Tortillas for fish tacos are not a bad idea. Dry milk powder is good for cereal. Of course if you can track, trap/shoot, and butcher your own game, you can eat like a king while camping. Securing meat and water means securing your indefinite survival, being a very energy dense food that can be cooked to be even more nutritious.
--- 2573132
>>2573128
Fish trapping and survival fishing is a great way to passively secure food from the wilderness while focused on other tasks like setting up shelter and a fire. When you reach a point that your basic needs are secured, you are really left to your own devices. To write or prepare for a hunt, to play music from an instrument or distill traditional corn wash moonshine, to tend to your guerilla crops or to make sweaty love with a woman bent over against a tree. You know, normal camping activities.
--- 2573746
>>2573132
Never tried fish trapping but tried to fish with a fly fishing rod, can't say i have ever gotten a bite. How do i know what bait to use depending on species? We have perch and pike here depending on the time of the year
--- 2573767
>>2573746

You have a lot of options for fish trapping, you can just set a line and a hook with bait really to passively catch individual fish, or use a slat or basket trap that can be bought or made from local materials. Here is a basic trotline, it's just multiple fishing lines on one line, so you can haul in multiple fish overnight or even quicker.

We have perch down here, worms are good bait you can find locally, minnows, whatever you would usually use. I think the word trotline comes from trout line, so it's not limited to catfish or any one type of fish. If you can find a stream with fish, like you would do fly fishing in, you can use basket traps or even catch one in the palm of your hand with some bait in your palm against the water. Of course you can make a fishing spear as well, and you can spit roast the fish over a fire or process and grill the fillets.
--- 2573768
>>2573767


My bad, here's the diagram.

You just need a means for the line to float, you may not need a weight. Empty jugs or shorelines are good for this, just clean up everything after you are done.

Are you aware that those fire rings are intended to contain the fire, and therefor prevent accidents that cause severe damage to the local ecology? Next time, don't overload the fire, and don't burn deadfall, as that is naturally decomposing biomass that needs to stay on the ground in order for a proper nutrient cycle to occur.

not gonna go as far as saying not to burn deadfall, OP is a complete oxygen thief no doubht, but burning some brances, yea, logs like in his negative IQ log fire? yea thats ... something else

Have you never seen a bulldozer clear and acre of land, shove it next to the bordering forest, then burned? Protip, the forest doesn't magically ignite!

According to the majority of FMPs that Ive had to read for work, deadfall burning is a major issue in parks like the one he is probably visiting (cleared, flattened campsite with a forest ring) mind you I do understand that it is a destroyed environment by it's very nature, as massive areas with cut out roads and campsites aren't natural but it would be nice if we could keep it as close to as natural as possible while still allowing people to visit it. Unfortunately it is often an uphill battle as the majority of parks simply cannot maintain that level of conservation.

It doesn't matter that he's burning wood, it matters where he is getting it from, wood cut for firewood is taken from woodlots that are actively managed and grown for the purpose of being firewood, if everyone took firewood from in and around the same campsites for years and years, the local ecology would be damaged, herbaceous plants would be damaged or killed off, nutrients would be removed from the soil, and the natural order of how stuff works would be destroyed.

Or, here's the alternate option that literally is written into every FMP ever, you get up, and go to a free firewood collection site that is clearly marked out specifically for you and everyone else who wants free firewood, and go there.

Forest management plan, its what every government does for literally all the forest in the entire world, well, most modern first world countries. 
In this explanation I'm gonna use the Michigan example but you can apply this to most states. https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/managing-resources/forestry/management/region
So this is a detailed document that is basically made up of every company's management plan for the next 5 - 10yrs. It outlines everything, from where they're gonna cut wood, where they're gonna prep to plant, where they're gonna plant, where they are leaving shit to protect wildlife, etc etc etc. These have been a thing since I think like the 1960s (?) ish roughly, and they're pretty fucking swag cause they are freely available information for literally everyone but no granola crunching hemp wearing bongo bashing hippie knows they exist so they think all forest management is evil companies clearcutting and shit. These documents are like a fucking bible and I don't know how it works for other states but the michigan one is huge because if you fuck up and dont follow the mangement plan you can get into serious trouble.

A part of the FMP, the one that is most significant to you, is free wood collection areas, which are typically located near rural roadsides and are intended for use by the community and are allotted areas where a Forestry Technician (Like me :3) goes there and goes "yeup, this here is good wood" and then alots however much to the community (usually a few acres) and its basically the way to get people to remove stuff from the roadside for whatever reason, like maybe theres potential for bug infestations or disease to grow and fester there and they don't want it, but you don't care and shouldn't care about that, it's free wood
--- 2571181
>>2571173
Ima keep it a buck with you, the reason alot of hippies and shit don't look at FMPs is because 75% of it is intended for government or commercial use as legal documentation so you really gotta dig for info relevant to you. 
My suggestion is look at the table of contents for your region and see if there's a community section. Also keep in mind that your state might not alot firewood collection sites but if they don't do that, go to your local ministry authority and ask if it would be possible for you to go to thrashing piles and collect wood from there, basically all the garbage off the tree like limbs and branches that they cant use at lumber mills get left in the woods in big piles and some places offer the ability to take them for like a fee of liek 20$ for a lifetime license or if you don't live near a logging site, go to a lumber mill and ask if they have a reject pile you can sift through for free firewood (keep only untreated lumber as copper arcenic is not good for your lungs)

Hey, retard, most of the west coast forests have burn bans year round for most of the parks because you idiotic fuck faces can't even keep your dogs off no pet trails so you certainly aren't to be trusted with fire near 1000 year old trees.

Being wasteful is a hallmark of low IQ. I have a low trash footprint because I'm not a retarded consooomer. If we actually cared about the environment we'd take over congo and the amazon to prevent brown people from cutting it all down then we'd nuke china and India for literally shitting up the ocean.

This fire was made with the finest 1000 year old trees.

once i have managed to start a forest fire during midwinter when during a skiing trip i made a camprife under fallen tree and had my meal there, i buried it under half a meter of snow after
next week when i came by the same place again the whole 4x4 meter root wall was burned away during my absence, luckily there was still over 1 meter of snow around

I'm the guy building the fires, and this is on Canada.
Our local firefighters just razed a whole bunch of ground in town, I'm going to grab pictures for this greenie
--- 2572352
>>2572346
yes it was a really big tree next to a logging site thats why the wind felled it and yes we have over 1 meter of snow here
i learned my lesson
--- 2572420
>>2572352
I don't think there's much risk of runaway fires, in the winter, in otherwise healthy forest
--- 2572431
Most of the Western forests have been burned and intensively logged at some point. 
Penny wise and pound foolish to worry about campfires.
You take the shit with the sugar, there are endless areas here in the Sierra that have been improved by wildfire. 
Does anyone doubt that? I have examples.
--- 2572474
>>2572420
no not an actual forest fire i meant the big tree roots went up in flames
it was like pic related and when i came back there was nothing left but the trunk and large areas around were melted and burned
i learned my lesson

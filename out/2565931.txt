Curious, its usually only people whose feet are too weak to wear boots that complain about other peoples choice of footwear.

The only explanation I can come up with is that you are a fag, with faggy feet, and surplus boots you're unable to wear for more than 15 miles.

I try to convince people to neglect ankle support because I secretly want them to end up in the hospital promising themselves never to hike again. Having less people on the trail is always a win.

Pic related is what I see all day everyday during tourist season.

WI, near Devil's Lake State park. 2 million or more tourists annually. Most of them are from Madison, Milwaukee, and Chicago, but thousands of seasonal workers come from all over the world to work in the Wisconsin Dells and they all end up at the park eventually. On the positive side I really enjoy being able to casually talk face to face with people from every continent in a single month. I just wish the Hispanics would leave their stereo backpacks at home. I can always smell the Arabs/Indians before I see them on trails hiking up the bluffs in loafers. Once in a while a hippy chick wearing next to nothing will pass me and I'll look back to ask her how far the trailhead is (I've been hiking there since I was 8 lol)

On the topic of ankle support, people lose their footing out on the bluffs like it's trending on Tik Tok. The local ER gets packed with college kids every summer. Someone dies almost every year. One guy went free climbing alone, fell and broke his spine, sat there fully conscious for 2 days before dying, 100 ft from a common trail. I see people hop up the boulders everday I'm there like "let's see how this ends lmao".

To be fair, even though I live there and know the risk I went boulder clmibing alone a couple of times. The second time I fell and wedged my leg between two boulders and I was like "I can't continue being this stupid".

You don't wear boots for extra support. Only old faggots and women do that.

boots are for the stiff "platform" they provide, cushioning against the ground and against cold wet. If you need ankle support something is wrong with your feet.

Nice. I have stopped going to devil's lake because the amount of tourists is making the parking situation unbearable. The boulders are fun to climb, but only retards try to do the vertical cliffs without gear.
These days the closest I get there is dove hunting in the field before the turn by the apple orchard. I'm pretty sure out of towners aren't used to it and it spooks the hell out of them.

You could also secure your ankles by strengthening them, but I'm sure you'd rather drop $200 on boots you're never going to take on anything more than a clearly marked and well established trail

*gasp!* I'm shocked one of the biggest /out/ tourist attractions near the biggest tourist destination in the state would be crawling with tourists!

you can own different footwear for different tasks autists
in fact, you should own multiple grades of wear

Why isn't it working?
It still burns just very slowly, I was expecting flames coming up the side of my pot
Yes there are more holes along the bottom

Not enough ventilation. If you want something not ventilated like that, you're going to have to force fuel through it.

So more holes at the top?

Fire needs oxygen to burn. As air comes in, the oxygen in it feeds the fire, and what's left gets heated and rises out because hot air rises. The fire can't draw in more cold, oxygen-rich air until the hot, oxygen-poor air is gone.

A grate across the top creating an air gap between the fire barrel and the pot would be better than more holes.

Smoke out the bottom is a clear sign it's not drafting properly, so yes bigger holes at the top.

Use the can opener side of a bottle opener to punch triangles instead of a knife to make slits. Also face the bottom opening into the wind if there is any blowing to force feed the fire.

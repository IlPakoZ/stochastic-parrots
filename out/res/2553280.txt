only one week left in winter
Did you go /out/doors this season, or did you only stay /in/doors and consume youtuber vlogs like a fat larper?
The snowpack here has reached record levels. I'll be snowshoeing in June. Must be lame to live in an overly urbanized shithole where there's only one week of winter left.
It sucks to suck.
bringing a gun up a mountain
retard
Of course I went outside, and it hasn't snowed here a single time in the past 15 years.
Did you go /out/doors this season
ofc
or did you only stay /in/doors and consume youtuber vlogs like a fat larper?
Careful you'll upset the u/k/raine newfags
I don't think Rin appreciates you pointing the gun in her direction
he doesnt have a summit gun
Sad!
anime is enjoyed by people who have shitty personalities
It's kind of cringe that OP brought a deringer while you brought an actual gun.
have you forgotten where you are?
What gat be that
Poorus TX22
is that berthoud?
my job is outside and wintery
that image is so fucking
old 4chan is top 500 and regularly dips into top 50
Reddlt spacing
Triggered by a picture of a firearm
post tits
makes fun of OP for bringing a 22
praises anon for bringing a 22
lmao
You can cope all you want, but a deringer is a woman's gun. And spoilers: you will never be a woman.
sir, this is an /out/doors board
>/pol/ is that way
You're still stuck here >>2558203
Just spent a week skiing innawoods and slept a night in a snow ditch in below -30°C degrees. Had to cover my face with a scarf since all the moisture from my breath crystallized around the sleeping bag's breathing hole and then rained on my face every time i rolled around.
The next night was almost as cold and quite a lot more windy but a bit more sheltered.
it can be a mans gun but only if it's chambered in 45-70 govt
That's fucking neat, anon
Have a (you), bearfucker
The view was also nice. There was an avalanche incident on the very same area just a couple of hours ago, apparently nobody died but still a good reminder that it can be dangerous to mess around the backcountry this time a year.
is this scandinavia?
Those treeless mountains look too flat to be north america unless you're someplace weird like labrador or quebec
North-East Finland.
getting into ski-touring. liking it alot sofar. we had very little snow this year unfortunately.
i started split boarding this winter, probably my number 1 favourite activity already. it’s all i want to do ever since the first time i went out. going to rogers pass this week
how do you even get started anon? I really want to but equipment costs are too much for me to jump right in blind
inb4 ask the shop
unfortunately shops around here are full of weekend warrior resort skiiers only
If you have to ask then you aren't ready.
well i learned skiing as a kid and i go hiking and rock climbing in the alps so i just put 2 and 2 together. it's incredibly popular here in switzerland so finding a group was a breeze. i already had the hardshell gear from iceclimbing and bought the ski's and boots used. got the avalanch search thing for free from a coworker who didn't use it. 
maybe you can get something cheap when a local shop replaces its rental material? i got my ice tools for virtually free like this. they aren't the best but get the job done. or just rent the stuff the first couple of times and buy stuff over time when its on sale. pay attention when you buy a used dynafit binding, they loose tension with age. keep in mind that you'll ruin your first pair of skis rather quickly so it's not really worth it buying the newest and bestest as you first set
Sometimes I bring two, and I'm not even joking.
My only regret is not making it down to Utah for a ski trip. Then again, it seems like the crowds have gotten so bad that it might not be worth it anymore.
Said the guy who's too much of a pussy to go anywhere without his steel pacifier
pathetic female attempt at emasculation 
Nice try, beaf flaps, now post tits.
beaf
Never go full retard.
Is the season now officially over everywhere?
it's worth it if you stay near the top of the mountains and hike out to the good bowls
back country is always available if you're kitted out and are interested in that type of skiing
the season is alive and well. we were blessed with fresh snow here in switzerland
Florida?
wtf? no
Did you go /out/doors this season, or did you only stay /in/doors
not as much as i normally would, we´ve had very wet winter here

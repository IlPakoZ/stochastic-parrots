If you stay out of progressive urban centers you will be fine.
I see backpackers in my town pretty often, you'll be fine as long as you don't start begging/panhandling.
How often are hitchhikers actually killed in America, movies got me worried.
It's extremely rare, according to FBI stats.
First: American media is largely made by Wealthy White Americans crawling over each other like maggots to socially signal to each other how much they hate the wealthy, white people, and America.
Also, The US is large, both in distance and population, individual events should be considered against a population of 330 million.
Very. Luck all other travel advice, be careful in poor areas.
Backpacking across America would be boring as hell, at least the Midwest. And the climate alone would kill you in the Southwest if you got stranded and were unprepared.
Now if you mean hitchhiking instead, that hasn't been without risk since the Sixties. In my lifetime I count the number of times I got a ride or gave one on one hand (and I'm typically armed).
I need to know your race and gender to answer that question accurately.
It’s true.
It's incredibly dangerous. Why the hell would you subject yourself to something like that?
shut the fuck up urbanite
I have picked up 3 backpacking hitchhikers, all of them were male and smelled really bad. 2 of them begged me for money but wouldn't let me buy them food at which point I kicked them out, and one of those two absolutely reeked of alcohol and weed. 1 of them ate lunch with me and was decent to talk to, but he was also really fat so I assume he wasn't actually backpacking and just lived in the area as a beggar because he also didn't have anything to say about places he had been.
All in all, I probably won't pick up any more hitchhikers, they somehow give off this entitled aura. None of them thanked me for the distance I drove them, or were able to entertain me in some way. And the two that I kicked out were outright aggressive because I wouldn't give them money. I'm autistic so I don't really get that "feeling of accomplishment" or whatever from doing a "good deed", but maybe I'll try picking up a girl hitchhiker if I see one again. I'm just scared of sexual advances and women in general, so I've been avoiding them.
As safe as any other 3rd world shithole
Shush, larper. The adults are talking.
this is an English speaking board please post in English so people don't have to translate, Xang.
Kek if you're a foreigner in the US the police won't even come looking for you when something happens. You'll disappear and they'll file a report. Your name will be on some register and that'll be the end of you. 
You'll just be missing forever.
depends on which country you're from...more specifically how white your native country is. If you're from Scandinavia or Switzerland--for example--you will probably get search parties but if you're brown....ya, sorry not sorry.
I'm from Scandinavia, so guess i'm good then
How’s East Palestine doing?
That’s some 3rd world shit; literally Bhopal-tier
it's safe.
Or Flint Michigan. America is a third world country in a Gucci belt.
Fairly safe. Canadian here.
I hitchhiked the appalachian mountains from New York to Georgia. That was a great trip and most of my rides came from park rangers up and down the trail and other tourists. And did the cascade mountain from Washington state to California. Ive also hitchhiked across the midwest.
In the midwest I ran into trouble. I was robbed in Chicago and then again in Milwaukee 2 days later. Finding a ride or population center are few and far between but when I made my way into Northern WI, upper Michigan and Minnesota was it nothing but super friendly people. 
The west coast was also decent until I hung out with a bunch of other homeless people in Portland OR. They ended up stealing my cooking pot, sleeping bag, and some clothing outside of Sacramento before disappering.
I would avoid huge cities if possible.
And why is that?
Avoid big cities. Suburban midwest is and rural western America is probably the safest area you'll ever be. Appalachians get pretty cracked out, and the nigger cities are all bad 24/7, other than that you should be fine.
Take advantage of this if it makes you feel safer. Unfortunately there is no non-citizen gun program kek, but you can technically (illegally) buy one privately in a state like AZ if you really wanted to. I do not recommend breaking any laws while you're here, I'm just sharing information.
Funny how the evil Nazi rednecks will leave you in peace or render advice and assistance while the vibrant and progressive urban nexuses are riddled with crime and people who'd step over you if you collapsed in the street, isn't it?
Say, where does the anti-working class propaganda come from, anyway? Oh right, the vibrant and progressive urban nexuses. Hmmm....
If you stay out of inner cities and don't actively fuck with people you chances of being murdered are literally 0%
Kansas City and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Are the only two cities I actively avoid just because shit people. Well besides shit in Florida- and Washington, DC and New York. Consider using cities to hop through to better ones using the Greyhound service.
Dude, both of you got me 100% wrong. Ive always hated cities, but at the same time I never explore them either. That and the food is usually fantastic. Urban decay isn't something Id gloat about. This is your fucking country bud. Clean it up. 
I grew up in fuck nowhere Ontario. Only Americans I ever meet were people doing fishing trips. I ended up working for a fly-in resort and got an opportunity to go down to the US and do a show as an exibtor/salesman representing our lodge. There i got the idea of doing a backpack trip for about a month or so and see how far I get on a fixed budget of so much a day. I had an emergency fund of 2k to get me home. Best investment was a $50 mountain bike through the Appalachian trail. When I bent the rim I posted looking for a rim and boom got one for free after explaining my journey. Ran into a ton of that from the rural folks who were more than happy to help me out.
Greyhound bus stations are strict. And will leave your ass and don't fuck around with nigger shit like a waffle house. But if you end up near say Albuquerque. Why the fuk would you want to walk across that hot ass desert? When for about 150 bucks or less you can get the fuk out of there to a much nicer and greater distance. Riding through there is miserable enough in the early summer.. dunno why you would want to be outdoors to see legit nothing for DAYS. I thought I was gonna die of dehydration just being out there on a motorcycle- because free water fillups were rare as fuck. Almost every rest stop in Southern Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. Water fountains were broken or just not working. I have two wheels and can cover distances at 75miles an hour. And still would feel the need to fill my spare gallon jug in fear of how much longer before I'd find clean drinking water.
Dude, both of you got me 100% wrong.
Nothing in your entire response indicates that I misunderstood you, and generally speaking I agree with your views, so you must have gotten me wrong.
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. I too grew up rural, and city problems are not my problems to fix, even if I could, which I can't. I'm not going to devote my life to crusading for a lost cause when I can spend it /out/doors, away from the madness.
Now whether or not I can avoid and sidestep our country's problems for my entire life or if they'll catch up to me eventually even out here (I'm 40, so about 40 to go) is up for debate.
I would be really really sad if I lived a sheltered, concrete and steel life like yours
I know you're either a zoomer or English isn't your first language based on your misunderstanding of the term 3rd world.
It's extremely dangerous you should definitely stay away and go back where you came from
I’m aware that the term as to do with the sides in WW1, I’m not using it literally.
Truth is, the US shares many of the same problems with literal 3rd world countries, which is why I call it one too.
You don’t see train derailments like this in 80+% White countries, and if it did happen the government would actually do something about it instead of basically nothing
This is mildly entertaining and has decent tips. Long story short if you don't watch it, hardly anyone in the US picks up hitchhikers. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_japiE6QKWrCfn7NFL86bRSWez5DTDWt
EU has double the amount of train derailments per year as the US does.
Well that’s an easily verifiable lie, it’s about the same, but by “like this” I’m talking about ones with huge fucking chemical spills.
That’s the first thing I posted, the E Palestine spill, so sorry if you are retarded liar and can’t follow context
Stay off of my property and you'll be fine.
Not telling you where it is or how big it is, though.
It's YOUR job to figure that out.
How bout I don't.
How is it a lie? Both stats are easily visible as they're tracked by the governments in question, in 2022 Europe had 4400 collisions+derailments and the US had 2700.
by “like this” I’m talking about ones with huge fucking chemical spills.
Serbia (83% Serbian) had a train wreck that spilled Ammonia everywhere and also killed 50 people, not even 4 months ago. I'm sure I'll get some cope about how Serbia isn't white now or something.
The government did do something, they chose to burn off the chemical before it entered the water table directly. Whether it was the right choice is still up for debate, but saying they did nothing is also just wrong.
Why are Europeans so obsessed with the US? It's so fucking sad.
You’re right, it is easily checked, which is why I know you’re a filthy liar 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1128848/accidents-on-european-rail-networks-by-country/
Add them up and it’s around 1,400, which is even more impressive considering that rail traffic in Europe is probably like 5x as much if not more.
First you said the EU, and Serbia is not in the EU.
The government didn’t burn off the chemicals, the rail company did.
The government isn’t doing shit to help as far as aid goes because the government is anti-White.
I don’t live in Europe, ryou stupid gorilla nigger.
I live in the Midwest, which is how I know the US is basically a 3rd world shithole
You'll be in an unmarked shallow grave before anyone knows what happened to you.
You won't do shit.
Lmaooo mr 2nd amendment over here
You are so badass
If you're ever on my property without my permission, you'll find out.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
If you mean walking across the US, you'll need to walk on at least 1800 miles of roads which is the most dangerous thing you can do. If you mean traveling in general it's pretty safe if you stay out of shitty neighborhoods.
Assuming you don't get mugged, shot, raped, or randomly incarcerated, it's pretty safe yeah.
I told you, English, chang
This website is loaded with subhumans that hate America and obsessivly post the same rants over and over.
Why do you like living in a gay mulatto stud farm that worships jews?
Safe enough that you won't drone striked by accident. Unsafe enough that you're better off carrying a firearm
Most crime in the US is concentrated in a relatively small number of bad neighborhoods in urban areas. Other than that, these are the precautions I would take:
1. Carry bear spray at the very least.
2. If you are going to be passing through southern border states, be aware of signs of cartel activity and leave the area if you notice any.
Anon, what you picked up were homeless people, not recreational backpackers or hikers. Hikers wouldn’t beg for money or turn down food, as they have their trips budgeted and aren’t completely broke. 
Of course both homeless people and backpackers will stink, as neither has east access to regular showers.
lol
pretty safe, there's only one or two documented serial killers on the appalachian trail since the 80s and only 6 hikers go missing a year on average, usually not the long distance ones. pct is even safer, and the other ones have limited data available. unless you run into an israel keyes or can't into weather forecasts and compasses you're gucci my man.
Just avoid leftist areas and places where people go missing often sometimes areas are more dangerous (shit roads, harsh weather, agressive wildlife) and people don't realise.
Your biggest threat 90% of time is other people.
What the fuck are trail angels
Kek, me too! I start shaking and get poopoopeepee.
America is a massive and diverse country with heavily localized governments. This leads us to have the best of the best as well as the worst of the worst. Part of being an adult is choosing where you want to live (you have to be 18 to post here), so if you live in a shit hole and are not taking any steps to leave said shit hole or make it not a shithole, that's on you. There are plenty of places in the Midwest that aren't third world tier, you're just too much of a loser to get there.
How many times do I have to tell you--English, subhuman.
Boomers who think they're literal angels for handing out some bottled water
and we hate them back
source: rabbi held a class on the evils of hollywood and how according to the talmud that is brought up so much they will be burning in gehenna (hell)
That sounds sketchy as shit.
Ask me how I know you're an urbanite.
My family in montana doesn't lock their doors because if they aren't home people can still come in side if there is an emergency...their entire county is 99% white though--so there's that.
Towns and cities used to be that way too for a long time. Some unnamed ingredient was added, and it all changed.
I lived in a crowded suburb with a lot of middle class immigrant families from Japan, China, India, and a few black families. Never locked my door growing up. Never locked up my bike. Walked around at all hours of the night and had friendly chats with the bored cops. 
Moved to a rural town that had a healthy white trash community. Holy shit did that wake me up. Meth heads are animals. White trash is common and just as horrible as black trash. There's no denying it.
wow xang, you're really going for it here aren't you
Just get a gun. It's very easy here. You never know when you'll need to shoot a hitchhiker.
...I always know when I need to shoot a hitchhiker though...
You've never lived in a rural area, have you. No, mommy and daddy's house on the golf course in suburbia doesn't count.
I live on the outskirts of suburbia. Farm fields to the horizon start about 4-5 miles from me, so yes, you are correct.
A tent is an obvious indication of homelessness, and because the homeless commit the vast majority of crime in the US, anybody who is in possession of a tent is probably a criminal. Since the overloaded justice system and overcrowded prisons don't deter crime it's up to everybody else to fix the problem, which naturally includes beating to death people who are carrying tents or sleeping in them. If you want to travel in the US we have more than enough hotels to accommodate you, along with an extensive transportation system that includes airline service and car rentals.
Nothing you said is true.
Which America, North or South?
Uh, anon, I worked in 'diverse' areas, and my wallet was regularly subject to contest. I understand nig noggitry as well as any man. Not sure why im lumped into this (I was>>2556275)
mis clicked you and i ban evaded so i couldnt edit
Fuck Off, Edgelord.
This is the best post on the board right now and it isn't even close
I wouldn't worry about it
*sniiiiiff*
Pthpthpththth
Just knock on a door in Appalachia and offer 200 bucks for a pistol that may or may not have been used in a murder in 2002.
Sounds like a good way to end up on the missing persons list.
Samefag
Just try not to look like a turkey
Good post.
i'd pack a 9 to be safe. Personally I work in an industrial area which is in the hood so I open carry.
Safe as fuck...
God, are you faggots that retarded?
You can walk into the worst neighborhoods in the world and be fine if you have common sense...
I love how you can spot the seething rural people with comments like "Muh liberul cities".
In impoverished rural states like west Virginia, Mississippi or even in places like upstate NY, you won't fine more meth heads/opiate addicts and theviery than in any inner city ghetto. Combined with the fact these counties and municipalities are often corrupt and run by the same incestuous good ol' boys you are far more likely to be hassled or even rob with little immediate recourse. These are also the same boomer retards waving Maga flags and voting for the same politicians that dick them over and then blame the "liberals" in the city.
I live in NYC and if anything it's too sterile.
The biggest danger of backpacking in America is litterally getting hit by a car, than any criminal behavior. but I will call out the Euros on this that Americans drive far more conservatively then countries like Italy or France but we also have less mass transit except in some cities.
You're an idiot. I've lived in suburban, urban, and rural environments and the inner-cities were by far the worst in terms of crime. But since you live in NYC, I encourage you to keep thinking that rural counties are horrible places to live and keep away. You're probably right on one count: your kind isn't well-liked around here and you would quickly be run out of town by the locals who would make life absolute hell for you.
They really are, and it’s tiresome. I don’t know if it’s Europeans or Zoomers or what, but there’s a lot of cowardice on /out/.
Your definition of bad/good rural is likely very different, Also there are more shitty rural places that easily fit the category of inner city ghetto. Just replace the gangs and Cocaine with meth heads and opiate addicts who will rob you without a second thought.
But since we are discussing it, WV by far has the worst rural crime and poverty but as a backpacker you are unlikely to deal with them since most of the outdoor activities and trails like the AT are pretty isolated from that.
OP If you really want to avoid questionable rural areas, Maine and Vermont are very safe rural areas with very nice people. NH is not bad but the areas around dover are shitty.
Mississippi particularly on the Alabama border are really shitty, Nevada is nice but the areas East of Vegas and reno are litteral meth capitals.
Why the fuck would you go to Nevada? Especially if you're from the east coast.
All you have to do is stitch a Canadian flag to your backpack and that lets people know that you're not an American.
Only Americans larping as Canadians do that. It's a dead giveaway.
KEK
Just avoid major cities and you will be fine.
I don't think personal safety is really a thing in America anymore. People get robbed and murdered on trails and in national forests and parks.
Start in downtown Baltimore, you should be fine
I hitchhiked from Vancouver BC to Redding, CA (with a couple bus trips in between). Everyone who picked me up was friendly, helpful, and reasonably good conversationalists. 
The basic principle is that if you sense something is up with someone, don't get in in the first place. I carried a knife and bear spray concealed on my person at all times and only once felt slightly worried. Greentext incoming
tl;dr missed my chance at a geriatric blowjob
Smart move desu, for all you know he had a taser or roofie hidden away somewhere.
Every time I see this tagline, I wonder what non-extreme midget wrestling looks like.
It really feels like you just can't "go" anywhere now. Like even if you just loaded up your stuff and took off in a random direction walking through the wilderness eventually someone's camera or drone or light plane would see you and they'd call the cops and the FBI and they'd want to know why you were just walking around by yourself in the middle of nowhere and what places you've visited within the past 3 years
West coast
Should be fine
Rockies
Might run into some methheads who can be a problem but will probably be fine
Southwest
Safe as long as you don’t go in the summer and stay away from the Mexican border
Southeast
Dangerous to go alone. A lot of crime. Take weapons for self defense
Midwest
Not as bad as Southeast but still should watch your back especially if you go near Chicago
Appalachia
Mixed. A lot of weirdos out there and dangerous terrain but still doable
Should be fine.
anon.
that is a LONG ASS way to go.
Consider doing a north-south run.
like the cascades.
It runs through the parts of the northwest that aren't shit.

What's the easiest way to die while being /out/?
In my experience? It's always gonna be dumb shit.
Trying to wade across rivers with too much current. 
Climbing on slippery/icy rocks, breaking something and unable to get help.
Fucking around and finding out with wildlife. 
Hypothermia or heat stroke. Honestly easily to over do it especially by yourself. By time you start to notice it's already too late. 
Dehydration... Drink all ur water first worry about finding more later. 
Crazy people can be reasoned with/ manipulated. Someone on drugs cannot. Please understand the difference... For example a skitzo having an episode- you can use your phone camera to prove to them you're real and anything else their seeing isn't. Their brains cannot fake shit on screens.
In cities/large towns say over 100,000 population. The mentality of "not my monkeys not my problem" will take you far. It's fine to help someone in need if you can, but only if it preserves your well-being.
Being drunk off your ass on vodka in a shitty tent and redneck stove on a mountain in a snowstorm at night is a pretty good way to do it
Noguns is the best way to die while being /out/.
9/10 /out/ problems are solved with guns.
Lost: 3 evenly spaced shots every hour or two or when you think you might be in earshot of someone
Animal: Shoot it
Hungry: Eat the animal you shot
Cold and wet need fire: You have between 6 and 15 metal capsules filled with fire guarantee powder.
Bees: The gun cannot help you, run
Drowning: Try shooting the water idk learn to swim what are you black.
Predatory humans: Shoot them and take their stuff.
Drowning is a very common one.
river crossings.
mummy's curse
exposure
Being a dumbass with a gun.
my guess is dehydration/disorientation in desert areas
primarily from people who aren't familiar with the terrain or region and don't realize just how intense the sun can be out there, dehydrating them quickly, which makes them get disoriented, then getting lost, and dying from exposure
Falling into a Ravine
A Falling rock hits your head.
Go back to /a/ and /k/
Smokeless powder is absolutely fucking terrible for starting fires, you're better off trying just about anything else instead of wasting time cracking cartridges open to get a tiny amount of powder that will go poof and leave you still very cold and gay and retarded, except now you're a cold gay retard with no ammo.
very cold and gay and retarded
kek
Underestimating nature because you are used to infrastructure
People don't seem to realize that there is not just a warm door to walk into around the corner if something happens
you are just one stupid mistake from dying a faggots death at all times when /out/
Relaxing
Underestimating wet weather conditions especially in early spring and autumn or in the mountains often leads to the number one cause of death: Hypothermia. 
Getting lost or injuring your feet/legs is probably not far behind.
And also not having a gun.
It really instills a lot of respect for people that came over from Europe to the new world.
Have you ever burned modern powder? It burns far slower than black powder. Pull the bullet out of a rifle cartridge and pour the powder in a small pile. Touch it off with a match. You get a huge flare up that will last a couple seconds and can start dry tinder easily.
if you have a match and dry tinder you can light a fire
yeah
Depends on your definition of easy. Low effort = exposure or drowning. Quickest = fall to your death. Least painful = CO poisoning in a hot tent.
basic needs for survival
1) AIR, thus drowning and allergies closing off your throat valve/lungs
2) Water, dehydration, bleeding out, and generally not having enough water will cause you to be a blabbering/quiet death in most cases. Also drinking most water sources without filtering/boiling will lead to massive amounts of Diarrhea, a major killer in third-world countries and places with shit water.
3) Food, but most Americans are fat-asses that could naturally survive for weeks, sometimes Months without food. Also most people don't know what is safe to eat(mushrooms are crap for nutrition and return on investment), berries are often VERY POISONOUS, same for several kinds of leaves and roots. Most don't know how to kill, bleed, skin and process their own meats(half of hunters included here) And fish are becoming more and more stocked by the respective states that have area's to fish in just to meet demand.
4) SHELTER, this one can jump up to the second place. In extreme heat or extreme cold(water/wind/sleet/snow). This is more important than a fucking fire. But everyone thinks that a fire is the one solution to all their woe's, and end up burning themselves and everyone else's homes to ash in dry regions.
Someone doesn't dress for the weather, goes to a hiking trail/camp area, gets lost or spooked/chased/drug bender. Doesn't have a sweater/windbreaker and starts freezing. Drifts off to sleep. Passes. Desert climates tends to catch those who live in them off guard way too frequently. Go and its over a hundred during the day. Only have a tanktop/swimming trunks and t-shirt on. Get lost, fart around, turns to night. Desert turns cold FAST. Sweaty clothes chill them, they shiver, dehydrate. Die. People go to ski-slope, ski off trail. Get lost. No reception because most mountains block all signals. Sun goes down. GET VERY COLD. Didn't pack a blanket/wind barrier. Freeze.
Major injuries, usually from falling/slipping, jumping over shit for shits/tiktok.
Americans are fat-asses that could naturally survive for weeks, sometimes Months without food.
Truly the most powerful race. When then world supply lines collapse and food is gone, Americans will rise from the ashes months later into a new golden American age.
exposure, heat or cold is easily number 1. then injury including from a slip or fall. i'd think animals or just being a general idiot is number 3. plenty of people get drunk or high and then fall, drown, hit an artery with a blade, fight a bear, shoot them selves or whatever else.
Sasquatch probably
Wearing cotton.
falling
Being killed by angry people with snowmobiles (aka "an avalanche").
while taking a selfie at the edge of a cliff
in my experience
do you die often?
Video game child logic
Stupidity.
Going by deaths that have occured near me, and in no particular order:
fixed blade knives
for some reason several outdoorspeople have apparently died in my area from either accidentally stabbing themselves when they slip and fall on their backpack, or accidentally cutting a major artery in their leg (perhaps due to their sheath failing?)
avalanches, especially snowmobilers
tree wells, skiers and snowboarders
snow buried stream, snowboarders
using small craft during a storm
diving in shallow water
swept away by currents, rivers
hypothermia
equipment failure, rock climbing
wildlife (very rare, usually from cornering or pursuing animals)
boat collisions, or getting hit by a boat
Overpacking and poorly packed rucks seems to be a frequent issue. Carrying a rifle is fun, I think less convenient than one would expect. Usually wildlife is a long ways off by the time you get there. And it isn't usually very convenient to hunt for things, with the exception of grouse.
THIS
Easiest? Suicide. Most likely? Dehydration or exposure, depending on the weather.
Lack of water and unfamiliarity with climate. It's easier to die in hot places. We can live a long time without food, not so much without water.
Aimo Koivunen's story tells us that even without fire its not that fucking hard to survive in the winter.
Everything else can more or less be planned with gear. There's a very low chance will die of hypothermia if you're going somewhere and know how to prepare for the cold. If you get too hot you can open up your jacket or take off layers. As long as you have a fire and a shelter that blocks wind you can be pretty comfy.

kek this made me laugh, thank you anon
not replying to this post
Falling, drowning, unpreparedness for weather, laying on the earth, lightning, falling wood or earth, and self-impalement/lacerations with huge knifes you don't need.
stab yourself accidentally to thigh and pull knife out
Underequipment
Easiest
Hunting accident, hands down. Wander into the wrong spot, don't wear orange, catch a .30-06 to the dome, wake up on the big gold escalator to the clouds not knowing what happened.
Easiest is powersports by far. Handful of people get killed every year in my state in ATV or snowmobile accidents. Just drive them too fast, fail to negotiate a curve, 50MPH headlong into a tree and you get to see Queen Elizabeth II again (unless you've been a righteous person, which I doubt since you're on here).
Also, cliffs. The most beautiful parts of nature are also the ones where you die if you step the wrong way. A lot of deaths occur on mountains in bad weather conditions when the rocks are slippery.
Compounding both of those is alcohol or other intoxicants. Most people that die /out/ are not sober when it happens. It's a ton of fun to get drunk or high and ride snowmobiles at reckless speeds or climb around on mountains in the rain. Sometimes it just kills you.
Compelling natural force, duh
pop some tramadol + alcohol
fall asleep in -30C temperature
farting REALLY hard, sometimes everything else starts flowing out with the fart, or in the worst case, it backfires and blows your head clean off. Seen it happen too many times.
1) injury
2) exposure
3) dehydration
Pretty much in that order but any of them can lead to another one of these being the one that actually kills you
It depends on what you mean by easiest and what you're outing is 
If you're on a mountain it's probably just taking a tumble
If you're camping I'd wager hypothermia
alcohol, night and swimming
still need fiber, nutrients that get pissed out, salt being one, water being another, look up those somewhat messed up diets for those going long term no real food to keep from fucking up your internal organs and surviving
How painful/instant is a falling tree branch death? Not talking about a whole tree just imagine like a 10 ft branch breaking off and landing on your tent
Paul Harrell did a video on this. Rifle powder can and will get a fire going.
Made the euragatans seethe anon, guns from scary vidya is too much for them
bear
it's always bear
Telling nobody where you’re going.
If you’re a noob then it’s going out of your depth.
Lost: 3 evenly spaced shots every hour or two or when you think you might be in earshot of someone
There are 130db survival whistles that only weigh 1oz.

At the very least know basic land navigation or have a pre-set panic azimuth in terms of getting lost.

textspeak in 2013
Dead giveaway. Learnt from experience, this nigga died for some BPD clutz.
if this is the average type of person who goes /out/ i guess we can add "getting shot by a retard" to the list
I have read a bunch of the "death in xyz national park" books.
Per those, I beleive the top risk factors are hiking alone, being male (tend to take more risks), and stuff having to do with water.
Shit tons of people get killed by water.
Weather
Not drinking water
Falling
Fuck off to reddit where you are most missed by the furry community.
/k/ is the brother board of /out/.
They are welcome. You are not, cockcutter.
you dont have to worry because you live in nogunz Netherlands but this works in countries with actual wilderness
suicide
the top risk factors are hiking alone, being male
what the fuck do you want me to do? i ask family, coworkers, inlaws. zero people want to do anything with me, its on them if i die and i will haunt them
Not drinking water
probably this
tourists do it every year in my state lol
haha lets take a short walk down this path with one bottle of water each
whole family dies
I don't know what is more scary to think about at night when in my hammock: the threat of branches breaking or the fact that my tarp leaves me exposed for a bear to just walk up right to my face and I'd be asleep.
Why aren't there DIY 360 thermal imaging cameras to place around my campsite in the trees which will alarm and shine a floodlight on the creature?
Bees: The gun cannot help you, run
kek. got a chuckle out of me.
Live combat on the field of honor
Helicopter guns and missiles, drones, artillery, bombs
6.8 Creedmoor pissin hot with steel melting Tungsten rounds
Grenades, sniper fire, full auto belt-fed machine guns
Deadly traps, snares, anti-personnel mines
In the mountains where my people dwelt
For thousands upon thousands of years
Honestly that's not going to do much if it's a live tree. If it's a now limb, it won't gain much momentum so won't hit very hard. A high limb will hit a lot of other limbs on the way down, also not gaining much momentum. They also don't just snap off on live trees. It will wreck your tent, bruise you up, but I'd be surprised if a 10' branch broke a bone. That short a limb will only be a few inches in diameter. Even larger stuff won't kill you outright. More likely you get pinned and die a slow agonizing death. It's going to take a whole tree pile ;driving you or a freak dead limb spearing you to make it quick.
They also don't just snap off on live trees
sure they do. Winds, disease, heavy snow or ice etc...can cause branches to give way. Numerous people have died from falling branches

realizing that traveling and experiencing nature isn't fixing your depression and blowing your brains out
Someone doesn't dress for the weather, goes to a hiking trail/camp area, gets lost or spooked/chased/drug bender. Doesn't have a sweater/windbreaker and starts freezing. Drifts off to sleep. Passes.
My cousin died exactly like that in february. High on I don't know what drugs and a French Alps mountain, goes for a walk/tries to escape some hallucination, disapears for three weeks. Someone finds his frozen body in a small ravine, dude fell asleep in his little polo shirt and denim shoes. What a mess.

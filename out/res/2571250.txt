Went for a hike in 20C/68F weather yesterday and it was shit. All the snow has melted which was breathtakingly beautiful. 
Not to mention it’s so much worse to exert yourself and sweat when it’s even remotely warm- way harder to cool off and there’s only so little clothes you can wear.
Hate getting sweaty and gross. Wtf this is so weird before I started hiking I didn’t like winter. 
Does anyone relate? I want winter back. The trails look like a magical paradise escape.
You think it's bad now? Wait 2 months for Sahara temperatures to come back.
I fucking hate warm weather it’s just sweating heatstroke lots of water and peeing and sunburn and cancer
Come to fucking minnesota, we just got 4 inches of snow the other day and it's still barely above 0C. Oh wait it's -1C...
Try losing some weight fatty
piss on yourself to cool yourself down
winter is over
not where I am. Temps still 15-20° below average. Locals mts just got 40 inches of snow this past week. Next week will mark a full 6 months of snowcover imby. 6 months of winter.
Have you tried not being fat and/or a bitch
t. regards floridaman
I live in New England so around March it goes from snow to warm sunny days over and over so the trails are always muddy.
Peak outdoor weather is October-January.
Sweat? That means you're FAT LMAO HAHA FAT FAT FAT FAT FATTY FAT FAT THIS FAT LARD ACTUALLY SAID THE WORD SWEAT WHAT A PILE OF FAT SHIT
Fatty fatty 2x4 detected
I was sweating out in -25C, dreading summer
and dangling balls
nah. I have had snow imby for 6 months. Its snowed last night...i am ready for warmers temps.
I don't mind getting sweaty, but holy shit do I hate fucking swamp ass.
I don’t mind the heat or humidity. Survival of the fittest out here, nature separates the weak from the strong. To strive and struggle and endure til you see it through and completed, makes you feel alive. Like mountain climbing.
The ticks are biting after like 35 mins this year here.
'Ate Mud Season

Simple as.
bitch i'm still fucking waiting for it to warm up past 50f, shits cold as fuck

Thank you little flower :)
Based thread.
Asters are the best..ers
Thank you OP.
You reminded me of flowers from last spring.
It's dead now, you killed it.
It gave you beauty and you gave it death. You have the world miserable and you should BE miserable!
I appreciated it more than anybody else would have before it got cut by a weed whacker. Nice try shill
Is this the thread to post cool flowers ?
I don't know what this is, but pretty cool that you can clearly see that it is a parasite because it has no green leaves
Thatâ€™s really interesting anon, that makes sense
Thanks! Saw a bunch of them, I don't know what they are, southern France
Colchicum alpinum
Thanks man!
he touched grass
NO NO NO BROS SOON HE'S GONNA WAKE UP AND STOP BEING MISERABLE AND REALIZE OUR INTERNET POSTS DON'T MATTER

Flowers are fun to go looking for

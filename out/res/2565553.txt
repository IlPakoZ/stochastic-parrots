That's really cool. I love places like that where everything just seems to be exploding with life. In my area we don't get air roots but we do get every last surface covered in fluffy green moss. It's thick like snow in some places, clinging to the branches and twigs. Sometimes you even see ferns growing out of it. Magical.

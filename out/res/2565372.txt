Ive got a good deal on 3.5 acres of undeveloped land ($10k) that im ready to purchase. The problem is that it is very dense, with mostly pines that are about forearm thickness. I dont want to strip the area bare, but the woods are so dense that i can barely walk through them or hunt, so how do i clear some of the undergrowth without going broke? 
Ideas: have the local paper mill come get them, but idk if theyd be interested in tiny trees
Fire department do a proscribed burn

Burn it down. Those pine saplings will go right up they are full of sap.
Prescribed burn, clears out all the underbrush. If you let a company harvest it, they're taking everything and only replanting pines.
just develop the entire earth
Your sins will find you out.
Depending on the amount of time you’re willing to invest, hedge trimmers work pretty well for this.
Our land is pretty similar to that in terms of foliage density; I started cutting through trails with the trimmers and gradually thinned it down over a few seasons.
The good news is that once the understory is cleared it doesn’t grow back.
chainsaw or burn undergrowth. slow but it'll work work with the fire department if go the burn route so you dont set the whole area on fire like an asshole.
super effective solution - rent a bulldozer. i got a mid sized one and it easily knocked down pretty good sized pine trees probably 30 inch diameter, several at a time. All in cost including the guy driving it was just under 3 grand.Took him most of a day to clear about 2 acres, around a 300x300 foot area.
You know that woowoos set fire to the woods to clear them and drive entire buffalo herds off cliffs right?
It will definitely take time. You ve got to gut an easment to the lot before i can do anything. It looks like it used to be a timber farm anyway. >>2565385
These wannabe ecotard fascists won’t let silly things like reading comprehension or common sense get in the way of their soap boxing. Just ignore and carry on.
But seriously, hedge trimmers my man. Cut through and start making trails. 3.x acres isn’t much and you can get it done a few weekends. (Assuming you don’t want to knock down trees, then you reall need a dozer or similar )
Long term, i would love to get some native growth back. Hickory, pawpaws, oak. Right now its just pine, greenbriar and gum. 
Or even cooler might be a micro farm on one acre with a little hut. The older i get, the less i want to be around people
Thick underbrush was caused by human intervention in natural fire processes.
Chainsaw and a brush cutter blade on a powerful weed Wacker. 3.5 acres could take a while, but it is very doable. Spacing is the name of the game once you get the obvious dead out. Pick and choose good vegetation, and clean out the struggling plants out. You want sunlight to get through to the forest floor.
Burning is a very different proposition, but I work in a high desert. No experience because of the high risks involved. Only done manual forestry work.
Rent a wood chipper and spread the mulch around. Areas with erosion, bare hill sides, just back into the trees.
2 inches or so thick is good to help existing ground cover. 4-6 inches will kill off most of the existing ground cover. Seed local grasses/wildflowers in both cases unless it is a path.
This anon knows. Also, fire departments are loath to do prescribed burns unless it's absolutely necessary, and then only on public land.
burn
unironically
Craigslist offering free lumber, just come and get it. Or maybe take a beat and plot out your land in order to keep some older trees for shade and treehouses.
Where do you live? Somewhere with internet at least?
Moves to a forest
cuts it all down
why do you retards keep posting this shit here.
idiots.
Go back to r/logging. Atleast I have a better idea of how many retarded boomers post their logging industry retardation here.
How’s that dorm room treating you my zoomer friend?
Bullock teams were the way in the old days, they used them for heavy lifting but they'd also just let them out to pasture in the scrub and they'd soon turn it into a nice green paddock. They love smashing things and eating everything.
Leave it as it is? Surely there must be some tax writeoff for leaving rural land undeveloped.
Sounds like a tinderbox though; he’d be on the hook for a wildfire.
Wood chipper works, but burn piles are easier and less time consuming. That's the method I've used. We clear small areas at at time and drag the brush to a center point where it can be safely burned.
Have you actually pushed through into the woods? Edge tends to be overgrown because it gets more sun. Interior may be a lot easier to navigate if its older growth. You might only need to bushwhack for 20' or so in my experience.

Get an industrial grade weed eater with the saw blade attachment. Don't fuck around with the low end models or electric bullshit from Walmart, get the big fuckoff Stihl one with the thing that looks like bicycle handlebars, the one all the landscape Mexicans use. That with a saw blade will eat through underbrush and even small trees like butter and you won't throw out your back cutting at weird angles like you would have to with a chainsaw.
Nothing wrong with clearing land with fire. It's what you do afterwards that's the issue. The redskinniggers let the forest grow back after burning it for the most part, and it made up part of a sustainable and healthy life cycle for the ecosystem. The issue was when we started burning it and then using it all for development or big monoculture farms instead of letting the trees grow back.
drove herds of buffalo off cliffs
There were enough buffalo that it could be sustainable. That's one thing I think people today don't realize is how many fucking buffalo there used to be. The entire plains were chock fucking full of them. We didn't accidentally overhunt them to near extinction, that would have taken decades longer than it did. We deliberately tried to eradicate them in basically an all out war to get the redniggers under control via starvation.

Haha, love dabbing on shitlibs
That is fascinating
My uncle hired two wetbacks to clear his land.
Burn piles are still too risky for where I'm at. We also go get more use from chipping. Wood mulch is much more valuable for erosion control and moisture retainment. Than bio char and ash are for fertilizing. At least for us.
And it is only time consuming when piled poorly.
Protips for slash piles.
Pile with all cut ends all facing one direction. Keep the ends in line with one another.Limits entanglement, huge time saver.
It is best to sort stuff a little. Longer limbs on the ground. Keep stacking shorter limbs on it after you got a small base. Sounds autistic but it keeps the mess on the pile. Along with aiding in grabbing a good chunk at a time when chipping.
Make more smaller piles, not fewer big ass piles. Most properly stacked piles, under 4 feet tall by 10 feet wide, are quick.
If you have an absolute fucking mass of material to get rid of, and can safely burn? Do it, I will never knock that option.

That said, cow farts are causing global warming. Internet 3.0 told me so.
They say goats are the ultimate land clearers

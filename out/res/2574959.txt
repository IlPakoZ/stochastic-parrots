I am interested in visiting "illegal" places, places where the public is not generally allowed. My interest rests in seeing interesting places but I would still adhere to the basic rules of leave no trace. Is there a term for this type of exploration? While urban exploration is a similar concept I am looking for something more rural, or historical sites that are generally closed off. 
The purpose of this thread is to ask my fellow /out/doorsmen how do you suggest I go about this trip to St. Croix? It appears to be about 1 km out from where the staff are viewed. I don't think they have a very large staff so my best chance I think is to kayak early morning and leave before noon in a dull or camo colored kayak.
I trespass on old ww2 sites constantly. 
Do it in the middle of the night when there is no moon. If you're going to do an aincent site you might as well do it old-world stealth method.

God's speed anon

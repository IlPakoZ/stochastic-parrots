I woke up this morning to the gentle sound of rain, it was before sun rise and still dark. I made some coffee. Then I went outdoors and waited for the sun to slowly come out. As it did I noticed a frog hopping around in the puddles on the brick. He did this for quiet some time until he decided to crawl into a crevice in the bricks. I went and got my phone to type this but when he came out he was gone.
I couldnâ€™t believe he had gone in such a short time. I went over and poked the crevice with a leaf and then I saw movement. I returned to my seat and continued drinking coffee. And eventually his head peaked out a bit and then I took this picture.
And that is why I like the outdoors.
Fucking love the rain. And I love how it scares everyone away so you can have some quiet time to enjoy little moments like yours.

I think that might be a toad anon. He likes the rain but not too much
Frogs hop, toads.. lumber. Toads also have warty skin and look dry-ish .. frogs are sleek and usually look wet or slimy. Frogs have stronger back legs because toads basically don't hop--especially compared to frogs.
Something that surprises me but I don't mind at all is how most people absolutely hate rain
HOLY FOOOKEN SHIT
I was zonked out on ashwaghanda all day, watching Patty Mayo on YT and eating until at 11 PM rain started POURING like crazy. Man that got me so excited that i had the urge to run /out/ but i didn't because i'm too comfy. No rain and clear sunny skies for weeks(ughh...) and now THIS? Damn, feels hella nice ngl. Frfr no cap.
I sure asf hope that tomorrow's gonna be a rainy one!

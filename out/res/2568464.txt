I'm a tranny. I sit inside all day looking for threads to post this image on. I have clearly escaped the cycle by refusing to exist within the confines in which the cycle itself exists.
I am superior.
I am immortal.
Just like the tranny meme, this doesn't hurt the people you're trying to hurt. 
I can look down and see my dick. I know I'm not a tranny. Also you can call me a LARPer all you want, I know what I've hiked.
Perhaps it's the idea of caring about what others think of you that makes you so gay. But I don't know. I'm not an indoors tranny.
You are a LARPer
I've seen pics and posts like that before when I was a shut in neet and they help long term if they make you upset
I love to take life advice from losers. 
Do you fbi retards even think before you post?
I don't think they actually do, because the board has seen a measurable decrease in post quality over the years. /out/ is inundated with "I'm le tired of society and I want to run away innawoods" threads, posted by /in/cels that won't actually do something as simple as going outside for the first time. They post about it constantly, but they don't do it. 
In any case >>2568466 is right. This thread just makes OP look like a spastic.
seething maladaptive daydreamer. literally go outside and this shit wouldn't bother you.
I only go outside to convince myself that I'm not a seething maladaptive daydreamer.
It's all over.
I actually believe that.
that feel when I grabbed this as the first thing I could find on google images for shitting on a runaway from home poster awhile ago and watched how it has grown legs and paid such dividends in lulz
Larp

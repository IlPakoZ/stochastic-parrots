why is every thread people fighting with eachother? I am new here but usually chill at other boards and they feel like a more close community but coming on here just makes me depressed
Welcome to the worst board on all of 4chan.
We're actually all good friends irl but /out/ is where we post our fantasies. None of us actually ever go outside. Just hang /out/ and have a drink with us and HARDEN THE FUCK UP. 
Aw shit anon, I was just joshin' ya. Here, have a beer. Want some trail mix? Here, pull that Helinox Chair Zero up closer to the fire. 
You sure got a purty mouth...
The main strategy of the parasites that infest this shithole is to divide. 
In no case can they allow a feeling of rapport to develop, or this dump would create an army of dissidents willing to cause chaos irl in defense of their frends. 
The jannies reserve their fiercest loathing for anons that are nice. 
It's a microcosm of the jewSA, same principles apply.
There are 2 or 3 guys who sit on this board 24/7 constantly complaining about what /out/ 'used' to be they samefag threads to death if they don't like the subject.
I'm pretty sure they're genuine oldfags that used to use other boards but can't cope with how much 4chan has changed and so have abandoned them focusing all of their effects on /out/ in a last ditch attempt at saving one board. Unfortunately they are prone to autistic meltdowns and have taken on the role of pseudo-jannies (this board does not have dedicated jannies all moderation comes from other boards) and all of this has lead to utter chaos here. What you have is a minority of people with extremely strong opinions, autism, multiple IP addresses and a moderation team that do not understand this board and so delete anything with the most reports.
/out/ has tons of newfags with shit takes and tiresome bullshit opinions based on little or no experience. And I don’t mean they’re new to the board. They’re new to outdoor recreation.
because we actually don't go out we just larp and buy expensive shit to post them on here but we usually don't step outside
i kek'd
The “show us your kit” thread is almost entirely jokes and AliExpress budget gear.
Oyyyyy veyyy, most of us don't have $100 to spend on schlocky trinkets, $80 is a lot of money. $60 is too much for that, go ask your mom for $50.
This is 4chan.
Hating things is kinda our schtick.
hey fuck you
conceptually its a self defeating board. it can only really be used to discuss gear and locations, after that? You go outside. So people argue over using a knife to baton wood and what water bottle is best, what's the best ultralight under 100 dollar tent, etc. Consumerism, elitism and other shit. Its like, if you go out and take a couple pics, share 'em here I guess but why bother? Oh well. Its fun to check in on in case somebody actually has a good story, but ultimately, if you go outside, you're not on 4chan.
The elections brought in a shit ton of morons. Their unmitigated stupidity drove away anything of value.
Oh, terribly sorry anon. We'll all hold hands and sing Kumbaya for you.
Mostly drunk /k/ommsndoes and /pol/ tards who escaped
because /out/ is too vague for a board topic, so you have fags saying they like hiking arguing with ATV/motorbikering fags over who has the right to some public land because no one here can afford their own land. this board is literally every single public land argument over every single little thing, because you're all gay poorniggers get fucked faggots
Not me, I post quality stuff.
https://youtu.be/Da7GSy-6mJY?t=57 [Embed]
Only nuanced and experienced outfags can distinguish the sarcasm and trolling from genuine advice. 
Sure, I post kek gear on "gear threads" that's what they are for.
for the past 3 or so years this board has been nothing but crossposting and shitposting sewer by corona tourists mainly from /pol/ 
things might never get back to normal but OC, fishing and hortonomy threads are always here so it feels like home
This board probably a microcosm of outdoor recreation issues at the national scale, which boils down to too many people trying to use available resources. That's why we're trying to slow population growth and limit access to public lands -- the sooner we can prevent unnecessary access, the sooner the ecosystems will recover. WEF corporate partners and governments strive to bring social responsibility to outdoor recreation. With your cooperation we will achieve equity in the outdoors and reverse global warming.
aka locking poor people into their wagecages and homepods.
Brb have to burn some tyres
At least we go /out/ to go shooting.
I think there are two main contributors to the infighting:
1. The influx of /pol/tards.
2. Gear-obsessed anons who love to argue over equipment.
don't forget the runaway from home men-children.
And the influx from /a/ and lebbit thanks to vaguely outdoors-related animes
That's why I stopped coming on 4chan so much man I used to enjoy it when I was an edgy little cunt but holy shit there's no point. All hobby focused boards are just arguing about gear, /g/ /k/ /p/ and /out/ is just a pissing match of who bought the latest meme and weirdo gay brand loyalty
Fishing general is filled with anglers who actually know their shit. You can sift through the banter and the troll posting quite easily if you're an avid angler. The common thing you see is non-anglers shitting on bass fishermen despite the fact the few bass guys who post their regularly absolutely know a thing or two and don't mind handing out advice. Then there's a bunch of fly anglers yearning to teach, a bunch of PNW anglers who catch nice trout / steelhead, etc. 
We have 1 or 2 people who try to shit it up, but everyone has learned to make fun of them and move on. Look at /off-road general/ and it's the exact opposite. One guy has been trolling them for ~3 months now it seems and they still keep replying to him and nothing of value is discussed due to it.
Agreed. I think it’s the biggest problem. Maybe it’s because the concept of going outdoors is so simple that deviation from normal experience seems so dumb or made up.
Real schizo hours
What other board feels like a more close community? Every board I've ever used has someone ready to call you a retard on it at a moment's notice similar to here.
I know it's you bro you post the exact same pics over and over again
All I do is gatekeep and complain
leave, no one will miss you.
You reddlt retards have zero self awareness and have bant I'd expect from a tween (boring, repetitive, almost never relevant, whiny)
This retard, for example, posts this in every thread. 
Imagine being so self absorbed you think you speak for other people on an anonymous website.
Lots of words to say something retarded 
in a thread about trash quality on the board.
Truly retarded ant totally lacking self awareness. No wounder life is hard for you.
Reddlt transplants can't comprehend every board belongs to /pol/ and /pol/ evolved from /b/... /out/ was an afterthought and is one of the "new" boards.
Reddlt retards come here and try to make it a hugbox echo chamber and get pissy because they don't comprehend what it is and cry about not being able to gatekeep, shame, and group think consensus like they're accustomed to.
tl;dr: Reddlt transplants are retarded but no one tells them on reddlt because of uproot and censorship then they come here and get slammed for being retarded and cry about it constantly.
No, that's easily /k/ since the whole ukraine bullshit started.
This place really does have the absolute worst takes on a lot of stuff, and it’s really old, tiresome bullshit.
Remember the thread about taking off your shoes vs leaving them on when crossing a creek? Absolute retard tier opinions.
Let me guess. You're the retard who keeps his shoes on for creek crossings. Years later you're still butthurt over getting called out for your dumbfuck opinion.
It was an even split, with half of everyone leaving their shoes on and the other half telling everyone what they would do if they ever went outside.
The Eagle Rock Loop trail in Ouachita NF is just under 30 miles long with 11 creek crossings (I think it’s 13 after a heavy rain). Would you really stop every ~3 miles to take off your shoes?
I would walk barefoot the entire time instead of putting my shoes on and off like a sperg. Barefoot chads win again.
kek based i do enjoy those waterproof shoes tho. imagine going for a hike unprepared
thanks for making this place unbearable
/out/ truly is the biggest schizo board, those nights under the stars clearly have done nothing for your mental disposition.
On the sheltowee me and my friend took our shoes off for the first few crossings after that we just left our shoes on for the next 100.
Holy shit, fucking pottery
Lemme esplain
Biggest outdoor groups in the country
So just looking at those groups and considering thier typical ideals, a meeting of the minds is doomed to fail
post tits
This
times are getting tough and retards need a place to vent where theyre not held accountable for their behaviour.
You fuckers are so overdramatic. Have you ever been to /b/? /gif/? /lgbt/? /vt/? /trash/?
Only after the pilgrimmage to all five of those places, will you know true peace from this evil.
lush deciduous forests
/b/ is made for trolling and /gif/ is porn and gore. I don’t think either is a blue bird. /tttt/ is just the end result of discovering pornography at 11 years old and caters to the mentally disturbed. So it’s not an apt comparison.
/lgbt/ is a horrible board where you have to egg on people's mental illness or catch a 3 day ban for "trolling". In /out/ I can say fishing is for gaywads and fishers should just shoot the fish with 50 caliber bullets and the mods won't do shit
Freeer speech = better board quality.
Also, you clearly haven't gone to /b/ or /gif/ in years if that's you're impression of them. Go now. Check all five of them out. Then come back and tell me /out/ is the worst place on this godforsaken site.
It's the Americans. Go to any euro /out/ thread and it's great. Until the muttoids come in and shit everything up that is
/b/ is made for porn and the andy sixx meme. /gif/ is made for bbc/trans psyop threads and tiktok ylyl threads. i used to edit webms and put screamers in them for the lulz
fixed
People who actually go out are chill it's the LARPing faggots from /pol/ and /k/ that stir shit up constantly in every thread
Most of /out/ doesn't actually care about /out/ stuff directly, they are largely schizoids who use the outdoors, or even just the idea of the outdoors, as a coping mechanism, and being socially retarded mental cripples means they are all in a constant state of misery and are always looking for the closest scapegoat, that being the mental cripple right next to them.
Assumptions, assumptions, assumptions
It's people who constantly make assumptions about other users (i.e. you) who have made this board complete dogshit the past few years.
And projections. Particularly the part about being mentally crippled.
kek, take your meds retard.
Post nose
It's pretty chill if you hang out while americans are asleep. There's a couple of good threads still going. People bickering and obvious trolls / underage posters are pretty easy to pick out and are easily filtered when you click the blue arrow, but hatred is inescapable on 4chan
/tttt/
Underrated and highly accurate post. /lgbt/ is now exclusively straight male "transbians" taking estrogen in an attempt to get laid by other straight males who have been on HRT for longer. It's an entertaining freakshow. Grab a drink and enjoy the ride
Not that anon but if you don't have $100 a week of disposable income to spend on trinkets, you're failing at life and don't speak for "most of us" at all. Do you even look at the most recent outing threads and check the exif data?
jews and retards go in the same oven retard.
Guess you're going in twice then
/pol/ is easily the most reddit board and they only took over other boards after the 2016 election tourists from Reddit came to /pol/
It's basically rural vs city niggers squaring off, it's a pretty common thing in real life and anytime they share the same hobby. They are basically incompatible with each other.
no. /k/ will heal after the conflict. /out/ is just a shit-fest of crybabies
You do know when someone points out in a group "a non complete but significant portion of this group is mentally crippled!", announcing that you are offended at being called a mental cripple, outs yourself as knowing that you are indeed one of the mental cripples, right?
Made me kek, nice one
As a rural day who lives in Philly currently I can say it’s not really those who come from the city that cause the most drama it’s the transplants from the suburbs. I’ve met plenty of nice niggers while fishing in the city and orentials that made me realize it’s just the white retards that make everything suck for most other people.
take your meds.
Nigga I don’t go on this board enough to want to reply to myself to bump the thread. Appreciate the trips but I don’t know how it could be a self reply unless my neighbor is also posting on /out/
Because your gay
every board belongs to /pol/
You gatekeeping redlt retards post the stupidist shit and spend most of your time crying about getting called out for being retarded.
Say it with me, idiots:
/out/ came long after /pol/ and only retards and reddlters monoboard.
Fun fact: Reddlt used to be good. It didn't last long though. The election tourists were a boon and many got deprogramed on /pol/ or redpilled enough to ease up on sucking trumps dick.
The problem was the tranny brigade that followed them to /pol/,relentlessly posting libcuck spam and 80iq hot garbage.
The seething libcucks are the cancer.
Baded
It was all downhill after they shutdown r/CoonTown. Reddit is still a good source for some things, and the “Reddit bad” meme is purely political. The backpacking subs are mostly just photos now though, which is ok I guess, but not something I’m interested in. r/ultralight has some good content but is a serious Tarp Tent circle jerk (or it was a few years ago; it was really, really bad).
Imagine thinking you aren't just a person I made up to argue with. I also made you ugly and stupid so I wont hold it against you,
Your lack of self awareness is truly astounding.
I knew you would say that, you poor ugly bastard
This is how men comunicate on the internet, even more in 4chan ... 
if you can't take it leave it fag 
/out/ is good af kys
post your hrt titties make em jiggle for me
the problem with this board is there is no janny so any moderation gets done by jannies from boards like origami and papercraft who have no clue what or the fuck is going on here and "off topic" is against the rules. so if you do any amount of posting on this board you catch perpetual bans for 3 month old posts. which leads to this board never keeping long term regular posters. over time most anons wind up fucking off or exclusively coming here to troll and bait.
dude what?
i made a post in there a while ago saying i live in the seattle area and i wanna take my dad fishing before he croaks, asked where around here i should go fishing and what kit i should buy because i don't know anything i haven't gone fishing since i was a teenager. and it got no replies or just some troll shit.
oh yeah i remember now, 1 reply calling me a cityfag or something (i don't live there, its just the closest major landmark)
Nailed it.
all these imageboards were horrible things from the beginning. every old /b/tard killed themself or is a tranny. moot's mother is a glownigger, 420chan cp board, etc etc. anyone who knows this site's history doesn't need to be told i'm preaching to the choir. but most users don't know the history. we're all participants in the modern version of the hippie movement, also brought to you by glowniggers. this time it was about getting millenials and zoomers to all do drugs and take sex change hormones. enjoy the ride!
From the perspective of a life-long angler, fishing general is a sorry-ass joke. I hope you and pops had some good times before he passed.
its been a death cult from the beginning lol
heres the guy who started modern internet culture, the modern conception of memes etc, he ended his life with no suicide note after beating his wife
hes still got like a year or two i wanna go fishing this summer nigger
wtf are you talking about man?
I feel more of an influx of tourists, than /pol/tards specifically. Feel like 2016 and 2020 each brought in a fuckton more tourists to /pol/, who then infected every other board with their retarded behavior once election shit ended and they searched for new shit to yell about. 
Now it's people trying to constantly one-up each other or establish themselves as the authority of /out/, instead of just chilling. Depressing.
/a/ was always here
Checks out. I will agree though that /out/ is actually usable.
anyone who complains about muh /pol/ is outing themselves at a redditor
That and unironically being into ultralight are two of the biggest giveaways desu
Its hippies 
The most anger comes from the 'appeal to nature' crowd
The discussion is fine until somebody says they prefer synthetic fabrics, or someone sprays weeds or they eat processed food.or god forbid, you have a lawn or think gmos are not deadly poison
Then it's fucking on
Your a jew, kill yourself, namecalling, speculating about your mental state 
And just garbage teir arguments
Appeal to nature has become a religion
And the board is full of zealots
Every single board on this shithole is like this
/trv/ is about how travel is worthless and shit, unless you are a sex tourist
/lit/ is about how what you read is shit
/int/ is about how your country is shit
/biz/ is about how it's time to commit suicide because it's over, as well as scams to take your money
then there's /pol/ which takes a stinking dump over every other board and fills it full of schizoshit, DA JOOS, and le edgy doomer, blackpill memes from 2015
A few posts above this one some faggot stated that anyone who’s “into ultralight” is from Reddit. In reality, anyone who’s done a lot of hiking eventually looked into making their hikes more comfortable, and understood why a lighter pack is a good idea. It’s a great example of peak newfag outing himself as such with a worn out, tiresome opinion.
Autistically weighing every item you put into your backpack is peak Reddit. Autistically creating spreadsheets and pie charts for your gear and calorie intake is peak Reddit. 
Ultralight trailhiking fags like you should go back to where you'll find more of an audience for your casual, normie-tier recreation activities.
See what I mean? Peak newfaggot.
&lt;recreation activities
LARP harder, newfag
All hiking is casual with no barrier to entry. That's why you see way more casuals hiking than rock climbing, mountain biking, scuba diving, hunting, bushcrafting, and other activities that require technical skill and sometimes licenses/certifications. 
Ultralight is just being autistic and obnoxious about an activity that any non-crippled retard can do. At least normie hikers on Facebook and Instagram realize what they're doing isn't special and just want to have an enjoyable experience. Nothing wrong with that. That's more than you can say about UL faggots.
All hiking is casual
Triples down. The sad part is /out/ is crawling with newfags like this. 
lol
LMAO
UL fags are every bit as ignorant as they are arrogant. What more proof does this board need?
Like a child at a drag show
Or a crack hit in a playground
You better fuckin be down 
Or pack your shit and go
Preach
The difference is people actually attempt long hikes, while “having the necessary skills to survive in the wilderness” is primarily larping.
Ok, so basically your entire knowledge of bushcrafting is based on passing by some kid's makeshift fort one time. Got it.
just getting TIRED of all the literal copy/pasting of past threads with sections edited out hoping for a GOLDEN MEME filled thread they can sell on REDDIT, QUASIMODO, and other sites/services/apps.
jannies all over 4chan and 4channel ALL make use of copy/paste posts HOPING for a different take for their preferred postings, and allowing newestfags and shit to post bomb the site into oblivion again and again.
love how the MODS and Jannies LOVE to use 4chan in their job resumes and shit. actually encountered one in a community college, PROUD and WHIPPING HIS BABY DICK AROUND about it. Lots of regular guys/gals avoiding him and/or patting him on the back hoping he doesn't go school shooter.
he also LOVED to use the KEYWORD he was told to use, DISINGENUOUS, believes it causes glowies to get hardons for his dick and save him money for bar hopping.
nowadays you just gotta hop around, try to shift through the waste, give good posts, and laugh at the weasles and tryhard trolls, mods or tryhard betamax mods.
Also thank god vanlife is trending less now, vans are getting cheaper and such. Tents and shit still overpriced thanks to port fuckery, politics, and people trying to get next quarter record profits yet again.
Those children are the apotheosis of bushcraft. Your entire knowledge of hiking is from boomers you saw at a trail head. Got it.
It’s like saying running isn’t a real sport because it doesn’t involve a ball, there isn’t a huge set of rules, you don’t need a ref, and the sport is defined by the 2 mile gun run in your local park. Meanwhile people on forums are getting in touch with other ultramarathoners and people who run 25k’s ever weekend. But your pickup game of basketball is way more hardcore.
people stacking rocks doesn't help anyone, themselves included usually,
everyone chopping down green trees, getting mad when they can't burn the tree right then and there, steal/borrow dried wood and then get drunk/high/fuck, party, throw bottles everywhere and fuck off into the morning light trying to skip paying for fucking up the camp site/location.
thats the first thing most campgrounds/farmers/landowners experience.
then there's the kid/guy/internet wise guy who keeps seeing "how to survive in the wilderness without a tent, tools, anything but a rock, some string/rope/ducktape and your wits" guys who end up wrecking an area, because they didn't want to buy a cheap 20 dollar tent, weather proof it and just throw a cheap camo wrap around it for the season to stealth it, while never thinking that having a fire is easily the fastest way for anyone with a working nose, eyes, ears, and a dog to find them without fail.
keep an eye out for these, wilderness survival huts, lots of them leave them standing, means you can come back in a week or three in dry weather and have a nice supply of firewood no one else is touching to have your campfires with.
filter your water, its the second easiest way to get water, first is the old waterpills method(take container, bandana to keep mud out, fill with water, put waterpill/treatment in, shake, wait suggested time, DRINK.
FIlter, more expensive BUT, depending on the type, you get your water NOW and/or after a couple minutes(several gallons gravity filtered NICE for setting up your site and having freshly filtered, cold water)
Just don't forget your salt/sugar/spices and you are golden.
cotton to cool off/stay cool while sweatin. wool for staying warm when cold/somewhat wet. Just don't believe you don't stink.
liners for your sleeping bags equals clean bags after you get your messy ass in them all the time and/or a lighter sleeping bag during hotter nights/days.
TExT WALLS!!
Gatekeeping outdoorsmen combined with an American/Euro schism as to what being an outdoorsman means.
Hiking fags have more in common with marathon running fags than they do with actual outdoorsmen. Come to think of it, /fit/ would be a better place for them to post than /out/
Bushcraft threads belong in /cgl/, or maybe /pw/ because it’s all make beleive.
to you maybe
okay
Conflict is the nature of the universe, pussy.
Gatekeeping outdoorsmen combined with an American/Euro schism as to what being an outdoorsman means.
Five minutes later:
It’s like pottery!
ITT: Everybody hates everybody, no exceptions.
I wouldn't have my /out/ any other way.
This miserable shitbag is right
I'm pretty moderate on all things /out/ related since I've been out in a lot of different places with a lot of different people.
I go trout fishing in streams for a whole week every summer. I don't wear galoshes or gators I just take my shoes off everytime I cross or wade into a stream. Sometimes I leave them off all day because I mostly fish in cow pastures and the thistles barely tickle through my calluses.
Do whatever makes sense to you. The friends I go fishing with always wear gators and they think I'm crazy. To each his own.
Before anyone asks I've never had ringworm or injuries, if anything I have more trouble with ingrown toenails when I wear wet shoes or waterproof boots that don't let my feet breath. Your own experience will probably be different than mine, I'm not sharing opinions just facts.
Frankly, the whole site never recovered from the barrage of shit that started in 2013 and the new owner doesn't care at all.
Disconnect your router and take your meds, schizo
every board on 4chan is like this. Also Rogan is a shill and you need to start watching better commentators
high test
My waterproofed shoes are called feet
Truth sayers. 
It's fun knowing I'm not the only one who vandalises the rare LGBT vehicle in the trail parking lots though.
Isn’t it odd how everyone with a lot of experience comes close to the same conclusion, or at least has a working knowledge of why other people do or prefer things a certain way? Those without recommend waterproof socks or something equally ridiculous.
Suggesting neoprene socks isn't ridiculous at all, newfag to the outdoors
4chan has always been a strong willed board to prevent cultutal subversion taking over the board. This is the biggest reason for isms here.
Out has become consumer general. Theres very little content, just questions about boots and best out chic fashion over and over and over again. It doesnt even matter what you say in the threads either because people will post their same reddit opinion in each one.
I dont think people go out anymore outside of alltrails follow the line.
I love that this guy larped his way into being an Indian. Wasn't he Italian or some shit? Hilarious.
Is being an asshole the only way you get people to engage with you? How lonely.
Welcome to 4channel, newfren. Hope you enjoy your stay.
post tits
Calling anons out for being edgy faglords isn't popular with women, anon. They're all about calling people incels now.
Yeah, just let your feet stew in their own sweat for an entire day while hiking 10 or 15 miles. It’ll be fine. Literally everyone does this. Wool socks are a meme.
Neoprene socks are superior to wool for keeping your feet dry for creek crossings. Isn't that what this discussion is about?
https://www.gearassistant.com/neoprene-socks-for-hiking/
not the guy you're responding to, but post nose then
nta but show us your anime doll collection
Unfettered stupidity.
Because people who go outside can't access 4chan. So this channel is full of people who wished they could go /out/.
Because people are anathema to outdoors
People create indoors and erase outdoors
If you are outside theres that much less outside for me
/x/ is the gayest and worst
Unironically this, the internet is smaller and smaller. Where can you really say what you think, without getting banned or down voted? There isn't much left except for chans.
Also tourists that never post OG.
Why did you take this picture? Was it to prove you make coffee outside?
You are the guy OP is talking about.
Ok. That doesn’t explain the picture.
I can live with that.
You can actually see this in this very thread:
Kek. Every other board is you guys throwing endless piles of shit at us and you can’t take a little ribbing here? Buncha fucking crybabies.
The lack of self awareness is truly mind boggling.
I didn’t ask why he posted it, he asked why he took it.
This is the impression I get as well.
This board needs a /gear/ containment thread because those threads account for at least 90% of the fighting here. See >>2560605 → for a prime example.
there really isnt anything else to discuss besides gear
/out/ exists in a medium antithetical to the nature of /out/, leading to an identity crisis and feral angst among the users here.
Show me a board that isn't like this
Not quite true. Some examples from the catalog.
it's part of the reason I only post like twice a year nowadays, most of the good discussions got fragmented a long time ago to different discord servers or you eventually find groups of real people instead of the wild amount of armchair enthusiasts on /out/. There's still some real solid posters but you'll be able to catch on and tell who shoots straight. 
Just don't get caught up in gear faggotry and get the fuck /out/, the cool gear and comfy pics will come in time if you want them to.
sad
I'm with OP, who are all these nasty people shitting up /out/?

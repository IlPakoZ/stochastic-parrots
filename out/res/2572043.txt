Why are people so concerned with survival, all you need to have is an axe and an lighter to kill everything which is nutritious or annoy you.
Do frog avatarfags ever go outside?
I have never seen outdoors OC in a frogspammer thread
Frog spammers have a mental illness and have no friends so they make bait threads to get attention.
just report, hide, and move on
imagine you get lost in a real wood, not your wood wood, i mean beaches so thick that you can sleep on one root. and then the snow starts to fall, and all you have is a Vulcan glass stone you found on a river (cause its the sharpest stone).
and then you have to grind the old evil tree down to not die on hypothermia, while simultaneous holding the balance in its old root. but the skin of the beach is like stone.
what you guys do is a walk in a park.
Looks like the druggie containment thread went to the archive
i would also be lost in a real European wood but for your parks a axe is all it needs.
but the difference is i want to be their and learn it.
you don't even know how big a forest can grow go back and paddle in your private pool.
real European wood
Huh?
They're fucking stupid

Hello,
How would I go about replanting this pathos plant? I tried cutting it off and replanting a ~8inch stem in soil. (You can see where I did it at the end, it has since grown more over three months) The old end cutting died, so this is my last chance probably. Thank you,
a way you can clone and propagate them by stem is to
cut a piece of vine with approximately 4-5 nodes
remove the lower leaves where you'll be rooting
submerge the parts of the stem you want to root
make sure no leaves make contact with the water because they'll quickly start to rot
change water once a week until nicely rooted
then transfer to pot as usual
if you wanna do it in soil, it's a bit trickier and you'll probably need rooting powder or something
also a better place to go for this sort of thing is

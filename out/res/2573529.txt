Does anyone on /out/ shop for outdoor gear on AliExpress? I've found some real gems on here in the past but now I'm considering it for outdoor equipment and accessories. Any recommendations or pointers? What are your experiences /out/?
I saw a 100L pack for fifty bucks and I'm not sure if it's legit or like when you go to McDonald's and they have those photoshopped pictures of burgers on the menu but what you get is much more realistic for what you pay for
I think if a deal seems too good to be true, there's probably something up, but a lot of goods are not that expensive and work just fine for what they are. Some things you don't want to buy, then have it break easily to be replaced again, or even worse have it break while you are using it. There's a middle ground where you are getting a good deal but aren't getting ripped off just for the brand.
I’d be cautious of anything that’s designed around the human body; clothing, sleeping bags, quilts, tents… I’m 6” taller than the average Chinese. The stuff that fits them is simply too small for me, a normal height human male.
Someone posted an AliExpress shaped tarp in another thread and it was 230cm long on a side (it’s wider at the head end, so the ridge line is even shorter). That’s about 7.5’. Most tarps are closer to 9’.
I'm 6'2'' and could make do with a 7.5' tarp just fine honestly, but it would definitely be less expensive. I'm trying to use more bushcrafting for shelter which only costs time and labor, so I can do less spending/packing/shopping. Tarps, even smaller ones, are ideal for covering small hidden entrances to bushcraft like pit blinds or dugout shelters when camping. You can of course build a bushcraft shelter completely from local materials, but the tarp makes tents or shelters a lot easier.
You can also see the dimensions of the item before buying it, I could make use of a one of these cheaper tarps or a rolled bed mat, but for things like sleeping bags in freezing temperatures, you would want the right equipment.
were there any photos in the reviews?
Naturehike stuff from AliExpress seems to be well-reviewed by hiking YouTubers at a glance
naturehike tents are legit, i can attest to that. the designs are knockoffs of NA and euro brands but at a fraction of the cost and still well built with good materials.
Aliazon
I realize this is a Slovenian taxidermy forum, but try to have at least some standards
its the same gear as 80% of the shit on amazon
amazon
Also shit standards, but as you said if you know what brand or specific product you're looking for that has some quality, then it's fine. Same with aliexpress, certain things should be completely avoided.
Both websites are absolute trash. They exist because most people have shit taste and buy garbage products that don't last.
Depends on what you're buying, in general stick with products with lots of reviews. I wouldn't buy certain products on there like packs or boots, but stuff like tarps or basic stoves or solar panels, you can definitely get away with it.
I bought a wind screen for 10 euros and it seems good, but I have to try it yet bc I got it only for 4 days
I bought a Thermarest Xtherm sleeping pad on Amazon and it is great.
Fuck my local outdoor store I'm going to buy it off of amazon for $20 less and pay $20 in shipping and pretend I saved money.
I think it just depends. Loads of shit is just fine if it's the cheapest shit from China.
Ask yourself 
Does your life depend on it?
How fucked am I if this shit blows middle of a trip?
And I think that's about it. With a load of shit who cares. If it's rock climbing gear, do not cheap out.
If only this was true. Local stores usually sell good gear for like 50 bucks more minimum

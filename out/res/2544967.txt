Went on my first hike with a group on strangers I met on facebook. I hated it. Is this supposed to be more fun alone?
why did you hate it?
It's because they were strangers. Hiking with close friends is fun but for me hiking alone is the best experience. Everyone is different.
I used to hike alone fairly regularly. it was fun because i could go where io wanted to go, didn't have to worry about tother peoples schedules, or hiking pace, or anything.
hiking alone, at a brisk pace, i would pretend I was Strider, the wild and dangerous ranger from the north, on a special mission for the Elven Lords.
or i would pretend I was an agile wood elf, lightly travelling along making almost no noise, disturbing no woodland life and moving without strain or effort because of my wood natural elf abilities
Because they kept stopping for pictures and the girls would do cringy faces and poses every couple minutes. Also some people brought their dogs, and they wouldn't stop talking, it was horrible.
ok. yeah i wouldn't like that at all either. i would rather be hiking alone at that point.
I went for a five hour hike alone last week and saw one other person the entire time I was walking. it was bliss.
I ran a backpacking MeetUp group with over 120 members for a few years. Hiking with strangers is a completely different experience. If you’re not a “people person” then don’t do it. You have to really enjoy the company of others for it to be worth your while, as there are a lot of downsides.
I would hate it too.
IMAGINE needing the encouragement of a facebook group to go on a single(1) hike! Not reading this ngmi thread, just came here to laff at you.
that's literally not what the OP said, you dingelberry
This is why I don't plan on ever doing a guided mountaineering expedition. Having to be around strangers for an extended length of time sounds like hell to me when I am used to doing everything on my own terms. If this means that I'll never get to climb technical or higher altitude mountains, so be it.
If the talking gets to you (It gets to me as well) go by yourself. 
Really, you're not going to change some people.
i will go with you and i promise i'll march to the summit in complete silence
Sounds like it would be good to practice socializing.
This girl I like has been asking me to take her out on a hike and I really want to fuck her but don't know if her cooter will get too stinky after an hour of hiking. She's pretty easy to impress considering I took her out to a nearby river where I usually fish and she couldn't stop smiling and taking pictures like she's never seen a river before. I assume if I show her some elevation her pussy will get really wet and she'll be horny for some dick.
You don't need guides to climb difficult things. You just start with easier things and slowly work your way up as opposed to just paying someone to drag you up something hard with little experience.
No, you absolutely only can touch cooters less than 4 minutes 32 seconds after they've been washed, after that cooters become too stinky. If hiking, it will be more like 3 minutes 28 seconds. If she hasn't washed the cooter within that time period it will be too stinky. Even more so she's very easily impressable, which means the cooter will get wet and become stinky even sooner. So you'd have around 2 minutes 14 seconds to fuck the cooter before it's too stinky for you to fuck.
It absolutely could be, sure. The hikes we organized were loosely categorized by difficulty. On the easier hikes you’d have people of all age groups (though generally over 35) and walks of life. The longer or more difficult stuff was basically the same core group of maybe a dozen people, all somewhat younger. 
On a group hike people end up hiking in smaller groups or pairs, or alone, and just meeting up when everyone stops for a break. You can try to stay together, but it doesn’t really work out. I mean you’re not like miles apart, but you’re certainly not one mass of people either. You’ll definitely be socializing at camp, even if you’re not set up near each other (logistics don’t always work out for everyone to be right next to each other). 
But yeah, if you’re a socially awkward weirdo (you’re on 4Chan, so probably) I say go for it. If nothing else you can troll the group with your weirdness.
Is the last girl wearing adidas sneakers and yoga pants? What the fuck?
nah mate just belay yourself, just fifi onto each pice as you go up so you can use both hands to pay out more rope and redo your backup knot.
picrel me 35m up solo
Then why did he go in a group? Why did OP need to be in a group?
doesnt that require permanent anchors?
It's so that you can stare at her ass the whole way.
To a this board getting worse? 
yoga pants
Shorts and leggings are a great combination, especially when protection from abrasion isn’t needed (like on an established hiking trail). They keep you warm and dry very quickly. It’s basic athletic wear.
Pic
no
You wouldn't know.
Wouldn’t know what? That Adidas makes hiking shoes or that leggings are commonly used athletic wear? Because whoever commented on those things obviously didn’t know.
Feels good to have a capable bro along when you show up to the LZ in the dark and head into a deserted wilderness. 
We didn't see a single person on this run.
LARPer detected.
is there more to this story?
NGMI!
Honestly, people who don’t like people shouldn’t go outside, you should knit or play WOW. People are cool, they make things better, sounds like you missed out on making friends. You should do it again but pull the stick out of your ass first, if you need it back in there you can find a new one on your hike.mvxht2
okay
im in a hiking facebook group with a bunch of old ladies and its insanely based. just recently we snowshoed to an old fire lookout on a 4k elevation gain trail. was a blast.
did you blast inside the old ladies?
not yet, in due time
You mean RV? As in rendezvous? Unless you really did chopper in... in which case, tell us more?
yes, it is infinitely more fun alone
It's more fun with someone you enjoy being around and talking to. Alone is okay as well, but it can get lonely. I can't imagine why anyone would want to hike with a group of strangers though. Seems like it could go wrong in so many different ways.
You normally don't have to worry about smell unless you're doing it doggy style, then everything starts stinking if they haven't washed. My buddy used to use a finger swipe test and sniff his finger to see if it was worth going after. If it were me just tell her to hold on to a tree and hit it from behind, eating pussy onatrail is a pretty cuck move, fine if you're in the bed but not when you're manning up and leading the way.
You know I just remembered I got 2 blowjob's while hiking, one from an ex and one from my wife. Didn't cum cause they got scared after 2 minutes but lead to some good times afterwards
Do it with close friends or a dog and a gun
People literally go on these meetup and Facebook hikes to take pictures and socialize autismo. How do you think girls get their instagram and tinder pictures?
Send her my way and I'll fuck her stinky cooter without any care in the world.
why are you so obsessed by sex?
that's why I hike alone, for you hiking is just a medium to obtain sex
Essentially this. It really is true freedom when you can set your own pace, pick your own paths, and relax as much as youd like.xdsasr
Are these any good?
Okay, so you have like no fucking game so let me lay it out for you. 
you want to hike, but you have no one to hike with
Okay, but now
do what you did, join randoms via FB
Okay, but now
its horrible, because randoms. 
Okay, but now
Oh my gawd these tiktok oants make my butt looks sooooooo big. I hope a rich, unattached 6’8 chap is on our walk uwu
Literally the antithesis of why I /out/
Tbh you wouldn't know any of what you're trying to post about.
gigabased
10/10 retard bait post. Even type the captcha into the post.
Schizo
cope and seethe, goblin mutt
Don’t know. I’m just pointing out that the other guy is a fucking retard because those aren’t sneakers and “yoga pants” are great in cold weather.
Yes. And that's adequate equipment for a day hike is good weather.
I don't care that much to hike alone. I'd rather hike with my wife so we can chat and point stuff out to each other and discuss them
What's the biggest group you've done camping/backpacking in? I like camping alone but when there are several people and lots of booze it's a blast. Would it be fun to go camping in a group of 20 friends way into the woods or is that too much?
The point of us incels going hiking with Facebook groups is to possibly make a wife
In first year University, actually the second week there, we had a camping trip for Terrestrial Ecology (plus some other people), it was like 30-40 people that barely knew each other at some Cabin in the mountains owned by the University. Profs stayed inside while everyone tented in the woods.
It was a good time, lots of drinking and hiking.
and fucking
Now I feel bad for the women involved
If they’re a “person person” they should fuck off back to the pub instead of polluting peaceful nature. I hate tourists, noisy ones even more so. 
I go alone I see deer and hawks all day. If there’s people that’s the only thing there. They’re a plague.
Agreed
I'll look at Meetup hike listings occasionally, there's a high number of them within an hours drive. Most of the people are pretty old around here, in their 50s. Won't see many women under 30... One time I signed up early for a hike as a lark, and a Korean in her 20s signed up after me. She was too much of a vax'd normie for my taste, but it was flattering to know that you convinced someone to come for a hike. She let me give her a ride back to the train station and a hug...
Let 'em come to you, that's the right way.
I fucked my ex after a hike (she got extra sweaty) her cooch was full of cottage cheese and I ate it all. :(
So I went on my second hike to today and it was no different.
Safe to say I'm never doing this again. I'm on my own from this point forward.
Did you nut in any of them?
why would any self respecting man subject themselves to this?
Yikes.
I would just walk away if I had people in my group doing this.
Is that a fucking tripod on the left? Are these people doing a photoshoot in the middle of a hike? Jesus.
this x 6 million
holy shit
What about alpine ascents? I read everywhere I shouldn't cross a glacier without at least 2 other people roped up lest I fall in her deep deep crevasse.
In Spain they charge money on meetup plans. The one organizing it say you have to pay like 10€ for the "cost" of organizing it and acting as a guide. Also the younger person that goes to those plans is probably 40.
1. you dont have an ex-wife
2. you're almost definitely a virgin
3. if my some miracle im wrong and you were married, you're clearly a mongoloid because pussies dont get full of cottage cheese after a bit of hiking, they get ful of cheese because their owners are disgusting cunts who obviously dont wash.
I am replying to bait
if you go for a huke with facebook strangers it's ... to socialized.
if not, go alone; you'll go further.
yeah
What in the ESL
Lol, muh vertical tiktok video. I don't know how you resisted the urge to beat all 4 of them with the tripod. Please share the link where everyone posts their pictures and videos
not that anon but i'm finding this hard as i try to get into winter hiking. i could only go 3 times out this winter so far (it's been shit few months) but the learning curve is very steep and costly, all 3 expeditions were mostly failures. now i have crampons, i will go out again but i think the deep snow will fuck me again and i won't even reach the start of the steep part. breaking snow is so hard but i don't want to spend 100 more dollars in gear like skis or shoe rackets
unfathomably based... I kneel
Find normal people to hike with. They are out there. Avoid city women.
If you don't want to chat, why choose a group?
Old hiking hippy ladies are pure kino and very unappreciated
Are they good for a midnight romp in the tent?
Me suena basado, francamente
How could they not be? Fit and no chance of getting pregnant. It's the best of all worlds anon
Imagine if she found you wrote this how emotionally broken she would be in case she was genuinely happy to be with u and at the river. Damn nigger
I bring a tripod backpacking so that I can take Milky Way photos. If you're into landscapes or wildlife it's fine, but I have no reason to defend these iphone instathots.
I am sorry you had to endure this. If you can tolerate the group, try to find any non-shitty people in the group and break off into a separate group with them. Women may be intimidated by this, but you might meet like-minded men to be friends with.
the smell
Cuck
Smells like heaven Tbh
Why deal with facebergsteins when you could just bring a frend or two.
I dont have friends anon...
This ain't a normie board.
You know where there's even less people? In your room. 
Stay inside you autistic faggot.
It really is. Neets are too afraid to leave their comfort zones. There's loads of normies on this board, since they don't let their anxiety and depression stop them from going outside, unlike neets.
Don't let being spergy stop you from making friends broham. Some of my favorite people are a bit kooky. Better weird than having an npc worldview.
Ima pretend you dint just call me normal, fagget
Lots of neets go outside and have more time for outdoor activities than wageslaves you hopeless retard
Sub-nigger IQ comment. Kys for the betterment of humanity.
Yes. Autism.
Why is there an ammo box to the right?
Who the fuck brings an ammo box hiking?
Going by the context of the photo, there probably a summit register stored in that box
Kek. You guys don't climb with a full box of 7.62x51 real fkn nato? Ngmi
Too bad they don't have any money for it
Did you bang?
Anons, do you think it's worth paying money for a guided hike to a 100+ foot waterfall on private land? Or should I be like the college kids in the area who just trespass there to party and litter (without the partying and littering part)? It's $20 for a group hike and $100 for a private guided tour. I'm more than capable of reaching the waterfall on my own. I just don't want to get caught and cited for trespassing.
Nobody gets to own a 100' waterfall. Do it, trespass. Fuck boomers.
He's right tho
Advice for life
If she's a true 6/10 or above she won't stink. If literally anything makes her a 5/10 or under she can stink. Every beautiful women I've been with has smelled amazing and isn't a ding ding and will take care of themselves.
Unless you're a dingle yourself you know when they naturally can't help it. If a chick or even you yourself comes back from the gym yeah you're not gonna smell the best. But I have a feeling you're talking about girls that straight up don't wash their bodies, that's a 5/10 at best and you can tell by their personalities or looks. It's honestly simple as that. 
For reference 6/10 is the majority of cute girls. They're wifey material potentially. 5/10's are girls who don't fix their teeth, weight, acne etc. Nothing necessary wrong with it but you're average at best at that point ya dig?
It's a box of condoms
You went on a hike with talking dogs?
Hike ruined.
This. I've done 27 miles without seeing a soul outside of our group (of frens, not strangers from the internet).
I wonder how many people thought that while I was spying on them? pic related. Next time you think you're alone take out your camera and turn up the settings and take 360 degree pics. Then look carefully at home.
The best way to ruin and outdoors experience is to bring other people
it's a stereotype for a reason. When I go skiing with my sisters, they probably take upwards of 10 pictures/snapchats through the trip, either of themselves or the scenery
Fucking this
When I go up my favorite trail, I always keep an ear out for chatter so I can go off the trail or hide before I see anyone, just so I can avoid any kind of interaction
no one sneaks up on a Ranger from the North
I have a bike in dire need of a top end rebuild. I'm not sneaking up on anyone.
Nothing wrong with taking pictures when you go /out/. It would just be annoying if everyone in the group does it and you have to stop every 5 seconds.
Did you fuck the one in the middle?
How do you hike alone? I live in eastern europe and i wish i would hike more often but i feel like alone is too dangerous. One bad encounter with a bear or a wolf and thats it.
Look Benny I don't care about your cooter stink theory, just hand over the platinum chip
Let me guess, girls ware with boyfriends and maybe even fucked at night and you are single
Id felt bad too
Yes. Going with people ruins immersion. Also “hiking groups” are full of social media normies that care more about updating their snapchat/facebook/twitter profiles for updoots rather than actually enjoying the hiking experience. That being said, make sure you go prepared and you’ll really enjoy it.
You can't make this stuff up.
shorts and a down jacket oh lawd
Anime website, lost r*ddit tourist. Also 2D women>trashy 3D women.
this guy fucks
also this, there is no hope for your future together
No but it does require you to do every bit of ascent about twice
Feelin' lucky?
I took a female friend hiking with me once. Big mistake. Ended up having to cut the trip short and I missed out on a few spots I wanted to hit because we spent like 3 hours making out and fucking.
The correct action to take here when you see that rock is to look at it and think to yourself "I could shelter under that if it rains" and then carry on, never to think of the rock again.
She's going to stink after hiking. Just don't go at it from behind after you're done hiking and you'll be fine. If you behind her over and spread her, you'll get the full smell of the holding tank on a crab boat. Pretty easy to avoid.
cringe, but also based and now I'm gonna do this
love from Kazakhstan
been trying to invite my "friends" and they just ignore my messages or don't answer calls
lol
;_;
adding to ths
I have the week off work and all I've done is watch youtube videos of people going /out/
why couldn't I have been born a normalfag
just go out alone, stop dreaming, start doing
i tried just now there are so many people everywhere already and my anxiety goes up im just gonna kill myself
you sound like a faggot
The chance of a wolf or a bear fucking with you is basically zero. Carry bear spray if you're that worried about it.
Crazy, that female has attracted two orbiting bodies
How many of those people did you judge or remember as much as you believe they're going to judge or remember you?
Anon...
Sometimes I wonder how many times ive had a gun trained on me out in the woods. Im decently aware of my surroundings, but past certain distances how am I even supposed to know.
Posters like you are what makes this board so fucking good
hike at night bro.
You can hate idiots without being a misanthrope. The worst is when some idiot constantly complains about his feet hurting because he just bought new shoes.
Hey at least you tried, partying up with randos to any activity is always a hit or miss. Just do some solo hikes, maybe ask that facebook group about other good trails to check out. Maybe someone from that group will be more like you and also prefer to hike without the stopping, talking and dogs.
I want to start doing overnight hiking - what do I need for this? obviously water, snacks, and a tent... but where the hell can I pitch my tent? just anywhere?
in the woods, preferably in a national park or national forest, or state forest or even a county park. preferably inna woods and preferably near a fresh water source like a river or strong running creek, or stream, tributary, rivulet or the like

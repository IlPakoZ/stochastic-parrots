I have never had a quality folding knife so i dont know anything about them. Can somebody tell me what i should look for so i dont accidentally buy some tacticool mall ninja shit that market is flooded with. Are there some designs that are just better and more robust? What brands make good stuff?
IMHO, a lot of regular folding knives can do the job for hiking, since you wont be using them for batoning and other shit that is reserved for knives. If you're looking for a good, quality, and robust pocket knife, just go with either a Victorinox (anything from a Spartan to a Swisschamp) or a Buck 110. Those are really good for anything from EDC to Bushcraft/Carving.
Just buy an opinel
Depends on a lot of sheeeiiiit. Don't let pricks come and tell you to buy over priced "supersteel" fidget spinners.
Opinel (No.8 Carbon/stainless is lightweight and affordable, they have many models)
OKC RAT 1 and 2 
Victorinox Huntsman is amazing, but they have other models depending on your shit.
ignore all fags before and after this post and buy a cold steel folder 
/thread
Don't waste your money on folders. Standing knives are safer.
T.accidentally lacerate themselves
Dumb shit happens to dumb people. Do not play around with your knife.
Especially opinel knives are a really dumb idea.
If you're looking for larp knives ask /k/
Get a buck hunting knife and a mora companion for out. Companion fits in my pocket without showing.
Opinel 6"
You can't go wrong with one or two of those.
opinel is overrated as fuck unless you're mostly cutting cheese and opening packages when you go /out/. no idea why anyone would want a folder over a fixed blade
This anon is correct.
Benchmade bugout is everything you need
no idea why anyone would want a folder over a fixed blade
No idea why you wouldn't have both. Folder stays in your pocket permanently and is there when you need it, while the fixed goes on your belt when you're performing a task that requires it.
buying coldsteel in 2023.
After Lynn sold the business, quality went down and price went up, we don't get the sweet videos Lynn would make. 
If ppl don't know about cold steel videos, literally go watch cold steel demos, shit is hilarious.
Quality went down, huh? I have CS knives from 1995 and 2022, and I don't see any decrease in quality. I put my new CS knives through the grinder and they're tougher than any bitchmade I own, and I own a few,
For me, it's Spyderco
Are those fish okay?
Buck 112
Yeah, after some butter and some lemon pepper they were just fine.
just get a Chinese replica of a benchmade osborne or something. 90% of the difference between it and the real thing is the steel. and the steel is okay/not bad
Okay, I was slightly worried for them.
I would recommend a CRKT. they are cheap enough that you can afford it and use it hard without feeling bad about it, but good enough quality that youll get alot of utility out of it, especially the M-16-140, it's a great "jack of all trades" knife
110
There ARE strong standouts when it comes to locking knives.
Frame locks and liner locks are the most durable, and easy to use despite some people griping about them
For steel its more like pick a type that seems ok and see what prices you can find for them and in what shapes.
You can find people comparing the steel types as well as various models.
I went looking, figured I wanted a strong locking style, looked through steels and decided I wanted something fancy and was willing to shell out for m390, knew what sort of shape I didn't want, and went from there.
But you can get quality for a lot less.
Spydershit makes good stuff but also a shit ton of mallninja shit, and I despise the blade shape. (Just never liked leaf shaped knives.)
Buck, Gerber, a lot of big name brands do make good stuff, though dunno on their prices.
I went and found some italian company making fancy flippers that had everything I wanted ergonomically and spec wise, but I easily could have gotten good shit from the mainstream.
The first thing you do when you want a purchase recommendation for a tool is to state what you want to use it for.
You can get a $100 G10 powder steel tank that can do almost everything of course, but that would be a waste of money and a heavy bulge in your pocket when you're just opening packages. 
The grind and the thickness of a blade are also a factor so please state what the use case is.
My personal rule of thumb is that if you don't know what steel you need, 440C is fine.
Ah yes I just love to have half a pound of metal resting at the bottom of my pocket.
Belt pouch? That's what I've done for years
giant hole in the blade
Man, those things look just like the tiny keychain knives they sell at the gas station in a big plastic jar for $1.
Little fixed blade in kydex sheath sitting horizontal on the belt is still patrician choice.
t. carries a subcompact polymer .380 because metal is "too heavy"
can recommend firefighter knives
User error.
No it's not, Bepis, that's just autistic. If you're gonna carry a fixed blade, at least carry like an esee 4.
great taste with the dragon. do you have a crawford kasper folder? it's my favorite pocket knife so i have collected about ten, given away around that many as gifts, i wish crkt would remake them with better steel.
buy opinel no 8 carbon
If you're not survivalfag just buy victorinox/opinel and a folding saw or axe, you won't ever need to baton with your knife
Cold Steel Code 4 is probably the best folder. Its thin, best lock available on market, good steel and alu handles and good price.
I had one but I always liked the fixed blades so I gave it to ma father. If I had to buy folder today I would go for Code 4 again.
looks somewaht grandpa farty tier
This version of the N°12 Explore comes with a tick remover in the knife handle, so you can get rid of ticks safely and effectively.
Shit knife loved by retards who work in factories and only used to open boxes.
Not a bad option for much of/out/
The Buck 113 is the most under rated knife. It thrives on abuse and the price point for the quality can't be beat. The sheath is shit thought. Benchmade steep country or hidden canyon are fantastic if you aren't poor.
Folders are a meme, get a spyderco folder like everyone else.
It's popular BECAUSE that's all the people who buy it do with it.
Belt knifes are a meme. They get in your way just moving around and you can't use them with pack straps. The most involved task for a field knife is skinning and those knives are around 7 inches and no one that hunts hip carries them. You also wash them before sheathing so there is no speed or convenience gain to the hip carry--which also messes up your clothing.
A QSP Neckmuck is going to absolutely crush all folders in every metric that matters.
It depends on the heat treat. Buck 420hc is better than 99% of Chinese stainless regardless of type because of how they heat treat.
So where do you put your fixed blade while you're working with it if not your belt? Do you just throw it on the ground? Jam it in your back pocket?
Cleaning fish and game with a folder
You boomers I swear. My dad can't carry his folder because it smells awful from cleaning fish and crab with it. Folders are hard as fuck to get offal out of and most people I've ever see use them for fish keep them in the boat (defeating the purpose of having a folder) because, again, they are almost impossible to get the stink of--especially if you use them regularly.
CPM S35VN steel was created in 2009 as a collaboration between South African-American knife maker Chris Reeve and Crucible Industries, a steel manufacturer based in New York.
The oy vay of steel. Higher price for a 2% increase in plasticity over S30v and indistinguishable properties from D2 for most people that use it.
Its also a shit idea to buy a super steel blade if you don't know how to sharpen. Truthfully you need a diamond block if you don't want to spend an hour getting a super steel blade sharp.
Depends. I usually have a day pack. It also fits fine in my jacket or pants pocket. The out pants I wear usually (when i don't have a day pack) have a hammer pocket on the leg.
I also have an old satchel I use when foraging of fishing.
The diamond system is better for super steel blades. Super steel absolutely wreaks traditional stones. The Lanksy system sucks for straight blades and long blades.

Man, those things look just like the tiny keychain knives they sell at the gas station
Same about your tiny multitools. What you gonna do with them? Pluck your eyebrows?
I have that same mini multitool (Micra). It is the only knife you need in most cases. Its perfect for a med kit, field repair, camp cooking, fishing and clipping finger and toe nails. You cant beat it for vanilla backpacking. I have a benchmade hidden canyon and it only comes out to gut and skin...you literally can do almost every other camp task with a micra.
My nigga. I own 3 and gifted 5 more to friends and family over the years.
Your dad could have prevented that by regularly cleaning his knife after use.
Exactly. A knife is mostly just for food. I use a pair of kids scissors with a round tip and sheath and it handles like 99 percent of shit you would use a knife for. I also scored a Gil ten utility knife made from polycarbonate or some shit that weighs damn near nothing and costs like 4 bucks. Between those three things it’s all you need and has endless utility with minimal weight.
lol
yes, fish guts buildup can be hozed off. Boomers don't keep a tooth brush in their boat to clean a knife. He'll, they don't even keep one in the kitchen to clean.
I need to see your loocense for those scissors mate.
Folding knife is a tacticool larp tool. There’s no reason to carry a folding knife when you could be carrying around a mora-styled knife.
This is like asking which backpack to buy
or tarp vs tent
or which clothing to buy / take on your trip
so many things to decide
fixed vs folded?
length and blade width?
how light do you pack?
how long are your trips?
price?
and then the steel
something cheap like 420 or 1095 -> easy sharpening on the go
or more corrosion resistance with M390
or with better edge retention like CPM-S90V or CPM-M4
though for you typical weekend /out/ trip just take some stainless steel mid length fixed blade
lowest amount of maintenance and cheap
Keep it simple. Flat grind, thin handle and decent steel. Like most of Spyderco's simple models. You get a lot of knife for $100-200.

Do you have girl pockets or something?

Goes on to answer the question
You go issues..
The Grand Daddy of production folders is probably Opinel--who hasn't improved anything in 100 years. The iconic look of modern folders arguably was established by Buck with the Buck 110 and although not a folder Bowie deserves an honorable mention as Opinel AND Buck lifted blade design elements from the Bowie knife...
Note--Bowie came out in 1838 and Opinel didn't start making blades for another 40 years or so.

Gives advice on knives
I spent more than $80 on a knife because I will own and use it for 30 years or more like everyone else in my family. If you're making a life time investment or even a long term one quality isn't cheap. The better a blade material the more expensive the knife because harder material is much more expensive to process. Cheap Chinese blades use inferior metals and shit heat treat that leads to easily broken blades.
I love Victorinox but they are taking a really weird path with what used to be the Hunter Pro series.
It bothers me because they rarely do innovative stuff and when they do, they ride the horse until its dead and burried. Or they do retarded shit like the off white collab or that massively overpriced Replika one. Meanwhile they cancel actual cool shit like the old Safari series, the old green Hunter or the slide locks.

They have rounded tips with a sheath. It would be like trying to stab a man with your pinky, it just won’t work. Also I meant Gil-tek not Gil ten or whatever the hell else came out
Geeze, Louise, what are they doing? There are 4 or 5 of my favs in there.
Cleaning up some room for new models perhaps? It must be a logistic nightmare to keep up with so many different niche models when only the most popular ones actually sells.
Damn, now I have to get a Hercules while I still can. Deluxe Tinker is my everyday knife and I always wanted it one size up. 
Quite a few classics on there, if those where purged for shit like the Evoke they are really taking a weird direction. I guess the Elseners are getting old.

Ranger camping
Waaaiiittt, whatthefuck, nigger?! Stop!! The Ranger's my favorite model.
Better get them while you still can.
Is that actually selling? Victorinox is for multiools, not single bladed knives. for the same price as that thing you can probably get a spyderco in at least VG10 instead of vic's 1.4110
I already have one. But looks like I now need to have another one.
Victorinox is for Europeans and children who don't know any better.
They are notoriously lethargic with line-up developments. It took something like 20 years of petitioning to put scissors on the Pioneer. This is pretty remarkable news, IMO.
I had a benchmade grizzly ridge as my edc for 4 years and I absolutely fucking loved that knife. I only needed to sharpen in roughly once or twice a year and that's only because I like to keep my knives razor sharp. I lost it back last year while /out/, tried to go back and find it but it was gone for good...
Anyway, when it comes to quality folders, I'd say work your way up from a solid baseline while your career / spending amount can handle it. 
I started with Kershaw as my first "nice" knives, and bet your ass they were nice, they just lost their edge fast and I was a retard who didn't know how to really sharpen back then. After that it was Spyderco, I did the Endura 4 or whatever the bigger one is, and since I lost my Benchmade I've been using that as an edc and frankly it's more than enough.
Benchmade is honestly a gearfag flex, the quality differences are subtle but noticable, but not worth the price if you're stuggling to afford it. I still haven't replaced mine yet and it's been just about a year since I lost it. 
I think Spyderco is pretty based for the price.
People will have to buy two tools to have their needs covered so you get more sales. Bussiness as usual.
I doubt that's their reasoning. If it was, they wouldn't make stuff like the Swisschamp or XLT.
lol this, its incredible how much better I feel about any type of purchase when the product isn't made in china.
Benchmade Griptilian. Good luck getting one though. Sad they discontinued custom ones last I checked. For what it's worth benchmade makes some other great knives that are more affordable.
These are actually pretty decent for carving/finer work because of the blade shape.
Exactly. A knife is mostly just for food.
The last thing you want to cut food with is a pocket knife, it will rust in no time from the acid baths of veggies. You use fixed specific blades for food, a pocket knife is more so for cutting multiple different materials. 
posting a sponsor list
When you know a quality product, you're the sponsor of the product you love.
You could have posted just the picture and that would have been enough to get a sense of the formless geomacing of chinaman design both in the knife and the naming of their products. Give it a nice 1000 grit sanding and polish on that horrendous handle like they should have done and you'll have yourself a good glovebox backup of a knife
Have you ever see those gifs of people taking china rebar and breaking it by hand? And they wouldn't do this with bulk discount knives why? The only metallurgic knowledge china has is the one that they steal from other countries and synthesis a shit version together. The only good steel they have is either from new mines or imported, their mentality still hasn't evolved from "the great leap forward" and they still try to pawn off leftovers of their shit pig iron into mixes. If you're so hellbent on not purchasing a USA made product then there are plenty of other countries available that actually know how to temper steel.

I bought an Opinel No.7 on a recommendation. Used it to clean out 3 rabbits and could never use it again. The wood swelled and the blood made the pivot rust into oblivion. I have another one for around the garden and it's great for that but I would never take one /out/ again.
never ever clean game with a folder unless it's a survival emergency. I see idiot boomers do this and their knifes smell like shit and are loaded with germs.
Non meme skinning knives avoid any edge or cranny that offal can build up in. You don't want jimping or a fancy handle.
The Buck 113 is almost perfect but they put a lanyard hole on it for some retard reason. White river M1 is another good example.
I'm glad there's a thread for this, I had the same question.
A few months ago I got a Svord peasant knife, it opens on friction with a nice lever on the other end.
The handle is nicely shaped, it's sturdy, and the knife itself is literally razor sharp and hardy as hell, it's a real great nice, especially at thirty bucks. The only problem is deploying it takes much longer than I might need if it was very urgent, say if I was held at gunpoint by a mountain lion.
Anybody got another good, sharp, hardy folding knife that folds but can be deployed quickly? Automatic, wave, flip, I'm not too worried about it.
Yay the thread i was waiting for
Doesn't read it
Anon, I dunno what knife would be best for you specifically, but the one that I use is the gerber ayako flipper knife. quick to pull out, easy to sharpen, brass washers so self lubricating, frame lock too. best knife I have had so far.

I've been a fan for a long time but when I heard there were "mistakes" with blade steel, that was the straw that broke the camel's back. My own experiences only came down to cosmetic problems, but there was a video on YT of them subbing A2 for CPM154 on a run, and I kind of just lost interest.
Mini Fox River is the one I'd rec from my whole collection.
cosmetic problems
And I mean the grind on a lot(75%) of the 3V knives I ordered from them had a super steep secondary bevel. It's a matter of a few hours at a bench stone to fix, but still annoying when it happens. Most (95%) of the A2 knives I got were perfect.
Yeah. Entirely subjective, easily remedied "problems."

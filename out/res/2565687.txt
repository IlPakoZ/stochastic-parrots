Why does the trillion-dollar outdoor gear industrio-media complex promote wilderness eye-rape?
it's so that the rescue helicopter could easily spot the normies that called them with their inReach
Useful in winter for sure but I had a lot of views and pictures ruined by rainbow faggots.
It's so that you can't hide.
The flying zogbots WILL find you in your brightly colored tent and you WILL be returned to your pod
i have a bright orange tent that was 30% off because nobody was buying that color, idgaf if you dont like it. my tent is a very clear "this is my spot, fuck off" for literally everyone to see.
the same principle applies to people who need to have olive drab everything, you arent hiding from anyone, we can still see you. im not there to LARP as an army ranger pretending to "bug out" 50' off the trail where everyone just awkwardly passes knowing full well youre there underneath some camo tarp monstrosity
so people can spot me from miles away why else
I saw a guy wearing camo once that means camo is a larp
Hillebergs are so sexy fuck
Lots of people don't see me just wearing browns and some grey.
Honestly dude, it sounds like you have a bright orange tent because it suits your clown-ass mental disorder.
getting this mad about a stuck pixel on your 2009 DSLR
We see you. We just don’t make eye contact and pretend you’re not there because you look like a fucking weirdo.
seethe
Red tents ruin landscape photographes. 
Its a good faggot deterent. Brown and grey is normal where I live. Just stay in the city if you are so sensitive.
I don't see a tent
Left of the two lakes, right in between
would be way funnyer if there was no tent at all in the picture
Just stay in the city if you are so sensitive.
coming from the guy crying about the color of someones tent
to be fair, its messing up the integrity of the landscape. valid tears.
Its like trash in the landscape. I just want to crumble it up and put it away.
Mine is kind of like a dunce hat.
visibility &amp; rescue. sorry your IG isn't as pure as you desire
just shoop the woop
people pretend not to see me and avoid contact
it must be my clothing
it’s them, not me
Lol
It´s illegal to put up a tent or sleep in the woods where I live.
So I actually have a reason to use camo gear.
Yeah fuck brightly colored anything.
do you live in hell?
So that the workers can locate your corpse when then have to
What workers? These guys? >>2565710
Imagine being bullied by fucking colors.
Wow wilderness is so beautiful, I'm so glad to be here right no-.. wait, is that a fucking neon green tent? What the fucking fuck man? Why would you ever fucking do that to me? My entire day is ruined now because of you and imma bitch on 4chins when I get home because I would get laughed at by anyone else I know in real life for being so autistic... Where are my knives? I need to batonny chop chop before my blood pressure goes through the roof.
I wish I had that meme with the nog in the ball cap asking how internet bullying is even real, just look away from the screen dumbass. Wilderness eye rape... Like you can't look in probably any other direction and be just fine. Fuck off, you guys need to do everyone a favor and commune up so you can get WACO'd already.
Yes. It´s better known as Germany though.
I literally have to evade the police just to sleep in a forest.
sounds kinda fun desu
unless there's some €50,000 fine for getting caught
My biggest problem is there are some really good tents that just don't come in more natural tones. It's not about "wanting to hide" it's that I genuinely think bright neon colors are ugly and yeah, I do wanna larp a bit. It's how I have fun in the woods.
Come to Oregon anon, I’ve got a few acres of forest you can camp in. As long as you’ll help me with practice my German
I'm pretty sure that any agency with any interest in looking for people in tents can do it with thermal imaging.
Also,
expecting privacy in a publicly accessible wilderness area
kek
there are legitimate reasons to not have natural tones on a backcountry hiking tent
It's nice to wake up in a bright pleasant colour compared to some dark coloured tent that just gets hotter in the sun. I prefer just a plain white/light grey though
Earth tones are way more cozy on the inside
complaing about others ruins his photos with thier tent color 
calls others sensitive 
Shiggy diggy
Funny I illegal camped in a bivy in Luxembourg
you rustled the /k/lowns
if you're in a place where you can see other tents you're not far enough /out/
You'd be surprised what cloud cover and foliage can do, anon
not to mention inclement weather
I prefer brightly colored tents so when I go roaming I can actually find my shit again.
I also prefer other people to have brightly colored shit so I can see them and avoid them.

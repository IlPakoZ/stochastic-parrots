Any anons /homeless/ here?
Graduating uni soon and I'm thinking of living out of a 4runner for a little bit to save money while I work a full-time job (Taking as much OT as possible). Rents are just too high and RE is too expensive. Thinking of picking Washington as there is no income tax and COL is high, meaning wages must also be high. I could also kit out a trailer into a nice little office, which I can store in a storage unit during the week. Every weekend, I could take the trailer out and go innawoods.
I plan to get a remote job when I finish my current degree and just live out of a van.
Why not get a pickup truck w/ a camper? Less stealthy, but who cares.
Idk I just like the idea of a van.
Jackson, Wyoming is pretty accepting of this culture. Streets are filled with Van Dwellers and plenty of dispersed camping areas. Pretty easy to make 6 figures working in a restaurant too.
We should only have to live in cars for a little longer. The RE market is about to get hit with a major shake-up, which will hopefully make housing affordable. The trick will be to swoop in and get yourself a home before Blackrock and other speculators snap them all up.
homelessness isn't /out/ related, i hope you drug addicted faggots get stabbed in the street
Thinking of picking Washington
Please don't come here. I hate you mother fuckers, and I say this as an RV dweller who pays lot rent wherever I go. Finding a space to rent with hookups and usually internet can be done in most states for around 450 a month if you're fine living in the sticks.
I'm getting a STEM degree, so I should be able to make $70k+/yr starting.
That's what you think.
The market is saturated.
No, he's right. He will start at $70,000/y. 
His rent will cost him $24,000 per year. 
His car will probably cost him another $6,000 a year between the loan, the maintenance (he won't do it himself) and the insurance. 
He is now down to $40,000 per year, for just his apartment and his car.
Before taxes.
And don't forget that he won't be promoted. He's going to be stuck at that $70,000/y for awhile.
You forgot my taxes, student loans, and onlyfans sub.
If you see a van with out of state plates and someone living inside it, do the world on favor and set them on fire.
Kek someone did this to a homeless guy that was living in his car in a grocery store parking lot near me.
what kind of car?
It was a green imported shitbox. It was completely torched by the time they were done with it. The guy disappeared after that.
I lived out of an rv for a couple years. Its a pain unless it can coexist with your work; and even then its kind of a catch 22 because you have to stay local for work. House is way better.
I encourage other anon’s idea of a truck w/camper shell. Tacoma with a shell can take you anywhere, overlanding even, lasts forever, and you can seperate your driving/sleeping space. More cargo potential when you pull a trailer too.
based, I'm about to have to do it to some homeless faggot that keeps his car at a local park smoking weed and drinking all day. my sister won't let me take my niece and nephew there now because it reeks of weed and booze.
out of state plates 
Why be so picky. Van-homeless are a scourge regardless, shitting up nice rural areas because they can’t function as normal human beings.
make 6 figures working in a restaurant
"Yeah anon it is not hard to make $9,999.00 waiting tables in Wyoming. Easy six figures"
"What do you mean 'cents don't count'?"
Do it, rents a scam. Washington is great for it, tons of national forests &amp; great job opportunities. Bellevue/Seattle is like a hour away from national forests. As a software engineer working remote, I can save 95% of my paychecks while living a great lifestyle.
I ran this set up for a while with a truck canopy w/ camping setup in the back. Worked good until mold. Will rebuild it once the rain stops &amp; I can properly seal everything.
Don't get killed by some random nigger anon that would be a huge disgrace by the way good luck
That 450 probably doesn't include electric. 
Don't try truck/van living unless you're content with having nearly nothing and very little to work with. It's probably only an upgrade to people living on the cold streets.
That 450 probably doesn't include electric. 
You can get water and electric included in a lot places if you're ok with living in the sticks or having a some white trash neighbors. As long as you don't run a space heater you shouldn't spend much in electricity
I'm on the fence between getting truck w/ a camper or any towing-capable vehicle + a trailer that I convert into a living space. I bet I could reach out to locals in the area who would like to earn a little extra money every month to allow me to park my set up on their property, this would eliminate the need for such a compact build and stress of finding a place to sleep.
Suuuup
I have no pity for people who live like this in America. Holy fuck, move someplace you can afford to live. And when you do, adjust your voting habits accordingly.
You mean vote liberal?
vote for the people who fucked up your home state 
I expect nothing less.
I thought California was a paradise tho
Yeah it's a Hellraiser type of paradise
homelessness isn't /out/ related
yes it is lol, go cry somewhere else, or make yet another thread about gay plastic tents or backpacks or whatever shit you goy consoomers are gonna buy next. Fucking cringe.
Imagine being such a loser that even homeless people are cooler than you. Fuck your life nigger lmao
It is paradise, arguably the best state in the nation for all outdoors recreational activities. Unfortunately it has been utterly and completely ruined by the people who live there. Further, now that they have ruined their home state they flee to other states, behave the same way, and ruin them too. 
tfw saw a car with cali plates with a Beto (for Gov) sticker in it
Fuckin go for it.
Been living out of a medium-sized van for about 3 months. I started for the same reason as you; rent too high. 
I have enjoyed it quite a bit, and it has allowed me to travel cheaply. It has some downsides that need to be managed.
The main one is food. Unless you have a freezer in your van, running off you battery, you probably don't have a way to store real food longterm. I won't eat ze bugs nor the hydrogenated seed slop. I got around this by storing a freezer of meat where I work and converting the lion's share of my diet to coffee made with powdered milk, freeze-dried coffee, and sugar. This food has sustained me, and even allowed me to gain lean muscle while I bulk, however, it's not a rich diet. It's critical that you know what vitamins you need and supplement them. For me, some raw liver once a month and a few other niche vitamins covers my basis. 
You've probably already heard it, but get an Anytime Fitness membership. Mine is 40$ a month and I have access to a shower, a toilet, a place to park, and a gym that I use regularly. Every major city has at least one.
Get something that is easy to obscure the insides. You're not always going to have a campsite nearby. Sometimes it's late and you need to park somewhere in the city. If no one can see inside the van, then they will just assume it's parked overnight like all the other cars. I have slept in random parking lots for 3 months and have yet to have anyone give me trouble. All of my windows haver coverings so when you look at it fro the exterior it just looks like there are super dark. 
I can't imagine doing this without a remote job. It's possible, but being anchored to one spot kind of defeats the purpose. That said, you gotta do what you gotta do. 
Good luck anon. Van life is what you make of it. (Ignore the influencers, you can convert a van for cheap if you not a spoiled ass white girl)
there were californians on the phone near me in the parking lot telling their california friends to come here
I say when civil war 2 hits we all go for californians first and then fight it out after
This. Also did this in silicone valley for 2 years before moving to Hawaii. Saved a bunch of money from my 90k tech job and now I'm sitting pretty, working on a catamaran, fucking cute surfer girls. 
Couple rules:
Don't park next to druggy rv's
Don't cook inside the van or hangout outside the van before you sleep. Always arrive, sleep, and leave.
Most tech companies have showers and employee fridges. Eat prepped food until you get a job at a place, then use their shit
Don't get the cooler or fridge. Not worth.
Get rid of cotton socks and underwear. Buy all merino. Doesn't smell and can be washed with just water in a pinch. Smelly stuff ruins the small interior space that is your home. Also another reason not to cook. Cooking grease in your bed room is a bad idea.
When it's hot, find higher altitudes with a breeze. Open the street side window. 
Use Google maps to find 2-4 spots ideally in neighborhoods and save them. Rotate your sleeping there so ppl don't trip about it.
Have fun. I've witnessed the funniest and weirdest shit living in a van. Weirdest thing was some couple fucked up against my van one night. Though they were breaking in. Looked out and just see two ppl making out hardcore. Laughed, went back to sleep and they left, none the wiser.
Get that money.
Pic is my work place now.
I literally cannot comprehend why people put up with this dystopian shit. 
You know there is a whole continent sized country right? And like every major city has jobs for tech? Holy shit, pack your shit and go to Houston or New Orleans and write code for the oil and gas guys. Go to Florida or Georgia and write code for startups. Go to any sunbelt state and write code for Lockheed or Raytheon. 
On second thought. Stay in California.
California has an air force and a navy.
They'll sell them soon to fund reparations
California also controls most of the import export for the United States. Not to mention most of the farming for the entire country. You can larp all you want but let's not forget why the South lost the first time around. Thin supply lines and lack of manufacturing regardless of the amount of guns. This will be the downfall always.
Cope and seethe that he lives a more exciting life than you
What navy? The one that they turned over to Washington because they didn't like the huge naval presence in the Bay?
Yes, the much vaunted and desired life of a homeless person.
I dont think you understand. Per the agreement just formalized with my Yankee friend, we first make California howl, and then we do a re-run of the last war.
Yeah, I think most companies I am applying for have gyms onsite. There is also an expectation of working OT, I'll take as much as I can get just to get ahead/not be in my vehicle. I think working a shit ton of OT will also put me on the fast-track to promotions too. 
I think I'm going to do it, better to struggle for one year than to struggle for 10 years. I'll spend most of my weekday working. Pick up a trailer from storage on weekends, which will have a lot more amenities and a laundry machine. I'll take it out to a campsite over the weekend, play vidya, cook/meal prep, and repeat. Maybe I'll enjoy it so much I just keep doing it.
so mad about being poor your reply to a day old post
lol, lmao even. maybe if you weren't a retarded drug addict you could afford to live hahahaha
working in-person in any sort of population center is tough if you're living out of a 4runner. if you're remote and don't have to do a ton of calls, then you're golden.
ignore this fucking child...why not just get a job and apartment? lol why live in a fucking car.. Rather than nut up and get employed after doing fuck all in undergrad he is now planning to be homeless rather try to apply himself
OK Boomer
Living in a truck is fun &amp; renting is a scam.
explicitly states plan to work full time
Rather than nut up and get employed
this poster is either shitposting or too stupid to read. either way, not worthy of attention
employed and homeless
why choose the worst of both worlds?
Lots of butthurt wages and rentcucks in this thread
if you're remote and don't have to do a ton of calls, then you're golden.
If you're remote, you should move someplace you can at least afford to rent. Holy fuck. The utter degeneracy, the complete lack of self respect.
renting is a viable economic strategy provided its not permanent. When I finished law school, despite an excellent salary, there was a lag time where I simply did not have the means of buying a house. So I rented for 18 months while I built up my finances. 
Alternatively, there is someone in my office who got seconded for a trial. She will be here for like a year or two, no sense in her buying a house. 
peak poverty cope
OK Boomer
I was born in 1993. 
okay boomer
Translation: I am financially illiterate and blame my shortcomings on others 
Show yourself some fucking respect.
Oy vey you're old for 4chan and to be talking about self respect. Keep pushing that rent meme. Maybe if you believe it hard enough it'll make you feel better.
29 
too old for the slowest tamest hobby orientated board on 4chinz
'kay 
rent meme 
Its not a meme if you are financially literate. If you cant afford the basics of a 21'st century human. Either leverage your skills to earn better money, or move someplace you can afford to live. Simple as.
Shit is not sustainable for a majority. It's a flawed system I refused to contribute into. You say "provided its not permanent" which is true, but there is a growing number of people where it is permanent since it's increasingly hard to escape out of. 
I'm assuming you live in a place that makes it reasonable to purchase a home under 200k. OP posted about Washington, which at the bare minimum is 500k for anything worth actually buying. Living in a cozy truck is better than forfeiting 1.5k a month for rent as I posted in >>2548552 . If you have no means of getting a decent job/salary/education or just wanna save money faster, alternative living is great.
nobody is going to pay your mortgage anymore shlomo. the goyim know.
mfw 2 bedroom house on half-acre surrounded by trees and only a 10 minute ride to work
$600/month
Just make more money. 
It's that easy.
No, unless he is mechanical engineering or computer science he most definitely will not make that kind of money starting. With a 4 year degree in literally anything else in stem except maybe EE he'll make $45 - $50k starting. If you make the mistake of BioE like I did you can expect to be homeless anyway. What are you a fuckin college recruiter?
you just did the same thing nigger stay mad lmao, also your projection is visible from space, or are you just a dumb redneck?
hurr durr he must be homeless himself
ok retard
I feel like all the people in this thread bitching about living in a van/truck/etc. don't spend much time /out/.
I am already spending every weekend sleeping at trailheads in and/or sleeping in my tent while on trails. I hate going back to my apartment (which isn't a bad apartment) and having to go into work during the week. I would love to work remotely and just be able to spend all my time driving around the country to different trails.

Move. 
le based trad conservative living as a vagrant
fuck off we're full
kill yourself tourist
the other homeless here will eat you alive
Move
This is /out/ and you are telling someone to leave the best /out/ state in the lower 48.
Yes. I am telling you that your financial future is more important than the ability to hike a nice trail on the w/end. 
You dont even have to leave the state. Anon, claims to be able to work remote. Nothing stopping him going to a small town and working from there. Hell, a rural local would surely provide more /out/ opportunities than an urban one?
apply yourself to being a wagie
have fun, retard.
Anon, claims to be able to work remote. Nothing stopping him going to a small town and working from there.
Internet access might. Plenty of small towns out there have shit internet. I'm not reading 66 replies to see if he needs high up/down speeds, but if he's video conferencing or uploading large files then he'll want decent speeds.
Get a chinese diesel heater bro. Mold because propane creates moisture. Get a vent fan too
Yes. I am telling you that your financial future is more important than the ability to hike a nice trail on the w/end.
Financial future is irrelevant. If I made 100k/yr in a remote job, I would still live in a van.
Starlink exists for this reason alone. It’s a godsend for us rural chads.
Yea, that's the plan. I'm not entirely concerned about the moisture from propane, since I run it with the back open. But I never knew it created moisture, so thanks for letting me know!
The mold problem was mostly from me being a dumbass in a few ways... Parked on a hill for a few weeks... Left curtains down... A few new leaks from the rare PNW snow....... 
But live and learn I suppose. It's only like 30$ worth of wood and I dissembled everything to save all the hardware. So over-all not a big loss. Great opportunity to build it better :D!
Haha for-real, last year I netted ~170k while still living in my truck over the summer. Can't wait to rebuild and get back to it.
Those were some of the happiest days I've experienced.
No. Starlink is extremely variable w/ speeds. At my cabin it's not good enough to support zoom calls. At best I can watch 240p Youtube, at worst I cant load pages.
I have no idea how that’s happening for you, but I’d wager you have some obstructions… or massive congestion?
Here (lane county OR) it’s been virtually flawless. 4K streaming works perfectly, typical throughput is ~170MB/s down 15MB/s up, with roughly 25ms latency.
Coming from viasat as well as cellular, there is no comparison.
I dont dispute that you're an idiot.
Unless you are raising a family, I see absolutely no reason to lock yourself to one place when you could live in a nice van and be anywhere you feel like at any time.
Its an asset that insulates your wealth against inflation and taxation. If you dont want to live in it, rent it out.
Not sure if you guys are trolling or what but starlink isn't released to the public yet.
holy shit this dumbass missed the entire point of the thread omegalul

nta but i studied forestry in school, and currently get paid $50/hr
Kek nobody with a forestry degree makes $50/h. If you would've said a meme degree like marketing I would've believed you.
graduated with honours from a CalPoly, got a B.Sc. in forestry w/ a minor in GIS
pay is $36.5/hr + 25% bonus for health and wellness + $50 per diem.
i make just under $2100/week pre tax, takehome is just over $1500/week after everything is taken out
i'm sorry you got a degree in something and didnt pivot to something profitable in your industry, but forestry pays dumbfuck money if you are competent
pay is $36.5/hr
$50/hr 
Which is it?
Cope and seeth. 250k is the new 100k. You can piss and moan about society while still taking part in it.
$36.5/hr * 1.25 = $46/hr
$50 per diem / 8 hours = $6.25/hr
$46 + $6.25 = $52.25/hr
so i guess i was wrong, i make more than $50/hr
easy to spend money quickly when you always get more; many people who come into money end up penniless soon afterwards due to poor financial planning
do u work for esri
Uh huh, just know that most people with decent grades in soft STEM degrees don't get government jobs thrown at their holes as soon as they graduate, appreciate that you experiencing the STEM field on easy mode. No go forth, and cry about the gender wage gap no further.
literally just joined the local union to look at plants growing near powerlines lmao, there are like 50 other dumbfucks doing the exact same thing in this city alone
apply for job
next day HR calls and says they will forward my app
day after manager calls and offers me a job
it’s really just that easy
Very cringe. 
The thread derailed because right at the start the only valid answer was given
fucking move to someplace you can afford to live 
And that resulted in the ocean of cope 
no no no I am actually well to do I merely choose to live like a vagrant 
This, in a big way.
imitate only the best op
Larp, as always.
Any Europeans doing this? I want to buy a van and build into temporary residence to climb and travel for maybe one or two months max at a time.
This guy's face is the stereotypical bum alcoholic face. If you'd see him in the street, even well dressed, you'd wonder if he's an alcoholic bum.
no, though i use the ESRI suite of GIS products
i work for the powerline union
fucking move to someplace you can afford to live
Not whoever you're arguing with, but the answer to that is always
No, I like it here
Van life is not all that bad when you're still young and make decent salary. I never really understand why do these threads always get desperate losers saying what can be basically surmised as 'Stop enjoying things I don't like'.
Same reason why some choose to live in countries with lower cost of living but first world salaries w/ remote work or businesses.
i own a camper van, not some ghetto converted panel van and ive tried to vanlife it in BC. 
vanlife is really annoying now due to A) gas prices B) cities cracking down hardcore on people living in vehicles. its not really a viable strategy to avoid paying the rental jew since youll be burning a similar amount every month on car repairs,cost to move around, getting decent data plans to actually exist in modern society, gym membership, increased spending on food due to limitations in cooking/refrigeration. also crackheads are relentless now. 
its really fucking gay trying to live in a major population center in a van and trying to hold down a real job(i.e. a job that makes you be presentable irl). Its just too difficult to spin the plates of modern wagey life while you dont have a toilet and a shower. it can work if you live somewhere that has zero accommodations but a strong demand for jobs(aka vacation towns) but still allows people to live in town in a van, these are rare now though.
Its only really viable as a way to see large swathes of your countries outdoors for cheap and take long vacation that you can skirt the parts of america that arent an apocalyptic wasteland. its not a viable way out of the wage cage unless can seriously get creative with a remote job
Actually we’re getting pretty tired of these hobos in Wyoming. Fuck off.
are you a teenage girl or something?
muh alcoholic bums
you sound like you just have to ask your parents to buy you a van lol
Why are you upset, do you look like him? Most homeless have specific faces. You can tell a lot by a man by his face.
Emphasis on the crackhead part. You're going to get shit from normies but you're also easy prey for drug addicts and other scumbags. It sucks because the few places that'd be perfect for van/camper life is riddled with them.
Just move somewhere affordable 
It's not hard.
Somewhere affordable doesn't give the same employment possibilities. Some professionals can't just move to a random medium sized town and expected a career out there. Especially when starting off. Most careers that require living in expensive places start out hard due to several barriers of entry and not making that much for the area initially, but it pays off even three years later when you can leverage a better salary. It's insanity telling people to forget their careers and not to look for alternative ways to live. Obviously you can't live in a van forever and I don't think anyone is recommending this in a serious capacity. The economic reality is that to be competitive and to have a real career you MUST live in places you can't ordinarily afford or will struggle to make meets end. You will STRUGGLE because there is competition. It's idiotic to suggest leaving that behind and fucking off into some irrelevant backwater when that doesn't work for almost all career paths. Maybe if you want to work in a very niche outdoors job that lets you live in some rural location with good salary this is good advice, but in most cases it is like a kid trying to advise grown up men.
Living in a camper van makes it very obvious you're there to sleep in that camper. Regular vans and cars will attract suspicion, but there's some benefit of doubt that a camper van will simply not have. If you're in one there's no doubt why you're camping out in random places. If it is just a van, you can get away with a lot more.
I live in small town louisiana making 45k/year in a house that costs $600/m in rent
If you can't find happiness with $1000-1300 disposable income, joining the rat race in an overpopulated city isn't going to help.
Unironically: Let me guess, you "need" more?
It's not purely about income, like I said most fields of work simply require you to exist in a very expensive area.
Very few, if any anon. 
There's good work everywhere.
There might be, but someone who studied, invested time and money into a specific field to study something is just not going to randomly get a job being a roofer in some small Louisiana town, even if it the income and what they can put aside is not all that bad.
invest time
invest money
You barely studied in college and you paid for it with other people's money.
C'mon anon, do you have some sort of identify you're trying to form?
Be happy anon. That's all there is to it. 
It sounds from the get-go you've chained and shackled yourself to a specific field.
You don't seem to comprehend that some people want to be in a specific career.
I do
And I'm here to tell them they're going to be wrong and if they get stuck on it, they'll be miserable for the rest of their lives.
Easy come, easy go anon. 
Don't get too hung up on stuff.
retard advice
don't become a doctor bro because it will be hard for a few years
not trolling, but are you a diversity hire or what?
This is wrong
Your experience != universal truth
Assuming he's telling the truth he's probably more like a strategic waste of state funding. They're either
A) diverting funds to this to divert attention away from something else, or to draw attention to this specifically for future reasons (campaigns)
B) doing this to avoid funding something else
C) all of the above
small booty white girls 
That's a no-go chief.
I spent the last two years on my sailboat. Back on land now. Sold my boat and upgrading to a 41' so I can do transatlantic trips. I hate being tied down to an apartment, but this job pays well, and will fund my wind hippie dreams.
Most of them are programmers and yes 100k is the good life.
100k is the good life.
If you live in the rural south, maybe. Anywhere near a major city, no. Better up that figure by several thousand if you want to live the good life.
near a major city
the good life
kill yourself
Just graduated with an EE degree. First offer I got was $66k/yr and guaranteed raises every year. Within 5 years, I'll be over $100k.
Where do you think programmer jobs are, genius? Hint: they aren't remote.
Streets are filled with Van Dwellers
That just makes me think that Jackson WY is a trashy shithole with a homeless problem.
They are remote though.
These "homelesss" people are climbers and skiers living in expensive ass vans filled with expensive ass gear.
Oh we're bringing back that meme again?
Bro it's Jackson. They are obviously all climbers and skiers. There is no other reason homeless people would try to live there.
I did this back in 2019 because rent in colorado is fucking dumb and I had a big enough bed on my truck to put a camper shell on it and a cot. I saved a shitload of money, you just have to swap camping spots every two weeks and don't fall trap to buying shit at a gas station every time you go to one. The town I lived near(salida-leadville) had bath houses I bought a membership at, and I was religious about laundry.
$75k salary not bad but still, then you have to live in cali dude
I'm about to start a 14/7 camp job and also thinking about taking the homeless pill. Tacoma + cap/shell and stay in campgrounds/crown land on my days off.
Did the mounties finally catch him sleeping in the woods?
$75k
it's around that after taxes, yes
I also pay $400/mo in rent for a studio and live in a beautiful coastal city while living on a horse ranch, so i dont really care what your retarded opinion about california or my wages are lol
do horses care that they walk around all day naked?
Rootless parasites such as these should be killed. Literally as if a gypsy born in another life
t. loser with no sense of adventure
4runner
solar water heater for hot water
larger one with tray for cooking food, both will double as thermoses for keeping shit hot for a couple hours(also sealed to reduced food smell)
collapsible bucket with wood step you can put in it, some rapid dry antimicrobial shower curtains with magnets to attach to ceiling, sand filter to catch all your soap and a small shower hook via magnet, now you too can be clean, showered and not use gallons of water keeping fresh
12/24volt fridge/freezer, lots of good ones and crap ones, always run it off a separate battery bank, with a panel on top, free fridgeration everywhere
also any number of lights(solar recharge ones that don't breakdown, $5 buck minimum)
vent a MUST(leaving windows open just invites poor kids and deadbeats to break in looking for change/money/phones and stereo's to sell after a couple weeks(when pawn shops don't have to report it no more)
get a scrubber bag dry bag to self clean small numbers of your clothes for places without laundromats/retracting clothes line
forget all those other toilets, just use a WELL SEALED CASET TOILET, legal to dump the shit/piss in all states(with each ones differing laws), sealed so no smell unless you leave it full for days/weeks. Try to shit elsewhere on principle. Not on street, sidewalk, along the road. Use a cot to stay cooler during the summer, add blankets below it to stay warmer, get a diesel heater with a gas can attachment to double as a gas can for really cold locations.
people no longer believe in their 401k's, KNOW that they need to grab their pensions as soon as possible because they get robbed/defunded at a drop of a hat, people currently believe in their homes as their only REAL investments, thus all those laws and shit, crappy rent costs, and all those investment firms buying up property everywhere, vehicles are now considered short term investments by some people
You do realize you are on /out/ right? Why would someone leave one of the top /out/ states in the country for some boring shit state like florida?
yes, they also prefer to be warm like us and often do well if you drape blankets over them
being homeless and being a van hipster are two VERY different things, and if I think about it both groups deserve the lifestyle of the other. Give the hobos some decent equipment, and let the hipsters be destitute and eat out of dumpsters. They might learn something. OP is a massive faggot.
Not really. They're the same thing.
if you live in a shithole maybe
Only white women think vanlife is some kind of adventure
money and access to money are the only real difference between the two
most Hipsters and shit have access to drugs, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS and use them with some doctors prescribing them just to use recreationally
Poor guys/bums do crimes/steal/trade copper and parts for their drugs instead.
Most law enforcement gets all their pay and money via drug wars laws. THEY LOVE catching pounds of weed/dope/meth/etc because it nets them large amounts of federal money that their small towns and cities couldn't afford to pay them with. Thus hounding the homeless and hoping to score free vehicles, drug busts, and more. All the land is officially owned now, so no one can go and be a forest monk no more. No States support bottle/bag/can rebates because they want their homeless to generate money for their police departments, make them feel good about locking them up, and getting more federal money, free forced labor, and supporting their housing markets valuations.
You have no imagination.
Well obviously you couldn't afford rent, can't be utopia.
Fuck off, and stay out.
just be a part of my jewish society why do you faggots have to live without supporting banks and globohomo businesses!
I'll continue getting everything free while you wageslave. Thanks for the tax money!
100k is basically minimum wage in this economy. im married and our hose hold income is a bit over 200k total. we live in a 3 bed 2 bath, thankfully we bought it pre pandemic for 400k, today it's worth more like 800. 2 6 figure earners together couldn't buy a 3 bed 2 bath in a decent part of town today. sUsTaInAbL3.
i honestly don't know how a family of 4 making 100k is even surviving these days. been grocery shopping lately? 250 a week is normal if you're planning meals and eating cheap. add steaks once a week and that's another 60 bucks easily.
Where do you live that makes 100,000k not upper middle class?
lmao there's really still people in the world who think that being a wage slave cuck living in a concrete box being poisoned by smog and plastic in your blood sent off to work having your time and labor stolen by greedy corporations is 'functioning as a normal human being' and on top of that they gaslight and pressure people into thinking this servitude is a real and sustainable way to live hahahaha you people (mostly boomers) are so fucked in the head, beyond repair, have fun slaving away to pay off your concrete box.
Have you seen those little cages they put hens into in these dystopian factory farms? Now imagine they would make the hen pay for the privilege to be imprisoned there being forced to work. That's you in your house in the suburbs, boomer.

The entire world is his home. Close-minded aren't you?
Landlord hands typed this post
I have a 4runner that I converted. Can you live out it full time? Sure. But you won’t enjoy it. I tried it for a week and it’s far from ideal. It’s a great weekender build though and comfy when you want to go camp.
I did this during the start of Covid. My job went fully remote so I sold my house and a lot of my garbage possessions, loaded what I needed (including wife and two dogs) and drove halfway across the country to basically car camp for 6 months while we looked for property to buy. Worked off cell phone service the whole time, now you can get Starlink RV which is great (currently living in an RV on aforementioned property and using Starlink for internet).
We had a lot of success using this as a transitional step from one lifestyle to the next, but be warned - a lot of people end up just pissing away their time and money because the realities of being homeless by choice/vanlife/whatever you want to call it is that a lot of things you used to take for granted are now pains in the ass and cost you money and there is likely a lot of gear you will need to get if you want to be able to do things like have power or be able to take showers.
There is a lot of boredom, there is a good bit of being miserable (like backpacking with no upside), you will spend obscene amounts of time just maintaining a consistent lifestyle and doing it alone is not going to be any less of a total pain in the ass.
We took it as a massive risk and it worked out for us, but it frequently felt not worth it at the time and I don't really know how doable it would have been for me to do in my 20s straight out of college.
Bros, not sure if related, but didn't want to make a new thread.
Basically im tired of this shit, and i just want to go live in the wild. Not really a homestead, but as close as hunter-gathers used to, do you have any resources where i can learn the skills needed to survive? Preferably books.
I know you may think im a larper but is either go to the wild or kms in the city.
Unironically? Spend time with these guys, because the next best thing would probably just be those communities in remote parts of Siberia that still partially live off the land.

Get a slingshot and use little rocks the size of grapes.
Find a nice hidden position and hit the vehicle. Find different positions to practice from. 
He won't be able to figure out from which direction it comes from if you change places often. 
He probably won't chance going to the police as he probably already has complaints about his loitering there.
He'll get the message and move on somewhere else. Try this before using torch method. 
Druggies have no self-awareness, pretty soon he'll be shitting on the sidewalk and jerking off in front of kids. Do it anon.
the money you schmuck
Welcome to life in Clapistan
Then you should contact star link. That’s fucked
Starlink deep in the Adirondacks here and able to video conference with ease, stream anything we need to
most of the farming for the entire country
Lmao you mean almonds and avocados? Cash crops are in California, the actual breadbasket is the middle of the country
literally anywhere within 30 miles of a top 100 population center in the CONUS or Europe?
In the last 3 years I've lived in Boston, Salt Lake, Vegas, Reno, and Phoenix and Phoenix was really the only one I'd say 100k is even livable as lower middle class. No way it's upper middle class. That was at the start of the pandemic so it's unlikely that's even true anymore with property increases.
Define upper middle class. I'd say its a family of 4 as being able to afford owning a 3 bed 2 in an ok neighborhood, 2 ok cars, a family vacation every year and 2 kids. That's a minimum of 150k a year in little towns, more like 250k a year in civilization and something like 400k a year in large metros today.
Any thoughts on doing this in the UK? Like the sound of it for a bit to save.
It’s kinda fucked how much property values have gone up.
Last apartment I rented was 1175 (2bd 1bth, nice neighborhood)
7 years later it’s now 1800 a month.
If you didn’t buy a house pre money-printing-orgy; your prospects are dim at best.
A family of 4 could be very comfortable on 100k provided they aren’t having to pay north of 2.5k a month for a mortgage (god forbid they’re having to rent a house). The situation is completely untenable.
I dunno cars aren't that big, rooftop tents are kind of cool to hang out in if your homeless but most of it being able to stand up and walk around..summers you need a shower in the morning and maybe a shower after work and another one after working out..so that would be 3 showers..alot of water issues with van dwelling so always need access to facilities. As far as work is concerned you need to shower before work usually so if work really early in the morning it isn't an option..thats where people rather live in homes or use showerbags with heated water..not smelling is always the issue..if near a mall you could shit mall restrooms during the day but if you need shit late at night like alot of people do that isn't an option so you need to shit..thats the meme..alot of drug related crimes because of that. No engineer degrees thats 126 IQ business..thats a no.
That shit sucks ass when you spend any real amount of time in it because how confined it is.
Very VERY illegal in the UK. Not worth all the legal troubles that this would cause desu.
it's illegal in the UK to cope with homelessness by using your vehicle as a place to shelter you from the elements
is the UK even real?
It was, once. These days I think it's just being allowed to exist as a warning to the others.
Kill van dwellers. Behead van dwellers. Roundhouse kick a van dweller into the concrete. Slam dunk a van dweller's baby into the trashcan. Crucify filthy van dwellers. Defecate in a van dweller's food. Launch van dwellers into the sun. Stir fry van dwellers in a wok. Toss van dwellers into active volcanoes. Urinate into a van dweller's gas tank. Judo throw van dwellers into a wood chipper. Twist van dwellers heads off. Report van dwellers to the IRS. Karate chop van dwellers in half. Curb stomp pregnant van dwellers. Trap van dwellers in quicksand. Crush van dwellers in the trash compactor. Liquefy van dwellers in a vat of acid. Eat van dwellers. Dissect van dwellers. Exterminate van dwellers in the gas chamber. Stomp van dwellers skulls with steel toed boots. Cremate van dwellers in the oven. Lobotomize van dwellers. Mandatory abortions for van dwellers. Grind van dwellers fetuses in the garbage disposal. Drown van dwellers in fried chicken grease. Vaporize van dwellers with a ray gun. Kick old van dwellers down the stairs. Feed van dwellers to alligators. Slice van dwellers with a katana.
Absolutely the most succinct and profound comment on the UK.
i'm not saying i would murder a van dweller but they are up there with prostitutes, transients, and hitchhikers in convenience &amp; you know nobody cares about them enough to look for them or knows enough about their whereabouts to find you.
Fuck every 40s or something bum going around asking for cigs
Fuck public bathrooms
Fuck Gypsies
Total Crackhead death
being a vancuck
being homeless
not looking for a cave and turning it into your hideout where you can fill it with booby-traps to catch feds trying to make you pay rent
Ngmi
Total Vanigger Death
so you're telling me the crackhead problem is all the pigger's fault?
Saved a bunch of money from my 90k tech job
fucking cute surfer girls.
and then everyone clapped
imagine this guys teeth
/out/ once again completely misses the point of living in a van
Yes washington is great. And as you said CoL is high so wages are relatively high even for shit like retail.
Shittiest part about it is Seattle and very lax EBT requirements and thieving/drug use laws pulled a shit load of homeless from the nation to washington. But the farther you get from cityfag area the less likely you'll run into crack heads. You'll still see them if you work in the suburbs but they generally fuck off
Another note is any forest/park within a mile of a major chain store or bus line will have homeless, so if you find a spot and think "this will be easy" you probably goofed
bro just find a cave
Caves are unironically boomer tourist attractions now a days. Do you even uncle ted?
Also buy a recording device set to email video every x days unless you enter a pause phrase for faggots like this
This is the dream but I want to caution anyone anti social enough to do this that its not that simple. dont go anywhere until you have the job locked down.
its obviously just an early warning layer to keep primitive anarchos from setting fire to relays. easily worth the money paid out. Like amazon pays me rediculous money for the work required for the same reason. it's not because it's work. I do the same ammount of work as a cash register, maybe less. theres no counting or people. I typically make 30% or more than any of them though. Why? loyalty. They don't want their workers to walk. simple as.
One thing living in wilderness and another is living very close to people and being exposed to worst human scum possible.
Alright, but where do you live?
campgrounds
tacoma
Fucking what? Lmao
thinking about picking Washington
Fuck off, we're full.
COL is high, meaning wages must also be high
HAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAA
holy shit do you actually believe that??
What part of this doesn't make sense?
What are tips, you fucking morons.
great and inspiring attitude bro
I misread. I thought you were implying tacoma city, not tacoma truck
It's time to start exterminating these genetic misfires.

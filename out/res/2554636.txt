Are gravity filters a meme? Are UV-C purifiers enough? What do you use for big groups?
Violently and with passion
hahaha
mostly use aqua tabs, but will use something like a sawyer or quickdraw if I want a mechanical compenent.
CNOC bladder connected to a sawyer squeeze and hung out of a tree with paracord to produce a gravity feed.
I think chems are the best way of treating large amounts of water. Just up the dose for the volume.
I have a mini so I use that because it works. Cheaper, lighter, and smaller.
Yeah. Best protection against the majority of pathogens, fastest to use and now chemical taste.
Aquamira for the convenience. The threat of infection is mostly hype.
First Need filter system, WP tablets, Aquamira drops. Depends on the circumstances.
In 15 years of outings I have never filtered my water. Where the fuck are people going where the water isn't going to literally be cleaner than tap water in most places.
In my first year of really going /out/ I became so sick from drinking unfiltered water that I thought I was going to die while liquid shit blew out my ass and vomit out my mouth at the same fucking time. Ignorant moron.
What did the doctor say?
I didn't go to the doctor I was /out/ and it flushed from my sister after 8-12 hours. Rapid onset and recovery.
From my system*
That was the detox from the tap water, not the /out/ water making you sick.
Nonsense I'm a anti fluoride tin foil bro I don't drink the tap water lmao.
In my country all /out/ sites are in the mountains so there's plenty of clean springs and snow melt to drink from. But in other places it might not be the case.
Definitely not a meme. Me and the boys all have one we take when we do multi day float trips. I have a katydan, one has a platypus, another uses a sawyer. Convenient as fuck you just fill them up and hang them on a tree. Packs down fairly small. They all work about the same. If you're using just one for a big group you'll want something bigger like a 10L. Ours are all 3-4L and typically get filled twice a dayish. Can't speak to the uv ones, I've always been leary of them and haven't tried it.
I can only afford a DeathStraw™...
Dude don't feel bad you can't afford all this shit people say you need. I never spend a fuck ton of money on gear. Most of my hiking bags are used army bags from army/navy stores or something I've found at goodwill. I don't spend long 7 nights camping in but i frequent isolated places. You can find good shit that's cheap if you look hard enough. Also, get in google maps and find places no one goes close to your home. You will be amazed at what you find. I dunno just my thoughts.
What's wrong with life straws? Do they not properly filter water?
They won't filter viruses (but that's only a concern in developing countries, especially crowded campsites and potential shtf/natural disaster scenarios). I've always just thought they looked awkward though, either you're filling your water bottle with dirty water or, what, sticking your head down to the puddle to suck away?
Nothing can filter viruses. Come on I've looked into enough of then to work this out. Unless you're going for that sawyer bottle squeeze thing which is a filter mixed with an iodine tablet in the form of foam then you're bullshitting. That sawyer thing with foam is the only thing on the market that can remove viruses.
Do viruses survive in bodies of water in a concentration high enough to reasonably contract? Most of the waterborne diseases I can think of such as Cholera and Giardia are bacteria instead of viruses. Also, do viruses not die after a relatively short period of being outside the body?
Do viruses survive in bodies of water in a concentration high enough to reasonably contract? 
Some do. Some don't.
Some do. Some don't.
What type of water purification tablets do I need btw? I need those that basically act as a LifeStraw.
There´s those that only keep already clean water fresh for a longer time, by stopping bacterial growth inside an RV water tank for example, but I need those that you put in dirty, shady water, you can´t trust to begin with?
All I can find are those that advertise as keeping already clear water clean for a longer duration.
Giardia isn't even a bacteria, it's more closely related to humans
I use the MSR guardian and fill a bag. Most of the water around here is pretty clean, so you can just drink out of the source.
Do viruses survive in bodies of water in a concentration high enough to reasonably contract?
Yes. It's a major problem around the world, not so much in the West but on a global scale the death toll from waterborne viral infections is well into the millions. 
Not necessarily. Like the other anon said, it depends on the virus but rotavirus for example (one of the leading causes of diarrhoeal illnesses worldwide and responsible for half a million deaths/year) can survive in cold water or on dry, smooth surfaces for months (although closer to days in warm water or surfaces exposed to good sun). The same goes for a range of other viruses.
Aren’t those diseases spread via fecal matter in places with high population densities and substandard municipal water infrastructure?
Aren’t those diseases spread via fecal matter
They enter the water system via faecal matter but that doesn't mean you're safe so long as you don't start chowing down on floating turds, turbulence will spread them throughout the area and theyre perfectly capable of surviving as free-floating virions. A water filter won't protect you from viral illness just because it filters out faecal material.
Oh and theoretically urine, respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids could contaminate the water supply but in practice they tend to be fairly insignificant. 
Yes, like I said "only a concern in developing countries, especially crowded campsites and potential shtf/natural disaster scenarios"
Viral contamination of water sources became a serious problem with all the idiots flocking to national parks during the pandemic. Literally shitting the place up.
dangit. Guys I want to keep it simple. Is filtering water trough pebbles and sand, then boiling it good enough 99% of times?
Can you boil water after treating it with Katadyne tablets that have chlorine in them?
Wouldn´t it set free toxic gasses?
Your description fits fungi spores really well.
If there's such beings in the water it might be a good idea to filter + UV pen it.
You’ll have sand in your water and will have to wait for it to cool because you chose to build a survivalist LARP water filter instead of buying one for $25 at Walmart but yeah, it will most likely be safe to drink after boiling. Boiling is probably the safest option.
If you're going to boil your water then you can skip filtering it completely and still be fine >99% of the time. Maybe filter it through sand or even just a bandanna if it's murky but don't worry about viruses, bacteria or protozoa - boiling will kill all of them just fine. Make sure you boil it for long enough though. 
Still, I wouldn't call boiling the simplest solution. It takes time and effort to build a fire. Sounds like a real hassle if you're going to be on the move all day and want to take advantage of water sources as you pass by. 
Perfectly safe bro. Maybe if you were grinding the tablets up into a crack pipe and smoking them you'd have something to worry about (but the melting point of sodium dichloroisocyanurate is 225C so probably not even then.
i usually just use filters, waters pretty good here
i have a gravity filter and a 5gal pail for when my car camping trip goes long
boiling water is safer, but it always tastes flat and smokey. mint hepls
Lightweight anon here. Stiĺl own and use General Ecology's First Need at 1lb weight. 7 continents, all 50 states and 70+ countries. Heavy yet works, rapidly pulling delicious pure water, no viruses, chems etc., from rice paddies, water near mine tailings, S. American polluted rivers, zebu urine holes, and rabies infested beaver ponds. Delicious and here in this life, trust with my life. Boil order here or there, no problem. My luxury item even in the states.
I was a bit surprised when I got my Aquamira and it talked about RV water supplies on the label. It’s Chlorine Dioxide so it’ll kill everything in the water. You just have to wait a bit. It’s not too expensive. Like $15 for enough to treat 30 gallons. You’ll want to pre filter the water first. It’ll purify the sediment but you don’t want to be drinking gritty water. Alternatively you could get disinfecting bleach and add it to suspect water. Although I doubt it would taste as good.
tbqh I have never filtered water in my life and I grew up doing a lot of mountaineering. Don't drink water downstream of swamps lakes or people and you'll be fine. Why do people make such a big deal of this?
I don't filter my water, and I've never gotten sick from it either.
Not like I'm drinking from the yang-zhe river or some shit.
Just avoid still water, and you'll be fine, assuming you're somewhere remote.
It’s typical marketing, Anon. We were told by the people selling water filters that we would get sick and possibly die without it. That sentiment was echoed in every publication, all of which received advertising revenue from the companies selling filters. I’m not saying it was a conspiracy by Big Filter, just basic Bernays propaganda.
Isn't it like 4 hours for giardia and crypto?
Just a bandana. I'm usually able to find springs or mountainous streams.
Yes, it’s 4 hours for parasites that occur around high population centers in third world countries.
Sounds like a skill issue
It’s something like that. It’s like 30 minutes for stuff like bacteria. Filters are really the best bet for stuff like Giarda and crypto. If you filter and chemically treat you’ll be extra good. Filters aren’t that expensive. It’s like $30 for a sawyer or Katydyn. I think they fit on smart water bottles. Many soft water bladders fit them. Katydyn sells a kit with filter and bladder for various prices. As does Sawyer. 
If you don’t treat your water and get sick you’ll wish you spent the money when you’re shitting yourself inside out.
Honestly though, just because you drink a cyst doesn't mean you're guaranteed to develop an infection. And if you do develop symptoms it's usually just diarrhoea and abdo pain.
If you're willing to roll the dice then so be it. Unless you have kids, there's a small chance of developing chronic giardia infection which, if not recognised, cab cause growth restriction and shit.
I feel like it's way more likely that you're an underaged poster trying to sound tough with this lie on a basket weaving forum
no
boiling it
you don't need to filter it.
if it looks clear and you don't see any nculear power plants anywhere just drink it(after boiling it)
you didn't boil it. that's why
it will have bacteria in it
I have used my platypus 4L filter to much success and I really like it. A great way to easily filter a lot f water once you set up camp
this guys series on water filtration is excellent. Good science based approach and backed up with studies and info.

Guardian purifiers will filter viruses, but they cost like 400 bucks.
never filtered my water but during army i tried few of those cleaning tablets and it tasted like pool water if that counts
i check my map if the stream has any farmsteads upstream and then drink away, lakewater is always good to go as it swamp water
honestly since i heard about it i have always though whole filtering thing is just a moneygrab but then again there are 3rd world countries where it is a real daily survival thing
A grayl bottle will
$400 saved
I haven't gone out (still looking for a sturdy ruck) but my system is as follows...
-Lifestraw Mission 5L Gravity Filter
-Aquatabs
-Kovea Spider stove with LPG adapter
-1qt steel cup
-64oz steel bottle
Thinking of getting a hydrapak or other collapsible bottle. A small one to use as a bidet, and a larger one to place in my fanny pack with spare tablets.
We're all about redundancy here. I'm planning a thru-hike and I don't like shopping in strange areas.
You use purifiers to save fuel and make room for more snacks.
katadyn befree + purinize
pretty much all water around here is pretty fucked
That's nonsense. People don't shit themselves after drinking well water. Well water has zero fluorine and zero chlorine.
Yes, buy things and take as much extraneous crap as possible. Weight isn’t a factor and it’s important to buy products that make you look cool.
Hahaha that was my first backpacking overnight. Then i realized there is no way to store the water or cook with it. Thank God I had worthwhile friends
okay lads, did i get memed on
I bought the Swayer squeeze because all the UL fags rave about it
but i just dont understand what advantage this gives me over just having a bladder and some purification tabs. it seems like a far more complicated AND heavier system
Squeeze
carry all this shit, and some extra bottles
vs Bladder + purification tabs/drops
to get water, fill, then filter to another bottle or bladder, or drink through this awkward attachment thing
vs Bladder + purification tabs/drops
literally just fill bladder and add purifier
gravity filter kit things are a meme
What do you use for big groups?
everyone should have their own way to purify water.
one extra communal gravity setup going to make life easy at base camp.
the idea of being the "water boy" for a group is fucking dumb. what if someone gets lost or separated? what if you fall off a cliff with the only water filtration gear? common sense = why nobody does this stupid shit. 
what are you a fag?
just run it through a sawyer, if its really nasty put a tab in it or boil it for a while.
make your own diy. less coonsumer, cheaper, better because its tailored to your bladder/bottle, lighter weight. lots of guides on youtube to show you how to make one a variety of ways.
has some1 told you that you can leave all the cleaning kit stuff at home and bring a smartwater sports cap instead? its the perfect size to use to clean out a sawyer.
main reason people use it is because the sawyer has no aquamira tablet water taste.
and because chemical/mechanical filtration isn't the same. one might be better or worse for the water in your area. sometimes you want to do both. depends what's in it.
Wtf just put the Sawyer on the smartwater and drink it
Really getting back to nature friend
Tell us about Antarctica. If I wanted to go what is the simplest route?
North
me too
Through my teeth. I had my gaps adjusted to one micron so I just spit out the giardia.
or just... you know... squeeze the water through the filter as intended. This is retarded
Iodine.
If water is clear and I only need to get rid of parasites from cows grasing and shitting higher up in the mountain, I just use Micropur. 
If water is not clear (this is rare in the Alps but happens every now and then) I first run it through a coffee filter to get it in my bottle. Then Micropur. 
Never had any issue.
Bro lol.. 
Also way too much crap
Pretty much, when your getting into multi week camping with this much gear your more getting into the campervan lifestyle.
https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-FWC-WSH-15.02
rolling boil, three minutes
Wow this is beautiful, where is this?
Legal told them to add the asterisk because the claim is probably bull shit
/out/ either drinks straight from the source or uses the most trendy consoomer product on the market. No in between.
I assume you are Finnish. Are you in north, east, west or south Finland? I am in southwest and around here I wouldn't dare to drink out of lakes without at least boiling the water first. Afaik even evira has also tested the water in those lakes and deemed it dirty.
LOATHE filtering water with every cell in my body.
I have a Sawyer squeeze, it doesn't filter viruses like others have said, but I camp in the Rockies where I get clean water from waterfalls and fast flowing streams. I don't think viruses are a concern in this scenario unless you are pulling from a lake or something
all filters are a fucking meme for retards
bring your own water, retard.
half of you malicious psychopaths that never leave your house and the other half are just retarded
I want to reach through my computer screen and smack you. retard.
1lb of this purifies 10,000 gallons of water. Why aren't you running this in your kit, anon? It is much more effective than purification tablets
yeah...because animals NEVER die in the water or defecate in the water. lol.
There is a 100% chance someone is pissing and shitting upstream and a 200% chance that there are dead animal parts in the water upstream. Choose wisely.
but you can't be ultralight if you pack your own water
Animal carcasses don't have human viruses though, anon. We are different species.
if you don't go /out/ with nothing but a canteen of fresh water, a bowie knife, some fishing line, and the clothes on your back, then you should just stay home or go camping in a designated camp site.
bat soup has stepped in your path, anon.
Have you ever heard of avian flu?
Swine flu?
Bovine encephalitis (mad cow disease)?
you know......
No sack of potatoes? Larper.
the likelihood that I will be the next patient zero for an animal->human pathogen is well.. virtually zero. Bacteria and parasites are the only real concerns and filters filter those.
it's impossible to actually verify. it's all marketing BS. If they get sued they will just take the money and run then declare bankruptcy.
it's truly amazing how gullible the average person is.
you can hunt, fish, and forage. You literally can not consume water without chemicals or meme filters. lol.
huh?
they literally do not. What filter do you use, anon? You should go read the manufacturers testing data. You may be surprised.
good enough for me. My immune system will deal with the 3 or 4 bacteria cells which make it past the filter.
no one who properly uses a filter has gotten a bacterial or parasite infection from river water, correct!
no one
lmfao....
not even one
lmfao....
its impossible
lmfao....
they would have told me about it
lmfao....
0.1 micron

doesn't filter viruses
anon, I have some bad news for your customers
doesn't filter any bacteria smaller than 0.1 micron
anon, I have some bad news for your customers
This whole thread is low effort marketing.
No one is going to buy your chinese meme filters, chang.
You are the one spreading disinfo. I USE A 0.1 MICRON FILTER
In contrast, two different 0.1 microm rated filter types functionally qualified with a specified high titer reduction claim for Acholeplasma laidlawii, were shown to consistently and fully retain H. pseudoflava, and retention by these two filter types was shown to be robust and independent of the challenge duration.
uhhh....anon.....read the abstract.

i have succesfully drank water from every part of finland
ofcourse there are places where that is not possible because of pollution but here it is really rare as you just pointed out

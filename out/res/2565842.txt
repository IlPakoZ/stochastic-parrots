I know most of you are either too young to shave or taking hormones, but for the few men here who shave in camp, what's your normal procedure? Personally, I soak a cloth in 170 degree water, let it cool in the cold mountain air for a moment, and wrap my face in it. I do this twice. I use Cremo shaving cream, applied with clean fingers and massaged in. I shave with a Merkur 45 bakelite safety razor, and rinse well with cool spring water. I do this with a 1 liter pot and a small plastic bowl, a backpacking stove constantly heating water, and two soft cotton cloths.
Holy larp
Ur innawoods just grow out that beard be FERAL
You're not going to do this when you are out.
So we know the two anons who responded are underage redditors or neckbeards in their mom's basement. Men who actually practice personal hygiene and have grooming standards should reply.
Left over hot water and razor, then use a nearby lake as a mirror. Or let it grow and leave till I'm home
I use a lightweight mirror from Shave Well. It's also handy for checking for ticks, and since I floss my teeth everyday, it's indespensable.
Yeah use a knife like the one in pic rel. Make sure its nice and heavy, has good surface area, and you really sharpen it well. Warm up some water and lather over your face to soften up your skin and then use the knife to slit your throat
I should get a mirror, thanks for the reminder.
Rinsing my teeth with water does enough for me
Same here. I love my little mirror!! I find a lightweight mirror is helpful for checking if my asshole is clean or not. Since I need my asshole to be clean for my bf, its indispensable
Just grow a beard, and use the scissors from your first aid/sewing kit to trim it. Three generations of my family have had full beards and still managed to procreate.
shaving while /out/
why? I let it grow wild and shave when I get home. What kind of a prissy nu-male needs a fresh shave every day while camping?
Is this from American Psycho or something? Just grow it out for a month or two, once it gets past like 2 weeks it stops itching and then it's only annoying when eating, but you can trim up the mustache pretty easily with some light scissors that you'll probably have anyway.
fire is quick shave
I used to shave, but it just became too bothersome, I have fully embraced my fantasy dwarf tier beard, Staunining, Marx, 
I've had me beard lower then my clavicle.
Now I just let it grow, ginger beard troll.
Mustache is the most annoying
I've had a full beard for the past 10 years, just started shaving again. It's definitely easier to shave a couple times a week than deal with a huge beard.
Eh, idunno, I've just had a beard for so long I don't recognise myself when I shave, I have an electric shaver and it's pretty good, braiding is comfy too
Why bother? But if you do all you need is hot water, shaving bar soap, a brush and a safety razor or single edge razor. Not exactly heavy equipment.
The military likes to go on two week long car camping/laser tag trips called CTCs. Zog requires us to keep our faces shaved daily. I use my electric razor like everyone else, but we have vehicles to charge them in.
CTCs
That's a funny way to say FTX
You shouldn’t really be shaving if you’re doing any shooting that day. It increases the chance of infections or other bullshit. It’s not too much of any issue anymore, but if you shoot flintlock/percussion cap it’s worth paying attention to. But otherwise I have a straight razor in a tin and cold water. Yeah sure it’s not too comfortable but it’s easy, and you just feel for missed spots/ask a friend for a spot check
Zog requires us to keep our faces shaved daily.
I don't know any military guys, but is there a point to this other than submission? Almost all of the military rules I've heard don't have much to do with combat.
NTA but it's because gas masks that only fit over a cleanshaven face are cheaper than hoods that work with a beard.
My beard hairs tend to get ingrown and shit if I let them grow. Some people didn't get the lion's mane genes, anon.
only pussies shave when they camp/
Ideally use a safety razor and castrate yourself.
shaving in the outdoors
Why?
I don't shave. If I do, it's going to grow back in an instant, and it's not worth shaving every day to look neat when I can just neaten up by combing my beard. To that end, I carry a comb if I think I'll be annoyed by my hair/heard.
If you insist on shaving, you could probably get by with just a decent razor of your choice.
Lack of facial hair betrays a lacking masculinity

Don't be a such a sissyphus
sissyphus
Good one
I'll do it about every three days and wash my hair and take a whore bath at the same time. I'll boil a pot of water, soak a small pack towel to soften the whisker, soap up, ( I've never used shaving cream) and use a safety razor, I'll get 3 or 4 shave out of a blade which lasts for my normal trip time.
Just let it grow.
shaving is for office pussies
What the fuck
i shave my balls with a straight razor and dip them in aftershave
I know most of you are either too young to shave or
ouch... right in the genetics
lol
lmao even
Shaving is for the weak

I just let it grow, both the hair and the sweaters on my teeth.

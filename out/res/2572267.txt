so /out/, how do i into rockclimbing? it seems like a fun thing to do on multi-day hikes, and a cool social sport as well
i'm keen to sign up to a local climbing gym, but beyond hiking and cycling, i'm not in particularly good shape and don't have much in the way of upper body strength
what can i do in terms of calisthenics or other things so i don't embarass myself in front of all the qt girls at the climbing gym?
Climbers are all 18 bmi so thats the first step, do 100 pull ups a day as well
I’m pretty fit and recently got into climbing. I still embarrass myself in front of QTs at the gym. It’s just part of being new.
Daily Pull ups, sit ups, push ups, and squats will help but nothing makes you a better climber than just climbing as much as possible. Technique is as important if not more so than strength. 
Also find a guru and do not start climbing outdoors without a friend who is experienced. When you do feel ready to start going outdoors, take classes at your gym and be wary of climber influencers when it comes to safety stuff. Remember that people on the internet often say wrong things with confidence.
Check the catalog next time and do your own research
The qts at the gym won't acknowledge your existence until v7/5.12
Point is to get into alpinism. Any qt will aknowledge you, when your boner is poking her back when youre hugging for warmth while bivouacing 500m off the ground.
A shit load of grip and upperbody strenght
i control f'd for climbing and this is the only thread
is this not a particularly popular hobby on /out/? i never see generals for it
I've done bouldering for 5 years and my BMI is 28. You can be heavier if you only do bouldering since it's more strenght-based but you need to be much stronger than those twinky types.
I'm skinnyfat and wouldn't consider myself to be very physically fit. But going to the climbing gym once a week (switched to twice recently) made me achieve quite some progress at a decent pace.
It's equal parts strength and technique. Also in the beginning you'll make very rapid progress, because you don't know your limit and will probably fail routes because you're afraid to commit even though you'd be perfectly able to climb them. That goes away with time.
Either way give it a shot, it's a great hobby and I'm glad I found it. Bonus points if you can convince some friends to go with you on a regular basis, it's a great solo sport where you can still just hang out and socialize with your buddies.
This is the real answer. Become a mountaineer. But it ain't for everyone so stick to bouldering and sport climbing if you can't hack it.
Do you know anyone who climbs? That's how I got into it. My friend was a decent climber, with experience and knowledge. I bought my own shoes and harness, and started off outside right away. First some instruction on belaying and tying in on flat ground, then on super easy routes (my first route was rated a European 2). 
If you don't have a friend like that, bouldering in a gym is very accessible. You can do it even if you're alone. 
The qts in the gym will never care about you, by the way. Mount summits, not bitches.
Go to a gym that has bouldering and just start bouldering. Climbing is heavily technique-based so even if you go in super strong, brute forcing your way through climbs is not a good look. Just start, anyone can do it and get stronger by just climbing.

i think you can get away with just 2, a big 3dap and a giga ruck, if you fill them less just sinch them down.
I'd also add an EDC pack that's separate for the fact that it's easier to manage but otherwise you can just do 2.
for example I got a mystery ranch 6500 but you can compress and close the sleeping bag compartment and it becomes a SATL basically.
but since I'm a pack consoomer I was thinking about buying a mid ruck, i just cant decide which, I like the satl, but the ones i find are old gen and have the small hip belt, that concerns me as it seems it may be shit at load bearing, unless you buy a new gen from varuste or some other retailer if it even exists but i was trying to go used so to save some money (I know sellers that hav good condition used stuff), otherwise there's the beartooth 80 which is a very good general purpose ruck and has a cool design with the 270 zipper, but it's expensive too so I might wait a bit before buying. I also like the kifaru 357 mag or the blackjack 50.
has anyone tried the old gen satl? is the small belt really a problem?
btw my 6500 is old gen and has the internal frame instead of the external pike the new gen, is there much of a difference?
mystery ranch makes the best backpacks in all the categories:
EDC
2dap
assault pack
3dap/komodo dragon
ruck
SATL/beartooth 80
6500
for the assault pack category they have high prices, but for the big ruck category all packs are expensive so there's not much of an opportunity cost, anyway in general they're more expensive yes
change my mind
You only need one pack. There is no technical need to own multiple backpacks. Unless you are concerned about wear and tear, durability, looking cool in the city or at work or whereever etc. then get some extra throw-away packs for daily use and stuff.
mystery ranch sucks btw... I tried the MR Terraframe, but still own a worn out exo and a new stone glacier. Difference is night and day.
my 6500 is good
btw only one pack is too little, at least one big and one small/medium, cant EDC a 6500
Things come in different sizes for a reason. I'm quite sure even prehistoric man carried animal hide bags of different sizes for different uses. Since we don't normally kill animals and make bags or packs out of the skins our options are to make packs from modern textiles or buy them. Kudos to the crafty people who make their own, but there's no harm in buying a few packs to suit your needs. The whole "consoom" thing is b.s. when we know we've been buying or trading for things for millennia. If you engage in a few different /out/ activities you might need a few different packs. 
There's no way I'm taking my 75 liter Gregory on a hot weather overnight trip, and no way I'm taking my 40 liter mountain pack on a quick hike when my 22 liter pack is plenty.
It's all about what you need. How long you are going to be in the wilderness, what sort of work you will be doing if any. I think they make both military equipment and civilian packs, but you get standard issue stuff for free.
That being said, if you are in a group, you will want to distribute gear based on weight. In either case, a 50L+ pack can fit your shelter, camping gear, dry food, clothes, fishing/hunting gear, and so on. A 100L pack can fit a lot more, but you may not need it. It is good to pack some sort of gear or purifier for water, so you can refill your canteen or camp water supply in the wild.
Many hunters just go out with a rifle/bow, a knife, and their clothes. There are even those who hunt with just a bow or just a knife as a challenge, and then physically carry the game back like a backpack. If you are hunting while camping, you will have already set down your pack and established your camp, so you won't need to carry your gear on the hunt. Some still carry a smaller pack anyways, and of course extra ammunition if needed. If you are carrying a standard issue or expensive mystery ranch military assault pack, you might also be carrying plates and mags and pouches which would change the entire context.
A civilian style pack is low profile really if you are just hunting or camping. On the hunt with my rifle, I just have my normal clothes and maybe extra cartridges or mags in my pockets or belt. Lightweight, flexible, and good temperature regulation. Pack is at camp or in truck. Mag carriers if it is full auto suppressed hog hunting at night. If the hog can spot you in the dark with mag carriers and goggles and everything, it already knows that it's being hunted. But they can't spot you even up close in the dark, that is a bit of a digression. My point is that you should always carry exactly what you need in each scenario, and noting more or less to be efficient, and you don't need expensive gear, but it is nice if you can afford it.
agree, my point was more on economizing and buying the minimal number of packs, but ofc the optimal is having one for each need 
anyway I ask again about the old gen SATL with the small chip belt bc I need to decide to buy or not from a guy that has them used for 350
Now in some world where hogs have plates and night vision goggles you would have to prepare accordingly. If the hog has plates but doesn't have goggles, or if you have hidden blinds/shelter or thermal sensor concealment gear, that is ideal. If you are running around in actual military gear looking like a paramilitary, the hogs can spot you and got you pretty quick. If you are just looking like a civilian camper or hunter, they are law abiding hogs.
looking cool in the city 
Unironically yes, I am worried about that. That’s normal. Using a giant backpacking pack for everyday stuff isn’t normal. You’re not normal, Anon.
I don’t want to look like a sperg because I’m using a 50L backpack to walk around the park and go on a day trip with my family. The same pack I use for that is perfect for day hikes. 
No. This is retarded. You’re retarded. Everyone can see you’re retardation. A smaller pack isn’t as wide or as thick, so whatever you’re carrying is closer to your center of gravity on a smaller pack.
I've been hearing about those giant 600 pound hogs up in Canada that are sneaking in America. Apparently, they've evolved not just to flourish in cold climates but they also sport turret mounted 50 caliber machine guns. You'll definitely need a mystery ranch pack if you're up against those mothers.
Just get a Flextrek 37 000 000 000.. Only need 1 backpack
Even the 100l does compress down to nothing more than the frame. 
You clearly have no experience with real packs.
Still awkward to carry and you look like a fucking weirdo. 
lol
lmao
protip: if you are running around in actual military gear because it's cheap and/or you're larping, but you don't want to be mistaken for a paramilitary, just add some blaze orange to your outfit and maybe put some reflective tape on some of your shit.
I've seen a guy on my campus wear an outdoor pack to class like that
He looked like a massive fucking autist, and/or a homeless person
you're gonna look autsitic no matter what with a backpacking pack as an edc to school, work, etc. In my office I'd be fired if I brought my ULA pack in. 
That said, nice EXO pack anon, those things are dope. I bet that thing is killer on hunting trips, I wanna get one sometime soon.
Explain
Good thing I don't work in a onions office. At my work you'd get fired for being too gay. 
There is one woman who comes in with a 40-50L Deuter soi pack that isn't half as gay as your ULA pack. I wonder how long she will last. She already complained about "our work culture". Maybe you guys are just gay?

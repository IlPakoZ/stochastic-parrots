This is a general for all australian related /out/ topics
To get you started in this vast country

An app for campgrounds people have visited before.
hiking trials 
Your best bet is just to find something that looks good along your travels and give it ago. Unlikely to be much info online if you're in the middle of nowhere.
Otherwise the national parks are okay.
No big mountains here, so prepare for longer hikes.
For me it's driving, find a short hike, keep driving, and find a spot to camp.
/out/ in aus is best done with 4wd, as the infrastructure sometimes doesn't exist.
Australian /out/ is very different from the us /out/ and deserves its own genny.
I read you guys hunt the wild boar out in the bush, it's an invasive species down here and is tearing up the environment and farms. If you have not watched Razorback (1984) I'd highly recommend it as an Australian movie.
Interesting
Yeah heard some stories about wild boars here.
They get massive and become more carnivorous the deeper you go into the desert
Aussie thread? Fuck yeah. I won't dump pics but I'll drop a few. I spend a lot of time in the high country.
This is the top of Mount Terrible. I've done pretty much all the worst climbs, old zeka creek, billy goat bluff, the haunted stream, etc but the rock climb to get up Mount Terrible was the scariest my back wheels slipped into the ruts in the rock and the 4x4 was pointed right but I was climbing up while moving left.
This was taken on a random track near the Howitt High Planes. 1500m elevation. In 20 minutes it went from being a beautiful clear sky to this with marble sized hail stones.
4wd info
Some essentials for outback
20L per 10hrs of travel when out bush. More if you're a waster
jerry can(s) of diesel or unleaded fuel (depending on car). Depends on tank capcity
high quality clothing, warm for nights when in the desert
moisture/rainproof sleeping equipment
always take backup food 
reliable vechical
ask locals on hiking/driving cond
lock your shit when near abo communities as it WILL get stolen (not a joke)
do not fuck around with skippy or emus. Especially when driving.
fire lighting equipment
repair tools and spares for car
recommended
desert terrain can be rocky, so rolled or ankles is not uncommon, so high support boots or shoes
Currently freezing my ass off somewhere 15km off the nullabor

Damn. It's too flat out there for me. I prefer the mountains of the great dividing range.
I'll check it out.
I'm making my way across to sydney solo
Work decided remote wasn't an option and also forced annual leave.
So why not
Camped in some interesting places so far and found a few great hikes.
It's definitely interesting out there I haven't spent a lot of time in the outback but I've done a bit. If you're going to be near Sydney you're closer to the blue mountains. Im guessing you've got a 4x4 right? If you've got one it's worth checking out. Imo it's the best /out/ part of Australia. One of the longest mountain ranges in the country. If you're into off trail hiking then the great dividing range is the ideal place to do it.
One of the longest mountain ranges in the country
In the world*
first post in an aussie thread
it's about razorback
you literally could not get any more based if you tried mate. fuckin tops
The country is full of pigs and goats. From the outback to the bush. Huge ones and goats. I almost crashed into a massive billy goat while driving through a cloud once.
Will do
Fuck all signal here. Was going to post photos but not enough bandwidth.
4g at campfire but none in the swag.

Surprised you even have 4g out there.
Eucla has 4 bars for 4g

*Decides to live in the middle of fucking nowhere anyway*

Few pics from the last camp/hike I did with the wife in Northern NSW. Our favourite thing is remote hike-in camping but also have a capable 4wd so do a fair bit of beach camping and remote drive-in camping

I don't give a fuck what you want you dumb faggot, learn to read
Anybody know of any good caves that arenâ€™t blocked off, inaccessible or turned into tourist attractions like Chillagoe? I wanna look for some undiscovered cave huntsmans
How far on average do you drive to go /out/
Australia is large.
Any chance you found the track in to the base of Wollomombi Falls? I get out that way a few times a year and have been looking for it for ages now
Nah I'm not from the area, was just visiting some friends so we only went as far as the little water hole near the lookout. We're going to have a proper explore next time we're down there

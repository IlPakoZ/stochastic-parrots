What are some good things to do in Minnesota? I plan to visit soon, my main interests are hiking, maybe try hunting and fishing (never done those two before, but I want to try.)
Here are the legal hunting seasons, should give you idea of what you can hunt.

Very friendly people up there, Midwest America, gets very cold and snowy. Check out national parks and national forests, as well as land management areas for hunting. You just need a license. Course you can hike and camp without needing a license if you choose.
On private land, which people lease out for hunting and fishing, it's different. That is how a lot of people hunt and fish though, but I'd only pay to hunt if you need a guide. I am a hunter myself, and I can also take people out for free.
The land was settled in large part by Scandinavians and you can kinda hear it in the local accent. Good food and very down to Earth out there in Minneh-soh-tah, pretty rural too. You still have Minneapolis and St Paul for larger cities.
I'd also consider paddling a canoe or a kayak out on the water if you go fishing, or renting out a boat, even a small one.
People love catching these big ol Walleyes man that's a bigass fish. Good for catch and cook on a campfire or a grill.

you can do a lot of outdoor stuff- hiking, biking, paddling, a little climbing, lots of fishing, boating ect...Its relatively flat with prairie and farms in the southern half and more glaciated lakes and pine forests in the north, with a beautiful coast along lake Superior. One national park (voyaguers) and the BWCA which make for amazing canoe camping...Getting out on the water one way or another is primo MN experience

I would only charge people as a hunting guide if it were for difficult and dangerous game like cougars, bears, and gators. That just seems fair to me. I grew up hunting deer as a kid, and we hunted as a family with our family friends as one big party and community. It was not a commercial thing, but a traditional way of life. If you are competent, you can solo hunt if you choose.

They love catching muskies more. Big walleyes dont taste as good as the smaller ones lol
That's a cool looking fish.

I am a NEET who thought about living in the woods in a tent. how fucked am i? 
will i die like alexander supertramp? 
i have like 2000 dollars to buy gear and supplies
You're fucked, retarded, and will die. Also kill all homeless.
Do it but learn enough to make sure that you have a good chance of not dying. Even dying in the woods I'd preferable to kike society.
Kys wagie
You really think you're being edgy huh? 
Instead of projecting your self harm fetishes onto others. Just fucking off yourself already anon. There's no point. Your will to live is the only reason your alive. Go ahead and overcome it.
for $2000 you can get a nice kit. if you stayed near the west coast or below the mason-dixon line you can easily live outdoors year round. food is always the big problem, i doubt you have ever been truly starving and how awful it makes you feel. unless you are raiding dumpsters or stealing how are you going to feed yourself?
food banks
expired food from jumpsters
begging(this would be last resort)
free samples
finding money on the ground near phonebooths 
i practice 24 hour fasts on a regular basis
Hey friend. I used to be NEET for 3-4 years. Had same vague aspirations as you to go 'live in the woods'. I'm now homesteading and raising livestock/poultry as well as agriculture. Did have to work for it, am still working here and there but am transitioning to living from farming. I never went the nomadic route but I do love roughing it in the mountains for days on end and I love the natural world as much as anyone. I've still got it in the back of my head to strike out McCandless style one day but for now I've got obligations here. I enjoy working on my farm, I know what it feels like to never think you'll be able to work but 'waging' in the typical McDonald's fry cook or Walmart stocker is not all there is to do and there is dignified work that is paid in an hourly wage, stuff that pays well too like manual labor. It's a means to and end and you won't have to do it for too long if you can live frugally and make smart decisions. 
You can be able to work, a person has a natural need to exert themselves toward things and you will find out if you go out in the wilderness McCandless style that you just landed in a full time mandatory overtime job, a great and fulfilling one if you know what you are doing and can take care of yourself. Old man told me once that work is just a four letter word. Humans 'work' to survive in the wild, it is the conditions of modern work that make it so our brains don't fully compute it with total fulfillment the way a wild man is totally fulfilled by his work. However, you can still be better off psychologically working a job with a goal in mind.
All that being said, I don't know you and maybe you do have the skills to do this. Knowing what most NEETs are like though it's not likely so I'm assuming not. If you don't, then at least practice them for a couple months and see how long you can realistically feed yourself first with 1 or 2 days then more and more. Godspeed
What year is this?
buy land 
find a way to get water to drink and wash 
plant potatoes and raise chickens 
sleep in a tent 
start from there and build up Idk 
probably completely fucked if you don't even have a place to sleep and wash and a way to eat for a while
where people take out money from their pockets. that's what i mean. they usually drop money
Stay away from bears and wolves, they will use your naivity against you very effectively.
I don't think you'll die like him because he lived in a bus and you'll be inatent
There's a film about this called "Leave no Trace". 
The times I've tried to camp on the edge of towns and cities have been full of paranoia and sleepless nights. Better to read some self help books like think and grow rich, then go after your dreams instead of trying to barely exist as an outcast wasting your life.
youd be better off killing yourself and donating the money
This is my first time visiting this board, and this was exactly the reason why I came here. I have around 2.2k in cash, and I am trying to gather as much information as possible on what I need to survive a 3-month trip in the wilderness. During the first few weeks, I could probably survive on spam while I learn to catch food. I have never fished in my life, but I should have some luck with a net instead of a fishing pole. If I have a reliable way of starting a fire, I guess I can just boil my drinking water. I'll buy a tent and a sleeping bag for the warmth and when may starts rolling in it should only get easier. If all fails and i end up breaking a foot in the middle of the jungle I still have a poison pill with me.
There’s a lot wrong with this sentence, ignorant even. If you wanna kill yourself there’s faster ways to do it.
Been out here 7 years thanks to crypto. Say that to my face wagie
Nevermind yeah this guy is fucked kek
The plan was to overdose in some far-out forest anyway, but I'm fit and healthy, so why not try at least? I have the whole of the EU to choose a nice forest with a running river and a nice distance between the trees. The hardest part might actually be not getting caught by the authorities in three months' time.
This is why you’ll fail.
100% this guy is dead on week 1
I'd buy a horse and a bedroll and ride through the plains. I'd do that cause I'm not gay.
Nice. Where you at? What do you do for food / money?
Maybe the eastern parts at best, yet...
Don't be surprised, this is literally the first question every newfag asks. Every Single Week
wilderness
Please define “wilderness.” How far from civilization will you be? How do you realistically plan on getting there?
spam for a few weeks
There are much better options. 
never fished, but I can
Lol
boil drinking water
There are much better options, specifically filters or chemicals.
Spring has warmer temps but some pretty gnarly storms.
I like these running away from home posts but they never seem to have the ability to plan anything, nor have they done much research.
top kek. You're at the stage now where you don't know what you don't know. If you attempt it now you will surely perish.
I need to practice making fire without tools.
Should be downhill from there.
Fishing isn't that hard, and im sorry that you feel the need to validate spending $6,589 on gear that realistically is no better than something you can buy for $100-$200.
Fishing is very hard if you're starting from a point of zero knowledge.
Larp on 4chan
silence, demon
Well, the rope escape is probably closer to your values than what's coming for you, 
the pending pendulum back swing against tolerating the mentally ill is going to coincide with the emergence of technology allowing objective tests for mental illness, and we all know as soon they put that helmet on your head it's going to show them your not so hidden turd brain, then off to the bughouse with you, and you aren't getting out till they fix you, one way or another.
Fishing takes some time to learn if you've never done it before.
Tying knots can be a bitch, no bites can be frustrating, &amp; finding good locations takes a lot of trial and error.
They’re the confluence of naïveté, nihilism, and hubris.
3 months in decent weather? Sure . Long term without a bankroll? NFC.
There’s a reason homeless people suffer in cities vs striking out into the woods.
there arent crack dealers in the middle of the woods
True, that’s some of them.
if true I'm including those who dont have legal ownership as well
welcome to the edible pine tree timeline anons
Anon atleast get a job and save up for a year to buy an acre with a pretty rural area in Utah or something with a few more supplies. Tents get damaged incredibly easy and you dont want to hit a rough patch while in the dead of winter
Remember that guy from alone Mongolia who ate so much xylem that they had to air vac him to China for bowel surgery?
based woodeater
I found a twenty on the ground like a week ago. a few months back, I myself lost about that much too.
its not repeatable necessarily, but you could probably find a pretty penny on occasion.
Darwin would be making field notes
any retard can spare money living with parents and doing 2 months of work lol 
no one is dumb enough to start anythign with 2k lol
chris knight did it for 20 years before he got caught for breaking in to people's homes
The gradual schizofication of a person that kept wanting to struggle more and more to survive is not what someone who wants to live offgrid wants, people here want to basically camp outside of a city not go to Alaska unprepared and wing it
You'll probably die during the winter unless you're already an expert survivalist.
There's a big difference between surviving innawoods in summer vs in winter.
In summer there's mostly minor annoyances like bugs to worry about. In winter it's low temperatures, shit weather and no game. Good luck.
This, anon needs to save up and get an actual job for a while to atleast get an RV. In my rural town in Utah we get alot of the off grid types basically live/park in Walmart parking lots because they cant survive the winter outside of civilization
Yet here we are
yes, you will die a painful, embarrassing death.
Work outdoors, earn an income, build skills until you're competent
Also, you didn't even mention hobopunk/EBTpunk/bennymaxxing. The average bum in Santa Monica or Seattle gets ~$700 month + medicaid + EBT
I would suggest don't do it. You probably can't handle it. I'm and passionate outdoors and I still return to society.
You can also chew fresh pine resin as chewing gum
ForestAnon did it, look up his youtube channel. He survives mainly on flour, pine stuff, homemade booze, and noodles that he buys with thr small jons on farms he does from time to time. Everyone here knows that guy
I would kill you before you could ever enact this idea.
Proof that homeless people are murderers.
Is it literally ForestAnon?
not where i live they don't
People hate these posts because you faggots almost never actually go through with it.
You mean never.
but yes, it's never about actual doing, it's about getting people to idly fantasize with them, just like degenerates trying to get randoes to go jerk off with them on their discord servers.
Don’t listen to this fagge
I remember that idiot. Didn’t he even say something along the lines of I don’t even have to hunt, I can just eat bark the entire time. Tard. Reminded me of that young guy from the first season who was arrogant as shit and fucked everything up
Nope. That schizo from Portland went through with it. He flew to Orlando with brand new gear from Walmart and attempted to walk back. He lasted two days. He still checks the board too.
So in other words
He failed.
Also noticed nobody ever tells the faggot to get a secondhand tent from goodwill and go camp for a weekend, you know to see how it be like.
Someone post the maladaptive daydreaming pic
Get a job and start saving up and buy a car. Then you can go camping whenever you want. Also get some friends and a girlfriend/boyfriend
If you learn primitive shelter, fire making, fishing and water cleaning techniques, surviving in the wild isn't that difficult. Obviously knowing how to identify edible plants and how to hunt land/air animals is beneficial, but in my experience it's less useful if you're talking about long-term wilderness living without resupplies. 
Chris' mistake was setting off into Alaska without first having a solid grasp of survival in a more lenient environment.
I think if you're starting from literally 0 wilderness experience, it'd be ideal to first find a survivalist class to learn basics in a safe setting.
It's a fun hobby, but I don't think I'd want to live in the wilderness for an indefinite period of time. Just being out there for 4 weeks starts weighing on me mentally.
Trying and failing absolutely means he went through with it. Failure could have only happen if he tried, which he did.
Retard
Pretty safe, luckily we haven’t evolved yet for thoughts to be anything more than thoughts. That was a close call though anon, thinking is tough stuff.
Don’t name call. If you disagree with someone, explain what it is you have an issue with. Use your words.
I do crypto and thanks to infinite unemployment covid inflation, I work odd jobs in spring/summer
I'm in the PNW area
Woah classic haha. OK kill yourself REI fag
Recently I spent a week here while banned from /biz/ trying to give advice, I got called a larp, people made fun of my knives, people made fun of my jacket, food choices, using basic bitch walmart filter/tent.
No fucking shit people actually /out/ give up on this shithole
I'm not surprised that you had that experience here. This board is fucking dogshit because of the hostile gatekeeping faggots who drive away the good posters and the ones just getting into /out/
Examples from another board of what a good, knowledgeable, supportive community looks like: 
/out/ is a lost cause. Even /trv/ is better these days. A few Dunning-Kruger faggots have successfully turned this board from a comfy hangout to one of the worst boards 4chan. All in the span of three years or so.
how do you trade crypto? where is the best place to start learning?
go watch alone. the most important attribute you need is being an introvert that doesn't need other people around, or you'll start crying in a week or 2
Took me 12 months to start crying about missing my mum. Then i jacked off while completely naked on the beach while finger blasting my asshole. The world was ok once again for awhile but then I had to go to prison for awhile, apparently doing that on a public beach is not allowed.
Keep the money. 
Just have some clothing and a cheap first aid kit.
Maybe get rice, sugar etc
Get some books on local fauna and flora of that area.
Go there and ration you supplies while reading about what you can and cant eat
After a while you will then know what gear you will need to spend or save to get.
simply not enough animals to eat anymore, without hunting linving in the woods is absolutely imopssible
Maybe with that attitude. Dont listen to this coward
Even without animals you can survive on perseved foods but you need to supplement with fresh plants especially vitamin c. 
Obviously you still need some income to buy preseved food. But with no overheads this could be something nearby a few times a year... Gardening or something idk
If you're in north America you're already on easy mode
consider using that money to rent for like a fortnight and working at a macdonalds, you will probably not die that way
Bored and back in mummy's house in a fortnight with a load of out gear you'll never use again or sell, because it'll be cheap shit.
Bro just keep the 2k.
Get yourself up to one of the big west coast cities. Like Portland or Seattle or LA or San Fran. Find the closest store that has gear like REI (if Portland go now they gonna close). 
So you just get a big cart and fill it up with gear and just go out of the store. No one will stop you not even the cops. Kinda hurry because they might try to close the doors if you have a lot of stuff but you can just start yelling about having to go take your meds and they will let you out.
Bro I know this first hand you can get a lot of great gear this way. I traded out of all my Walmart stuff doing this I got all good shit now.
Decent "land" starts at $250,000 USD. If you're coming from a NEET position, that'd take a decade or more.
I feel like the next best thing to doing what he did is just living in a van.
if you can't get gun for hunting then just make snares.
https://www.youtube.com/c/Meattrapper/videos
it's so easy to catch a deer
are you gay?
You don't need $2,000.
You can survive with $0.
But you won't have the benefits of modernity.
Like modern medicine or science and technology.
This is just how the Indigenous man lived before colonization.
You can always get a place out in the country, with a steady income and a job.
Then you can enjoy being out in nature, while also enjoying things like hospitals and the internet and trucks and computers.
If you just want to get out in nature and backpack for a while, for weeks, for months, then get a solid pack, like 50L or 100L pack.
Then you can pack a camp, a means to purify water, a weapon/traps for fishing and hunting, a tool like an axe for building shelter.
This is how the Indigenous man lived, it's not far off from how a lot of rednecks live up here, and people on reservation land.
You can even camp with just a tarp and no tent, or build your own shelter, like bushcraft or traditional shelters.
You can get away with stealth camping, but at some point, the ranger may catch on to you and confront you.
If you are on public land, the park ranger will be on your tail, and you will have to move a lot.
You have 14 days, two weeks, within a 28 day period to camp on public land.
If you want to just be a vagrant, then hop between different sites.
I've been homeless, just doing migrant labor, lived in a shelter though.
Living like a wild man is certainly doable, but you will miss civilization and you will need a woman some day.
If you refuse to leave and insist on living on God's green Earth in a traditional way, you will go to jail.
But not on reservation land. Just respect the environment, cleaning your traces hides your trail too.
And the Earth outlives governments every single time, so this may change. It's a constant back and forth, our fishing rights are a sacred matter.
By that, I mean different parks. I have gone on long journeys across this country and just found shelter by camping on public lands and campsites, as well as hotels/hostels and such now and then as a treat. This land is vast and beautiful, full of bounty and majesty.
If you can't survive society, you can't survive innawoods.
If you're neet, there is something fundamentally wrong with you that will, likely slowly and insidiously, fuck you over.
Im not saying this to make fun of you, im saying to stress that mental health is the most important aspect. 
Maybe you have a lack of motivation, maybe you struggle with depression, maybe you just never learned to apply yourself, maybe you just can't take the suck (of a job or school), whatever. It's always something. Don't feel shame, get help and fix yourself up. It'll be okay.
I believe anyone can survive with godlike will and wit, but you better be damn sure you qualify in that regard.
Kys.
You're a retard. You'll be in tears after 2 weeks in the woods.
lol. lmao even. wanna know how you survive a 3 month trip into the wilderness for real? you walk into the nearest town once every week or two and resupply. youre not jeremiah johnson.

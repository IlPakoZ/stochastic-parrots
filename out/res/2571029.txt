I'm a young guy from Canada and I would like to live in the wild yada yada.
I have over 10k saved up, I could go on a trip and buy the supplies and tools I need and drive far to a random spot where nobody could find me and start my new life there. 
The problem is the way the PAL (canadian firearms licence) works could be a problem if I were to live in the wilderness, since here in canada there's all sorts of bs and you have to renew your licence and you need a legal place of residence and they keep track of where you store your guns etc. etc. So it wouldn't work long-term if I lived off-grid. At some point I would lose my ability to acquire ammo.
An american could do odd jobs here and there and buy ammo whenever and wherever since it's a right, as long as they are not a felon it's nobody's business.
This is the only roadblock left for my plan to live in the wilderness, I don't wanna rely on bow and arrows since I don't want to get mauled/stomped to death by any predators/large animals. Also guns are just cool and part of the appeal, I like to imagine myself living in the woods with a rifle slung over my shoulder, yes I know it's LARP.
How do I get around this? Is there a way I could move to the US and make it work in less than a decade? What can I do?
There are plenty of men on this board who would marry you, and once you've been together for two years you can divorce and still maintain your path to citizenship.
muh gunnnzzzzz
Wrong fucking board go complain on >>>/k/
fuck off guns are /out/ you shut in mong, fuck off to r/hiking if you dont want to hear about guns
this guy lurks /out/ 24/7 to post this same picture in any thread that mentions guns

I'm at least going to need consummation before I agree to these terms.
sure and you bottom
Buy a lot
Then it "falls off a boat"
if you can wait a year, your healthcare system will be happy to help you with that crushing misery.
What are the air rifle laws in Canada? They make some crazy powerful ones these days. The US is tough as the more remote the area the less likely you'll be accepted in the community and find work. Maybe Alaska?
Tell them that you lost your guns in a boating accident so you don't need to renew em. And honestly, what you're doing sounds awesome man, hope it goes well, Lord be with you
Be careful not to end up like chris mccandles
They passed laws that target air rifles too
Liberal retards flood the board with retardation about guns regularly and get shot for being retards
Liberal retards think everyone who disagrees with their shit logic and dishonest facts MUST be the same person reeeee
imagine being you...

Bro this is called living in rural America and going hunting it's not that big of a deal ain't gotta live like Uncle Ted or some guy from some movie. I've got a computer and internet bro, water and climate control, we are not living in tents.
Going hunting is not a huge deal and it can provide a lot of food or even provide a good living if you are a skillful hunter.

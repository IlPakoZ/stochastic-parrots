My friend and I are looking to get out and explore the no-man's land between Worcester and the Quabbin. 
Mass is retarded though and there's generally no dispersed camping allowed. 
We're generally thinking to try the mid-state trail, park somewhere, walk in and hope we find somewhere half-way decent to spend the night.
Short of that, any other suggestions or pointers?
Why's it so damned hard to just spend the night in the woods not surrounded by people?
Camping where I wasn't supposed to with my friends was the norm where I come from. They still do it. Just don't set up near the parking lot and try to set up far enough from the trail where light or noise is blocked....the other side of a hill is ideal.
To piggyback onto this, staying out of sight and sound can be easier or harder depending what you want to do while camping. You can stealth camp, making no noise, only cooking on a gas stove if at all, or you can be a loud fuck blaring music with a massive fire. As long as you're somewhere in between, closer to the quiet end, nobody will have a problem with you or even notice you.

Maybe because youâ€™re an hour and a half away from the Boston metro area containing 4.5 million people and about three hours from New York City which is probably 15 million or something ridiculous.
By that, I meant why is it not possible to do so legally. Mass has a lot of state forests and similarly designated land, you just can't camp in then for some reason.
I'll steer clear of the Rutland camp.
Honestly if you want to, just do it. I've wild camped enough to realise people don't care. You can mitigate risk by not carrying weapons/tools whatever but no one will mind you setting up a tent and cooking some grub in the woods

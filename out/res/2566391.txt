drain it because "muh agriculture"
are californians seriously this retarded
Do you seriously not know by this point that most californians are everything you ever dreamed retarded could be, and more?
he doesn't know that the average IQ of Californians is more than a standard deviation lower than Missouri
Was it dumb? Extremely, of course the time it happened, ecological destruction wasn’t really considered much anywhere…the problem now however, is the entire country is dependent on California’s agriculture industry. If it dries up the price of produce, fruit, nuts, and dairy products will not only skyrocket but become relatively hard to come by.
You know anon, I think I can do without almonds and overpriced mid tier wine for a good while.
hurrdurr
yup. thats all CA produces- just almonds and wine
Wine doesn't grow in the valley friend
West coast retards maybe. Midwest can support everything east of the rockies.
The Tulare lake bed is all cotton farms owned by one rich fucker that doesn't need the money and we don't need the cotton. 
I hope it gets flooded to the maximum possible depth.
fuck the wealthy landowners. glad their shit got ruined. I hope it stays flooded forever.
It was not intntionally drained, they just took to much water out of the rivers around.
Wrong, it was intentionally drained.
Isn't there a lake near LA that was drained and the City &amp; State have spent millions of dollars on dust mitigation from the dry lake bed, rather than just filling it up with water again?
Forget it, it’s Chinatown
Almonds is where all the water goes. And the almonds go to China
You're probably thinking of Salton Sea. Which was manmade kinda by accident. I dont think turning on a hose to fill up a saltwater lake is the best use of water for a state in a 30 year drought.
Kino.
Owens Lake, which is appearing again. 
Massive dust pollution- arsenic, cadmium, nickel and salt. It blows around at 30X federal limits for exposure. 
Rolling for an LA tsunami of epic size.
Not a civil engineer but I imagine if those fucks can steal water from Colorado River they can figure out a way to steal water from the fucking ocean and dump it there
Almonds is where all the water goes
all the water
all
the almonds go to China
Since the trump tariffs China has fallen to 4th largest export market for CA almonds/
It even has its own meteorological condition called Keeler fog, when those white dust clouds blow up you'd better gtfo that area unless you like inhaling carcinogens in the &lt;10 um range.
It's the largest single source of dust pollution in North America.
mfw Californians actually believe this
My mistake then regarding exports. But almonds are by far the largest consumer of water, apologies for the hyperbole but I assumed you’d understand I didn’t mean all water in California went towards them.
The Salton sea is also a major dust source, and it will become an even bigger problem than Owens lake in a decade or two. Kids living in that area have asthma at twice the rate of the rest of the US. As the Salton dries up it's going to expose many more square miles of stinking dust, let's hope for East winds that blow it directly at LA.
Stop growing nuts negro, but at the same time you mudskins better keep growing them because I love pistachios. That being said, I worked in produce for nearly a decade here in flyover mountain land and most of our produce (75ish% compared to 25% domestic) was from Mexico with pretty much only nuts from California
Also Owens Lake.
Not a civil engineer either, and fuck the LADWP, Los Angeles in general but especially Hollywood, every pus leaking cunt who voted for Gavin Newsom, and many other state, county, and municipal water agencies and departments, but everybody who's trying to "save the Salton Sea" is a cretinous bastard who is making money from this fake environmental issue. Let it dry up as nature intends. 
As a kid in the late 1960s I used to boat and fish on the Salton Sea every year. Good times but that was then, this is now, and we should focus on preserving what's left of the Colorado River.

oh no we can't buy almonds or California wines 
Fine price to pay
It really sucks knowing how good California COULD be, but isn't
I seriously wish God would stop teasing and finally earthquake the San Andreas fault while a massive forest fire is going on.
Take out the garbage and drop the property value so /out/ists can rightfully reclaim what's theirs.
It really sucks knowing how good California COULD be, but isn't
"Such are the people who inhabit a country embracing four or five hundred miles of sea coast, with several good harbors; with fine forests in the north; the waters filled with fish and the plains covered with thousands of herds of cattle; blessed with a climate, than which there can be no better in the world; free from all manner of diseases, whether epidemic or endemic; and with a soil in which corn yields from seventy to eighty fold. In the hands of an enterprising people, what a country this might be! we are ready to say. Yet how long would a people remain so, in such a country? The Americans (as those from the United States are called) and Englishmen, who are fast filling up the principal towns, and getting the trade into their hands, are indeed more industrious and effective than the Spaniards; yet their children are brought up Spaniards, in every respect, and if the "California fever" (laziness) spares the first generation, it always attacks the second."

The entire west makes so much more sense when you realize it was populated by the people who couldn’t make it in the east.
All coasties are equally trash
That should happen though, we shouldn’t be that dependent on one state to feed a continent.
california is all midwesterner transplants from the 1800s
Imagine not even being able to make it in the midwest
dust bowl and gold rush you absolute retarded
dust bowl
Couldn’t make it in the Midwest, like we said. Imagine being proud of being descended from the people who wrecked Oklahoma and were too dumb to make a living despite that.
49ers were a tiny fraction of Californians, and gold rush chasers are generally all morons or crooks who are looking to exploit the morons.
the washington/oregon/idaho trifecta completely mogs california in terms of agriculture
in terms of agriculture
How so? CA produces almost 3x the amount in ag$ as those 3 states combined.
just to feed the state of california alone, california only feeds itself.
california only feeds itself.
derp
stfu
Weren't you banned for repeated shitposting?
He isn't entirely wrong, in terms of total output to population CA is only a little higher than parity. The majority of its output is sold in the general region except for more "exotic" crops like fruits, nuts and greens in which it dominates. For example, CA produces around 13% of the US's total agriculture output as a state, however it contains 12% of the US total population as well. Midwestern and PNW states are actually proportionally more food secure than CA and proportionally export more.
being able to feed itself with such a high population and GDP is an accomplishment. some countries can't even feed themselves
49ers were a tiny fraction of Californians
false
It was a large percentage of them at the time
I'll never understand the retards who screech about 
California is where most food comes from
No its not. The largest share of the SAD (Standard American Diet) comes from processed carbohydrates like white bread and white flour. Corn is grown in the corn belt of the midwest and the US has basically given up on producing wheat although there is a north-south wheat belt from roughly eastern Montana to about the panhandle of Texas. Maybe the American diet should be different but its not. 
California produces more than just organic wine, almonds, and oat milk. We also make real milk
California sells ~milk~ not dairy products. Milk as a product has one of the highest number of derivatives for any agricultural product. California produces relatively little butter, ice cream, cream, sour cream, yogurt, etc. If you want to go down the rabbit whole on this the department of agriculture also retardedly measures milk production in pounds. It also doesn't standardize for water content in the milk.
The dust bowl largely wasn't midwestern phenomenon. Texas and Oklahoma were the hardest hit and they aren't part of the midwest.
the man who did it was from the South
OP, I don't know how to tell you this, you might want to take a seat..
Nah California is huge, aint nothing special in their ability to make food which even the massive indian population (200k-2million where most indian cunt outside of mesoAmerica were sparsely populated nomads) that was here before whitey was able to do since the valley is so fertile. California doesnt have a water problem either? they have a retarded lust for money problem that they willingly fuck over their soil and potential to make a quick buck on cash crops
overpriced mid tier wine
t. Seething French fag
Almonds is where all the water goes.
Nigger, the farmers own the water rights. They've been using the same amount for crops for over a century. If you banned almonds tomorrow, they would just grow peaches or tomatoes or watermelon or weed. 
Almonds are the worst nut and I think less of anyone who consumes them. But the fact is that you can grow food in the desert, or you can grow cities in the desert. But you can't do both.
He isn't entirely wrong
yes he is. He stated CA "only feeds itself" which is simply not factual. Moreover, ID couldnt feed it self it it tried.
Weren't you banned for being a fucking retard?
Idaho

Nigger do you not pay attention to the french fry bags or potatoes your depressed mom buys your manchild ass?
Imagine growing up in and never leaving the town your ancestors from 300 years ago (who did the same exact thing) settled in.

MFW California's agricultural based economy as a state competes with most COUNTRIES. Seethe poorfags no one will miss your state which contributes so little to the GDP of our great nation. 
MFW no face
It is factual. CA if it stopped exporting and importing food from everywhere else right now, would be barely scraping by by the next growing season in domestic supply and demand. ID on the other hand, produces ~3.27 times the amount of food it needs to feed its near 2 million population from POTATOES ALONE. It also grows a large amount of wheat and has a large stock of cattle as well. There are other states in the Midwest that also blow ID out of the water in domestic production vs domestic use.

Yeah I forgot Californians only ate cock
California's industry is a result of ww2, during which VAST, ENORMOUS sums of money from all states were poured into the west coast, essentially overnight, all to support the Pacific theater of the war. 
Did California pay back any of that after? Nope. They kept it all and the industry on top. And a few decades later they think they did it all themselves.
This is why everybody hates you, you know.
projection

This is why everybody hates you, you know
Fuck off that was long before any of us were born
Did California pay back any of that after?
lol California has been a net giver to Federal coffers for decades. CA recives the least amount of federal aid per capita by far. $12 per person from the federal govt...as opposed to VA which is $10,000
Wasn't even agriculture.
It was swimming pools and lawn care.
hmmmm not eat some walnuts or end up without any source of water west of the Rocky Mountains?
Honestly if your gov wasn't retarded you would have just desalinated water...
Yeah not like those rugged flyover farmers. They would never take a dime from the feds.
You mean flyover farms are taking back the money that was stolen
this level of mental gymnastics
As much as I dislike the current state of CA politics, I can't help to ask what level of reality jumping do people do to say shit like that.
CA is a net drain on the system not a net positive. Look at all the liberal bullshit you vote in now. And consider the enormous investments mentioned in the post you just responded to. California is a shithole. Outside of Silicon valley and Hollywood there isn't much production of anything. Sure there's illegal immigrants working in the fields. But the immigrants get on the first bus out of town that they can afford and move somewhere else. The agriculture they work on isn't essential food for the most part. California's agriculture is dominated by high dollar value products like organic food, fruits, and nuts. Outside of tomatoes the average american probably doesn't eat anything produced in california on a day-to-day basis.
Souce, my ass
Outside of Silicon valley and Hollywood there isn't much production of anything.
You're just buying into the seethe the rightwing has against CA since the end of the Regan days. There is so much to CA it's truly mind boggling, Aerospace, Defense contracting, Finance, energy, tourism, Oil&amp;gas, Military, Fishing and so much more. 
Outside of tomatoes the average American probably doesn't eat anything produced in California on a day-to-day basis.
If anything CA produces too much and we have dependency on CA for fruits and nuts 
Even with the most basic research one can tell you how fucking wrong you are. So much of our produce is tied in with CA to the point its a huge concern when issues like water and natural disasters happen because we are so dependent on it. You can hate CA and its politics and there is much to be desired but only a retard would believe that CA is anything but a Massive economic and cultural entity in the world.
CA accounts for a quarter of all food production in the country. You're out of your element, Donny.
All you grow is corn and søy. No real vegetables or fruit.
Imagine being so lazy that you stopped halfway to California because you couldn't walk any further. When I use to spend time in Nebraska this girl I knew would always joke that the Midwest was just full of the fat failures who got tired walking to Oregon and California. Only the best or fittest could make it to California before the trains and later car made it accessible.
you watch that chick on instagram who does lake facts don't you? Not a bad channel honestly
California has the 8th largest economy in the world.
13%, and most of that is lower calorie food and milk. And the states population is 12% of the US total.

Only the best or fittest could make it to California before the trains and later car made it accessible.
But it's actually not true for midwestern land, the western Midwest (western NE, SD, ND) is not very desirable since the land is so dry and unproductive. Most settlers to the Midwest we're destined to end their voyage in the Midwest because of the homestead act and rich farming soil. Literally all my family immigrated and came to the midwest in the 1870s-1880s when rail to the West Coast was possible and were just interested in the quarter section of homestead they were entitled to if they farmed and maintained it, it's kind of funny because that soil is some of the most valuable and productive farming soil in the world now and they paid almost nothing. Also corn is grown for economic reasons, it's really hard on the soil but corn is the modern day cash crop per acre, if you eat meat of any sort, the overwhelming majority of cattle, pig, and poultry are corn fed. Also muh ethanol is very profitable but that's just because the government wants to wealth transfer money from the rich coastal regions inland in the form of subsidies since technically natural gas/diesel fuel is consumed in the fertilizer and the planting/harvesting respectively of the corn. Guess it's a cheap way to convert CH4 and a bit of diesel into a larger quantity of burnable (or drinkable) ethanol which will stretch the life of our petroleum reserves out.
California has different farming infrastructure, they can get five planting seasons or more if weather cooperates, soil can be used year round with a massive amt of fertilizer. The actual vegetables most people eat day to day are sourced in CA or from abroad as you can get fresh carrots/broccoli/peas/etc. in December in colder states as a result so all the infrastructure for that type of crop is built there. Lastly the brightest are no longer flocking to CA, the state is losing people can you guess what kind of people are leaving?
Not everyone believes in generational wealth and that’s okay anon, no need to get defensive.
And you cocksuckers claimed “inheritance” while also demanding liberal social Justice without even recognizing the irony.
There is so much to CA it's truly mind boggling, Aerospace, Defense contracting, Finance, energy, tourism, Oil&amp;gas, Military, Fishing and so much more.
And every one of those industries is leaving because nobody can do anything in CA anymore.
If anything CA produces too much and we have dependency on CA for fruits and nuts
I don't eat fruit or nuts on a daily basis.
It is you who needs to do the basic research. I'd say pick up a book but really just pick up a newspaper. You talking points come straight from the 90's. I'd also say leave CA but really we don't want your kind anywhere so please stay there and get gang raped by niggers and spics with ads.
All you grow is corn and søy. No real vegetables or fruit.
This is a stupid argument. Corn and onions are also used as a animal feed. Chicken, beef, and pork are derivative products of corn and onions. Try to do some basic research before commenting.
So? You don't eat dollar bills. California's production is mostly intangibles like entertainment and highly speculative technology startups. That plus some prestige products like wine and organic fruit. This isn't the 1940's where California was booming and it still had the oilfields and manufacturing. I've been to the rust belt and honestly its doing better right now than most of California.
hold the fuck on
france lost in WINE?
TO CALIFORNIA?
Yep
every one of those industries is leaving
memetake. not factual. hysterical reeeing from Fox news
Edwin Sarkassian is a lakedrying faggot.
Yes, it's unironically an issue. People saying otherwise is cope. The rest of country destroys itself with corn and onions. Other states currently aren't growing as much as they think they are. Commiefornia is retarded and shitty but it's fact it grows a lot of the food the country is dependent on.
False, but feel free to prove the vital exports California sends to the rest of the US (hint, it’s mostly nuts)
Not that anon. When you say nuts I have to say that it is specifically true nuts. Us production is pretty much everywhere that isn't California. Peanuts are mostly a south eastern crop[0] while peas are mostly a cold climate crop[1]. California doesn't even crack the top 5 states ranked in bean production [2]

It is impressive how ill informed you are.
the vital exports California sends to the rest of the US (hint, it’s mostly nuts)
Try again. Over a third of the country’s vegetables and three-quarters of the country’s fruits and nuts are grown in California. 
California is also 4th in beef production...
California is also the top dairy producing state.
That sounds like bs, considering how much of the land there is federally owned and pretty much uninhabitable and the urban sprawl on top of that there wouldn't be much rook for that sort of thing. If you drive through Kansas you can see the entire state is practically used for agriculture even close to city limits in the actually populated areas. I imagine Cali is on par with Florida except for being trillions in debt by comparison and drier instead of humid.
That sounds like bs considering how much of the land there is federally owned and pretty much uninhabitable and the urban sprawl on top of that
maybe if you left your mother's basement you would see for yourself what reality is like? That it sounds like BS to you is due to only your wilful ignorance and bias. 
The Central Valley is about 450 miles long, from Bakersfield up to Redding, and is 60 miles at its widest, between the Sierra Nevada to the east and the Coast Ranges to the west. It’s larger than nine different states, but size is only one of its defining characteristics: the valley is the world’s largest patch of Class 1 soil, the best there is...
Most of the Fed lands are in the mountains and desert. They own very little of the ag producing central vally.
the urban sprawl on top of that
lol. you should get /out more
I don’t care how much CA produces or what their contribution to GDP is - if the entire fucking state were to slide into the ocean it would be a fair bargain.

HOURLY REMINDER a southern retard drained Tulare Lake
Born in Penfield, Georgia, in 1882, J. G. Boswell was the son of Minnie Griffin and Joseph Osgood Boswell, both members of pioneer Georgia families.
Learning about development in California, he migrated there and settled in Pasadena. He bought property in Corcoran, located on Tulare Lake, which used to be the largest body of fresh water in the state. He worked to drain the wetlands around the lake, using dykes, ditches, canals, and dams in order to farm its fertile bed. He established his company in 1921 and started cultivating cotton in California. He was joined by his brother William Whittier Boswell. They managed the processing of the cotton and its marketing, and gradually acquired more property.
My only wish is to see the spirit of Sherman rise from the grave and finish the job once and for all.
but thats just it. They solved their water problems back then...it worked incredibly well.
sorry anon, the west is all mexicants and south americans now. Conditions have now become worse than east coast democrat run shitholes.
We're not dependent on California for survival, but yes, the price of specific produce would go up
You can live without it, honestly I hardly ever see Californian produce, it's all from Mexico or South America
Dairy won't ever be a problem, that is state narcissism on your part, we have the entire fucking Midwest and most states east of the rockies are excellent for agriculture and can support themselves
Most states east of the rockies don't even need the Midwest
There are farms fucking everywhere, it's just the Midwest has large scale agriculture, meat would probably be much more expensive without this abundance
There's also 180 million mouths to feed, smoothbrain.
Yeah let's pump metric fucktons of saltwater onto a plateau using God knows how much electricity and infrastructure so we can permanently fuck up the environment by literally salting the earth. Retard.
Australia has a massive solar power desalination plant that provides fresh water using electricity and seawater. A lot of the food we produce is wasted and ends up in landfills, because food merchants and supermarkets throw it in the garbage for profit reasons.
This but unironically. California is a waste of water.
Canadaugua is in NY
Just about every single fruit and vegetable you eat in the US comes from California when in season. The rest of the country just grow BS subsidized crops like corn and S 0 Y beans. If it wasn't for sunny California, all of you flyover fags would be eating nothing but onions all day with gallons of corn syrup to wash it down. California is basically just a massive industrial farm with a little bit of pretty around the edges. Flyover fags have no idea; they could not even begin to imagine fields filled with nuts and fruits and veggies instead of retarded ass corn and onions.
It is true that California produces a significant amount of agricultural products consumed in the US due to the multiple planting seasons due to sunny and warm weather year round. That said you ignore why the industrial midwestern farming infrastructure is built around basedbeans and corn, it's not like they just randomly picked crops by throwing darts at a board while blindfolded, you can Google it, its not like it's some big secret. Additionally it's a mutually beneficial trade in many ways, you talk about fruits vegetables, nuts, etc, for everything California produces it consumes plenty of pork, beef, and poultry which are significantly sourced from middle America and that corn/onions you shit talk goes to feed animals in basically the entire country, I suppose you could give up almost all affordable meat products except for maybe fish, in return we would have to restructure our vegetable markets and source stuff from Argentina or hydroponics/greenhouses/Southeastern states. In the end the loser would be the country as a whole, both California and flyover country would be made poorer by idiotic domestic policy. California produces the agricultural products/demand it can very efficiently and so too does middle America.
Just about every single fruit and vegetable you eat in the US comes from California when in season.
Lmao no. California has a near-monopoly on US production of a number of central valley crops as well as US wine production but there's a huge amount of all kinds of produce grown in many other places. I get my melons from fucking Colorado.
The rest of the country just grow BS subsidized crops like corn and S 0 Y beans.
First of all, California's agriculture is also subsidized to the gills. Second, California has a unique economic situation regarding agriculture largely thanks to its proximity to the pacific. If, on top of growing nuts for a domestic market you are also growing them to export to asia, then being within spitting distance of two of the world's busiest cargo ports makes much more sense than growing them in Missouri and then trucking them for 20 hours to get to Long Beach. Thirdly, the vast majority of american butchery products come from places that are not in fact California and equally as importantly, are raised on those fields of corn you snub.
If it wasn't for sunny California, all of you flyover fags would be eating nothing but onions all day with gallons of corn syrup to wash it down.
Lel. The main reason that so many things come from California is because it's cheaper to grow and process them there and not because other places around the US are incapable of growing them. There would certainly be a marked return to seasonality (which you are not immune to;the grapes I bought today were from Chile because winter exists in Cali as well) in a number of crops but if you think that all of a sudden nobody in the US is going to have melons or green onions or strawberries because they're not getting them from California then you're retarded.
Flyover fags have no idea; they could not even begin to imagine fields filled with nuts and fruits and veggies instead of retarded ass corn and onions.
And the literal millions of illegals working them.
And the almonds go to China
The almonds go to Israel. Jews fucking love nuts and they're always being fucking jews. They actually shut down their domestic Almond production and their neighboring country's as well because they didn't have enough water and they didn't want their upstream neighbors taking the water before it got to them. Now they rape California's water supply to feed their insatiable desire for nuts and nut products.
They also import a shit ton of pistachios from Iran of all places. It's technically illegal but these fucking jews claim that all other pistachios are inferior to Iranian pistachios, so they set up Turkish shell companies to act as a middleman / passthrough and get around the embargo (and also to get a better price)
I'll bet importing another 10million immigrants to California will help them conserve water.
Doesn't Florida have fruit? And you can buy locally grown vegetables
You can live without it, honestly I hardly ever see Californian produce
I live in the SE and just did a quick and random survey in my local produce dept. almost every fruit and vegetable I looked at was grown in CA. My guesstimate was 80% with the rest coming from Chile or MX. not scientific but its an indication.
for everything California produces it consumes plenty of pork, beef, and poultry
CA is 4th in beef production and 8th in chicken
Factually CA isn't even in the top ten (despite it's massive size and population) for either of those. It is number ten for poultry but produced 1/4 the poultry of Iowa, the highest producing state for poultry (and pork) despite Iowa being significantly smaller and less populated. To add these stats are generous, the USDA stats make California look like even more of a meat leech from middle America than these stats. That's fine, I'm happy for interstate commerce to be strong as it's good for the country but let's be honest and stop pretending like CA does all of the agricultural effort in the country.
Pork: https://www.statista.com/statistics/194371/top-10-us-states-by-number-of-hogs-and-pigs/
Beef: https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/beef-production-by-state
Poultry: https://www.statista.com/statistics/196085/top-us-states-by-number-of-chickens/
Lastly, even if your claims were factual, that cattle, poultry, and pork would be still majority fed by Midwestern field corn and S o y beans given how affordable they are on a per kcalorie basis.
stop pretending like CA does all of the agricultural effort in the country.
nobody said that. But lets not pretend that CA doesnt produce a very significant portion of US agriculture or that its just "almonds and wine"
I've never argued otherwise, I didn't make any arguments about wine and almonds, I don't care how CA uses it's water, that's your problem so you're barking up the wrong tree. I'm merely critiquing your retarded statement about how great and generous California is because it produces 
nuts and fruits and veggies
And the Midwest is assumably full of inbred dead weight morons because it produces
BS subsidized crops like corn and S 0 Y beans.
This is the reductive moronic opinion of Agriculture I'd expect from the average American (who is almost always a complete moron about virtually ever single topic surrounding agriculture and energy), you seem to be somewhat invested in the forum though so you're either a CA farmer, someone very interested in your own states farming infrastructure and techniques, or a troll (if thats the case here is your (you)) so you should know better but maybe my expectations from Californians are simply too high.
Btw that comparison is completely disingenuous for "feeding America". Let's not pretend that CA range free, gmo free fed, specialty beef that garners significantly higher cost per pound because people in high income states/cities are dumb enough to buy it to feel better about themselves is the same thing as mass abundant production of cattle in many interior states like TX and OK. Even still, despite being the third largest state and the most populous you can barely, by value, be number 7 in beef only and get mollywhoped by states with half the land isn't that impressive.
California and Texas love pretending that they could be independent countries because they have some agriculture, or energy production...lol. If they were independent, they'd immediately be reconquered by the US, probably on false pretenses, but it wouldn't matter in the end. And that's the best outcome they could hope for. They would have to build stronger unions with neighboring states if they really wanted to do that.
California's economy relies on entertainment, service, and information. This agriculture stuff is pure cope, it is vastly insufficient for the massive population.unless everyone starts eating nothing but cranberries and almonds lol.
By itself, Cali couldn't feed even one of its cities without significant imports, which wouldn't be too hard with all that coast, but the US gov would declare war on anyone who helped an independent California, or Texas. Not to mention, California's economic power would drop drastically without support from the rest of the US. Your state is one of the most powerful and well represented within the union, top 3 easy, and yet you faggots bitch because you want more. Big mystery why everyone thinks Californians are spoiled faggots
Let's not pretend that CA range free, gmo free fed, specialty beef that garners significantly higher cost
lets not pretend thats the majority of CA beef. The vast majority of CA beef production is from feed lots. Harris ranch being one of the biggest feedlots in the country
be number 7 in beef only and get mollywhoped by states with half the land isn't that impressive.
it is impressive given all the other AG products the state produces in addition to beef. Most people dont realize CA produces that much beef or dairy.
actually california is a major figure in exporting beef because uhhhhhh nobody realizes that california exports beef!
Okay retard
that MUCH
disingenous retort as cope cuz seething
ok retard.
Well Ca dominates the world in food and drink so frogs are off the hook.

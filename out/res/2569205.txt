Only people who have gone outside irl beyond a weekend warrior dayhike will understand pic rel
All the prepper consoomers from /pol/ and /k/ will be able to name the brands, but none of you faggots will be able to name the trees
go outside son.
N
Oh look, another ultralight thread
Larpers dont want you to know this but you can block freeze fresh meat and keep it from spoiling for a good 3 days in well insulated thermos container. 
You can pretty much take anything on an overnighter if youre not afraid of the weight/bulk.
huh?
birch killed me
I like to take tofu too
high protein, although a bit watery (only ~150kcal/100g) and thus relatively heavy
lol
LMAO
Bioavailability is under 70.
It’s crazy to me how these have exploded in popularity over the past ~5 years, considering this same design has been around for two decades. People who do go out understand the nuance of varying weather, while people who don’t simply theorycraft worst case scenarios (muh hard shell).
what are you talking about?
onions protein has an excellent amino acid composition and is one of the best absorbed proteins
and then not even talking about Gluconeogenesis
which is pretty slow for onions so your body can actually use the protein you eat instead of just making more carbohydrates out of it
or the fact that Bioavalibility is a highly criticized concept itself 
and there is currently more of a "is probably wrong" consensus in science (outside of your /fit/ness bro circles)
Pottery
Bait/10
This whole thread is bait and you're a faggot for bumping this thrad instead of saging like others have
Yeah, you’re one of the people who doesn’t understand. Not every rain shower is a downpour in January. Not every piece of land is perfectly shaded with a thick tree canopy. Or maybe you don’t know how popular they’ve become because you’re out of touch, which is fine.
Try again, in English this time.
kek
All of your other threads were saged off the board so there's that
I've only made one thread ever, so
Man the sodium levels in some of these foods lol
Have to keep the salt ready for when some anon posts about Savotta bags
Or the pages of torn up Osprey bags havesting refund refugees.
I remember when someone tried to pass off a torn Osprey bag as their own. It was a picture they found on Reddit from like 8 years ago with a broken YKK zipper.
The r/ buy it for life one? I remember that. I thought it was just a redditor with osprey, who posted about it because they had used it. 8 years is a long time so they probably only had the photo. I remember thinking "Huh so redditors do use them." Never interupt an idiot making a mistake I guess. Point proven.

I need to uo my food game, I went for my first hike where I slept outside last week and my food was a bit shit, so tell me what are the best options.
Ice cream back at camp is amazing
my idea:
--2 categories: main food, snacks
MAIN FOOD
-bread dough to cook
-butter (best for cold weather)
-canned meat
-canned condensed milk
-canned tuna
-canned tomatoes 
-canned fruit
-powdered coffee
-dry biscuits
-dried meat (expensive af)
-pemmican
-electrolytes to put in water 
SNACKS
-protein bars
-crackers (wasa, Ritz, tuc, normal crackers etc)
also cereal bars for snacks 
post infographics if you got them
Nice b8m8, how'd you know bitchmade isn't welcome here?
I just eat like summer sausage and cheese, maybe some triscuits.
Vienna Sausages are another staple, basically all sorts of bar shaped foods.
If I bring a little stove I'll also bring like a can of beanee weenees or some spam or something.
"Camping" foods like freeze dried stuff or MRE's are too expensive.
Take one of those and cook meat and potatoes 
this is one of my /out/s
oats, meat, coffee
all you need brother
do you like eating oat for real? 
I would rather make some sandwiches
I bring canned chicken, chicken broth, can of salsa verde, and cream cheese to make soup. Also, on the border tortilla chips.
dried beans
dried tuna
dried potatoes
dried onions
cup-a soup tomato or chanterelle
im currently drying 4.5kilo of red beans
i love oatmeal
how far /out/ are you where there's processed lumber to burn?
can't knock the hustle though i do this shit in my back yard too
jesus fuck anon
carrying all this shit with water in it and zero nutritional density
then bringing pemmican and dried meat and biscuits
what's the fucking point
either you're bringing camping food or glamping food. just pick one. either eat tasty shit if you're doing a short trip in the woods or actually read the nutrition label and learn what the things on it mean if you're spending extended time in the backcountry.
About 1 mile from the road, I have absolutely no clue how this shit got there ngl
Look at the canned foods aisle of your local supermarket and decide from there. I usually bring canned tuna, salmon and chicken, instant rice or noodles (something I can cook fully with less than ideal fire on a camping pot), maybe canned chickpeas or legumes, and canned vegetables. I also bring fresh fruit, I don't bother with fresh vegetables unless I'm in a very short (sub 3 days) expedition. I usually bring my air rifle while /out/ so I can compliment my food with doves and quails I find. For snacks I to bring like nuts, dried bananas, some chocolate candy, and crackers, but usually I'm not snacking much while out, exercising cuts my appetite.
Bland food is very delicious once you switch into hobo mode.

To some of the retards on this board, eating anything but unhealthy goyslop means you're a larping faggot with zero outdoor experience
Anon, this question is too open ended. What are your goals? How far are you hiking? How long are you staying? 
If your focus is on camping, you have more options. Weight is less of an issue. Short trips allow for food that would otherwise spoil. Longer hikes are tougher, as weight can be a determination factor of comfort. If your focus is on hiking, canned food isn’t a good option.
You can thank me later.
Not my problem.
Coffee
nomnom
hiking, id stay out 1 night and 2 days, or 2 nights and 3 days, that the most I can do since I do it in the weekend, I want to bring stuff to keep me fed and not be miserable, and possibly that tastes well, and isnt a pain in the dick to cook, last time I had rice which is annoying to cook since it uses water, and tuna cans, which I don't really like, and cereal bars, indid eat the first night because I was cold as fuck and tired so I went to sleep, btw incoukdnt feel my toes anymore, after I changed my socks wet It was much better, idk the temp but probably was below 0 because my tarp had small ice things above my sleeping bag hole where I was breathing.
anyway the next day my muscles went into exhaustion much faster (idk if that's the true reason but it's what i noticed) bc I didn't eat, plus having shit food lowers morale and makes the experience less pleasant
my rice tasted like plastic because I had to use my bladder water to cook it, and it had fucking pine needles inside
what do you use to protect the trangia from wind? it was a pain on the dick to use because there was alot of wind, plus if you dont have even ground it leaks all over, and i have difficulties trying to put stuff on top of It dance indoor have any pedestal
If I saw somebody do this I'd simply beat them to death or shoot them. Ain't no way I'm letting this retard live.
hope we meet while hiking then
Look here: >>2564818
It's a cheap aluminium windshield that i reduced to 5 segments and shortened. I then used thin tent stakes as holders for the pot, that way it all holds together.
I made better pics a few years ago, need to find them.
So do I, but since there's already a line to beat your ass you'll die wondering.
Another oversocialized moralfaggin sjw escaped from the city. Get him boys.
Yes.
This should explain it all.
cool setup thanks, what do I search for to find the shield?
aluminum windshield I guess
I'd beat you unconscious if you ever did this within eyeshot of me. You people are worse than niggers
Yeah french RCIR are always a good bet
just look up alcohol stove on aliexpress, you can get a screen and stove for under $10
camping aluminium windshield on Aliexpress, Ebay or Amazon. You need 5 segments at least.
The tent stakes came with a cheap Aldi tent i think.
I like you, you are ok.
You won't do shit except cry about it on 4cucks like you are now
thanks i bought this one on Aliexpress, paid 10 euros
yes there were 2 aluminum ones for 40 cents bit they shipped in 2 months
they always give ridiculous shipping dates on aliexpress, most shit arrives in 2-3 weeks
If it can be avoided, don’t bother cooking with your filtered water. Just use water directly from a stream or creek, if possibly. It’s going to be booked anyway.
I’ve got two homemade meals that are my go to favorites. Neither requires any kind of actual cooking or dehydrating. 
The first is Slurkas beans and rice. It’s super popular, delicious, calorie dense, and nutritionally balanced. It’s instant refried beans, minute rice, taco seasoning, cheese, and Fritos. Google it. Trust me Anon, it’s well worth it.
The second is a simple combination of dry chorizo sausage, minute rice, a bouillon cube, and Italian seasoning. I use 2oz of sausage, 1 cup of rice, 1 small bouillon cube, and 1/4tsp of Italian seasoning. 
Minute rice is an ok option when you can measure everything at home. Just about anything you need to heat up will require water, or will be pretty heavy (which is an issue since your focus is on hiking). Rice dishes use a little less than soups, but are generally less forgiving if you get the water amount wrong (Skurka’s beans and rice is an exception).
oh ok thanks, it's the first time I buy from there, anyway I would've bought this one regardless because I like the color
Just use water directly from a stream or creek
yes if I boil it, but I should pre filter otherwise I get shit inside my food
jesus fucking christ dude are you trying to start a wildfire?
Holy fuck never go outside again retard
What is it to you? Do you think wild fires start itself?
Holy shit, you don't even think, do you.
Perfect.
That is why i usually just buy the same shit but shipped by Amazon, it's faster and sometimes even cheaper. I don't mind if it#s 10% or so pricier either.
noo you can't light a fire near a tree 
noo you cant light a fire near fucking needles 
nothing happened
I thought those were a package of sprinkles, then I asked myself why I'm not bringing a package of sugary colorful cornstarch with me every hike
Oatmeal masterRace
I take the oatmeal with dinosaur eggs in it
:3
Are you trying to kill that fucking tree?? Jesus Christ i hate you washitington and califaggots
You won't do shit except cry about it on 4cucks like you are now
Don't play tough on the interwebs, just learn from your mistake.
right
E luuul imagine just not spill 99 euro for the definitely better jetboil system poor gonna be poor i guess
This man has a stroke.
100g Cashew Nuts
hobo
at least try, faggot, no hobo eats that expensive as fuck stuff
I'm not the one making threats on an anonymous internet forum
Is there an outdoor manual for stuff like this?
Im not the guys who threatened you. I made my fair share of mistakes, really bad ones, too.
Admitting making a mistake simply makes the world a better place.
Erbstwurst. It ain't pretty but it tastes nice and lasts long.
A new stable I just discovered: Chinese chili oil. I had used it at home for long time but now I take it with me whenever I go camping. It just makes everything so much bettwr
Some sources will have more sediment than others. You can either use a bandana to filter out sediment or just be careful and deal with a tiny amount of dirt.
Its never a good idea to set fire to tree roots.
Gelatin powder Is great stuff. 70% protein, high in BCAA and its collagen so the knees like it.
I also bring a KG of Cheese with me into the bush, and just put it on everything. Its fucking good.
kg of cheese
Europe was a mistake
Man, oats with some peanuts and candied fruit, or even raisins... *chef kissing his fingertips*
Too bulky, too heavy and too much packaging.
But 10€ for 3600kcal, what a deal.
Tortellini plus Opinel, t'es cramé le bleu.
What’s the goyslop he’s asking them to eat? What’s even the point of this post other than to seethe about a mental argument you’re having with yourself?
The good news is that on shorter trips you can be very flexible as you're not trying to cram a weeks worth of food into your bag. Worry a little less about weight of the food and focus on dietary needs, quality, and ease of cooking.
For long, moderate activity like hiking I tend to lean towards focus on quick and easy complex carbs with a little fat and protein. I have a water tight cooking set up so I will often do cold soak oatmeal for the morning with milk powder or granola and peanut butter. I don't want to heat up anything more than a few oz of water for coffee and get moving faster. During the day I try to avoid an extended lunch break, hiking with a full stomach just makes my afternoon hike slower so bars, fruit snacks, etc. during the day about every 2hrs. Sometimes a tortilla with something (usually the same meat for dinner) if I'm actually stopping.
Dinner is the big one. If you use rice, get the 5min stuff. Instant mash potatoes, pasta sides, etc are popular because they are cheap, flavorful, and cook fast. They are easy to dress up by adding dry spices, a little hot sauce bottle/packets, etc. I will often bring a bag of dry veggies to toss in and sausage of some kind. I also don't cook by boiling in my cook pot, canister stoves kinda suck for that. I have a separate, sealable cook pot that has a reflectix coozie. Boil the water, pour over the rice, stir, seal, wait 10-15min. Saves me fuel and I just busy myself with something else while waiting. Due to duration of your hikes, you can absolutely get away with canned stuff, just make it cans you like. I like fish in a good sauce to go over the rice, or flavored meat spreads. Experiment at home too. Don't neglect a little desert either, candy bars and hot chocolate mix are good morale boosters.
Also unless temps make it a challenge, don't be afraid to eat fresh. Fruit, hard bread, bagels, cheese, pickles. In cooler weather cream cheese, deli meats, go nuts. On longer hikes I used to get a sandwich and leave off the dressings, then just pick up a couple of the packets of mustard, relish, and mayo. Always consider pack space and weight needs first but especially on a weekender don't be afraid to ball out every once and a while. Even on thru hike stuff you still take the opportunity to eat good and different when you can, no reason to make it suck if it doesn't have to.
What? I don't speak baguette.
Find some morels, wild garlic and nettles, congratulation you now have yourself a delicious meal. 
Works well enough if you're familiar with the area you're camping/hiking in, at least for finding morels, nettles and wild garlic aren't difficult to find.
If I see you in the process of causing a root fire, I'm shoving my trekking pole so far up your ass... I don't know where to take this metaphor from here, but I'll shove it up there real good, so here's a poem to make up for the metaphor: roses are red, violets are blue, I'll use my trekking pole to sodomize you. Oh I know, I'll shove both of them up there so far you can hear them clicking together when you talk.
Rose's are red, violets are blue, come at me and I'll fucking shoot you. I'll shoot your faggot dog if you have one as well.
Ah, it's you. What a surprise the faggot who masturbates to the thought of shooting dogs also fantasizes about starting wildfires.
I wish rice wasn't such a bitch to wash desu. They're pretty neat
Not that anon, just anon who has no issue with shooting you. Again, come at me faggot.
Don't worry, if I see you setting a brushfire, you won't see me coming before it's too late.
I recommend getting this self suffiecent backyard book. One of the best hard copies I could find. It goes over everything from water collection, a few important medicinal plants, on site electrical generation, food cultivation and preservation etc

https://www.trail.recipes/backpacking-recipes/
these look yummy
Just do it before going out desu. You're out there to have a good time, not wash rice.
Is that you handkerchief German?!
good grief. how can you be into going outdoors but also do something like this?
Veg was for hobo packet chicken. But we've all done that to death at a campground. First time making "Cheddar Bay" biscuits with coals before tho.
Split the site with my parents, they have a TT. Three freeze warnings fulfilled since Saturday, and me and my three small kids were at the limit of the gear we have for them.
Reflectix, pads, air mattresses, unfortunately only 30F bags. Called it.
No reason to slog them thru the rest of the reservation. Besides, got cousins and nephews and nieces that handily filled the site to capacity after we left.
Proud the little tykes stuck it out, even tho it became a game of killing time until the next got morsel, cocoa, or meal hahaha.
Hot morsel, not got. Also, before asked: don't have photos of all meals. Shared what I happened to take pics of, despite 3 squares a day besides snacks. Would say don't have social media, but I use this site, so that's not true.
Oatmeal with cinnamon &amp; coriander is all I need
Yes, an older iteration without handkerchief.
All bushcrafty with the Stongarm but forgot to bring one of the most essential bushcraft tools: a fork
catch &amp; cook is the way lad
French pasta
German nuts
American jerky
international coffee
You. I like you.
Behold my garden.
Cheers.
I'm a man of international supply chains.
:-)
That's it bro. Can even run a line while you do other stuff. Can bring some veggies for vitamins and perhaps some carbs. Tortillas for fish tacos are not a bad idea. Dry milk powder is good for cereal. Of course if you can track, trap/shoot, and butcher your own game, you can eat like a king while camping. Securing meat and water means securing your indefinite survival, being a very energy dense food that can be cooked to be even more nutritious.
Fish trapping and survival fishing is a great way to passively secure food from the wilderness while focused on other tasks like setting up shelter and a fire. When you reach a point that your basic needs are secured, you are really left to your own devices. To write or prepare for a hunt, to play music from an instrument or distill traditional corn wash moonshine, to tend to your guerilla crops or to make sweaty love with a woman bent over against a tree. You know, normal camping activities.
Never tried fish trapping but tried to fish with a fly fishing rod, can't say i have ever gotten a bite. How do i know what bait to use depending on species? We have perch and pike here depending on the time of the year
You have a lot of options for fish trapping, you can just set a line and a hook with bait really to passively catch individual fish, or use a slat or basket trap that can be bought or made from local materials. Here is a basic trotline, it's just multiple fishing lines on one line, so you can haul in multiple fish overnight or even quicker.
We have perch down here, worms are good bait you can find locally, minnows, whatever you would usually use. I think the word trotline comes from trout line, so it's not limited to catfish or any one type of fish. If you can find a stream with fish, like you would do fly fishing in, you can use basket traps or even catch one in the palm of your hand with some bait in your palm against the water. Of course you can make a fishing spear as well, and you can spit roast the fish over a fire or process and grill the fillets.
My bad, here's the diagram.
You just need a means for the line to float, you may not need a weight. Empty jugs or shorelines are good for this, just clean up everything after you are done.
I wanna make a fish trap at some point. Too bad it's really illegal where I'm at.
You can use aluminum foil, kept inside the inner rim of your pot,.folded in half. You can form it into a wind screen to protect your fire
I wanna make a fish trap at some point. Too bad it's really illegal where I'm at.
Same here. But i did it anyway, got 12 fish, managed to get two out and just left the rest.
Sweet setup
If I saw some faggot doing this in the woods here in califaggot land I'd beat his ass. This is how you start a forest fire. How do you go out into the woods for the first time and NOT look up how to properly do it?

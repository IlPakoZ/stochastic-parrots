Any land surveyors? Hey buds, what's been your favorite job site so far?
Did Native Americans play Super Nintendo?
It's a shotgun barrel someone used as a property corner.
Here's a barrel of a break-action shotgun used as a corner. found a few myself but all of my surveying pics got wiped when my phone broke
holy shit that is badass as fuck
Back in the day before you could just go to the store and get rebar or pipe surveyors had to go to scrap yards and pretty much find whatever. A lot of really old corners will truly just be random shit.
My dad hired surveyors to survey the property lines once and for all and our neighbors got the shits and hired their own surveyors and my dad's surveyors gave us more land and their surveyors took it back
the fuck racket are you guys running exactly? do you guys go to surveyor bars at night and divvy up profits or some shit?
you get what you pay for sometimes
but my neighbors are poor and racial minorities this isn't fair :&lt;
boundary disputes ultimately come down to a contest of who can be the biggest cocksucking asshole. most of the time they are resolved in court. we just do the job and keep their heads down. i've seen lengthy legal battles over a few inches or feet just because one homeowner was pulling out pins or stakes and fucking up the entire survey.
ugh I know, my friend had that issue where his neighbor pulled up stakes and moved a stone wall, and had surveyors come and they just scratched their balls and charged him $500 to use their bathroom for the afternoon.
in my dad's case it was more to do with long stretches of land and the neighbor felling trees that were on our side of the original iron stakes. the surveyors maintained the original property lines, and their surveyors contested it. it was such a fucking scam you could smell matzo in the wind
RECONQUISTA LA RAZA
Two surveyor crews will typically come together and explain their discoveries to see if the line can be accurately determined. Your neighbor could have hired a cheap crew which won't necessarily result in a quality job, especially if done by an engineer. Some surveyors just suck and are lazy as fuck, some don't pick up on certain issues. Sometimes the surveyors have both done their jobs correctly and simply cannot come to an agreement, so then it's typically settled between the neighbors whether arbitration, lot line adjustment, mediation or court so it can get messy.
There are numerous factors and opinions involved that no one will likely ever result in the same solution. It usually boils down to intent and doing due diligence, or doing a quick haphazard performance or just outright deceiving the client. No one in the field really sets out to make mistakes such as that, they just work off of the information that is available to them. Most always search for the intent of the initial surveyor, usually supplied through the fieldwork. I could be 10â€™ off but if my field work shows due diligence in my performance a court of law will accept that. Surveyors don't typically know every single detail so then it comes back down to the owners settling it between themselves in a civil manner.
what are you saying
It blows my mind that survey isn't 100% GPS in modern day. 
They use GPS and compare it to historic line of sight and they almost never match for old properties. I can't imagine how much worse it is in Europe.
He's saying that ordinary people are retarded and that boundary disputes depend upon capricious and arbitrary factors, just like everything else in life.
The best thing you can do is be respectful, amicable and do your best to settle these disputed without getting the legal system involved.
capricious and arbitrary factors
Weird way to spell layers 
No, the best thing you can do is make sure they never ever find the bodies.
We're slowly getting there, then again you have a lot of cheap survey companies who's crews still use equipment several decades old because the new stuff is expensive, so they still have to set up on jobs because they're still using RTK. You have the older guys, many of who refuse to accept that GNSS equipment is becoming as accurate as their robots. Within the next 10 years between gps and drones I see most surveyors doing less field work than ever and becoming data processors. 
Layers?
Lawyer,
My bad, I was never good at spelling Hebrew words.
neighbor seemingly logged 80' - 100' over my line but no survey at our place
typical. you can't fix it unless you spend $500, probably to the exact same company who is responsible for the insult in the first place
Lmao the property i just bought was recently surveyed and subdivided for the sale and they left out a sliver of land right in the middle of what is now my property
Fortunately no one involved is an unreasonable asshole so it was easy to rectify but it seems like such a retarded mistake

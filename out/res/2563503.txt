post cool shots you've got recently
you'll probably have to convert to gif or webm, and severely compress to be able to post though
Piggy backing this thread.
I'm thinking about getting a gopro, and have some questions about their functionality. Do they take quality pictures? How long would a battery last if not being used for video? Are they feasible for 2 week stretches without access to the grid?
I just bought a GoPro Hero 10 and the battery drains pretty fast, even if it's just turned on, but at the same time if you're just taking landscape photos you don't need to walk around with the camera on.. I think you'll want an extra battery or two for a 2-week trip though. I'm brand new to video and photo so I can't speak for quality of photos
Don't expect the GoPro to be anything more then an action camera. 
Newer ones are better about photos. God even my 8 takes trashy photos...but the newer ones and including my 8. Over heat way to much.. my shit will just shut down from heat just from sitting in traffic for 5 minutes in Florida... I arguably have the worst one..(can't change the lense out) but have used it for 3 years now.. same four batteries. And high quality 32gb memory stick. 
If you have the top 2 smart phones. Your phone probably takes better photos- and possibly better tripod video than a GoPro.
There's like no good bridge filled for point and shoot style rugged cameras that shoot a high quality photo/video. And most manufacturers have abandoned the point and shoot market. Because they got out paced by smartphones. 
If anyone knows a good rugged DSLR/mirrorless that can survive a ton of vibrations and bouncing around I'm all ears.... (Real vibrations too, not just being in a pack) 
This thread is stupid. I cannot get a 15 second video compressed down enough to meet the 4 MB requirements of webmS.......
I need to get a new one. 
My old Contour kicked the bucket a few years ago, never replaced it. I loved the design of it, low profile and dead simple to use, but parts/accessories are impossible to find now. Hate how blocky/teletubby the gopros are.
I have a 10 Black
One pic I took with it says 23mp, 5568 x 4176, 11mb for whatever that's worth
Way better than my phone, probably not as good as dslr
Battery goes down 1-2% just by turning it on, taking pic, and shutting off
You can also mess with settings to get more/less quality/battery life
Batteries and power banks are pretty cheap too if you're serious about it
make sure to turn off the wifi in the settings which stays on by default, but even then that shit drains incredibly fast
Just share via gopro link

bump
I mean each to their own. dunno why anyone finds this shit attractive.. u know they look like two old ass pillows sewed by the edge and taped to a wall...
Like I enjoy some nice grooly photos every now and again, and 80% of the shit on the internet is some big ass girls with their pussys lookin' creamy because their thighs encase them and never let them actually dry out, and you know that shit smells like a wet opossum and a two day old bandaid.
I'm sorry that you got so upset
Just ordered a gopro hero 8 black a few days ago, can pick up the package in a few days, very excited
Keep writing man, don't leave me hanging like that.

Literally the only knife that you can use openly without scaring the normies. Everything else is concidered as a threat. Military style "tactical knives" are the biggest red flag and people will avoid you at all cost.
so i should carry around a military style assault knife then?
not true
a smaller scandi grind without tacticool styling is perfectly acceptable
in my experience people think its a fishermans knife and they’re right, i am fishing
It's true. Ever try to get through TSA with a k-bar on your belt? Fuckers put me on the no-fly list.
I hate euros so much bros...
where the fuck do you live? the UK? never met anyone scared of a tactical looking knife in my life. I think you just don't go outside and talk to people
Nah, your greasy hair and face + potent body odor get the job done, Mr. Too Edgy for Interpersonal Relationships.
You’re going to have a bad time here taking every shit post at face value anon.
Good
Knives are peak larp. Aside from the kitchen, there is really no need for even a swiss army knife. A small pair of scissors is much more useful for backpacking.
Decent bait
Nice one
I get away with the tiny Candiru without scaring the normies. The whole thing goes in the palm of my man hands.
What are you doing with your knife that you're scaring normies?
If you work in customer service or some shit, like you need to open a box for a customer, a good chunk of older women take a step back if you flip open a 3”+ tacticool folder.
simple pocket sand will break it
It looks like you took a wrong turn on your way to reddit.
They know you can handle 3 inches but not if its steel
Ranger > Fieldbastard
I just got that one. When you try to oil the hinges to make it smooth and a little pocket sand works its way in there and it feels like death every time you open the knife.
No it won't.
Genuine question, how would you get the paracord off of the top middle knife? Would you cut it somewhere or unwind it from the knot at the top? Does it make it more comfortable to hold? How many feet is it?
Nta but the paracord isn't meant to come off. If you really to, you can cut it and unravel it.
opinel are alright, looks like a peasant/work knife
I have a small ultrasonic washer so its not a big deal to deep clean these things when needed.
Good
literally only thanks to the scissors
How do you clean those fuckers?
Rubbing Alcohol and Q-tips?
Here's mine.
Untie it, cut it, you can see where the ends are burnt and I’m sure you could pop it through with a stick or something and unravel it if you wanted.
Hot soapy water flush, compressed air blast, rinse, dry, and oil.
Anyone else use a neck knife on /out/ shit?
do eurotrash really?
The depth of retardation expressed by obedient, passive serfs is inexplicable. Imagine giving up self defensive items because some Karen is scared of them....bitch, that's the point.
There is no such thing as a neck knife. Whatever marketing retard that came up with that needs to be sterilized. I have a small fixed blade that I pocket Carey because having a knife dangling around your neck is retard and unnecessary...and unsafe in most industries.
imagine protesting to have a constitutional right taken away from you.
holy shit progs really ARE cattle.
Bruh I don't know where he lives either, I don't think anyone would care in most places in europe.
You have teeth anon, you dont need a knife or scissors for any of that.
Cute knife
I remember when I was 12 and thought these were cool. This is the Short Circuit of knives.
Just because 1983 was a long time ago doesn't mean the knives are bad now

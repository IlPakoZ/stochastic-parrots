My therapist told me to go outside. What is there to do outside? I havent been out all winter and my physical condition is shit. I have gone on walks couple of times in forests but it is not enjoyable
Go fishing.
not him, but i've wanted to learn to fish but none of my friends know how.
how can i learn to fish? should i just pay some boomer 50 bucks to take me along on a fishing trip and show me the basics?
Actually good idea. Pro tips for starting?
Not OP but I just can’t get into fishing, is it just zoomer brain? I love hunting and camping but get so fucking bored fishing
Read the guides on the Fishing &amp; Tackle thread >>2572120 → as a decent starting point. Don't take that as gospel however, rather use it as a springboard to start doing your own research. Don't be afraid to ask questions in that thread or ask people at local sporting goods stores.
The point of fishing isn't to try and maximize your efficiency at catching fish, its a passive activity. It sounds like you definitely have zoomerbrain.
Keep walking-it reduces anxiety and stress levels
Your doctor is right, but in order to actually enjoy the outdoors you first need to break all your other dopamine addictions, such as vidya, tv, social media, and porn. You need to reset your attention span.
Get an ebike and you can go good distances for less effort, quicker than walking, good enough exercise, is enjoyable.
Thanks, I will look into that thread
Dunno about that, it's what everybody says and I'm going to continue, but it just never really worked for me that way. I also got flatfeet so walking becomes almost unbearably painful after a while, I even got over pronation countering shoes but they don't really seem to work. I've done some cycling before which is better for me than walking, but still don't really get any good feelings from it either. Heard about runners high but never experienced anything like it. I guess my brain receptors are burnt to shit with living unhealthy lifestyle. And even though I realize it's good for my health, it's incredibly hard to keep any motivation up when there's no positive feelings connected to it.
Very much true. I'd really need a total change in my lifestyle, because my whole life currently consists of things you mentioned
I've been actually wanting to, just currently too expensive purchase for me
Of course its a catfaggot

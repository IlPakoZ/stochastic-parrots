i fucking love the night sky
I love you made a thread instead of posting your shit facebook status - on ya know, facebook.
Has any anon ever tried a hike using the stars instead of a compass?
Same anon. Night sky is best sky.
I'm not competent enough to do this
No, I'm retarded.
i mean it's better than just picking a random direction but the best you can get with celestial (and no equipment) is like +-45 degrees from where you think you're heading. this assumes you have knowledge to actually pick out certain stars, know where they stars are in the sky at all times of the night, and have a clear view of the sky the entire time. even sailing which is the one place i've successfully used the stars/sun those are just a reference point and you are still primarily relying on the compass. 
the lost art of finding our way is a good book on the history of navigation and goes over some of the different ways people used stars but it definitely drives home how vague most forms of navigation are.
I do too but it also fills me with existential dread
It's Sunday night
Good job, grandma.
You can easily find north to within 1 degree. How hard is it to judge other angles from that?
I hope you're mentally prepared for SpaceX space billboards.
meme related, but t-bh I know what you mean
This kind of content is going to get shoved down your fuckin' throat until you like it.

For me, it's the Pleiades.
I hate watching them crawl across the sky like ticks
Pleiadeeeeeez nuts
Why did (((god))) make me so ugly? Doesn't seem to serve any purpose besides suffering and loneliness.
fucken retard
Pardon the blurriness of the pic, my nikon didn't have a remote at the time so the long exposure shots get a little fiddly

We have about 4 billion years to get off this rock. If we fail, we deserve irrelevance.

(((Elons))) robots are coming for you, the rope is the only escape you have.
nice
He makes the most vapid creatures on earth (women) beautiful and men looking like lotr ogres. Don't remember exactly what those were called though. Yet even then he is only truly sought after by those same men he made ugly and gave horrible lives
Sorta looks like a Black Panther fist
It sickens me bros
Here's a picture I took of orion's neb
My backyard is bortle 4 but I have bortle 1 30 mins in any direction.
Not an argument
Btw which god are we talking about? Humans have come up with quite a few.
Sometimes the moon is so bright I can't see properly the sky 
but Sometimes the sky is just on point and you can even see the nebulas and new stars

good site to see the light pollution and help decide where to stargaze
https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/
shame most of the world is light polluted
What child doesn't know this? This is like the first thing anyone in the northern hemisphere learns about the night sky.
Ea
Yeah I do it but I'm an amateur astronomer. If you can recognize the big dipper you're good. If you know where Scorpio (summer) or Orion (winter) is, that's generally in the southern sky
Same
Was backpacking up nort a couple of weekends ago. Ate some THC gummies and leaned back against a rock at night. Tripped on the Milky Way and the unfathomable smallness of my existence until I couldn't stand it any more and hide to hide my eyes.
no no, dont avoid it. walk forward into it like a kid fascinated by her first encounter with fire. you were this close to learning something. the burn is temporary
Dude, you were missing one thing that would have blown you away: A hammock.
If you wanted maximum existential crisis, you should bring a pair of binoculars and look at the Milky Way. You will trip balls and realize you're smaller than you ever imagined when you see what's in our galaxy that your eye can't see

How bright are auroras compared to the surrounding stars? Compared to light polluted skies?
Through naked eye you want to sit there and let your eyes adjust. Don't fuck around with your camera constantly like a typical aurora nerd. Then the beams can get pretty bright and the depth the show up in the stratosphere is spectacular, makes you feel very small.
I mean thermosphere/exosphere, fuck.
Here's a shitty picture of the Andromeda galaxy I took a few months ago through my telescope.
Another equally bad picture of Bode's galaxy. For anyone wondering what a galaxy looks like in person, they are very faint grey smudges. The colorful pictures you see on the internet are the result of long exposures and a bit of photo editing to bring out the colors.
You obviously don't go out with friends. Nobody knows this unless I tell them
Here's my picture of M81 that I took with my phone through the eyepiece. I was using an equatorial mount.

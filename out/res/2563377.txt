What states have you visited? Layovers don’t count. 
https://www.amcharts.com/visited_states
Ill participate in your datamining thread. Most of this was for hiking or family. Except Florida, going there was a mistake.
WA
CA
not oregon
thank you, a rare based Californian. =P
What was your favorite east coast hiking state? I’ve always wanted to check out Maine. New Hampshire was my favorite with Virginia/West Virginia tied for second. 
I’m actually going to Oregon for the first time ever this year but it’s for a wedding so I don’t think I’ll be able to do any backpacking unfortunately. Hoping I can still do some day hikes though.
Vermont because its way more isolated than most people think. The hiking culture there is top notch, the weather is brutal and also enchanting, and the lack of actual overlooks and views keeps a lot of normies away as long as you are not on the AT. Western Maine is a close second but I hate coastal Maine and the County.
Not impressed with the west
Except Florida, going there was a mistake.
Let your family know too. We're full of Yankee shit already..
Where’d you go? Arizona and Washington have some of my favorite National Forests. Utah is also amazing IMO as long as you avoid the crowds but Zion NP has unfortunately been ruined by the throngs of retards carving their names on the arches and throwing their trash on the trails.
Zion wasn't even that cool... Also people never tell you to go to Utah during spring (you should if you enjoy the color green) 
Spring advice goes for any high desert states too...
I will say that when I went backpacking in Arizona it was in spring and the weather was immaculate plus the crowds were pretty small. I generally prefer National Forests to Parks because they’re free, no camping permit required, little to no “developed” campsites which keeps the obnoxious car campers away and they’re usually bigger than National Parks.
I went from Vegas to the Grand Canyon with a stop at Hoover Dam. California was the Pacific Ocean and a hike to the Hollywood Sign. The only redeemable part was the coast. The rest of the west is very blah to me. Utah looks interesting but I can see canyons and natural arches in the Red without flying all the way across the country.
do states i drove through on road trips count or nah?
p much the whitest area left in the country too
I've been to all of them except North Dakota and Alaska. I've been /out/ in maybe a third though.
Planning on crossing the border soon bros. Wish me luck. Don't worry I won't stay. I'll be taking the CDT into Canada.
I want to go to alaska sometime soon
I have never left, and I have no desire to leave.

Here's the /out/ version
I just kind of drove through the middle parts and the northeast. Rectifying that soon.
very based
Planning on going to Vermont this summer. Exciting I know.
Based southern anon
Same. It’s been a dream of mine since I was 10. Hoping to go to Alaska within the next 3-5 years.
Vermont rules, take advantage of the cheese fridge
I've got to do more W of the Mississippi
How have none of you been to Alaska?
i ain't flyin commercial and i'll be damned before i go drivin through syrup nigger country
Sales?
naw just family spread out north and west from me
lived in southwest for some years and visit family up in the midwest occasionally
Arizona only. Not from the USA either. Think the only other state I want to visit is Utah honestly, to see Zion
Not american but I need to see the North West, seen enough desert shit but that is where work takes me
here's the /out/ version
hiking and "overnighting" are the only activities
That's fine, and the mountains might not do much for you if you're from a mountainous area yourself. I recommend Washington state, though. Specifically the olympic peninsula
WAY DOWN SOUTH IN THE LAND OF COTTON
OLD TIMES THERE ARE NOT FORGOTTEN
LOOK AWAY

DIXIELAND
Olympic penn certainly is the most bang for ypur buck in washington.
Its not
you're a lying piece of shit
Delete this
also: fuckoff were full

Why do faggots like this come to a perfectly good /out/ related thread and try to derail it by throwing an autistic fit? How has the discussion in this thread not been /out/ related?
In terms of cost of living?
I'd have thought AK would have been on more people's /out/ bucket lists
Did you fly into Canada to go to... Alaska?
It’s definitely on my bucket list but I live on the east coast so just getting there is pretty expensive and time consuming
Been invited for the last 6 or so years. 
The logistics of getting a trailer full of snowmobiles there is the challenge.
pic kinda related
That's probably the Tri-Cities, but that's mostly because it sucks ass and not many are willing to live there.
That's convenient because the rest of the country wants your fat, dumb ass to stay there too.
Texas soon
Would like to go to upstate NY, and then back to Washington, Tennessee, and North Carolina. I don't think I'm really antsy to visit any more states besides Idaho, Montana, and Vermont during the fall.
Would like to go to upstate NY
You're welcome to come as long as you don't go during late-September thru October because we're unironically full then. Stay the fuck out then, k?
Because not everyone is a fatfuck amerilard
26 years old this thing should include Puerto Rico and the virgin Islands too
All of them, and about four dozen foreign countries.
Only counting states where I've left the airport, layovers definitely don't count.
I travel for work, previously to places mostly in major cities, but now more to flyover country.
Technically I've been to every state except Alaska and Hawaii. These are the ones that I have memories of that don't involve bus/train layovers or driving through. 
Minnesota and Wisconsin are next. Lake Superior is the only Great Lake that I haven't visited and that will be changing soon.
Im a wisconsinite
The only state I´ve ever been in is depression.
Except Florida, going there was a mistake.
Absolutely based. Only been there once, absolutely hated it.
Victoria, new south wales, queensland

stop anon. your trust fund is showing.
America is an wild, exotic country
t. Canadian dourist :DD
Canadian roadtripper. I'd say the southwest is the best >>2563416 When to CO/UT/AK in may/june last year and it was better than sept/oct just for the green and wildlife. Skipped Zion this time since half the park was closed and had a reservation list. Pleasant surprises at Great Bassin and Dinosaur NP. I confirm that National forest/grassland in these states are as much fun if you're prepared. Some nice spots in SC/NC as well.
Rare north Dakota and alaska
So many people love that place. What did you not like about it? Are you a cold weather guy
went to the biggest shithole states in the US 
why
If you wanted to go to all the places with the largest populations you shouldve went to NYC too
Ive visited all the ones that are worth visiting...excluding Oregon, Washington, ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. We should exterminate every one from there and living there.
Fuck, forgot pic
Kinda weird that I haven't bothered to visit new Mexico. But I've been to old Mexico quite a bit. I've also been to most EU nations
Kek
Also people never tell you to go to Utah during spring
That's because you retards don't understand flash floods, and it takes forever to find your bodies
midwestern lumpenprole
who doesn't think vermont is isolated?
mimaled.com
Virginias no more.
I want to see the midwest.
You've already seen the good part of it (Great Lakes)
fuck the eastern seaboard
He didn't go to Alabama, Mississippi or Louisiana
good thread
;_;
pain and suffering
I've left my 20 square mile home area only a handful of times in my life
At least you live in a scenic part of the country. Imagine living in flyover country and never traveling. Now that would be a shit life.
nah im in southern Idaho/northern nevada area. Nothing scenic here haha. Closeby though yeah
I travel by motorcycle and avoid the midwest like the plague
black hills and glass mountains in oklahoma are a fun ride, just my personal experience. only midwest state worth a stop.

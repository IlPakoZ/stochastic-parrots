Just did a 2 mile beach run on the first super nice day of the year.
Decided to go shirtless for the first time since I've been losing weight.
Still husky, but my scale is heading in the right direction.
Got no less than a dozen looks from women of all ages and colors as I ran past.
The love for the fit dadbod is alive and well

Be me
Fit young woman going on a stroll at the beach with my friends
See something splashing in the distance
Is that a beached whale?
It can't be it looks like it's coming right at us
It's a middle aged 300 pound neck beard running shirtless
Look at my friend in disgust but she can't stop staring at this lovecraftian horror barreling towards us
Look back at disgusting incel
He winks at us
As soon as he passes me and Stacy burst out laughing
Good job losing weight, but I'm pretty sure they were just looking because you were running. People look at me all the time, and I just assume it's because they're not used to seeing people running.

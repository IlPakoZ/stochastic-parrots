Hello fellow Sierra Chad.
First thing that comes to mind is how to effectively slaughter and bleed them and that I want more tools in my toolkit for butchering them.
I want to extract the utmost life-force out of their flesh so I just looked up the ike-jime method.
The realization that they suffer from poor treatment and suffocation and their flesh has been proven to taste worse by many others in such cases fills me with excitement in learning new ways to kill and butcher them.
That's an odd hobby
That's just a minor hobby.
Since I'm good at butchering stuff everyone started coming to me when they did their fishing and I'm just getting good at fish too now.
There's only so much the flesh quality can be raised with proper butchering and cutting out pristine fil√©ts, there's ways to kill and bleed them that also improves the quality even more so I had to start fishing too so I can kill them myself.
That is a monkfish/anglerfish

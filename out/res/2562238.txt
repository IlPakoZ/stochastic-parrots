Question for the dry bean grower of last thread, how many plants do you need for decent (supplemental meal ingredient for 3 people) yield?
Way to not include the number in the pic retard I bet you don't even grow your probably a baker creek and no till retard
Have a Japanese boxwood and regular boxwood, both nary 1.5ft high. Want to topiary the first into cloud priming’s (niwaki) and the second into a 3 ball. I want at least a foot of trunk space between the foliage and soil. Can I shape them now or gotta wait a few years for them to be taller?
I was lazy and didnt add a number to the pic oh well then maybe you bake the next thread anon. Only reason I did so was because no one else had and the previous thread was at bump limit and about to fall off the board.
God has forsaken me.
What's the best setup to provide some shade for my garden once the weather starts getting intolerably hot? I have about 200 square feet shaped like a block more or less.
A tree
I can't very well just grow one instantly can I.
Buy a couple and place them in a line. Either potted or in the ground.
I don't live in a climate where anyone would need shade so I can't actually help you
Dear future /hgm/ OP,
The current unnumbered /hgm/ thread is #366. Try not to fuck it up this time.
Hugs and kisses,
Anon
How much of the space do you want to shade and what are you shading?
If you just want a space to sit and enjoy your garden then an umbrella is going to be the easiest option. 
If you need to cover a larger outdoor living space then sun shades or shade cloth would be the simplest and cheapest, just need posts or trees to attach it to. Ugly though, building a gazebo or pergola would fulfill the same purpose and look much nicer especially if you get some grapevines or whatever growing over it.
If you're looking to protect a vegetable garden from the heat then either build a shade house or hang some shade cloth over the garden depending on how much of the garden you need to protect. Shade cloth comes in varying densities depending on how much UV protection you need. Bear in mind that you'll need to maintain ventilation - a dark, high density shadecloth that hangs down over the sides of the garden is going to increase heat rather than reduce it. 
You could possibly also build some trellises or a pergola over the garden beds. More work obviously but if you do it right you'd provide enough shade to cool the garden beds but not so much shade that they'll be unable to grow, as well a providing additional growing with whatever vines you have over the trellises.
What's the best way to hang shade cloth keeping in mind that high winds are common so it will either have to be very strong or easily taken down?
Oh also I'd like to be able to shade all of that 200 square feet. It's for a garden. Potatoes, onions, various cucurbits, rutabaga, artichoke, and a couple other random things.
When I went to the garden centre last weekend, the gardeners told me that you can grow dwarf fruit trees in ordinary patio pots. The trees will remain small and not grow their full height, but you will still get some fruits from the trees. So a bought a few and potted them out in 40L pots. But today I got curious and googled potted fruit trees and some websites say that you need to constantly expand the size of the pots every year so that they can grow, which is defeating the point of wanting the trees and pots to be compact.
Can I just keep these trees in the 40L pots and keep the trees small by pruning them or something? All the trees I got were the dwarf type.
Sorry anon I will MSPaint in a number if I make another OP I usually dont bake the thread only did it because no one else had.
My grandmother has a pomegranate tree &amp; lime tree in her screened in back porch and has not up potted them in years and they still produce fruit/are still kicking. I honestly would not worry about it much just give them nutrients/fertilizer regularly and they will be fine.
Honestly, I'm not sure. For a 200 ft area I assume you'd need to look at what commercial operations are doing and googling various combinations of agricultural sun shade / livestock shade sail / etc doesn't show much that looks easy to take down during harsh weather.
Well now I feel bad for busting your balls about it. It's all good Anon, thank you for baking.
plant sunflowers
Transplanted my bell pepper sprouts today. I'm pretty sure I snapped some of the roots in the process, but I have high hopes they'll pull through.
Well they are native here so I'm sure they'd grow.
they prefer to be called "beaners"
From what I've read it's anywhere between 4-12 plants all the way up to 50 plants per person. I average 1.5-3 pounds of dried beans per 25ft row at 3" spacing. And of course the yields vary on the varieties grown.
That sounds good, guy at the garden centre said to just give it a feeding and it will be fine, like your grandmother's. Hopefully get some nice fruit in a couple of years.
I plant as much as much as I can. The only thing stopping me is 
Beans store well, so there is no upper limit to amount of beans I could grow.
If I have to stuff all the rooms in my house with beans and use them as a seat I'd be euphoric.
If I have to open an door and beans come flooding out of it like water, I'd be ecstatic.
God I think of a giant granary filled with some seeds I grown and harvested myself and I feel genuine excitement rivaling flying your own plane that you built.
Made one of these monkey huts for a festival years ago. I set it up at the peak of summer over my garden. Looks like a more durable design has been made in the interim.

Ew why do you live in the fucking desert?
i dont thats a google pic but theyre popular at burning man which should be a testament to their ability to withstand wind
easy mode? Those seeds have to be wet forever to germ. This shit grows in the wild god has given you a gift amigo.
Rate my Sneeds purchase... im in zone 10a Greece, havent sowed them yet but will this month...
he planted seedlings
50%+ of it already germinated :)
they look good anon. some fuzzy cunt ate the leaves on the one I planted. I guess I need neem oil or some shit
Newfag here. Set up some plastic garden fencing yesterday and it looks like shit. Can't get it to look nice, it's just all floppy and fucked.
Should I just get metal wire fences instead? Or is there a specific way to install plastic fencing? Also I live in a very hot and sunny climate, and in my experience plastic tends to get brittle when left outdoors around here.
(formerly chuck's)
Totally full, hopefully I can get some stuff outside to start to harden off in two weeks
Edit: because we still have to seed the cucurbits
Can brief exposure to the cold harm tomato seedlings? I need to carry my tomato seedling trays to my greenhouse in the morning and back inside in the evening. This time of the year the temperature outside is usually above the freezing point. Each trip the seedlings would spend about 30 seconds outside. At some point i will start heating the greenhouse during the night but that won't be for a while yet.
30 seconds isn't going to harm them unless it's really fucking cold out
always wanted to give growing some stuff a go, but no garden.
Grocery store is having a gardening sale going and they sell a 1m flowerbox (which seem to be pretty rare) for 3€. Its 100 x 17 x 14.
It has 2cm standoffs on the bottom and I was thinking about buying the saucer for it too, drill some holes in it, cut it to size and put it on the standoffs for a watertank? 
It seems like to be foolproof with watering that way.
Would that be enough space for the roots and water down there? Would 12cm of soil be enough?
I was planning to put some strawberries, small tomatoes and herbs in it.
Would there be any benefit to having 2 x 50cm boxes instead of a 1m one?
should maybe convert. 
Flowerbox is about 40 x 6,5 x 5,5 inch
I have a single strawberry growing in about 16cm deep soil, in a pot that's 22cm diameter at the top (standard 10in pot here in Burgerland). It was planted from seed and has lived long enough to start producing berries since about a month ago.
The box you're looking at might be a tiny bit shallow, but strawberries and herbs will probably do fine in it. I don't know enough about small tomato plants to say about that one though. I would give it plenty of small holes all over the bottom to minimize water standing in it.
If you're going to move them around, you might want the two smaller boxes instead of one big heavy awkwardly shaped one.
that makes sense and haven't even thought about it. Will go for the 50cm ones then.
They are running sale on soil, small plants too (i think its called cuttings?). 6x strawberries for 5€, cocktail tomatoe for 1€ and might try peppers too.
No idea how quality they will be, but i'd pay like 20€ for everything.
And if this goes well next year I'll go with seeds.
think i should try to explain myself better on the watertank idea. Thinking about something like the pic, but diy with cutting a piece of plastic to fit into the box. Drill holes into the false bottom and glue a plastic bottle in as a funnel for water.
Or is it trash and I shouldn't bother and just use the saucer for it normally?
Yeah thats how self watering containers work
For the part that protrudes down into the water, you could maybe use a little yogurt cup or something like that. I wonder if hot glue would survive the elements? With or without, it would stay in place long enough to fill the whole thing with dirt anyway.
I like your DIY style, that's how I've been doing a lot of things in my apartment gardening too. Got to put all those ricotta cheese and sour cream containers I've hoarded to use somehow.
it's a pretty funny story actually! Yesterday I bought strawberries on sale and they were terrible (like always).
Was determined to try myself now. Went on amazon put in strawberries, tomatoes, fertilizer and a flowerbox with watertank in the cart. Ended up being 60€, but decided to hold on it, because I'll have to check the store for soil anyways and I thought they might have plants too.
Thursday they always change up their deals and as is if it's destiny its a whole gardening week.
The only thing they don't sell is a box with a water tank, but that motivated me to DIY it!
I'll get back there tomorrow with something to carry all that stuff and see if I can post some pics in here.
I'll have to see if I can borrow a hot glue gun from a neighbour. Otherwise I thought ducktape might do.
I stop at glasjars, but well.. I can never have enough.
I always have some empty cans or bottles, because we pay a deposit and get it back when we bring them back to the store.
First I thought this tall and thin can (like redbull) would do perfectly, but aluminium should be avoided im sure.
A sign from above if I ever saw one.
yall grow any drugs?
i'm thinking on and off about cannabis growing, but I'm also not a fan of me smoking. A friend has a decent sized indoor tent and he got 150-200g out of it the first time.
I'd probably sell half of it to get back power and money from the tent, but i really don't want to be around 80g of weed. I'm the worst breed of stoner whenever I'm alone and around weed. I'd straight up throw a month away 24/7 stoned.
Also I don't want a tent with a vent in my apartment.
The only thing I can see myself doing it is one or two small plants outdoor hidden in a near forest area (its not legal here) per season
How the fuck is Sheffield selling 3000 teaberry seeds for only $26? This has to be fake or something right? That's a lot of fucking teaberry seeds. Do they grow hundreds of acres of it or something?
Don't be me.
its natural for peppers and tomato seedlings to be purple on the leaves and stems. Ya done goofed kid.
I ignored it at first but even the veins turned into purple. And spotty. My previous tomato saplings displayed none of these purple colouration. Either way, don't be dumb like me.
P Subs
I (well, really, my wife looks does most of the gardening) grow opium poppies. More out of curiosity to see whether we could extract any useable product than anything else. We haven't used any since the first couple of seasons.
potatoes just arrived. What do you guys grow your taters in?
I have been very interested in growing opium poppies since I learned how to grow cubensis, I even bought a couple books. I’m only now living in a place with an inconspicuous back yard but my roommates are urging me not to, out of better judgment. Where you able to milk the poppies successfully and make something out of the latex? I wanted to try and make smoking opium and larp as a Manchu-oppressed Han chinaman.
What do you guys think about attaching cheap gutters to the insides of my backyard fence, capping them off, drilling some drainage holes in the bottom, lining with landscaping fabric, filling with potting soil and growing strawberries out of? Feasible?
I assume potted fruit trees produce much less than inground trees, correct...?
It's a common vertical garden. So yes. But best for greens not big veggies. Although you could probably get away with strawberries.
What about the beans sold at a supermarket? 1kg bag should be enough to plant, harvest, and replant.
I cant remember but I watched a guy on youtube who exclusively farmed strawberries out of rain gutters. If you look it up you could probably find his tutorials.
What kind of tree are we talking? In most cases yes a potted tree will produce less.
I've tried in the ground, poly bags, grow bags, straw.
damn there's an influencer for everything these day
not him but in college i had a few 5 gallon pots full of poppies on my balcony. maybe like 3 pots, maybe 4 or 5 plants per pot. 
lanced and i got a little tiny crumb of opium. smoked it with some friends and really only got a few solid hits off. but it was a neat experience and a headrush that i hadn't felt before. it has a pleasant floral scent.
however, i did blend up the pods, boil them in water, and drank the tea. and that was a good dozen or so doses. very unpleasant, poppy tea is not trivial to choke back.
i think the metric was something like, each pod has about 10mg of morphine, which is like a single morphine pill. that's not very much, they normally start people out on like 15mg morphine tablets. 
even if you had a properly large bed of them, you don't get all that much of a harvest. you'd need acres to have anything more than just "fuck around" amounts.
id say, it's fine to grow them. i wouldn't grow a huge bed of them. grow wildflowers and maybe have some poppies mixed in. no one has an entire bed of poppies, and it might give you some negative attention.
i don't know if lancing is really worth it on such a small scale, when you could just process the whole pod down to tea. you'd really need a ton of plants to have an actual ball of opium.
Mother keeps putting humidity domes on already sprouted seedlings saying the moisture helps them grow.
My understanding is that humidity domes are for germination and specialised plants that prefer humid conditions, and that most plants risk mold issues if you keep them under a humidity dome.
Which of us is right?
Just ordered some Mars Hydro lights.
First seed failed to germinate, trying again after a 24hr water soak with a new one.
Might plant outdoor once established
Humidity domes are bad once they're seedlings. They need fresh air and the humidity can promote disease.
Do you guys have nicknames for stuff in your environment? Like when I see a cardinal it's cardi b and when i see a blue jay it's jay z and even my fence post is post malone. (Doesn't have to be rappers though)
look into gibberelic acid. i soak all my difficult seeds, and anecdotally at least it makes a big difference.
keep a fire extinguisher nearby
My garden should make an appearance next week. Currently covered with snow, but the temperature will rocket to 22C on Monday.
Can i use foliar fertilizer for soil drench? How should i dilute it?
Is this place ok to talk about growing weed and sharing pics of our grows?
guerilla growing. Local overseers or teens will find your grow spot and seize it.
Home grown poppy tea is valid.
see the conversation immediately above about growing drugs
Fuck.
If it's that bad I'll return it...
Found these (n)wiggers in my garden. Am I fucked?
Grubs
Do they crawl on their stomach, side or back?
Its not that bad kids dont go into the forest anymore I'm just scared of the foragers
it's over
AHHHH wtf is this shit, you mean they aren't pre stratisfied, I dont' have 2 fucking months to chill their ass
The fuck do I do. It's time to start sprouting them, the temperatures outside are getting warmer(last frost date is 1 month away)
Do I just fucking plant them and hope for the best?
Do I throw them into the freezer for a couple of days and hope for the best. 
Ah AH the fuck do I do?! Time is running out! T-t-time is running out!
https://youtu.be/w7Vu8_EQVXc?t=76 [Embed]
You should test if they are viable and will germinate. soak some and see if they sprout.
And take into account that particular beans temperature and other needs.
Or wait, were you suggesting and not asking?
Put them in the fridge or freezer and try to remember for next season
Ehhh, I could buy more seeds for next season, it didn't cost me much.
Is there any hope of sowing them into the cold ground and hoping for the best?
I imagine the biggest issue with that is even if they do sprout, weeds might overtake them. Guess I should mark out an area keep it weed free and hope for the best.
Maybe. It's certainly cold enough around here to stratify them.
My feels are exactly like this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM [Embed]
Anyone here successfully gotten stevia to grow and have tips? I have failed 3 times now and I just want to give up on this shit. I just want to be able to pull a fresh leaf to sweeten a tea once a week.
I've did the thing. I think I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
I've decided to just use another box for the water tank. Just glued some lego in to have enough space between them.
The strawberries are probably too close to another? I didn't realize at first but the ones I bought were female only so I had to get one more.
I might get another set of boxes on monday so I can spread stuff around a bit more.
Also should I use fertilizer right away or wait for some days?
I miss soil blocks... 
Need some way than to rush in twelve 1020 trays if it starts raining.
Looks great anon! It's even a perfect fit for the window.
female only strawberries
I'm not aware that any such thing exists, the flowers have both parts necessary for pollination (which btw you'll have to do yourself). Is that what the label said they are?
Fresh soil should contain enough nutrients to get everything started, so don't worry about it for now.
Thanks. It did say say so on the tray. It's called Mieze Schindler
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasberry
I would go with metal wire type fencing because plastic is the devil. Also when you buy those big rolls of fencing you can use the extra to make trellises and stuff.
Oh I see, not the type of strawberry I was expecting. Still, I hope you enjoy growing them!
Yea I was actually looking to buy 'normal' ones, but just grabbed the tray of strawberries without really checking, but i don't really want to throw them out now.
I might replace some of them next week. I got Senga Sengana for pollination
i also bought that but died on my bcuz the online nursery sucks hard and came full of spidermites and mostly systemic fungal disease that didnt go away with fosetil, i must buy them soon too, also there are more strasberry varieties, all i can find is:
-Mieze Schindler
-Framberry
-Framberry Red dream
-Framberry anared
not sure if so many actually exist but the ones that are not mieze are presumably self fertile
They don't NEED to be stratified. I sowed Baron Von Solemacher seeds in February and now have 10 plants from one packet. Germination rate was quite low however so maybe stratification would've given better results.
can I grow spring onions in clumps? I scattered a bunch of seed in a raised bed and they've germinated close together
the ones ive got in a patch up against each other are faring better than the row of them i planted. i think thats why they call them bunching onions
My body is red from the sunburn, but it's a light one that doesn't hurt, only lets me "feel it"
Multiple different planting methods of varrying effort level.
We shall see what and how it will grow.
Holy fuck im tired though
Congrats on the tan tanon, working outside is a bitch. Built some garden beds to replace my old ones on the backside of my house yesterday, it fucked me up
Besides sunflowers, what else should a newb try in this abysmal sad brick wall landscape in the desert?
My water bill is not cheap, but I'm not on a budget, I want sick ass plants that cover this shit brick wall. My fabric bags rotted. I want to get 5 gal plastic nursery pots or 5 gal buckets still I hear they hold water better.
cute kot :)
Look at what I'm dealing with.
We had an orange and a grapefruit an maybe 3-5 gallon pots for about 15 years. These were seedlings so not dwarf but they stayed relatively small (~4' for the orange and ~8' for the grapefruit) and they bloomed a few times but never ripened fruit. Eventually we left them outside during a surprise frost and they died.
Aren't there like 100 seeds in each berry? It's not that much really. Also most of them probably won't grow 'cause those itty bitty seeds that require stratification are a real pain in the ass.
I get about .5lbs of dry beans per linear foot of row
As long as it's always above freezing it should be fine but I doubt it will grow in cold weather. Usually I'd transplant them only after the last frost date
https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/japanese-beetles
Does your lawn have signs of Japanese Beetle attacks? Post pictures of the larva's underside
Aloe plants could be fun to try. There's a lot of different varieties from ones that grow on the ground to ones as tall as trees and they have a variety of colors. Some cultivars such as Aloe Vera have been grown for their juice which is said to help with sunburns. Also they're arid plants that like sandy soil so you don't have to worry about watering them as much
New beds going down, lads. If you've never made one, it's super easy. Every level is just 3 planks of wood, one cut in half for the ends. 4x4 in the corners for support. 
Is it the cheapest? No. But if you like the wooden ones, you can make a single level for about $50
Tomatos, peppers and basil
They are all easy to grow and can make pasta sauce and other stuff
Their stringy roots make it possible to separate then easily. Bunched up they won't make nice bulbs. Just dig them up, pull them apart, and space appropriately
why not lowered beds?
Did you know there is different size and color of fava beans?
Survived the summer.
Serious damage to fruit trees from birds, lost half the cane berries to a bone dry summer and late autumn.
Composts failing, machinery broken, weeds out of control, shortage of soil/sand/mulch. Not a good year.
No. 
It attracts people who don't actually grow anything and just want to weed lmao. If you're not smart enough to keep it on the low don't post online at all. Delete sys32, it's in your own interest
It would work just fine, not a bad way to grow strawberries. But for various reasons I'd recommend growing something like passionfruit vines
There's your problem, nothing online is reliable. SEO optimization doesn't qualify you as a horticultural expert and plagurists always reach a concensus
Commercial seed really is that cheap.
Gardeners buy packet seed, smallfarmers retain crops for seed, Commercial farmers grow a crop just for seed.
Compare this
to this and tell me why the difference in your theory.
Best practices to follow and newbish mistakes to avoid when transferring small plants from water to soil?
yes they produce much less &amp; much smaller fruit depending on the size of your container, soil quality, &amp; nutrients that you feed it.
Spring here is so obnoxiously tantalizing. Was -1c yesterday. Can I risk planting my roses, grapes, hydrangeas and Moss Phlox?
don't throw them into the hot sun to get cooked.
kek that’s so fucked up, holy shit
Elaborate?
Anon what is this?
rye
I assume that the photo is showing tilled soil that was thick with roots. Digging even a relatively small hole in soil thick with roots is fucking hard, I don’t think I would even bother trying to till soil that infested.
i...its... its because its focusing in growing roots right ??
oh fuck I got another mole on my neck
wear sunscreen /hmg/bros
I guess mint likes me too
Any of you ever have a gardening related job? How did you get it?
Did mean to quote anon sorry I'm retarded
Didn't*
FUCK
No one tell him.
Dubs of painful truth. That anon is a mint farmer now
It gets worse. Those roots? Thats' Elderweed. It grows as a thick carpet across the entire area and it's all connected. If even a little bit of the root stays behind, it regrows into more elderweed. If you cut down elderweed in one place the elderweed in another place will funnel nutrients to the place where you did cut it down and regrow it through the thickest mulch you can imagine, you literally can't block it out from the sun, because it just gathers sun from other places and sends it there.
It regrows and out competes things because of that. It starts growing earliest spring with the any other earliest plant you can think of.
The picture shows 1 shovel depth layer taken and flipped over, and some of the top dirt raked off. This thick carpet covers everything in my garden.
Just teach yourself biochemistry and discover novel compound in the elderweed that can cure cancer or some shit. Boom, a curse into a blessing. In all seriousness, I’m so fucking sorry for your plight. I pray God delivers you the strength to extinguish the scourge.
Oh there is a benefit to elderweed. It's only really a problem if, and only if, you want to plant something else in said area.
As I shape the land, so too, does the land shape me.
Amen. 
I just read up on it, apparently it was popular with the Romans as a food plant for its tender fresh spring leaves and popular with the monks later on for medicinal and sedative properties. If it wasn’t so prolific I might even think to plant some myself, if only to experiment with these alleged sedative properties.
very nice
private patch or in the wild.
mine went too dry and never fruited...
I have a few fruit trees and a couple of garden beds. Got about 20 plants going in a hydroponics setup in the sun room. Mostly lettuce, herbs, and strawberries.
Tried magic mushrooms a year or so ago and was really interesting.
Got them off an old coworker who supposedly just picks them around. How do you go about learning what to look for when trying to find some? Or some beginner ones to try that is difficult to mistake for a bad one? 
Also if you pinch the stem and it goes kind of blue that means it's good right
You're going to die. You'll pick a deadly Amanita species and say goodbye to your kidneys or liver. Unless you live along the gulf coast and have access to cow pastures, and know how to take spore prints and have a microscope to identify spore, your best bet is to find a friend who knows where to get mushies. It's not hard to find a source if you hang with the right people.
All of those are perennials. You're not supposed to wait for last frost so long as they are dormant plants, you plant them as soon as you can. Do they have leaves? I would probably plant them even if they have leaves and maybe cover them if it freezes.
Where's the best place to buy corn seeds? I'm considering growing corn because, last year, a rogue cornplant ended up in my yard (in july, somehow) and grew almost to maturity before perishing when winter slapped its tits.
australia?
oh boy...
Well I'm from Australia. Surely species will be diff here right? I took pics of the one so was given. They were small and brown.
Would all the ones that grow randomly in the backyard be dangerous lol
Not that anon, but the issue is that the price of a mistake is worth extra caution.
A mushroom from your yard could be dangerous. I mean, you wouldn't eat every flower in your garden.
are you making bricks?
What else am I going to shit?
Has anyone ever let their yard go feral? I have a screened in pool surrounded by empty backyard. I want to let the empty backyard go apeshit but am concerned about how it may look in a couple years.
Lol so I have a pumpkin plant getting a bit crazy and out of controll. Is it just a matter of cutting it back from where I don't want it growing or is there a proper way to snip it back? I only have like 2 or 3 fruits off it too .
what's happening to my poor pothos? its leaves started turning yellow about a week ago. it's been in this spot for about a year now
Last frost for me is like may 15th. I haven't started my seeds yet. Do I have time if I start this week?
Last frost for me is like may 15th.
BROTHER! finally somebody who shares my fate.
Seeds for what anon, it all depends on what you are growing. and also when your first frost day is.
I'm not sure yet. Probably various things. I was gonna do pots but maybe I should get out there and till some land for some crops and build some boxes. Idk. Definitely wanna grow some tomatoes strawberries and peppers. Not sure. I failed miserably last year to produce much of anything lmao
Also I live in southern Colorado where first first is October 5th but really you can keep things growing into November I think depending on weather.
Land is where plants belong, potting is only for people who have no access to land to plant.
Pots in plants depends on the human to take care of them to the full extent. Plants in the land, can do their own thing and survive far more without human intervention.
raised beds
good for plants that need good drainage, inversely kinda poor for plants that need more moisture as the soil dies off quicker and the roots dont go as deep into the ground where the moisture is.
peppers
need to be started early, like right now from seeds and then transplated later when it's warm
strberries
bitch to germinate from seed, slow to grow and require stratification shit for more success, also would start seedlings now
tomatooes
similar to peppers but less so, if I remember correctly
I wont tell you where I am but I had my first frost in fucking august last year after weeks of 86F temps
my growing season is tight tight TIGHT!
lets see what the germination rate on these suckers are.
I expect 10%
Anecdata: I planted 40 seeds total, in two batches of 20 several weeks apart. 3 sprouted in the first group and all grew healthy, but succumbed to a spider mite infestation that I could never get under control. 2 sprouted in the second group, but one must have had some kind of weird mutation because it never grew more than a quarter inch tall sprout. The remaining plant (which has never been put outside) is the only survivor of the experiment.
My last experiment had like I dunno 50 planted
10 sprouted, 3 survived and grew. heres them
same three later
So I had a garden like fifteen years ago. It's overgrown with weeds and bushes and stuff. What's my best course of action here? Do I need to remove all the soil there and replace it? That seems time consuming a bit '
Throw cardboard on top.
Cover that mulch.
Cut holes to plant.
Your could also till the fuck out of it which you might need to do anyways if.its compacted.
southwest (basically) low desert here, besides those try Hibiscus acetosella and Hibiscus sabdariffa
Moringa
If you can deal with thorns Bougainvillea
I'm definitely gonna take a weed whacker to it but the cardboard method is not too bad of an idea all things consider
if it worked for CHAZ, it works for me.
green manure all the weeds and stuff growing on your plot with a brush hog or weed eater your choice depending on how bad it is then plow/till all that biomatter into the soil. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_manure
What is your soil?
are those alpines or regular?
do seed bombs really work? there's this shitty abandoned lot i walk buy practically every day, and I've been thinking about the viability of tossing widlflower seeds or something into the lot. it's got some shitty patchy grass on it but that's it.
it's this, a bit clayish
alpines
answer is:depends
what is the goal
what seeds used
what the soil is like
what the weater is like
etc
But yeah the most important question is what do you want to achieve.
Does anyone else watch Self Sufficient Me
I like the videos I've seen of his.
it bothers me he does't say "lets dig into it"
Yeah mate
This grew out of lemongrass packet. I knew it looked different from the lemongrass seedlings but i grew it out to find out what it is. Now it's starting to overtake my lemongrass pot so it has to go out. Is this just some weed or something worth moving to a different pot? Plant identifying apps dont help.
forgot pic
Why didn't you get any Thrace Melons? They are an old Greek heirloom variety
Yeah i used his code to buy cheap garden beds, saved me like $250 on 10 garden beds. I think he's good for amateurs and people just getting into gardenign.
mints are practically a weed, of you can get them to germinate that is
Jealous, we should have kept the convicts here are moved out
Reminds me of tobacco, where did you buy your seeds?
of course, great lad
fellas
how long do they take to sprout from seed
im going crazy over here and my seeds are at half the ammount I bought and not any reliable aprouting happened
I keep the area moist, and the seeds are above the soil and with sunlight
do they just take fuckton of time? is it too hot? I need advice from more experienced gardeners
I live in a tropical country now but I really want to grow the vegetables I used to enjoy back home.
Any guides/books out there on how to grow temperate crops like carrots, cabbages, beets, radishes, celery, potatoes, etc despite the heat of the tropical sun? I don't want to be limited to be able to grow them only during the winter months. I'm living only a few meters above sea level, and near the coast so the average temp is around 27°C.
I have already accepted that I may never be able to grow my favorite parsnips and leeks here, or blackberries and strawberries, but in exchange for that I will be able to enjoy tomatoes, cucumbers and melons the entire year.
I was thinking of designing raised beds that use evaporative cooling to create a microclimate to suit the temperate root crops like potatoes and carrots. Has anyone done something similar to this before?
Mein Mieze Schindler plonts arrived, thanks for your attentien
Is nanking cherry any good? Was thinking of getting a few to fill a "hardy fruiting shrub" niche.

great lad
honestly the only one I follow regularly on the youtube gardening
unlike everyone else he's not full of shit, condescendence, or hippie bullshit
I hate the feel good gardeners like epic gardening that are always smiling dumbly like gardening is so easy
SSM is a man, has a family and kids, and shows his passion for everyone, and has a shitton of practical experience
he does do some epiosdes that are kinda similar but what can you do
A beaut, very neat and organized, wish i had a grow tent so bad. Do you buy your soil premixed or do you have your own mixture you make?
Bell peppers shrugged off being transplanting like it never even happened. Guess they're hardier than I gave them credit for. It's still a little chilly out, so they'll get to stay inside and be pampered for a while longer.
Can someone explain what exactly happened here? I understand it was likely a healthy group of plants and so it was a bunch of P added to non-P-deficient plants, overdosing or something. But it just surprises me to hear they all died within hours just from regular ol fertilizer.
To no-till or not to no-till...?
It werks, after 3 years or so. Takes time to turn a barren waste into sexy black composted earth.
I don't have any good books as I've never had to do it but you're going to need partial shade and/or sails and a lot more water than usual. There are tropical tolerant varietals and heirloom varieties that can handle the Deep South and many new world victuals came from the tropics so you have a lot of options to test and try out. 
Thinking about it, outdoor pot grows share a number of the same issues and those stoned fucks have ingenium when it comes to solutions.
The smaller scale no till 
Large till or some sort of hybrid approach.
Although with fresh land even no till benefits from an initial till
Thanks anon. Back when we were doing soil blocks we made our own mix but we went with promix hp this year.
free meat anon!
I'm no tilling some onions and shallots and have nowhere to process free meat.
hows that work? you just kick the leaves back and sow the bulbs directly?
i have 3-4 different IMOs now, must pick some moar b4 june
Yeah. Pick out weeds or that creeping calycanthis there and you're good as long as there's enough sun and not too many roots. Seeding carrots with it would be ideal but deer don't fuck with onion as much and I haven't needed to wrap chicken wire for that.
I have bigger fish to fry when it comes to gardening than being optimal.

Hey there anons! What type of palm and palm fruit is this? Thanks in advance.
Upclose
is his name Nigger-Man?
Sorry for the sideways photos, I couldn’t tell you why.
That's how they're actually stored in your phone/camera, and there's a line of metadata that tells your image viewer how to rotate them. However, 4chan strips all metadata from images so people don't dox themselves, and doesn't correct for rotation first, so pictures that rely on this end up sideways here.
this can be resolved by taking pictures correctly, ie: landscape instead of holding the phone vertically.
or, editing the picture in any photo editor, like paint
Oh, interesting. Thanks for the info Anon.
I’m one-handed, so it can be a bit challenging. The screen has also seen better days, so using my nose is a no-go.
that is inconvenient. i was dicking around in the settings on mine to turn on gridlines and found settings for taking a picture with the volume buttons, as well as a little countdown timer so it'll go off after like 5 seconds.
or ya know, do it how you do it and rotate it in paint, that way you know it'll be right
Lesson finally learned. Never buy those boxed dormant plant starters. Something always goes wrong.
Did a little ritual last year, self fellatio in the garden, trying to encourage the growth of phallic veggies. We shall see!
Elaborate.
He’s great, very wholesome and not shy about showing his fuck ups
Opa!
You should handcraft small ceramic gnome sucking himself off in hopes of attracting a jolly little garden spirit into your home
What is the temp during the day where you live? I sowed seeds when the days were peaking around high 50s low 60s (12-18 C) and they even endured a snap freeze, but took almost a month to start sprouting. I wasn’t even all that religious about watering them, because they got a blanket of light snow and a few rains. I actually sowed most of them with about a quarter inch (~6mm) of soil covering them, got some nice rosettes but I moved and had to leave them before they required any management.
that would be cool. it probably wouldn't look out of place among a normal garden either.
It’s legitimately easier to grow them yourself than to try and hunt for them in the wild. You can buy premade spore syringes (for ‘microscopy’) and pre-sterilized grain bags (for use growing only food or medicinal mushrooms, not illicit species) online, for damn cheap. As long as you’re only buy personal use quantities of these supplies the Feds aren’t going to waste resources on you.
you guys think pic is a good garden layout? Was hard to find anything online so I used chatgpt though it doesn't seem to respect its own rules. 
how much fucking dill do you need?
Cardi B
idk the AI likes it apparently I would replace it with Cilantro. Still sucks very much at fitting given requirements I told it to respect 1x4m but as you can see it just doesn't care.
Whenever I've bought dormant root starts from a store they've always ended up being dead or rotten.
A big part of it is that they seem to bring the fucking things into the heated store interior instead of keeping them outside. So they come out of dormancy in the storeroom, and then by the time they hit the floor they're dead already.
Teaberry is grown as a ground cover most of the time and it's fruit isn't really suitable for cooking or jam. although you can use it to flavor stuff. It must be like buying grass seed. You dump it all out in an empty area and hope the seeds stratify.
It also has a piss poor germination rate and seems to die if you attempt to transplant it 100% of the time. If anyone knows the secrets to getting teaberry to survive in a garden, please be a friend and supply that information.
Ordered some small teaberry runners with leaves last year and stuck them in the ground (Small layer of sandy loam backed by almost pure sand). About half of them died, and the rest are still dormant with reddish leaves save one, which I acquired through means outside of germination or ordering. I think the secret is to live in there native habitat, because I've found tons of them on trails not 30 minutes away from me. Did you try amending your soil?
Also, I'm probably going to go through the same hell as you with Pink Lady Slippers, since I'm trying to start ten of them.
I think a common trait for both plants is that they like broken sunlight and tend to thrive in the semi-shaded understory. Pink Lady Slippers in particular tend to show up on embankments and sandy patches, so to me that suggests they enjoy water running across their roots rather than soaking in. Which is, I believe, classic orchid behavior, just adapted to a temperate environment. It also means they're probably a massive pain in the ass.
the AI is dilligent
Sounds like periwinkle and other ground cover. Hardy as shit in the right environment but covering it with leaves in the fall seems counter intuitive. There are a lot of ground plants out there that do well in poor soil and bad light and I've seen it fail when you don't have those conditions. It's like those cabbage green looking things that only grow in bogs along shaded creeks. They're the only thing that grows there.
skunk cabbage
have you tried biodegradable pots ? these are always smol though
Oh my god.
When do you transplant your squash? Every year it quickly outgrows its container, won't be able to plant it outside for at least a month, unless I figure out how to save it from frost
Excess of fertilizer can burn the roots.
Compare throwing too much fertilizer to the ground to throwing too much salt to your soup.
The only difference is that you, unlike the plant, can run away from over-salted food.
Google over-fertilization for more on that.
And next time, read dosing instructions for your fertiliser and don't give a seedling a dose suitable for a large potted plant.
I think that's the stuff, never noticed it looking like this in late winter but now I know.
I do it after the first two leaves are done forming, and I will usually harden the seedlings over the course of their growth before transplanting to get them used to the climate
Some small animal (probably a squirrel) dug up one of my newly buried potatoes and bit a few small chunks out of it before leaving it. When I found it this morning, It was mostly intact and I reburied it. It was a large seed potato. Could it still grow?
It'll probably be fine, as long as there was still at least one eye on it.
Potatoes sound like they'd go great with squirrel stew.
Cool to see other people interested in growing teaberry too. I would love to have an abundance of it everywhere so I don't only have it when I'm in the woods. I love it. Last year I tried to start it from seed, cold stratified it, had a couple of seedlings come up, but they died. It was in potting soil, so maybe it wasn't acidic enough? This year I just bought starts and they came with leaves looking pretty good. I put them in the wood chips beds under the Rhododendrons. We have a heat wave right now so trying to keep them moist hopefully the heat didn't kill them after transplanting or I didn't under or over water
Zone 6b. Last frost is mid May. April is a hard month for me mentally. I want to be in the garden my dudes. I have all my seeds started and I’m doing bed prep and other prep. I can’t wait to put some plants in the ground
That’s pretty autistic. I prefer to call things by their actual name. Although I do call butterflies “flutterbies”.
I'm in the niche between 5b and 6a and have been working my ass off already to get things started and set up. I have a dozen crops already going. The trick is to realize that, even with the danger of frost on the table until May, you have a lot of stuff you could've started back at the tail end of March. Or earlier, given you're lower.
What do you start early and how do you protect from frost
Peas, cabbage, swiss chard, kale, various types of berries, and an assortment of other things. Anything I worry about with regard to frost is in a pot and set up where I can wheel it into cover if need be.
Zone 6b. Last frost is mid May. 
We are literally in the same zone.
April is a hard month for me mentally.
Why
 I want to be in the garden my dudes.
Then do so, I'm already planting things and taking in the sun while in my underwear, boots and gloves.
Put some frost tolerant crops then?
Stop being a dick
My last frost date in 6B is in a week on the 16th through the 20th according to my local ag extension though I probably wont get plants in the ground till the first week of may unless your weather is bad I dont see why you cant put your plants in the ground starting next week. Best of luck to you &amp; your garden anon.
Tips on helping germinate older squash seeds?
wet paper towel in a container. If they don't pop they probably aren't viable. Watch closely so they don't try to root in the towel.
Don't fold them over in the towel. Just put them on top of a moist towel in a closed container (deli cups work)
Ended up doing out last plantings in soil blocks. Might as well go back to old reliable. The 72 cell and 6 packs were easy to plant but wasn't getting the same results as the last 8+ years with soil blocks
"doing our"
something ate most of my grape hyacinths, and i know i did absolutely nothing to protect them, but i'm still a little irked about it
they were so pretty :'(
Easiest vegetables to grow?
Those are one of my favorite flowers, I used to care for a wonderful elderly lady who grew them in huge bunches. She let me take a few bulbs and they even started growing before I moved. Wonder what’s eating them, I’ve never seen anything touch them where I live. I stole a good deal of hydrocodone from her and almost ODed kek.
I’ve always had outrageous success with cucumber, and all I ever did was put seeds in the dirt and water them. Let a few of the bastards grow big enough that I could use them as fleshlights, and of course they double as dildos if you’re into that. Tasty too, I grew a variety that grew quick thick and still tasted good at larger sizes.
Mostly I call things outside my own body niggers or something with nigger attached to it. Other times i call things completely made up nonsense names
I have never had so much trouble starting seedlings indoors. I believe I fucked myself the first go this year by starting some sweet potatoes with old potting mix (heard it was bad, but never had a problem before). Harvested like a hundred slips off that tray but fucked the rest of my starts. I started 2x 72-cell trays of tomatoes and 1 of peppers. Wifey and I can for a family of 6 so we grow a lot. Always grew heirlooms, but I'm a really cool guy and tried some of the commercial hybrid varieties of tomatoes (Invincible, Tachi, and another) and peppers this year. They all died and I tried two more sets of 3 trays ($fuckton). The first set got real bad. By the last set, I did everything I could think of. I sterilized everything including the surfaces. Was super precise with bottom watering. Fancy new air-pruned cell inserts. Growing medium was Pro-Mix bx with some pelleted sloow release fertilizer mixed in. Even misted with chamomile tea. Left the heat mats on all the time until seeds sprouted. What more can I do? Is it possible my (half-finished, well-ventilated) basement where I start my seeds is just a cess pool of fungus and I keep infecting my shit? Can I add some sort of amendment to the starting medium to stop the funguses? Help please. Pic attached is last set when I decided to throw in the towel.
Fucks wrong with you
Get help
I do this too 
Maybe my seedlings have an aversion to the n word and that's why they always die short
This year I am going to try growing small pumpkins. I have a basic idea of what to do, however, I wanted to ask if any of you have any advice on growing pumpkins. Anything I should do or not do?
Pic related is the seed packet
If i punched holes on the side of a regular pot with a soldering iron similar to the holes on this air pruning pot, would it have the same effect? These pots are kind of expensive.
Radishes must be one of the easiest. They don't require much fertilizer and grow relatively quickly. Lettuce and Tomato plants are also pretty easy.
you okay there bud?
The amount they can grow in 24 hours is crazy, I'll have to repot today or tomorrow.
What would /hgm/ recommend for low cost acceptable fertilizer for cucumbers, corn, tomatoes, peppers, watermelon, cantaloupe, etc...
An all around on-in-all fertilizer for the garden?
Aged urine
What’s the point of this?
You ain’t never lived less you cocked a cucumber, lube’s built in and by the time you cum it’s basically destroyed so you just chuck it in the compost pile.
I'm sure your a hole is basically destroyed from all the pp and cucumbers being rammed up there
Please get help
look it up and apparently exposing the roots to air kills them off and forces the plant to continuously grow new roots which for some reason benefits the plant
*looked it up
It has begun!
Low cost? Chicken manure or organic granural fertilizer are the cheapest. Not too sure if you need something specific at the later stages when the plant starts fruiting or if it's somewhat negligible.
Granular* these are slow-releasing pallets by the way, but they're easy to store, don't expire fast, and you can turn them into liquid by pouring it with water for 24 hours.
Piss, unironically. Keep it off the leaves and it's perfect for starting plants without burning them and fights off a lot of infections and invasive shit.
I never used one as a dildo, only as a fleshlight pal. Get your facts straight.
isnt that thing full of chemicals and antibiotics and so on?
If you are in a part of the world where they raise cows/sheep/chickens then ask your local farmer if you can help clean up some of the older manure in his fields/farm to help your garden and most farmers will let you for free or if you give them a portion of your gathered manure they will let you keep the rest. If you are in the US ask that farmer what his favorite beer or whiskey is and buy him a 6 pack or a handle of it and you will have made a friend for life.
this might be a stupid question anon but I have never used compressed soil blocks for starting plants. What are the advantages and how do they not fall apart once they are watered?
Good day on the allotment. The soil from last year in the left and right beds is still looking good and we've planted strawberries in the middle one. Probably going to be growing strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, beans, and rhubarb this year.
The only disadvantage is that you have to be careful when hardening them off. I'm not kidding there is almost not disadvantage to them. Obviously it takes a bit longer to make the mix etc but really not much longer to fill a 72 cell tray properly. They can't get rained on. We don't have any covered area where they can be left outside 24 hours a day. We have them on a kitchen rack and when its going to rain we bring them all in. When watering you don't overhead water. you can use 1020 trays or basic plastic lunch trays and you water the side of the tray until they soak up all the water.
Also, what the fuck is this
It's a wickety grub.
one more thing as to how they don't fall apart when you water. This is our tomatoes from last year. Once they start to get two sets of true leaves the block is pretty much held together by the roots. When you transplant its pretty much a huge mass of roots and they just explode when they go into the ground/.
I got this packet of soil with strawberry seeds from lowes. "GUARANTEED TO GROW". Bullshit. None of them fucking grew. Waste of five bucks
Protein
local garden centre is selling soil improver loose for cheap
can i use it for germinating seeds?
cockchafer larvae
that no-till guy charles dowding does it, so yes?
If you frequently eat eggs then crushed egg shells can be used as a calcium supplement for plants which can help prevent blossom end rot. It also keeps the slugs away
Anon, there is so much alchemy you can do with piss and eggshells you could fill a book with it. I quickly realized it was going to be over 1400 pages with half a million citations and quickly stopped in that endeavor.
I fucking hate April. Can't plant shit in this weather.
There are studies that say you can make a dilluted tea extract, which actually works for it to be absorbed. Plain crushed eggshells hardly do anything. And even then, chalk which contains calcium and magnesium are cheap as well. Calcium also tends to bind with nitrogen, so never fertilize and add calcium at the same time.
120 zinnias planted
but why?
Meanwhile we've been having 90 degree days
Here are some picks of my 1 year old teaberries. They're still red but I've gotten a few 80-90° days and a really good rain a few hours ago so (I think) that's changing. I lost a few in the first year, probably to the heat.
Here is a pick of my most successful one. I think it is sending up new shoots, but I'll have to watch it develop. It was, not surprisingly, sourced from the wild, while the rest were some cultivar or something.
I'm also doing beach plum, hopniss, groundcherries, and swamp pink, so if you want any info on those I can post pics and whatnot later on.
These are my plants. I planted them about 3 weeks ago. This past week we had hot weather and no rain until today. They definitely don't seem HEALTHY but they're not dead, I don't think, so here's to hoping.
I'll stay hopeful for you also, feelsgood that other people are starting out 
I just started a tray with some winter variety spinach and chocolate scorpion peppers myself, any other east/aus here growing stuff in this indecisive weather?
Yeah right gtfo if here
Then I guess you have a touch of 'tism too
Pretty you just plant then water, weed, and fertilize. And they'll do the rest. You might have to hand pollenate them if there isn't alot of insects. If you want larger pumpkins you may have to thin them.
you can just do this with a bag, look up grow bags
It's safe to say, its another year without pumpkins.
some people just want to see the world blossom
The forbidden brownies
nobody is going to stop you
I used to top with vermiculite, really looked like brownies topped with crushed nuts
Just an update for possible other soil blockers. You can go another few inches tall past this point with a standard 2in block 
The up potted ones in the back weren't going in till early june for my bro so we had to up pot them. Our LFD is May 15th so they pretty much had to go another month.
I've planted some spinach seeds outdoors but on the package which I forgot to read it says that it should be planted 1-2cm deep but I planted it maybe 10cm deep. Am I fu ked?
Yeah, probably. Seeds only have so much energy in them. The smaller the seed, the less energy, the less ability to generate green to fight through soil.
Damn. How long should I wait to restart the process?
I'd probably try to stir up the soil to try and reclaim some seeds towards the surface and then just lay down more seeds. If the originals manage to pop up, I'd just shuffle them. Or ignore them and regret it later.
smaller the seed, the closer to surface it has to be.
I plant strawberry seeds right on top of the soil for instance with some kind of cover. While big stuff like potatoes go into the ground bravely.
its nearing 20 degrees now, bit of a heatwave
im in the equivalent of 9a 
im seeding them indoors, and transplanting later
I heard they dont do the best in transplants but i figured if I cant grow them outside I should try for inside first
after 8 days, I see three tiny seedlings
I have no idea, it werks, im very happy
airlay some cherry branches for months during autumn/winter
nothing
 cut them up and strip the bottle with moits coco coir expecting some healthy root system
nothing
what the fuck
have they rooted? when can one make sticks root and when not? do I have to wait until a different season now?
I also cut some thin branches from a local mulberry tree because I liked the fruit they did and wanted it for my garden
the twigs I put in water in autumn did some green but never rooted, the ones I cut now in spring i put in soil in a humidity dome all in a bucket with soil
They ARE putting out more leaves than last time but how tf I know if they are rooting?
I feel like I need some serious help here and like Im bumbling around
ha!
NEW BREAD
It can take months, particularly if the plant in question was dormant when the cuttings were taken.
Expanding, I'd say let them stay there and get established. Maybe dig around them to give them a good bit of dirt to root into and, if you care to, move the entire blob of earth wherever you want it. But yeah. If it's leafing and flowering, it sounds like it's alive and rooted.
sorry for being a noob. may i ask what are these blocks and how do you make them?
don't they dry out quick?
my blocks are made from 4 parts sifted peat and 1 part sifted composted cow manure. You use something called a soil blocker. Takes a bit to get used to how wet it needs to be. I like them a bit wetter than most of what is on youtube. 
The bigger blocks don't dry out any faster than standard 4 o 6 packs. The smaller ones do but like any gardener you just need to keep an eye on them.
Cayenne peper and butterhead lettuce
Added too much perlite in the lettuce's soil i think
ive been storing old foodscraps in a 55 gallon trash can for a while now (almost full). can i turn this into compost by mixing browns or should i just bury it with my topsoil? most of the stuff in this can is black (and smells similar to a city dump). picrel
Stir it up more. If there's meat in it it is not ready yet.
will do. i've read that we need to do mix browns and greens to get compost, but i haven't put any browns in or aerated it. there is no heat generated, so this isn't really "composting"
I hope you aren't keeping this trash can anywhere you live, because that shit is going to full of all kinds of fun molds.
I have a similar story
Pretty cool outcome, and now I know my rights and I'm doing my own tree maintenance from now on.
dump it out, mix in wood chips / hay to aerate. Smell should dissipate quickly in the sun.
Drill holes in container to add air flow. Anaerobic environment makes for stink, and poor compost.

We seem to have some debate over med kits so let us discuss them. I carry;
I don't see a reason to carry more. What do you carry?
I'd add some Bactine for sterilizing wounds and killing the pain, and some iodine for cleaning them out. And gauze. More fucking gauze than you know what to do with. And at least one dose of QuickClot for leakers. Other than that I think you're good.
Checked and kek'd, I'm enjoying the first aid gatekeeping in the UL thread. I've got a little boo-boo kit for day hikes and overnighters:
I have a more serious kit if I plan to be way out for multiple days. It does not have chest seals.
When you say "dose" of QC, do you mean one of their sponges, or a powder form? All I see from the actual company these days is dressings.
You need a tourniquet, burn spray, some type of sting treatment, and butterfly stitches as well. Maybe those disposable scalpels too. Picrel for simple tourniquet.
No idea what UL is but you should have a chest seal with you.
No blister treatment? Get some leukotape and a safety pin. It’s probably the single most common hiking injury. 
Add some gauze and you can make your own bandaids. The adhesive on the leukotape is way, way better than bandaids, and it can be cut to different shapes and sizes (quite easily if you have scissors).
bait/10
I'd rather have them sit in my pack and collect dust than not have them and suddenly need them in a dire situation.
I use so many of these fuckers while /out/
Tbh yeah I'd just buy a whole box of them. They're great for all kinds of stuff.
An israeli bandage is a tourniquet
I think a lot of people overlook how simple a TQ can be. If you're seriously leaking, you don't have time to fret over a sterile TQ with a carbon fiber windlass and hypo-allergenic velcro. You can use all sorts of shit.
I read that a tourniquet goes above the wound while the Jew bandage goes over it. Either way, no one in this thread has ever had to use one while out. Inb4 “yes I did.” No you didn’t. Take your bullshit LARP back to /k/.
Even rope can be used as one.
The jew bandage has enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. The reality is that if you're applying a tourniquet then you think you're going to die. There's no need to apply both. You can completely cut off the circulation to the limb using the jew bandage as a tourniquet so there is no need to use it as a bandage.
I didn't read your entire post and only just saw this. What the fuck are you talking about. Stop schizo ranting in every damn thread you weirdo.
Post more packing lists, bros
I can’t be bothered to read four short sentences
Maybe you should so you don’t have to ask
Man half your post was you dropping a pre-emptive argument it's no wonder I mentally filtered it kek. It's weird to see. I have never had to nor claimed that I have had to use a tourniquet however if I do both my snake bite bandage and my israeli bandage can be used as a tourniquet. I'm much more likely to slip over and slash an odd part of my body on a rock, this is where the israeli bandage comes into play but the snake bite bandage can also be used. There's no need to start dropping pre-emptive arguments based on nothing but your own imagination. I'm hoping I never have to apply a tourniquet. There's also no need to carry a dedicated one as both my bandages can do the job.
So you’ve never had to use one. Great.
Also great lol
Are you arguing just for the sake of arguing.
Yeah nah. Your trolling attempt is lazy. 
My bad, I thought an Israeli bandage was for stuffing wounds.
But a normal tourniquet is also $25 on Amazon. It's easy enough to get one, throw it in the outer pocket of your pack, and forget about it. I wouldn't want to be attempting to tear my shirt or use rope or something if I'm bleeding that badly.
It is but it has enough compression to be used as a tourniquet.
Don’t forget your chest seal and your BVM, because you never know, right? (People with experience do know).
This is bait, right?
It’s pretty good because I can’t tell for sure
You have to leave the house first.
Why are you like this?
Pretty sure it's one guy going to every thread and sperging about his "experience"
This is the motto of a true LARPer. It’s kind of like a condom; you’ll literally never need it.
Seems like it.
I have never said such things. In Australia it's pretty normal to carry a snake bite and a trauma bandage.
Is it normal to have to use them?
I don't know.
It's definitely bait. Nobody is seriously going to advise something like burn spray, but then also say you need chest seals.
It assuredly is not Anon. Israeli Dressing is a pressure dressing, it goes on the wound. Tourniquet is a tourniquet, it goes high and tight to restrict blood flow to the wound. It takes like 30s of internet searching to figure this shit out.

An israeli bandage provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. If you tear one sleeve off your shirt, that torn sleeve provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. If you carry any type of rope, that rope provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. If you carry a snake bite bandage, that snake bite bandage provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. In most cases your shoelace provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet.
Why the fuck are you weirdos so obsessed with dedicated tourniquets. All it has to do is cut off circulation.
Careful, he's going to call this bait.
Yeah, i forgot that this is /out/ where nothing bad ever happens and your super minimalist UL kit will never be a detriment to you. Helping others is also super overrated, so i will only carry medical gear and tools, that apply to my increadibly narrow use case.
Because if I need a tourniquet I want to use a tourniquet. Not the sleeve of my shirt or waste my Israeli bandage by tying it ABOVE the wound and then having to find a windlass. If you're able to stop the bleed from a wound by applying direct pressure to it, then you didn't need to use a tourniquet in the first place. If you can provide some valid documentation proving otherwise I'll happily concede the point.

Bro just take a pic of the gear you're advocating for it isn't difficult.
Anon, I was making fun of the TQ shill not you.
Ah
you are lucky, that i am drunk right now, otherwise i wouldnt drop so low as to reply to a parasite like you.
I am genuinly disturbed by you people, you might not realize it, but you will end up killing someone with your rhetoric.
I fixed this with a leather belt, i wouldnt have been able to do that on myself, loosing blood, without a proper tq, this picture 2as taken on the last day i left home without a cat.
I'm not sure, if you're advocating, for fancy expensive TQs, or whatever you have to hand, though it certainly seems, as though, you survived, with, only, a, be,lt.
Is “he” in the room with you right now?
A he just flew over my house
I think he is saying that this happened to someone else and he was able to use a belt, but if he had a similar injury while alone he would not have been able to use a belt to stop the bleeding which is why he carries his chainsaw accident kit.
this
i am advocating for you to get whatever training and gear you can to save your friends or yours life.
It is amazing how fast the human body looses strengh, once you poke a hole in it. You wont be able to rip your sleeve and improvise a TQ, if a major artery has been nicked. Be trained, be prepared, be ready.
Why the fuck are you weirdos so obsessed with dedicated tourniquets. All it has to do is cut off circulation.
Because dedicated tqs work better
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2738052
In a study of 102 laymen who had just completed an ACS Bleeding Control Basic training only 32.4% of participants were able to correctly apply an improvised tourniquet (defined as one that provided sufficient pressure to halt bleeding) even in a non-stressful situation when provided with appropriate materials (i.e. they didn't have to think about taking their belt off or searching for a windlass). In comparison 92.2% of participants correctly applied a CAT tourniquet.
Interestingly people were better off with an improvised tq than using SWAT-T or RATS.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26125163/
Without a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 99% of tests (79 of 80 tests). With a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 32% of tests (p &lt; .0001).
In a study80 hospital employees (including a mix of healthcare professionals and non-healthcare hospital employees) 32% of subjects were able to stop simulated hemorrhage on the initial improvised tourniquet trial, this number rose to 68% following simulator-based training instructing them on the use of commercial and improvised training. In comparison 94% of subjects using CAT tourniquet were able to successfully stop simulated hemorrhage. 
Read that again, even after dedicated training and practice only 68% of individuals could control bleeding using an improvised tourniquet. This was in ideal situations after being provided with a wide variety of appropriate tourniquet materials, and applying it to a manikin rather than one-handed on their own body.
So lessons from this
Carrying a TQ makes sense if your hunting or logging or something like that, but your just packing your fears if your thru hiking or wilderness backpacking
Short dayhike
SWAT-T 
SWAT-T is a shitty tourniquet unless you know what you're doing and have had the opportunity to practice on a simulator but it is significantly lighter than anything else, and can also be used to improvise a pressure dressing or a splint

Not hard to get shot by someone who's mistaken you for a turkey
What a sad statement 
I don’t take a hatchet when wilderness backpacking, that’s bushcraft LARP shit, and you shouldn’t be carelessly walking around with it like that in the first place.
What kind of retard doesn’t either carry it with the sheath on, or at least with the blade facing away from them?
Either way, I would put using an axe or hatchet in the same catagory as chainsaw or gun.
If you’re doing something that could mangle or kill you accidentally when using it, then yah carrying a tourniquet makes sense.

In theory, yes. In practice, it's highly unlikely you will be able to do it correctly and such a thin line will cause excruciating pain to your patient.
Why americans have to make everything "tactical"?
I just carry a bunch of gauzes, and an elastic bandage.
some of the best comedy i've read all week
lmfao bwahahahahhahahahahahhahahaaaaa
what do you guys carry your fak things in? i use a 1L ziplock bag but want to switch to something more durable but similar weight.
Could you post your picture of yourself or any identifying tattoos so that if I'm ever in a position to rescue you I'll know to just go ahead and let you bleed out.
https://www.cloudgearstore.com/product-page/new-square-zip-pouch
I used a military tear away IFAK I picked up at a surp store. Cheap, effective, keeps shit organized, 500d so abrasion resistant and generally water repellant.
Weighs a tad more than Ziploc but not by much, and it's offset by the endless seething it generates in weirdly obsessive anti-tactical crowd.
Lol bushcrafting is larping tho, why you so upset?

the last thing i want is one of you untrained retards trying to perform bush surgery on me. just let me die if i fall off the ropes. fuck's sake.

There is an advantage to having a bright red bag with "FIRST AID KIT" written on it. If someone else needs it, they can find it. As opposed to a package that could be anything.

In addition to all that, I carry a surgical stapler with me in case of a real emergency.
Pic rel is the kit I carry when hiking and pretty much day to day too
Well, looks like you've got some good pain killers at least.
The spoon is from my cook kit
I like how you cut down the handle, very UL of you.
I read this, and variants of it, so often on /out/ that I too might start to think there are only four actual people who use this board. Bear in mind that just because you don't see a reason doesn't mean it isn't there. You don't see 99.9% of spiders, either, but they're there.
I hope you have some wild adventures, because that H is guaranteed going to kill you.
I think there's a decent few people here, but definitely just a handful who keep shitting up threads with contrarianism. There's the boomer who says that everything is nonsense, the "experience" guy, one who says that everything is a larp no matter what, maybe a couple of others. They're all pretty obnoxious.
What?
There's (I assume) one guy who posts in multiple threads, shitting on other anons with references to his experience, or how his experience "lines up" with everyone else's, so anyone who disagrees with him "doesn't go /out/".
Why the fuck would I need a tourniquet to walk around in the woods for a couple of days I’m not about to step on a fucking landmine
Idk about you, but I’m much more willing to listen to someone who can prove they have experience with what they are talking about than some anon with no proof.
Agreed; you'll never see these assholes proving their experience. They're just here to gatekeep.
Yea except I have. I'm an arborist and one of the climbers I was working with didnt use his lanyard and swung into his chainsaw blade, he zipped down and I tourniquet'ed his arm and wrapped some gauze/blood clot gauze around it and drove him to the hospital. We weren't even issued actual medical kits on the jobs just basic bitch boo boo kits. I had a personal trauma kit in my bag.
Important for all readers, first aid actions are almost universally limited to keeping the blood in and the body working long enough for someone with real training and real equipment support to do the real saving. Which is exactly why purpose built items like a good TQ (cat, softtw) are a thing, because several years of GWOT have shown that even crayon eaters can save lives with this one simple trick. Agree with most others here though, the complexity of the kit increases as risk (hatchets, trail difficulty and remoteness, hunting season) increase.
Your actually more likely to use one on the ride to and from the trail, so a car kit is pretty good kit.
freezer bags with zip are tougher than regular zip bags, buy at same place
Is being an arborist in some suburb really /out/?
Do you have a TQ experience to share?
Simply being outside of a building does not mean you are /out/, and the guy he was responding to said
Personally, I don’t consider anything done in a suburb to be /out/
/out/ disagrees. The board considers literally anything done outside to be an outdoor activity. If you step into your backyard to smoke a pipe, these retards think that counts. It’s an obvious diversion from the norm, where “the outdoors” is understood to be outdoor recreation, ie things that can’t generally be done in a city or suburbs.
Do you see how retarded that is?
Well yeah, except for Golf.

I am not joking
Occupational first aid kits, whether they are for yourself or your team, cannot contain any pharmaceutical products
So everyone who has a first aid kit needs to carry two, so if there is an incident you can tell HSE you just used the legal first aid kit and the "comfort kit" is your prescription medication even though everyone knows it's basic shit
This is the same country where complimentary plastic cutlery was removed from petrol stations and ready meals etc because they're legally a weapon, so that should tell you all you need to know about the quality of our laws
I'm an unrepentant optimist who carries a blister kit and ibuprofen, gauze, and tape. This has always worked for me, but I unfortunately watched a person die from a fall. A tourniquet wouldn't have saved her, but after reading this thread I think a CAT will go with me on some outings.
When the fuck am I ever going to need to use a tourniquet
You never know bro, you gotta be prepared for ANYTHING!
Do you bowhunt, ice climb, or camp out with an accident prone retarded friend? I do all three.
I don't even carry a tourniquet when we pig hunt with dogs... how could I require a tourniquet from how hunting even with a catastrophic arrow failure that sends it through my hand no tq needed
Walking down a steep muddy slope you slip, trip, and fall forward. Your bow flies outta your hand and an arrow lands with the broadhead pointing up at you. The broadhead pierces your femoral artery. Ok, I know it's a long shot but I have tripped, let go of my bow, and an arrow came out of the quiver. I'm not saying you should carry a tourniquet, just saying that I will because 6 razor sharp pointy sticks is enough for me. Also, my fukken idiot brother slipped while climbing up to his stand and landed on his bow.
there's your problem
What the fuck is up with you american larpers and your obsession with tourniquets?
Do you keep crayons in your first aid kit for calories?
I don't walk with a nocked arrow. The bow landed in a bush and I'm guessing a branch popped the arrow out.
Recently I read about a hiker who stepped off the trail and found a broadhead tipped arrow with his leg. It was all over the news a couple of months ago. I think there was a thread in archerytalk with a few posters saying they've found arrows in the bushes or whatever. I found one (field trip) in tall grass, so this kind of thing happens.
Field trip not trip^^
Tip, motherfucker ^^
Their opinions are based on YouTube and a just-in-case logical fallacy. 
https://andrewskurka.com/backpacking-first-aid-kit-gear-list-downloadable-checklist/
You got it wrong. We're obsessed with guns. The tourniquets just come along with it.
We bleed more easily because our blood isn't clotted up with pfizer juice
Who says I work in the suburbs? And no, felling and climbing trees all day isn't an /out/ activity apparently lmao.
Is being a dipshit on /out/ really /out/?
It’s not.
I carry a gun when I go /out/, so best to carry one just incase of accident.
Come on man, everyone knows that you don't actually go /out/ unless you sit at home and shit on people for having things you don't want them to have. /out/ isn't a place; it's a state of mind.
on Clutch
You said you’re an arborist, not a logger or forester, so you’re trimming people’s trees, most likely in a suburb.
Is walking on a dirt trail in a city park /out/ to you too?
What if there is even a hill?
Location matters in determining what is or isn’t /out/
It's okay, anon. Getting the joke is hard, we know.
Nope, apply both for safety, TQ first then I bandage 
Use specialised equipment or you can explain why you used jungle creepers to stop your bleeding to Jesus
t. Combat medic
A small pack of kaolin bandage/ quikclot would probably be more suitable for most people on the trail than quikclot. You can buy it in small packets the size of a gauze pad
Shit. I meant more suitable than a tourniquet
So if you don't have a CAT handy you just let the man die? Is that really what they teach you guys now?
Anon there was a linked article in this thread that showed that improvised TQs were ass. The comment is obviously not saying to not improvise if you must but that there are proven TQs and that if you are considering preparing for major trauma it would be stupid to insist you are prepared to the best ability by just improvising.
Accidents occur all the time. A pack of gauze and a TQ cover a lot. Anything beyond a few minutes from immediate professional and equipped help is potentially a fatal injury that you could help prevent for the low price of knowing some shit and items costing less than a night out.
They do not. You have never needed a tourniquet and you’ve been out since you’ve spent so much time out that you’re practically a tree.
I wonder how many people die per year because they sprung a leak in the woods and didn't pack anything to stop it because "you'll never need it". There's got to be statistics somewhere.
Normally I dont even bring the duct tape. I like my stuff to be multi purpose, and multi use. Most injuries you sustain will either not be physical, or be inconsequential. Yes, a cut that bleeds for five minutes before stopping is inconsequential. tape that shit and move on. If you manage to fuck up bad enough that you need actual bandages, then you better hope you have a buddy. 
Feel free to tell me im retarded, because this is just in my experience/what others have told me.
Zero.
Dangerously retarded
Uhhh what kind of injuries are you suffering, anon?
I probably should have worded that better, lmao. I meant the main threats you should have contingencies for are from exposure. Dehydration is a lot more likely than a compound fracture, and if you're one of those herbalist types, you had BETTER have something for poison. 
My main point was that if you find yourself suddenly with a sucking chest wound, odds are you will not be patching yourself up. If you find yourself with a deep cut, just tape it. If you find yourself with a cut artery, you best tie off your limb right the fuck yesterday, because you have seconds before you get woozy. Dont be the kind of guy who pre-ties a tourniquet to every limb, and wears chain mail, but also don't be the guy who brings a wet wipe and some band-aids and says "yeah ill manage".
This guy gets it.
I don’t think it’s that common. It probably is close to zero. When it comes to hiking it’s only like 140 people a year. About half are from falling off of mountains while climbing. Then you have drownings, a few animal attacks (including bee stings), natural causes, and exposure.
I think I saw that the top cause of death (in US parks) is drowning. I'm sure I can find numbers for exsanguination if I dig.
Yeah, that’s the statistic for National Park visitors. There are statistics specifically for hiking somewhere.
That's confirmed dead annually. Thousands of people go missing, and are never found annually. The answer is likely in the hundreds.
Really? That’s interesting. Can you post any kind of proof?
Thousands, Anon.
Thousands.
Why, certainly anon. I'm glad you asked!

30,000 people annually across the country aren't found
But of course, that includes cities, suburbs, and such. We wand more specifically, the woodland.

This is all the people who had calls put out. I would wager there are at least double this number who never got a call. Naturally, this will vary by year, but I doubt its a double digit percentile.
Ditch the cord for CAT and bobs your uncle.
Cable?
Go back, nerd
To... nugget fest?
anyone tried this Snakestaff EDC tourniquet? curious what people's impressions are, I've been wanting one for daily carry but seems like backpackers might also like it for the weight/size
you gave to be 18 to post here
Just received my CAT today. It's so surprisingly lightweight and compact that It'll go with me whenever I larp with a machete, axe, or chainsaw. Even if I lose a leg from restricted circulation I'll live to larp again as a peg legged pirate.
What do you think of a home brew combat pill pouch. 500mg Acetaminophen, 500mg ibuprofen, 509mg amoxicillin?
Calm down ranger Rick, the US hasn't seen combat in a decade now.
UL trannies are once again proving that they are fucking insufferably annoying
What sort of scenario do you foresee using that in?
Double the dose of Tylenol 
In general unless you're expecting to be multiple days away from competent medical care then you don't need antibiotics.
/k/ retards carrying like 5 lbs of shit for injuries that you'll never get doing a day hike or backpacking trip are worse.
Not an american
Even worse lmao
Take a step back and try to look from the outside. Let’s presuppose that both groups have zero real world experience. So where can they draw their opinions from?
The UL faggots can look at people who have done what they’re claiming to do. Thruhikers are a prime example. The Trek takes a survey of AT hikers every year, so there’s actual data. The hikers themselves provide literally thousands of anecdotes from plenty of different trails. UL trannies can also look at individuals with a lot of accomplishments. Andrew Skurka is brought up often. He’s done insane hikes, including thousands of miles of off-trail hiking, as well as leading groups of dumbass rich folks off trail (groups are more prone to injury). 
/k/ faggots don’t have that option, because anyone spending a lot of time outside will have the same opinion as the UL faggots.
these
There's your fundamental mistaken assumption. My med kit isn't just for me.
In the event where you resign to losing an entire limb and aren't carrying paracord, duct tape, a bandana, or a garment with sleeves
This distinction is what a lot of people forget in these threads. If it's a strictly personal med kit you probably aren't going to need much more than this >>2546471
But if you're designated medic for a group and especially if your job is outdoor emergency medicine you'll want stuff like shears, miscellaneous band aids, cravats, and what seems like way too much gauze
Idk it's some prepper geardo status thing I think
I keep a tq in my car and one on me but I'm a forester, I need a tq if I injure myself with a chainsaw
I've seen yanks boasting about how they take as many as 3 tqs out with them. I don't even know if they're joking
Sliding down a slope and getting stabbed by a muddy stick. 
It was something that was standard in my blow out kit. Asked the corpsman about it and he said it goes through different iterations as they learn more, but basically the idea was the ibuprofen and acetaminophen taken together eased the pain better than anything else and taking an internal anti-biotic was a fail safe. I know the corpsman carried morphine lollipops but I don’t think I’ll be getting my hands on those.
don't waste your money on anything not recommended by the CoTCCC
https://books.allogy.com/web/tenant/8/books/f94aad5b-78f3-42be-b3de-8e8d63343866/
this is true for things like sprains etc. I destroyed my ankle years ago, level 3 sprain and avulsion fracture, an ER doc friend of mine said the acetaminophen/ibuprofen or naproxen stack is nearly as effective as opiates for that kind of injury. but that's at the 4000mg acetaminophen and 1000mg of naproxen per 24hrs dosage
You're an absolute faggot and if you work in emergency medicine, I'd go out of my way to get your negligent cowboy ass fired.
The only thing not CoTCCC recommended that I would still put in a kit is a SWAT. The reason they don't recommend this is because it's hard to apply to your self, but it works well if it's not you strapping yourself up, and it can be used for several other things aside from being a TQ. (and it's cheap, so replacing it isn't painful).
You have to go back to the druggie thread
Pretty much what the goobers in this thread are advocating for, yeah. First aid is lost on the average hiker, I guess.
i have a small clear bottle i wrapped in tape to keep light out.
I bought a first aid kit off Amazon and threw in a tourniquet. It's got everything for what you could reasonably be expected to handle.
Post link.
It's not one of those $300 trauma bags is it?
Pull the ibuprofen from that stack. Generally not recommended for any time of trauma. Most NSAIDs cause issues with the clotting cascade.
I'll have to try that, thanks anon
combined medical / toiletries / sewing kit contains:
it fits nicely in a little 8x6x4" toiletries bag i had lying around. i keep hand sanitizer with my shitting supplies and usually camp with a nalgene full or whiskey. i could probably stash some water purification tablets "just in case," but i always prefer boiling the water
Gauze, bandaids, that one amazing aloe skin repair cream put in a tin, and antibacterial wipes.
I don't plan on getting shot or stabbed by a homeless man while in the middle of the Coloradan wilderness. I haven't heard of grizzlies up here either.
No grizzly. Black bear are pussies. There’s some pigmy rattlers in the hot spots. Warm and damp you’ll find some black widows. Mountain lion like all cats are ninja af, but if you can get a blow to their nose they’ll run away. Not many niggers. Spics know their place. Everyone outside of Denver and Boulder is packing. It’s a stand your ground and castle law state, so watch yourself with the crazy bitches.
nah its a 100 piece first aid bag, cost like $30 iirc.
Post link
It's always good practice when you come across unprepared hikers who
need aid
depends on what you're doing and how long. obviously if you're doing something like chopping firewood there is greater risk than during a short 20 mile hike.
day hike
a couple each small medium and large band aids
blister kit with tape and moleskin
super glue
snivel kit, allergy meds, diarrhea meds, laxatives, pain killers acetaminophen, NSAIDs, i had some opioids but im out now
bunch of alcohol wipes

larger quantities of everything above add
1x quick clot 1x trauma dressing
gauze
gloves
burn gel

tourniquet
Fucking yikes, anon. Saw accidents are nasty, knew a guy who took a saw to the face when it bucked up and wasn't wearing a face shield. Glad buddy made it out alive. Shit like this is why I wear chaps and have a trauma kit anyway when cutting.
wouldn't /k/ fags model it off of militaries?
My cowrker was a logger in Michigan. He was up a tree and forced his saw too hard. It slipped and opened up his inner thigh. You know that artery there? He was half an inch from knicking it. Would have bled out even with a properly done tourniquet with how long they had to drive him to get to help. It's the most dangerous job in America for a reason.
Yes, they would look at people who have been shot or blown up with bazookas and model their recreational outdoor first aid kits after that. It’s why they’re talking about tourniquets. 
Does that sound like a good idea?
This is what I carry hiking. The pink pills are bismuth subsalicylate (pepto-bismol) and the blue are ibuprofen. The tape is enough leuko tape for one ankle and 2-3 cut dressings. The circle thing is a silicone cock ring.
Check out this fag wasting grams on a silicone cock ring. Not very ultralight of you. 
The superior choice is to cinch part of the glove around your dick to act as a tourniquet, it's just as effective and significantly lighter.
dont use powder it'll give you some nasty bloodclots
use the impregnated bandages from quikclot
That's what I'm saying; I didn't think you could buy the powder form anymore. I remember hearing people complain about it "burning", but that was probably some whisper-down-the-line shit.
No, that was a real problem. The original formulation could reach 95C and cause full-thickness burns even when used as recommended. The issue was especially bad when used to pack deep wounds or covered by thick dressings and left to cook over a long evac flight.
Wasn't just the powder either. The sponge form would do the same.
They've changed the formulation now though and I'd assume you can't even buy the old stuff. 
The concerns around strokes/clots is a whole different issue.
Just use hemostatic gauze. You can get it off Amazon.
Hard pass

They both are for in case of the unheard happening. Frankly, I don't believe I ever need them, but if I do, they are there. For example if I happen to hit my knee with an axe at the commonly used wilderness cabins or I get shot by a hunter.
I keep this set*
For the love christ, buy your medical gear from a reputable dealer. Do not trust your life to bezomart.
What're the ingredients in that? Because to my knowledge there's not medication that's particularly useful for snake bites short of antivenom (which need to be refrigerated).
It contains hydrocortisone, it aims to ease out the bodys reaction as a mean of first aid so that you can get yourself to ER. It also works for wasp and bee stings. Luckily here in Finland the vipers aren't too dangerous though.
Do you guys actually go outside? Ever?
It's all so tiresome
if you need a tourniquet while /out/ you are pretty much dead already.
this is the ideal first aid kit
NGMI
Had me going until I saw cigs. Good one.
im not joking at all. cigs will save you in a life or death situation
I keep the israeli bandage in my left front leg pocket with my phone, figure if i ever need it i wont have time to walk to the equipment bag, usually gather the firewood a couple hundred yards away from my camp. Bad thing happens, put on the bandage, call for help, then figure out what to do next if you should move, make yourself more visible to rescue or just stay where you are applying pressure on top of the bandage.
Keep trying. You'll get somewhere eventually.
Either way the nurses and ER technicians will hate you for making them debride the qc. It still gets out of the bandages. 
But pissing off nurses is what I do best.

Bump. Interested in this.
What is a good lightweight container for first aid kits?
made me laugh
atleast he has $10 though
bro where tf you getting OTC Ondansetron? I want some, shits a life saver for hang overs
he's skimming it from a hospital.
Honestly how difficult is it to mcgyover a tourniquet from a shirt and a stick? Instead of $60 down the toilet? It's simple pressure, not open heart surgery. Light me up couch doctors.
It's $35, super lightweight, and even a retard can figure it out without instructions. Ultra fast to put on, even one handed. But if you think it's money down the drain, don't buy one. Don't ride with a helmet either, and don't bother packing rain gear 'cause it never rains. The wind will never tear at your tent, you'll never want water in the desert, and you'll never have an auto accident. Trust me bro.
kek
Difficult enough apparently. I'd buy a tourniquet rather than risk being one of the 67.6% of people who fail to improvise a functional tourniquet. 
See >>2545716
While the hospital employees study is bullshit because they used a mix (I assume a few cafeteria workers, admin jockeys and custodians got in there), it's still concerning that so few could improv a TQ before they had their hands held. Our medical system really is shit.
I know I said even a retard could put it on but you'll be the exception.
improvised tq fails in the overwhelming majority of cases. You don't have time to "macgyover" one when there is a femoral injury. It is better if you don't have a tq to pack the wound with a clean cloth or hemostatic gauze. You should carry a real tq hunting or shooting. Otherwise it is unnecessary because you are unlikely to experience femoral trauma except with a gunshot wound. A space blanket is 10x more likely to save your life than a tq
Thanks for making this thread bro, made me realise my antiseptic had leaked. 
I only have 1 med kit which I take with me everywhere but it does what I need it to
Contains:
and as many bandaids as I can fit.
When going camping I typically stick the Micropur and Hydralyte in there too.
Have made use of everything at least once except for the shock blanket, triangular bandage and surgical gloves. 
Also been meaning to get some snake bandages but just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Any recommendations bros? Also what the fuck is an "Israeli bandage"?
Israeli bandage is a compression wrap with a sewn on dressing and a pressure applicator bar built into the wrap. It is like a snakebite/ace bandage but can be self administered one handed and apply pinpoint pressure to control a venous hemorrhage. You should buy a "T3" style Israeli bandage because it includes a detachable secondary dressing and important wound packing gauze that can even be used stop an arterial hemorrhage (massive hemorrhage) for around the same weight and bulk as the non-t3 (old) style ones.
Bring medical tape so you can tape an ankle or make a splint. Leuko tape works best and can be used to prevent blisters.
Australian, I assume? Pretty sure pressure bandages aren't recommended elsewhere in the world.
This guy is an idiot
It’s one thing to be a larper and bring a trama kit without having anything bandaids. But bringing something to stop serious bleeding while doing any sort of extreme sport is different. Yeah it might not happen and you have never experienced it but this stuff does happen and when it does you will wish you had something besides your shirt
The last time I personally saw an actual firefight was 2019 in Syria. I know Green Berets and Rangers who've killed people in the last year. Combat is more sporadic now, yes, but it still manages to happen occasionally. Unless you're a Marine or something, then you're literally not deploying to do fuck-all.
I carry literally the exact same thing, were you a medic?
Yeup. Honestly not too worried about snakes, my typical camping buddies are herpers, but it's good to always be prepared
Cheers mate
Do you bring a satellite phone along with the tourniquet? Because if you have to use it on a limb but you're 50km+ away from any busy roads or phone reception, aren't you pretty much fucked anyway?
Anyone grow their own medicine? Found a how to guide in this book my mom ordered me for Christmas and I was wondering if anyone’s tried it out before

Why do /out/istics hate hammocks? I prefer hammocks to tents so long as it's more than 0C desu. Especially on multiday hikes
we hate everything, m8. i'm also aware of the fact that my preferences are not only the best way, but also the only acceptable one.
There are a few reasons.
Europeans
There are no hammock manufacturers on that entire continent that make decent products appropriately sized for an adult man. Also hammocks are impossible to hide in a small patch of bushes on a private farm road 3km from town, which is the most common type of European “hiking.”
autistics
The concept of the exception isn’t easily understood by people with severe autism (aka the majority of /out). That’s where the comments about deserts and being above tree line come in. Having the inability to understand the basic mindset of others, they fail to grasp that we know about the exceptions.
The military and YouTube survivalists haven’t really adopted hammocks as a go-to shelter just yet. Until they do, /out/ and /k/ will continue to suggest using bivies.
There are a minority of people who once strung a 9’ AliExpress hammock banjo string tight, couldn’t sleep in it, and decided it’s not for them.
My back doesn't like being shaped like a banana for 8 hours
Restricted to areas with trees a certain distance apart, and this puts you in areas with other hammock enjoyers, or so far out away that it interferes with other plans
Dealing with tying certain knots is not bad after a long day out, but untying in the morning is annoying. 
Last outing was with friends, 3 with tents, 1 with hammock, tent guys had to compromise our spots to be near certain trees with that certain distance apart. It's just unnecessary when a foam pad + inflatable weigh the same as a hammock, netting, and cord
Damn, I forgot to add actual retards like >>2560636 to the list.
banana
No
knots
Lol
LMAO!
no thanks boss.
i live in Norway so can't speak to the lack of right to roam in the rest of the continent, but they sell plenty of good hammocks here, including Hennessey. But hell even the cheaper stuff gets the job done 
The rest sounds about right though. 
Skill issue. If you set it up right you can sleep straight or even on your side no problem. And finding a good tent spot is way harder than a good hammock spot. But yeah when with friends it's ofc better to tent together in large tents
Cheap hammocks are rarely over 10’ long. I’m 6’ 1”, the appropriate height for an adult man. If a hammock is less than 11’ long my feet hang off the end.
Huh, wonder on which continet I've been hiking, then.
Pic related being from a nature reserve up north I visted and hiked in last summer. 80kms in 3 days walking up and down multiple fells and ridges.
I do use hammocks in the south, in the north there are no trees to hang anything from.
Nobody said anything about getting a gf
I'm 6'4. Some are a bit small but it's not hard to find a big one. And even with a small one, who cares if your feet are off the edge? You're in a sleeping bag and wearing wool socks most of the time anyway. Worst case, put a pillow or some clothes under your knees and it's fine
who cares
I care. 
sleeping bag in a hammock
No
Bro, do you even hike?
It’s only an issue when I’m stretching out and relaxing in the afternoon or in the morning. When I sleep I end up curled up on my side. It actually works out well because I can use a 3/4 length underquilt.
Dull arguments
The sad fact is that Americans pay $200 for a sheet of nylon.
Order 350x160 sheet of 70D nylon for $25. Fold in and overhand knot the ends. Tie loops to the ends. Attach straps to the loops with carabiners. Have yourself a hammock. Made me sell the Warbonnets again.
Nylon straps and carabiners. Not only is it much, much, much easier to deal with it's also much kinder to the trees. Also makes for a simple way to vary the length of your hang.
Like a baby. Chads sleep on their backs
$200
Imagine being so poor you think that’s a lot of money. Anyway, hammocks from cottage manufacturers are closer to $50. 
just make one
Europeans can’t into DIY. It’s very strange, considering the lack of cottage manufacturers.
out of 70D
Damn, and I thought Americans were fat
just tie the ends
Anon, while I admire your willingness to tell people to do things that you would never bother doing, this isn’t necessarily good advice. Without hemming the sides, there’s a good chance it will tear.
TBDesu, if you have access to a sewing machine, even one you don’t own, a hammock is the easiest DIY thing you can sew. It’s all straight lines on a rectangle of fabric. 
Is that right? Is it a nominal measurement? Nearly all ripstop nylon in the US is 60” wide (152cm), though I know there’s some 2.2oz, 70d that’s like 74”/188cm. Maybe 160cm is including selvage?
Somethings off with your brain. Better get it checked out.
This is nonsense. The thing is more that you can get a reasonable chinesium hammock for much less than the materials and time of making one (at the low end) or you can just buy a pretty decent one from a manufacturer if you have a job.
I will agree that some other kinds of DIY are less common here, but that's usually because the space to have a woodshop in your home is extortionately expensive.
Elaborate on this for me please. Bivy camper with a bad back thinking about making the switch but this seems like a sound argument.
Get a reasonable tautness
Lie at a 45deg angle to the ridgeline for more straightness
Sleep on your side
You do have to hammock right, just like anything /out/.
With a properly hung hammock, you don’t sleep in a banana shape. You let the hammock sag, and sleep diagonally across it. The hammock opens up, and you lie nearly flat. Most people sleep on their sides in a hammock, and I’ve met a few old folks who legitimately couldn’t sleep on the ground because of various old folk issues. Hammocks allowed them to camp. 
Here’s a Shug video.

Take the sock pill anon, you won't regret it. They have to be fresh socks ofc
one of these things doesn't belong
heat holders socks might sound like a meme but they are so comfy because they are warm and loose on the feet but stay on
I guess if I lived in a really cold environment I’d probably be on board. The foot box on my quilt has been plenty enough down to the mid 20’s. If it gets colder than that I can just wait till the next weekend and it will be 30° warmer because it’s the South and the weather is retarded.
European here, you can easily hide a hammock near a very frequented trail and be unedetected. Of course, you have to not be a big retard and not sleep right next to the road, or at eye level. 3/4 of the height of a tree is often the best if you manage to climb, and it keeps you an your stuff away from other humans and the occasional boar.
What is it with all these boomers online saying that hammocks fix their back problems. I'm tall and have lower back problems and every time I've woken up in a hammock my lower back has been sore. I use the warbonnet blackbird which is supposedly the most comfortable hammock on the market
Can't imagine they're viable for anyone bringing a friend. These days I go camping with my wife and when I was at uni inviting a girl out was my go-to way of getting in her pants. Hammocks would kill that, no?
No.
Tents are too comfy, fuck hammocks
Why would I want to be zipped into a small sack that is tied to some trees? In a tent I can cook on my stove, read a book, lay down, and do 50 fuckin pushups. Weight of tent: 4.6 pounds
I can’t cook or do pushups under an 11x9 tarp
Lol
Are you ok?
Tents are much better than hammocks for many reasons, that is what I said.
Can wank in them
You implied that tents are better without giving any actual reasons. And I don’t think you can do 50 consecutive push-ups.
The biggest issues will be underquilts and tarps, not the hammock body.
I built a hammock stand for my bedroom, sleeping in it every night has cured my back pain.
I prefer a tent for many reasons
the list goes on..
nah, that would be the haven tent hammock.
Breh what? Why not? 
Keep a big warm pair in your bag a d only wear it for sleeping. Game changer in the winter
My hammock, I am up high because the river has salmon and brown bears. At night I hear all kinds of spooky shit outside and I feel like a burrito. But if the "animal" tries to get you the hammock spins around like youtube related making you almost impossible for you to eat. But they spin you around so much it's hard to get out, took me about a half hour once.

Most people are not creatures of reason
Burrito, the ultimate defense.
My area's trees (which are often closer to shrubs) are not suitable for hammocks. I usually go for a bivvy. Given how dry it is here condensation is not really a problem.
The military has to take into account the issue of stealth which most hikers do not care about.
He must be a spic. I feel more like a soba sandwich.
I used to keep a fire going but it didn't help.
salmon
Wrong
brown bears

muh weather
Wrong
empty my pack out
Why can’t you do that with a hammock?
wut? See pic and explain why it’s so complicated.
Emptying out your backpack in your hammock sounds like a terrible idea
homemade woolsocks all the time
AMATEUR HOUR!!!
What kind of pussy ass faggot raccoons do they have there?
What kind of pussy ass faggoy tents do you have?
Do that when it's pouring down rain. Oh, do you only camp in the sunshine?
can’t sit in a hammock in the rain 
wut?
can’t put things under a tarp in the rain
wut?
wit?
Use your words
Local anon cannot fathom tarp camping.
Eh anything soft can go into the hammock, typically carry some foam mat for sitting which makes a good floor and a backup for ground camping if the area is unknown.
Please take your waxed canvas 18th century LARP gear back to /cgl/
Fuck you, didnt even give me a chance to say it myself.
For the record, i was going to say
But youre too good to play along, i guess.
This board is so damn Americanized
Guys, I also have hammocks but you definitely have more space to move gear around in a tent.
And thats a good thing
I use hammocks because there are woods everywhere and unlike you idiots I actualy know how to sleep in one without feeling the discomfort you faggots are talking about.
no
Yes
Yes
yeah fucker right you guys are the worst and you should stick to watching tv
would write more but it would be too long
I thought Europeans were smart.
Can you give an approximate location of those places please?
Wtf is this GPT-4chan bullshit?
Site-wide April Fools joke.
Don't forget how he wanted everyone to eat MREs 
What a fucking faggot
I've fallen down the hammock rabbit hole. Want to do some m/o/torcycle camping this summer and found hammocks to be the best setup. I have bought:
underquilt
but then I realized I still need a shitton of other things now, like
topquilt
but then I realized I still need a shitton of other things now, like
hammock
but then I realized I still need a shitton of other things now, like
suspension
but then I realized I still need a shitton of other things now, like
tarp
but then I realized I still need a shitton of other things now, like
this is getting ridiculous. I bet I'm still missing more stuff...
There are no hammock manufacturers on that entire continent that make decent products appropriately sized for an adult man.
Poles do a pretty good job. Lesovik Draka - 330 × 150 cm. FlyHamak Ursa - 350 cm x 185 cm.
Haven't used fancy wasps, but simple 2$ nama-claws from Aliexpress work fine for me (pic related). Attaching tarp ridgeline to a tree with a carabiner on one side, claw on the other side - and tarp itself to the ridgeline using two more claws. Way cheaper than any fancy hammock-specific thingies.
You do t neet a separate ridge line, as most tarps have a sewn ridge. Wasps or something similar are a good idea though. Every setup needs stakes; if you’re sleeping outside, that’s pretty much a given. I never understood the point of fleaz. Shok cord and pole mods are just a luxury.
Just get 50ft of zing it or similar. 15ft on either side of the tarp. 5ft for the other 4 (assuming 4) points. Cheap Y aluminum stakes on Amazon work pretty good, some sets come with shitty cordage but they also have the metal tensioners which saves you from tying knots for the stakes. Truckers hitch and two-half hitches for the Ridgeline, bobs your uncle. The fancy hardware is cool but it's not required.
Ask me how i know you only hike in the east where you cant even get above timberline
You know, for as good as the west coast supposedly is, you sure spend a lot of time talking about the east coast.
Alright, I went with continuous ridgeline with wasp and Nama claws, and Nana claws for the stakes
Aw shoots I ordered before I saw this reply. I went with MSR groundhogs since I didn't know what to get and will pair it with lots of zing it rope which I will cut to length and throw Nama claws onto
Here's what I bought online over the past few days:
Sucks how weak the Canadian dollar is. Americans don't know how good they have it... This was like $1k but whatever, buy once cry once! I'll try to go out in late April and hit up some hotsprings while motorcycling around BC
You are terrible at shopping
I tried to do my research :/
Did this "research" involve reading (totally not sponsores) how to guides, reviews, and articles?
No, I tried my best to sift through shit and read actual, honest accounts on vBulletin forums from people with no agenda
actual, honest accounts on vBulletin
lol
from people with no agenda
LMAO
anon i feel sorry for you, but i dont want you to feel bad. This is a learning experience.
An important questions to ask YOURSELF when researching things like this is
how did people do it before all these name brand products existed
The answer is almost always
Sans the actual hammock ofcourse.
I went to my local hardware store and maybe things are different where you live but my selection was essentially bargain bin dollarstore quality-tier, and was quite limited. I have to go the online route. I hope and pray the hammock will work for me
Okay? Do you weigh 600 pounds or something?
Our hammocks are more advanced, bigger and, more comfortable, you're not paying for the same thing
Never understood this meme, /out/ is the most well adjusted, sanest most positive board on 4chinz
i used to like them till i fucked my back up, now i can't really fall asleep in them.
hammockfags seem to have the highest rate of people who make their own gear and america's the main place with all the companies making hammocks that aren't mass produced.
i don't know modern hammock gear but i don't think you fucked up. the quilts are the most expensive part and as long as you did the 'custom' parts correct (sizing, comfort rating, etc) hg econs are pretty much the standard first 'serious' quilt everyone buys, great price -> performance ratio. at least in america i don't know how your looney tooney fag money affects things. i used to have one it was great and i'm pretty sure my ex whore's still using it, i upgraded to 950 fill bags. 
anon if you're seriously suggesting anon camp under a hardware store tarp... just stop retard. its not even cheaper than buying a real tarp. they leak the first few times you use them. i do residential construction i use those things all the time they're pieces of shit and meant to be thrown away after 1 use on a job site they're not camping gear. 
in a turn of events you are the vBulletin retard
$20 hardware store tarp
vs
leaks after 4 uses
vs
only cheaper if you don't go outside
Dutchware is rarely mentioned outside of people who actually use it. It’s pretty typical for cottage manufacturers. And that’s not that much “stuff,” it’s just a complete hammock setup. 
Does the Chameleon come with a structural ridge line?
picrel i only post opinions on gear i have really used
unlike this hardware store everbilt tarp larper
You do realize they sell higher line tarps right next to the cheap ones, right?
those aren't high end tarps just because they're expensive. those are made out of woven plastic https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Tarps/ anon doesn't need a 80 dollar woven plastic tarp. we're going camping not covering up lumber for the winter, je-sus. anon can wait a week for a real backpacking tarp to show up in the mail from a specialty company.
I wish you were trolling
Looks good. If you're new to hammock get out to the woods during the day to fiddle and practice. Dutchware are good people if you have questions via hammockforum.
Most do with the bug nets. If not, easy to add and they bought extra cordage.
It's 2023 pops, only bushcrafters use waxed canvas.
i know you're not trolling because i've seen you try to recommend hardware store tarps before... and if you waste your life on such asinine trolls on the slowest board on 4chan... yowza
in what world does it make sense to camp under a hardware store tarp?
have you ever used one before?
they're not completely water tight and they pinhole from very light use outside.
why would you waste $20 on some one time disposable bullshit that's a liability and doesn't even do its job?
jewgle search
"silpoly 9x9 tarp"
first result
68 dollars for a tarp that'll last decades
even cheaper if you make it yourself 
ripstop by the roll dot com or whatever
fucks sake this is not difficult. stop recommending hardware store tarps to newfags.
silpoly... silnylon... any fabric coated in polyurethane... waxed canvas... coarse wool without its lanolin removed.. fuck i don't know you have a lot of acceptable options whether you want to go with modern camping gear or ren faire. 
using a hardware store tarp made out of plastic with a weave that loose, you may as well go back to wearing a banana leaf skirt you nigger.
i know you're not trolling because i've seen you try to recommend hardware store tarps before...
No, you havent, because i havent.
in what world does it make sense to camp under a hardware store tarp?
The one where youre not forced to buy the cheapest tarp?
Well maybe more people should.
Wait until you figure out you can buy the aforementioned style tarps from a hardware store...
Opinion discarded. Blue tarps are an acceptable option for someone just getting into /out. They don't cost much and they work fine as long as you aren't camping in heavy rain.
Blue tarps are an acceptable option for someone just getting into /out.
only for learning how to pitch a tarp at the park or in their back yard.
that's it.
its a waste of $20.
that's 1/2 the cost of making a real tarp and 1/3 the cost of just buying one someone else made.
good high quality tarps are very cheap. you're thinking with short time preference like a nigger trying to nickel and time, when really you are just telling people to waste their money on crap that will wind up in a landfill. 
they work fine as long as you aren't camping in heavy rain.
what
the fuck
do you think a tarp
is for
you mouth breathing fucking moron
if the weather is so fair that it doesn't matter that your tarp is leaking like a sieve you can just cowboy camp, you don' even need a tarp. moderate climate faggot. 
what now nigger
and fuck even if you are talking about saving money
you can get a 30d silpoly tarp for 17 dollars on aliexpress
that's cheaper than a blue tarp at my local home depot 
neither one is a 'standard' 9x9 they're both narrow. but point is, its not even cheaper, its just the wrong kind of tarp. why the fuck would an anon going hiking pay $20 for a $5 blue tarp marked up because contractors have no other choice but to buy whats closest?
Nta but you do know that plastic weave tarps dont just turn into screens when they leak, right?
just spend two to three times as much on something you're only trying out
okay
there's no such thing as light to moderate rain
okay
kek
I've actually never looked at aliexpress until today. It looks like what you'd get if amazon and a scam site had a mutated lovechild. Is that where people go to get sweatshop merch and also have their identity stolen?
Yes, once someone mentions alibaba its good practice to disregard anything they said previously as shilling.
you stupid nigger i build houses, im a general contractor, i buy tens maybe even hundreds of hardware store tarps a year.
they're not high quality tarps.
they're pieces of shit.
you didn't find some money saving lifehack.
hardware store tarps are made of the lowest grade recycled plastics and they're built for two purposes:
- being the cheapest to produce object you could possibly legally describe as a tarp
- getting marked up to $20 because home depot has a monopoly and they have you by the balls knowing you're losing money every minute you spend in their store. $60 of piece of shit tarps? haha just scan the card!!!
you aren't some gigagenius that found one trick that the outdoors industry hates. there's no grand conspiracy to stop you from buying a sheet of silpoly for $7.50 a foot off the first result on google and learning how to sew a rectangle tarp. 
that's how you actually save money. used sewing machine might cost a few more dollars than buying the tarp pre made but then you can make your own gear.
okay
...the good ones?
Exactly retard...
aliexpress is chink amazon, but chinks don't use it, its their western facing market for foreigners.
its parent site alibaba is where most of the local businesses in your city get all the stuff they sell you, and where most of the stuff you buy on amazon comes from. almost everything you see on amazon and a lot of ebay = someone in america mass bought [object] on alibaba, put it in a warehouse in your country, and charge you a premium for the logistics. its called drop shipping.
the good ones cost more than buying a 9x9 silpoly tarp from borah
do you know what the 'good' tarps cost at home depot?
okay
stupid fucking water head nigger
do you not read you monkey ape?
Good thing I don't buy from Amazon, then. I either order directly from the manufacturer or get stuff secondhand.
said the coin clipper who's told multiple anons to buy a hardware store tarp
No, i told you to buy a good tarp. You seem to think hardware stores only stock shitty plastic weave tarps.
Someone's mad this morning. Foreman riding your ass or something?
oh, you're probably really familiar with taobao alibaba etc then. aliexpress is just alibaba trying to compete with amazon and ebay. its cheaper to handle your own logistics if you know how to, when buying direct. aliexpress is essentially just a service that handles the international logistics, holds your payment in escrow until you receive the product and release it, and gives you buyer protection in exchange for a fee. if you know how to navigate international logistics or hire an agent its not worth the cost except on small items.
what the fuck are you mumbling about retard????
i linked you every single tarp home depot sells in store and mail order. they are all made of woven PE or HDPE. the "good" tarps are just tighter but still comically loose for this application weaves and thicker plastic. 
go to home depot dot com and type tarp
why would you waste money on a hardware store tarp? if you're broke just get a borah https://borahgear.com/tarps.html
68 dollars
good tarp
all you need for life
beginner expert i don't give a fuck its a 9x9 silpoly tarp
five minute crafts lifehack pajeet retard
See >>2563137
here i even did the math for you retard
it costs 34 dollars for the silpoly to make that tarp
plus the loops and thread and shit
wow such a massive mark up for a hand made mitusa product from a small business!!
these tarp makers are really ripping us off guise!!!1!1!1one!1
see: you're retarded
clueless clown
Okay, now check the other dozen hardware stores everyone has within driving distance.
You really are that kinda guy, huh...
anon... you know what a monopoly is?
...do you? I have 4 hardware stores, none of which are lowes or home depot, and only one of which is a chain (with only 6 locations), in my little town of 8000 people. I get it my car? Its over.
Youre a drooling schizophrenic, seek help.
you sound like a woman
L delivered, thanks for playing.
anon
read back
do you think there's a single anon who will read your posts, read my posts, and come to the conclusion you have a single clue or fuck what you're talking about?
you're the age of a child and have to think about stuff like using hardware store tarps because you're not a man yet. your mom and dad don't give you enough money. i'll see you in the next bug out bag or running away from home thread. your type only exists to be made fun of. you don't know anything about the outdoors. you don't belong on this board. you're a depressed incel kid who should be on /adv/ asking how to fill out job applications or /diy/ learning a skill. 70 dollars for a piece of gear that lasts for decades isn't a lot for a grown adult. that's actually about as cheap as backpacking shelters get.
we get it your entire experience with the outdoors is living in some moderate climate where you can cowboy camp 300 days of the year and be fine.
you didn't even ask anon where he lives.
dude if you tell some anon to camp in a home depot tent and he lives in... canada... norway... pnw.. which are places lots of anons on this board live, that can get dangerous fast, more of the year than you'd think if you've never been to a part of the planet that actually has seasons and incliment weather. 
the idea of someone camping in that kind of tarp where i live except maybe at the neighborhood park in the summer is

i'm a general contractor anon. i drive all around my region doing jobs. hate to break it to you but home depot killed everything else. if you still got a local hardware store give them business 'cause they might not be around.
Theyre not going anywhere, for some reason home depot and lowes just never moved into town.
actually most of the homeless here have like $2-300 tents
i know rei gives a lot of them out
good
fuck home depot
lowes isn't a real hardware store i consider it a "diy" store with a decent gardening section
Well this devolved into a regarded argument, probably by just one guy, but who knows. The world is filled with retards.
blue tarp
Lol
Lmao
i don't even live that far north anon, and my weather forecast was supposed to be clear skies
haha do you know what weather forecast means up north?
clear day one minute. next its sideways hail. then 6 inches of snow. then icy rain. then it was sunny and 60 degrees out. all in the afternoon. 
you can't just assume everyone lives in a moderate climate
I’d pass on a 9x9 square. 
Square tarps are usually hung as a diamond, which is less than ideal. 9x9 gives you 12.7’ as a diamond, which leaves 1.5’ of coverage over an 11’ hammock hung at 30°. So I mean sure, it technically fits.
The problem is wind and minimal rain cover. The sides are much more exposed to wind, and rain on an angle could more easily reach the hammock near the head and foot. 
It could be hung asymmetrically, but it really depends on the tie out location. That will mitigate the risk from rain, but not really solve the wind problem. 
There’s also the fact that it’s got flat 9’ edges. It takes some practice to get them perfectly pitched, whereas catenary cuts are much more forgiving. 
I’m pretty sure someone (maybe Dutchware, possibly Warbonnet) was making tarps specifically with an asymmetric design. It was more similar to a hex tarp rather than a square or rectangle hung as a diamond. Dutchware definitely has asyms that are like diamonds with cat cut edges. 
I don’t think they ever really caught on, and hex cat cut seems to be the most common. It makes sense; it’s the easiest to pitch, offers more reasonable coverage, and can easily be made with doors.
Life must be hard for you
this is a homeless encampment in portland oregon
lol wut
even the crack fiends can afford a better shelter
holy kek
Anon you know damn well they didnt buy that...
Borah will probably cut a larger one for the associated costs. Simply Light will too. Paria outdoors has a cheaper silnylon one and there's a few on Amazon like aquaquest which aren't bad. Alibaba and a privacy card works though.
Oh now it's cheap again. I thought it was the nice home Depot tarp?
Anon, I won't call you a schizo, but I will remind you that there are multiple people participating in this thread.
See >>2563158
Oh no I just can't follow the blue tarp autism is all. Ruined what turned out to be a decent thread. 
Might fuck around with a 12ft hammock, will this give additional sag for comfort or will I just be drowning in fabric?
Stay mad
Hammocks are good. Takes some trial and error to hang and use one right for your own comfort though. People already mentioned laying diagonally but that's probably the biggest first timers mistake. otherwise once you got it down its some of the most comfy sleep you can get. 
Also regarding tarps, you can use a good one, you can use a home made one, or you can use a cheap one and patch it if holes pop up. I've had cheap flimsy tarps outlast thick double later stuff sometimes.
Anon, I won't call you a schizo
you really think the guy telling people to buy a hardware store tarp doesn't suffer from mental illness?
come on now...
heroin addicts have their life together more than that.
what kind of dumb ass post is this?
of course i know what alibaba is i own a small business
you've been getting clowned on by at least 3 or 4 anons for going on 24 hours now
i haven't posted in hours, i was working, trust me i'm not the only anon making fun of you
OP hooked some good ones in this thread, kek
Sorry chief but you're about an inch shy of man height.
5'11" master race
the guy who's been recommending blue tarps for months isn't "baiting"
Is this "the guy" in the room with us right now?
It’s not so much additional sag as it is additional width. It’s somewhat counterintuitive, but a wider hammock results in unusable fabric. My Eno Doublenest has more floppy fabric on either side than any of my 12’ hammocks.
Is setting up a one person hammock faster and easier than a one person tent?
i can pitch my cloudup 2 in a few minutes, staked out and everything. if a hammock is faster it cant by any significant amount
If you're a retard who can't into knots, it might take awhile. Otherwise, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
You sound like a faggot. What kind of loser brings MREs to eat while /out/ and gets mad that no one wants to roleplay with you and eat a shitty fucking MRE.
Probably a military reject
Do I need to add and remove the bugnet for each setup/takedown? What about bags which hang off the ridgeline? Do those get left in place and packed together or fully deconstructed each time?
Not really. A hammock is faster in the sense that it takes a little less time to hang a tarp, which is really nice when it’s raining, but it’s really splitting hairs. Plus it takes some practice to know how high you want everything, how tight you want your ridge line, where your hammock ends should sit relative to your tarp, etc. 
Tents are easier in the sense that anyone can figure it out and do it pretty quickly. For instance if we swapped, and I set up your tent while you set up my hammock, I’ll be done way before you because setting up moat tents doesn’t take much know how. But it would take you a bit to get my hammock right. You’d sit in it and decide it’s too low. You’d lay in it and decide the head end was too high. You’d realize it’s not centered under the tarp. And so on. 
Attached bug nets stay attached; some are seen to the hammock on one side with a zipper entrance in the other. If you have a net that slips over the hammock, you can leave it on if your stuff sack is large enough to accommodated both. The bags I hang from my ridge line are bags that are used for other things (suspension, hammock double ended stuff sack), but taking them off is easy. It’s just a simple larks head, passing the bag through its own cinch cord and around the ridge line. If you have a dedicated bag for your ridge line, you can leave it on when you pack everything up.
If you really want to save the hassle of setting up and taking down, you can get a really large snake skin that covers literally everything; quilts, hammock, bug net, pillow, the clothes you accidentally left in there… They look really convenient but they never caught on.
Thanks, you have addressed all my concerns! I can imagine it'll take some practice to get the angles right for my hammock structural ridgeline.
How many times did everyone clap during this?
p much this desu.
/thread
Hammock don’t work above tree line. Hammocks suck at tree line where the trees are small and far apart where there are bushes in between said trees that are hammock height. Hammock don’t work well in proper old growth Forrest’s (PNW of North America) where the tree circumferences are massive (12’-18’) and each tree is 45’ apart. Hammocks require the same amount or more (hammock, under quilt/sleeping pad, tarp, sleeping bag, tree straps &amp; suspension) gear than traditional sleeping systems. They’re also finicky to set up to get a flat lay. Sometimes at the end of a long day the last thing I want to do is fiddle with my whoopie slings until everything is perfect. 
I fell for it for the hammock meme for a minute. They’re nice to hang &amp; chill in for an afternoon. But a simple tarp set up on the ground is more versatile &amp; faster overall.
Forgot to mention deserts, steppe, savanna, prairies and all of the other environments that they equally don’t work in
Shoot I am in the PNW and hope I don't struggle in campgrounds. Thankfully I'll be using snakeskins to unfurl the tarp quickly and a strap system so I don't need to fiddle with knots.
Jet skis suck because you need water to ride them.
Based, love hammocks simple as
wind not rain. hardware store tarps rip very easily in even moderate wind gusts.
the worst part about gearfag threads are all the no-experience and also poor niggers who infest these things no matter what the niche or hobby is, posting their opinions and recommendations about things they've never used, only existing as a pitfall for beginners and someone to be filtered out as white noise by everyone else.
Based, stay in your rock gardens.
okay
Grew up south of the Mason Dixon and east of the Mississippi. You can have it.
telling an anon who's obviously not poor and dropped $1000 to try out hammocking to buy landfill waste
yes i do think a lot of anons sit on here and post opinions all day about gear they've never used. 
everyone knows that. its common knowledge for anyone who's used one.
Called it. See:>>2560632
i don't understand why its so hard for anons to grasp "not everyone lives in the same place on a international message board" or at the very least ask who they're replying to before automatically making assumptions.
i live in washington, which for those of you who don't know, my entire state consists of nothing but 'exception' situations where hammocks suck dick. washington = old growth forests, tall mountains, and desert.
if i based my opinion on hammocks based on solely my experience living in washington i'd thing they're the most useless piece of shit shelters ever.
do i sit on outdoor forums shitting on hammocks? no, but a lot of tards on this board seem to have that mentality. not that hard to grasp that if i were to live in a different part of the world hammocks would be pretty sweet. i also benefit a lot from hammockfags existing as someone who ground sleeps in a quilt a lot of the time &amp; uses a tarp shelter. thanks for making all that kind of gear widely and cheaply available hammock bros!
lmao
an anon that I made up
the blue tarp was originally brought up when an anon who posted a $1000 list of gear asked if he fucked up or bought decent hammocking gear.
read the thread idiot.
i use hardware store tarps at work.
no it is not
spending $60 to $80 on a good tarp is what a beginner should do.
not wasting $15-30 on something that will leak after the first storm it sees.
if you want a $30 tarp buy a military surplus one.
the only value it has to a beginner is to learn basic pitches and to test out if tarp camping is for them.
if you really can't afford a silpoly tarp just buy a military surplus one lightly damaged for $20.
great opportunity for a beginner to learn how to repair their tarp before it happens in the field where you need the tarp.
if you havent figured it out already most of /out/ doesn't ever go /out/. if they do it's more homeless larping than hiking.
hammocks + a tarp are the way to go when hiking. car camping is whatever bring your giant ass air conditioned 30lb tent.
Yeah, generally whenever I see someone say "hey here's this thing" and anons come out of the woodwork to sperg about how terrible it is, I assume it's just fine. Simple hammock, cheap tarp, I stay comfortable and dry no matter how much anons seethe.
Yeah, generally whenever I see someone say 
generally if you're inexperienced its best to lurk and listen to the opinions of people who know more than you until you have more, instead of shitting up the board by posting your opinion on gear you've never used. think and use your brain before posting. "what value does my opinion have, if i've never tried it?" this is generally good life advice not just for /out/ and if more people followed it less beginners would be given bad advice.

cheap tarps are fine.
you're misunderstanding or strawmanning.
that's not what i'm saying.
there is a large variety of kinds of cheap tarps that exist, made of different materials.
woven PET tarps are the worst kind you can possibly choose for camping.
the very thick 10-15mm ones are acceptable for car camping but not actual camping.
you can get different kinds of tarps that are way better, and equally cheap.
you're not arguing cheap vs expensive tarp
you're arguing to buy a shittier tarp at a brick and mortar hardware store for the same price, or usually MORE expensive than buying a better cheap tarp online from a surplus place or small american/european manufacturer.
hardware store tarps are not cheap either
the 3mm and 5mm tarps can be considered cheap tarps, those are the ones that leak in a stiff breeze.
the thick ones cost more than buying a proper backpacking tarp. they're not cheaper. they're both more expensive, less durable, less water resistant, heavier, bulkier, worse by every metric at that point because they're meant to be cheap mass produced covers for lumber and job sites. most of them have snap rings in them. if you know anything about tarps it weakens the material because you're cutting a circle into it. fucking 17-25 year old zoomer retards.
are you samefagging?
i have a hard time believing even /out/ is a shit enough board to have more than 1 anon who thinks a hardware store tarp is a goog idea
I will continue to use a ten dollar blue tarp, it will continue to work fine, I'll continue to suggest it to newbies, and there's nothing you can do about it
It's mostly just a couple of assholes who really hate it when other anons enjoy something; they seem to think they can actually gatekeep this shit by raging on a peruvian clogging forum
we get it you live somewhere without weather
Nobody askes
Heh, nothing personel
No you dont. Because if you did, you wouldnt think they rip at the slightest gust of wind.
Alternatively you are just a retard and cause them to rip often by mishandling them.
I did hammocks for a while and found few use cases.
So straight away if you're dealing with adverse conditions you're looking at a hammock plus a tarp/hex, ground mat, drip line, bag hanger, hanging hooks, fly net etc etc. 
At that point your hammock is now heavier than a regular ass backpacking tent. Some people may prefer them but I wouldn't recommend it. 
I found only thee use cases. 
A. Ultralight in fair weather.
B. Snow when you've got trees
C. Swamps/jungle
I would absolutely unrecomend camping in malarial jungle or a swap, 0/10, highly unadvisable. No. But in this situation you've probably got no clear flat ground, too much rain, horrible poisonous insects, no need for a sleeping bag. 
Snow is interesting and I hadn't done it myself but apparently the main advantage is that the air under the hammock acts as a cold sink, you keep a sleeping bag dry inside the hammock and wrap a second sleeping bag over the hammock, and not needing to cut into the snow so much you're less likely to be buried alive. Can't confirm.
Says
 I did hammocks for a while
Immediately outs himself as a liar or an abject retard by saying
nowhere to store gear
consider typing drip knots
nowhere to work
consider typing drip knots
water runs down ropes
consider typing drip knots
use underquilt, it is just like using a sleeping bag in a tent
It’s basic shit like this that puts people as liars or retards. Anyone setting up a hammock knows you need some kind of water break (like hardware that 90% of people are already using) or to tie drip lines. He also said he used rope to hang a hammock. Who uses rope and not poly straps? People who did no research at all and just went in blind (retards), or didn’t actual do it and are just making shut up (liars).
nta but I bought a hammock recently and it came with rope. Consider that not everyone has your supposed experience with hammocks, and not everyone does research to determine what parts of a product should be immediately replaced.
that's certainly true, but they certainly should.
Turns out cheap gear is crap. Who would have known?
This. I used an everbilt tarp for a while when I first started going /out/, got me by just fine. Now I have an aquaquest and use the blue tarp for yardwork.
Basketball isn’t a real sport because you have to have some kind of hoop to play. Football is a real sport because you can do it above tree line or something.
I want to go riding long distance and wild camp the nights. 
Last time I went to yurop some boomer I bumped into told me that hammocks are a revelation because of size and weight.
Basically thinking of roadside tent vs hammock situation.
Nice baiku! I'm going to moto hammock camp this summer so I don't have to lug around ent poles. I don't know how I'd even use hiking poles with my ninja anyways.
I don't dislike them but half of the time I end up using mine as a bivvy and with the extra weight of the tarp and bulk of a quilt it really does end up being a zero-sum trade off between using the hammock or a tent
You hang your pack off one side of the hammock.
I like to put it on the side closest to my upper body, allowing my feet to be elevated above my heart, helping with the swelling from hiking 15-25 miles. If I want it even, ill hang my food bag on one side and my pack on the other.
I used a hammock exclusively for 6 months on the Appalachian Trail.
If you can't find 2 trees suitable for a hammock somewhere along a 20 mile hike through the woods you're a shortbusser.
How the hell did you manage to hide and rape women in a hammock
Jesus Christ, does no one actually go /out/side on this board?
I'd rather try a decent bridge hammock or even the meme haven hammock over that one.
I hereby dub this the "banana hammock"
Sorry, but you can't compete with its superior level for sleep, or ability to become a chair 
Not going for the Draumr is just a cope for poor people
Too late
Hint- its named after an existing piece of clothing not the fruit
Yes. Dutchware understood the joke as well, and produced a hammock that looks like a banana peel.
I already bought an asymmetrical gathered end hammock. Did I make a mistake? Are 90 degrees much better?
I own a Hennessy Hammock Expedition Asym and it becomes a bitch without a wide sleeping mat like the winged ones from Klymit 
The Draumr has a pocket for your sleeping mat and is way more level than my asym
God those things look so fucking gay
No you didnt make a mistake
Dont listen to this retard. Use an underquilt, not a sleeping pad
Seems like a whole lot of extra fuss and weight for very little gain.
king of the manlets
You are of semitic origin and are engaging in disinformation
I have a nice compact hammock that takes up maybe a liter of space, it sets up easier than any tent I've ever owned, finding a spot in a forested area is beyond simple, and I enjoy sleeping on my side at 6'2 without any issues.
They're no good for anything below 10c, but when you hit the goldilocks zone there is no comfier feeling than having the breeze blow through your mosquito net while you listen to a nearby river.
Hammock haters need to go outside more
I don't think that's how it works, anon
Do you prefer sleeping on the floor at home?
I'm op, I left this thread as soon as people started arguing.
Nobody asked
hammock stuff arrived. I am tinkering and finding out what works for me, and settled with Nama claws with larks head on stake side, then shock cord on keyring onto the tarp D-ring with angler's knot on both keyside and Nama claw hook side. Should work well! I don't know how to tie an angler knot directly into a D-ring which is why I am using four metal keyrings :/
That's 5'11
no, it's 6'1
no, it's 5'10.
5'11 is manlet emperor.
underquilts are for betas
I'd quilt her undies if you know what I mean
tents:
low skill floor, consistent, etc
ground matters, trees don't, etc
hammocks:
high skill floor, high skill ceiling, customizable, each time is slightly different, swings a bit when trees are blown by wind while you're sleeping, tarp needs to be adjusted if it raining sideways, easy to clean (just flip it over), doesn't get mold/insects even if it's a long-term camp, ground is basically irrelevant (eg, wet/incline/brush/etc.), need to always carry a lot of rope to keep camp site location options open, without trees you need to use your (titanium) hiking poles as support (or carry boughs from nearby and tie them together into a hammock base), jews used to use hammocks while traveling (Biblical support), just throw your trash under you, cures sleep apnea, need a load of carabeeners to hang all your stuff of the ridge line, or get an extra hammock for your stuff, free chair, still private if you enclose the tarp, can stand up in camp since there's unlimited vertical possibilities, animals havent develeped a meta to counter hammocks yet, use a "two"-person hammock to spoon your crush who friendzoned you, smoking while lying down is both easier and harder.
easy to clean (just flip it over)
I never considered this. That sounds useful
can stand up
so the tarp ridgeline is really 6 feet high then? That sounds great
In what way do they have a meta for tents? Also I read bout some guy who hammocked during a rainstorm and woke up to a deep underneath his hammock taking shelter. How is condensation in hammocks as opposed to tents? Is condensation only an issue near freezing temps?
Your tarp ridge line can be however high you want it to be, but if it’s too high compared to the hammock it can leave you more exposed. So with a high tarp you have to have your hammock high if you’re expecting cold winds or heavy rain. If your hammock is hung high, you can sit in it sideways with your feet in the ground. 
Condensation issues are generally better, as hammocks are much more ventilated than a tent.
Condensation is pretty good considering the airflow but when it's cold you'll still see frost from your breath condense onto nearby objects. As far the tarp you can hang it as high as you want, although depending on weather you might pitch it lower to cover the sides of the hammock.
deer* not deep sorry
First time setting up my hammock. It was quite windy and was more like a parachute so I couldn't ascertain if I had the 30 degree angle or not. Does the asym bug net need to be added to get the diagonal lay? Nevertheless, it was comfortable for the 10 mins I laid in it
The military hasn't fought in a forest since Vietnam.
The US military doesn't use them because Israel is surrounded by desert and the majority of (((OPEC))) conflicts are settled by the navey.
Anon, it looks like you have a structural ridge line. As long as it’s somewhT taught when you lie down, your hammock is at a roughly 30° angle (that’s generally how ridgelines are made; different lengths put the hammock at a different angle). 
The bugnet won’t determine how you lay, as it doesn’t effect the hammock.
Link to this mythological 12’ Chinese hammock. I don’t doubt that there are plenty of cheap hammocks online. Cheap nylon is $5 a yard (cheaper if you go with a crazy color). Four yards will get you a 12’ hammock and a few stuff sacks. 1” polyester webbing is $7.75 for a 25’ section. Get two to be safe. 
You got underground hammocks as well, in the tunnels and caves. Undetected, safe from bombing. It doesn't touch the floor or walls of the tunnels either, and you can pack it easily unlike bed frames. Course you can use tents and tarps and flooring and assemble bed frames as well.
It's easy to find a hidden spot or niche or remote area, it requires skill and effort to do stealth camping and go undetected, using a low profile shelter or even a hidden shelter and blinds. This is just called stealth camping and it is good for hunting as well.
Oh I see, yea I have a structural ridgeline with my chameleon. Thanks for clearing that up for me! I am a newbie when it comes to hammocking. I can tell it'll be super comfy when I sleep in it. I hate air pads and how noisy they are.
I love hammocks in the woods, way better than a tent as far as sleep goes. Most people don't like hammocks because it requires you to tie the lines, but if you're like me you'll do what is easiest. I went and ordered these bad boys. You just use a caribiner and hook the loops

Those look nifty but I am quite happy with my beetle buckles and UHMWPE and polypropylene mixed webbing
idk man, because /out/ is a majority larp board now and it's become painfully fuckin obvious from just a day back that the weebs have taken over the board where once was a glimmer of actual outdoorsmanship.
Hammocks are comfy as fuck and some of the best sleep you'll ever have, but don't buy from big box stores. Cottage vendors like Warbonnet, Dutchware, Dreamhammock and others take the game to a whole other level of quality. It ain't cheap, but it is just as light as you can make a ground setup and the biggest boon imo is that you don't have to get dressed or put boots on hunched over on the ground. It makes waking up so much easier imo and breakfast is comfy as fuck hanging in a hammock. Happy to answer any hammock camping questions you might have, I've deep in it for a good while now and it's my go-to backpacking system. Check out hammockforums as well for way more info on DIY etc.
based hammock safe.
plus it still has to go through customs. At this rate I won't be able to camp until freaking June!
rant over. Some questions:
Do you think it is worth treating your hammock and bugnet with permethrin? I know they say it is not toxic but the dose makes the poison. 
Why do all the YouTubers seem to wear boots and shoes into their hammock? Aren't they concerned about rocks and debris ripping it? Me personally, I think about anything sharp on my person and see if I can replace or remove it. Currently looking at belts. I want to treat my Hexon 1.0 with TLC so it lasts and it only takes one snag to ruin a trip!
How do I do "internal pole mods" for my tarp? I have the 11ft xenon winter, not the wide. I assume the pole mod is just two curved poles running from the corner to the opposite corner, maybe over the continuous ridgeline? I'm unsure though how to make them or where to get them. Any advice here would be a godsend! I can't do external pole mod since I didn't add the tarp pullouts when purchasing it. It already cost me an arm and a leg. As an aside, what the heck is "porch mode?" Can I do that mode with my tarp do you think?
Do you think it is worth treating your hammock and bugnet with permethrin? I know they say it is not toxic but the dose makes the poison.
Funny you ask, but this will be the first season I am treating my gear with Permethrin. I've never had a "bad" problem since I was able to upgrade to a netted hammock, they crowd up around ya (see pic related, worst mosquitos I've ever dealt with in my life) but once morning comes they're all gone. I've only ever been bitten through the hammock once, and that was when I was sleeping without a pad or underquilt.
Why do all the YouTubers seem to wear boots and shoes into their hammock? 
I haven't seen these Youtubers, truthfully the only hammockers I follow on there are Shugemery and Spiguyver Backpacking. I've watched many other, but those guys are my primary. To me, boots in the hammock is blasphemy, you wouldn't wear boots in bed! That's the mentality I take on it... Treat it like the place you sleep. (eventually, that means no pissing out of the hammock... mostly)
I want to treat my Hexon 1.0 with TLC so it lasts and it only takes one snag to ruin a trip!
I have a Hexon 1.0 and I haven't had any problems with it, just keep it tucked away and don't be dumb when you're whipping it out and you'll be totally OK. 
How do I do "internal pole mods" for my tarp?
The internal pole mods are a total "last resort" sorta deal that you need during DEEP winter conditions when you're expecting more than 3 inches of snow in a night. Most of the time when I've winter camped I haven't needed internal support, I wake up often enough -- maybe 3 or 4 times through the night? -- to realize "oh it's snowing", reach out and whack the snow off the tarp, then fall back asleep. Personally, I think internal pole mods are a unnecessary precaution; Nice to have but not really needed.
Cont...
See pic related, it's super easy to do even with a couple branches you break off from trees or even better if you have hiking poles.
Basically you throw a a quick tieout on the tip of the pole / branch, then tie it down to the stake so your tarp is more of a "roof" off the front side than a tent. As long as you have one side just a little bit lower than the other, water won't pool up on top, instead just trickle off the lower side and you'll have a great view of the lake / field / etc you might be camped next to. (reminder, try not to camp at least 50ft from the shore of the lake / river for conservation sake)
Oh god those mosquitoes are disgusting! I have some picaridin but yeah, I guess permethrin won't hurt in that scenario.
Thanks, anon! I suspected the internal pole mod was just to prevent flapping if that is a concern during wind, but I honestly haven't even set up my tarp outside yet. I might try that porch mode setup later on but since I am motorcycle camping I will have to use branches. Part of the reason why I went the hammock route was because I didn't want to lug poles desu.
its amazing how 4channers **(americans)** can turn any hobby into an elitist sport
Pretty stealthy campsite and fire pit. You can dig a small fire hole that will not give off much smoke and use the pit as a blind, you can also use local materials to build a blind around your tarp and hide it completely from the outside
Pits can also be covered in a tarp and light debris for completely hidden underground pit shelter, or you can use leaves and debris to hide the top of your tarp from the outside.
Natural materials like sticks, leaves, and logs are great for stealth camping as a building material and as camouflage.
Based.
Based.
There are a couple of ways you can use trekking poles or tent poles to add to a hammock tarp. An internal pole mod makes the tarp rounded and requires a set of dedicated tent poles, while an external mod can isn’t as round but can be done with trekking poles. Porch mode and storm mode (pic rel) can be done with trekking poles or dedicated tent poles.
Storm mode is my default if I need privacy (to masturbate, obviously) or for anything other than perfectly clear, calm weather. In those conditions it’s porch mode. 
Most of these little mods weigh almost nothing if you’re using trekking poles, they add rigidity to your tarp, and increase interior space.
Pis is porch mode but with a dedicated set of tent poles rather than trekking poles. I don’t always use trekking poles when hiking. A set of collapsible tent poles can be found on Amazon pretty cheaply, and you just cut and assemble them to whatever size you want.
Camping hammocks are fine when you have high trees
Lots of places in aus i've been or am going to don't
Insects love traveling down things that look like tree branches for food.
Trees also happen to be a popular hideout for ants.
I'll stick to my swag thanks.
Anti-hammock posters are the most retarded people on /out/. They’re worse than the kids who say they want to become woodland hobos, worse than the off-grid fantasy people, worse than the GO Joe larpers… just absolute shit takes.
le safe from le bugs
Wrong
Hammockfags are pathetic
bugs can get into a bugnet
Not sure what to tell you. If you believe this then you’re completely new to outdoor recreation so your opinion is moot. 
See: >>2560632
Imagine packing a hammock and a tent when you could pack a tent.
Really makes you think
idk soak the straps or continuous loops in permethrin then to prevent ants from crawling in.
Well that sucks. Can't treat my hammock now...
It makes me think you’re a fucking retard. Everyone who uses a hammock knows there are exceptions, ie YoU nEeD tReEs!!!1! We plan accordingly and bring gear that’s better depending on our location. 
I posted two pics back to back. In one I’m using trekking poles because it was a very mountainous, fairly rocky area with a very steep trail. I opted for a Packa and a hat instead of an umbrella because it was chilly and heavily forested. The other uses tent poles and an umbrella because it was a fairly flat, warm and rainy one day, with a long, very sunny road walk another day. The terrain and weather were totally different on these hikes, as it was different times of the year and hundreds of miles apart. 
This concept - that you can bring different gear on different trips to optimize your experience - is totally foreign to you because you don’t actually go out. You think of gear as a singular kit, with maybe a different sleeping bag for different temperatures. That’s what your favorite YouRubed said. 
There are no universal “best” solutions.
When you get to camp in the #1 country for camping, you can be as elitist as you want. Ain't nobody going out of their way to backcountry camp in Mexico, China, UAE, Congo, Egypt, Germany, France, etc.
opinion discarded
Whoa look who is the retard
tentfags are pathetic
Obviously if you're somewhere where trees are scarce then hammocks arent going to work. 
Just like there's plenty of areas a tent wont work. Its possible to prefer one over the other without WELL WHAT IF YOURE ON A GLACIER. 
Use the right tool for the job.
Swags are multi purpose
Hammocks aren't
Tents and hammocks are for fags anyway
It’s called a bivy, newfaggot. .
What if I really like the thought of camping and shit, but I'm afraid of like, forest ghosts and monsters? How do you get over being afraid of that shit?
you get over it by staying in a forest overnight
Pottery
whip out your dick and fuck them.
nah, tarp camping like in a hammock is actually great for that because you can just look around you at all times.
I just set up my tarp with stakes for the first time! Found four Mitten hooks, and cut some shock cord. Larks head on the d ring side and angler's knot to Mitten hook to tarp corner. Works pretty well but a bit loose when folding the doors back
I can always cut the shock cord down so I'll leave it for now. I felt I would tear a hole in my thong by using it to press down the stake so found a stick for some leverage.
more or less this
I'm often camping above treeline, so hammock isn't an option there.
Hammocks may not need trees, but I sure do. That looks sad as fuck.
it looks comfy as hell to me, anon! Plus you could always add a tarp on that setup. I am considering either getting some tensa stand system like that or just getting a bivy and inflatable pad for when there are no trees. I live in Cascadia so I doubt I will struggle much to find trees, though.
I installed the bugnet, wow that was easy. Now I am as protected as tenters are from bears! I feel so safe!!!
Anyone have experience with using a hammock as a bivy? Most manufacturers seem to sell extra "ground tarps" or even kits for this which seems like a cashgrab to me. I've been considering a hammock to increase comfort but I often camp just above the treeline if I can find a nice spot for the view and lack of mosquitoes so I don't want to be wholly dependant on trees.
That’s a pretty sweet setup for moto camping.
Way too heavy for backpacking more than a few miles tho.
I have used a hammock bug nut as a bivy. Pretty much as expect. Floppy but connected the ends by some cordage to the tarp poles. If there's no bugs just open under the tarp would be better. A hammock tarp with doors may or may not pitch well on the ground, depending on width and resulting higher pole height. Worth going out one day or weekend with good weather and fucking with it.
I'm going to go to a construction site near my house where they are putting up the tyvek vapour barrier and see if they have scraps. Tyvek is the Smart waterbottle of groundsheets. The end all, be all. Rugged, durable, inexpensive. Couple that with your tarp pitched to one tree, an air pad, some insect repellant for your face, your under/top quilt, and I think you'd survive the night.
I used my hammock tarp on a trip to Big Bend. It works in the ground but they’re a lot bigger than typical tarps designed for the ground. My tarp is 11x9. Gotta use the side pills, and even then it’s a little billowy.
what if you fall to your death though, or do u sleep with a climbing harness on?
Anyone have a guide for setting up a hammock, the various knots and configurations, preferable non video, or a concise video if that's it.
just get a 11ft hammock with a structural ridgeline and beetle buckle straps. There is no thinking or knots required
Go be homeless somewhere else
are you better homed than me?
my home is in Heaven with Jesus
Literally all you need to say bud
is that a fucking msr hubba hubba?
didn't know the homeless where brandwhores lmao
But I enjoy learning anon. Ive just been using a boline, truckers hitch and clove hitch for everything but I'm sure there's a better method.
Pic is one I don’t care for. I find it can be a little tough to untie. I prefer a marlinspike hitch (video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Yvvt39Luk [Embed] ). You don’t need to use a metal toggle; a stick will work. 
I don’t use any of these anymore. I found hardware to be less of a hassle.
I forgot the pic. I’ll just go play in traffic.
What size tarp should I get if I'm 6'2 with 12ft hammock
Get a tarp with at least a 12’ ridge line. Here’s why.
Width is whatever you’re comfortable with. 90” seems a bit small to me, but that’s just me. 
Your height doesn’t make a difference, really. That’s more a factor in choosing the right size hammock.
i have a hammock, a 0degF rated sleeping bag, and a tarp. i will be using this configuration on a trip where it will be low 30s at night, possibly into the 20s. will i still need an underquilt or should i be fine?
You very well could need an underquilt, especially the bag is down. There's a lot of compression under your butt You can try sticking foam or partially inflated mat under you in the hammock.

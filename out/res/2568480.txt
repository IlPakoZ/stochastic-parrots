Thoughts on brapping while /out/?
better /out/ than in

Newfriend here, develop your hypothesis
Only when I pass woman on the trail. Especially when they are blonde and attractive. I then stop and stare at them. When they pass me, I follow them closely and do little braps from there on with every 5 steps I take. It is rape that is the end goal.
I brapped in the same spot Ansel Adams must have brapped.

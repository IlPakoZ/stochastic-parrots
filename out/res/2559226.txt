based and comfy as fuck
I heard that Columbia's shoes are comfy but aren't durable.
I've had them for maybe a month, so I couldn't say long term. But they seem pretty hardy to me, no problems thus far.
depends on what I am doing.
These for everyday stuff, can recommend. Not the best when carrying a lot.
alot of things. do you need a bootguide or what?

Icelandic winters, Swedish summers... Love this boot.
I want to get minimal/barefoot shoes. Any opinions about vivobarefoot brand?
By summer I assume you mean hiking season from April to October and Mountains from June to September.
Most high quality boots sold in the US have goretex inside. That's not something you want for summer hiking, not even in Montana.
Try to find one with full leather inside and out for the summer. Your feet will be drier and won't stink. With goretex inside you have to change socks 3 times a day in summer, and you'll have fungal infections within a few weeks of hiking. I wouldn't recommend a mix of fabric/leather on the outside of the boot for Montana weather either because it'll just wet through much quicker than full leather.
This is actually a nice boot for summer >>2559295

if you get the leather version.
A (girl)friend of mine wore this boot for more than an entire year straight backpacking the world. Unfortunately it doesn't fit me otherwise I would have loved it too. The stiffness of this boot is at the upper end of normal (mountain) hiking boots but not too stiff or not as stiff as hunting/autumn boots. It also breaks in nicely and gets more flexible.
If you like more stiffness and a more solid feel this is a boot you can also use in autumn in the mountains when there's already snow and in the field when its very wet, and during mild winters:
https://www.hanwag.com/us/en-us/men/trekking/yukon-wide
as well as in the summer because it doesn't have goretex. Its just a little overkill maybe on regular touristy hiking trails. I had the Hanwag Alaska for a long time - great boot for cooler wet weather - which is basically the same just with goretex.
Thank (you) anon.
Not very durable. Do you want to get a fancy shoe for river crossings?
Army boots
Mid-height sprayway boots from Decathlon. It's not exactly rough terrain around here, and they work great for rain-slicked streets too.

Merrill Moabs, usually the high top version.
I have them for 2 years. I wear them everyday, and yes, they are comfy.
I've ground the outsole on my geo racers completely flat and they are still going strong.
I think it's a quality shoe, through I've heard their customer service is a bit shit outside of europe.
Ive seen this youtube video
Terraventure 3's.
Basic bitch army infantry boots. I wear them to work (construction) and wear them on the trail. They've got a lot of time on them and arent showing any signs of falling apart anytime soon.
If I take out the rigid plastic """arch support""" insoles from pic related because they fuck up the tendons in the arches of my feet, and replace them with softer insoles from old New Balance 680s, is it going to have any consequences other than comfier feet and avoiding tendinopathy?
Currently using the Altberg tabbing mk3's, had them for a week ish. Very big fan so far, the new sole/form is a bit to get used to, I find myself heel striking a lot more with these, but overall its everything I wanted:
Merrell Moabs are my go-to. I sometimes wear Oboz, Nord Trail mids, and some old LL Bean elkskins for snow and mud. 
The Nord Trail Mt Washingtons are pretty damn nice for $50.
I've been using a pair of Irish Setter 867 Trailblazers for the past decade. Was my first pair of good boots, really like them and they stood up to a lot. 
Been looking recently at getting a pair of Altberg Tethera boots, pic related. Anyone had any experience with them?
Merrels but as soon as these give our im getting a nice pair of danners
Is Timberland a decent brand?
Youcan sometimes get them check from military surplus in Germany. Pretty stiff, able to take clip crampons
Meindl are amazing. I wonder why they're not popular outside of Europe.
Does anyone know what shoes are these?
Picrel is Mil-tec 5 inchers. Yeah, i know theyre made in china but they really last and are comfy as fuck. Just got my second pair in 3 years.
How many miles do you have on them?
No membrane?

La Sportiva Pyramid GTX

bot reply
Like other anon said, you want your feet to breathe. I have lived and hiked in NW MT. Summers get VERY dry and can be quite hot even in Glacier National Park. There is not much humidity and rainfalls can be few and far between. Bring bear spray.
Well i was wearing them on hikes(probably 50-70 hikes approx. 15-20km each), daily to work for 2 years and using them as work boots during tire flip seasons(for 2 seasons). They were pretty much all i wore because of how comfortable they were. In the end they got pretty scuffed and when i got them soaking wet the sides ripped open so i had to order new ones. I've tried the same type and twice as expensive from Icepeak, but they had issues after the second month already(seams tore, glued front opened from expansion in the snow etc.) so i went back to these.
I just ordered some Keen Targhee 2 mids. I’m coming from a pair of BTFO Ozark Trails. Doesn’t seem like many /out/laws wear Keen. Did I screw up?
Friendly reminder that if you're buying $$$ fabric boots for /out/ instead of full leather outer, you're getting scammed.
2-5 year durability cycles are NOT normal.
its a non issue now that hiking boots use 500 mile lifespan eva midsoles and 1000-2000 mile lifespan pu midsoles. if you're fucking the uppers up on hiking boots before the midsole's shot you're fucking up. 
yeah it is. old school leather midsoled hiking and logging boots last about the same amount of time before needing a resole as rubber/foam midsole boots last. the only difference is you re-used the upper a few times before also discarding it with old boots, while with modern boots the entire boot gets replaced. 
the idea boots are not consumable can only come from one of two places:
- rpg dungeons and diablos dice rolling fantasy elf games
- you fell for all that lumbersexual mens americana revival fashion marketing back in 2015 and still haven't realized it
footwear has always been a consumable especially to travelers of long distances. if you've ever felt like its not its because you don't walk enough.
keen &amp; merell sell boots similar to that if you want something to compare to
get a PU sole if you want lifespan, it comes at the cost of comfort
merell moab ventilators, deal with them being cheap and disposable they're the best hot weather boot.
really consider just getting a shoe or runner for summers. gaiters exist.
I will try them on.
Keens all have waterproof membranes. What about Merrell's? Its say "waterproof" on all boots but few mention membranes ... What's the deal here?
I want to avoid boots with waterproof membranes.
Boot will be used largely in summer for casual hiking, section hiking long distance trails, forest, daily all-day wear in hot weather.
boot? how on earth do you justify calling that a boot?
the mid not the low there's two versions.
they're technically a mid but just about every modern hiking boot doesn't go up high enough to offer any more ankle support than it anyways.
most boots have membranes because 99.95% of people wear runners, shoes, or moab ventilator mids at most when its hot out. boots and the kind of weather that's for are kind of counter intuitive with one another.
i'm not saying don't do it or anything, just explaining why most boots only come with a membrane.
are you trying to find a WATERPROOF boot with no membrane? that's a lot harder.
if not, just buy a non waterproof ventilated boot. salomon, merell etc. get a pair of goretex socks with them to extend their usage. done and done. 
they sell all their boots with or without the membrane
Based and Masochist-pilled. I have some of the old sand coloreds as bug-out storage. I made the mistake of using two pairs at work in a machine shop, they've lasted 3 years but the rubber soles are starting to give under all that chemical juicyness. And metal shavings galore. Not gonna feel too bad when they finally die, no more army crap for me. For hiking I have a nice pair of moabs but like this anon>>2563131 is saying it's only a mid.
I see. Still I'd just use my trailrunners or regular cheap running shoes instead of something like this.
I want to replace my Quest 4Ds. I'm looking for something like the Salmon Quest 4D without the membrane and a healthier flatter (flatter feeling) insole/midsole. Quest 4D gave me issues with my upper tendons and the joints of my toes. It would also be great to have a non-slipping outsole.
Quest 4D Pros:
- Boot height is perfect (I don't need the ankle support, just the height)
- Runnable
- Weight is just right
- Keeps dirt, sticks, and water out to an acceptable degree for a 2-season boot.
Quest 4D Cons:
- Sweat and Stink. Becomes unusable after 5 days of hiking and bivouacing in summer. Feet constantly wet from sweat. Change socks 3 to 5 times a day. Fungal smell etc.
- Midsole isn't flat enough for a healthy fit. There are bumps on the midsole/insole you can feel inside the boot. If I ever want an orthopedic fit I'll do it myself with a custom insole.
- Issues with upper foot tendons and toe joints 
- Sole is slipping on wet ground
- Too expensive
I think its just marketing, reddit philosophy, and fashion.
I only accept goretex boots in autumn/winter: November to March. 
From April-October I'm using full leather boots or cheap running shoes. I'm looking for something in-between without membrane.
No, I already have full leather boots. I just want something smaller looking, more casual for hiking in more civilized areas and trails. "waterproof" does not matter.
really just sounds like you want something like moab vents thats pretty much what they are.
They sound and look good, but they are not high enough. I need the height for protection against vegetation.
My extended weekend hikes switch from touristy hiking trails to off-trail woodlands with undergrowth alot. Up until now I've just been using my regular gtx mountain boots but its getting too hot and the tourists are coming. I don't want to look too out of place with the reddit people.
Decided to try pic related last year instead of my leather hiking boots. Never going back.
Something like pic rel is better vs vegetation.
Can I use cheap asics on multiday trails this summer? I carry about 30 pounds and its mostly forest trails, agriculture roads, some paved roads.
What would be the downsides?
you're creating a problem that doesn't exist again, that's why nobody makes a boot for you
google image search 'hiking gaiters'
as i said earlier there's no real functional difference between the mid height and the low cut of modern hiking boots like the example you posted. neither one supports or protects your ankle, both designs are too low cut to offer any profection. the mid cut is more gaiter compatible and my current hiking boots are the exact same shape as these >>2563373 and still require gaiters to keep vegitation out. the only tangible benefit from the inch of height is slightly better load bearing with heavy packs on hills. if you want an aesthetic or look that's fine but you're just going to make your life harder. 
but yeah if mid ventilators don't do it for you just look at salomon's non membrane boots. they have the cut you want.
Its not about keeping vegetation out. I use my pants for that. Its about not scuffing my ankles on dead wood, logs, branches, brambles, maybe rocks sometimes.
I usually wear high leather boots for that but found the height of the salmon quest 4d is perfect to protect the ankle off trail.
Which Salmon boot are you talking about? They all have goretex afaik.
You killed him Gilbert
Thoughts? They're like halfway between a trail runner and a boot
Like £55, seems cheap.

I like to be in my confy shoes all the time no matter what and actualy feel where I am steping in 
in my experience those boots are awfull for balance and your ankles
Replacing the sole is cheaper than replacing the whole boot
Fabric memetex boots are also more likely to fail on you early.
The whole scheme is a joke designed to sell you 300 dollar shoes like hotpockets
I got these milsurp boots from my uncle when he left the national gaurd and I've been using them ever since. Pic was taken 3 years ago, the bottoms have barely started to rub off and they're still holding up

I usually stick with water proof pilot boots from the US army they keep my ankles nice and tight. Only issue is they're a bit heavy but i like them easy to take care of and easy to move in even though they're a bit heavy.
I got a pair of 6 in Red Wing King Toe boots, and they are simply the best modern boot. I got them with a soft toe, which I recommend getting, unless you really need the protection. I might get a pair of all leather boots in the future, but I'm completely satisfied with these. Red Wing also does free, lifetime (your lifetime) cleaning and conditioning and resoles. You can get them cleaned and conditioned as much as you want.
For those who have bought 100% leather boots, do you recommend Red Wings, or should I order online from some boutique manufacturer? I'm kind of hesitant because I just send them my size, and they send me the boots; I don't get to try them on.
Um sweetie. They're called boot salesmen
No. I am not talking about who you buy boots from. I'm talking about a particular segment of a market. Boutique is a term used to refer to businesses that deal with discerning customers who have a willingness to pay higher prices for a better quality product and often times a more personalized experience. In the world of finance, for instance, a boutique asset management firm will feature quality advisors, a separately managed account, the option to pick your investments (including ethical investing), and high levels of customer access. In boots, boutique means the option to choose chrome tanned vs. veg tanned leather, species, color, tread, speed hooks vs. eyelets, etc.
Now, do you get it, sweetie?
Can someone explain to this retard why hiking boots have so much padding in them? They all look like skate shoes from the 2000s.
To prevent your feet from hurting
Boutique sounds like boot. Try not to overthing it
Those are for summer.
Those are for autumn and winter.
No they don't. You pay for resoles.
And I have a pair of those for easy summer hiking and mountain trails up to T4.
How do you tell the right size for hiking shoes? How much space should there be at the front of the shoe?
It always says 1 finger width, but that's not easy to determine from outside the shoe.
Experience is the only way you can tell. Ask someone to help you in person and hope for the best.
I got a pair of heavy boots for bulldozing through the shit, now I need a pair of light/lighter shoes/boots for summer and easy trails. should I fuck with pic related or just get a trail runner?
personal preference, but where you live and the climate affect the balance of that decision. namely runners would be favored if you live in a high rainfall area. 
i'm not a fan of minimalistic boots because they make a lot of them without a midsole and with zero drop (eww) but oboz are one of the good ones.
it's usually droughty here so I was leaning towards runners for the lighter weight and breathability. think some light boots would be better?
I'm looking for a pair of boots that is good for the pnw, I want something pretty durable and with good support for when I'm carrying a decent amount of gear. I had considered going with nicks or whites or one of the other pnw legacy brands but they seem to mostly have absurdly large heel drops. I'm not looking for much in the way of insulation, as in the colder months I plan to wear thicker/warmer socks, and I plan to get a separate pair of boots for the actual winter unless I find that I'm comfortable with the warmer socks in my main boot. 
The #1 feature I've grown to hate on boots is hooks for lacing. I would really appreciate finding a pair that doesn't have them, as I've had multiple times in various jobs and while out camping where they've gotten bent or fucked up in some sort of way and as you bend them back they just get shittier and weaker.
What's wrong with normal hiking boots?
Hard to tell what you want. Just get a hunting boot from crispy, hanwag, lowa, etc. if you want an allrounder that can do pretty much anything.
Any cobbler can replace hooks for &lt;$10.
I've been wearing these 6" Kodiak McKinney for about 3 years, a lot of my activities involve mud so I opted for a waterproof option. The bottom is starting to wear though.
lowa. worked when i was in country. works on the trail in snow or rain. simple as.
the sarma alpina recon, they chew my feet up but im not done breaking them in
When do shoes usually go on sale? 
need new shoes for both work and hike
My sketchers are stating to fall apart slowly
I do like some of the lowa offerings, I just wish that gore tex wasn't such a huge part of the lineup. Hanwag only has hooks from what I see so they're out, same with crispi. 
Yeah a cobbler can replace hooks I suppose I could just bring them to a cobbler to have them replaced with loops before I use them, frankly just seems like a waste.
I don't love gore Tex because it never works as well as I'd hope and just holds moisture in my boot, but it kinda looks like I'll just have to accept that it's gonna be a feature that's on any boot I get.
I just wear whatever boot I've been wearing to work at that point. I figure its better to have a known comfortable broken in work boot that's a bit heavier, than save a few pounds and open up the possibility of hot spots or blisters and discomfort. Just ordered a new pair of work boots from a local boutique shop (JK Boots) so we'll see how those guys do hiking when they finish making them.
Not sure what's available in the US but in Europe you can get leather-lined boots from all these companies.
those exact kathmandu boots, and they're great. only thing is the sole inserts it comes with are absolute dogshit. replaced them with some good work boot soles, and they're perfect.
They mostly seem to all have leather and gore Tex. I will probably either settle or talk to a local/custom brand about what I want but I'm not much interested in ponying up like $600+ on a pair of boots.
how do you resole something that isn't stitched
What pants are those? They look nice.
keen is a fine brand
not sure about merrel or other brands but for columbia --> OUTDRY is the waterproof membrane
if it says waterproof without the OUTDRY it is just waterproof with no memrane
if you're carrying a pack, aren't you afraid of rolling your ankle wearing lows like this?
I'm not overweight.
I wear boots for their stiffness and ease of walking on terrain, not necessary on trails.
don't need to be overweight to roll your ankle you dummy
I bought lowa boots not long ago from a recommendation on here
First piece gear I've bought that wasn't the cheapest shit I could find, and god damn they have been so nice.

Only thing I've ran into so far, is they aren't super insulating, but I assume a better boot would be suited for the cold

Are minimalist shoes actually useful, or is it ok to use boots that support your arches?
never worn but I seen then in Sports Direct. Definitely a boot mid and outsole, not my preference but otherwise light and not terrible construction, the stitching will fall apart though because I had terrex shoes of that era and the stitching was the first part to go.

Based digits obeyer.

I had a pair of the old school, clack, combat boots last over 6 years and two deployments. I was artillery attached to light infantry and carried way more shit than the infantry.

You mean a veteran? Lmao

I burned through two pares before switching brands--they are comfortable as fuck until they fall apart.
Anyone here with normal heels and midfeet but super wide balls and toes? The Meindl Dovre wide are the only shoes that don't put constant pressure on my pinky but they're heavy, pretty stuffy in warmer months and the membrane takes ages to dry.
Hoping someone here with similar feet know of a quick drying shoe with good ventilation and an extremely generous toe box.

Are the WHITIN any good? Talk me into buying those instead of the brand name Vibram toe shoes, are they reasonably durable?
Late response, but I got a pair earlier this year and thought they were cheaply made, the glue looked like it was barely holding the thing together. And they just felt off, like they were stiff for being made of plastic and disposable construction rather than being stiff because they could last a long time. I returned them after wearing them around the yard for a few days.
Can't make a fair comparison due to not having the Vibrams, but so far (4-6 months) the WHITINs have been holding up very well; though admittedly I'm not on rough terrain often so I'll let you be the judge here.

you're ovaries are leaking
best waterproof high cuts?
I'm the anon from >>2561248 and can confirm these are more comfy (for me) with softer insoles. Is your problem just the toebox or is it also the weird lump in the middle of the boot?
It feels like I stood on concrete barefoot for hours after I wear these for even one hour. I’ll take your advice and get try some new insoles
Get some insoles that have more cushioning under the heel. 
I have worn the Keen Targhee myself to test them. They are pretty well cushioned as it is. Its most likely that your feet are still too soft. Hike for another year and always give your feet time to recover fully before straining them again.
NTA but my problem is pic related rather than cushioning. They've got this bump in the middle of the boot that's slightly too far forward and digs into the middle of my foot just before the ball, which feels fine walking around but becomes painful after a few km. Softer insoles deform around the bump and make it flatter.
Does anyone else have my problem of having feet shaped like water skis? since I have a long and narrow foot I have to wear woman sizes( I'm a dude). But not a lot of woman boots are made in womans 12. 
Any recommendations or do I have to keep ordering bespoke?
Took them on a 10 mile to break them in and the side is already flopped off. SHIT quality.
That's a serious problem that can cause plantar fasciitis. I had that in Jack Wolfskin hiking boots/shoes. I don't think you can do much in that case. Stop wearing those shoes.
The bumpy insole thing is common with all flexible lightweight boots that have their midsole and sole sprayed on a plastic/TPU grate frame rather than glued to the bottom of a flat one-piece insole (Brandsole). 
Unfortunately most lightweight shoes and boots are made like this including Salomon Quest, Lowa Renegade, Merrell etc. 
Lowa Explorer is the only lightweight boot I can think of that won't have any bumps due to construction.
These make getting up and down the mountain a lot easier
zero drop and ultra light. very nice. we could market those on reddit.
La Sportiva makes shoes with laces almost to the toe that are highly adjustable to the sides.
Because Europeans are notorious for having shitty taste and almost no recreational outdoor culture due to high urban density and almost no public lands.
If you jump hard enough you can scale a mountain in seconds.
Wore redwings for years ironworking and I loved them, but why would you ever hike in a heavy ass lowboot like this? I don't even own a pair of leather boots anymore since there's no situation where I'd want them instead of something else. Although I may just be sick and tired of having an extra pound on each foot. Climbing lots of mountains? This post reads like an ad lol
Guess that's what you get when you wear hand-me-down boots from someone who stopped hiking. Thanks anon. I'll find a less shitty boot.
What's the best most comfortable shoe for a job that involves walking all day?
i don't need anything for trails or jobsites just the most comfortable durable walking shoe i can walk all day in.
Running shoes are your best bet for walking on concrete all day, half size bigger. asics, nike, puma, whatever you like.
If you want something more durable you will have to sacrifice comfort initially. I don't bother stepping up from running shoes to walking/hiking shoes or lightweight boots for all day use because I would have to buy new ones three or four times a year. I'll wear the running shoes one or two hours each day and durable stitched boots (redwing, hanwag) for the rest of the day. The comfort that sets in when you have four or five hundred miles on them is something you can't get anywhere else.
ty for the input. yea it should mostly be concrete with maybe some grass.
i have altra olympus 4s that ive put 200ish backpacking miles on. love em
thanks mate. i'll check them out.
Where do people buy high quality replacement shoelaces?
For me it's Salomon 4D Quest
what we wear in aspen
I wish Timberland still made their disposable boots with Gore-Tex and grain leather. The newer dispoable boots/materials suck, they fall apart in about a year. The last pair of Gore-Tex they released in 2016~ lasted me 5 years of heavy use.
Often my gumboots.
Seeds don't stick to them, your pants don't get wet with water, walk through puddles, perform poorly when fully submerged but the easiest to dry/empty. Not much ancle protection
Crocs are unironically not bad for this.
If you want a proper trainer I find the Adidas Ozweegos pretty good. Nice fit, plenty of cushion.
Wearing dese rn
crocks are insainly over priced. they were good when they were $15 a pair because you could absolutely destroy them and not feel bad at all while buying another pair.
There are a million hipster websites that sell laces. REI, moosejaw or even the OEM will sell you laces.
I've never ever broken a round lace.
good ankle support (my foot rolls easily) and comfy
Hanwag Lhasa 2, good shoe
Good shoe for becoming a homosexual. It's the way they ease one into it.
Anyone got any experience with mammut?
I have those exact boots and I can say they're ok. They fit very wide, a bout true to size, maybe slightly bigger because of the width. I ordered the Razorbacks recently and I'm waiting to compare them to the Rangers.
I wear an 8.5 in Oboz Sawtooth II and the 8.5 in the rangers is probably a cm more room in the heel length wise. The other problem is that when you crouch, the tops are a bit slim and they can compress across the top of the foot and toes. 7.5/10 Not bad, not my first choice but they are decent, had to replace insoles.
Just my old tradie boots, nothing special. Solid pair of clean socks.
Got the all leather waxensteins. Toebox scratches alot but they are very comfy. Could be tougher leather though.
I have multiple knots in my shoelaces where they broke and I tied them back together.
these
I used to wear these every day but ghw do you deal with the durability? I had to buy three new pairs every year. At 400 to 600 miles they just go to shit. 
Then I started wearing more durable glued boots, much more cost effective but they wear out your joints on concrete...
Now I'm looking at EVA and air cushioned stitched leather boots. They seem to last 4 to 6 times as long as Quest4Ds and don't grind down your knees as badly as PU-glued boots.
Didn't read
First of all UCP floods al surplus markets, second it is not a 417, its a 556 ar of some sorts based on the mag(Pic rel.) USA is not selling AR-15s to russia, they make them themselves with a little help from Israel

Third, the Gorka was used alot by early war Ukraine. Fourth the camo in the background makes me think atleast the guys in the background are Ukrainians as they used that camo pattern alot longer the Russia
Thankyou, agent McDonald
These ones
Ive worn them a few days at work now, I can feel them starting to break in and they are becoming very comfortable. My primary issue is that the right one looks kinda like a penis with the way the leather is stretched over the composite toe. My coworkers have noticed and started calling them "cockclogs." Not a huge deal and I'll keep wearing them but definitely a tad disheartening.
kek it does look like a big cockhead. get it soaking wet and the leather should loosen up in that area
This isnt the first time ive been recommended to loosen up a bit by getting my cock wet. I'll give it a shot.
That's a really weird boot. What is it for?
Looks like it's made to scare muslim immigrants.

Might need a separate thread
The Phantom picks up fans in the strangest of places
Haix Black Eagle. It's a Bavarian company that specializes on boots for emergency services. They're pretty good.
Forgot pic. That's the mid-height one. Gore-tex layer and rock intrusion protection.
Been wearing these boots for a few months now, theure damn comfy, work, hiking etc. Fitbit reckons im averaging about 14kms a day in them.
Ive ordered a pair and im excited to get them as a messing around shoe. They look like a inbetween of heavyduty boot and sneaker.
I absolutely loved these (for a month) but they are basically disposable.
this pic would be 10x better without your feet in it lol
Depends on your area and terrain. Where I live has some gnarly small cacti that can go through the sole of your boot and even pop car tires if it hits just right, so I wear heavier boots with thicker soles, but there's no reason for them if these cacti aren't a concern. OP, you should have asked for people's region or climate, and what they do /out/ (working, hiking, camping, climbing, etc) for better answers. But a decent boot will do everything you need in at least 80% of situations, so maybe it doesn't really matter much. Probably anything will be fine unless you're doing something extreme, or in an extreme environment. In which case, hopefully you have the knowledge and experience to solve this problem by yourself.
You might look for local outdoors groups or hobby groups for more specific answers for your intentions

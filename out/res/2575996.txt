I accidentally gave myself a black eye this morning that I have been icing for the past couple hours. I was supposed to go camping this weekend and so that got me thinking about what’s the best way to make an ice pack if one isn’t available, such as when you’re camping or just generally out in the wilderness for an extended period of time? Any ideas?
How’d you get the black eye anon?
He bumped into a door.
Right anon?!?
think about the logistics here anon, do you camp with a freezer? bags of salt?
single use chemical cold packs might do the trick, not sure how cold they get though.
Just find a goat.

Haha, that’s actually a lot less embarrassing than the truth. The truth is that I was in a rush this morning when I was putting on my socks and while I was hopping on one leg trying to get one on, I slipped and smacked my face off the tile floor. It’s looking pretty nasty right now.
Kek, let’s see a picture of your eye. I need a good laugh today.
Laugh it up
Are you Polish by chance?
No, but you would probably think that when you look at me right now
hehe your eye looks like a buttcrack
Haha, yeah, it’s not prettiest thing in the world. Luckily it should only be couple more days until my black eye is gone. At least at home I have ice packs, although I might be SOL while camping this weekend.
go to the hospital
Do you really think it’s that bad? I mean, it’s just a black eye. It should be better in a few days.
Frozen water bottles and cold beer dropped into a folded up space blanket.

Since my mom died I wanted to plant tomatoes in her old garden or big pots. Where do I start? I'm retarded when it comes to this stuff, I've been practicing with a storebought parsley plant and most of the stalks have died, but two are hanging on. Please help!
Google
Also go to a local garden center, like a mom &amp; pop type of shop and buy starter plants. If you have any questions the staff will be more than happy to help you and explain
There are many ways but i suggest you get a seed starting tray and p9 pots or 3 inch pots to repot them in. 
Grow tomato seeds in the starting tray untill they show their first 2-4 true leafs. 
what i mean with true leafs, is that the first two leafs you'll see are actually not the real ones, they have the nutrition in them to grow the seedlings to get them started. So again: repot them into the 3 inch pots when they show 2-4 true leafs.
from there you can decide to put them in the ground or keep growing in pots. Make sure you don't overwater. They need frequent, little bits of water in their earliest stages.

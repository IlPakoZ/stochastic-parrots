Seems like even if you live in an apartment and aren't necessarily a construction worker that has to use the bed everyday. They work as the best platform to sleep, haul a bike, campfire wood, and a cooler of ice cold beer. Plus they do great for 98% of off roading that'll get you outside.
Yes, or a large SUV like a 4 runner. I just sold my 2019 Charger Scat Pack and got a 2023 Toyota Tundra Platinum, pic rel. I love it.
He went full retard.
Well actually... Probably won't own if for more then 4 years anyway.. so guess repairs don't mean shit.
No... Whatever is decent on the highway power wise. And whatever gets the best mileage...
no. pickup trucks are good if you need the bed for stuff. if you don't an suv is better. you can just sleep in the suv instead of bringing a tent.
Any smallish vehicle that can pull a small trailer is better IMO.
I hate modern trucks and SUVs they're too cringe.
Nah, I'm gonna own it for a while. Didn't like the idea of having a 7.5% APR loan, so I sold some stocks and paid it off in the first month.
I added a tonneau cover and a decked drawer system to it.
yup
You can sleep in a truck bed.
2016 Toyota tundra extended cab
Got the camper shell last year it takes it to another level. I used to use tote boxes for everything, but now it all stays dry and locked up and secure in the truck bed. Pretty dope. Got two kids and wife, we bring the tent and tons of shit and never run out of space.
adventures are made on your feet, not behind the wheel of some faggy truck you dont even own. put the keys down nigger and go for a walk
How do they perform off road in mud, sand, and your typical forest road perhaps gravel or something similar. Sorta worried about weight distribution and something like a Subaru almost makes more sense.
Buying any pickup newer than the early teens
That isn't marketed towards commercial use
These are mall crawlers that are meant to make you feel like a big boy who's got big toys.
At least taco drivers will bring theirs onto sand once in their lives.
I'll be honest with you. You can do everything you mentioned with a sedan, admittedly not quite as comfortably. A hitch attachment is only a few hundred bucks (less if you diy) and with a small flatbed you can haul pretty much everything you expect to, especially if you go with something rear/all-wheel drive. You may take your truck off-roading once or twice a year, but if you have a $35k vehicle, odds are you don't want it to get scratched up. If you're getting a pickup, get a used one, get one that you won't feel bad beating around innawoods in, don't buy one that makes you look like a suburban dad in a midlife crisis.
A soob is pretty damn capable, trucks just have the brute force of a fuck huge v8 ground clearance and can fit big meaty tires. Just make sure you get 4wd, getting stuck and not having it is a nightmare
I'm the OP to the post you replied too.
I'm glad you paid your shit off. I'm just a mechanic, Toyota engineers been taking notes from Chrysler the last 3/4 years... Also parts.. everything important has a 6 months back order it feels like.
You remember the "chip shortage" bs? Know the parts they made to keep up with demand. That's it.. they didn't make backups for later down the road, they moved on to the next project. 
I would of told you to get a 2019 of some year instead... I don't hate trucks (tho I think to some extent a sedan is a better /out/ car.) 
Anyone reading this. Anything 2020 and up. That was a new body style/engine from its previous years. Stay away... The auto market has a huge quality control issue post covid. 2022 F350s are coming in left and right with dead rear axles.. some as low as 20k but normally 40k and below.. Chevys are seeing bad gasket surfaces. Dodges and their stupid ass half aluminum half Plastic radiators... Oh euro? BMW m3s power steering pumps, pump works. Chip set inside of the pump itself fails randomly throwing error codes. Sometimes putting the car in limp mode.
If you have to buy new- I guess do it. But it's not the cars of old for awhile longer.. you HAVE to do maintenance.. otherwise you won't see 100k.. even on historically reliable brands.
Little protip if you're looking to buy new- most shops use something called Mitchell1 it has manuals and shit for us mechanics. It also has service bulletins for common failures reported. And at what milage.. ask the dealership techs to look into it and see what so far on the car ur looking to get has reported. So you know what to keep an eye on.(buy one lunch even to sweeten the deal on their end..)
2012 Tacoma with a double cab and short bed. 4WD with tow package, of course. I car camp in pretty remote areas on National Forest land and I've found sites that I wouldn't have been able to get to without a truck or jeep. No lift, but I have all terrains and a winch just in case. Haven't gotten stuck so far.
Yeah.
Anything 2020 and up
I'd say 2021, most 2020 model year vehicles were made pre-covid. My '20 Ranger was built Dec '19 and it's arguably the best year for the model, past the first year issues but before covid fuckery.
Curious how do you car camp with the short bed?
Not him, but I got a hammock mount for my truck hitch, I am gonna use that, here is a video of it https://youtu.be/34KYpeG1s20 [Embed]
I'm wondering what all of the options are for stealth camping with a small, sub 5 foot bed. Shorter people can get away with laying diagonal in short beds. I think the best option for taller people is to build a platform in the double cab like this 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSJSTk5TJuU [Embed]
Stealth camping would be harder, you would pretty much have to do what you liked or drop the tailgate and use a bed extender, which wouldn't be as stealthy.
You can get extension tent thingies if you have a shell, or a whole tent that fits in the bed with the tailgate down if you don't. If you really want to go all-in with the overland shit you can run a bed rack with a rooftop tent too. 
Obviously you can just go with the simple solution and set a regular tent up next to the truck as well.
No one else finds it soulless all using Toyota Tacomas? I get they're the king of the midsize trucks but damn no one is making the case to own a Jeep. Honestly if you're going to sleep in your truck, just get a Suburban of sorts. Even maintained forest service roads cant be all that much more challenging that an AWD car cant handle.
stealth camping
Fuck off, Steve
The issue is that anything else deprecates so much, that only a Taco makes sense if you have the $, you get so much back one day. The aftermarket, the universal standard makes it appealing. Not "I'm a special unique person so I buy a weirdo niche and show it through a consumer item" 
Me? I've had compact cars and full size SUVs. Like them both
Eh I could see that to an extent but when everyone in your group of friends has either a 4runner or Tacoma maybe an F150 even it begins to get bland. The overland community loves these trucks for good reason.
I considered a Taco, but when I realized that the Tundra was refreshed last year and had a bunch of nice tech, I went with that. I know it might end up biting me in the ass being an earlier adopter, but it really is comfy as fuck on the inside.
Trucks are shit for OUT. Look at all these boomers posting their clean trucks on paved roads. I did more offroading by the time I was 20 in a 92 Chevy cavalier than most of these retards have done their entire life.
99% of the retards that drive trucks don't need them for what they do.
This anon gets it. Modern trucks are over priced hot garbage targeted at Urban Boomers who use them to commute.
Trucks are shit off road. Hell, trucks are shit ON the road if the road is slightly wet and you're bed is empty. 
Old Jeeps, 4runners or Suzuki Samurais are what the hard core mudrunners use...ironically the Samurais crush.
Lelz you are a huge faggot and your opinions are worth fuck all. Enjoy your Samurai
I have a Ranger. It doesn't hold value like a Taco, but I bought mine used so that was an advantage. It's also superior to the Taco in some ways, for example the payload (which BTFOs other midsizes in off road trim and even some half tons) is a big deal if you want to go crazy with overland kit, it's a better tow rig, better at altitude which is probably relevant if you're in the western half of the US, etc. It's also got a really solid aftermarket since it's an extremely popular truck globally, especially in Australia. 
The bed isn't sleepable without janky solutions but I didn't buy the truck with that in mind.
Yeah, if you wanna get eaten, kek
The problem is the lack of decent SUVs for the purpose, at least in the US. The 4Runner is really the only decent option left and it's an overpriced dinosaur. Everything else is either a gigantic land barge that's designed to be a premium Uber rather than an off roader or it's a Wrangler/Bronco that's good at climbing rocks but shitty for anything else. 
I wish Ford sold an Americanized Everest, it's basically a straight SUV conversion of the Ranger, like what Explorers used to be, and there's a good chance I would've gone with one instead of my Ranger if they'd sold it here.
You can import the Hilux from south American pretty easily. I know a few guys here in Florida who will go to their home countries and buy you one and drive it back for 2k/3k extra. And can be registered here. Now if I can just get someone to help me import a new jimny...
[laughs in power wagon]
What percentage of trailheads do you find you can get to with a compact car?
they're alright but i'm short enough to sleep in my tiny picrel 4x4 diagonal.
pickup trucks are good if you need the bed for stuff
camper tops exist, and also truck bed vs suv roof have a lot of upsides and downsides to consider if you're ever planning an overlanding type build with a popup tent. 
you don't buy a new suv to do offroading and overlanding and shit. you buy something older thats a bit cosmetically fucked and build your offroader/overlander. the newer it is the worse it probably is for offroading. the only exception is if you're saudi oil baron level rich and commissioning some custom gazillion dollar overlander. some of the military auction vehicles euros can get are cool as fuck too. my buddy built a 6x6 unimog ages ago. 
nta but i can get my lowered-but-not-stanced e30 down most trailheads in washington fine. i don't even really pay attention to what car i'm taking on a hike unless someone says its fucked on alltrails. the worst case its ever been is i hike an extra mile or two. 
way back in high school i took my taurus up and down all kinds of pnw mountains and unmarked logging roads going to raves out in the woods, and i took it down a pretty gnarly trail pretty fast running from the cops once. 
you blow up suspension components every once in a while but its honestly not that bad if you don't care about your spine, have a little ride height, and have it on something small like 14's or 15's with old school balloon tires.
the main thing that makes modern cars fall apart and drive like ass the second they're off pavement is the rubber band thin tires and big ass wheels that are trendy right now. if you just put smaller wheels and fatter tires on them and relax the stance a bit they drive fine off road if you can dodge potholes. its just physics. the wheelbase being so short and the car being so narrow makes offroading inherently easier.
muh flashy trucks with no dirt on em
nah some people keep their offroad vehicles clean. i never liked that trope. the local s&amp;r guys here keep their trucks spotless and probably suck each other's dicks about it too. probably don't use them often but it doesn't mean they're not seriously capable builds.
if ur not a car guy here's what to look for to tell if a truck actually gets offroaded:
- it probably has dents/paint damage/rock chips.
- the truck will not have the stock front bumper. if its a diy bumper sven welded up himself, they definitely offroad. if its from a kit its either a higher budget build or a poser. 
offroad vehicles don't necessarily need to have rock bars or an aftermarket rear bumper or a snorkel or anything else really associated with the look.
- probably not an offroad vehicle if its wheels are bigger than 16". if the wheels are aluminum the owner is either serious + richfag or a poser. it probably has all terrains or mud tires on it and if its a real offroader they're probably not xbox hueg.
this isn't always the case, swapping tires and having 2 sets of wheels is a thing. 
- generally not as lifted as ud assume if its not a prerunner/jumper
- just look up what a drop bracket lift looks like, those arent offroaders
- theres more people who imitate the look of an offroad vehicle than ppl who drive offroad vehicles in the wild, especially confirmation bias because nobody drives their offroader on the street
might have missed a thing or two but that's the thought process anyone who knows 'em has when they see one in the wild.
the only exception is**
and hiluxes if foreigners aren't lying about their continued quality
those are actually a new car worthy of offroading but i'd still feel bad fucking it up
End of debate
viscous coupling
It just werks
and if its a real offroader they're probably not xbox hueg
Bigass tires are a necessity for serious rock crawling, they're the only way to achieve appreciable clearance for beam axles.
Rock crawling is more stage play than offroad traveling
Holy shit rangers got huge.
That’s bigger than my 98 f150
Gee whiz! Hostility! Someone needs a Step 2, I'd say
weekend adventure
get a fiat panda, larper
Lel why do pickups invoke so much seethe?
general rules of thumb, i could write an exception for all of them
I can only think of 1 area in death valley that was sketchy to get to, the rest have been fine, including all over big bear at 10,000', Bryce canyon, Moab, Zion.
Get taller sidewall tires over stock. I went with 205 60 R16s recently but wish I went with 215 65 R16s
because out is inherently contrarian and retarded. If you own a truck, you're automatically a suburban boomer who only drives to safeway or starbucks.
the board is basically a whole lot of college kids shitting on everything they see with an autistic black/white attitude
if you don't do _ exactly as i do, you're stupid and wrong.
It's actually slightly smaller, but yeah in general it's the closest thing you can get to a '90s half ton. Trucks have basically gone up a whole size in the last 20 years, F150s now are bigger than late '90s F250s and so on.
you don't buy a new suv to do offroading and overlanding and shit. you buy something older thats a bit cosmetically fucked and build your offroader/overlander.
If it's gonna be a dedicated hardcore rig, sure. Some of us need a daily driver that can do double duty, though, and it's been long enough since real 4x4 body on frame SUVs were common that you have to go pretty old, high mileage, and usually beat to shit or badly modded by previous owners, plus the good stuff is starting to cost stupid money.
The first sentence is correct (factually, not grammatically). The rest of your rant is you being stupid.
Ok boomer. Glad you feel good about that 40k truck you drive to your office job.
I built pic related from frame up about 10 years ago. It's starting to show it's age, so I'm going to make it a little more off road capable on this go around.
Plan to replace the rusting bed with a steel flat bed with built in ramps for loading atv, add a selectable locker in the rear axle, lift it slightly more and bump up to a 35" tire, build steel bumpers with hitch receivers and wire both with power points so I can run a winch at either end. And install the on board air system I've had in my garage collecting dust. Oh and swap in a 5 speed so I can have an OD gear for longer drives
This is the main reason I bought a tacoma. I bought a 2015 model in ~2018 and I can resell it now for roughly how much I bought it for. It's a great multi-use vehicle, since I can move large things in the bed, camp, drive in cities/long distances, etc. I owned a 94 jeep before this, which was obviously better in the offroading niche, but not great at anything else.
In addition to the low depreciation, doing anything offroad will have a lot less wear on something tall vs something short
I'm sorry you're poor, you should probably work on that instead of posting.
?
I'm expressing sympathy that you don't have a lot of money. It may be more helpful for you to focus on improving your financial situation instead of spending time seething on 4chan.
Wait my truck cost 70k....where are yall getting trucks for 40k?
Random idea... Could you buy 7ft or so of culvert pipe, cap off the end with tarp, and use it as a sort of stealth bivvy bag?
But I probably make more money than you my young friend (and own more land, in a better location to boot)
But okay, sounds good
Then why are you seething about people owning trucks
The best /out/ car would probably be a extended cab 8ft truck bed with a camper shell (soft or hard). Unfortunately that is not even made unless you get 1/2 or 3/4 ton pickup. So you will have to settle for double cab tacoma with the 6 foot bed. Any bed shorter than 6 foot is retarded. Just buy a suv/subaru at that point. 4x4 is not required but is nice to have. Now what is necessary is getting a good AT tire like BFG K02 TA or other comparable, if you spend a lot of time off road, then you will need to get some nicer shocks. But that will be all you need.
How feasible would a light offroad motorcycle be for taking to a trailhead? Unfortunately trailhead theft is common enough here that I'm hesitant, but it seems like a cheap way to make it up forest roads with potholes and such. I don't want to buy a new vehicle just to drive up trailheads but my current one makes me scared sometimes.
End of debate
I don't know about that. There's a distinct lack of toyota hiluxes and landcruisers in this thread. It's a shame that utes didn't take off in america, especially diesel single-cabs like the 2006 SR in the picture which is what I drive but with a longer 2.4m steel tray. All these US trucks are a sea of cabin and shiny panels without much room to carry anything. With pic-related you can dump literal shit in the back and scrape it out with an excavator, pitch a tent on it, dump a load of gravel in it. Why don't americans do this?
I’m not? Shit, I own one myself. (98 f150 - good work truck; but ugly)
I was saying the reaction to trucks on /out/ is seething and shit flinging.
OP said weekend adventures. Why are you talking about gravel and dirt loads?
There's a distinct lack of toyota hiluxes
There's a bunch of hilux's ITT they're just in the superior form.
City dweller here, there is plenty of quiet places you can go to in and out of National Parks that are on unpaved and barely maintained roads. Don't hesitate, get a look and plan a little. Be aware of weather conditions and your car's limits. In my case, it's the low clearance and bad traction in loose/wet sand that I have to watch for, so true offroad is kinda off. The important thing is that your /out/ stuff fit in. Might go for something bigger as my next drive, surely not a truck, but this thread is interesting.
Every machine is a compromise in one direction or another. 
20 mpg is a fine trade off for elbow room, a tranquil cabin, shitloads of power and tarrs with a long footprint. 
Got a trunk bigger than a 70's Caddie, throw the wet shit in there and skeedaddle
An suv would work a lot of the time but you can't beat the utilty of the bed.
That white Vadge has hauled most of the material for my buddy's house and shop less the concrete and trusses.
You feel better about the absurd cost of big tires when people start smacking the cutbank. I was too busy not crashing to take pics but we saw four or five cars and trucks stuck in the rough on that morning.
Extended cab short beds look fucking retarded, but you're a tripfag so it checks out.
Tripfags can get gassed but that's a crew cab, not extended, and that's a nice looking rig whether you like the short bed or not.
Get one of the Japanese 650s. DR XR or KLR. They have the gearing for long distance highway travel and good enough suspension to navigate any fire road and some lighter trail riding. Get panniers, windscreen and a high capacity tank, you can go anywhere
highway travel on a 650 single cyclinder
Fuuuuck that, I have places to be.
The only thing that pile is good for is bombing wheelies, since the entire garage sale on the bitch seat helps counterbalance the 23 hp
What they lack in horsepower, they make up for in weight. 
My 525 will do highway speeds pretty easily. And it's ~270lbs. 
While I prefer my 1190 if I'm on the highway for any extended amount of time (power aside, it's a LOT more comfortable ride), I don't mind jumping on the smolbiek.
The snow is almost gone nagroes, a fwd car with a skidplate and decent tires can get down most dirt roads, just Bahonda it. 
You still can't make it to the best campsites but you shouldn't be that far from a starcucks anyways.
a fwd car with a skidplate and decent tires can get down most dirt roads,
you have never driven outside of a city
That's a sick pic and a sweet bike.
Forgive me for doubting that weight number, is that claimed by ktm or have you weighed it?
Either way I hate getting wind blasted on highway miles, I have a Husq 610 (actual displacement 576 cc), it weighs 300 wet and makes about 55 hp, but no fairing makes for uncomfy highway miles. 
I put it in my truck and only unload it for the choice roads. If I have distance to cover I borrow a frend's MT10 or his ZX10, I like to lay waste to long straights, step off with my hair standing on end, blurred vision and high blood pressure.
Kek, I lived the entire 90s off grid in NE Shasta county in the sticks and mud. 
My prelude could climb mud hills that were shutting down yota 4wds, and outrun them with ease in shallow snow. My frend Jim's early Accord (called the Ba-honda) would do amazing shit, carry speed and slide over huge logs and rocks. 
We all drive capable trucks but fucking around with beaters in the woods is a good time, don't knock it till you try it.
My prelude could climb mud hills that were shutting down yota 4wds
Ok buddy.
Take it or leave it, idgaf. Wide sticky tires and vtech yo, that car had big balls and could get it on. The yotas of the day couldn't generate any wheelspeed, and the 'Lude had a a good LSD. 
You have never seen such butthurt as a jilted yotafag with a new 4runner that couldn't climb the learner paragliding hill at Igo Ono.
The cartroons are short on venom when pics get poasted, why is that
Off-roading in a prelude
Unfathomable based. I live on the Olympic Peninsula and one of the baddest off road cars around is a 1980 caprice some dude jacked up. Cheap as fuck rust bucket with perfect weight distribution. Most other off roaders drive old 4runners or tacomas. You also see a few jeeps and Suzuki safaris but what you almost never see is full sized trucks...if you do see full sized trucks they are usualy towing the off-road vehicle.
Kek, he's mogging on all kinds of rigs, can't capiche the Caprice.
Fool size is fun until the trail gets peenchy or you sink it, then you need a fuggin crane to get it out.
I don't want to shit up the board with another thread so I'll ask here
I'm thinking of taking my truck up to Alaska and overlanding for a month. How rough is the Dalton Hwy? I've got a '19 Colorado and a couple of extra tires. I don't do a lot of offroading but occasionally I'll scamper off out into the desert or some PNW Forest Service roads.
Is it worth the investment to skidplate the underside of the truck for general fucking about?
You don't need skids, the Dalton isn't particularly rough but you will have to endure some nasty adhesive mud. Skidplates might be nice just to keep your underside cleaner, and to deter the fawkin cat thieves.
That truck should handle whatever you aim it at no problemo.
He's a welder and an auto mechanic... he basically redid the suspension and transmission. It's never gotten stuck. Dude took it in mud over the hood and the thing kept going (it has a snorkel lmao)... Its really rather amazing. He did it as a joke and the thing just fucking crushes.
The diameter of the tire has nothing to do with traction, retard. My ford fiesta is better in the snow than your retarded boomer truck... literally EVERY compact front wheel drive car is better than EVERY full sized truck on snow covered roads.
That graphic is all fucked up like a soup sammich. 
The G wag and the fool size suv should be moved to the top, and the rest of them, who cares.
I'm aware that new f150s are boomer tier trash, you should have seen my boomer dad when I showed him mine- the wheels were turning and he was five minutes from ordering one up before his inner jew took over and he decided that his 300k miles f150 still works fine. He really likes the 360 cameras lelz
Ahaha! Tell us another one fluffy

New Jeeps are Boomer trash made by Fiat, retard. The Wagons were never ever good--shit transmissions, shit motors, crap electrical systems. 
Full sized SUV's are crap at every level.
Heavy, wide, shit gearing off road, unreliable. 
The list is what is common across three Washington, Idaho and Oregon according to mudders. The people with big truks don't drive them off road...and there aren't many jeeps older than a few years old because they all fucking broke down because they were never ever good.
Only if you use your words next time... I understand comprehensibility isn't you're good at but do try to use your words to make some sort of coherent point next time.

Has this complicated suspension yet ride is shit, suspension travel is abysmal, no flex at all, v8 engine that is so anemic it can't spin tires in low range when bogged.

i drove through a ~50 car pileup on i5 in this kind of weather on a stanced wrx on bald rubber band thin summer tires. i followed some tow truck 5mph all the way to oregon and it turned out that just driving a reasonable speed made a bigger difference than the type of vehicle i was stuck driving (it wasn't my car, and i had to take over because the driver didn't know how to drive on ice, i was planning on sleeping)

Steep driveways, plow berms, can't park off the road. It's always some scoobaru homo that's parked blocking the removal equipment. And you never see em helping another vehicle get out.
Altruism for the ditch magnets is the truck's prerogative.
Driving on snow in the flat is easy with All-Seasons. Driving up a mountain to 11000' wasnt even a challenge except going UP steep climbs from low speed. Descending down though, yeah that's where your tires are everything... Going slow worked for me but there was a steep downhill corner I lost control. No crash, quickly recovered, but realize "going slow" isn't a fix. AWD is a meme for cars. Probably needed on 4000lbs crossovers and 5000lbs pickups.

I want to throw a hard top tent on my tacomas bed rack
I’ve done a lot of shitty camping for my job, so I want to do some glamping for myself.
Does anyone have any recommendations for RTTs? For hard tops, is clamshell or pop up better?

about to graduate from grad school
great job lined up with comfy salary 
between clearing out loans and attending to responsible financial decisions (buying a house, laying the foundations of a stock portfolio etc) and starting a family I wont be able to get a decent truck for ~5 years at best 
I've wanted a new truck since I turned 18, ground my way through undergrad and lawschool thinking about the day I get to buy one. I've made all the "right" decisions, embraced delayed gratification, and now I realize its still well out of reach. It hurts real fucking bad bros. 
Redpill me on 2nd hand trucks that have 80-120K miles on the clock. I presume its just tundra's and Tacoma's that are worth going for?
nissans are still ok. stay the fuck away from any north american made truck, they are such piles of shit
What is maintenance on a track vehicle
I was thinking Toyota because not only the reliability and cheap parts, but because they are easy to work on AND there is a big market for none OEM parts
120k is nothing for a maintained truck.. remember truck transmissions are not CVT... 
Even a non abused 5.3 with a 4L60e will see 250k miles without issue. (4L60e is a good transmission as long as you don't throw more power at it than it was designed for... Go figure)

pre 90s full size truck
use a GMT400 for the picture which ran from 1988-1998
three full size SUVs in different ranks outside of the "Any full sized SUV" category 
Whoever made this list has room temperature IQ.
Why are all modern trucks so big?
I'm not talking about bed size, the bed size seems the same.
They all seem too far off the ground and way too big and bulky.
I love older trucks from like the 80s and shit.
Safety
Or more specifically, safety (((rating)))
Also profit margins are higher on bigger/more expensive trucks. having a smaller ranger/s10 sized truck available cuts into sales of f150s or silverados. Yet another sign that credits been way too cheap for too long.
I fixed your list
Hey now, im not a hipster i just really like the look of the 2nd gen wagons.
bought my first truck last year
'88 dodge ram 50
Respectable Tier
nice
Updated the list to include more things:
I like the look of all of the hipster tier cars, but I can't argue with the demographics of the other people who usually buy them.
Those first gen Rams are legendary. There's multiple cases of those trucks going over a million miles.
Those first gen Rams are legendary. There's multiple cases of those trucks going over a million miles.
Fuck that's exciting to hear, I liked the old ones because they're smaller and the one I got only had 70k miles on it
Fisherman reporting in: move fishing boats (especially bass boats) to boomer tier. Only boomers are insane enough to spend $50k+++ for a fucking bass boat. Kayaks should be put in respectable tier.
Everything else is spot on, damn good job anon.
Idk, why did cars and trucks in the early 2010's suddenly go from 90% being 4 to 5 star safety ratings to suddenly only 15% being 4 to 5 stars? Why did full-size trucks suddenly go from V8's to twin turbo V6's? Why are midsize trucks all turbo 4 cylinders now? 
It's not hard to figure out why trucks became bigger, why cars became bland in design, and why everything is insanely more expensive compared to 20 years ago.
Wranglers and Subarus in same tier discredits this entire list. I was going to sperg about the Xterra but that's icing on cake
And lol Ford Explorer? Man times have changed. I got so much shit for a lift+ tires on my 2003 yet took that thing everywhere
Way too many old pieces of shit
New cars are not bad
Old cars are bad and will leave you stranded in the middle of the desert of national park
ford explorers are fine, until that timing needs to be changed/repaired. then you mind as well throw it in the trash, cause ain't nobody paying 60 hours labor + materials to repair that shit. and if you think you're doing it without pulling the fucking motor... HAHAHAHAHAHA okay.
Boat Tier list
S tier
12/14' John Boat with 10hp/20hp 
old solid fiberglass center console [no wood stringers/core] 
Kayak- paddles/small electric outdrive
Respectable Tier
Cabin cruisers/runabouts [only for northern states]
Skiffs
older 25-35' Fishing boats [for deep sea fishing] Inboard/dual outboard
Mid tier
Kayaks with pedal drive. they're just dorky.
Anything foam core like a boston whaler. "IT CANT SINK!" as it cracks in half and floats away in two pieces.
Gheenoe or any large 14' Canoe with a small outboard
hipster tier
any paddle boards or paddleboard shaped boats with small outboard on the back
basic tier
Pond Prowler things, anything thats manually powered and near impossible to actually move. 
Boomer trash
Yachts
Wakeboats
old 80s "MUH TWO STROEK" Jetskis
Cigar boats
Anything with more then 2 outboards off the back.
Zoomer trash
Anything fully electric over 14'
those clear kayaks
new Jet-skis.
$50k 17' center consoles.
anything you seen pulled by a BMW/Brand new truck that can't backup an empty trailer on the ramp. 
sailboats - have to put this in zoomer trash because all the popular sailing channels are zoomer bait.
Wrenchlet detected, opinion ignored
Updated again, sorry in advance if something pisses you off. 
Nice, you made a good investment buying it if the mileage is that low. Hopefully it will last you a long time.
Thanks for all of the ideas, I think I was able to include most of what you mentioned. Boating isn't my expertise, so let me know if something doesn't fit the caption.
Mid and respectable aren't that far apart and the rank isn't an indictment on the Explorer. I tried to limit each brand to 2 in each tier for balance. Explorers are great SUVs in my opinion, but Rangers and Broncos have almost universal praise and have a higher proportion of people using them as dedicated off road vehicles. JK/JL Wranglers are in basic with new Subarus because for every 1 Wrangler sold to drive off-road, 5 are sold as gifts for someone's 16th birthday. Modern Subaru Crosstreks/Outbacks is just a case of 1 off-road/10 Whole Foods parking lot.
New cars are too unremarkable to describe in detail on this list.
but I can't argue with the demographics of the other people who usually buy them.
Thats fair, i myself can ignore them quite easily since im not retarded enough to live near the west coast/mountains
Pickup trucks are often LARP. People can steal things from them and of all the things that can fit in the tray most need tiedowns or whatever.

You people make me laugh with your bloated cars. Lada Niva, toyota tercel 4wd is all you need. A car you can trust and repair ez
It’s not made to haul ass. It’s made to get from point a to point b reliably. Sure there are “better” options, you can get an 1190 ADV R, a T7, or a GS1250. Dude was asking for a light off-road bike to take to a trailhead. I mean if you’re gonna haul a bike to the trailhead and ride out from there, just get whatever trail or mx bike tickles your fancy at that point. I see GS boomers going at a snails pace on the easiest of fire roads because of how fucking heavy their bikes are
I'm >>2564063 thanks for the info! Will definitely be considering this. Looks like the right mix in terms of highway compatibility and trail-friendliness.
Forgive me for doubting that weight number, is that claimed by ktm or have you weighed it?
Fuel, oil, coolant, fork oil, skid plate and accessories on, GPS on the bars, ready to ride, as it sits in my garage right this moment.
1190's closer to 600 but I haven't rolled that onto a scale yet. It's a fat pig, but it handles the weight surprisingly well offroad. Even my sleds are about 100lbs lighter than that bike.
LMC on the left weighs about as much as my pickup.
tfw work dirt bike
throw a canopy on it and sleep in the back, 6ft bed, light weight, easy to maintain.
That's a good weight, I bet that bike is a ripper. My frends are trying to get me to buy an "adv" bike, but everything seems too porky. I want a 150 hp bike at 400 lbs, sheeeeit
Don't project your skid aversion onto me
Imagine not loving your truck. 
You'd have to be a dead soul tranny.

Not a truck, boomer piece of shit. Again, overly built luxury vehicle but has a bed for MUH WORK that you never do. Neck yourself.

As she finishes her cake, then takes a bite from mine
Was considering picking up this 2010 Ford F-150 FX4 for ~15K$ CAD. It's got 155000km on it. Thoughts?
Mileage is low enough, should be a good rig if it's been maintained.
...That escalated quickly.
also,
Top kek
Newer midsize trucks ought to be on there somewhere, we've got a bunch of Colorado/Ranger/Frontier guys around. The Taco should also probably have a cutoff year because the legendary reliability went out the window when they changed engines. (Not to mention they've always had frame problems but god forbid you mention those around Taco fans.)

I don't know what Hart Cellar or Bretton Woods is.
I mean, you’re not wrong (hart-celler in particular) but that was 19 fucking 65.
And besides, that was pushed through without any kind of vote by citizens. 
Just like immigration amnesty, the ACA or any other vile bullshit of the past decade or two.
Just wait to see what your generation gets blamed for
We're already made to feel guilty over the holocaust, slavery and colonialism so what
We're derailed, trucks and bikes are the bitching target
Law changes take time for the impacts to be felt by human standars... that's how they got away with it.
The impact wont be noticed... for 40 years lel
After that it's irreversible and obvious
I don't feel bad about either of those things. No white person should. The only guilt I have is that the US fought on the side of the communist Bolsheviks instead of the Christian nationalists. The biggest problem with the holocaust is it never happened.

Turd gen reporting
Probably a Van is better.
Like, you can store a lot of shit inside of it without the fear of rain or getting it stolen.
Also, I would prefer to sleep inside a van rather than a pick up bed.
No, if you want a weakend adventure you are 2 chad options, that are cheap and do exactly what you need. 
Option 1) The duel sport bike with 20/80 tires. You can get a rack, and saddle bags and pack easy 40L of gear, or even up to 80L if you adjust your spring and go literally fucking ANYWHERE you have the ability to ride. If you are a big boy you can get a 650, and keep your sell on logging trails and well troden paths, if you are a skilled rider you can even take harder single trail tracks to get inna woods, just dont drop your bike, a 650+Gear is a heavy bitch. Or get yourself a little DRZ400 and load it up with either 40 or 80L and more or less have a dirt bike, with blinkers, gonna be slower on the highway unless you mod it with a smaller sproket and or hot cams but then you are also scrificing low end torque. 
Option 2) Get your self an old CJ5 or CJ7, learn how to work it.get a cable winch, Hi lift jack, and a spare tire and go out in it. You can easy load up all your gear into it that you would ever need for a weekend and longer even. 
A bike will run you easy under 7k, like 4k for a DRZ, Jeep will run you a bit more, probably closer to 10k.

You've never driven a 4runner off road or in deep snow if you think that. The weight distribution is totally different. Any 4runner older than a 2003 has a completely different feel than any truck... anything past a 2003 4runner is shit not worth arguing about.
if i cant find it on google then it never existed
that spot looks very familiar. Great truck by the way.
Nodwell's are pretty fun too.
Im not European, but also Im not the target of the autojews selling you an outdooorsy lifestyle via pick up marketing.
Also, Last year I rode in a van with another 12 persons and all our gear in a single van, and then proceed to climb up to 5000 meters, probably you couldnt do that with a pick up
Motorhome, with a small trailer or just a tongue mounted motorcycle mount. 
turns like a school bus- but at least doesn't turn like a semi truck.
Only need insurance for one thing.
Cheapest new motorhome RN is like 100k.
RV/truck combo gonna have you sitting WELL above that. 
don't need to struggle parking for gas in smaller gas stations. and parking in general is actually easier. 
Arguably more comfortable to drive a motorhome then any seats chevy/ford are cranking out the last 15+ years.
depending on what you get, easier to replace 6 tires, then 8. or if your RV is too big you're pulling a with a dually- 10 even.

Calm down 
off-road Americans don't actually drive big trucks
this isn't too far off
Truck bed camper limits you the least but is the least comfy, you can take a camper almost anywhere your truck can go.
A trailer means your truck can die without you losing your bed, a huge positive if you're living out of it.
RVs are for renting if you don't own either of the others and want to road trip.
You're a rare one anon. Good eye and thanks for the great photo.
All I have is an early Hetch Hetchy but it'll have to do.
probably you couldnt do that with a pick up
Thats a point in favor of pickups...
It was supposed to be taken near Daytona
Lol go ahead and explain how you came to that conclusion.
Are pickup trucks the best vehicle for weekend adventures?
No. That would be a minivan or SUV.
is a good thing that a more expensive vehicle intended to cargo things, has less cargo capacity
Because the IZOD 2 seater, which that car is, gives rides at the Indy 500 event. The place to find that car with Mario Andretti is the indy 500.
That park doesn't exsist in florid--or anywhere in the USA. Prove ,e wrong: protip, you cant.
Added those as well as some airplanes. There's still some room before the final version.
Depends, I would say yes if you were referring to a Hilux, Dmax or Navara but no if you're talking about one of those massive fuck off RAM f150s. The smaller utes are better for a number of reasons and their also proven reliable. Also those SUVs like Nissan Patrols or Land Cruiser 80s are pretty good too. I prefer utes more because I use the bed more. 
It's the trend from America. Just like the people spending thousands of dollars the convert right hand drive RAM f150s to left hand drive so they're road legal.
It's one of the smaller trucks. Most people riding dirtbikes on trails have them on cars, do you think people going to Whistler pedal there?
I also have a few colorized shots too from Western Mining History. Lovely looking territory.
Under no circumstances buy a KLR and only buy a XR650l if most of your riding is actually offroad. Aircooled, low oil capacity, and no cush drive sucks
cush drive sucks
all cush drive is is rubber shit under the sprocket anon.. legit does nothing to hinder performance a regular ass rider would notice..
if i cant find it online it doesnt exist
Best /out/ vehicle coming through.
This. I take my Toyota yaris to stupid places. I take it on forest roads and deep in the bad lands up north and out west in the USA. It handles most things that you want, while being cheap as hell to maintain. No, I can't get everywhere. No, I'm not taking kids. I'm going out west and getting as deep into shit as I can. It handles most of Missouri and Arkansas fine. There's some places I run into that need clearance. That's my limiting factor. 
From central Illinois to North Carolina, to Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, this dumb hatchback has handled it all with very minimal repairs. I've had to build up and modify my path at times but as long as you don't fall into ruts or ditches you just keep going. 
If I can do all this shit with a yaris I don't know what's stopping anyone else.
Foreigner doesn't understand what NPS does
lol, ok, so you live in central/south America or Africa.
Its job poorly, it does its job poorly
DoD is surplussing all the HMMWVs and other shit. If you don't care about the dismal fuel economy, they can be had for under $10k thru govplanet.com

Comprehensive af, nice going.
decommissioned military helicopters
Says the guy living in the third world surrounded by people hell bent on cutting down rainforest only limited by their primitive tools.
NPS is good at paperwork: especially concerning tracing income and expenses. If it's a national park--it's listed.
Stat Parks and Recreation tracks local parks and there is a national orginisation they all align with. There is also the NRPA which works with parks and rec.
So, again, you can't prove it exists and you can't.
But reeee prove a negative reee

Small edit to label hoverboards
Thank you, I tried to fit as much as possible
This debate is pointless because each person's needs, wants, and abilities are going to differ.
For many people a truck may be just fine for the type of offroading they do, or hell even awd pos s.u.v
others need to be able to navigate tight, rocky, steep inclines, and do real hardcore rock crawling, which require short wheelbase, good departure break over and approach angles, high clearance vehicle with locking diffs and 4 to 1 low. On technical trails like Johnson Valley, the vast majority of pick up trucks would get gaped. If all you're doing is mudding, then fine, drag a stock Tacoma through. 
Then there are people who are better serviced by atv dirt bikes and dual sports as they will be riding very tight trail or single track.
Then there are people with pick up truck beds that are 4 feet; pathetically small, useless, then there's 8 foot beds you can sleep in, with camper installed you will be super comfy, lik a mini cabin. Then you have folks trailering, both on road and offroad trailers. the possibilities and terrain is endlessly varying and only you an decide what's best.

Hopefully in 5 years time I will be ready to get sailing yacht and fuck off. Either that or travel over my country to the remote regions. Don't know how I'm going to make this happen.
You can have those same experiences in the future if you have the motivation.

Why is there never a hunting thread? I don't spend a hell of a lot of time on 4chan anymore so maybe I'm missing out on something but I figured I'd start a hunting thread. Post this year's successes etc. 
Pic is my first turkey. Elusive creature.
Nice tom. We hunt, which you know already because I've seen your picrel before. I've been hunting rabbits this winter but I don't take pics of them.
Yeah desu rabbits are too cute for me to hurt. Gods honest truth. Here is a black duck from this past season. Unfortunately he was too damaged to mount so I ate.
Where do you even find turkeys like that? All the ones I see look like overgrown roadrunners.
How often do you down something with worms/parasites? Is it a lost cause when you find them? Or just cut around it? I know heat will kill whatever it is but do you just say fuck it and then eat the dead parasites?
This was in south carolina 
If I can tell it's a parasite I remove it lol. I'd assume I accidentally eat them plenty tho desu
Here is the deer I got this year. I believe I may have posted it a while back.
Does anyone bowhunt? I'm a poorfag and want to start bowhunting because I'm noguns due to mental health reasons. My cousin and I got some good compound bows and arrows dirt cheap off craigslist. We practiced a few times then he he moved away and gave me his bows and equipment. Pic related is the best of my 3 bows, the other 2 are an ancient Bear Archery Whitetail Master and a Whitetail Master Chinese knockoff from Amazon. They're all in good condition. 
I know the basics but I don't have a hunter's safety certificate yet. I've had bowhunter chads for bosses and coworkers and I want to be like them. They all started when they were kids and I've never hunted before, I just fish a lot. Wish I had bowfishing gear because there's a huge carp spawn ever year in my favorite hole.
On a side note I also want to sell furs and other parts that I collect. Any opinions or advice from bowhunters is appreciated.
I dont know much at all about bow hunting but I've learned a large amount of what I know about hunting and fishing from YouTube. If you can ask it, someone has probably made a video about it haha. My brother is completely self taught in bow hunting.
Is hunting teal more similar to duck or dove?
Im done hunting dove and need something to replace my hunting time
I know "how" to hunt but I've never gone hunting so I don't know how you're supposed to do all this license and tag shit
So in many (all?) states you will have to take a Hunters education class. Usually takes a day. Then just purchase the types of licenses you need at the agency, a Walmart, or many bait/hunting stores. Keep in mind for migratory birds like ducks or geese you will need (all)
1. Your state hunting license
2. State migratory bird license 
3. Federal duck stamp (probably not available on your state agency's website, Google Federal duck stamp).
This is not legal advice
If you can ask it, someone has probably made a video about it haha.
Thanks anon, I've watched a few youtube videos on bowhunting. It's sort of helpful, but most videos are made my people who grew up bow hunting. I did meet a guy once, who blew every other bow hunter I've ever met out of the water. The guy had a whole storehouse of full-body taxidermy mounts from every big game species in North America and beyond. He said when he was 14 he saw mounts in a magazine and thought, "I want to have those, too", so he started bowhunting. My own reasons aren't to keep trophies, but to participate in a tradition older than civilization.
I suppose if I want an authentic pre-civ experience I should just jump in, make mistakes, and adapt (while remaining law abiding, of course).
Like this anon said >>2567372
Hunting lawfully means obtaining required license, but don't worry too much about cost or having to wait because literally all it takes is spending $10-$30 on a hunter's safetycourse and if you already know how to hunt that part's a breeze. After that, licenses are basically just to prove your name is on the books so the DNR knows how many people are hunting and what not. Tags are for info regarding where certain kinds of game are being taken. For this reason most DNR and even retailers will be happy to explain the process to you, because that is literally their job. Call a DNR center and odds are there will be someone who can tell you what do get based on what you want to do.
Want to hunt deer? Buy a deer hunting license
How many deer do you think you'll bag this season? Okay get 2 tags
Will you hunt for bucks and/or does? You want an antlered and/or an antlerless tag."
Stuff like that.
It seems daunting because it's unfamiliar territory. Remember that the people who manage the industry want you to hunt so they can keep their jobs, so they'll answer questions as best they can. I hope this helps.
Forgot to mention that licenses cost anywhere from $0 if you're a Amred forces member or Veteran, to around $3 for something like geese, to around $50 for bear once you've entered an application since bear is a tightly controlled species.
wanna go recurve bowhunting
too weak to pull 40-50lbs even after months of practice and working out
Any bowhunters here?
How long did it take you guys to reach decent draw weight? 
I dont wanna be stuck to rabbits
I'm a bowhunter. I started archery with a 20# recurve when I was 10 and developed the musculature to draw a 50 pound recurve when I was 26, so it took me 16 years. I wasn't really trying to get to 50# until I was about 23, but because I'm a thin dude it was still a lot of work to get to the point at which I could easily draw, anchor, and release that weight. By the time I turned 35 I was having chronic shoulder pain. To put this in context, I was also rock climbing pretty hard through my 20s and could do easily do 30 pull ups, so I was as fit as anyone. I ended up dropping my draw weight to 40# and still easily pull that with a recurve, but now I hunt with a compound. If you seriously get into archery you must go slow with draw weight increases or risk injuring your shoulder. A 40# recurve is plenty for deer, but I'd only take a shot on an elk if I was 15 yards or less with a broadside shot. Go slooow.
Good to know its not a case of me just being exceptionally weak. I was also doing a bit of compound shooting for a while but for some reason i can never settle with one, something is always needing adjustment or breaking or making me feel like im holding a missile with a hair trigger.
But it does seem like it will have to be the way to go till I can work up my recurve poundage.
My 5'2" Asian gf was able to pull a 40 pound recurve after a month of practice. I got up to 45 at the same time and stayed there since I'm not hunting big game, but I could easily move up to 50-55 if I wanted to. How often are you practising? We generally went 2-3 times per week for an hour each session and moved up about 3 pounds each session - 6 arrows per round, take breaks as needed.
Your injury might be caused by poor form. Most people don't know how to release properly and end up with chronic problems after a few years of having their shoulder snap back in an unnatural position a few thousand times.
I lost my job so the dilema is whether or not I should pursue turkey season. On the one hand, I have all the time in the world. On the other hand I should probably spend that time job hunting. Also being Amerishart means I got no health insurance atm so if I should be so unlucky as to get Cheynee'd in the woods it'd be bad. What would you do anons?
Pursue a new job instead.
Find a new job but tell them your start date will have to be in two months due to an obligation you've got to see through at your current one.
Dont listen to the fags below. Which one will feed your soul more?? Getting another slave position aka (((job))) to generate currency for the central banks, or to go out and get meat? To get within 40 yards or closer to a wild animal and close the deal, as our ancestors have done with various weapons for millions if years??
On your deathbed, which one will you regret not doing
Unplug from (((the matrix)))
Gonna go turkey hunting again in the morning. Hopefully I can make it happen haha
No jakes, it's tom or bust
Man I miss Cope, why it's gotta be almost $7 a tin now?
bump
This weekend is new moon, I'm going out to find some bunnies with my new PCP air rifle. Last time I got one was in october.
It costs the same your money is just worth less now 
Dont think of the price as rising
Think of your wallet as sinking
Buckshot?
Word
As someone who's never hunted before, is there a progression of some kind y'all would recommend? I want to ideally hunt deer and elk regularly, primarily for food, pelts, antlers, etc... But I also know that processing game is an acquired skill that requires space (that I don't have) and time (that I have but probably not enough). Idk, getting into hunting for food/resources advice?
What state? Do you have access to private hunting land or will you be primarily public land?
Beginner hunter here. Is a 357 magnum marlin rifle effective enough for deer hunting? I don't intend on firing beyond i'll say 30-50 yards. I just want something that's simple and easy enough to handle.
Yes.
Yes but perhaps if you're not going more than 50 yards follow my lead and get a double barrel 12 gauge like a cz bobwhite g2. I hunt literally everything with it.
Are pellets a hassle to extract from game?
Not really. Sure I have a few to remove from ducks etc but it's really not a big deal. Rifle projectiles shatter too. It isn't prohibitive
I agree, after some thought I figure I'd go with that instead. Thanks for the suggestion.
Hell yes. I love proselytizing about the g2 lol
Make sure you dont accidentally buy the left handed one unless you're left handed lol
How well are the barrels regulated?
How many western hunters here are sitting on a pile of points that they'll never use? Fuckin cash em in already. You're gonna be 250 years old before you have enough to hunt your dream unit.
I'm not sure but iirc it's at 40 yards. Don't quote me on that I am not a sales rep lol
Do any of you have that webm of the turkey getting shot near a decoy?
The one where everyone replies to with "he didn't even flinch" and stuff like that
I remember seeing one shot with a bow that just severed its head in one shot and it laid there for a couple seconds blinking. Looked brutal but it's as humane of a harvest you can get almost.
Do any anons turkey hunt on or around the Canadian shield? Historically wild turkey never used to venture up that far north, but their territory now seems to go well into the Kawarthas and even all the way up to Algonquin and the Parry Sound region. I see them by chance on road sides once in a while when I'm up there, but the problem is I have no idea where to actively look for them since it's not their typical environment with big open fields for them to graze.
Yes I have killed two deer with my 357 Rossi 92. If you hunt woodland it's very effective inside 100yd and the noise and recoil is low. I oberseve some deer don't even run when shot they just kinda jump and keep on walking falling over dead 10 steps later. They don't do the death speed run like larger calibers.
I was thinking about picking up a bob white since I want a shotgun of every type. I picked up a yildiz o/u from academy and it's been great. How does the bob white hold up? How long have you had it?
Most go straight thru small game imo but I never hunted ducks. Squirrels and doves it's all of thru if you use anything bigger than 7
Got this little nigga in November, good eating... Want to look for a black bear in the next few weeks
I've hunted deer, ducks, and turkey with it. Been all thru the swamps in freezing rain etc. Never had a problem with it. I love it, desu it's my favorite gun and I'm very glad I got it. Comes with 5 chokes.
Noice. Pic rel is similar to the yildiz I got. Haven't used it as hard as you but I'm also quite happy with it. Might pick up a bob white just to round out the collection.
Buckshot or slugs for durr?
Is he going to be okay?
Kek, I have a 200 yd zero and he was 201 yards away... It ended before he knew
Is there any risk of accidentally blowing the deer's lower jaw off on a 200 yard head shot?
I use buckshot. The only choke that I can fire a slug thru is the widest one I can't remember what it's called off the top of my head.
Yes, I don't usually take headshots. This was my first and last
Why is there never a hunting thread?
Because it's spring.
oh but it is, anon. it’s time for spring thunder. and hogs are always there for the taking.
Why is there never a hunting thread?
My guess would be because most people don't hunt small game and the season for popular shit like Turkey, White Tail and Waterfowl don't last that long.
That being said I do love me some squirrel hunting
It's literally spring turkey all over the country right now, and spring turkey is the longest of all the turkey seasons. Haven't been out there since I been unemployed and focusing on getting a job, fug.
Hello hunters of /out/.
I assume you are the ones most familiar with laws surrounding hunting, therefore I want to ask you;
Is killing a saltwater crocodile illegal?
I know in Australia it is, but they also live in India and SEA. Maybe Africa?
Also, what's the best gun to take down a croc without having to come in the danger zone, i.e. excluding shotguns?
Is killing a saltwater crocodile illegal?
it depends the jurisdiction you are in and if you can't find info on it, its probably illegal. Call/email whom ever issues tags and permits in whatever jurisdiction you live in.
but they also live in India and SEA. Maybe Africa?
Again it depends where you plan to hunt them
Also, what's the best gun
the best gun
I have a feeling you really shouldn't be asking this question and I am not going to spoon feed you on this subject. If people hunt and trap them there most likely is a repository of info that you should be looking into anyway. Hunting is not walking out in the wilderness and popping a random animal, you need to be able to field dress it, how are you getting it back? those crocs weight a lot, can you humanely dispatch it? If you are asking "what is the best gun" I would wager you don't even know where you should be aiming when you shoot it and you shouldn't be hunting it to begin with. Be honest Anon are you just looking to shoot a crocodile? because thats what this sounds like.
are you just looking to shoot a crocodile?
No, I'm planning to fuck it... Ofc I'm looking to shoot a crocodile, but my reasons go beyond just sport and pleasure.
where you should be aiming when you shoot it
So that it doesn't get a chance to crawl back into the swamp, the head is the best bet. Head = spine/brain behind the eyes.
you need to be able to field dress it
I wouldn't be the one to do that. I reckon their skin is quite different, and I don't want to mess it up, so I'd have a professional do it. The hide is one of my main motivations, so I'm taking no chances with it.
I wouldn't be going alone, at least a crew of 4, including a local guide/hunter. Get someone to set up bait too.
the best gun
Asking because I geniuenly don't know what the best gun for the job is. Their hide is definitely tougher than a deers, and shotguns are a no-go for sure. I'm searching for something that can take it down at 100 or 200 yards.

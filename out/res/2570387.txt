one bad thing about going /out/ in paths that ppl usualy don't go is them 
ants
spiders 
ticks 
flies
bees 
those fuckers can get us pretty bad
usually hike trails with a friend or two
always tell them to lead because I like to "hang back and check out cool plants or animal tracks"
none of them have realized it's to clear out spider webs for me
the ones that get behind get all the bites of ants and bees brah ! 
spiders very rarely bite someone
I've never had a problem with bees, but ant hills are usually easy enough to avoid if you're paying attention. I just don't like getting spider webs all over my face.
Ants
some of them are actually really tasty, tastes like lemon, and i will frequently eat them on breaks if i see the right kind of anthill, dont like the larvae though
spiders
hmm, dont really have a story, threw one at a girl when i was a kid, does that count?
i had one on my balls once 0/10 would not recommend, found the "forbidden caviar" once though, that was neat
flies
are flies even polinators or do they just fly around eating shit all day? also, arent they what bring Cryptosporidium to some water sources? besides literal shit ofcourse
bees
they cool, but i accidentally hung my hamock over a rotten stump once and the next morning i hit it with my axe and it turned out to be the lair of Doctor Bees and he was very angry, so i bravely ran away
i think leeches are oddly cool too, used to collect them in a bucket and put them on my fingertips and waggle them at my mother to scare her when i was a kid
bees?
wtf?
are you a beephobe?
My kid got stung by a wasp that ranks 3 on the 0-4 Schmidt pain scale. My worst sting was only a 2.
wildcamping in SW England with a few mates
took a dog shit tent for a laugh
pop up single layer thing that cost a score or something
second night
already bedded down
3am-ish
feel something in my ear
fucking spider
it's trying to crawl in, I'm trying to get it out
impossible
try to ignore it and go to sleep
genuinely losing my mind
thought I was going to have a psychological breakdown
putting my knife in my ear
jam it about
cut my ear hole
get half the spider out
at least it stopped crawling
shit brah, that sounds like hell ngl !
When I was 12 swimming in the river I got a tick on my ballsack and didn't notice it until at least 24 hours after when taking a shower. I'm still not sure to this day at 29 if my balls were always meant to be this shriveled or if that tick just totally fucked up my balls permanently.
-let me check- hmmm... Mmm yes yees YES! you balls are juuuust fine mmm
be me
12-year-old /outist in training, always fucking off innawoods
find tick in my hair a day or so after hoodrat woods shit, show mom
mom doesn't care
symptoms start soon after
mom says I'm being paranoid
walking around the house with a rash and increasing fever for days
mom says I'm faking it
start puking my guts out, mom says I might be sick, gives me fucking bonine
nope
she finally breaks down and takes me to the er
Delerious with fever, don't know where I am or who anyone is
have to spend three days in the hospital on an IV, but I get tendies and I can watch a VHS of the Pokemon movie until everyone wants to scream
tl;dr: Almost died from RMSF because my mom was lazy
Maybe anons will think I'm chicken shit, but ticks are the only thing here that scare me. I can get bitten by a dozen wasps and walk it off with no fucks given, but one tick bite wrecks a trip. Lyme, Alpha Gal, RMSF are no joke. The medical literature on Lyme makes it clear we barely have a clue about it, the best hope is to get an antibiotic early enough to drop your risk of getting it by 90%. Shit basically leads to permanent nerve damage where recoveries seem iffy often times.
So yeah I drive 2+ hours to go out during tick season with the dog.
what a shitty mom wtf
Pretty much same here. bees, spiders, ants, flies...they're all varying degrees of annoying but I can deal with them, except for peak blackfly season when I just don't go /out/ because of how unbearable they are. But ticks...I've never even seen one of those little niggers but they're supposedly common around my local area and I'm always very paranoid about them. One bite going unnoticed and you're allergic to red meat forever...fuck that.

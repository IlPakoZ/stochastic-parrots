one bad thing about going /out/ in paths that ppl usualy don't go is them 
those fuckers can get us pretty bad
the ones that get behind get all the bites of ants and bees brah ! 
spiders very rarely bite someone
I've never had a problem with bees, but ant hills are usually easy enough to avoid if you're paying attention. I just don't like getting spider webs all over my face.
Ants
some of them are actually really tasty, tastes like lemon, and i will frequently eat them on breaks if i see the right kind of anthill, dont like the larvae though
spiders
hmm, dont really have a story, threw one at a girl when i was a kid, does that count?
i had one on my balls once 0/10 would not recommend, found the "forbidden caviar" once though, that was neat
are flies even polinators or do they just fly around eating shit all day? also, arent they what bring Cryptosporidium to some water sources? besides literal shit ofcourse
flies
are flies even polinators or do they just fly around eating shit all day? also, arent they what bring Cryptosporidium to some water sources? besides literal shit ofcourse
they cool, but i accidentally hung my hamock over a rotten stump once and the next morning i hit it with my axe and it turned out to be the lair of Doctor Bees and he was very angry, so i bravely ran away
i think leeches are oddly cool too, used to collect them in a bucket and put them on my fingertips and waggle them at my mother to scare her when i was a kid
bees?
wtf?
are you a beephobe?
My kid got stung by a wasp that ranks 3 on the 0-4 Schmidt pain scale. My worst sting was only a 2.
shit brah, that sounds like hell ngl !
When I was 12 swimming in the river I got a tick on my ballsack and didn't notice it until at least 24 hours after when taking a shower. I'm still not sure to this day at 29 if my balls were always meant to be this shriveled or if that tick just totally fucked up my balls permanently.
-let me check- hmmm... Mmm yes yees YES! you balls are juuuust fine mmm
tl;dr: Almost died from RMSF because my mom was lazy
Maybe anons will think I'm chicken shit, but ticks are the only thing here that scare me. I can get bitten by a dozen wasps and walk it off with no fucks given, but one tick bite wrecks a trip. Lyme, Alpha Gal, RMSF are no joke. The medical literature on Lyme makes it clear we barely have a clue about it, the best hope is to get an antibiotic early enough to drop your risk of getting it by 90%. Shit basically leads to permanent nerve damage where recoveries seem iffy often times.
So yeah I drive 2+ hours to go out during tick season with the dog.
what a shitty mom wtf
Pretty much same here. bees, spiders, ants, flies...they're all varying degrees of annoying but I can deal with them, except for peak blackfly season when I just don't go /out/ because of how unbearable they are. But ticks...I've never even seen one of those little niggers but they're supposedly common around my local area and I'm always very paranoid about them. One bite going unnoticed and you're allergic to red meat forever...fuck that.

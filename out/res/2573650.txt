Please tell me you guys don't drop into these things?
Hahahahahahahaha!
OH LOL LEAVE NO TRACE
Bro animal leave poop all over the place /out/ bro come on.
Only in heavily trafficked alpine or glacier routes, or heavily trafficked desert rock climbing destinations. These environments just can't process all the human waste fast enough.
i consume so much fiber and coffee that my shits havent been solid in years, more like the consistency of pudding. it basically soaks into the ground and disappears in less than an hour. with the right squatting position i leave a nice shit puddle and often dont need to wipe
Depending on the weather, how I take a shit can dramatically change. Hot summer days I'll take shit in the river, this helps cool me down, also don't need to wipe. Colder months I just use a 5 gallon bucket, pool noodle, paper bag, just burn the shit later.
I just shit on the bike paths.
This
I'm not shitting in a bag and keeping it next to my food for 12 hours if I'm in a national forest
This "Leave No Trace™" shit is just a sign of oversocialization.
I get that you shouldn't leave plastic or any unnatural shit behind. 
But if it's natural, like shit or ash from a fireplace, I leave it.
Humans are part of nature. And this Leave No Trace meme is a fucking psy-op to further divide human beings from their primitive nature.
Like I said, if you litter, you should be put to death, but shitting in a fuck bag is fucking ridiculous.
Hunter Gatherers left traces too. A lot of them. As do other animals.
I think it's more of a trail runner thing, isn't it? Imagine if all the people that travel the overused and overcrowded trail systems just shit on the ground and left burned out fires everywhere. It'd look like downtown San Francisco.
Trail runners usually don't stay /out/ long enough that they have to shit innawoods, or build campfires.
Also, I hate the "if we allow all people to do XYZ, then everybody will start doing XYZ, and it will ruin it."
That's how authoritarian regimes start.
I've never managed to shit while out. I'll go a week without doing so easily.
I just dig a hole, you can even use leaves. You can also bathe and shower with clean water, but you can take tp if you really want and bury it as well.
This
Besides, these these things leave a far bigger trace overall. Yeah your shit pile won't be sitting, beautifully placed, in the middle of a scenic a rock overhang, but it and all the bag material and that alcohol ass wipe and whatever gelling chemical is....those will be in the trash bin by the ranger station which will have to be carried by a diesel truck to the landfill 100 miles away.
And that is to say nothing of the impact of the factory that makes the kits, and the one that makes the plastic films, and the ones that make the ass chemicals, and the mines and wells needed in their supply chain, and the ships to haul it all over here from China.
Bunch of feel good retard pretend friends to the environment. It makes me want to buy a cabin in Montana.

You are beginning to understand the mindset of the redneck.
Imagine approaching an Indigenous tribe and telling them that they are immoral and evil for hunting and eating meat, and you get an idea of how absurd and ignorant their sanctimonious moralizing is.
Now when they try to force their moral arrogance and ignorance of reality on you, they call it legislation and progress.
Based ESL larper
I haven't shit solid in years and don't wipe
Seek medical help
Rednecks of all people have gotta have the LEAST qualms about hunting and eating meat, save Indians.
I think you're referring to the urbanites/bug ppl who don't understand reality, not the frontiersmen who actually settled the nation and the hicks who currently base a large portion of their cultural identity around hunting/eating meat
I'm pretty sure a coyote ate my poop.
Feelin lazy
Feelin full
find a bit of soft dirt
shit and lightly cover it.
Come back next day
Coyote tracks coming in, light digging marks, and going out
Poop's gone.
Look around, just straight pondering
Kinda makes me not worry about leaving scat in the middle of nowhere now... 
Also
How do i exploit this?
Wolves, wild dogs, coyotes and off leash dogs eat poop all the time. Canines love eating shit, especially human poo. If you don’t want them to get it you’ve gotta cover your shit with big rocks. Or just leave it for them, you’re supplementing their diet and they find it delicious apparently
Next time, i'll make sure to take an extra big poop so we can be frens
I thought trail runners were the ones who'd shit themselves instead of stopping. Or was that some other form of insane long distance running?
I can withstand 1 week without taking a dump
This. If you can dig it deep then fine, if the turd is going to be there frozen/dessicated a year from now then poop in a bag.

Hey /out/,
I've seen this Norwegian youtuber who wears Muck-style boots when he hikes. I thought it was funny since I can't imagine one's foot is very secure in these, but the last time I was in Norway I hiked around where he lives and noticed it was pretty mild terrain compared to where I'm from (Northern Idaho), so it makes sense that he could go for a stroll in these. I was thinking that there has to be a brand of these books that's on par with commercial hiking boots like Lowa or Salomon though, since all it would take is a good sole, but I don't know where to start looking. Does anything like this exist? I'd love to have a boot I can throw on and not worry about anything at all, and be able to go everywhere in.
they exist. Pretty much impossible to get in the US though. It's more of a Taiga boot, less useful outside of scandinavia or in the lower 48.. But I wear them anywhere
Not great if you are walking steep Alps in summer or for tourist hiking on concrete and agricultural roads.

My Xtratuf deck boots are comfortable for boating and general wear during heavy rain. I haven't tried their muckboots.
I tried to watch this guy's videos, but he just says the same few things every video.
rubber boots are normal here in norway, everyone has a pair. and 2-8 year olds use them almost exclusively. you can use them anywhere but may want different boots above treeline, they get heavy when you really have to lift your feet. two layers of good socks are required to prevent blisters and wick sweat. nothing keeps water out like a rubber boot but it keeps water in just as well.
ankle support is for old people, above-treeline-hunters and trad backpackers

goes up to the nearby mountains 
I like the mountains
spend a lot of time and nights in the mountains
builds a shelter 
locals in my town spot a crazy man living in the mountains 
summer comes around
I start staying in my shelter for nights more often
I go to my local night club
Talk to some people
They tell me about this crazy man who lives in the nearby mountains and I should be careful out there
They dont know that I am that crazy man
It's pretty retarded that you didn't adjust your scarf thing over the sun glass like the other side. Sane people would never do what you did and I think you owe us an apology.
I go to my local night club
Talk to some people
How in the holy fuck are you able to talk to people over 145dB “music”?
he went there to kill everyone 
nobody hears any screams in loud music
im sorry man>>2566994
the club were i was had a smoking area and i spent most of my time there cuz it wasnt as loud and i like talking to people
i was thinking about it the whole time
Take the villagecrazypill anons
be on NEETBUX
live in a secluded manor/shack but close enough to be seen be seen by other villagers
play dogs barking sound, screams and odd noises on full blast every other days
wear a cloak and wander at night crawling under people windows
spend your days roaming in the forest or sitting somewhere in the village in complete silence
be both feared and respect
You forgot the best part 
befriend the baker/butcher for free scraps so when the town gets riled up he can come in and say “I know him he’s a good man just keeps to himself”
thats what i did most of last summer
People really just blogpost anything these days.
bad bait, throw something fresh on the hook
The only bad bait here is OP's post. People should be embarrassed about the (lack of) quality of posts like this. It's horrific.
funniest thing is that they don't know I'm actually trans
make your own thread, then, instead of complaining in someone elses. you probably already tried that and no one cared, so you post here hoping to shame yourself slightly less. either way, you have no self control and it's a burden on the rest of us.
you sound like me kek
Normally I’d recommend being euthanized but you’ve Already secluded yourself from society so i can respect it
what if they aren't talking about you and there's something else secretly watching, waiting for you to drop your guard
talking to normie cattle
only thing you did wrong bro
Tbh.

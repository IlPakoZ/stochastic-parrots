There were once plants in this valley
A concrete plant is technically still a kind of plant
have you seen what the original "windows meadows background" looks like now, spare yourself child
And there was a cock inside ya mum at one point wasn't there eh?
There will be once too.
it's just an ordinary vineyard
nooo you need to preserve your own property as I remember it forever, for my enjoyment
yes
It was always a vineyard to begin with anyway, it just happened that the picture was taken in a year where everything had been torn out because of a recent crop disease and then a recent storm had made everything green.
I would nut tap you if you were in range.
This looks like a surface mine for coal.
I drove by it a few months ago--its at the base of the Santa Clara plateau. It still looks like a vineyard. It was always mostly photoshopped breh.
that appears to be a coal mine, when their done stripping the coal layer, the overburden is replaced and top soil is capped over with local seeds. Germany has it down to a science with their massive coal mines.
mine reclamation has come a LONG way in recent decades, there are a couple spots that I ve looked at recently that you almost couldnt tell anyone had ever done anything on the site. Its a really good feeling to think even with how destructive mining is you can clean it up and make the place livable in under 10 years.
Now they just need to learn how to do the same thing with the dupont surface mines down here in north Florida
Its a really good feeling to think even with how destructive mining is you can clean it up and make the place livable in under 10 years.
lol
quickly checks google images of Florida Dupont mines
Oh fuck thats horrible, how is that allowed but metals mines have to completely cleanup everything they touch.
on average it takes 10 years for the plant life to settle and thrive. Its better than leaving it abandoned or not bothering to clean up at all.
mining is the least impactfull industry of them all 
usualy mineral deposits don't allow plants to grow anyway, you only destroy steril soil not to mention that they don't pour chemicals in the soil either ... 
if you're going to compare mining with food industry, big pharma, big tech, clothes industries etc etc you'll see at least 100x more destruction that mining 
Mining even consider puting revegetation plans and helping the fauna while they're mining, other industries don't do that at all quite the oposite
Some areas up here have bounced back more or less, the forests now are indistinguishable from 20+ year old replanted timber tracts. But there's other areas where the reclamation didn't take and now it's just a massive sand pit. Not sure what causes it, but their whole method involves sucking up like the first 5 feet of topsoil and running it through centrifuges to get the titanium dioxide and other minerals. Essentially leaving only dead soil behind.
See the difference is in lots of European countries the governments care about their country, while in America the government officials care about embezzling funds into their own pockets, and making the stock market preform well, because they make all their money in the stock market.
And that's just one industry lol. Phosphate mining is a whole different ballgame. For the record in not against mining, but there's better ways to do it. There's absolutely better ways to ensure we don't have levees and dikes breaking, spilling straight poison water into our rivers and aquifer. But yeah corporate greed drives everything and everybody wants cheap things right now goddamnit!
yeah well becky and her hippie friends in the city want iphones so we have to dig up entire mountain ranges for rare metals to make touch screens
There were once people who went outdoors on /out/
almost couldn't tell
If that photo is an example of that in your mind I'm sorry, but no. You can see where it was all carved out, the giant obviously unnatural pit of water and the fact most of it is barren.
There was once cum in ya mum's cunt.
Our planet has almost torn itself apart a few times in history. Eventually life will reclaim that mined area, life always, finds a way
I have to agree, go to texas between Dallas and Houston. off 45 if you ever have a chance. that's strip mine- coal country, like you heard happened in WV, it was happening there [arguably WV was just more pretty before it] that coal is everywhere you can find hunks of it naturally occuring in the small creeks and rivers. 
That region hates Obama because his policy's closed down the coal plants and with them gone the mines. drying out most towns income. 
but it's been less than 20 years, and most of it you cannot even tell from the roads or tops of the hills it was once stripped mined. Trees grown on it, and grasses replaced/let grown back. 
I'm not saying it's a pretty place to live- large portion of people there are horrible people. The younger folks leave and never come back unless they have no other choice. Their boom was in the 80's and every house built in the region is a cheaply slapped up Mcmasnion thats rotting from the ground up, at least every 4 out of 5 homes I saw had termite damage, rot, or some electrical fire in the past. along with the corruption of local small town politics, where who ever in town has the most money, gets to do what the fuck ever they want. God help you if that person is also a righteous bible thumper.
OP is a mine in Mongolian, thats not going to happen there.
And they had to get rid of those plants to mine coal to power your computer to make this stupid post.
Mining minerals allows you to be freely /out/.
le eco-revolutionism
Fighting for survival is not the same as using modern technology (information at your finger tips) to experience the outdoors
and they have turned to coal in due course anon :3
okay now drink the water or eat anything grown from the soil

I was thinking lately about how many people, especially on the internet, are superstitious enough to fear nature enough to avoid it. I mean sure, bears, wolves, panthers and ither predators exist but I think people are generally more scared of the supposedly supernatural.
And then I thought even more, you see, most cryptids were made up to scare people into good behavior and smart thinking, like the Wendigo, invented by native tribes to discourage cannibalism or Kelpies, made up to keep Scottish children away from the water where they could drown.
And so I realized, maybe the discussion about cryptids was intentionally rekindled by some malicious organization to scare people away from nature.
Could it be the government? Some big corporation? The British royal family? I Don't know, maybe I'm just spewing bullshit.
Sorry for putting on the tinfoil hat but I've been thinking a lot about this possibility.

take your meds faggot.

I think there are scarrier things than cryptids out there. Look up disappearances in national parks. Bodies being found days later right where the people went missing, dead yet completely preserved. Read about this and consider the Irish superstition of faery related deaths, the Bermuda triangle and the USS Philadelphia.
I think that there are certain places, maybe intersecting lay lines or maybe some kind of weak point in the Aether, where you can kind of fall through time and space. Like a video game that glitches and you fall through the level and get caught in some kind of purgatory where you can't escape with your life.
The first part of your post is correct: folklore and mythology uses what we'll call contrarian figures to reinforce social norms and taboos. In addition to the ones you've mentioned, consider figures like the Navajo skinwalker: a witch born of fratricide or some other familial murder, which then goes even further to desecrate the sacred family unit by raping or killing those who leave the safety of the roundhouse. Family, community, and the sanctity of the home are integral to Navajo culture.
However, you wrongly attribute the creations of these figures to some malicious and manipulative forces. More likely, these were simply stories someone created that took on a life of their own. Today, as back then, people enjoy expansive imaginations and both love to tell stories and hear them. Stories that have meaning or play on our psyche are the most alluring, so they are the most repeated. It is, for the most part, an entirely organic phenomenon.
How can you know that they are wrongly attributed? If you studied anthropology then you will know that accepted science of any flavor is a very narrow bandwidth of information which is dubious in nature and origin, more often than not due to (((political))) reasons. There may be basic archetypical fears and desires but there are also extraordinary and phenomenal occurrences that science is completely unequipped to describe.

This is outdoor related. These experiences happen when people go /out/. It's a global phenomena and h
It's worth discussing.
I also shit when I go out, but you don't see me making entire threads dedicated to it. Keep your schizo garbage on /x where it belongs
And yet that is a legitimate topic worthy of discussion on /out/
Newfag get out
It would be extremely unlikely that some shadow government is creating creepypastas and cryptids in an effort to prevent people from going outside. I won't say that a governing power has never fabricated stories to encourage conformity (it absolutely has happened) but stories discouraging you from traversing certain areas have existed since prehistory. For example, if we look at Proto-Indo-European linguistics and Eurasian poetry and mythology, it would seem that stories of serpents living in dangerous places like rivers and swamps predate written language.
Add to all this that most people don't even believe in most cryptids, and it would be a decent amount of work to pull if the conspiracy with very little gain. If some powerful organization was going to discourage people from going outside, it's much more likely that they would manufacture some kind of debilitating disease, probably one spread by some small parasite or pest that inhabits wooded and wild areas but is relatively uncommon in manicured city parks.
Looks like shit and cryptids are on the menu at /out/. Did you ever take a shit in the woods and feel like you were being watched?
I'm not suggesting that a government is responsible, just that some things are phenomenal in a way that science is not equipped to describe.
ROFL at the thought of Jeff The Killer being a government psyop
Almost wish it were true, would be funny as fuck
You sound like an insufferable white woman
Don’t forget the USS Liberty. The real boogeyman is out there
I specifically go /out/ to smoke weed with the cryptids.
Do you mind linking them?

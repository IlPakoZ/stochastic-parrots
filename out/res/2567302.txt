Fuck getting skilled at bushcrafting, hunting, or backpacking and making a successful YouTube channel, just buy a Walmart tent and get stoned in it
he's doing what you daydream of doing but cheap and easy and without it even being his interest. plus you're an anally retentive autist and it makes you mad.
get a life loser
Yikes
I think OP's point is that stoners watch low effort content because they're retarded, or is your post seething about people making fun of retarded drug addicts?
I never indicated I was mad, I just never realized how low the bar is for YouTube views these days
i don't do drugs
algorithm picks up things that don't deserve it all the time, it has nothing to do with quality of content. most youtubers now only talk about thumbnail, length, and title in terms of advertisement, because that's the only thing the algorithm looks for when deciding whether or not to push a video.
The amount of pot heads that live in the forest surrounding cities is massive. The off grid fandom actively seethe about these druggies because they dont chug tens of thousands into retarded homesteads and just illegally poach and live off the land. When they get caught they get a slap on the wrist like the nigs they are because it’d be too expensive to keep them locked up
The tent may be cheap, but dude's still dropping a pretty penny on his gear.
Dude’s most likely on welfare like most potheads are, or dissability (have you ever met a pothead that didn’t begin listing all the shit wrong with them like they were perks in a game?).
hell yeah dude
The glass costs four times as much as the tent, was my point.
don't try bringing up that the drugs may be a possible cause for all their issues, last dude i told that to went ballistic
I've never met a pothead who was responsible with money or who had his priorities in order. For them, it's weed > everything else.
He was going to have that glass regardless if he was camping or not and should obviously not be listed as a cost of entrance to potheads living on the edge of society
That's a tautology. If you didn't judge a person to have "weed > everything else" priorities, you wouldn't describe that person as a pothead. You aren't talking about users of marijuana, you're talking about people who make marijuana use the core of their identity.
I would give seven to two odds that he wouldn't bring that bong if he wasn't recording for YouTube. Joints, blunts, and bowls, sure, but that glass is a prop.
*seven to two against
False
hahahah you're all mad. I take a bunch of weed with me into the bush and go further and camp in cooler places than 90% of /out/. 
Cry more you autistic fucks.
why do drug addicts think everyone's mad? we feel sorry for you bro. i hope one day you're happy enough to live life sober
i take more drugs and go deeper
Just be a cute girl and its even easier.
Woman-does-X always has astronomically more potential for views than any random competent bloke doing the same thing. Especially if theres a neuron activating thumbnail.
Tbhfam all the milemaxing and beakbagging came when I was much older. What got me interested in camping was smoking dope and being free. I don't hate these dorks. They are idiots and I would recommend they show some restraint. But who among us couldn't have shown some restraint when we were 25.
you misspelled 'daddy's money'
This man just typed the same thing twice and thought we wouldn't notice
ngmi anon, you need more real world experience. Captcha nGAY(u)d
So do I man, well no I don't feel sorry for myself I deserve what I get for my choices but I do hope to enjoy being sober and get more from life in the wilderness. That's the only time I really smoke anyway. Thanks for your hopes.
He's not an outdoors channel you fucking retard. How are you niggers dumber than stoners?
Reddit is down the hall, faggot
this poster is not addicted to cannabis
and can quit anytime he wants.
It's not just how "low" the bar is. Your content has to "fit in". You need to be on good terms with the (((algorithm))).
Every addict in denial does that. Why am I so depressed when all I do is watch rick and Morty, porn, and smoke weed all day?
Look at this loser and his 100 lb setup. He couldnt walk a mile with all that junk. He obviously doesn't browse r/Ultralight. Smh
No shit . Why are you fags so mad and quick to point out projected flaws in my post?
Amen. I love car camping, bushcraft channels are fun to watch but it's way more fun to just park under a tree and set up a tent a few yards away. Plus you get all those wonderful cooking smells from your neighbors and you can take a stroll among the all-white people and admire all the little glowy lamps hanging from their RVs.
The ascendant outdoor philosophy.
if he's in the USA the dea or local police depending might like his video evidence
DEA going after absolute whos in the woods 
Every place with an actual DEA office has a crack house with mcdonalds distance that has and will continue to exist unless one of the meth heads calls in a murder. 
You mean the sheriff? Too busy running ticket scams on the interstate
youtube you mean the site where anyone can upload any video? you claim the bar is too low for posting content "these days"?
Really makes you think... weed stopped being cool when they made it legal everybody knows that.
Based reasonable Xer
yeah x is alot of fun. 2nd most fun drug after lsd.
i bet you have an ultralight micro penis. 
That must give you a leg up.
not me. i got kicked off YT for trying to talk sense into genital mutilating, bug eating normies.
just become tans and be finally accepted
no ur just a simpleton i get what he means.
I enjoy drinking a bit while out, does that make me an alcoholic?
If I enjoy smoking while out, does that make me some cancer-ridden freak with a hole in his neck?
If I've had sex while out, does that make me a terminally obsessed sex addict?
NTA but it looks like a bunch of newfags were never taught the word "moderation".
Absolutely retarded take, having a campfire too close to water at the wrong time of the year or in protected land is far more enforced than weed
I agree, most all weed smokers have a problem with moderation
Generally when a video has lots of views its either truly exceptional content, or comes from someone doing videos for many years.
You can probably guess what category RawOG420 falls into. He's been uploading videos regularly for 7 years. What looks like lazy, cash-grab content is actually a years-long labor of love, speaking to his passion and dedication. It takes a lot of work to keep a project going for so long, and several hundred thousand loyal subscribers were his reward.
Lol its affect you retarded redditor
Or they're just like everyone else and watch videos of things they want to do to fill a void in their life. Relax.
What's the point of making a garbage post if you can't handle people calling out that it's garbage?
You don't have to be around people to car camp. I find spots I can wrangle my yaris into without getting stuck, faaaar away from anyone when I go on my trips. A cliff on range land on a cliff just outside zion? The perfect place to eat your 100mg marijuana infused pizza you picked up in Arizona. Live a little.
The people that I've heard this from in blue collar life have almost always been alcoholics. If not, they were into some cult shit where the church ruled their lives.
a joke has to be funny anon.
You have to have a sense of humor anon.
If a tent leaks it's not worth buying and most of the tents at Wal-Mart will leak.
It could possibly cost 100 times as much or a fraction of the cost of that tent. When I was a pothead, I ordered chinese knock off bongs from DHgate. I did know other fellow retarfs who paid over $1000 for dab rigs and bongs.
or you can just grow up and realize you have the maturity level of a toddler but i guess thats asking too much.
nta but infantilizing people you disagree with is a bad look
I know a decent amount of pot heads, all of them have well paying jobs with only a few being wagies. None of them list shit that is wrong with them.
What is it with Americans making /out/ such a MUH SURVIVAL TACTICOOL MARINE NAVY SEAL TIER 1 OPERATOR SHTF APOCALYPSE PREPPER LARPfest?
Most other people just go /out/ to have a fun relaxing time, enjoying life, meditating and all that.
But you mutts always act like you´re some Tier 1 operator, who is prepping for "le ebic SHTF".
It shows in the style of your youtube videos.
Go watch any /out/ YT video from a mutt, and its gonna be some fat retard who never made it through basic training, going on and on about survival, wearing a buzzcut, tacticool gear, and acting like there´s a soviet spetznaz team on his fucking trail.
Then watch your average canadian or European /out/ youtuber, and it´s all about having a good time, totally relaxed and all that.
Why are you like that?
"No shit"
Is not compatible with:
you assumed he is making content in the outdoors niche you moronic cunt. Stop shitting up the board with your joyless elitist faggotry.
Because they don't relate to those people and it makes them mad that not only do they enjoy the same thing, but they enjoy it and relate to each other
It's because they know they can do it without having to get a special loicense from the nanny state
this excuse is for children. 25 is way past the time you should've started living right. but 
it is what it is
Marijuana addicts are so retarded and pathetic. This is why some people die when they go camping. This yahoo will one day overdose on Marijuana in the woods and get himself killed in a fit of delusion and paranoia thinking a wedigo is coming after him or something.

I want to explore Mexico and do some backpacking, starting with the area around Juarez in Baja California. Has anyone done /out/ in Mexico? Any Mexico anons here?
My suggestion is Chiapas
Ur gonna end up in a narco rekt thread
If you speak Spanish: go to Patagonia or southern Chile. Mexico is the mexico of mexico, worse, it's full of mexicans.
I don't have the funds for that kind of fun. Baja is only 3 hours away and as a kid I went camping all over Baja with my family. Nothing but good times and very safe back then, but now it's listed as level 3 by the state department, which means "reconsider travel" because of the risk of being murdered. But how great is the risk? I can be murdered right here in my small town by a redneck or a mexican gangbanger from Las Vegas (niggers don't come to this town). I don't want to drive or hike into a death zone in Mexico, so I need to know how to avoid them. Talk to the locals?
YES! LISTEN TO FOX NEWS! BE SCARED! BUY GUNS ( THAT YOU WILL NEVER USE) ! DO IT! DO IT NOW!
... God the Trump/Biden years have really brainwashed you huh? sad to see
doesn't the government say not to go to Mexico right now because of the government/cartel war. your a total fucking retard, he would be lucky to have a gun in that situation. 
you would be the sort of person to end up like other tourists who run away scared when something terrible happens who you've fucked up backpacking through cartel territory

enjoy getting killed by narcos
If you aren't a boomer in age you're certainly one in mentality.
I have family that lives in MÃ©xico
Man some of you guys are really soft and it shows
I just spent 2 weeks in Oaxaca and it was awesome. You people are retards
It's funny, there's really nothing going on in almost every state in the country, you Americans think Mexico is just two cities, the truth is it's a pretty big country, it's more likely that if you go into the wilds of the country you'll get kidnapped by a tribe of communists or eaten by a coyote, If you want to go exploring be careful and know where you will be because if you disappear no one will bother to look for you.
It's like if someone said don't go into the woods in the United States because a nigger will kill you!
yeah so do I nigger
Including family that's been murdered
Says the guy who hasn't been to Mexico in his life lol
It's liberal dream world, all brown countries are safe and amazing
You should get out of your country more, there are plenty of places like this.>>2575211
Ew why is the beach brown?

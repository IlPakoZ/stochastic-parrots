I got lost in moutains (Verdon, France) with only few Ã©quipement and not much for freezing temperature.
I found a shelter at 2500m altitude and even in my tent and sleepingbag i was still going hypothermia. 
I managed to find candle and burned the wax while doing exercise to warm myself but it was tough i was still freezing, than at 6 o clock temperature got up and i escaped. I was surround by snow, my steps burying me to my chest in the snow, i had to find strategy like climbing in trees to progress.
Ive seen what its like to know that you will die if your plan fail. Finding this shelter even if it was cold af inside was pure luck, otherwise i dont think that i would have passed the night.
This never happend.
It happend and it changed my mind on what im doing with my life, life is precious you cant waste it and underachive. I will try my best to get a good life, a good family and friends.
You were unprepared but lucky
Just don't be dumb next time
consider a class in mountain survival
rofl yuros
why did you go out in freezing temperatures with gear that apparently wasnt meant for freezing temperatures?
I did not plan for losing my way, but no harm came so it was not tragique.
Yet here you are.
Kek got em
What will you change in your life going forward from here friend?
FAKE AND GAY
stay safe homie
I cant prove you that its not fake and i dont even care if you believe me, i just wanted to express that facing death changed my mind.
And dont go camping in a moutain alone underequiped
I'm glad you made it back safely m8. don't let this derail you forever.
I will get back to it once i get better equipement and knowlege, looking at the pictures that i took gives me shivering. Winter and the cold is really the puremanifestation of death
Lmao how shitty is that sleeping bag? You probably were hiking in a t shirt too weren't you?
Verdon is big you know and i was at 2250m altitude
This is the weather forcast at 3000m. I suggest you take a warm sweater next time, dummy.
This board...
I once weighted my shrooms incorrectly and took between 8 and 10 grams by accident. I died that day.
What was it like?
Well, I'll drop time spent here daily from six to four hours. Then I'll start earning money, there's a bunch to be made on cryptos
but that's still pretty low dose anon. some people are doing 40-50 grams no problem.
i once thought i was eating one 4-ho-met but instead i ate four-4-ho-mets
Nice
LMAO

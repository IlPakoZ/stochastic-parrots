First for best telescopic rod is the one you exchanged for a 3pc.
Talk about fishin
I know nothing about flies, but want to try some on an UL spinning rod. Is it much of a challenge casting with some split shot and an indicator? What sort of flies nyphms streamers should I try first? Am I better off just getting a beginner fly rod and practicing. Mainly want to target trout in a river, but might try for bass and bluegill in the ponds
Why do I feel uneasy about 2 piece rod. As soon as I started using a lightweight 1pc rod, my beginner 2pc feels like it could break at anytime.
I like these ones
Use the smallest bobber you can get away with, consider looking in to casting bubbles, and any nymph size 10-16 should work for bluegill. Grasshopper dry flies are the goat in summer, especially with dry/dropper rig. Wooly buggers and other streamers for bass, then trout will go after Adam's, elk hair caddis, pheasant tail nymphs, frenchies, zebra midges, streamers like wooly buggers, and terrestrial like ants and crickets. 
Yes, if you want to do trout bluegill and bass with one combo get a 6 weight. 
You might just be autistic.
And these for ultralight fishing
I’ve been looking at some sub $100 5/6wt kits on Amazon that have had my eye for a bit, just never pulled the trigger. There’s a guy who fly fishes at my local pond and his advice to me was get high quality line. Thank you for the information
Your 1 piece probably is just overall higher quality materials and built than your beginner 2 piece. Daiwa and Megabass make high end 4 piece travel rods that you couldn’t tell the difference versus 1 piece
these in the smallest size i can get away with
For under a hundred I usually recommend the eagle claw kit
this is my recommendation as well for starting out, you'll notice way more benefit from a quality line than you will from a fly rod
you don't really want to use an actual fly fishing indicator as they usually will be too light. Instead just use a small weighted bobber and let the fly sink weightless. The actual style of bobber is up to you, just need the weight.
I've only ever fished with cheap lines and haven't had any big issues with them aside from the float tips getting dirty and sinking after not too long. Casting-wise is more technique than line quality imo.
Caught 3 today.
This 4 pound hunchback bass being the biggest.
How do I stop pike from biting my fingers when I try getting my lures out of their throats, I’ve lost about 6 lures because I had to cut the line because they bit my fingers pretty good.
Have you tried pliers or forceps?
still no any open water in my area and they wont start selling permits until after 2 months
even if i could somehow manage to get myself to some open stream during next month i would be fined from here to hell and my gear would be confiscated, european spring is the best time ever to be a fisherman
gillplate grip and long pliers. I still get nipped very now and then but thats part of the game
Those could hurt the fish
Going fishing hurts the fish.
More than a hook or two left behind in its mouth?
I do it all the time using 5ft ul rod, 8lb braid, oros idicator, 3ft of 6x tippet and whatever nymph is working at the time. Will also trail the nymph with 8-12” of same the tippet and a size 18 or 20 scud. I Fish smaller wild trout streams and it works just fine. Will also run the same set-up on a 6’6” spinning rod in bigger water. Was forced to try this due to an elbow injury which wouldn’t allow me to swing a fly rod. Can “pitch” the flies pretty easy with this rig.
are megabass rods are fragile as they seem
Yeah, they're fragile. And besides their Arms Super Leggera (the fancy, $1,000 rod), their entire line-up of rods are all manufactured in China. Biggest reason I don't touch them. For how much they charge, they better be made in Japan, but they aren't. 
Nice rods, but I think Shimano/Loomis and St. Croix are better.
I don't care if you're deadsticking or doodling, finnesse fishing with a splitshot rig sure is a handy way to hit your limit
2nd day of committing to swimbaits: 17 inch laker on 4 inch glide. Any tips for locating smallmouth opposed to other fish? This lake is know to have big smallmouth and lakers. I've been catching lakers pretty consistently fishing off of points near dropoffs where the bottom is cobble. I have caught decent smallmouth in the past around rock bottom but I don't want to throw my swimbaits there because they would get snagged for sure.
Stop fishing for pike if you're that retarded.
Like you could do that in pike infested waters. These fuckers literally bite everything.
Got a good flathead, bros.
Be honest how bad did I just goofed?
figures
i just crossed over into the 250+ range for rods and was considering a levante for a worm rod, might go with a victory instead just for the warranty, not that i'm really hard on my gear or anything
I don't have any desire to learn how to fly fish but damn I love watching fly tying videos, it's cool as hell to watch a fly come together
i'm total shit at fly fishing but wading in creek and catching some sunfish and dinks is an absolute blast
Lol wtf
You'll have to get some high-test line if you plan on reeling in a deer, but otherwise not bad
Yeah but I don't even know how to Bow fish I want to learn cause I think it would be fun to shoot mullet with a arrow.

How are jap fishing companies so much better at advertising than American ones? This is ridiculous https://www.proxinc.co.jp/sekaikarano/index.html
This one too https://www.proxinc.co.jp/sekaikarano2/index.html
Sounds to me like you already know where they are. That's precisely how I locate my smallies.
Throw an open water glidebait over those same spots, a XSS or SS and just fish the top water column. It'll call those fish from the bottom to come look. If you spot them coming up very aggressive, you're 100% getting bit. Once they're following and trying hard to bite it, work it aggressively chopping it. 
If you're fishing next to walls or cliffs, throw it parallel to the cliff/wall and keep your glide hugging the wall, almost banging it on the wall when you glide it. If there's a shade line near said wall, throw it parallel with the shade line and work it in and out of that shade line. 
Throwing a snagless softbait over that cobble can work too, like a 6" magdraft freestyle, citizen 6" (hard to get), huddleston 68, etc.
What is your opinion on spaded hooks? The hook stays always in the right position when the line is wrapped around the shank. You can do this with ringed hooks too with knotless knot but its nearly impossible to tie micro hooks without knot tying tool and that does not work with ring hooks.
What skid said. I'd use a very small float for both the weight and as an indicator
Besides specific transporting constraints there are only downsides to using a multi-piece rod. Just the addition of an area which is more likely to break. Plus the decreased sensitivity makes it less desirable for any bottom contact baits
Out of curiosity what plastic are you using with that split shot rig?
Very nice 
You're bowfishing so you have goofed yourself into irredeemable shame
Because the Japanese are not advertising to bubba. They're advertising to people who care about the gear they use rather than the lowest common denominator
Get lippers and a pair of pliers, it isn't complicated. I catch needless, barracuda and a bunch of other toothy fish all the time, don't be a degenerate and just get the tools to fish responsibly.
went some boating today
Ouch, I've had them snap hooks before.
Suck it up, or alternatively stop hooking the pike that deep. It should only ever happen with deadbait. Ive been angling for pike for 20 years and ive never lost a lure because it was too deep, as in literally never
I dont really see the point of them, but i generally dont do that kind of fishing so that might be why. I occasionally run into them pretied for herring for which i guess they are fine
The tanagos I buy are like that but luckily they come pre-snelled
where 2 cop one?
Here's a few articles on the Michigan program:
https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-aims-revive-arctic-grayling-first-where-put-them
https://www.outdoorlife.com/fishing/arctic-grayling-return-to-michigan/
https://www.fieldandstream.com/conservation/grayling-reintroduction-michigan-controversy/
But those will hurt the fish!
Where can I buy some arrows that have like the screw on arrow heads I was thinking maybe maybe buying 4 arrows and the tips just to break in and hope no arrow through the hand happens my old buddy showed me videos of like arrows exploding into the hand between the middle part where the thumb and index finger are.
Anybody else weigh their lures ? Lots of bullshit weights. Like 1/2 ounce plugs only weight 4/10 of an ounce.
How accurate is your scale and how chinese are your lures?
Just sense their weight in your hand and adjust according to how much they sink.
Honestly, in hand, I can't really tell the difference between 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2. I can feel the cast difference of all of them on the same rod though.
What in the fucking hell are you trying to say. Speak English.
my scale is accurate. lots of lure manufacturer are lazy as shit. even something basic like softplastics length, if you take a tape measure to them no measurement even lines up with their model name.
it's really hard to guestimate weights if two objects are different densities. e.g. a floating minnow plug vs a lead head jig.
Use one of those
That seems kind of... unseemly.
Going boat fishing in lake roosevelt az in a couple weeks, only gear I have is a daiwa bg5000 with some 40lb dark green braid already wound. What rod and tackle should I get?
Average: Croix Triumph or fenwick hmg w/ daiwa fuego, shimano sahara fj, shimano nasci
Good enough tier: Daiwa Rebellion, Shimano Zodias, st croix premier with shimano miravel.shimano ultegra
Budget: Fenwick hmx/nighthawk/eagle with shimano sedona, daiwa legalis
I go with 3000 size reels over 2500 every time. There's other options but you can't go wrong with anything stated above, all are more than enough
Hell yeah brother thread theme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb9q1ScC4cg [Embed]
Damn brother that's a monster good eatin
Couple of each:
Spinner Baits, crank baits, senkos (light/dark), swim jigs w/ trailers, swim baits, a topwater (light or dark), couple jerkbaits, mepps/panther martin/blue fox
That should cover mostly everything, It would help if you told us what species you are targeting or what the lake has
I can now mount fishing rods to my honga headliner. While sleeping in the back.
If you want to use the reel you already have, get a 7’9”-8’ medium heavy or heavy rod that can handle up to 4oz. Tie a 20lb leader to your braid. Get some s waver 168s in some shad and baitfish patterns and Magdraft freestyles too. Fuck it and go swimbait fishing, right now is a great time to catch some big hungry bass
help me with my idea
would that work?
I do that but tied directly to the lure without the snap and yeah it usually works. Sometimes it breaks at the double uni if I tried it poorly or in the middle of the lease if the leader has a nick in it but usually it breaks at the clench.
Learn to tie an fg knot or other stronger braid to leader knot and that will happen most of the time anyway.
i use a 0,36mm leader and a 0,10mm braid
it's a pain in the ass to tie a fg with thin lines
thank you
i will try it then
I tie them on my ul saltwater setup with line that size. Can be a little tricky in the wind, but usually I tie them at home inside and they'll last through the whole session unless I have a major issue when fishing.
This is bad What percentage of easy to unhook fish for example large mouth Bass steal your lure
I get that pike are scary But you should be able to just unhook it
OK you have to stop fishing your killing too many fish and you're too afraid of the fish to actually unhook it
first fish on the new rod
post dinks
Bro is not sober Come back tomorrow and ask your question when you can articulate
That's a no fly list beard
Are these good for zander?
Its river fishing, not lakes.
anyone fish in germany?
i know that there's places where you can fish without the gay permit thing
or are you straight edge and have a permit and cook on official camping grounds
never used those shapes, I always use these types on the river
People keep telling me that panfish are idiot-proof. I've spent the last three days proving them wrong. Not a single sunny hit any of my lures. I could probably get some if I switched to worms, but I'm really not a fan of that style of fishing. I did manage to get some dink smallmouth so it's not like I'm completely skunked, but it bugs me that I haven't been able to catch a single sunfish yet.
Artificials make them more difficult because smaller sunfish have a harder time eating lures and even if fish size isn't the issue sometimes they'll still miss the hook. Flies are the best artificial for sunfish.
dude just use worms you'll slay sunfish perch and rockbass all day lol
wuts up /out/ards, where are the good fishing live streams at? im hungover as fuck and want to watch some comfy outdoors fishing streams like the old bill dance fishing shows, but twitch is all niggers in stinky rivers.
Anyone know anything about this one? I've looked around online but no dice.
They're idiot proof, once you figure out what they hit on.
if you just want some sunnies, live bait, light line and small hooks.
I've been looking into tenkara recently and it's hilarious to me that the two biggest sources of info in the west have almost completely opposite viewpoints on it.
You watch enough of the Japanese fishing channels, and you'll fall into the "It's fun and I don't give a fuck about special flies" camp. 
You'll see them using live bait, spinners, all kinds of shit on the rod.
Dawg I'm sorry man I have Autism so sometimes I have a hard time speaking grammar.
I'm just looking for some help brother.
2" white grub
1/16th jig head
if you do not catch a panfish, there are none there

I've recently upgraded from pier fishing to surf fishing. After my first foray I have come to a couple questions 
No matter how many video tutorials I watch, I just can't seem to read the surf. Either it's my local beach but the waves all seem to flow the same. I'm not able to easily see the rips or breaks. Is there a certain way I need to rethink how I see the surf?
Second was that lugging a tackle box for miles made me realize that I need to pack more efficiently. Are there any good tackle backpacks that can hold two rods and not cost me premium for what amounts to cheap Chinese material that rips on you after a few uses?
https://youtu.be/3ydE4267zp8?t=531 [Embed]
I modded a shitty chinese tacticool backpack to hold a second rod like this.
I don't know what I can tell you about the surf that can't be explained in the videos. Use polarized sunglasses if you don't already. Look for the gaps in where and when the waves are breaking.
The feature form differently depending on the conditions of the beach, slope, current, consistency of the sand. Not all beaches form the features you mentioned
That's one thing those tutorials didn't mention. If I can't spot those currents or breaks on my beach, is there any other way other than just fab-casting at random spots until I get a bite?
You just have to be better. All beach have some degree of structure. Even a basic trough will hold fish
My tip is to go out on a low tide/ low swell day with a polarized sun glasses. Even if the tide is too low, resulting water too shallow to fish, you can recognize structure better and might be able to come back there on higher tide
However, even I had regular productive days even on low tide. Sometimes fishes don't mind staying in the shallow
Good ole beans with their backs out of the water
Season-opening fish. Finally warm enough to fish comfy in my area.
Went fishing today couldn't catch anything so I did my usual on the water pastime of collecting fishing lures from trees. had to pass by a couple that were too high. But my question for you guys. Is there any type of extending metal Pole with a magnet on the end that I could pull fishing lures down with? Pic is the biggest Find today
have to tie a hegene
it's a pain in the ass to tie a loop knot with 0,20 fc
fucking renken
Get a paint roller extension pole and attach a magnet to it. No magnet on mine but I use that shit to take down Christmas lights so I don't have to go up and down ladders.
You can use the poles used for cleaning windows, or pools . You can clip a lightbulb changer on the end and get all kinds of tackle.
Been on a streak of getting a new lure just to lose it the first time I fish it. Somebody hold me
How are you losing them
Raise your line test
I think I bought the wrong size arrows for mullet.
I get 1/16oz rooster tails on my ultralight and catch sunfish all day for catfish bait at night. Small little grubs work too.
Might shoot them in half
I think you might be right felloanon
Opinions on cheap chink flylines?(30 to 40$ range) I am very new to fly fishing and kind of on a budget.
Anyone know what this is all over this yellow perch? Newer fisherman and have not encountered it before. Assuming some type of parasite?
Stupid technology
Yes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_spot_disease_(fish)
I hadn't even looked at the whole black spot situation. Do you think those white round things all in its face and gills are related?
For that price get a scientific anglers aircel fly line
Does it have a shooting head?
I like them a lot. I just got their Rio outbound shooting line knockoff and it was less than $20. I would recommend their lines to anybody. They're surprisingly very well made. I prefer them over my budget Rio lines. They cast and feel much better. You can't go wrong. Especially if you want to practice outside of the water so you don't tear up an expensive line.
they are different species of parasitic flukes. just means the water has a good population of snails and fish eating birds.
convince me to go braid over copoly
i legit can't tell a difference with sensitivity and it casts like total shit
are you making the mistake of using same # or greater braid as the copolymer ? Line casts better then thinner it is, simple as that. Braid is typically underrated significantly in line strength as well, the breaking strength is not what it will break at but rather guaranteed minimum strength.
usually 6# copoly and anywhere from 15 to 40 braid depending on what i'm doing
6# braid will cast better or about the same as 2# mono and will be stronger than 6# copoly. I use 15# braid for fishing for striped bass and bluefish in saltwater, would be overkill for most types of freshwater fishing I do.
I haven't used a line lower than 8lb test despite never catching anything over 2lbs
reminder flourocarbon is king of line choice
I want to upgrade from hand-me-down ugly stiks. I will be fishing streams, ponds, and small rivers in northern New England and the species could be trout, walleye, pike, bass. Is there anything that I'm seriously fucking up here?
besides not adding the picture like a retard
would probably need more than 110 yards
i suggest something else like yozuri hybrid, rest looks great
You can find the reel on Amazon/Ebay for $10-20 instead of on TWH. And yes you need more line, that's only about half of the capacity.
You need to fill out a reed's spool for it to cast properly. Look at the capacity on your reed's rating and match that. 
Personally, I would go for 15-20 lb braid to cover all options but 10 lb mono is fine as well for beginner
This is what I was talking about. The more exposed beaches see more errosion due to tides and are constantly changes forming the feature mentioned. Other beaches are protected from the elements and on those beaches you will find more fish on the ends where the structure is that protects the beach(rocks), rather than along the beach shore. Someone else can probably give better explanations.
Recommendations for grass carp dry flies? Had one that hit the top fly of my dry dropper rig (green foam grasshopper) and just as I was about to land it after a good fight on my 6wt it unhooked itself. After that, I was stalking 8+ of them and casting in front of their direction of movement but couldn't get hit. Really sad when they rose to the surface, bumped it with their nose without even opening their mouths, then swam away. Happened many times over 3+ hours, maybe their buddy told them to stay away from that spooky grasshopper. They seemed to be rising to grab either tiny tiny insects I couldn't see or leaves falling around them. Pic related is one I got on the bottom of my dry dropper (prince nymph) a little over a week ago, it was my first carp catch and now I want more.
Try other terrestrials, cottonwood seed flies. If you know any mulberry trees that overhang the water a mulberry fly works, and I've heard of people using attractor patterns for them like royal Wulff's 
You could also try moss flies or weightless nymphs if a near surface eat is satisfactory
rating schemas are not uniform, unlike local gravitational force.
How do you tie the foam on top of those dry flies? Is there a little tag of foam to the front and back or something?
Caught this Cabezon on a 3.8" swimbait I made, and then...
Very next cast with the same lure caught this Black &amp; Yellow Rockfish, also missed a few bites on the same lure. The water was dark but but good visibility, and the day was overcast. I made some other lures with a lot of flake (glitter) I wanted to try out but the sun never came out
I am moving from Wisconsin to Okeechobee FL next month. Is it worth keeping my Musky gear? or should I sell/give it away?
I'm sure you can just use your musky gear for salt water
another day of fishing
another day when i catched nothing
another day when my cousin catched all the fish
same lures
same technique
is that... a WOMAN... with BOOBIES???? AWOOOOOOOOOGA AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOGA *eyes pop out of head, steam shoots out of ears, heart beats out of my chest, howls like a wolf*
Anons, does your wife or gf fish with you?
My wife has recently shown an interest in fishing and has gone on like a dozen trips with me and not a single one has been pleasant.
I figured she would quit because of how much she doesn't seem to enjoy it but she keeps suggesting to plan fishing days and coming with me whenever I head out.
Tell her you will "go fishing with her" then hack her apart with an axe and use her as catfish bait.
I think she just wants to spend time with you
thanks I will get more line and I think I will try braid for the first time. When you say that I need to fill out the whole spool for proper casting, say my line has broken a few times and I've lost some length. Do I need to respool the whole thing, top it off, or is this something you just do as yearly maintenance to prevent overall degradation?
don't go with braid as a first timer
you'll have to break off a shitload before you ever notice a loss in performance and even then it would only be casting distance at worst
Wants to go fishing
She never wanted to do fishing, she wanted to do something fun, new, and with you. The peaceful lest stress aspect, and a skill she can open her brain to learning something new, away from the hell of modern society and city life, no traffic or people. 
Go out hiking or have a bon fire, eventually she possibly will want to try camping. Make it fun, teach her the trees, birds, animals, history, then be really really impressed when you later ask her an she remembers!
Big ass nigga
It's a single strip of foam looped under the shank and tied in as a parachute post, then I'll trim it to shape once the fly is done. 
Should have tried em anyways sometimes glitter is what they want in overcast conditions
Get that bitch a spinner
bitches love spinners
I did start the day off with a really bright one and landed thus black rockfish third cast. This is when the overcast wasn't too bad and I had hopes of the sun coming. I switched to a darker swimbait and caught the other 2 because not just the overcast but the water clarity started going to clear but dark to a foggy or milky. I thought in conditions like that it would be better to throw a dark bait because a light one might just blend in with the foggy water, and a dark bait would create more a silhouette and that would get the fishes attention. I'll see if I can find a picture of the water I was fishing and I would appreciate any color combination recommendations
This is what the water clarity turned into, this is northern CA , used a weedless Texas rig. What colors would you guys throw, I think I can make most colors, and have access to a bunch of different glitter, and can make soft plastic paddle tail type baits in 3.5", 3.8", 4.0", and 5.0"
This could end up bad.
i hate fly fishing
the tripfag >>2573455
is right, use flies. I've had retardedly good luck with shiny/bright ones, they'll ignore bowns, but green and black had me getting bites the second it touched down in the water.
git gud faqqit
i love fly fishing
Finally used my baitcaster setup after 2 years. I think I still prefer the simplicity and castability of my ole spinning setup. Caught a spotty on my second cast then nothing for hours after. Saw some shit jumping out of the water but no taking or I suck ass.
I personally really like the baitcaster after I get into kayak fishing and start fishing deeper water. The baitcaster ergonomic make it easier to fish from a kayak and also working the lures in deeper later. Casting distance doesn't matter that much from a kayak.
aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
That's valid. I'm mostly shorepounding long flats. My distance problems could have also been from using the lighter end of the MH rating. I'll have to play around with it some more.
?????
How good are those cheapy telescoping rods off amazon?
Me and the gf want to get into fishing, ideally something we can pack down for when on camping trips, but don't want to waste money on cheap/beginner kit if it's useless.
I am retarded
Telescoping rods are generally shit until you get into really expensive ones or niche products like tenkara poles, but you can still catch fish on shitty rods. Personally I'd recommend you get a cheapo 2-piece spinning combo instead if you're just starting out.
Do the 2 piece rods pack down very small? Sorry I know absolutely nothing about this sort of thing
rod length/2 genius
How'd you manage that, anon?
ive had one since 2014. The tip broke, but i did that by overextending and trying to force it back in all wrong. Do NOT fling it out like a sword.
Otherwise, it's caught me many a seacritter, and is unchanged aside from a new reel i wanted to put on. Small enough to fit in even my small backpack.
this will pack down
https://www.walmart.com/ip/Daiwa-Carbon-Case-Travel-Spinning-Rod-and-Reel-Combo-Kit-CC20F565L/449542406?from=searchResults
lmao literally did this today and ruined my telescoping rod
Means business.
Snagged my fly in a bush and yanked hard at a funny angle. On the bright side neither of the knots I tied failed, so I know my knot tying skills are at least passable.
Best website to buy materials for making my own in-line spinners?
Did that once but the fly came out of the bush but my tip got flung down onto a rock. It was repairable with a lighter, super glue, and electrical heat shrink tubing though since it was just the tip.
the only fishing line you can buy that is actually accurate is the stuff for line class records because its guaranteed to break at the rating. Let's say you pick up a random spool of 15# line from the store, it doesn't mean its actually breaking at 15#, it can be 18#, 22#, 25#, etc. its just marketing by the companies. Same thing with line thickness ratings, braided line is not a perfect circle or even oval, the line thickness some advertise is complete bs, and not an actually representative number.
Anyone follow the Bass Masters? A youtube just won a Bass Master Open and is now in the Classic lmfao. It's only his 2nd open (1st one he finished in 5th). He had almost 80 pounds in 3 days of 4 fish limits, fucking insane. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCeXCSjTuGI [Embed]
youtuber*
Bass fishermen are the lowliest of the low, even below the live bait fisherman.
What aspect of bass fishing is detestable?
You can catch bass on fly gear, bait finesse, live bait, tenkara poles etc.
"pro" bass fisherman. (they aren't really pro, most spend more money then they make) they also invented cancel culture, being karens, and just generally toxic people.
can i catch trout on 10 pound test line? I bought a trout stamp and want to go fishing but I don't want to have to go to walmart to get 4 pound
That's pro fishing as a whole. Remember the pro walleye fisherman stuffing weights in the fish and got indicted on fraud?
Im a retarded faggot trying to teach myself baitcasters. Would a kind anon (with the 'tism) write me up a how-to? I have a handle on spinners, but baits are new2me. Im autisitic so be clear and consice. I dont want to watch "hey youtoobe its dicklicker 
299347, and im gonna spend 25 minutes bitching and 10 seconds showing"
Tiddies for attention.
tf are you talking about
spool tension knob, #5 on pic related, loosen it completely, then wobble your spool back and forth inside the baitcaster. Tighten the spool tension until the spool stops going side to side, it's now completely adjusted and shouldn't be touched. Every once and awhile check the side to side play hasn't come back.
All adjustments are done with your brakes. Turn all of them on or max settings, get used to throwing lures. Load up the rod and slowly let the rod do the work, don't force it. Have your thumb on the spool at all times until you get used to it, as you cast, let off the pressure on the spool with your thumb and let the spool let out line on the cast but still having minimal enough pressure for when it starts to backlash, you can slow down the spool. 
When you get better, lower the brake settings.
Max out brake
Max out spool tension
Back off spool tension until you can wiggle the spool
Slowly add spool tension until it can't wiggle
Back off brakes as needed (heavy lure = less brakes; light lure = more brakes)
Lightly thumb the spool for more braking as needed (add thumb pressure as the lure is farther away from you or you risk a backlash because the spool is peeling line faster than the lure can pull it)
You can now baitcast
What if I go full on wiggle for max distance
Bass are ugly and stupid fish that retards put into rivers for no reason other than to fish for them. The number of water systems that have been invaded by some retarded niggerfaggot bubba who dumped a bucket full of largemouth into it is in the hundreds if not thousands. These fish eat anything that moves and can live nearly everywhere. They are like if carp were predatory in nearly every regard, including the fact they aren't even a good eating fish. They are ugly, stupid, aggressive, and for some damn reason keep getting put everywhere. These fish are the niggers of our waterways and I despise bass "fishermen" for what they have done to the ecosystems of the great North American continent.
Trout are beautiful and stupid fish that retards put into rivers for no reason other than to fish for them. The number of water systems that have been invaded by some retarded billy bob bubba who dumped a bucket full of trout of various species is in the hundreds if not thousands. These fish eat anything that moves and can live nearly everywhere as long as it's moderately cold. They are like if carp were predatory in nearly every regard, besides the fact they actually taste delicious. They are pretty good looking for a fish, stupid, aggressive, and for some damn reason keep getting put everywhere. These fish are the PNW rednecks of our waterways and I despise trout "fishermen" for what they have done to the ecosystems of the great North American continent.
Bass live in cold, warm, temperate, clear, murky, muddy, LITERAL FUCKING SEWAGE, grassy, woody, rocky, sandy, silty, running, still, and fishtank water. This cannot be said about trout. Show me one video of someone catching a trout on a literal block of wood and I'll give you calling them stupid fairly. Until then, bass are the most retarded "game fish" there is.

The fish sense there's a bitch on the other end of the line.
He did let me bum his cigarettes mercilessly, so it's not like he was a complete pain. Regardless it got to a point where I had to explain blunt as fuck "I go fishing to relax, not to fucking cater to people who want to come along, if you want to come and you can't be helpful, at least don't be a pain in my ass."
He's better now but last time we went fishing he borrowed my penn slammer III and rod, it had a stuck drag due to buying used and I told that motherfucker so many times not to try to unwind it as the reel will fall off. 
Guess what that nigger did knee deep in the surf.
I got the fucker serviced and he paid half, but holy fuck, some people are better left at home if they're gonna cause you consistent problems and bring a whiney attitude.
Not that any of my seething has anything to do with your girlfriend wanting to spend time with you. If I were you, I'd offer to plan some girl friendly trips for her so you two can chill while she whips lures around like a sexy idiot. If she wants to come on a regular trip, tell her to assume it'll be uncomfortable and she might bring her big girl pants.
Good luck anon and smack your girl on the ass for me.
raping fish on an industrial scale?
based
based
kill all invasives
You're dealing with the fishing equivalent of "that guy".
He's the person those cheap Wal-Mart spincast kits were invented for.
When "that guy" wants to come fishing, you save the good stuff for people that won't googan the fuck out of it, and tell him to fish with the Spider Man Zebco, or bring his own shit .
Colors:
Maybe chartreuse as well. Those will cover every forage you're likely to find. Good luck and plz post more NorCal fish/cliffs
Best bet is low light conditions and use a moving lure. I would just buy 6 or 4 pound though
Honestly I probably be throwing white or pink in those conditions, but I'm weird and also don't fish where you fish. I find that white almost glows in slightly off colour water and I like that, it's like a beacon swimming through the water that says 'eat me'
Not great, telescopic rods in general kinda suck
Oof
Time to call the wattanty department 
Yup that'll do it. If you're pulling hard points your rod straight at the snag and just pull with the line.
You'll be fine, especially with moving baits that focus on reaction strikes
buy a daiwa procyon
me swinging on every piece of eel grass thinking it's a bite
Damn..
Nibbly fuckers this weekend but bluegill always deliver.
Jann’s netcraft
What's that fly?
brassie I tied, used hareline peacock dubbing for the collar
Ice dub brassies are Hella
not gonna type out a novel. check out any behind the scenes of pro tourney angling shit is beyond embarrassing and there is nothing sporting about these people.
not as pretty as peacock herl but a helluva lot easier to tie 10 of em up
Easier and faster to tie and more durable. Real peacock does look better but I doubt the fish care
I used to get embarrassed and wouldn't swing on everything, but then I kept on reeling in a bare hook and I don't care if I look like a goober anymore. Corbina are tricky to get a hookset on and I resign myself to looking dumb.
until they ban livescope/electronics, tournaments are pointless
pretty much lmao, reason why miliken is killing it is because he's a wizard with livescope
I've never used it, so I can't say if it is or not, but watching his videos showing throwing a big, fast sinking glide bait and watching it light up on the livescope as it falls in the water column and suddenly fish come out of no where to see it....that's....yeah.
I fucking hate rainbows and browns. Retard gorilla niggers keep dumping them in our waterways and displacing/hybridizing the native cutthroats. At least the tiger trout can't reproduce.
I like browns, since they are from my homeland they might be relatives so I don't kill them. They also took over areas from natives via interbreeding and disease resistance just like my people, so if I can't justify their being here then I can't justify my being here.
Large sunfish are underrated. They fight harder than any other fish per weight and I often confuse them for bass until I see them.
I agree. Catching big sunfish on ultralight is so much fun
Thanks homie
Ok smallie for me today.
Legendary.
Average bow fisher
Why do the most fattest Americans just decide? I'm gonna live in the hardest part of America.
Don't bully him, he is just getting some carp fertilizer for his garden. :(
How does one let themselves become such an obese, disgusting creature? Burn more calories than you consume it’s not fucking hard. Could never wrap my head around it. 
YBS Youngbloods and SurvivalBeast YouTube channels have some great bow fishing and spear fishing content
Good for them if they've pieces of trash like you who watch them I don't want to watch their videos why do I care about watching someone fish if they're not teaching you how they do what they do. Fuck YouTubers who just make fishing videos but don't share their techniques. If some people like just watching for the entertainment that's all them I don't I look for talented YouTubers who are starting out and try to pick them up as a platform to build a community of anglers who are new but seek to help others. I say screw all the popular fishing YouTubers. They they want to help the little guys starting out so that's what my goal is and if I manage to help new anglers who have channels pass me even better.
lmao relax bud they make good content to sit back, relax and enjoy while our water is frozen. If you want tutorials find different channels
100% this fat nigger gave himself string slap
Don't forget to use dry fire drills, they can help you with your aim and release point without even having to leave the couch
No problem bud!
Impulse bought this because I want to fucking fish this weekend and I haven't in like 15 years. I'm in Northern VA near DC and plan on going to the Potomac this weekend. Just got a freshwater license too and know the boundaries that my license applies to. Did I fuck up? I also bought a cheapo tackle kit and a radio to listen to comfy music. Anything else I'll need I have a small Ace hardware bucket.
I'd just get some hooks, a bobber, and some worms desu. It's how I started back into it a year and a half ago after not fishing since I was a kid and I had fun. Having the initial fun sparked an interest, then I did a lot of research to get into more techniques and now really into fly fishing.
Thanks, I got this, do you recommend real worms (maybe this is a retarded question)?
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VJMHL57
But realized it doesn't come with line. My coworker recommended a 12lb line so I'll look for that before Saturday.
?
clearly he's not doing enough physical activity
I mostly give him shit because he is the biggest murican stereotype there is. Fat, fat wife, dumb as a brick, barely literate and gets upset very quickly
Went fishing and saw this interesting boogie board any clue who the character is
That's That's the Florida fishing dude hes the most passive aggressive a****** ever
He hasn't lost any bit weight for like more than a year since he starts blogging and posting his shitty fat ass in this general.
At least I can call Skid a degenerate gay furry fat fuck without him being defensive about it.
Deedlit from RoLW?
Dubs confirm both true
Unless you have good experience with fishing, that tackle box actually seems to be a bit overkill and for larger fish. I would recommend getting some smaller hooks that panfish (bluegill) can eat. Real worms, not fake worms. 12lbs line is also probably overkill, I'd go with 8lbs monofilament. Doesn't sound as tough because 12>8 but for a first fishing outing you should be trying to go for bluegill and such and 8lbs will be plenty for good sized bass as well. Advantage of lighter line is that you'll be able to cast farther.
If you want to learn how to fish, I recommend just getting these 2 baits. Get small EWG hooks and throw them weightless, this is called free-rigging. Let it slowly flutter and then pop it. I never get skunked at heavily pressured urban city parks and locals think I'm a fishing wizard. I've frequently shown locals where the exact spots fish will hide, throw my plastic at the spot, and immediately get either a dink bass or a panfish. Every time. 
Just fish urban parks, you'll quickly learn how fish stick to structure and how they respond to stuff, where what species will be at, etc. If it's sunny and the sun is beating down on the water and there's no current, no moving water, fish are going to be ALL located in shade. The sunnier, the better since the spots will be very minimal. There's a key point.
Oh my god
Not counting when I'm catfishing, I have used inline spinners probably 90% of the time I've been fishing so far this year, and it's been fuckin great
I wonder if a spotty will eat an inline spinner. I kind of bought them for memes
I don't see why not, they love underspins and tailspins
Anon you should be more worried about the back taxes you owe to the IRS.
With all do respect to the boys on here I honestly don't get that upset about what people say about me online. It's more upsetting for me that having to explain to my wife who doesn't understand how sad people really are online that she is scared to in front of the camera because she was bullied growing up. She said to me she doesn't know how I can handle the way people treat me online I tell her at the end of the day honey these losers who have so much hate in their life that the only enjoy they get is to make others feel like shit. And you also have people who feel what your doing is a threat to some thing they are doing. I was trying to explain to her at the end of the day you could be 5'10 and weigh like 120lbs and people online will still judge you if I wasn't fat they be targeting my teeth so some times you just gotta troll them back and always remember we have the upper hand not them they're online when they come to us and say that on some thing we control then we and play there games like I said to her these jokers online have yet to come say anything to my face I'm not here to act like a tough guy online but I've been looking for some one to step up one down and catch me out fishing and try they trash talk because I'd love to throw a few I've had a itch for awhile to either kick someones ass or at least lose a fight trying cause some times a good bar fight wakes you up.
TLDR; No hard feelings hate me my wife and our dream of running a fishing club / bait shop / charter. Sorry we are obese.
Grade A wagu faggotanDtsry
Faggotry*
Idea:
Import Bowfin to germany and stock them here together with bass.
Yesss import bowfin, what could possibly go wrong?
thanks for this advice, I'll pick up some small hooks and line, worms and bobbers tomorrow night so I'm all set. Rod should be coming tonight and I've been researching where I want to go Saturday morning. Lets goooooooooo!!
How many worms do I buy for a day of fishing?
How do I learn how to put line on my rod/spinner?
One package will be plenty, and youtube. If you only learn one knot learn the uni knot
Classics are classic for a reason
as I said barely literate. not going to read the rest since it reads like bookreport from an eight year old
Got a double the other day, on a dry-dropper rig. One hit the popper and the other chased down the flashback nymph, was fun
what the hell are you talking about mate? Are you the bow fisher?
Why should i tie the double uni knot If i can tie a Albright knot?
no reason, albright is slimmer and just as strong if not stronger than double uni.
Though in the end it wont make a world of difference in most cases
Thank you
I guess i will practice it then
Yes do this
Keep marking me as spam every time I tried to reply to this comment so I had to screenshot my notes to send this.
what's his youtube channel?
didnt he also bot subsribers that eventually got nuked
I'm sure hes gonna read this and post it
That's funny he would buy subscribers because I'm pretty sure he comments and defends his posts on 4 Chan Playing it off as if he had someone back him
Have you tried not being detestable
Aren't you the guy that got pissy and mutilated a bunch of fish for no reason when people told you to fuck off
Yup that's him.
what a fag
Caught a golden trout with a zebco slingshot and a joes flies spinner. Second trout I ever caught and fought damn hard.
what part of the US are you in where you can catch these? We have a few lakes with this brook trout subspecies (aurora trout) a couple hours from me, thinking of making a trip to try and catch some this year.
West Virginia panhandle
beautiful fish.
Dont hear people talking about zebco often, but I feel like they are quite decent. I use a zebco trophy telescopic rod as my main travel rod and its been treating me very well
Its a 10 dollar combo, really good deal. I want to get a baitcaster soon but I thought I would pick this up to try out breaking right before roots and other baitcaster activities before I put real money up.
what are good walleye lures/plastics for end of may-early june?
Google "bad dragon", thick and solid bodies on them
Backstory?
"Golden" or Palominos trout (mutant rainbow trout) are often stocked along side rianbows. Usually a few hundred normal rainbows get stocked with a few bananas get thrown in for fun.
known felon on the USFWS watchlist
Don't tell me he hurt the sawfish...
Someone made a comment about how bad he was handling his catch so he post a bunch of picture of him killing his catches and saying that people are just jealous that he is catching fishes
I now don't like him. >:(
look at it his gorilla grip is squishing the life out of it. poor thing got folded in half like a taco.
also true
Which color of Tyrant did you get? I wanted the Henchman color but missed the drop by a few hours.
Bowfin =/= Snakehead you retard.
I'm pretty sure in Florida you are not allowed to take those out of the water you can get charged with I believe a fine at the very least did anyone report him?
This thread is about dead so I'll get back to you cool cats in the next thread mean time I'll leave you with a picture to save.
Yes we take them out of the water all the time when they're wrapped in fishing line to get the line off them and release them back into the water. We honestly don't really care what you liberals think about us removing that fishing from the water. We just respect the FWC wish and NOAA Fisheries by not posting pictures of them out of the water anymore on social media. 
If you really want to act like you care you can send the picture and give them our address maybe we can make a video laughing at nothing happening.
Mice and men ever read that book?
Too soon anon...
'conspirator', the one that isn't fully trout colored all the way, could only get 1 and a battleshad, wish I got 2 tyrants after seeing that rigging video, shit this is going to be fun to fish
Nope I don't find a need to read any books that aren't a source of knowledge I rarely ever watch TV or movies for that matter. I like to use as much of my brain space for knowledge not potato. As hard as that may be to believe. 
But I spoke with FWC about my concerns I had about me having that picture with the sawfish the officer I spoke with advised I don't post the pictures on social media because it would make more people think it's okay to do that.
But I assure you that if you think I care if any of you report me to FCW or NOAA I'm not in the least worried about them doing anything to me. It's almost like swatting as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully they will come for you for wasting their time on something they already handled.
Not like I'm keeping the sawfish protected fish or not I'd rather remove my line and crimp the hook then to just cut the line on that sawfish but it's okay. There's no way to justify my actions in the picture of me holding that sawfish that way I would agree to this day doing that was a huge and embarrassing thing to do. But at the same time I use that picture as a perfect example for others to never do that kinda shit which is why I started what I have going with my LLC but we still catch fish and kill them for bait I'm sorry if that offends you. Sometimes we go fish for invasive fish like the Mayan Cichlids and just leave them to die on land or keep them for cut bait.
ha! america is becoming more and more like germany
i need some snaps but i don't know what size, basically as small as possible for some shallow cranks
I use the smallest size VMC crank snaps (CRS#00) and smallest size Gamakatsu Duo Lock snap swivels (size 12). I dunno if the crank snaps really make that much of a difference, but they should in theory. it's best to remove the split ring from lures when using them though to offset the added weight. the snap swivels are retardedly expensive for a 5 pack but they are extremely small and quality.
the topwater popper bite has been on fire lately. I think a fethered treble in the rear really makes a difference.
i only use snap swivels on my ultralight stuff since sunfish don't give a shit
snaps are just handy for crankbaits
I use them for all kinds of shit because I don't like tying knots and I switch lures a lot. I've even used those small snap swivels on ned rigs with straight braid and still caught bass.
yup, the idea that bass are line shy is a ridiculous notion
look at a deep diving jerkbait and how much shit hangs off of it and tell me with a straight face that line visibility makes a difference
The only problem I've ever had with bass and snap-swivels is they being more interested in the swivel, than the lure.
Switched to black finished ones, that solved the problem.
Caught a cobia im the mangroves last week.
First time fishing mangroves. Was one of the best experiences of my life.
good fish
Imagine having to avoid TV and books because your brains can't keep up
Don't worry we can tell
Nice fish anon
Which one do you use? I've been looking for a telescopic rod but no one will give me just an honest opinion on one
I hate fishing.
Everybody ist catching nice fish but me. 
All i do is snag up and rip my line off
what kind of fish and gear you using?
Yo dude, keep working. Stick with it and build that skill, the fish will come. Enjoy nature thoroughly.
Happens, had weeks where all I got where sunburns, snags and skunked. Whole days sun up to sundown wasted.
Maybe take a little break for your mind, but don't give up. You'll get there
Was this your weird writing or did you get scolded by the feds?
Zebco Trophy mpx 80. It doesn't have a lot of line guides though

Is wearing socks with sandals degenerate?
Just being you is the greatest filter of all, trust me.
feel like most of the advantages to wearing sandals go away if you are also wearing socks with them, doesn't make it wrong but more like if you need the additional warmth/protection of a sock then a real shoe/boot also probably makes sense. doesn't make the sock sandals wrong and if 90% of your trip is sandal weather and just need socks for some cold evenings or something. 
style wise it will not get you laid but who cares about that when you are out?
Wise words.
Wearing socks with Chacos is easily the most comfortable footwear in the outdoors. I've done a few 14ers in them. Never had a problem getting laid, and I even turned a gf around on the issue.
If you're getting away with socks and sandals, you're not even technically /out/ imo.
You're right. Longs, Blanca, and Princeton are indoors.
btw why don't they make the sole from some breathable material? It's pretty shit standing on and sweating in that plastic/rubber shit.
Wool socks, sandals, and rubber overboots and gaiters for foul weather. 
Probably a good budget footwear system. Will need to do my own research...
wool Socks+sandals is peak modular outdoor footwear.
Protects sole-check
Breathable-check
Fast drying- check
Warmth- check (you're obviously not wearing these in the snow)
For me, it's the xero z-trail
Just got my first pair of Chacos after wearing Teva for 30 years and I gotta tell you, the footbed is amazing. I don't even have bad arches.
Ive heard that these are really uncomfortable and bad for stream crossings. Really light though
Guy is writing checklists on the feasibility of wearing socks with sandals
Yes, if you're not used to walking barefoot.
uncomfortable
Yes, if you're not used to walking barefoot.
I haven't had any problems
Germans travel across the entire planet wearing that

fuck off
I actually wore socks + sandals in the snow when it was (barely) freezing out-- obviously not for heavy snow but for intermittent on the trail it was great. I run warm though.
I live in a very wet part of the country but for some reason socks + sandals in the rain doesn't really bother me, especially with wool socks.
Out in public? Kind of weird. Innawoods? What the fuck else am I going to wear when I'm at camp and the sun starts going down. I just spent all day in my boots, I want to let my feet breathe a little bit without getting cold/bug bites.
Sock protects your skin and absorbs sweat that would otherwise pool under your sole, while still being way more breathable than any shoe.
It's based and makes normies have a meltdown
Add in dipping them in a cold stream and you've got yourself an evening
Id hate for women to wear this because their feet are so sexy
Lesson learned: always check your socks for snacks
It's the Czech standard.
romans conquered half the world wearing that shit
Wearing sandals is degenerate nobody wants to see your ugly ass feet.
So you're okay with socks and sandals then?
Flip flops without socks are better. Whenever you see photos of Asians or Africans, they're wearing flip flops, and they spend their entire lives living outside.
Of course not OP, everyone else is missing out.
do it OP! become a honorary aryan
I think it's kinda neat.
No...just incredibly retarded. You want your feet to not be inside of a shoe and more exposed to air, so why wear a sock?
It's likw peoplw who wear long sleeves with shorts...what's wrong with you? You're cold on the arms but hot on the legs? Makes no sense.
Hey fuck you that big ass blood thing in my toenail from last summer is nearly gone.
Dude you clearly don't go /out/. You wear long sleeve shirt to protect you from the sun. You wear socks with sandals to protect your feet from the sand but still being comfortable in camp. Desert camping clearly isn't your expertise (nor is /out/)

What's your current weight limit for the kinds of outdoor activities you do?
To qualify for our team we must carry a 30kg rucksack 50km in 24 hours. The elevation gain is about 2,400m.
no idea, ive never cared enough to weigh my kit
25 lbs max. - for multiday peak bagging in the Alps, forest after work, rucking, day hiking etc.
35 lbs for mountain treks or hiking on civilized trails
50 lbs for offtrail, taiga/tundra, subarctic - overload to 70 lbs for up to 3 weeks of food.
What does this equal in civilized scale?
About 8 and a half stone.
54,431 grams
Sounds reasonable for a pt test. Where can I join and what are the benefits?
just recently got a finnish surplus framed backpack and did a test load of about 20kg 
(44 lbs) on a mini hike of about 10km. It works like a charm but the knee joints hate it. Will proably use it with hiking poles if going for such weight and longer hikes.
you should carry no more than a quarter of your fit (normal) body weight, some say a third but I think that is too much weight long term
3 weeks of food by carrying 70 pounds? I would carry that for sure. Not going to buy a $90 rape whistle because it's one ounce less than the $3 one, and I'm also not going to cart around 120 lbs of bullshit.
Might be 80 pounds if you want to eat exactly the calories you need. I find that starting at 60 pounds the mileage you can put out exponentially diminishes so its not really worth it to carry more than 3 weeks of food since you'll walk about the same distance in 4 weeks carrying 80 pounds as you'll do in 3 weeks carrying 60 pounds.
It's about 1/4 the weight of your mother.
If I put my bag on and can't walk around the room with it, it's too heavy.
about 50lbs before food, that way I can bring it on a plane. People always tell me that I carry too much, and then they break something and need a replacement / repair. I also sleep very comfy.
Then everyone clapped

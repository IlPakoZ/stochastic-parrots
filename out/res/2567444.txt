Why are they such bitches? Are they wannabe forest rangers? Why don't they clean the damn toilets? Are they zogbots? Why do they come running up as if I won't pay the campsite fee? Why do they always have yappy little dogs? Why do even exist?
Why are they such bitches? 
Because we deal with cunts like you, all day, all night.
Are they wannabe forest rangers? 
No. We'd shoot you if we had guns.
Why don't they clean the damn toilets? 
Twice a day is the standard. The problem is the swine guests who spray shit all over the place like they don't have to clean up after themselves and they have no self-respect, it seems.
Are they zogbots?
No. 
Why do they come running up as if I won't pay the campsite fee? 
Because the first sign of a lowlife deadbeat is procrastination.
Why do they always have yappy little dogs? 
Bear alarms.
Why do even exist?
People overgrown mental vacationists like you come and slop up the pristine wilderness, but beer cans, plastic, and fucking lawnchairs in the firepits, move picnic tables onto the beach, into the lakes, and just fuck off like they are 4 years old going to watch cartoons now.
Because they are old uppity boomers who got everything they want in life except real power over people so now they are given the slightest bit of power and they are gonna abuse it. Its the same as old cunts in home owners asscioations and stratas.they derive a fucked up satisfaction out of making people miserable.
We get it, your moms boyfriend didnt get you that gay pink DS when you were a kid and now hate all CIS people and classify them as boomers due to low iq
i don't know who the fuck you're talking about
If you're going to bitch about people who manage public land, why don't you just buy your own private land?

Being compelled to support himself is slavery don't you know.

Did a hip camp in Austin. My 3 year old played and jumped on the trampoline with their 4 year old. Had a great weekend. Not all hosts are faggots.

When it did it become taboo to complain about anything on here?
hip camp
Whining was never cool
What kills me is that I used to have a few favorite places to camp for free in my local national forest, and then the NFS decided to turn them into RV campgrounds. Suddenly we have pavement, trees and vegetation removed, boomers with huge RVs and generators, muh authoritah campground hosts, outrageous fees, etc. And here in this thread we have cucks defending the hosts who would never have disgraced this national forest if it wasn't for the new "improved" campground.
Does this include all the people who endlessly complain about the board's quality?
No
My local state park hosts are literally my cousins. Feels good man. We camp for all told a month out of the year, even tho we only get like 3 growing months up here. Heck it snowed today, and we're camping for a week coming up on Thursday.
Anyhoo, sorry they are dicks where her from, OP. Can't imagine what that'd be like.
Yeah, doesn't feel good man now. Hope they get replaced I guess.
I went to a nearby national forest a few weeks ago to walk a few of their trails and check out the lake to see if it would be nice to fish there. I got to the entrance and needed to pay $4 to get in, and the park ranger on duty told me that every RV spot was full so I assumed the place was going to be super crowded. I start walking through some of the trails and didn't see anyone else, so I go check out the late, no one there either. There's not even kids playing at the playground or the obstacle course, no one using the archery range, no one using the public grills. It was completely empty. On my way out I decided to drive through the RV parking and every single person was just sitting in their RV or a tent next to a car.
When my buddy was camp host he made me a beer coozy out of aluminum foil

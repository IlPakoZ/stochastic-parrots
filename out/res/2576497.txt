New thread new thread new thread
How well does corn handle transplating? Wondering if they can be stared off in smaller seedling trays and then transplatend to bigger ones with no problem, of if they grow fast with a tap root and should be started off only in bigger containers where their root system is not likely to get cramped.
I haven't seen many people talk about or even mention this method for growing strawberries. I kind of just threw it together and the plants have been thriving. They're off the ground so the ants can't get the fruit and you are basically growing dozens of plants on about one square foot of garden space. I took this picture about two weeks ago and so far, they've just been throwing out new flowers and leaves constantly. Makes me want to see what other plants I can grow in this style? I wonder what a scaled up version of this bucket (say 50+ gallons) would do for a smaller backyard garden? Could say, 10 corn stalks grow through holes in the side, vertically up, like a tall, pointed crown? What about hundreds of carrots or a dozen pepper plants? Feels like vertical gardening just makes too much sense; especially if you're able to fill the bucket with mycelium for bonus mushrooms to sprout and enrich the soil.
birdos are gonna get em if you dont net
I've grown corn in containers a little under 250L / 1 cup in volume, and transplanted them. Had about 14 hardy corn stalks grow last year and got about 2-3 ears out of each. You can start them indoors, but eventually they need to go outside for a week or two to harden up and get some sunlight.
Also make sure conditions aren't too wet early on, even in whatever kind of container you start them in. Water enough to keep the soil damp, but not soaking wet. I'd recommend looking at the forecast and transplanting when conditions are going to be mostly dry. I've had issues with corn seedlings drowning and dampening off, and was saved by leaving them outside during the warm sunny days.
Finally, make sure each seed has it's own container. The roots will grow and extend rapidly, even within a week, so putting them all in the same tray with cardboard-tier separators is just gonna be a headache for you and you'll probably end up damaging the roots when you go to remove them for transplanting. I actually just forced my friend to dig up all his corn seeds out of a tray and gave him minipots to plant them separately lol. I just didn't want him to get all bummed out when it can time for transplanting, it sucks.
got like 80 corn seeds in a cell tray right now.
I think I will keep them indoors for 3-4 weeks and then plant outside.
What would be the optimal container size to hold over corn for 4 weeks indoors? (by ideal I mean as small as you can get away with)
These plants look really small to be fruiting. Are you sure they're not just stressed? Anyway, it seems obvious to me that this method only works with strawberries because you can pretty much grow them in any direction. You sure as hell cannot grow peppers let alone 8 feet tall corn stalks out of hole from the side of a bucket. They grow vertically and need a lot of space. You couldn't get one to germinate in your strawberry planter because light doesnt get into those holes and if you were to transplant a seedling in there it'd stick out sideways for starters, and it'd probably get all twisted trying right itself while it grows towards the light. Pic related is a better and more versatile type of vertical planter. Although it's probably still too small for peppers. Corn can only be grown in large containers for obvious reasons.
Isn't the bucket limiting the sun the plants get? Which could be fine for some things
yes, that's why you need to rotate them every so often so the shaded side gets light too
There's one major caveat to vertical strawberry planting. If you live in at least zone 6, the winter freeze will damage the root systems of the plants due to a lack of general insulation.
I forgot to mention that another drawback of your bucket method is that is it harder to make sure each plants get enough water because often the lower plants are much drier than the ones on the higher levels. With stackable planters you can water each plant individually.
Anyone care to weigh in on my project. Posted right before new thread unfortunately
80 corn seeds in a cell tray right now.
Dang that's alot! I think you'll be fine with the volume, I've even grown corn in dixie cups.
I think I will keep them indoors for 3-4 weeks and then plant outside.
They need to be outside for awhile once they sprout. If they look/feel soft, but are a few inches tall, they might survive transplanting, but won't grow past a foot or two high. I don't think using fans and UV lights will be good enough.
Pic related, It's a poor man's setup, but I can fit about 80 square nursery pots in a transparent plastic container with holes drilled in the bottom for drainage. I prop up the lids with tent spikes for ventilation, weigh it down with a bottle of water to keep the lid from blowing off and to deter those damn critters. Or instead of propping up the lid, I'll offset the lid by some angle so the box isn't closed all the way. If it's not too cold/wet I'll leave everything outside, even at night. Just throwing out ideas as to what you might want to do with your cell tray once the corn starts to sprout and you start moving things outside.

but won't grow past a foot or two high.
Wait, what, why?
Why did this come to /out/ and not /diy/? What's the lore?
I can go about a month in 2in blocks 
They transplant outside just fine. 
might start another tray in a few days
It's just the basics. If you plan on growing plants in trays or pots, they eventually need to be exposed to the outside elements (temperature fluctuations, wind). Especially wind, it's why indoor growers sometimes leave a fan running or why someone has a big industrial fan in their greenhouse. This is the 'hardening' process, and the roots and stems will start to strengthen and adapt so they don't get blown over by wind/rain or experience adverse affects after the temperature plummets/spikes.
The root system for corn also moves really fast and can extend up to a foot within two weeks (from my experience). But you have it in a small container. This means the root system will eventually ball up, and it needs water. But then it needs that water to fuck off since corn can drown pretty easily. A perfect day would be;
water tray in morning
roots get water
leave outside all day in the sun and wind
excess water drains, or is evaporated via sun and wind
roots won't drown in excess water
stems and leaves get sun and wind
things are nice and relatively dry by nightfall
...because cold and damp conditions can drown the corn and/or cause dampening off. But it needs water, and then it doesn't lol. I know it sounds like a contradiction, but if the root system isn't used to this cycle, and the stems and leaves aren't used to the elements, the transplant shock your corn will suffer will be pretty bad and stunt its growth. It just won't grow past a couple feet, and it might flower, but the plant won't be big and strong enough to grow a full size ear. It would just fall over it actually did.
And if you leave a tray of corn outside, the birds and chipmunks will actually dig up the seeds and eat them lol. So you need some kind of cover or protection. And once the corn does sprout, deer will eat anything green because fuck deer. So now you're going need a fence or something to keep them out as well. Just some advice.
correction; 
It would just fall over *if* it actually did (grow an ear).
Corn is traditionally sown straight into the ground. You're not 'really' supposed to grow corn in containers, but you can. I have. Just because it grows fast doesn't mean it's as strong as the rest of your stuff. It's actually very susceptible to alot of things early on. And time is against you since corn can also get root bound very quickly, so from pot to garden in a month is a good idea, you just need to make sure you are hardening the corn as much as you can by leaving it outside or being creative with your setup.
Are ants good for you? r garden.
high in protein
pic related is the cell tray I have my corn in.
My guess is for best results, I should transplant the corn 1 week in after it's sprouted.
What I'm hearing is that it's free chicken feed?
yees zis looks very good
Probably not. The tunneling aerates the soil but ants have a nasty habit of farming aphids and chewing up roots.
My guess is for best results, I should transplant the corn 1 week in after it's sprouted.
You can wait longer than that, those are still babies. Just make sure you harden them off for a week or two outside.
the picture is of strawberries, those can stay in those cells for a long time starting off.
The corn however....
Speaking of which, what is the earliest you can plant corn outside? Temps during day, during night? Soil temps?
I like all the gardening Pepe posts
The second dandelion bloomed today. The sunflowers are about an inch tall.
How do you like this mix?
What do you know about day lillies
almanac.com/gardening/planting-calendar

What meme veggie should I grow?
chocolate bhutlah
1) Post a scheme &amp; photo of materials.
2) I, probably just like people form most of the world, do not understand the american slang for timber.
 wood finish that won't hurt plants
I think most commercial wood finishes are fine (once they dry). I use some drying oil finish for outdoor wooden constructions such as trellis for grapes.
The only ones I'd avoid are those used for phone/electricity poles and railroad ties, but I believe these are not sold to individuals.
 wind protection
Can't you just form an 'L' from your trellis?
If not, add a diagonal wooden struts (perpendicularly to your trellis) or tie it with two sturdy strings.
Looks awesome.
i regonise the perlite, what else you got in there?

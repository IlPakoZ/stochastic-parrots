Do you guys hunt with PCP airguns or take them with you when you go outside?
What airgun do you have or what it's your favorite?
I'm planning on buying one to hunt rabbits and some birds.
got me a co2 going to upgrade it with a 20" barrel and a stock to make it a little rifle with a scope.
Airgun hunting is max comfy. I hunt rabbits with a .177 FX Cyclone and JSB Monster 13.4gr.
Why air guns ?
As a cucked European i have no idea.
Are there advantages to regular guns or is it about laws ?
Air guns are not firearms in law, so you can get away with a lot more.
My air rifle has a suppression system built into it, it sounds like a cough when I fire it.
I use it to kill rabbits mostly.
There is no advantage a PCP has over 22lr that isn't based on the fact that they are not legally firearms. The guns are more expensive and the cost of filling tanks or buying special compressor far outweigh the cost of a 22lr. You're looking at like $6-8 hundred initial investment plus running cost for entry level PCP. I'd love one but the cost just doesn't work out unless you live in some overly restrictive shithole. They do look very fun tho. I have a springer and a piston and that will likely be it for my air gunning unless the price comes down significantly and given the economies of scale I don't see that happening.
Special compressor
Imagine being such a beta cuck that you don't own an air-compressor or pneumatic tools. 
This. You can buy an Airforce Texan that is basically a sniper rifle with zero firearm restrictions and you can even get fully auto PcP. It's a massive loophole in the liberal retardation referred to as "gun control"
Air guns are much cheaper per-round and if you live within the city limits there are less legal penalties for firing them at things like Starlings, crows and rats. The PCP rifles can be suppressed so they're usually quieter and PcPs have are cheaper if you already have a compressor (like every real man should).
You can't pump these PCP guns with a normal air tool compressor dumbass. That's why ppl need to take it to a dive shop or have one of those high pressure expensive compressors that are like 500 bucks to fill. If they did work off your little craftsman compressor then of course they'd be more popular than they are.
or have one of those high pressure expensive compressors that are like 500 bucks to fill
calls someone else a dumbass
A vertical compressor with good pressure is exactly what he's referring to, moron. Guys who are handy and who don't live in tiny efficiency pods in the middle of a concrete wasteland will nearly always have a vertical, high-pressure compressor. Your reference to a dive shop alone (an auto garage would do) is a dead giveaway of a west coast urbanoid with no life or practical skills.
- t. working engineer/fabricator
or buying special compressor
LMAO
thee things are like 40 dollars in aliexpress, are very easy to use and have good quality
You can't pump these PCP guns with a normal air tool compressor dumbass
Retard, I've been using these things for like 7 years and use these >>2541502
Now I have a venturi avenger and works fine
How much time does it take you to pump up to usable pressure? How many shots do you get per charge?
I am poor, don't know anything about tools and am a beta-cuck
Based compressor chad.
It varies by rifle/caliber. 
It will tell you in the rifle specs.
Those standard shop compressors are like a couple hundred psi at best. Not suitable for PCP filling. Now go look at the price of a compressor that meets the pressure requirement for PCP. Regardless you retards are proving my point in that even if the common shop compressor was usable how many fucking ppl have access to one such that it makes owning a PCP cheaper than a 22lr? Even if you buy entry level everything you could get a very nice rimfire for the price.
I'm poor
You can get a high pressure air compressor for like 300 USD. The hand pump is like 40 bucks. 
10,000 rounds of .22LR averages $700 USD
10,000 rounds of .177 pellets averages $150 USD
Basically I can buy a PcP and a high pressure air compressor for less than you'll pay in ammo and then I can charge Scuba and Paintball fags to fill up their shit and eventually the compressor will pay for itself.
20 minutes of pumping for 20 shots. After that pellet have less power and are not really flying where you want them.
Btw. you should not pump it fast because pump can overheat and wont last long. 
Good PCP airgun costs like 800€. Then you can either buy pump for another 150-200€ or air bottle for 300-400€. Then you need to find someone who will fill it obviously.
So yeah, PCP will solve the recoil and noise of 400€ springer but replace it with other obligations.

Also, good luck shooting something after going through gym
€
Europoor confirmed
The irony here is you can't even own a .22 in Europe without a costly loicens.
Your post makes obvious you don't know shit about guns at all.
Gun license cost 500€ + lets say 1000€ for proper gun that shoots real ammo, its still better deal than buying PCP airgun.
Did you enjoyed your pumping today?
pic related, multipump, it's fun, it's cheap, ammo is cheap, load single hunting pellets if needed
this won't get outlawed with new laws (in USA)
cute
Lol, lmao even. Your best defense is to call me poor while not being able to provide a single evidence that pcp has anything over 22lr, whether that be cost or performance. The only thing PCP has going for it is to be able to say legally it isn't a firearm, which I conceed is a valid concern for some people. But for anyone besides ppl from nations with cucked gun laws it's not worth it and represents paying drastically more for worse in every regard.
I would prefer a spring/piston over pump. Only place pump makes sense is basement range with bullet trap for indoor fun.
What counter do you have to his argument besides calling him poor? He has laid out the ridiculous relative cost of getting into even entry level (but still good) PCP. There is literally no benefit other than to avoid legality of dealing with actual firearms.
multi pump is nice because you can pump once or many times, it's adjustable which I think it's better than spring
I don't know what pcp is, but I used to like the idea of getting these pump-action compressed air rifles. They're cheaper than guns, and don't require any legal shenanigans. I've shot a few and they're strong enough to hunt birds
Dam I forgot the image
It stands for pre charged pneumatic it's basically got an air tank just like a paint ball gun.
There are 3 types
1) simple like this >>2541673
you "break" the rifle and only have one shot, you break and reload, very quick and easy
2) the one OP posted
that is charged with these >>2541502 , you can shot an average of 25-30 shots per rifle depending on the pellet and rifle, sometimes those fuckers aren't so easy to charge if you are a sissy
3) rifles that use scuba
pic related, multishots, haven't used those 
The calibers are .177 .22 .25 and .30 and 9mm
In my experience, I have used these 
.177 you can kill birds and some rabbits if you hit them in the right place but also your rifle needs good fps
.22
perfect for any bird and you can also kill rabbits, foxes, dogs, etc. I've know people that have killed boars and pigs but shooting under the ribs or with a headshot with a powerful rifle
.25
birds are a mess after a shot them if you don't aim for the head. You kill rabits and other small animals no matter where you shoot. Perfect to hunt the same things that using .22 but have much more power and I personally like to use them when it rains or there are too much wind so the traectory isn't affected
.30
massacre birds, to the rest of animals only aim for the head, a boar is no problem for this rifle 
never tried 9mm
Oh the gamo air rifles that break like that are no longer 1 shot.
They have a 10 round mag now, standard.
newfag
Why are you insist on lying?
The only thing the pump guns are good for is when you want to piss off your friend or scare the neighbor’s cat. Single pump is much better that 20 pumps.
I like that co2 Crosman 1077 though. Don’t know if they still make them. Not as powerful as the spring piston ones, but it feels like plinking with a cheap .22 short rifle and I took out a opossum with it once.
working engineer
thinks 150psi vertical compressor is higher pressure than a 150psi pancake compressor
Weak.
Also it’s kind of gay listening to you guys arguing about this. Air rifles are fun because you can plink a squirrel in a suburban area without getting arrested, also you can convince your mom to get you a 1000fps gun when you’re 14 and tell her it’s just like a Red Ryder.
Of course air rifles are hella fun. But once you get into PCP it just gets obscene level expensive, where as you can buy a Savage MK II for 300 bucks on a bad day at terrible price. I guess like that one faggot says the price to get into it initially is higher but at some point the pellet gun would end up being cheaper than a 22lr but it would take years to even reach the break even point.
Shut the fuck up you are not going to start a side business pumping scuba and paintball you utter faggot. Just admit you would pay $500 for the gun and another $300 for the pump at the end of which you will not even come close to holding up to a $800 22lr. Not even a $400 one shooting good ammo. It'd take you years, likely decades to reach the break even point and have the PCP begin to be cheaper.
Ok back on topic what's everybody hunting with? Anybody got experience with the Diana Storm models for shit like squirrel and rabbit?
Also how are you faggots noticing your impact due to low temps or just general temp swings throughout the day?
I've been shooting PCPs for about a year, bought my first PCP last march, since then I haven't stopped, I've gone shooting nearly every odd weekend since then. In the left it's my .22 cal Artemis Pr900 and in the right my .25 cal Effecto PX-5.
They DO have an advantage though, most PCP air rifles are dead nuts accurate, even the cheapest ones. There's a steep initial investment but after that you can shot for very cheap. 
Yeah but you get a hell of a workout with anything but the smallest reservoirs. My gun had a 275cc cylinder, and after trying to pump it twice and nearly popping a vein I resigned and bought a tank.
I have an Artemis PR900 (the same thing really), regulated model, shoots around 22-24 ft/lbs. Mine has been wonderful, very accurate (single ragged hole at 35m), shots decently whatever you put it thru, mine likes JSB 18gr the best, but shoots 15gr JSB and crossman domed decently too.
I’m with you 50%. Depends on your locale. In Illinois, any air rifle >700fps velocity and >.177cal requires a FOID card, so you’re going through the exact same bullshit as buying a real .22 rifle.
What advantage does the regulated version give you? How had does the velocity and accuracy drop off between the first and last shot before your air runs out. I saw some posts online that shows the muzzle velocity dropping like several hundred FPS between the earlier and final shots.
Air guns are not firearms in law,
Some one needs to tell the Australian's this.
Also Canada for anything over 500 fps.
PCP is more expensive
I literally isn't you brain dead retard
The math is in this thread and you're just straight up stupid.
You keep repeating the same lie as if it hasn't been debunked.
Just admit you suck at basic math hand haven't even come close to refuting the math that debunks your retarded assertion that PcP is more expensive. It isn't--you're just retarded.
You also keep lying about the prices. so we've established you're a liar and retarded.
Had an FAC one of these in the UK. It's good as it comes apart and fits in my bag, took down some small game but wouldn't use it over an actual rifle
UK
aktual rifle
I use the pellet rifle more than anything else because it's cheaper by far and I hunt a lot of invasive species like starlings, crows and rabbits. I also have something most Europeans don't: land and hunting access.
Flatter shooting curve, which translates into better 'vertical' accuracy. As the pressure drops the velocity of the pellet decreases, giving you a lower POI. Some guns actually shoot faster with a lower pressure than max fill pressure (say, max fill pressure is 250 BAR, but the gun shoots the fastest at 200) because of less resistance of the hammer hitting the valve. 
A regulator "regulates" the air pressure into a lower level (usually 100-130 bar) so more, lower pressure air can be used for shooting. They maintain a more or less equal pressure along the shot string until the tank pressure reaches the regulator pressure.
Nowadays most newer airguns are regulated, it has become standard in the market. One of the few $500+ airguns that are still unregulated is the Benjamin Cayden, but it still achieves a somewhat consistent velocity thanks to other tricks.
I'm trying to do the math here.
Using American prices and shops:
- FX Dreamline .25 with Walnut stock: $1280
- 78cu CF Tank: $390
- 1000 rounds of FX Hybrid Slugs: $128 ($16 each with 2 free from Pyramid Air) $0.128 per round.
Total: $1798
- CZ 427 Varmint: $650
- Silencerco Sparrow 22: $299
- 1000 rounds of Eley Subsonic HP: $199
Total: $1240
Fixed cost delta is $558
Recurring cost delta is $7.2 per 100 rounds.
If you shoot 200 rounds every weekend, you'd save in ammo with an air rifle $748,8 a year ($14.4 * 52), meaning in 10 months the air rifle would have been cheaper.
Sure, you can not buy a supressor for the rimfire, but the FX Dreamline comes with a supressor, which does have its advantages. You could shoot cheaper ammo with the 22lr, but so could you with the FX Dreamline, shooting pellets.
In bong land it absolutely makes sense to get a PCP.
In burgerand there is also multi month wait times to get a suppressor plus a $200 tax in addition to the cost of the supp. Also fun fact although air guns are not legally firearms on a federal level, in many cities and towns they are considered so and it is technically illegal to discharge them in town, though enforcement probably varies and that depends on who hears or notices in the first place.
I was assuming OP was in the US.
FAC air rifle is the best way to go in the UK, if you get one that can come apart easily then you just throw it in your bag then you can get most game here easy
How does temps affect these guns? Where I am it's not unheard of for like 20 degrees or more of temp swings between early morning and afternoon
With CO2 there's temperature issues, but I have never noticed any issue in my PCP air rifles.
PR900 regulated is beautiful, I used it for several years before selling it, I almost bought it again to hunt this season (starts in april) but I think I'm going to buy the M16 5.5 instead.
Where are you from?
he pays the cuck stamp and waits the time
Lol
OP can't legally obtain a firearm is the only reason.
He can buy black powder firearms, if feeling spicy he can get conversion kits to hold modern cartridges.
Most places you can't just buy black powder though.
You can have it shipped directly to your door, but you need to use either FedEx or UPS, Fedex IMO, fuck UPS.
The PcP savings will eclipse the .22lr in two to three years depending on how much you shoot. 200 rounds a weekend is 10,400 rounds a year. I've had my 22 for over 20 years and no contest the PcP cost in that time is exponentially less.
Most cities have ordinances against hunting or discharging projectiles in the city limits. 
Fedposting
South america
I'm from South America as well. Chile?
Yes 
are you spying me?
No. I know our hunting season starts in April, that's all. 
Wanna go hunting? What do you hunt?
Liebres, caiquenes, pato jergon (they aren't so common in my zone) and some other birds. I know that people in my region has hunted boars and deers but never tried it because I only go for small animals and don't have dogs. I have a rifle 6.35 too and wold like to try but seems like a dumb idea since I need a plan and time to explore new zones.
I'm from the XI region btw.
Damn cool, I'm from Santiago so mostly hunt rabbits, tortolas and codornices, around here or a bit further south near Talca. 
I wanna hunt deer sometime, and maybe go to Tierra del Fuego and hunt beavers, that's kinda my dream. I have two air rifles and also I'm buying a u/o shotgun shortly.
How has your find held up in that time. Do you get caught lacking against the new developments or is it pretty much like rimfire where it's the same shit basically.
Yeah I'm sure after a few years it's worth it. How often do you have to replace fill tanks and shit I see ppl posting on air gun forums about that shit going bad and compressors being rebuild after a few years too. Honestly the PCP thing seems really cool but it also seems like a lot of additional investment and upkeep
For mostly hunting would something like Diana Storm Rider or Beeman Chief 2 suffice? Or should I pony up some cash for a venturi avenger? I don't care about rate of fire our squirrel limit is only 6 a day so I would be down with whatever is super accurate and light. The flimsy looking barrels on the chief and rider has me worried.
Very nice. Just noticed the can of cerveza cristal in the pic >>2541906 lmao. I don't know how did I miss that. 
also, my favorite poston to use with the PR was the JSB of 15gr, best by far in my experience
You should definitely come to these zones some day, the XI or the XII region, they are beautiful.
So does anyone in this thread actually own and shoot PCP? If you do post em so we can oogle
yes, the one on the left is one of the most economic and effective >>2541906
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FClBXyXm8s&amp;ab_channel=TyroneMclaren [Embed]
excellent to small game hunting
You can buy an Airforce Texan that is basically a sniper rifle with zero firearm restrictions
dude it's so cool it looks like a sniper rifle
The .50 caliber version can reach 800 ft-lbs, which you can reasonably achieve with .357 magnum from a 6" revolver, and the later will have a flatter trajectory and may hold more rounds in the cylinder than you'd get consistent shots on a single fill with the Airforce Texan. Small bore airguns are cool for cheap shooting, but big bore airguns are absolutely a fucking meme and well beyond the point of diminishing returns.
would use the 50 cal
no, already you have lost all credibility
The only good 50cal is an M2, the rest are total shit especially the "sniper" rifles in 50 cal. The only people that hunt 50 cal are black powder larpers.
Please stop talking about guns--you don't know shit about shit.
You misread the post esl retard. He is saying a 6in 357 mag revolver will btfo any 50 cal air rifle.
The irony is palpable.
The post you replied to states that 50cal is a shit caliber to use as a benchmark for anything. The comparison isn't just invalid it outs whoever is even talking about 50 cal as obviously not knowing anything about rifles.
Feel bad about having a worse reading comprehension than an ESL and feel even worse for talking out your ass about something you clearly know nothing about.
great, I love these types of guns
bump
what should I buy if I have a budget of 3.000 USD
Might be off topic from the thread but I'm a carpenter and never understood why they make so many types of air compressor? Used to use a pancake compressor but now I have a little one gallon quiet hot dog for trim jobs and a double cylinder 4 gallon for framing. Why not just make one cylinder? But there's also vertical compressor. I'm more curious than anything
a rifle
A nice 22lr and a very nice scope with a shit ton of ammo to go with it.
they're strong enough to hunt birds
I've hunt rabbits with mine as well.
stop posting 
your embarrassingly stupid
The tool companies got together with the compressor companies and decided modular wasn't profitable. The scuba and paintballers use the high pressure and the three levels of the lower pressure are industrial, auto, home and maritime*
scuba and maritime aren't the same.
I went over a bit but it's fine
Never owned an airgun before, looking to buy a handgun airgun for casual target practice, my priority is accuracy up to maybe around 80 yards (73 meters), I'd prefer to have one that requires pumping as lugging around and buying CO2 cartridges or another propellant system sounds like a pain and another thing to worry about. Are there any decent options that can be bought brand new for under $120 USD or so? I don't care about the calibre, not going to be hunting.
(I didn't mean to type 'pumping', in particular. I just meant that I didn't want one that had to be propelled with something that had to be bought and/or carried separately)
Owned many different airguns, PCP, spring and gas-ram. Hunted with them extensively. Picrel (Weihrauch HW95K) is still my favourite for hunting.
is that... is that a suppressor? 
on an air gun...?
Yeah, airguns can be loud as hell. They are not a firearm either, so you can just slap on one if you are in the usa.
all of them use supressors, pic related for example has it hidden in the barrel
If I don't use the supressor when I'm hunting my rifle is very loud and the animals can notice me from around 60mts when I shoot
diana stormrider gen 2 would be the perfect rifle for you because is the best for starters and also cheap
*the best for starters because
simple design
the weight its around 4.5 pounds 
great accuracy 
multishots
easy to fill with a pump like >>2541502
What the fuck are you shooting at random crows for you fucking imbecile?
Fun fact
Lewis and Clark took an airgun on their famous expedition
muh suppressors on spring rifles are pointless because when I fire my spring rifle, which has a suppressor fitted, I hear the rifle's internal mechanisms quite loudly.
Suppressors don't suppress a rifle's internal mechanisms. They suppress the muzzle report so that you can fire at multiple targets without scaring them away immediately with your first shot.
I sometimes sit in my backyard with an air rifle and shoot at Myna birds pretending I'm a Russian sniper in Bakhmut. I shoot a bird and watch it fall then I say something like "he was denazified" or "myna bird was liquidated in the backyard direction"
...holy shit.. 
it's..

Girardoni air rifle, yeah. Designed in 1779 by Bartolomeo Girardoni in the Holy Roman Empire. 19+1 capacity.
Co2 Is good
Oh.. fail...
ou're looking at like $6-8 hundred initial investment
fuck no, you can buy an used PCP for like 200$, if you catually inspect it you can get one that wasn't used at all for that money. And you can get a pump in aliexpress for 50$ that will be enough to fill any pcp up to 230 bar.
am I supposed to use the rifle just on the green zone? I understand that I won't have to fill it until the red zone, but what happens if I shoot when the rifle is in the yellow zone?
can someone has a video on this or something I could read?
Kral Big Horn .30 cal, yay or nay?
Yellow zone usually means it has fallen out of the regulator pressure and will shoot with less power... up to the point the pressure isn't enough to overcome barrel friction and you get a squib, but you'd have to shoot until the pellets are literally plopping out of the barrel to have that happen.
beautiful, one day Im going to buy one of these
Airguns were around for over 200 plus years before Lewis and Clark..
I shot something similar at a gun show.
Asked the guy how much it cost. He told me four and a half grand.
So I went and bought a gamo for 150 dollars. I only wanted it for rabbits in my yard anyway.
Might be some Daystate or something, that rifle in particular is like $700-800
It was a custom job. The scope on it was a grand and a half by itself.
If you go custom shit can get stupid expensive. Specially for benchrest or field-target. You see guys running top of the line Nightforce scopes on those competitions, and the scope is only a quarter of the price of the whole rig.
Any recommended break action pellet guns for rabbits and squirrels? Preferably in .22
I like my gamo swarm.
What's your budget? Rifle and scope?
he said break barrel.. scope is a no-go. holy shit wish people would stop putting scopes on those things... and put the rear irons/forward irons on the barrel only.. its a weird sight picture but at least you can fucking hit shit....
There are many "springer rated" scopes. If you put a random cheapo scope it's going to crap out, but if you put a Hawke or a UTG Bugbuster, they are specifically made for spring action air rifles. You need good mounts too, something like a 1-piece one
I have one of these with a match barrel. It's really accurate, easy to use. But underpowered for anything besides close-ish range. So much drop on the pellet in .22
In bigger calibers and heavy-weight pellets these can be strong enough to hunt men, anon.
In some rifles those mounts don't let you put the magazine, only pellet by pellet
PCPs have minimal recoil and can use whatever scope.
Airgunner here.
Some airguns are as deadly as regular firearms.
Most are gay bullshit, if they cant tell you the calibre of pellet, fps and propulsion its probably shit.
I didn't mean that. If you use a 1-piece mount in some rifles you can't put the magazine in it so you have to put a single pellet everytime you want to shoot
Look up regulated vs unregulated
If your rifle doesn't have a suppressor you only need one shot. Everything scatters after the first round. My pops bought a breach loader (because he's a retarded boomer and totally ignored me) to kill starlings and the thing is loud as fuck.
I've considered getting a suppressed air rifle for plinking cause i don't feel like doing the tax stamp bullshit for suppressors for my .22
Getting this scope tomorrow for my Kral Puncher, good or not?
Imagine buying airgun for the price of .22
Imagine saying something this retarded in a thread you obviously didn't read.
Avoid Turkish airguns.
I bought this and I'm nervous
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003374697568.html
this is the first time I buy an accesory like this in the chinese market, I didn't want to buy one in my country because the quality were very similar to chinese scopes but they were too expensive, almost the double even when most of them are from the same brands and hae the same specs
That scope looks great, what is the weight of your rifle? and what is the weight of that scope?
Why? I get the thing about cheap Turkish shotguns from no-name manufacturers, but air rifles are fine. Specially if you buy from well known companies like Kral or Huglu.
Diana and Airforce are known for quality products and have been in the business for awhile.
Because you can get Air Arms for the same price.
what scope
I find it's most helpful in colder climates. Puts a little pep in your step
Personally I prefer my .22 pcp over .22lr, I do a lot of squirrel hunting and .22lr does too much damage to the carcass to do anything with. Plus the added range you get from .22lr isn't gonna matter at the distances you'll be hunting squirrels at.
Nikon Prostaff EFR 3-9x40. I think their discontinued now. Great scope if you can find one though.
I'm getting a CZ 457 22lr/17hmr combo rifle after getting ridiculed with the PCP rifle in my latest hunt. We hunt in a vineyard and sometimes rabbits are rally far away, like 200m, I could never close in enough to get a shoot with my .25 cal air rifle. Since it's flat and featureless it's really hard to estimate range, I shoot at like 20 rabbits and got none. Also my rifle is heavy as fuck. 17hmr ought to do the trick.
That's a valid reason to go with a conventional firearm over a pcp, you have to get equipment that meets your needs. I'm just sick of all the sperging about how PCPs are pointless because 22lr exists
Diana
love diana outlaw
Bump. Buying this rifle this week.
esl europoo detected
Pumpfag detected
Turkish airgun for the price of Weihrauch or Air Arms. Enjoy.
It's pretty common for shit marksman to blame the rifle. Read between the lines: he was mocked for being a shitty shot not because of his PcP. 
Why are you buying a $500 gun to hunt rabbits when you can't even shoot straight. Get a Marlin for 1/4 the price and learn to shoot straight before you embarrass yourself any more.

what scope on the smaller rifle?? firewofl?
T-Eagle 3-9x40 AO IR
Surprisingly decent for being a cheap chink scope, I think it cost me like $90. Glass is clear, FOV is really wide. The only downside is the short eye relief.
if you're running PCPs, it's because you're an autist and just like them. aside from that? they're cheap for training, normal variable pump/break barrel models are as cheap as an equivalent .22lr for the gun and about 100x cheaper to shoot. you can get tins of 400 pellets for like $7. try doing that with .22lr or any other firearm. they're also generally a little bit lighter, much more quiet, and aren't legally firearms.
i like pellet guns because they're cheap, i can shoot cans all day and not feel bad about my wallet. they're also very simple to maintain, just a little oil (unless a seal wears out but that's never happened to me). i've had the same powerline 35 since i was 13, and i just picked up a crosman 1377 today. both are very fun to shoot, and i know the powerline 35 can take small game like squirrels. the 1377 can too but i need to get it sighted in right.
One of the reasons to like PCP airguns is that even the cheap ones are as accurate as match level 22lr. A .22 Airventuri Avenger pretty much shoots one hole groups within 50y with $23/500rn JSB pellets.
I feel bad for anyone who can't just get a 22lr rifle for under 200 bucks.
I feel bad for barely literate retards that post in threads they don't read.
Even PCP that cost more up front than a 22lr have a much lower recurring cost. 22Lr rounds are cheap but they're laughably expensive compared to PcP rounds. 1,000 rounds of .22lr is 200ish USD. 1,000 rounds of .22 pellets is 20is USD.
It is very easy to fire 1k .22lr rounds a year.
PCP also isn't considered a fire arm so you can get it suppressed without a worry.
Have that rifle in .177
I love my 22lr but I picked up a break action 22 that's dead nuts accurate at about 25yd. I love squirrel hunting and notice most shots are between 20-40 yds anyway. I'm gonna hunt with it this fall when the season opens to see how it hangs. Most of my motivation is the cost and also kinda safety since early fall there are a lot of bow hunters in trees and they don't rock the blaze orange. Hate to clap a guy with a 22lr.
You fucking jest. I too am an avid squirrel hunter and have never had the ammo do too much damage. In fact I specifically use 22lr because it does minimal damage. Pic rel were all shot with CCI Std hollow points.
I use a break action .177 "around the house" for squirrels, Crows (suck it crow lovers), and starlings and a .22lr innawoods. I fire significantly more .177
The irony here is you can't even own a .22 in Europe without a costly loicens.
Not true, no license required here.
nice
why do you hunt squirrels?
It's fun and they're good eating.
poor lads, they never had a chance
You can own airguns in the vast majority of Europe. Half the advantage is laws, the other half is that they're quiet, cheap to shoot and are generally pretty safe to hunt within areas where other people might be about. 
Legality obviously plays into it but its not the only reason you'd hunt with an airgun.
There are advantages but if you're hunting with an airgun you're doing it to airgun hunt for the challenge. 
Also, refilling a dive tank is not expensive or difficult, it costs a fiver generally once you have the tank
That'll depend massively on your guns tank size/muzzle energy, see >>2541523
Then you need to find someone who will fill it obviously.
Incredibly easy to do.
 air bottle for 300-400€.
I don't know where you live but I can get a 3 or 5L dive tank for half that cost which is good for more refills than you could possibly need in one day of shooting.
Quoting shot counts without context is pretty useless. 
I don't tend to say this about airguns but that is a toy, good for plinking but i'd never take one out to shoot anything living.
Good post. One thing though, you can use a pump and a scuba tank interchangeably, if it can be pumped you can use a scuba on it and visa versa.
my priority is accuracy up to maybe around 80 yards (73 meters)
Are there any decent options that can be bought brand new for under $120 USD or so?
I don't have shitloads of air pistol experience but I'd suggest giving up on hoping for accuracy out to 73 meters with them. 
For what you want you actually would be better getting a rimfire pistol. But even then I'd question accuracy out to 73m on your budget.
My father bought gamo when he was getting started. The thing was useless, don't know if it was just a lemon or something but even after being re-barreled it still didn't shoot well.
They were talking about spring guns anon, no one is using 1 piece mounts in the way you're suggesting
The Hawke optics are pretty much all ~fine. 
They're generally nothing fancy at that price point but they'll work well enough.
We have this discussion every thread.
That thing looks grim. Also, you could buy something not hideous for the same cost that will likely shoot better as well.
I just use mine for target practice, my dad made a target out of an old fruit box, packed it full of rubber shavings, and put some sort of cover piece to shoot through. All we have to do is print out a target, tape it up, and we're all good.
They're invasive and their natural predators have been largely pushed out of their habitats. Unlike what liberal retards seem to believe--un checked population increase of any species is awful for the environment and unhealthy for the species as well and almost always leads to disease, food shortages and agressive territory conflicts for that species.
Cause I can.

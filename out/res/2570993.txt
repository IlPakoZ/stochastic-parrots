Onde?
Throughout the week, I'll just walk around my local trails. To the spring to get a drink of water, to a private graveyard on the property, down to the creek to kick my feet around in the water a bit, to the pond to see if any animals are drinking out of it. On the weekend I'll go a bit deeper and set up camp near a pond where 2 creeks merge to form a pond that flows into a river. With camp set up there, I can go even deeper. A cave system that I've always been too afraid to enter, a small waterfall with a small cave behind it, past the waterfall a cave where outlaws stayed for a few weeks while on the run. If I go even deeper I can get to a massive lake, but that just leads back to civilization so I usually don't go that far anyway.

does this giant stack of shiny red rubies real?
I live in a tent on side of mountain in the west bank, my day mainly consists of cooking, praying, listening to the mosque, and walking to the market for supplies
bump
you a jude waiting for a Pali family to get evicted?
Is this the camping thread? Would it be helpful to drop a Tile or Airtag Bluetooth tracker inside a bear cannisters or hanging bear sac? Following the bearmuda triangle, it is suggested to have food 100 metres away from the campsite, so I figure a Bluetooth dongle might help, or maybe they don't work without internet idk. Thoughts?
Out here only Jews get evicted our government is posioned by america and dose what ever the Jew haters in Washington say
LOATHE /out/ with every cell in my body.
Are you the guy who was homeless near Mitzpe Ramon a couple of weeks ago? From the Israel out thread?
Yes I have moved out to yitzhar I tryed to make another Israel thread here but the range ban is in effect
flags on tents are underrated
must admit that thread was extremely successful
nothing generates more heat than >israel
The flag is not on the tent it is on a pole next to it
It was supposed to be a seriouse thread I don't know why goyim have to chimp out all the time
even if it's not like miles and miles remote, if you packed up your tent then pitched it the same place or another place no-one would actually know
Age 11-18 every non winter month a weekend /out/. At least 1 backpack trip or summer camp for a week.
Age 18-23 not much camping, got more into music and playing in bands. 
Age 23-33 camping a little more because start dating(still with the same person). Maybe 2 times a year but not really /out/, just like state parks and stuff. More hiking and hotels in remote areas once in our thirties. 
Age 33-34 got a pass for Whitney and trained a bunch. Long 20 mile day hikes , best shape of my life. Made it to the peak. Wife was pregnant with our first child not not after.
Age 34-38(present) hiking with 2 kids is fun but more planning and prep is involved. KOAs with cabins are good for us. We just got back from our first trip to Zion and got a hotel. I don’t have any gear for overnights but I plan on getting some soon.
Out here only Jews get evicted our government
Based.
what is the /out/ like in those areas, they look quite ancient and populated
A wired mix of urban and rural still pretty comfy I saw at least five dear today just sitting and watching from the side of the hill I live on
Where I live it's full of hills and mountains and villages around them, I would usually start from my town and then navigate the mountains and reach other towns for breaks. I stopped going out after I started seeing shit in the corner of my eyes all the time, it made me anxious as fuck.
My yearly destination trips are much more interesting than my normal weekend hikes or day hikes.
I’ve done a Mt. Hood hike several times, always in the spring or summer.
fly to Portland
light rail to Gresham (suburbs)
bus to Sandy (exurbs, mountain town)
bus to Timberline Lodge/Mt. Hood
If you’re not flying with food, you have to budget more time. And since the transit lines don’t operate 24 hours a day, you have to figure out when you’re landing and where you’ll be staying the first night. You might be able to fly, buy supplies (I don’t think you can fly with stove fuel; I bought mine at Dicks, two blocks from light rail), get to the trail head, then hike, but it would be really pushing it. 
You have to do the same for the return trip. The bus from Timberline to Sandy stops at like 7pm. Plus it’s an hour ride. 
When I did this trip the first two times I stayed at Timberline. It worked out pretty well, as I wasn’t being pressed for time, plus their breakfast buffet is really good. On the last trip I stayed in a Best Western in Sandy that has a Safeway next door. It was much cheaper and honestly more comfy. It’s another hour on a bus to Timberline, but it gave me an hour to enjoy the morning scenery as it passed by the windows, and time to collect myself. On the way back I had time to sort of unwind and relax before doing laundry and eating Taco Bell (also next door).
porra anões, onde posso achar um lugar como esse no interior paulista?
Just hike for an hour into the forest off the trails after work hang up my hammock overlooking a frequented spot and wait for animals to show up during dusk.
On the weekends I go for 30 to 60km day hikes in the hillcountry or alps just to stay in shape for the big summer and autumn tours usually in Scandinavia or elsewhere. Target location varies from year to year.
Occasionally I'll do a bivi overnighter on a mountain or an extended weekend hammocking near a trail (walking the trail) but not very often. Maybe 2 or 3 times a year.
That's about the max you can do if you don't live next to a mountainous nature preserve. I regret having had to move for work.
I go for 30 to 60km day hikes
Holy shit, this guy again!
60 km is only a hair over 1.4 marathons, seems like it's within the realm of possibility (albeit not very plausible).
lol, I also do 100km in one day but only two or three times a year.
age 11-18 camping and dirtbiking at least once a month 
age 18-25(present) have gone camping 2 or 3 times total, life is fucking GAY
ah yes the average speed 5mi/hr speedhiker is back
Not the speedhiker we deserve, but the speedhiker we need
wake up at 6
take a massive shit
leave the hammock
Anon, you're suppose to leave the hammock before you take a shit.
get up at (time of sunrise - 15 minutes - time to travel to trailhead, sometimes this means leaving before 4)
no coffee or food, grab backpack I packed the night before
at trailhead right when there's enough light to hike but before sunrise to avoid people
hike, stop when I'm hungry for a light meal, sometimes just energy gummies
usually back home by mid afternoon or sooner
I haven't backpacked since I was a teen but I'd like to eventually. Don't quite have the money for a tent and such yet (I hike solo only so I take safety very seriously, didn't do any real hikes even on popular trails before I got 10 essentials etc).
I try to not look at the time or worry about pace on my hikes if I can.
Amber Heard goes camping
I care bro, I've been trying more and more to get into fishing but I only ever go by myself because none of my friends wanna do stuff that requires effort

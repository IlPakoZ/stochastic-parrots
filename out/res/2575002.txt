Looking for some new boots, ideally leather and fully waterproof. Anyone got any recommendations that won't fall apart on me? Budget up to £300 ideally but willing to spend more if it's a buy it for life type boot
Thanks
Dont buy goretex boots for the summer months. You are going to have a bad time. Modern boots dont last that long because polyurethane will break down even when you are not using them so dont overpay.
Most important factor is that the boots will fit YOUR feet. So go to a store and try them all.
The poster above me is completely correct, get shit that fits, and the only way to do that is to try them on unless you have weirdly normal sized feet.
Personally I wear Alpina RJ Trappers, though I think they're discontinued. I like a higher boot and something I can tuck my trousers into if I'm in tick territory.
Sorry mate, that's 600 to 800 miles max. You can get that out of any half decent shoe.
Thanks I'll bear that in mind, I'm only in the UK so things don't get too sweaty, even in summer. I've enjoyed the waterproof-ness in the rainy seasons (everything outside of June-September)
My favorite colloquialism is repeating what one believes to be a false statement followed by “my ass”. 
10,000 miles, my ass!
Really? Mines using hyperbole for humour and dramatic effect
goretex 
to explain why. gortex style membranes limits air circulation, so you have worse foot climate. in summer, you can air out and dry your damp boots in 15 minutes. and for crossing rivers or heavy rain gortex or long wet walks it won't help anyway. 
so it's better to go with wet fast + dry fast. vs wet Slow + dry Slow + sweaty foot.
but it's a big matter of expected weather and water/terrain. i use trail runners at the moment. and Lowa zephyrs for mountaineering
If you don't need a waterproof membrane or insulation, just go with hightop sneakers.
As long as there's something grippy between you and the ground, you can manage everything else. 
Stop overthinking life. Whatever you have is better than what the cavemen had...

If you where ever going to inhabit uninhabited places where would you pick, what are places you can survive without government interference, good resources to live, ok climate and such. What places would /out pick
portlock
In Alaska?
ja, that or headless valley, think that's in nw territory
Canada or Alaska would be ok desu, since it's so vastly populated
you mean sparsely populated?
The PNW
No, you can only take three deer a year.
No, you have to enter a state lottery to even get al oicense to get a mountain goat.
No, you can only take 25 Silverbacks a year.
Don't think that you are unregulated because you are in Alaska, chud.
return to /pol/, stay boy
It's true, there are regulations and some are really cutting into your daily life.
I don't think there are places left where anyone can simply live off the land legally.
This makes me so sad
Don't cry anon, in less than 200 years there will be no meaningful life in the oceans, all mammals larger than a rat are dead and insect population has been reduced by 90%. At the same time the shareholder value will go up.
Born to early to roam the galaxy, to late to be truly free.
Somewhere in the Pacific Islands. Micronesia, probably
kek, it's like a 30 min drive from the state capital, I mean it's rural and there's a lot of /out/ out there, but it's pretty much a mix of farmland, low density industrial/commercial with a wide swings of redneck trailer clusters and gentrified estates.
I misunderstood. I thought it was if you could turn an area into an uninhabited place, what would you pick.
Not allowed to just build a shack an live off the land. You have to be owner of the land and native and you have to have a building permit that proves how you deal with fecal matter and so on.
There no truly free places anymore, don't kid yourselves, guys. The dream is over.
That place is St Kilda and I would recognize it everywhere because I've played Dear Esther
autists and sub90 IQs that can't into conditional hypotheticals, need to leave
Saint Kilda island in Scotland? People used to live there now it's all gone
Anyone ever been to Taiga here?
That's St Kilda, there's a MOD submarine base and few land keepers living on it
lol k
I live in the taiga
Wow Anon. You Russian? Do you live in a small town thing? Do you think there will ever be tourism in there?
I am Finnish and i live in a town of 10 000. I do not know if that counts as a small town thing.
Northern Mongolia
yeah, well, i'm gonna need a source for that
Central Idaho
Kek. Go outside.
Every free area has cut grass, it's a cultured landscape.
The whole "without gubberment interference" thing is gonna be impossible, but if you can swing it, any large tropical island is your best bet. The hardest thing about this will be gaining the trust of the locals because if you don't you'll be dead quick.

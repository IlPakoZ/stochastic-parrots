"14er"
trailhead elevation 13875
is intermontane /out/ for real?
Are you referring to North Eolus? Because it's not like you're parking at 13,875 for that. It's 3k feet from the Chicago Basin and 6k feet from Needleton.

trailhead elevation 0
elevation 275
do east coast niggers really?
In 80/80 that's going to be a brutal 275' though.
Who really cares? The only people who walk up mountains are brain dead zombies chasing their first "Rocky Mountain High".
Sorry I don't spend my life on this board like you. Also there aren't 10 threads like this in the catalogue.
Some people really spend all day on this board.
Beautiful pic /east/-chad
Plenty of hikes out west with +5kft elevation gain. How many in the East? Katahdin or Washington maybe? There are hiking routes with more GAIN in elevation in the West than the highest point in the East.
Lots of hikes in the east are multi peak
Picrel is a few examples. Look at those total elevation gains.

Tf is a 14er? Why are liberals so obsessed with flags and gay fucking names for everything? Just go outside and hike
Just go outside
This board can't even make it that far.
greatest gain 7600
spread over 24 miles
you can't make this shit up
Just did Devil's 2 weekends ago, total blast. That one is a deceptive because the descends are such garbage scree and it flattens out the last half
Pick a better 14er
brings up liberals out of nowhere
on an internet forum
why are you so obssessed? go outside

Gonna get lots of lavender this year, what do i do with it? I have some bouquets hanging in my garderobe to make it smell lavender but aside from that what is there to do?
Soap (sell at a steep price to retarded urbanites)
Essential oils (sell at a steep price to retarded urbanites)
Idk anon. What can you do with lavender?
I'd be more interested in having it for myself or giving it away to my friends than making a commercial product out of it. Is making essential oil hard? What do you even do with it? Spray it on yourself to smell lovely?
buy a still and extract the oil.

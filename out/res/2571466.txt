I bought my first boat. 1990 Four Winns 200 Horizon. Working 200HP 2-stroke outboard, though the onboard fuel tank has an issue and won't hold a prime so it's currently running out of a jerry can. $2500 inc. trailer.
(It was offered by a classmate at CDL school. He originally wanted $3500 which would've strained my available funds, so I passed even though it was similar to the 1984 Bayliner Capri we had had as kids and was a load of fun, and I was interested in having something like that again.. A month later he came back with $2800, which roped me back in, but then I still passed on it because I had a lot on my plate with starting a new career. Then he came back at $2600, then $2500, at which point I felt there was almost no way I could lose on it so I just went with it.)
First set of pics are pre-purchase.

End of day 1.
The best days of owning your own motor boat are the day you purchase it and then the day you sell it.
Restoration work soothes my autism, so I'm looking forward to fixing all the things on this that are triggering my autism.
The BMW in the background >>2571475
was a $1000 project that ended up working out.
That's why you inherit the boat and leave it to your kids. Those two outliers you name distort the mean enjoyment of the boat. By excluding them, you get a much clearer picture of how enjoyable owning a boat can be.
looks nice OP good job
Nice work anon.

Stopped reading here. Imagine still thinking private property in 2023
Based, gotta love those ballsy old 2 strokes. 
Oh just shut the hell up, fucking clown
Looks cool. Try to always get ethanol free gas. You prolly already know this but you have to add oil to the gas for a 2 stroke. Mixing ratio should be on the engine somewhere.
How does boating work?
Can I get a boat trailer like pic related and just park up against random ramps I find about the water ways and load and unload cars all willy nilly or do I have to pay fees like a retard
can I operate an unlicensed ferry operation
No idea. It probably doesn't come up much.
You'd need to abide by regulations as to safety equipment, and if you were a nuisance on public waterways you could probably be legislated out of business. But as to whether there are laws specifically regulating the transport of cars or people (such as requiring a bond against anything going wrong), I have no idea.
I never said commercial
People live on boats, makes sense to have a garage
Muh loicense
Gas guzzlers though. Mate of mine had one of these boats but a 180 and it could move it. Cool boat OP you'll have fun caning around in it, don't make a very good fishing boat though
You run into the problem that most cars are BIG compared to the size of boat that most people can afford, and if you have a boat big enough to comfortably hold a car, it's too big to use a boat launch.
Cars and dampness also don't mix.
I don't like to fish. Boring as hell.
Fair enough, you do you. My mates one, someone did some work on it and for some reason the retard put silicone sealant in this hole at the back. One of those ones you can see here iirc >>2571473 That hole as it turns out, is breather for the fuel tank. We took it out and it didn't run so well kek. Took a bit to figure that one out.
It would be funny if that's the issue with your fuel tank as well. If there is any crap in those holes. Maybe crap further up the breather line as well if there is nothing visible. See if it works with the fuel cap off so it can breathe from there
Will do
Fucking Bayliners, floating junk. I guy I knew was jus getting into boating, asked me to help him take it from Fairhaven to Chatham. Boat must have been 20 years old and poorly maintained; inboard powered, slept 4 if you turned the dinette into a double bed. Anyway we left Fairhaven heade across the bay for the pas at Quick's hole through the Elisabeth Is. chain. halfway through the pass the fucking helm station came loose; okay, I took a docking line and lashed it back up to the console and we proceeded into Vineyard sound headed for Chatham; this is in April. Foru mile or so the vessel started to slow down even though the rpm's stayed the same. Open the hatch to the engine compartment and the water jacket had failed an the hull was filling with water. Wat do says the new owner? Turn around and head for Oak Bluffs on the vineyard; barely made it to the dock,.hunt up a mechanic who replaces the cooling jacket. Finally made Chatham at low tide, got stuck in the mud. I burned up the transmission trying to force this POS to the nearest dock, got off and never looked back. I leave thinking what a dumb fuck I am; never again.
Boats are fun for like a month, then the reality of costs and ownership sets in, get out while you can. 
t. Owned 2, now when I get the urge to boat again I just rent one for the day
You want to pull up that hatch on the floor and drill into the stringers to check for rot on a boat that old
reality of costs and ownership sets in, get out
Non-burger who like boats here.
Care to exemplify more?
Thanks, anon.

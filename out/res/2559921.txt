The North Cascades National Park bills itself as the "Alps of America". Do American anons really?
Yes the north cascades are the closest thing to the alps in the lower 48.
I don't know
What characteristics define the original Alps
pretty unanimously the north cascades, most of the 49th parallel ranges are alp-esque from the pacific to montana.
They're way more rugged than the alps and there is way less civilization and they're much more beautiful so the Alps are actually the Cascades of Europe instead of vice versa.
But the real Alps are massive in scale compared to the cascades. Mt. Blanc from Lake Geneva is a sight you would expect to see in the Himalayas, but its in the Alps.
Alaska is several orders of magnitude better than the sun total of euroshit land.
I like the Cascades
Leavenworth is full
no space left in Washington 
kindly fuckoff
the matterhorn
Sure, just as soon as you go back to California.
What makes an Alp an Alp?
Rugged peaks covered in glaciers
Being super steep
sounds like the Tetons to me
Tetons don't have many glaciers left, also a fairly small range.
you have to be 18 to posy here.
So somebody said something? No way.
don't have many
splitting hairs
but they do have glaciers, are stuper steep with rugged peaks. seem to fit the definition pretty well.
The Palisades, and the high peaks in the JMT portion of the PCT.
But the north cascades fit it better
the cascades have a few mountains like that, rainier, baker, and hood are all massive mountains. mt blanc and rainier are 11th and 21st in the entire world for their prominence respectively.
Just live in Wenatchee and mine crypto.
Leavenworth kind of sucks for "living" compared to "visiting" anyway. There are two roads in the entire town that actually go anywhere. One of which is the Chumstick Highway.
this. Mt. Blanc, at 4,000m is more similar in scale to an 8000m peak than a 4,400m peak in the Cascades
*sorry 4800m
Funny how there's no replies from the eurotards on this one
Mountains? Those are volcanos. Volcanos that might erupt in the next 10-10,000 years. For what its worth they are massive and interesting to look at, but the Alps are larger in scale horizontally, the Mt. Blanc massif is wider and built like a wall compared to the conical shape of a volcano.
Very deep valleys (some what true in the cascades), prominent stone massifs and peaks (Not really true in the cascades except 1 or 2 mountains) and a "lush" theme to them with lots of snow on the mountains and a vibrant feel to the greenery. Mostly true for both.
volcanoes 
not mountains
Retard
If you include all of North America as "America" then I would say the Canadian Rockies near Banff, Alberta
How about dem Rockies?
The Canadian Rockies are superior to the Alps. 
If you include all of North America than the Alps are completely mogged by things like the St Elias range and Alaska range.
Don't forget Baffin Island.
What does that even mean?
this 4000m peak is actually more like 8000m
Standard Eurocope
i measured this, and giving mt blanc a very generous measurement it came out to ~40km in a generally NE direction. Mt Rainier is about 25km wide from all directions conically. A 15km difference in a single direction is obviously much bigger, but Rainier is in general a much more massive piece of rock, with similar glaciation and a much more dangerous environment overall due to the volcanism.
Vertical prominence. A 1000 meter peak rising directly from sea level, like say an island, has more vertical prominence than a 500 meter peak that rises from land that is elevated even if the latter peak is higher.
Okanogan is superior But you’ll never move here since rednecks and ndns frighten and confuse you.
Sarcasm, obviously
M8 the cascades are near the coast
St Elias range
Still, most of them are 8K to 9K tall if that. Thats a prominence comparable to the Colorado Front Range, not the Alps. I guess what I'm talking about here is "Jut", the overall vertical reel of the stone face. Here's the mountain with the #1 jut worldwide, Annapurna Fang.
Why do people argue about shit that is objectively calculable? Some peaks have more prominence, some peaks have more glaciation, some peaks have harder ascents. Then subjectively you have different preferences on where to live/visit/talk shit. You guys don’t even go outside if you’re arguing about this
I guess what I'm talking about here is "Jut"
Oh god, please don't tell me the "Jut" spammer from Reddit's mountaineering sub has found his way to /out/
Because human beings like to sort and rank thing. Or maybe I just have autism.
so the Alps are actually the Cascades of Europe instead of vice versa.
you wish
They are within 2 degrees of each other in longitude, so they get pretty much the same sun and are also somewhat close to the ocean.
Honestly I moved to Arizona in 2015 and I don't really see myself living anywhere in Washington again because I don't feel like moving again. But living in Leavenworth was kind of a pain in the ass. Less of a pain in the ass than living in Bellevue but still a pain in the ass.
How's the job market out in Okanogan?
not him but i have family in methow and once the snow starts to melt the farm jobs start popping up and the fruit warehouse jobs open up
mine crypto
kek 
it's so cringey I just can't
live in NJ and will never be a mountaineer
I wish my fucking parents would've moved to colorado. Holy fuck.
That is not colorado?
id kick that silly frog so damn hard
It's overrated. If you've seen one mountainous vista you've seen them all. Backcountry skiing is more worthwhile if you're into type A fun.
I just want to run away from my life and climb mountains every day desu
i was doing that today, nothing gets your heart racing more when a slab is starting to form and you still have a mile downhill to go
Then just do it. Go be a dirtbag.
Live with the parents and save up all of your money for a year or two.
A bit dryer and not nearly as broad, but the Wind River Range gives me similar vibes.
Of course there's that one faggot thinking mountains are a competition.
The Cascades are the Cascades. The Alps are the Alps. Every mountain range has its own individual character and experiences to offer. There is no wrong answer to what your favorite mountain range is as it often comes down to personal experience, your own taste in aesthetics, and familiarity.
Personally, I found the Alps to be gorgeous, but I prefer the rugged wilderness of the Sierra Nevada myself.
nice dubs but there are faggots ITT saying volcanos aren't mountains for the sake of their own argument, anon was just making a simple comparison between two similar slopes.
lol ok fag
Sorry our mountains aren't up to your standards, anon; we'll get to work on making some new ones.
I've lived on both continents and it just depends on what you want to get out of it. I also prefer the wilderness and lack of infrastructure in north america, the Alps are nice to look at and the valleys and mountain towns are very idyllic to me.
the pacific northwest plus alaska is the best hiking in the world hands down
Putting others down is the sport of self-haters.
Canadian Rockies. Sorry bois.
Its not even about peaks. Just about freedom and mastery of the environment.
What do you mean by hiking? American hiking is a far different experience than everywhere else on the world. Smooth clean trails. Pair of running shoes. Its kind of boring desu.
Plenty of bushwhacking to be had, but it gets pretty tiresome over long distances.
Lol wut
Sure, bushwacking sucks when you have to go through willows and so on. 
What I don't like is hiking trails like pic rel. The whole trail looks like this. It looks like a park ranger goes over the trail with a broom and then a spatula to even out the bumps. 
I want terrain that few people walk on, barely visible animal trails, unmarked, pathless, open terrain or forest, pitch your tent anywhere, no ranger strangers.
If I can't get that I'm just going to put on a pair of trailrunners and run the whole thing, and call my mom to pick me up when it gets dark. I like trailrunning too, but it's a different thing. Camping and hiking is just not the real thing when its too civilized or supervised.
Leavenworth is not the North Cascades
just admit that the only places you've been here are near crowded parking lots.
It looks like a park ranger goes over the trail with a broom and then a spatula
hey they have to earn every one of those 20k bucks they make a year
American hiking is a far different experience than everywhere else on the world. Smooth clean trails. Pair of running shoes. Its kind of boring desu.
lol. you either havent been or need to get out more.
he's right tho
you're either him, or you also need to go out more. it's an unfathombly stupid assertion.
about what? about being so fucking autistic that hiking on a well maintained trail causes him to sperg out? I agree with that. But trails like pic related are a tiny minority of trails that i have experienced in the Western US and only the most high profile, well used trails are like that...there are 1000s of miles of all sorts of trails in a wide variety of conditions, terrain and degree of maintenence and suggesting trails like the one in the pic are the norm and not the exception is retarded.
samefag
not an answer or factual. try again.
This is a lie. The Wind River range doesn't exist. Don't try to go visit.
surely only one person would make fun of my retarded post
Did you even read the post to which you replied? A very tiny percentage of wild areas are covered in trails.
American
what part of america have you been to? america is a very big place, maybe you came to the wrong part.
the west coast is actually one of the only places in the world with old growth 'real' forests left.
to have the same experience overseas you have to go to siberia, the amazon rainforest, se asia's jungles, central africa etc. 
that section of trail is going to maintain itself from foot traffic. there's no large trees or anything around it to put organics in the soil, which is what makes it get all fucked up and muddy. some trail is pretty low maintenance especially if there's no equestrian or vehicles on it.
American hiking is a far different experience than everywhere else on the world
fax
come check out the yukon / northwest territories there are not many trails or roads either
most of the injun reserves have no trails
most europoors don't comprehend how massive the USA is or the fact that two states have more forest and mountains than all of europe combined.
Seems like a sight you would expect to see from Geneva.
CLUTCH
CRINGE
I'll posy anywhere I damn well please
I thrive on trite, irrelevant midwittery
indeed
ya still got btfo 
take the L
You seem pretty upset. Do you need a tissue?
boilin?

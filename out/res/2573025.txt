I was collecting rainwater, and I live near a clear stream, which got me thinking. The foundation of human civilization is agriculture, namely grains, allowing us to form sedentary societies. Wheat, rice, corn. The cornerstone of agriculture is water, and clean drinking quality water is critical to life, cooking, hygiene, and survival. If you have water, you can sustain human life, and secure food and everything else necessary to human society. Even before civilization, humans spent most of their existence in tribal societies, where water was still crucial.
We can filter contaminated water, from the surface, from rainwater, or from underground. Clear fresh water from the wilderness can be boiled or treated with iodine in a survival context, but a simple three stage filter can produce purified water. The main components you need to create a survival water filter are gravel, sand, and charcoal. You can get these from the wilderness, and charcoal from burning wood of course in a campfire or charcoal making stove. A small filter can be made with a 2 liter bottle, which works very well, but a bucket filter can purify a large amount of water for storage. Eventually, the filter material will be replaced, so you can make a refillable one or three bucket filter for extremely cheap if you source your own filter material.
The result is clear, pure water directly from nature that can then be boiled or even distilled on a campfire if you'd really like.

I'm talkin about water
stop smoking weed
I'm not smoking weed
Just trying to talk about water filters lmao
Cool story bro.
I don't want sand in my water bro. That won't taste very nice.
yeah it's a pretty good idea
If I lived in the wild somewhere I'd filter the drinking water because pesticides are fucking everywhere
Alex pls go you gonna get banned for ban evasion.
Sand
Where do I find sand, outside of the beach or, you know, the desert?
The drinking water here is of an especially high quality, as the area is full of unpolluted fresh water sources. This is just a means of going off the grid for water for an emergency, to save money, to lessen dependence on the state and corporations. This might sound strange, but I think setting up your own water systems is a very exciting thing.
River and creek beds and banks. Typically a product of water erosion. Got a lot of sand and clay down by the creek, gonna make some charcoal tonight, might post update.
if you ever get lost, follow the water to find civilization
Idk who Alex is you have the wrong guy.
Relevant to outdoor survival and all that.
Creeks and rivers are also a great place to track and hunt the wild game that drinks from it. This works for water drawn from primitive wells as well. You will reach water if you dig deep enough near water sources.
If you can find some chilly well water you won't have to purify it.
I only share this because I know rainwater harvesting is popular among outdoor survivalists and homesteading types. You can actually get higher quality water this way, depending on your local tap water. People collect rainwater in these huge tanks then hook it up to their water system in the USA.
But in Latin America, a lot of people live in improvised housing and depend on roof rainwater tanks to collect and heat water. People just have to make do.
In a survival context, you can dig a simple well or draw surface water for purification in these very thorough filters. You can even boil or distill the purified water to be extra safe if you are really worried about microbes and such. It's also made out of renewable and biodegradable materials that you can gather for $0 and dump without harming the environment.
Mexico city has grown to the point where water demand is far outweighing the lake's capacity so rainwater storage is a necessity for survival for most of the city
I swear this is a perfect solution for communities where water infrastructure is neglected by the government like Flint, Michigan or the Black Belt of Alabama. Better than boiling dirty water or buying cases of water bottles.
Australia has the right idea for the future with their solar powered ocean water desalination plants
another problem that arises is that super industrial cities tend to have acidic rain which needs to be pH treated, not just filtered with charcoal
The Acid Rain Program was a very clever solution when they started responding to acid rain in the 90s, it inspired the concept of carbon credits.
A lot of soil can be sandy or just straight sand under the top soil. Thats what I have, a foot of sandy soil and pure white sand under that for ten feet to the limestone bedrock. Check to see what you're dealing with in your area.
If you have stream, you probably have a high water table. What's your soil type? You might be able to avoid the filter and just put in a drive point well and hand pump. Then the ground filters your water for you.

Seeds of degeneracy! Hunter-gatherers were gigachads and grainfags were sickly. There's genetic evidence of a lot of neolithic hunter-gatherer men taking farmer wives. And it wasn't kidnap/rape marriage either because the hunter chads got integrated into farmer societies.
There's genetic evidence of a lot of neolithic hunter-gatherer men taking farmer wives.
this is the exact opposite of reality
heres the part now where you try to convince yourself pastoralists are hunter gatherers to try and save an argument on an anonymous imageboard

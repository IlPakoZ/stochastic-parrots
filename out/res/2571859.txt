I have no idea where else to ask this but how the fuck do I do yard work? I cant even start my lawnmower (i think i need to clean my carburetor?) and my house needs a lot of landscape work. I can be more specific if youd like. Id love to do it myself but im an autist and dont even know where to learn about this stuff. Is there a good youtube channel for beginners? Please help me /out/ i just want my backyard to stop looking so ghetto
go to /adv/
Ok ill try that
No, go to /diy/, it's a good board
Look up your local community college or maybe even a local high school might offer small engine repair. I learned it in 8th grade but I'm guessing you Yankees were in home economics. Anyway, it might cost you a couple hundred dollars but it will teach you better than a YouTube video.
Just make sure you're priming your lawn mower very well. A few good pushes on the rubbery black button. It squeezes a little gasoline into place for a successful start up. You should probably ask other similarly specific questions here for best results.
I donâ€™t know OP. It looks pretty nice to me.
Oh you sweet sweet thing who just learned what a carburetor is....
Servicing a lawnmower engine is piss fucking easy because they're usually 2stroke like a motorcycle and really anybody can work on them. There could be any number of problems, a dirty carb isn't going to keep it from starting unless it's real, real fucking bad.
Your problem could just be you fucked the engine by not mixing oil with the fuel, or maybe you aren't priming it which is even easier.
Buy an electric mower if you're a casual, they're cheap and simple they just don't work that great for large areas or touch things. I have an electric weed eater and it works okay but it's really fucking slow if I need to do a large area. Takes me 45 minutes to do something that should take 10, but I never have to deal with fuel or priming or working on the motor. I'll just replace it when the electric motor fries.
Besides that anon I suggest investing ~$20 in a nice pair of real leather work gloves, they'll easily last you the year if you don't leave them outside in the elements and they'll last you several years if you actually take care of them, and they'll protect your hands way more than those shitty rubber dipped gloves do. Pull weeds by hand, it gets rid of them better than mowing or cutting anyways since you can take them out at the root.
Lawn mowers are 4 stroke, generally
Probably bad gasoline from not emptying it for winter storage. Replace with fresh gas.
Small engine mechanic here, 9/10 times a quick tune-up will fix your mower. First, let's check the fuel, oil, spark, air.
Fuel: fresh gas present, fuel valve on
Oil: Most are 4-stroke (or electric) by now, so there's a separate reservoir. Correct grade (usually 10w30), amount, and color (gold good, black bad). Too little ruins your machine, too much makes it harder or impossible to start and also run smoky.
Spark plug: Electrodes clean, gap correct, correct numbers on the pulg, ceramic insulator not cracked? A new one is around $6, so many operators simply replace it annually.
Air: Ensure filter isn't clogged with dirt or oil; clean or replace as necessary.
Ensure it starts, then shut it off and tip it sideways, air filter side facing skyward so the oil doesn't drain into it. Inspect your mowing blade/blades for excessive divots or tip abrasion and no cracks or warping. Sharpen or replace as needed and you're all set for another season.
If it still won't start or the engine sounds weird/runs badly once it does, the most likely cause is varnish from the stale gas or some debris is obstructing your carburetor. Quite a few other causes too, so the troubleshooting steps get more complex. Happy to answer further machinery/tool questions too.
As for landscaping, it's hard to truly fuck up.
Consider its current status vs desired state, spend cash or weekends achieving those goals. What specifically do you have in mind?

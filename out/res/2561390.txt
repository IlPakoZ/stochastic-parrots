Do the benefits of nordic walking poles outweight the disadvantages of looking like a fag/senior citizen?
Here's a hiking pro tip: In the woods, there are sticks everywhere. They are literally lying on the ground.
as a 28 year old, with 4 hip joint breaks, shin one tome and ankle, fuck it idunno
whatever gets you /out/ get outdoors
”Nordic walking sticks”
immediate response about free sticks in the woods
tiresome
You must enjoy pulling splinters out of your hands
Do you not wear gloves while /out/ >?
Do you wear gloves between April and November? Because if you do, you'll look like an even bigger dork than anyone using trekking poles.
You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You don’t have a plan (probably the most important). You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.
My car payments are more than your rent
Heh
if you're too concious about nordic walking poles then wait for people to find out you use 4chan
i don't use them (maybe yet) but come on, do you go /out/ constantly thinking
holy shit if someone sees me like this then they will laugh
or do you want to enjoy nature? you go /out/ to literally not give a fuck about people, we all do. so continue, carry on doing what you want as long as you're not littering or burning down the entire forest.
if it's too cold or you are building something then yes, otherwise you can as well use a fucking hazmat suit when /out/, same separation from nature, faggot. if you want to see nature and not touch it then keep on watching tv.
Caring about how you look is pretty dumb anon
Poles taken a significant amount of stress off your knees. This may be insignificant to you now, but in 30 years you will regret not using poles on steep trails.
What kind of fag doesn't pay for his car in full?
Are you poor or something?
disadvantages of looking like a
Are you a 16 year old girl? If not, you shouldn't care.
Let me think now...
looking like a fag or a senior citizen
OR
falling down the mountain
Hmm.
Tough choice.
Pemmican is great food anon. So is rockahominy. There's a reason all outdoorsman utilized it so strongly, white and injun
Honestly I‘ve never even had that thought cross my mind until I saw it here. If people see me im on a trail and im carrying a tent and walking faster than 95% of the other hikers. If they judge me they‘ll probably think im obnoxiously try-harding rather than gay and old.
Nordic? It's muhdic, newfag
Pics are today at 6400'
Poles are useful I like em
I get zero percent financing. You bet I'm always going to take an interest-free loan. I can invest that money and make a nice return and pay off the loan with depreciating dollars
he thinks that its poorfag behavior to take advantage of cheap capital
Lol
I wear gloves because I live in a green hell filled with rash-causing plants and caterpillars
Does wearing shoes outweigh the disadvantage of looking like a fag?
Does using an umbrella in the rain outweigh the disadvantage of looking like a fragile senior?
Who even gets these thoughts? Sounds like insanity/madness.
I love when that copy pasta strikes so close to home that you larping faggots can’t help but feel directly insulted.
Who even gets these thoughts?
The people described in >>2561426
Yes, now stop being a /fa/ggot.
colorado or california?
Why do you care what people think when you're out? Such strange behaviour
he bought the fag sticks
See: >>2561808
I am a fag senior citizen though
they make your ankles weak and actually increase the probability that you'll roll your ankle
The only piece of equipment or gear that has ever increased the likelihood of me rolling an ankle are trailrunners.
are your hands so soft and fragile that simply grasping a piece of wood will shred your palms to pulp?
pod consumer
Pathetic
Anyone can get deep splinters and possible complications from them. Imagine dealing with this shit because you were afraid that someone might think you're a fag
https://www.livescience.com/65710-should-you-always-remove-splinters.html
nothing makes your ankles weak permanently like repeatedly rolling them with full body weight+ like you would without walking poles. 
Just do strengthening exercises and protect yourself with the poles and you'll be good
Carry a rifle like a man.
You should probably just stay indoors where it's safe
No they don't.
Do you really believe this anon
your only two options are using a stick from the ground or staying home
I had it happen just a few weeks ago so yes
It doesn't matter about the copypasta, it's about the message
If you're scared of splinters from every random stick, then yes, you should stay home.
Up in WA actually.
I do like feeling unencumbered for parts of some hikes, but using them especially when the terrain is more difficult just massively increases my endurance. Plus having 3 points of contact at all times on more treacherous sections of trail is enormously helpful. Who are you trying to look cool for in the woods anyways?
Idk just don't pick up a splintery stick it's not that hard
Get fucked you authoritarian freak who insists that everyone else must do things his way or not at all. You're exactly the type of person I go /out/ to get away from. 
Or just buy a better one and have it for life. It's not that expensive.
Bought some for helping me get through some ankle issues. Got through the issues with them and I'd never go back. Crossing rivers is way better, checking that you're about to stand on solid ground is awesome when you're in terrain that can have all sorts of holes and crumbly soft stuff. Pointing at stuff with your poles is awesome. Slippery ground, going down hill, going up hill. I use them help prop up my tarp when I make camp. The benefits go on and on and on, why the hell do we walk on two legs its shit. 
Only downside is carrying a rifle with them isn't all that great.
Yes. For some people they mught not outweigh the drawbacks, but this isn't a situation where form should rival function
If you look like a fag with poles, then losing the poles isn't going to help you. 
Stay in the Bay, faggets
Ive just vicariously saved all your images. Curious as to where this is
Northern end of the Crystal Range in the Eldorado Natl forest.
Do the benefits of nordic walking poles outweight the disadvantages of looking like a fag/senior citizen?
only if you're using a trekking pole design tent.
if you think about it, its just a multi functional tent pole and free weight.
pro
there are sticks everywhere
anon are you retarded?
there are entire biomes without a single tree.
there is no excuse other than poorfaggotry or laziness to not either buy a good stick (which comes with a lot of upsides like lighter weight and collapsibility so you can climb with them) or at least select a good stick out in the woods, bring it home, give it some finishing and keep it.
in what retard's world does it make sense to spend a half hour finding a decent stick every time i go hiking? why would i not just buy a stick at that point? i go hiking all the time. that adds up to a lot of wasted time i could be on the trail. sticks also don't exist in half of my state.
So what's the point of walking poles at all other than for checking snow depth? Genuinely curious, I find them to be a hinderance in rough terrain and in particular thick bush. Maybe I'm just using them incorrectly and have yet to see the light.
They're good for balance and stability when crossing streams and descending slopes down to waterfall bases. They take pressure off your knees on steep descents and are also useful on inclines. They help you look out for rattlers when you're hiking through grassy or bushy areas. And some people use them as poles for makeshift, lightweight shelters.
Poles are poles. Use them when overloaded to save your back. 
Staves are for the poor. They're much more versatile.
I went traipsing around uninhabited private land once. So hilly I had to cut a sapling for a staff to get back out. 
Still have the staff.
Hiking pole tents have turned poles into net 0 downside gear addition.
You can even have a base setup. Using a single pole tent at camp, and taking the spare for walkabouts.
I make bad financial decisions
this one's the funniest to me
or you could purchase a car you can afford, which you did not because you had to borrow the money on a depreciating asset
you are not a financially smart person, you're someone who couldn't afford to purchase a car
he thinks having to borrow money means he's good with money
good goy
you shouldn't be outside without a bush axe anyway.
imagine being so frail that walking in the woods is dangerous. Sad!
what sort of retardation is this?
children learn to avoid stupid shit like that before they are teens.
Why do you ameriniggers call these Nordic? I have never once seen anyone use walking poles here in Norway
I don't know. I think there's a separate activity that's like power walking with some kind of pole that it refers to but I've only ever seen them called trekking poles.
No one uses the term “Nordic walking stick” in the US. We call them trekking poles. It’s either a newfag calling them Nordic or something they say in Australia.
Nta but building credit is absolutely necessary to be successful in the US and because banks suck ass the more debt you have that’s consistently paid means more money can be borrowed. Borrowing money to buy shit is a great financial move when you already have the money for it anyway.

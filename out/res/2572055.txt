How do you carry small amounts of food and water when out on a smaller hike when traveling? E.g. you have an 80l backpack with all your gear, but don't wanna bring it on a 12 mile hike. Belt? Detatchable daypack? Something else?
In my humps.
Post bobs
I have a tiny backpack I use for this stuff, or I'll just wear a hoodie and use the front pocket if the trip is short enough.
get a 20l bag
Society would be so much better off if women could store water in their breasts.
just drink the milk
Search "summit pack". I have the older style REI flash 22 which I can stuff into my large pack or wear on my chest, backwards, for getting through airports or whatever.
I live innadesert so I'm bringing like 8L of water for that.
This
All men and women store perfectly usable water in a bladder. DRINK THE PISS.
Depends what's a small amount to you.
For me, it's the Helikon-Tex Essential Kitbag.
But it's really small. Holds a Nalgene, and maybe like 10 Snickers bars.
They make bigger ones though.
I really like Helikon-Tex. Just a great company.
And it has MOLLE on the back, so if you take your backpack, you can use it to expand your backpack by a few liters.
You get an ultralight packable daypack sold by any number of companies. Decathlon used to sell some dirt cheap ones. More high end alternatives are available from a company like Sea to Summit. You can also purchased ultralight fanny packs.

https://www.decathlon.com/products/hiking-ultra-compact-fanny-pack (good value for money)
You can even buy much larger backpacks designed to be very light and compact. Pic related is one I purchased from the Chinks. It's a 40l backpack that packs down to about 4-5l

Yeah this.
Just have a smaller bag. 80 liters have detachables but they're usually really small.
12L or 24L (5.11 Rush 12/24). Twelve miles sounds like a lot for just carrying a fanny pack
I just bought a ripoff in aliexpress
the decathlon ones are literal trashbags with straps
when i go fully grey men
they can't?!
my life is a lie.
Well, it's a trashbag which has lasted me 5+ years and several dozen day hikes.
I like Helikon too, I have like 4 coats
i have this small fanny pack with a bottle holder for small hikes. it feels like im not carrying anything at all.
Fanny pack or externally straped dedicated hydration bladder pack, tuck it under thw top flap of ur back pack
I keep everything I need on an old western style bandolier.
Camelback is 2L. Golden rule is that if you have empty space you're probably gonna fill it so pick smaller bags.
Hills People Gear Recon. Can attach binos, rangefinder, knife, or whatever on the outside. Conceal carry my firearm in the back pocket and hold snacks, extra ammo, headlamp, hydration packets, etc in the front pocket. If you're going on a small hike then just carry the bottle.
something like this, shits so cheap it's even disposable
city park perv
i dayhike a lot up north where there's weather and stuff and you sometimes need gear here's what i use:
lumbar pack
running vest
camelback thing with 5l pocket
15-30l daypack (any) when i need rain gear and shit
all you actually need is one of the first 3 and a daypack at most, i've just collected and tried out various shit over the years those are the keepers for me.
im not a fan of those packable ultralight bags, the straps are horrible. i see the appeal but im in a tshirt
90% of the time and they dig in after 6 hours of hiking
Right

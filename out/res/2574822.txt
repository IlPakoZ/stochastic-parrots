I recently got a Jeep Liberty and I want to use it for camping and road trips.
I was thinking of getting a car tent plus a mattress for the back seat area. 
Does anyone here have experience with this sort of setup and what would you recommend?
I value sc/out/ opinions more than amazon reviews and top 10 sites so any help is appreciated. 
I'm strapped for cash right now so I'd prefer stuff on the cheaper side but not so cheap it'll break after the second use.
The car is already your shelter. Don't buy meme shit. 
Try different ways of sleeping in your car out front your house. Figure out what works for you before committing. Being supported physically and being able to lay flat with no bent joints is ideal. But I did sleep in the back of a 2011 1500, extended cab. And my knees were constantly bent all night long- and it worked cause I had no other choice- but I'd much rather had laid flat.
I recently bought a rav4 for similar purposes, what I would recommend is going and sleeping in your jeep with just blankets and a pillow etc and see what is uncomfortable in your setup. Build up slowly and improve your setup organically rather than plunging deep and buying potentially unnecessary stuff, you'll learn a lot about your car too.
Some issues I found and resolved so far, if it's of any interest:
I realised after putting my back seats down there was an uncomfortable gap in between the boot area and where the seats folded, so I chucked some cheap cushions I had in that gap to fix that issue.
The floor of the back of the car, even though its carpety material, was too hard for my liking even with a duvet underneath me, so I've put an old futon mattress in there as it folds easily.
You'll figure out things like this once you take it camping once or twice. If it won't work at all you will find out pretty immediately.
i've done car camping before so its not something new to me really. but the gear im familiar with was stolen a couple years ago and it was all more than a decade old (inherited from my grandmother) 
What i'm really looking for is tips on what to avoid/look for in the new market.
Specifically for the tent I'd want something enclosed so bugs are mostly kept out unlike OP pic.
futon mattress
didn't think about that, i like this idea a lot. should probably mention it won't be just for solo use but also with my girlfriend
I'm also mainly car camping with the gf, and the futon was her idea. We went for a double that's slightly oversized rather than a single that's undersized, as it'll completely fill the back of the car and fold at the sides rather than not being big enough.
In terms of tents, you have the luxury of not caring about weight or volume, so you could get a simple 4 man dome tent or something maybe? Most of the ones marketed towards car camping seem overpriced, I'd love a roof tent but they're hilariously expensive.
Liberty is way too small. You can fit laying at an angle but he is with his girlfriend.
Just get a separate tent. Don't get one of those tailgate tents or one of those god forsaken rooftop tents
Best solution.
I drove across country and just thought I would just sleep in my car. If I were you I would also get a tent because some of the places mosquitoes were bad and getting in the car.
Holy based
What the fuck that's awesome
I don't really see the value in having your car be part of your tent. Why not just use a normal tent and set it up next to your car?
Also sleeping in cars sucks, if you don't need to carry it you can just get a big heavy inexpensive family tent with plenty of room, half the point of vehicles is carrying heavy shit for you, you don't need pricey backpacking gear if you're camping in drive in spots anyway.
No idea what specific models are good. Walmart sells that kind of thing really cheap but suspect quality, Aliexpress has them even cheaper and more suspect. Always bring some spare tarps and duct tape anyway.
When it's cold outside you don't want to be sleeping outside if there is an indoor option like your car. I personally would rather sleep in a tent/hammock over a car, but there are nights where I wish I had somewhere warm to sleep
How do you transport it? It doesn't look like it folds up.
NTK makes good car camping tents. Mine survived a hailstorm on its first use and many family trips since.
futon mattress
mattress in general
you can also look for 'trucker mattresses'. they are made for the bunk inside a semi-truck / lorry. I don't know if it would fit in your car but you can check websites for dimensions and grab a tape measure and size it up
It attaches to the back of your car, what do you mean?
Those are generally made of foam and not too comfortable in my experience
There are ones that do, but they're more expensive than the non-foldable versions.
How are bugs getting in? If you want your windows open you can easily stick netting or screen material between the door and the frame, I kind of shoved the bottom edge into the window slot too, magnets help also. Worked for me even in infested areas.
Neat, but yknow hammock stands are already a thing. They're portable and they snap together pretty quickly. At the moment I can't think of any advantage to the hitch mounted design.
ITT: people who think “car camping” means sleeping in your car.
wtf is the point of attaching a tent to your car?
this is so fucking retarded
You can use the exhaust to heat the interior of the tent
jeepfag
Buddy, that car will never leave the pavement and you know it.
First of all in hindsight, like >>2574856 I'm a retard and didn't realize my Liberty is too small to lay down flat. Maybe in the future I'll make an expanding platform. 
But to answer your question the value of having a tent attached to the car is easier access to your gear/storage from where you sleep.
And that can be a vice versa situation. If you sleep in the SUV/van then you can put all your storage and gear in the tent. If you sleep in the tent you can leave all your shit in the car and everything is equally accessible.
Really it's just preference. 
but that's exactly what my question is about retard-kun
I go on gravel sometimes :^)
no its not and you sound really stupid saying this. just try to think of benefits from doing it so vs downsides and see for yourself.
but that's exactly what my question is about
You don’t know what car camping is and you should feel bad. You won’t, because /out/ is very ill informed and infested with newfags.
ok then anon what do you call camping when you sleep in the car
I don't really see the point of carrying extra tents etc if you're already travelling in your car, you can bring exactly the same shit, just less, and sleep in your car, or better still, bring even comfier stuff and sleep in your car. No damp tent to worry about, way more protected from the elements and animals, it just makes more sense. Unless of course you're just camping at a campsite for the fun of camping, then the car is irrelevant and your whole argument falls flat.
I think a lot of it had to do with me driving with the window cracked to stay awake.
weight/size of gear is less of an issue when car camping, car size is an issue. with a small car its better to have cooler and cocking gear setup for quick roadside snacks, same for camera, fishing rods or whatever else you like to do through the day while traveling.
when you finally stop for the evening you leave all that in your car and pull out a tent to sleep in.
if you put some effort into it and have a large enough car then yeah you can sleep inside it next to your gear.
You guys have to ask what a universally understood term is because you’re newfags. As such, you should stop trying to redefine that term just because you don’t understand it. Ask questions without interjecting your retard opinion.
Ah I see now, whenever I've gone on road trips I've always slept in my truck because its big enough, my bad.
there are no sensible practical benefits
its a retarded meme
EZ-Up canopy, some line and stakes to keep it from becoming a parasail, and maybe a tarp or two for privacy or rain protection.
Liberty is not long enough to sleep in. I have an Outback that’s substantially longer in the bed and seats fold perfectly flat and I still have to put my head over the center console with pillows. It can be comfy but honestly it’s a pain in the ass unless you take next to nothing with you. Because you have to move your shit around.
If you’re taking shit with you just get one of those cheap 2 man hiking tents that are easy to setup. 
Also check if Liberty seats actually fold flat and where you have to pay to be fully stretched out.
Meme. It will not be cold when you have a car. Because you don’t have to lightweight hike you do not need to compromise on a narrow pad etc. You have a car next to your tent, you can bring shit with you. Even a mattress, I’ve laid on an air mattress once that was extremely comfortable so you don’t need to lug an indoor mattress. You can still use a sleeping pad if you want but get an extra wide extra thick one.
Let’s say you have 2 people. You now have to empty the bed and all move all your stuff to the two front seats and the rear two seats foot well and put the rest outside under the car or on the tray/racks of you have one. It’s a pain in the ass. On your own? You can have shit on either side of you on the bed but it feels cramped, and you still need your head over the center console with a pillow unless you’re a manlet or a woman. Packing and unpacking like this for every sleep fucking sucks and your gets jumbled and disorganised to fuck. 
It only works if you only take stuff that fits in the front passenger seat and that’s, so you can leave bed setup and not pack/unpack and jumble shit. With a tent in the right spot of the car just pull the kit out, set it up, throw in mattress/pad etc. it’s less work.
what is rain
i've done car camping before
the tent
what the fuck are you talking about
Have you really never used a tent in the rain?
i would like to ask you the same?
That’s not a question you mong. 
The presence of rain doesn’t negate the utility of a tent. What kind of fucking newb retardation is this? Tents are waterproof. Why in the holy hell would it matter if it’s raining?
Tents are waterproof.
you'd be surprised, if you'd ever went outside before
tents aren’t waterproof
lol
LMAO
you're trying too hard kid
since its clear you have never used any of them for car camping in bad weather let me break it down to you in simple terms
tents are water proof and provide shelter and shade
same for a car
the open area between them doesnt....
smart people manage to think in terms of problem solving figure out ways how this area can be reduced to a minimum and also made waterproof
its no different from bringing a tarp if you sleep in a ground tent while hiking, you make the tarp cover both your tent and the outside area so you dont get that nasty runoff that by some dark magic always dump a bucket of rainwater in your neck.
you cannot understand why tents connected to the car is a thing i cannot undestand why they should be disconnected? there is no benefits to it in a car camping situation.

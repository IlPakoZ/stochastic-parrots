I made a knife handle out of a piece of this random log that was in a chop pile. It turned out pretty well and I want to find more but have no idea what species it is.
Can anyone here tell what species of tree this came from?
Are the branch holes symmetrical or alternating on the logs?
aspen?
Going with maple like they told you already on /diy/. Like that one Anon said, lick it and see.
I thought that was some Anon trolling, didn't think it was you! Ha! Well I'm guessing too, I grew up in North Central Kentucky, and am in southern Ohio now, and it looks like maple to me, but yeah it could be something else. It even looks like it could have some figure in it (tiger striping, curl, call it what you will). I've worked it a decent amount, it has a smell that you'll remember, kind of sweet, so the taste it guy wasn't completely being an asshole. Well, yeah he probably was, but it's whatever.
Tl;dr Could be a few things, but if you like it, use it; and if you can find some nice curly sugar maple grab it and it'll make great knife handles. Good luck.
Lmao, I was hoping it'd make you laugh. Yea I'm still thinking silver maple and the taste thing actually makes sense now I didn't really consider it, when I get home I am gonna lick it, lmao. Thanks for help man.

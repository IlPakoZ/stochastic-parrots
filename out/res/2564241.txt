I always bring a few cans with me but I'm considering packing a half rack from now on. I'll bet you pussies don't even drink beer.
I bring moonshine which I refine myself from cheap wine. It's 68%. Instead of carrying 1l of beer I can just carry 200ml of my moonshine.
You should at least consider taking spirits. Fuck carrying half a gallon of beer that's only 4% or something lmao.
Right on. Here's my thinking:
Cans of beer add a bunch of weight on the first day of a hike but like magic your pack weighs two pounds less on the second day. If I can't carry a couple extra pounds the first day I'm in bad shape. 
Beer is hydrating. If the first night is a dry camp you'd have to bring water anyway, so might as well bring beer. 
Beer has calories. Instead of eating a sugary snack, drink beer. 
Beer requires no mixer. Yes I know spirits technically don't require a mixer but even good bourbon likes a splash of spring water. 
I have a question for you. When you distill wine, what percentage is heads and tails? I've done a few runs of corn liquor and had enough trouble that I'd like to do a wine distill.
I prefer spirits. Usually pre-mixed into a cocktail of some kind at home and carried in a thermos. Beer is too little alcohol for the weight imo.
I'll sometimes bring a beer or two on a day hike, or a few if we're car camping though.
i just go to the gym
Beer is hydrating.
Lol
Lmao
fun fact: 1/2 kegs fit perfectly inside the late 90s type US military rucksack.
At least a 12 pack, any less and you’re just jerking off. What’s your beer of choice more importantly ? I’m a pbr man myself
Any good IPA. I had a rye beer years ago that was nice but I've never found another. A cold beer after a long hike is what I live for.
both shit tastes
Okay you guys are faggots and beer/whiskey hangovers suck so here is my recipe for good booze to be /out/ with.
1l spirit 95%
2l vodka 40%
1kg plums (without the seeds)
0,5kg sugar (or more, depends on the taste, can be replaced with honey)
Mix that shit and let it stay in a big jar for a month. Shake it every other day. After a month it's ready but remember that it only gets better with time. We don't want seeds due to cyanide that may appear after some time. Cheap, tastes heavenly and almost no hangover after that. Ration it according to your needs. It's an old Polish recipe.
Id kill you if i could
i dont drink at all. everyone who drinks gets fat and ugly, its a cruel reflection of their uninhibited personality that cannot say no to poisoning itself.
You're looking to us to to tell you how much you're allowed to drink and calling other people pussies in the same post? Really dude?
You must go back.
7 months sober
you too can be free
I don't drink alcohol.
Congrats brother, I got 3 years 2 months
Don't drink a ton of beer but victory is probably my favorite
Try having sex; you won't get so angry about such trivial things.
Well I'm not a retard who can't into self control so I'll keep enjoying beer in moderation. Congrats for recognizing you had a problem and dealing with it though.
Based. I went from drinking 3 - 4 24 packs per week with a bottle of whiskey all through my early 20's to quitting cold turkey. Almost 30 now, and I can enjoy a social beer or two without desiring to get shit faced. Haven't had a buzz on in years and I dont even miss it. I look back on those years in disgust and shame
Im an alcoholic and i prefer not to bring beer when out, ruins the experience and my fishing, despite the fact that i can drink ireland under the table. I only drink during the evening
Lol fair enough anon and ty
Nice
kek
Nigger I drink bourbon like water.
ask me how I know you're a fat female
Carry liquor or something high alcohol
Yeah is does suck because sometimes you need mixers, but you dont need to get the highest proof stuff out there, some crown flavors can be sipped straight with very little bad taste at all
The last time I drank while camping, I had such a good ficking time that I blacked out and pissed in my tent
What be your taste anon, bud light ?
drinks beer, which lowers testosterone and makes you fat
A good Wodka is perfect, high alcohol content, wont freeze, tastes good when unmixed, but can also be used in combination with almost anything.
Also only beer that has been brewed in Czechia, Poland, Slovakia, eastern parts of Germany is accepteble, everything else is sugary pisswater.
totally not a retard though

you are retardet
why are americans afraid of high proof alcohol? Can't you just bring something that has more than fuckinf 5% pussy? What, your throat will burn after a sip of 98% spirit? Pussy
I take stronger stuff like scotch or jaeger, in a plastic bottle to save weight. No litter as it can be filled with water later.
Wake up modern man.
Can moonshine be used to disinfect water in a pinch? What's the ratio of alcohol to water needed to prevent waterborne illness?
I'm sure somebody figured that out but in the grand scheme of things it's not something you should rely upon because there are so many other ways to treat water. Save your liver for good beer, bourbon, tequila, etc.
Your woman is having sex and you are not.
Not really. You need more than 10% ethanol to have any significant antiseptic effect (and even then it's pretty minimal). At that point the alcohol is going to dehydrate you more than the water can offset.
The 5-liter Heineken Draft Keg is the perfect size for a day-hike.
Anything over 2 drinks per night is over the limit.
Yeah but it's Heineken.
While you're correct about the nightly limit you didn't quite answer the question. I posit that three beers is insufficient for a typical pack trip, but if you were on a seven day pack trip, even two beers per night would mean carrying a 12-pack (the seventh night usually being spent at home). If the pack trip was a simple three mile hike to a camp where you'll be staying until you return home, this is doable. Otherwise, one might be forced to stage loads of beer or use porters for a lengthy trip, mountaineering style.
right
Some decent cans of belgian 12% triple is always nice.
you just haven't tried good beers from other regions then
Between my brother and I we typically have a full case of Leinenkugels Original day 1, and by day 3, it’s just a couple oz of aluminum in the trash sack and it’s whisky time. I like Redbreast Irish whisky, and we bring it in a couple of Stanley flasks
I don’t tend to drink when I’m hiking without him. I think it’s because when I hiking without him, I generally can’t depend on other people to drink and carry their own weight or drink and not become a mess in camp.
Not being able to understand bringing alcohol on a hike is pissbaby tier, not being able to hike without drinking is dependent little bitch tier.
How many times were you dropped on your head as a child?
NGMI
A splash of spring water is a mixer? Run along now son, your momma's calling you.
Ask me how I know you'll die a virgin
Tits or GTFO
*blocks your path*
What?
I used to hide kegs in the forest. I would leave a guard in the area just in case someone else came along... The third time I did this the guard got so drunk he fell out of a tree after 9 hours of day drinking waiting for everyone to show up... so I had to stop.
Everclear. Not just for breakfast, lunch, and dinner anymore.
Alcohol is a diuretic, doesn't matter what beer or drink it is in...
I'm sober it if I weren't I'd take mead.
The only beer you ever need
Why bother with separate everclear and vodka? You might as well just dilute the everclear with water to whatever proof you want 
Also plum liquor would make me shit endlessly
I'm finishing up a can just like that at this very moment. At &lt; $1/beer, Yuengling's 24 packs are a great value
You realize we've been drinking beer for thousands and thousands of years, right?
I hid them before parties and before I was 21. My buyer could only get them certain days so I would hide them usually the day before because I didn't have anywhere else to keep them.
I avoided that stuff for the longest time thinking it was some weird Chinese shit beer.
It’s actually really good and not even Chinese. What a world.
That would be Ying Ling rice beer. Common mixup.
Its good beer if you enjoy peeing and want to drink a six pack just to get buzzed.
Every town in the PNW has atleast one brewery. Forks, population of 3k has one. Port Townsend, Coupeville... FFS even Twisp has one.
LOATHE beer with every cell in my body.
Based. I usually bring a flask of whiskey with me and sometimes a single 12oz to-go of wine you can find at a liqour store.
Not a big wine drinker, but it hits really well when I cook up some camping pasta for dinner. Makes it feel more like a complete meal. 
Otherwise yeah, usually a flask and then a 24oz beer for chilling by the fire. Even better if it's hot out and you find a cold stream to chill the beer in while you're out hiking. Coming back for a cold beer in 90+ degree heat is amazing.
You're right, I bring 2 flasks of whiskey and a pack of reds.
Just recently walked 800 miles with my buddy who’s a drinker. Every town was a 12 rack of 7% ABV craft beer. He’d drink them all that day, usually getting in at least 24 every town. He can be drunk and still maintain a 3.5mph pace. But it just gets ridiculous when you start doing dumb shit because you’re drunk. Running through water crossings, getting blisters, getting lost, losing your things. Plus you’re hungover the next day. I like to drink beer at the end of a trip or end of a day, feels better and doesn’t interfere with my plans
I carry a pint of bourbon. The gut rot the next morning is usually rough if I drink the whole thing too fast.
fuck you motherfucker im gonna fucking kill you
the answer is never enough
we have stopped our hiking trip 3 times and rerouted towards the nearest store that sells liquour just because we did not bring enough
after a full day of completely wasted hiking going to the wrong way beer does taste pretty good
Alcoholism. Quit before it inevitably gets worse. Name one long term benefit of drinking alcohol.
It enables me to tolerate Dunning Krugers like you.
Beer is estrogenic, makes you drowsy, gives you a headache, dehydrates you, and lowers your IQ. Why would anyone ever drink it? Beer consumption and masculinity are direct opposites; the least masculine cultures consume the most and the most masculine cultures consume the least. Beer is nothing but pure, useless, worthless poison that no one would ever consume if the better stuff wasn't illegal.
Nothing wrong with a few brews

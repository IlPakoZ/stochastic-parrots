Is sleeping in a hammock bad for your back? Or your health in any way? Am thinking of getting a tttm hammock, but I'm 6'5 and don't know if it'll work for a tall guy like me.
People actually sleep in hammocks to help relieve their back pain, as long as it's long enough I don't see why you couldn't use one. They are pretty comfortable and easy to use.
Horrid for your spine
People actually sleep in hammocks to help relieve their back pain
The same people probably visit a chiropractor every two weeks to get fed snake oil
Nah pretty comfy. Lots of old people use them for that reason. At your height you may be a candidate for a full 12ft gathered end, although probably still ok with the normal 11ft.
I’ve met several older people with back and hip issues that have switched to hammocks because they couldn’t handle sleeping in the ground anymore. Their options were a hammock or wake up in pain. 
It’s the hammocks length rather than its width that determines its size. As a man of only average height (6’ 1”) anything smaller than 11’ is just too small. I have an Eno Doublenest that I found really cheap, and it’s great for lounging around but if I stretch out to sleep my feet hang off the end. It’s 9’ 8”. My Dutchware hammocks are 11’, which is pretty standard for camping hammocks, and it’s perfect. You might want to look for a 12’, which most cottage vendors can easily do. Tbdesu if you know someone with a sewing machine it’s really easy to make your own. Cheap too.
I love hammock sleeping as a side sleeper
yes its bad long term. you want to sleep with a straight spine. but its ok for a few nights.
people who are already sick and fat.
It's okay if you are doing it right.
No-one actually gets a good nights sleep in a hammock btw. They are a meme.
How exactly do you side sleep in your hammock? Say if you are head left, feet right, do you lay on your right or left side?
I just had my first nap in my hammock and I feel great! I really enjoyed being off the prickly ground.
There are a few legitimate reasons to not use a hammock
being an idiot and can’t figure it out
meh, just not appealing; no thanks
I count every gram and it’s just not worth it
camping in a place with no trees (duh)
But this
is straight up retard-tier. Just dumb, and probably the same person.
Which one?
Their travel hammock?
What weird sizes for that they have…
Goes from 10’4”, which will be too small for you, to 16’4” which I’ve never actually seen.
You should find a 12’ hammock.
Meds schizo. Humans are not supposed to sleep in the shape of a banana, simple as. A hammock made my back pain twice as worse on trail. Screwed my shoulder up also trying to side sleep. Literally fucking pointless. You're not in avatar bro, quit the larp
Not that anon but being a side sleeper I'd don't lie truly on my side, but the cradling of the hammock allows me to get that feel.
Hey man I'm sorry a hammock killed your pops or whatever.
Post a screen shot proving your not same fagging
hammock bad
it raped my father and killed my wife’s boyfriend
it had me bent up like a banana
You’ve never laid down in a hammock.
These retards have probably never slept in a hammock and think you are supposed to lie longitudinally, so have made the otherwise reasonable assumption based off that that it shapes your spine into a banana. 
I actually started typing this before reaching the bottom of the thread, so hadn't seen >>2574888. Did I not fucking call it? FUCK you dumb fucking cunt!!!! OP if you don't believe me then get yourself a cheap hammock, as long as its the right length it doesnt really need to be able to handle the elements. hang it up in your yard and lie across it like >>2574850. you might have to shuffle around a bit before you feel it but once you are there you will know right away.
It’s the same person. She pops into every hammock thread to mention being shaped like a banana, scoliosis, or chiropractors.
I slept in a hammock for a year with this Tensa4 stand in my apartment before I decided to start sleeping on the couch, and even then I'd still sleep in the hammock sometimes. My back is in great condition. You wanna know what is horrid for your spine? Not stretching, engaging back muscles, or being mindful of your posture.
All you need is the right angle, the right insulation, and the right mindset to be ok having a bit of a learning curve with your sleeping system. 
When I'm backpacking I love sleeping in my hammock; I get the best sleep, and the comfiest mornings ever.
Fake news from BIG HAMMOCK you will not get my money sir
Tensa seems neat but also a PITA for setup. For motocamping, it must take like 45mins to an hour to set it all up in the field, no?
ITT: banana fags having mental breakdowns 
I think the scoliosis is affecting your nervous system bro. You should get that checked out and maybe sleep on the ground for a change
It absolutely is a pain desu. It's a really nifty setup, and if you're under 6ft I think it'd be great. I am 6'2" and it took a LOT of finicking with to get it really perfect for me.
They are neat, and in fact the main reason I picked them up was just for motocamping when I was looking into it a lot, plus a solution for desert camps where I didn't have walls to lock my climbing nuts in for suspension points. 
the bag is pretty heavy even though the poles are Ti, and another problem I found was that my poles actually got stuck together after daily use for so long, and now they are seemingly permanently stuck in that position, so no breaking down all the way for me.
I was researching them for consideration but everyone only talked about the pros and not the cons. It is nice to get some unbiased feedback. I'll probably just hit the ground with an air mattress and one tieout to a tree if I can't find a good hammock placement
this board sucks
i've got a hammock at home for when i feel like watching birds outside. sleeping diagonally, it's obviously not as comfy as a bed and you can tell that the quality of sleep is worse on average, but i'd imagine that if you're outside, it's a pretty good alternative.
Quality post. Thanks for contributing.
imagine dedicating your life to being anti hammock? who are you? touch grass...
i sleep like a fuckin baby in my hammock...just make sure to wear a cap you can pull over your eyes so the sun doesn't wake you up to early. and don't be too scared of animals trying to snack on your exposed body or cuddle up with you, it's never happened to me.
I'm going to try using my buff to cover my eyes when sleeping. Multifunctions ftw
I just got one, I'm 6'4" and I got a bridge hammock and its very cozy in my driveway. Going to take it camping this weekend.
Am I crazy for thinking about buying picrel and using it as a bed indoors for 6+ months?
I have a hammock for /out/ and I've used it for overnight to 2 week long trips, but I need to move out of state for a temp work contract. Hammock and stand combined are $47 with free shipping, Seems like the cheapest option is to get an apartment and buy a hammock, instant pot and TV and bring 1-2 bags with me for clothes / computer / etc. 
Anyone lived in a hammock for that long before?
You're still going to sag worse than on an American boxspring bed. Hammock can never be as good for your back as a proper mattress.
For reference I make my own hammocks, any length, from 12.5' to 9'. Depending on what I want and use them almost exclusively in the forest.
However on trips longer than a week I am glad I get to touch grass while falling asleep.
Probably a bad idea. These cheaper hammocks are generally very short (under 10’). If that’s what you take camping and know it works for you then go for it. If you’re using an 11’ hammock for camping it won’t fit in this stand.
likewise faggot
Everyone on Gilligan's Island.
Sailors slept in hammocks for years
That's fine if you plan to die of scorbut at 55.
With 6'5" you need a very long and wide hammock, they are rare and pricey, regular expected size of the customer seems to be below 6'.
Then you need a bottom quilt and a blanked or top quilt. Then you need the sling and metal hooks. Then you need a tarp, the lines and stuff to get it up. It all adds up in bulk, money and weight.
I have gotten rid of all that nonsense, i use
a down quilt
a MSR Hubba tent
a Thermarest XLite mat
an inflateable pillow
It's so much better.
better
More comfortable though?
I’m have a Hubba as well and I prefer my lighter, more versatile, more comfortable hammock.
More comfortable though?
Of course it's more comfortable to sleep on a mattress with a pillow.

With what tarp? What does the hackkock and tarp and all the stuff you need to set it up weigh?
my tent is more comfortable because of the mattress
Car camper confirmed. Sounds cozy.
what tarp?
20D silpoly MiniFly with side pulls, so right at 13.5oz.
My entire setup around 34oz., not including insulation which varies during the year. 
that’s only 16 ounces lighter
Yeah but I also use SmartWater bottles instead of Nalgenes
that’s only 9 ounces lighter
Yeah but I chose a slightly lighter pack
that’s only 12 ounces lighter
We’re already at 2.3lbs, and it just keeps going.
We’re fast approaching the time of year when I won’t need an underquilt, but would still need some kind of ground pad. My 40° quilt (which i use this time of year) is 14oz, which close to the same as most high end mattresses.
Car camper
It's Termarest Xlite.
Hammock is more comfortable. Stop coping. Lighter than you >3lb tent too.

I have used Black Diamond and Merrill for years and am looking to try something new. Merrill can't take the abuse associated with mountaineering and Black Diamond approach shoes aren't as water resistant as I'd hoped. There are also a bunch of hiking shoes with approach shoe features but aren't as aggressive as true approach shoes. They also need to pair well with snow shoes (spring and fall use).
Anyone ever use SALEWA? I like the vibe of these but pictures don't tell all...
What are approach shoes?
Hiking shoes hybridized with climbing shoes.
The toes are significantly improved, the base rubber is selected for tractin in scrambling situations, the lases usually go further down to the toe, they are stiffer in the base than hiking shoes and built to take more side on abuse.
the only thing worse than typing with a broken finger is ho absolute garbage google spellcheck is to use.
I've had a pair of Salewa Mid GTX for about 3 years now, I can't attest for the shoes you are getting but my boots are in great shape and extremely comfortable. I'd say I've probably put close to 1000 miles on them since purchasing.
Tx4 mids for snow. If you are in Na you can find some other la sportiva offerings at oliund.com
Homosexuals wear them at clubs as a signal to other homosexuals that they are ready for a forceful homosexual encounter.
I average over 100k a week in summer. Boots are too heavy for what I do with no benefit whatsoever. If I hunted or worked off trail in the lowland forests I'd get boots but boots aren't good for hiking long range and you only really need them for technical winter mountaineering which I don't do.
Ask me how I know you live in a big city and are obese.
I understand, i was attesting more to the quality of the brand than anything. Good luck in your shoe hunt and happy hiking.
Neither are true, sorry faggot no one pays attention to shoes outside of your gay nightclubs.
I can hear your voice cracking just reading these posts.
much appreciated feedback
Oliunìd
They just have some stuff on the EU market you can’t get in NA.
Neat website. Looks like Euro REI. I hate that 5.10 was bought by Adidas.
I dont climb but I honestly can't imagine they perform either role very well
Like road to trail shoes, silly marketing gimmick for shoes that are shit in both roles
I regularly go from near sea level to scrambling at 6k feet. They have a specific use and that's why use them. I don't know where you live but where I live these (approach shoes) are extremely appropriate for conditions.
how good are approach shoes for bushwhacking if you have to find your own route?
bushwhacking is boot territory
Thanks anon.
there's simply no need for homophobic slurs
Fuck off you faggot double nigger
So i assume these things are really for base jumpers or the like.
Pants are more important than shoes, in most cases, when bushwhacking. As long as the shoes are waterproof and you're not going through swamps. I wear Carhart pants and jacket when bushwhacking and go between high top leather shoes (water proofed) and Keene shoes depending on the time of year and how wet everything is.
I have lots of wild roses, and other thorn type bushes, so the Carhart are essential.
Hbu approach some bitches
eh..?
i had scarpa and dolomite approach shoes and went through the sole in half a year. is there a budget option for approach shoes? i'm already resoling climbing shoes every half year this shit adds up
I personally don't like approach shoes. I wear my Scarpa Mojito for everything, basically. In the city, on casual walks, for alpine hiking and as approach shoes. Super comfortable and nimble. If you don't have issues with your ankles and are not particularly clumsy, I highly recommend them. Had mine since more than 6 years now. Thousands of kilometers on these bad boys.
The upper needs to be leather... goretex would probably also be acceptable.
I have approach shoes with a mesh upper and I need something more water resistant.
just wear normal shoes you autists
Not all of us live in a suburban flatland, anon.
i dont care where you live, you dont need approach shoes lmao
You're a special one

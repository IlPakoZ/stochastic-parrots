Redpill me on alcohol stoves, please.
Good for a back-up plan.
They’re very light, especially on shorter trips when you can only bring the fuel you need. It’s nice to have something you made, if you go the DIY route. And really there’s no reason to not try out a Fancy Feast stove, considering the price ($1 plus a hole punch and whatever trash you have for a wind screen). An often overlooked aspect is how quiet they are; nothing breaks the ambiance of a serene evening in the woods like an iso-butane stove that sounds like a jet engine. The fuel is more common than canisters, not that it really matters.
They say they’re susceptible to wind, but I’m not sure how windy it has to be. I mean I’ve used one in some pretty windy spots, and a wind screen does what it’s supposed to do. Some claim they don’t work at high elevation or in low temps, but again, I’ve used mine at 10,400ft and 20°F (different times) and didn’t notice much difference. The latter took longer to boil, obviously. Shug has a hammock video where he uses one to make coffee on a mega cold trip in Minnesota. I think it was -30°F. He had to prime his, which isn’t means he needed a tiny amount of extra fuel. Some retards on /out/ claim it leaves a residue or soot on your pot, but that’s just flat out wrong.
Boil time is obviously slower than a canister, but it’s a fake metric. Before pack weight was a common concern, Backpacker magazine (and later on websites) needed a way to differentiate gear that served the exact same function. Even after everyone started weighing everything, the weight difference from one canister stove to another is negligible.
How do you put them out in an emergency?
This is a good question.
Smother it with dirt. Dont use water.
You basically just snuff them out with a meta cover. You can store the stove with said cover, and just leave it aside to use the stove. Then just put the covering on top and the fire will be deprived of oxygen, snuffing it out.
metal*
This guy knows about the fire triangle.
Don´t you have to let them burn out all the fuel, unless you want to have it leak everywhere in your backpack, after snuffing it out?
I wouldn´t trust the cover lid.
You store the alcohol in a separate container
Good luck getting it back into the small opening of your alcohol container.
The Trangia is fine. It’s got a very tight fitting screw-on lid with a tight fitting rubber o-ring. You can leave fuel in it with no issues. 
With other style, git gud and figure out how much fuel you’re supposed to use and just let the excess burn off.
Which works better:
Everclear, or denatured alcohol?
I'm a pro at putting things in small spaces just ask your sister
Well one of them costs a fraction of the other, doesn’t leave crap all over your pot, and is labeled as “clean burning fuel for alcohol stoves.” So probably that one.
They make the cooking experience so much more cozy. They are totally silent. Gas stoves are so annoying. They sound like little jet engines and they scare away all of the animals. The problem is carrying the alcohol. I've yet to find a lightweight container that doesn't leak
Yeah denatured alcohol is the best. Methanol burns cleaner and better in the cold but its very toxic
There are a lot of options in Amazon. Nalgene makes 2, 4, and 8 ounce bottles. I’ve been using one for a while. I’ve also heard that contact lens cleaner bottles work well but they’re a little big.
trangia comes with a lid you use to manage the flame and to put it out
you do know trangia right, the finnish brand that started the whole alcohol stove thing and is the backbone of finnish army
pros:
silent
cons:
reliable/ no moving parts
cons:
fuel can also be used to light a fire
cons:
no affected too much by colder temps
cons:
heavier
cons
are you in a hurry? slow down a little Bud, takes 12 minutes og peace and quiet instead of 6 minutes of jet engine noises? Yowhzerzz
They're pretty good, I have one setup which combos with a wood stove and gets a supahot fire going.
Have to be careful with the risk of spilling and you can go through fuel pretty quickly
to add to this. the seal on mine is so good i actually was able to use the alcohol inside after literally years of storage in a hot shed. for me one full stove boils about 2 liters of water. i also like that alcohol as a fuel is a multi use item and is available in far more places than propane, important for cycle touring.
Cope I like to close my eyes and pretend I'm a fighter pilot
Not sure with others, but with my Trangia I just snuff the flame with the damper, then when it's cool screw the lid on.
The lid has a pretty good O ring seal, and I've not had mine leak.( yet.)
I also carry it in a Swedish mess kit where it rides upright and is packed in a bit of foil, so that may help reduce leakage.
gay af 
stop using this shit and just light a fire with wood to warm you at night and cook no need to carry extra weight, get a lighter and that's it
slow asf
My entire stove kit (fuel for two days, pot with a lid, bandana, spoon, lighter, stove, and winscreen) is around 7oz. A fancy feast stove is roughly 0.75oz, one use of fuel is about the same, and a small fuel co gainer is roughly 1oz. The smaller isobutane canisters are roughly 90g/3.5oz when empty. A full one is over 7oz. 
Alcohol is possibly heavier at the start of longer trips. And of course our lives Trangias for some reason, which are the heaviest option. 
Wanted to mention >>2567834 and boil time. It’s true that it takes longer, but it’s such a weird thing to talk about. Sometimes it takes me a little while to cook dinner at home. When I’m heating a pan in my kitchen, I don’t just stand by the stove staring at it blankly. I busy myself with other tasks.
see you got one of the never ones! great kit!
i think it mostly just comes down to what you are used to, ive cooked on Trangias my entire life basically, never had a failure, ive had 2 jetboils that crapped out, yea they are slower, but im not a distance hiker or ultralighter 
so i prefer a system i can basically operate in my sleep with no worries of it failing
You don't go /out/
Aren´t those Swedish mess kits sold for like 70 bucks at this point?
And in this good of a condition...
Lucky bastard.
I´m not sure what to think about burning water in aluminium containers though.
You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You don’t have a plan (probably the most important). You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.
Both are fine. Everclear has about 96.78% of the potential energy of a 90/10 ethanol/methanol (standard denatured alcohol). 
The main disadvantage to everclear is that it can be safely taken internally and alcohol use is a factor in the majority of outdoors deaths.
Neither denature alcohol nor everclear can be used to purify water or safely disinfect wounds. Everclear can be used to disinfect injection sites and surgical equipment. Denatured alcohol is usually cheaper.
Yes, Trangias are the backbones of the Finnish army, but no, Trangia is not a Finnish brand. It is Swedish. Trangias are great though, and they never let us down when enjoying our combat ration packages.
Unless you're in a circumstance where alcohol is the only practical fuel I wouldn't bother with them. Only benefits in the majority of circumstances is they're quieter and slightly easier to source fuel for than your typical camping stoves.
let it cool and pour it back into your bottle
my alcohol stove boils water in like 3 minutes.
worth it. im not outside to stress
How would such an esteemed outdoors man like you survive in pic rel?
what are you guys carrying your fuel in?
You tend to waste fuel and they get kinda messy but they're efficient and a good weight savings. I still prefer a little gas stove, but I've used an alcohol stove camping multiple times and they make do.
Please show pictures of your pot. I’m curious how dirty it is.
Plastic bottle
alcohol stove,
CHEAP FUEL, EASIEST TO FIND ANYWHERE STORES ARE LOCATED
-gas stations in DRY COUNTIES have the fuel, medical type-denatured
-grocery stores have it
-medical stores have it
-some alcohol stores even have it
-outdoor/camping/fishing stores have it too
versus
propane(some regions DON'T have it, or just have one specific BRAND/TYPE/ADAPTER you have to have to use it)
butane(same issue, depends on region/time of year, connectors)
fuel tablets(online only, or buy another "burner set" just for more fuel
if you make the infamous hobostove versions via aluminum cans, it cools down FAST(bonus of aluminum as a material), just remember to have a small funnel and you too can pour the fuel back into the canister/bottle
bonus info, if you DRINK denatured alcohol, those those SHAKES you are getting?!! thats your body's organs suffering poisoning and going into shock
I think they work fine, takes a little longer to boil 
In my experience it works better then gas in when its cold, even if wintergas is used
I used alkohol stores at -30 celcius and it worked good but the gas i hade dident realy want to burn and mostly sputterd
People will hike with an extra half of a pound in their pack for 10 hours just so they can boil water 3 minutes faster. That’s pretty far outside the window of reasonable behavior. I think there’s something else at work here, specifically what I like to call the California Influence.
Americans don’t like to hear it because Californians are generally despised by the rest of the country. But hiking was such a huge part of the culture there, and combined with a high population and disproportionate media influence (specifically Backpacker magazine in the 1980’s), California gained a foothold as the dominant voice in the outdoor recreation conversation. It’s a position they still hold to this day, at least to some degree. 
Unfortunately, the climate in that part of the country is drastically different than Real America. Things like rain gear and shelter choices don’t work as well across all environments, yet solutions are presented as carte blanch answers. 
Alcohol stoves are no different. Denatured alcohol is banned in California now, and even when it wasn’t, there are very wide fire restrictions. So canister stoves were a necessity. The only reason people are using them in other places is because they consider excess pack weight a small price for three minutes of convenience, or they saw reviews and a canister stove is ubiquitous for some unknown reason.
I put mine in an empty liquor bottle. They are lightweight and the cap is good
Who the fuck cares? Do you display your camp pot in the kitchen?
See: >>2568061
Pic isn’t mine but if you use it in a campfire regularly this is what it ends up looking like. I don’t think you do that, but you could prove me wrong by posting a picture (you won’t).
Forgot the pic. I’ll just go play in traffic now.
Not those anon, but I doubt you could do what man has done for a millennia.
Does it still work?
water is perfectly fine for putting out alcohol
And I don't give a shit what some trendy zoomer faggot on /out/ thinks. I've been cooking over fires since the 90s, probably since before you were even born loser.
NTA
Why are you in this thread? You obviously care very much, since you have your shitty, theorycrafted, off-topic opinion and keep coming back to hear what we think.
I'm defending >>2567960 
Sure, you don't want to craft a fire when there's a fire ban due to wildfire risk or when there's insufficient timber/kindling/fuel available like in >>2568578. But in most cases, it makes sense. 
More than anything, I'm sick of seeing the gatekeeping and "you never go out" witchhunting fags who make this board worse than every other outdoors-related community in existence including Reddit and even Facebook. If it wasn't for quality threads like the fishing and homegrowing ones, I wouldn't even come here. The hiking threads are especially garbage because of the holier-than-thou faggots shitting up everything.
t. car camping flatlander
If you seriously believe that making fires can only be done while car camping, let's just end the discussion here because it's obvious that I'm dealing with someone with no real outdoor knowledge or experience
I bet your gear reeks
I’ll bet yours is so immaculate it looks like it’s never been used.
I've never been in a place where there are risk of wild fire, neither a place where there are no timber/kindling/fuel desu, I know those places exist but they're very rare 
for you to cause a wild fire you need to do some really dumb shit ngl, it is hard af to do it 
ppl here never go out and keep on overthinking stuff and spending weeks in the woods, I don't /out/ like that 
I can't spend a week in the woods, I have no time available for that 
also I've never actualy use anything that ppl in here use, to be honest not even knifes
My point was that there are juridsictional fire bans during certain times of the year when the risk is determined to be elevated. For example, Pennsylvania and New York currently have burn bans this time of year. I know this is 4chan where everyone is a super badass who disregards the rules, but it is a consideration for most.
That’s like 20% of the US population. Fire bans happen across the country on national forest land but it’s not as common. It’s dependent on rainfall, and the rain outside of the South West isn’t a strict rainy/dry seasonal pattern. It’s that pattern that’s led to trends in outdoor gear. See above about the California Influence.
I'm 36, what I said still stands.
some anons in this thread will get this and feel really good about it
So a millennial. Same difference. Actually even worse than zoomers now that I think about it.
Dump out your cooking pot and cover the stove with the pot.
Alcohol stoves are trendy with zoomers now? I’m well over 40 so I really don’t know.
Disagree on the fire danger. It's all good until it's not. There are some locations which are just matches waiting to be lit. Agree that that you can take steps to be safe, but that requires common sense which you KNOW is never a guarantee.
It's a dumb comment because anyone who goes out enough knows that practically there will be times that making a fire is a) not worth the effort b) strictly difficult even for a determined person. Some folks never go out in ways that it would matter but plenty do. It's like advising that a 10lb canvas tent is a practical option to the camping public in 2023.
Yeah but the other one is drinkable
Pro:Absolutely indestructable and viable for the whole 3rd world as well. 
Usable under a tarp as a quick warmup option.
Can be used in abandoned buildings while waiting out rain.
Con:
Non adjustable flame. 
Can't be filled while burning which if you have longer boiling can be needed.
Also you need to wait for it to cool down before packing so if you are a sneaky cunt and have to hide it and pack fast it helps to bring a container for holding and packing it away in an insulated manor.
Based dual purpose fuel enjoyer.
I use 198 proof Everclear
Trangia burners come with simmering rings so that you can in fact adjust the flame. Trangias are also easy to put out with the said simmering rings for refilling of the burner.
I can buy a lot of gas for a stove with that. 15+ camps worth.
They updated the course material, it's called a tetrahedron now with the fourth part being the self sustaining chemical chain reaction. 
T. Volunteer fire fighter for a long time.
would an alcohol stove be suitable for warming myself up indoors on cold days?
the fuel seems cheap enough but are there any other costs, does it have a wick?
never used one before but they seem neat and aesthetic. does clean burning mean i can use it without dying from carbon monoxide?
Why not just use the dedicated trangia fuel bottles? They are available in 300ml, 500ml and 1000ml. They don't leak, the fuel flows easily out of the bottle and they can be used for decades. They come in red and green too.
nta but i just ordered one. they look kino in green :)
never used one, been thinking of getting one just because the """child safety""" cap on the denatured alcohol bottles are annoying
What kind of bullshit is that. Also, Pluto is a planet.
fuel weighs more than most isobutane setups. colder than 30 degrees? gonna have a bad time. great for short trips in mild temps.
Literally the opposite of reality. Where do people come up with this garbage? Are they misinformed or just old fashioned retards?
If you've tried these pieces of shit you know they suck compared to a pocket stove. The weight difference is not much but one works every time and boils your water/cooks your food like your stove at home, the other is playing the waiting game. My backup plan is sticks and brush if it's life and death
Here’s Shug camping at -30°F and using a Fancee Feest stove the next morning. He actually has a few ideas similar to this one. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DbiWJV3JSwM [Embed]
Butane canisters fail just below freezing and Isobutane starts to fail in the teens. You can mount them upside down but only if you have a stove made to work with liquid fuel rather than vaporized gas (or both, as is usually the case with liquid fuel stoves). That is, a typical stove like a Pocket Rocket or BRS3000 won’t work. Here’s an article on why canister stoves fail in the winter.

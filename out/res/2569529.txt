All welcome. Originals, low effort, old favorites, familiar memes… all of them. No infographics, please.
"Mountaineers" getting btfo by an ultra-hiking Chad in casual gear
Memes develop due to a common culture and a bare minimum sense of community 
This board has neither of those
Kek that was just like me on Shasta. 
The normies rent $2k worth of stinky plastic boots and helmets with Jerry Curl juice in them and get in the conga line like the good goy they are.
They all take the same route and get thumped by rock and ice from the nerds above them.

When I collected the summit pass and told the qt ranger lady my proposed route she said, "Oh you'll never make it up that way, it's all scree and you'll posthole the whole way". What a dingbat. Do I look like a leppy or something? Sheeeeeit
Just because sometimes you can walk up a glacier solo in running shoes, doesn't mean it isn't a terrible idea. 
The purpose of traveling in a rope team like that is because it is the only way to protect against crevasse falls. If you are solo and fall through a snow bridge, you are essentially dead.
I remember when the jannies kept deleting potato memes and suspending people who posted them, even in threads about food.
That kind of heavy handed, disconnected moderation kills any sense of community before it can start.

Of course I know what it is. It's pathetic consumerism entirely done for bragging rights despite basically being carried up by overpaid babysitters.

I've done a couple gnarly hikes without any gear when i'm overseas, it's a rush knowing the weather could change and wreck you, it's a flex but some people aren't into that and he last thing I would do is belittle people who come properly prepared. The last thing on my mind when standing at a snowy summit is spite towards strangers, and it's fucking genuinely sad that it seems to be your maixag0hyn driving force.

Brofist for my mountain masochist brother.
Prob right, my girl has bad knees so I carry a 70L pack in the summer. She's a sweetie so I don't complain, just grin and bear it.
I don’t understand this meme. Is it implying Americans are gear-queers? Ir that Euro nature is tame and easy compared to the US?
Kek
Implying burgers are fatass consoomers and eurofags are skinny jean wearing minimalists. Fairly accurate
Isn’t ultralight hiking an American thing?
Idk, UL prob came from the pct thru-dorks but endurance athletes are a thing worldwide. I guess you can be one without the other but what's the point of UL if you're not trying to go far and fast?
Just to torture yourself with shitty sleeping pads and overpriced packs that tear if you fart too hard? 
Haven't given it much thought beyond making fun of the UL crowd, been doing that since weight-weenies were a thing in cycling.
skinny jeans
Yuck
It’s an everyone who isn’t a retard and actually hikes thing.
Lolz here we go again with the gatekeeping. 
Yes, the only real hikers are UL, everyone else is a poser, you happy now?
He’s not wrong though. If you hike an appreciable distance and don’t try to figure out a way to lighten your pack then yes, you are in fact a retard.
Agreed but there's some grey area between going lighter and giving your toothbrush the big chop.
He's also implying that you can't make distance without being UL, which is a load of shit. The will and endurance of the person makes a bigger difference than a pound or two in the pack. 
By UL logic, bigger people can't hike because they're already out of the twig category, and I know some big dudes that are beasts in the woods. Hell every timber faller I know can out-hike every nerd in this bread and they could do it carrying a 20 lb saw.
Post memes you puffblubber cock holsters. No one cares about your autistic screeching about meta trivialities
I never implied that you insecure bitch. This anon >>2570547 understands, shedding unnecessary weight out of your pack comes naturally with experience.
He didn’t imply anything, you just inferred it.

Did someone actually post this picture with this caption ?
You can tell by how clean his gear is that he has not hiked 100 miles with it. His gear looks like he just pulled it from the back seat of his Prius.
 You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.
This is me, but it will pay off when I have two teenage sons to hump my gear for me in my old age.
Clear Creek (East side). It's an ass kicker of a day hike but you can overnight near the spring at 9000ish feet in the last scrubby trees. Most of it will be covered in snow this year but that makes it easier imo.
no, nobody posted that. that's just a weak attempt at an /out/ fantasy and is no meme, and has never been posted on this board methinks
It would be funnier if you weren't a butthurt eurotard.
Thinks people that are proficient at map navigation are dumb
Never leaves Cellphone coverage areas
That's like someone who is illiterate saying librarians and card catalogs shouldn't be trusted because they have Alexa.
Look at the eurotards seething. It's so cute they are pretending they can get further than 50 K from civilization. lamo.
Keep coping eurocuks, even boomers with shit gear in the USA can be found on trail systems that are longer than the highways in some of your cuck-countries.

I really didn't need to be told that you're incapable of independent thought. Try editing the meme like someone who isn't completly retarded instead of crying about it with pure reddlt spew.

when I was in scouts as a wee lad the fat old scoutmaster made us put rocks in our pack to practice hiking fully loaded
he was actually a pretty cool guy and we did some cool shit but both his knees were permanently destroyed and he had to wear braces for any real hiking at all. He did a much better job at motivating us kids to lighten our packs than to work our way up to being able to carry 70lb backpacks and feeling manly about it for the decade or so before total patella ejection
Its a mycology meme.
Esoteric but not bad.
Cause you know you can take that damn mountain and you don't need some gatekeeper to mentally dominate you or some fancy gear to give you the confidence.
You know you can climb Mount Shasta, so you climb it. That's it, dead simple. But you could just solo hike or find other hardcore climbers. I mean you could lead your own climb, you are like a sherpa at this point.
It's weird to have this awkward interaction with "the goys" or the "normiesphere"as you call them, by the way I am a Christian not a goy, and I wish you the best in your mountain climbing adventures. Would recommend just hiking established trails or planning a solid route on a map with a compass, or some electric navigation doodad, or at least getting your bearings with the sun and stars.
I have a mushroom knife, very handy for harvesting and cleaning mushrooms
These morels look delicious, a very valuable and highly prized mushroom. No, it is not a hippie mushroom it's a chef's mushroom.
Pick a fucking hobby
Morels
look closer.
Wow, you are right, they look like morels at first glance, but now that you point it out, these appear similar to Early False Morel or Verpa Bohemica.
Easily distinguishable if you cut them open, it is not hollow inside, and you can get the spore print. But you should be very careful to identify it, because there are multiple morel lookalikes that could be toxic.
The cap also hangs off the stem, another sign of Verpa bohemica. I believe it is eaten cooked in small amounts as food, but can be toxic in larger amounts.
https://snowbrains.com/tourists-mountaineering-shorts-sneakers/
redditwalkers arent real
This causes me to physically recoil in pain because I’ve experienced this before. There used to be a trail that was popular locally and I hiked it when I was a kid. My sister who lived hours away wanted to bring her friend from the city to this favorite trail on the weekend. So she invites me and we head out there and it’s like the pic. So many cars. I was internally distraught. I don’t usually do anything out on the weekends because of the tourists, but this made me lose it. I had never seen it so bad before. If I had a rifle I would’ve started shooting. But that wasn’t necessary as a year or so later a family of 9 Mexican tourists were killed in a flash flood nearby.
This is almost exclusively a Coastie ci plaint. There are trails further away, but people are too lazy to drive. Everyone near GSMNP knows it gets crowded, so instead of complaining we go to places that aren’t crowded. We just have to drive a little further or hike a little more.
GSMNP
?
I’m from Arizona. And yes I usually don’t hike those types of trails or hike on the weekend for that reason. But regardless I don’t want it nor like it. Even if I can’t see it I don’t want it happening. Imagine the good people that stay away from hiking locally because they see massive piles of people from the city packing trails.
NEVER NEEDS WASHING
People actually do hike with bags of rocks in order to train strength and endurance, just so the bag weighs a certain amount. Would make you stronger, faster, and able to go further when you hike without the rocks.
It would have helped her greatly to know how to run a trotline or catch fish somehow. An advanced level is knowing how to make animal traps and weapons out of local materials for free in a survival context, or being able to quickly navigate to civilization.
Mushrooms will provide protein, berries can provide energy from sugar and a bit of carbs. In Alabama, lot of swamps and areas have cattails, their roots are actually a great source of carbs. Can be boiled like potatoes or made into a flour. Would not eat the fibers though, but they are useful for shelter and crafting.
Apart from cleanliness she looks to have thrived somewhat, no weight loss and her eyes are clear
Frogposters never go outd....
it says right there she lost 50lbs
probably started out 60lbs overweight and either had the luck or the camera angle/photoshop kept it off her face in the first one
Still, a month of eating mushrooms in the woods without dying means she's probably not retarded, good job
Kind of related, I’m new to out stuff but every time I go out my parents are freaked out bc they think I’ll die or something bc I’m in the woods alone, even other people I talked to when I mention that I go innawoods they’re like omg you go alone without an organized group that makes you pay 200 for a weekend innawoods it’s dangerous, omg you sleep outside and not in a refuge it’s dangerous, ong what if a snake enters your sleeping bag while you sleep etc
Idk it seems most people live on rails so to speak, in fact, although not out related, I think a lot of laws are respected just because people are mentally programmed to stay in their lane and get uncomfortable by even suggesting doing something illegal even if it’s a minor thing, a lot of time I see people make up rules that don’t even exist out of concern and limiting themselves even more
Literal meth head. Probably made the entire thing up. Look more into it.

As you can see(questionable), my post has fucking nothing to do with GSMNP. I’m from Arizona and do all my out in the west.

by the way I am a Christian not a goy
Goyim is a derogatory term used by Jews to describe gentiles, that is, people that are not Jewish.
BTW, there was a party in Germany called the "Goyim Partei Deutschland" from 2016 to 2020. They didn't have much of a following and they where described as antisemitic and far right.
I want a feral girlfriend that brings me wild berries and mushrooms :-)
a month of eating mushrooms in the woods without dying means she's probably not retarded
Anon, i have bad news for you. A month of being lost in woods means you are retarded. All she had to do was pick a random direction and walk for a few days, eventually you come to a river, train tracks, a street or any other kind of man made structure.
every time I go out my parents are freaked out
You have to be at least 18 to post here.
All she had to do was pick a random direction and walk for a few days, eventually you come to a river, train tracks, a street or any other kind of man made structure.
This is true in Alabama, but it's not true if you get lost somewhere that's actually remote like the South Coast Track in Tasmania, where you have to fly in then walk for six days to get out again and there's fuck all permanent human settlement anywhere.
walk for six days
Pick a direction, walk for six days, find people, tracks or a road.
The most common advice when you get lost is just stay put and wait for rescue, especially among normalfags. Sometimes it's a good idea and sometimes you need to self rescue but in general "don't get yourself more lost, you don't know how to navigate in the middle of a forest with no landmarks anyway" is a good rule of thumb. 
A month is a bit long to sit around but if you've got water and at least some food and aren't at risk of freezing then there's not too much that can go wrong doing it, and there's a lot that can go wrong if you get excited and take off in a random direction. You're way better off healthy and in a good spot near a clean water source than with a broken ankle and no idea where to drink or sleep.
I don't know what it's like in Alabama but around here it's nearly impossible to actually walk in even a vaguely straight line for more than an hour, the terrain just doesn't allow it, and unless someone has actually specifically practiced wilderness navigation they're a lot worse at it than they think. People die in the mountains all the time for a reason.
People die in the mountains all the time for a reason.
But they don't take 4 weeks to do so. 4 weeks is a long, long time walking and not finding anything man made or a river.
FOUR FUCKING WEEKS!
Yeah, because they panic and fall in a ravine after 36 hours
4 weeks and alive is better than dead but quick about it
True.
But can we also agree that you have to have severe retardation to get lost for 4 weeks in Alabama?
Also a lot of European countries have free travel rights where people can pass through private property, getting a ticket for that would be more of an American thing. Freedom to roam is what they call it.
Bullshit
Norway or finland aren't like this
Goyim is a derogatory term used by Jews to describe gentiles, that is, people that are not Jewish.
I am completely aware of this and that is exactly what I'm responding to.
In our King James Version of the Bible, we translate "goy" into "heathen" and I'm not a heathen.
I am a Christian, my God is the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, I am bound to His covenant. He has chosen the faithful to enact His will and inherit His kingdom. Not a goy.
walk for six days
Requires surviving for six days in the Tasmanian wilderness
Now that's a Darwinian trial
Agreed.
East coast retards think anyone outside of their urban hell cares about their shit parks. Olympic National Park is one of the most well known parks outside of Yellowstone and no one calls it ONP--that's retarded. Hell, no one calls Yellowstone YNP. It just goes to show how retarded east coasters are.
It's very easy to avoid crowds in the PNW because there is exponentially more park.
Basically WA and Oregon have more parkland that the entire east coast combined--so park crowding really is, predominantly, an east coast phenomena.
Google “GSMNP” and “PNW” and see what happens. Now try ““ONP” and “YNP.” 
Some acronyms are agreed upon and recognized by everyone l. Well, everyone who’s involved. You guys aren’t involved; you’re new. 
Also I like about 800 miles from GSMNP, in the South.
I don't know how the google algorithm functions at all
Yes, you're dumb, we get it.
over 80% of the US. population lives east of the missippi but 90% of the parkland is west of the mississippi...
That means over 80% of the internet traffic looking for parks is looking at 10% of the parks--therefore those 10% of parks will have a higher page rank.
he has never seen RMNP or GCNP used before
lol he doesn't east coast slang
I avoid all the east coast cope threads especially the ones about their shit, overcrowded parks. This was supposed to be a meme thread. Go cope elsewhere about your obviius over inflated concept of your relevance.
Urbanites absolutely on suicide watch. They think they are the center of the world.
Rocky Mountain NP and Grand Canyon NP, both very common acronyms. You don’t spend much time outside. The Smokey’s are in the South, which is most certainly not the East Coast. 
Can someone post pictures of crowded areas on the East Coast that aren’t due to limited parking?
4 hours from Nashville, Atlanta and Charlotte. Seems pretty accessible compared to a lot of western NF’s. The discussion originated from me complaining about my NF, which is two hours from ONE similar sized city. And it’s not even a NP. I can’t imagine how much worse it must be at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park!! Presumably it’s pretty bad since anon thought that’s the place I was talking about for no reason at all. What people back east apparently don’t understand is, I don’t want to run away from the overpopulation problem, I want it to be solved. City folk should stay there.
The funniest thing about east coast overcrowding is that once you go more than 5km away from a parking area most of the people are gone. Yosemite gets 3.5 million visitors a year, and 3 million of them must just fuck around in the visitor centre or do the short flat walks.
those are false morels lol, be careful..
It’s bad all over. The Smoky’s are free to enter but they started requiring a parking pass this year. Yosemite is on the West Coast, and it’s 4 hours from Los Angeles (18.7 million people). Zion is in the SW and is the Disney World of National Parks, and is absolutely the king of overcrowding. It’s not even close. It’s so crowded that there’s talk about requiring reservations for all visitors. Not for certain attractions; you’ll have to reserve your spot just to enter. It will definitely keep the crowds down and piss off a lot of people who drove two hours from Las Vegas. The Grand Canyon is always jammed with cars and traffic has been a problem since the place opened, but once you find a parking spot anywhere in the park you’re good. There’s a free shuttle that passes every 15 minutes so you don’t need to drive anywhere. 
It’s all about knowing when to go and not being a retard. Pic is late September (gorgeous weather) at the most crowded attraction in the Smokey’s. There were maybe half a dozen people mingling around. It was 8:30am. Google “crowded Clingman’s Dome” to see what it looks like at noon on a Saturday.
Amazing knives. Overpriced fidget spinner fans BTFOOOOOOOOO!!!
More east coast retards seething about their shit parks
No one cares about your shit parks. They aren't popular outside your bubble of reards.
It's all about knowing where to go
You basically described the difference between the east and west coast parks.
West cost parks are more numerous and larger so the congestion is at the parking lots. East coast parks are smaller but have more parking--the whole park is overcrowded.
90% of American parks are west of the Mississippi and 80% of the population is east of the Mississippi.
it isn't rocket science but east coasters are pretty retarded.
the whole park is overcrowded.
You’ve never hiked very far.
East coast "park": you can hike completely across the park in 1/2 a day.
Keep coping eastard. I walked all day yesterday in a national park and didn't see a soul on the trail.
Washington state can fit New Jersey inside of it's parks lol.
I don’t think you left your house yesterday.
I love my No.12 Filet knife. It goes through trout and perch like a hot knife through butter.
I remember when skinwalkers were actually spooky because millenials weren’t spamming them on every podcast and website on existence.
I don't think
I noticed.
Keep up the cope.
A group of mountaineers, properly-equipped with boots, crampons, harnesses and snow goggles, were shocked when they came across a couple in casual dress:
“I have never before encountered people at 4,000 meters (13,123-feet) wearing sneakers and jeans… and being absolutely ignorant of the risks they were running,” one of the alpinists, Victor Vicquery, wrote on Facebook. “We tried to dissuade them… but they kept climbing”, he added.
We tried to dissuade them...but they kept climbing

The problem here I this place is infested with reddlt retards. On /pol/ if someone hates your meme it gets edited and reposted and the edit cycle is what refines the meme to kino.
Redlt idiots don't comprehend this basic process--as evidenced by this thread. i
Instead of editing the meme they bitch about it in a circle jerk forum and the result is underdeveloped memes and walls of texts from reddlt retards.
Shut up.
Damn I made this years ago
I was innawoods chatting shit about how rare lymes disease is statistically when you consider the life cycle of an infected tick
Two days later I had the bullseye rash and was diagnosed with lymes following a blood test a few weeks later (thanks NHS)
I've heard there aren't any dedicated mods for this board, jammies from other boards do it and you can hardly expect some fag from /a/ or /g/ to understand
Camping with women is always a pain in the ass. They can't carry as much but they want to bring so much shit you'd think they were trying to build a permanent outpost. They want to bring half the kitchen, tables, chairs, a few canopies, 6 store bought metal rods to cook over the fire (JUST FIND A STICK) and all kinds of shit. Plus they get cold easier
Mclouds are pretty cool though. I also like pulaskis. Once I used a rhino, like a small and sharp hoe, while working on a trail with the USFS and it was amazing. I asked my conservation corps why we didn't have any and they said that the rhinos are really expensive and since a lot of folks in CCs are inexperienced, they get damaged and broken. But those things are perfect for cutting a nice trail as long as the soil isn't rocky. Once you get a feel for it, you can almost move at a slow walking pace cutting a nice trail
whatever you say goy

Is this jade, /out/ ?
Nobody can say from a picture, but if you have to ask, the answer is no. If you really want to be certain that I'm right, you should do a specific gravity test. I'm assuming youre hoping this is nephrite?
I should also add that nephrite is translucent, so if you shine a flashlight on it in the dark, you should be able to see the light permeating the stone. Just from this rocks appearance, I would say it does not appear to have translucence.
I dont know much about jade, but nephrite would be my guess too.
No. That's a rock.
It is translucent, you just dont see on the picture.
Here is some real nephrite I collected last year
If my rock had a smooth surface it would look like yours i think.
It is quite rough.
Where did you find that?
I disagree, I think your stone is an ultramafic rock. Do a specific gravity test and report back. Also put a magnet on it. Is it magnetic?
It is magnetic.
Then it ain't jade
That looks like some sort of pegmatite to me 
Check out this emerald I found in some feldspar and quartz
noice
Pegmatite ass
that's a cannonball from blackbeard's ship. I would urge you to put it down but I'm afraid it's too late... you're cursed now.
not sure honestly but i did get this from a smoke shop today and I dont think they realized they just handed me free money i did a bit of sanding to see the color
No it isn't. 
Jade looks like its all melted like a very dense glass. And you cannot scratch it with the end of your knife.
This looks like a low quality opal or perhaps just not polished
labradorite. not rare, but pretty
labradorite
cool, is it worth anything in the gem market?
hmmmm
not very much
that's a green diamond. 
Holy shit don't tell anyone about this. 
Or they'll rob u
 be me
 hiking in California 
 find a green glassy rock 
 8-10 pounds
 neat
 think man this would make fantastic flints for my flintlock because it flakes so nicely and sparks on steel
 start napping down the rock a piece at a time
 sell a fuck ton of flints out to other mountain man reenactors. 
 geologist bro visits
 talk about churt and flint
 bring up my green rock
 what green rock?
 show geo bro and geo bro nearly has a heart attack, stroke and cancer all atbthe same time.
 turns out my 10 pound hunk of jade was worth some $250-500 bucks. 
Oh well.
That wasn't jade retard. California jade is nephrite, aka one of the toughest natural materials on earth. You couldn't flake it, even with a sledgehammer.
 it flakes so nicely 
Nephrite jade is literally impossible to flake
What a fucking weird fantasy to make up, even had an imaginary geologist.
Since we're on the topic of serpentine
Cali Anon
Ahh that explains it
Aye I found a big ass boulder of dat one time
We have some large formations on a property I frequent, I'll have to snag pics for you guys one day.
Once a man of Ch'u, named Pien Ho, came by an uncut jade in the Ch'u Hills. He brought it home and submitted it as a present to King Wu. Thereupon King Wu had a jeweller give an opinion of it. "It is an ordinary stone," said the jeweller. The King, regarding Ho as a liar, had his left foot cut off. Upon King Wu's death, King Wên ascended the throne, when Ho again submitted it as a present to King Wên. King Wên also had a jeweller give an opinion of it. Again he said, "It is an ordinary stone." The King, also regarding Ho as a liar, had his right foot cut off. When King Wên died and King Ch'êng ascended the throne, Ho, carrying the uncut jade in his arms, cried at the foot of the Ching Hills. After three days and three nights his tears were all exhausted and blood flowed out. At this news the King sent men out to ask him the reason, saying, "Throughout All-under-Heaven men whose feet were cut off are many. Why should you be crying so bitterly?" "I am lamenting not the loss of my feet," said Ho in reply, "but for the calling a precious gem an ordinary stone and for their dubbing an honest man a liar. This is the reason why I am lamenting." Meanwhile, the King had a jeweller polish up the jade and got the treasure out at last. So it was designated "the Jade of Pien Ho"

Yes, I know that the US is better than 90% of these countries for /out/
I rated them based on primarily what I know about what natural landscapes they have available, and to an extent on how good the laws are for accessing them as well.
What do you think?
You havent rated norway and sweden high enough imo
I like going wild camping (as we call it) in the UK because it's a chance to get away from all the bloody people. Especially these days with the mystifying amounts of immigrants that seem to have appeared everywhere.
There's just so many people around because we all live so close together. That nice 0.25 acre lawn you've got out front would be crammed with 3-5 more flats/houses and that would be the norm.
Going to places like the North Yorkshire Moors gives me a chance to find a spot to settle in for a few days, surrounded by nature/"nature", and feel some distance between my soul and everyone elses.
no balkans ratings at all? some of the best /out/ in europe is there
I don't know enough about them and I haven't been to a single balkan country sorry
OP here, I am from england. I live in wales. What you say is somewhat right, although I have quite a large garden without flats and also I haven't observed many immigrants in england outside of some major cities. 
I think that there are lots of great things to do in England and Wales and that England and Wales are the best of the OK group, but just the level of degradation of nature that we have faced along with the high amount of land used simply for agriculture put us in that category.
Can someone explain why Ireland is so bad?
Banshees
You say that as if it's a bad thing
everyone says england is really bad and ireland is exactly the same for /out/, if not slightly worse, so thats why i put it there
Why is it then?
Relatively small amount of land
Heavy use
Long use
Thats all of europe pretty much
Large parts of Ireland are fucking deserted though?
Why is france so high? Not being accusatory, just genuinely curious
ive spent a lot of time in France, hell i even speak French, France has some really nice rivers, rock climbing and very varied biomes, combined with, maybe idunno, on paper, pretty tight camping rules? (rules cant stop you if you never read them) and in my experiance locals dont give a shit
and thats not counting anything to do with the ocean, you´ve got both coasts, and Corsica which is top 3 /out/ places ive been easy
the Netherlands sucks, here's a map. Belgium deserves a higher ranking, ardennes are great.
Tbh, you need a boat to enjoy /out/ the Netherlands if you don't live near one of the red-outlined area. I'm fortunate enough to live right on the upper tip of the long stretch of forest in the bottom right.
everything of note is grey
das rite faggot we're full
It's shit, balkan people are shit, dont come here
coming in a few months. gonna spread my seed amongst the balkans
there are more and larger parts of england which are deserted. 
I found this map online showing the 1km^2 blocks where nobody lives (in blue) and as you can see, Ireland has far fewer uninhabited areas and is much more evenly populated despite lower overall population density.
definetly, boats are great, that's what the country is made for after all limburgbro. I used to love boating with my brother around the area.
Poland
very good
explain this to me
Slovenia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro - Best
Croatia, Albania, North Macedonia, Bulgaria - Very Good
it would be on the border between good and very good but from my experience there there is a decent amount of nature and variety in the nature - on par with germany, but the restrictions are less strict or atleast less strictly enforced. Atleast outside of the tatry
the mystifying amounts of immigrants that seem to have appeared everywhere.
I thought separation of the UK from the EU was supposed to have solved this problem.
There exists people who wouldn't take a boat to the rock out cropping and then walk the entire stretch while listening to pink Floyd's marooned
I don't want to live on this planet anymore
All irrelevant shitholes, only reason the out seems good is the cities are even worse
Slightly, we still lots of EU laws embedded in ours, can't really tell the success until those are gone.
Scotland should be higher. Wales, England and Ireland should at least be good.
agree, the nature might be similar to or somewhat worse (short mountains) than other europe countries but the outdoor laws there puts them a significant step above
The problem immigrants (if you believe in that sort of thing) tend to come from outside the EU anyway.
Downgrade the Balearic islands. Ibiza is absolutely gorgeous, but if you try to spend any time camping you will have local police up your arse with an unlubricated Maglite.
Wales, England and Ireland should at least be good.
kind of agree but I didn't want this thread to become another thread totally focused on people seething about the UK for no reason again
You got it right for Germany and thr Netherlands, Luxembourg, UK. Too densly populated, highways everywhere and ZOGbots patrolling looking for anons that want to go /out/. Except for some parts in Germany like Harz, Schorfheide, Southern Germany. For France, you got it right also, France is very based, wild camping is tolerated almost everywhere. Just as Schorfheide in Germany, the Region in the parc régional du Mercantour, beside Scandinavia, are one of the less densly populated areas in Europe. I see wolf tracks everytime when I go road cycling in the Schorfheide, they're fucking enormeous. I heard Romania is very based also, but they have too much feral dogs with rabies.
Ireland does not deserve to be called "OK" by any measure. A long history of agriculture means there are few large wooded areas, and no large contiguous ones.
There is no widespread culture of bridleways, like in the UK, and a history of large farms means most farm roads/gravel roads are short, and not connected to each other, so if you're doing long hikes or cycling you have long sections of asphalt connecting any off-road section.
Why is Portugal rated lower than Spain/France/Italy?
Norway should be in its own league
fixed
Britain should at least be meh/good. France and Switzerland dogshit, any of the mountains are completely built up and way too many rules.
any of the mountains are completely built up
they aren't
way too many rules
there are no rules in the wilderness, you stupid nigger
Britain should at least be meh/good
seethe twat. any of your eroded hills pales in comparison of the mighty Alps
every mountain in the Alps is built-up
you are a waste of oxygen
anglo seethe
our /out/ is better, we don't need permits to go up hills, we've maintained tradition and not everything's a competition out here
RVssia 
Explain.
what do i have to explain, how good is Russian nature?
Slightly, we still lots of EU laws embedded in ours, can't really tell the success until those are gone.
Top kek, cope harder. It was the EU membership that prevented a lot of illegal immigration in the first place, as France had to stop them from crossing the channel. Also, when your own country dumps raw sewage into rivers, you're in no position to call other places shitholes. What's next, designated shitting streets in London?
what natural landscapes they have available, and to an extent on how good the laws are for accessing them
finland is full
who is this for
Bro I mean is it full of RVs or summing??
Instead of seething at Britain, how about youse start working on making your countries as good as it, or at least trying
my country is one thousands time better than br*tain, despite being in western europe
France stopped none of them you retard
They're all bad. Every single european forest is basically a tree plantation.
This is an american board get the fuck out europeon
br*tain
reddit, go back
Anglo board
Yugyd Va is better than any amerimutt "national park"
I don't honestly believe anyone has been to Slovakia and is therefore capable of rating it.
Not saying that it's bad, but admit, did you just look up pictures and thought, good enough... before rating it?
The Alps alone trumps any american mountain ranges, let's not kid ourselves
The Alps alone trumps any american mountain ranges
what a fucking brainlet
you don't have to go to a place to know how it's like
Huh? How can you know what something is like unless you experience it yourself. Second hand accounts don't count you know...
How can you know what something is like
by looking at it on Google Earth
it's 2023, you stupid nigger
unless you experience it yourself
personal experience is extremely limited, expecially if you are a brainlet like you
unless you have a drone to constantly fly around to look better at the whole picture, but if the imagery is good enough you might just use GE
you dont even have freedom to roam in america
Montenegro is really nice too
its small and officially wild camping is forbidden but even the police will not bother you (if they even notice)
and it's just stunningly beautiful, been there like 4 times for each 1 week
sadly it's like a 15h drive from Germany where i live
also i would disagree with Germany
while yes wild camping is not allowed (and mostly not tolerated) and there aren't huge untouched forest like you'd find in eastern europe
it's very very well touristically developed
my parents make 2-3 weeks bicycle tours every year in summer for example, and they always find beautiful routes and camping sites
I tend to d similar tours but on less developed paths and and there are so many well documented and wonderful routes
for the classic multi day /out/ tour it's of course less suitable
but so are be france, austria or poland, greece etc. which have kind of similar situation to Germany
Belgium
OK
Nah. Nature don't even exist in Belgium.
I lived in Ireland as a kid, and compared to England it is beautiful. The western counties are quite rural. You have not seen green until you've seen Ireland. I've never been to Scotland, but from the pictures, it pretty much looks like Ireland.
great picture
have nature OC
compared to England it is beautiful
I've been in both place and it is remarkably the same
no, poles out, pakis in, as they say
Slovenia should be filled in. It's better /out/ than half the dark green countries
yea nah its a shithole
They unironically destroyed most of their ancient forests a couple hundred years ago. The rest is bog.
Ireland is the most ecologically devastated part of Europe, there is no actual "wilderness" left and native rainforest accounts for less than 1 % of the landmass and is severely fragmented. Nearly every inch of land is privately owned and developed, farmers will convert anything and everything into agricultural land (on paper) to claim farm payments which means they all have incentives to destroy whatever's on their land and replace it with green carpet or sometimes nothing. Also no rambling rights, you dare not even walk through manys property, and its all small holdings.
My nearest range has half of it fenced off with big signs threatening walkers, and there's literally nothing nothing up there but wet bog. So fucked up
AS sad as it is though, I find a strange serene beauty in the quiet bleakness of our barren country
Ireland has a cultural tradition of ribbon development and lots of people still want to live "outside the town" for reasons that are to me stupid and unsustainable. You really can't drive 500m anywhere without passing someone's home
if you go /out/ down there you'll step on a landmine
honestly I cant understand why Scotland is not top-tier. The highlands are empty, full of forest and majestic as fuck. Ireland is also great for /out/ stuff if you are not a pussy and can handle some harsh weather. Ireland and scotland are /out/ for hardcore motherfuckers, spain, france italy etc are easy mode in comparison.
t. hiked and bike toured in northern and southern europe

Bongs still don't know how bad they have it huh?
why Scotland is not top-tier
low biodiversity, degraded landscapes,
smaller area than other top tier places
scotanon here, get yourself some proper whisky
the famous grouse is "cooking whisky" or to be less formal, the type of drink hobos kill themselves with 
trad larpers replace the letter U with V to be trad or something

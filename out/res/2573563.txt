Ever been caving or cave camping? Lots of cool stuff to see, some people today even explore and name unexplored regions for underwater caves and other areas. I live in a mountainous region with thousands of caves going back to ancient times. It is not hard to find a cave to set up a tent in, to be safe from the elements. Makes me think of the monks of Sinai and the Zhongnan mountains.
Yeah come on down anon. Set up camp for a night or two. It gets lonely down here...
Not sure what I'm lookin at here bud
if i had to guess probably bats
you could not fucking pay me to spend any amount of time in any place with no chance of excape if the entrance collapses or some weird shit goes down. nope nope nope. no fucking ocean shit, no desert island shit, no caves, no towers, no sewers or drains
When you cum into my cave I’ll have you know, that’s not water dripping on your head, babe. Stay away from caves, normies. They(us) will devour you.
No our caves are small
Would
I had a dream about cave camping
We were loading up our gear to try and ambush them when my alarm woke me up. 10/10 most entertaining nightmare ive had in a long time, would go hunt subterranean humanoids with my /k/ buddies
An even smaller cave or just outcropping is good protection from wind and rain in a pinch.
This is called Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, in Appalachia. It's the longest cave system in the world, sometimes I wonder if people live in there secretly like squatters. Smaller caves are going to be vacant really and decent for quick shelter or concealment. Also sometimes bears live and hibernate within them.
Woops, here it is. It is a massive, winding system.
I don't know why you would collect its head but even a scalp would be a war crime. It depends on if it's human or some nightmare creature that you were dreaming about.
because a head makes a better trophy and more compelling evidence of a newly discovered humanoid. We wanted to get rich off of the discovery 
It was just a dream, so it was just some nightmare creature, not human. it also wouldnt be a warcrime since we werent at war
I could lie and write a compelling greentext pretending it was a real encounter, but I wont
I've done this, it wasn't what I expected and probably won't be what you expect. Unless you do it in the Summer expect the cave to be wet and humid. If it rains, you'll have a stream going down the floor and condensation will form on your tent and clothing. It's a bitch even to find a cave not owned by the state because local grottos gatekeep their seekrit spots hard. They don't want idiot kids spray painting the walls or leaving trash, but it means you need to introduce yourself, post in their forums and get in their good graces before they will share a list of coords with you. Do that first, cave camp only in Summer, ideally in an arid state. Don't make a fire, bring self-heating rations, there's lots of canned soups and coffees with this feature. Bring lots of spare batteries for your light, have a spare light to see by when changing batteries in the main light, piss into a bottle, shit in a plastic bag, and pack everything out with you.

I have been cave camping and this is true. You should expect the condensation to be so bad that your own breath will end up dripping back down onto you.
Don't camp in a cave. Camp outside a cave and explore separately.
have you read Road to Heaven? hearing about the hermits that live there really inspired me to take practice seriously and reduce spiritual materialism. 
supposedly theres a hermit that lived in the canyon east of here, and even had some small vegetable gardens cut into the rock. i think he died from hypothermia a while back now
probably

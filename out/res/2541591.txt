I'm not asking /biz/. They're retarded.
Keep it, take it to auction and say you inherited it or that you or a relative (preferably a dead one) bought it in a foreign country years ago, or think of a better fake background. That’s just off the top of my head
If it is marked gold, melt it down and reform into jewelry. Modern gold has radioactive particles in order to indicate origin, so be careful with it.
The one piece is real
You that guy who posted about finding lost gold in some park, and uploaded some video about it?
This is the correct answer. You can't legally own anything that you find in the ground or in the ocean. You either get to have it as a decoration and conversation piece in your house, or you can try to sell it by claiming
my relative died, I was cleaning out their house and I found this
Melt everything I guess, that will destroy and historical value and marks.
That judge is such garbage. Until judges/attorneys like this start facing personal punishment stuff like this will keep happening.
So much historical gold has probably been melted down because of faggot laws like this. A real shame.
What if you claim you found it on your own private land? Buy a metal detector, dig some holes in the yard, and pretend it you found it there
Most civilized countries have cultural and antiquity protection laws. Optimistically, you'd get 50% of value, in cash, but not get to keep anything.
That's a bad idea because of what the other anon said. Artifacts and historical items in the ground belong to the state or federal government. My state has very strict laws on that kind of thing. Even hunting for them is technically illegal. If you find something here you're better off putting it in a glass case on your wall and showing it to your friends and family.
Didnt know this about gold but they are also doing this to Rhino horns so the chinks cant get them through airport security.
Don't fucking tell anyone. Separate it into different locations that are locked up at minimum. I would maybe display some of it at home varying on what it is, some of it I would maybe pawn. But don't evet fucking tell the government your they'll fuck you over if not outright shoot you over it.
To add: as a old family proverb of mine said "the less the government knows, the better." If you found something, shut the fuck up and stop talking about it.
It belongs in a museum!
better tell the government
Why are boomers like this
No, fuck off statist cuck.
Shit like this is heavily tracked. People will ask questions and investigate. Absolutely no fake story you come up with will hold under serious scrutiny.
If it's something with any significant value immediately contact a lawyer and let them handle it and get whatever I can out of it. Not worth dealing with the government if you can get someone else to do it for you.
I saw that article. I was tempted to post it here. The problem is, he has absolutely zero proof that they did actually take his info and use it.
If you find undisclosed treasure in a public area, like international water, you have salvage rights (laws change by jurisdiction, hire a lawyer to be certain). 
Tommy Thompson didn't go to prison for finding treasure and selling it. The reason Tommy Thompson went to prison is because he was funded with over $20 million to find the shipwreck and salvage it, and then he illegally salvaged it without authorization, then sold a bunch of the gold and stashed the money in offshore accounts to try to outplay the people who funded the expedition and salvage operation in the first place.
So, in short - don't be a fucking scumbag that rips people off, and you won't go to prison for being a scumbag for ripping people off.
Look at his polo shirt.
Laugh at the irony.
Losers
Weepers
smelt it all down and learn how to make jewelry and sell it online.
So he's in jail over a civil dispute? Women divorcing their husband have committed far worse than that yet they don't spend a single second in prison.
No, >>2542909 this poster is a retard with a toddlers reading comprehension. Tommy went to jail because after he found the gold and brought it back, the insurance companies that originally insured the ship in the 1850s sued for lost profits. Because of the suits, he sold like $50 million and said that was all of it, but evidence shows there’s a lot of gold not accounted for, so he’s in jail for lying to the court. They call it perjury.
even on private land? Even in the US? Wtf Commie shit is that?
Isn't this the guy who literally stacked it in plastic bins and left it underwater to come back for later?
Gee I'm sure glad we have excellent laws to protect us from... Having a few hundred/thousand bucks due to finding some old stuff. Yeah. Great.
a company can sue in the modern day over a ship they lost one hundred and seventy god damn years ago
What the fuck kind of stupid ass greedy logic is this? How is this allowed?
His shirt should say losers weepers don
I used to find old tins of gold coins when I did land surveying for the railroad. Anytime I'd fine an old homestead foundations I'd metal detect. People didn't use banks back then. Most I foundat once was about 30 grand in old Morgan dollars.
finders keepers looser's weepers nigger.
Do you think the FBI employs random metal detectorists to randomly search forests/beaches for gold? Do you think they just "happen" to find 7 tons of gold right after they were alerted to the existence of a shitton of gold in a specific location?
Female privilege is real despite what you heard
Take it and hide it. Before im hung from the gallows by the global homo finally disclose ive left everything in one piece.
I read about this a good deal and am a detectorist as a hobby. People usually go nuts when something valuable is found and it can go a many ways.
1. You find something, someone hears about it, they find you: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3341003/Bodies-Montana-believed-mother-son-vanished-month-ago-gold-bar-worth-half-million-dollars.html

3. The feds say what you found belongs to the Spanish: https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/01/world/europe/spain-u-s--treasure-dispute/index.html
4. Maybe you found something, maybe the army took it from you, doesn't matter you're dead: https://www.legendsofamerica.com/victorio-peak-treasure/
5. You just pay taxes on it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_Ridge_Hoard
6. Your finding it doesn't stop you from being a retard scammer: Tommy Thompson
Best advise: minimize the knowledge of you finding it, move it as quietly as possible to a safe location, shut the fuck up until you can talk to the right person to buy/sell it. Risk in all aspects. Dad always said, "Shoot, shovel, shut up."
You think that's bad? Look into how the idea of "mineral rights" came to be.
I don't know about treasures and antiquities, but my state at least has decent laws with regards to fossils and shit: finders keepers basically lol.
Lol what a moron.
You want my dead man's switch?
You can have it
I've gathered everything I found in one place 
Now you just have to find it
Thanks for the reading material
In a similar vein, I've always wondered what the laws about hurricanes/floods/natural disasters are. Like if a hurricane hits, and someone's toolbox floats into my flooded house, is it now my toolbox?
laws that have been in place for decades
"MUH BIDEN MUH UKRAINE"
Subhuman with /pol/ brainrot.
Can someone who knows more about this than me say why he won’t just tell court where the rest of the gold is? He says he doesn’t know but that has to be bullshit. Surely being a free man with no gold is better than being locked in prison
invent claim to mass quantity of gold
government demands their cut
refuse to tell them
get free room and board courtesy of the government 
???
profit
Shit thier advice. You should melt it if it's gold or silver and sell it.
Modern gold has radioactive particles in order to indicate origin
what?
that cant be true
Diamonds have microscopic engravings as identifiers
Even in the US? Wtf Commie shit is that?
The concept of US "freedom" is almost entirely baseless propaganda.
it unironically is sort of true but they're not some tracking feature just that everything manufactured in earth's atmosphere after the atom bomb does.
Yeah they scavenged the Imperial German Fleet from the bottom of Scapa Flow to get non irradiated steel for the Apollo cosmic ray detectors. Every bit of metal smelted since Trinity is a tiny bit radioactive.
That doesn't make any sense.
I think in the UK you own it under prospector's rights. If you didn't dig it up with a metal detector, it'd still be in the ground, and no one would know about it, so you might as well own it to encourage it. But it's different if they find something whilst building something else

That's called looting.
Nigger.
There's inheritance tax here
What the headline doesn't state is that he's not in jail for not disclosing the location of his find, it's that he swindled investors of his treasure hunt out of $22mil and fled to the Bahamas.
fucking killed me lmao
Hey, that cunt kept my skateboarding ramp I built with my dad when it floated into his lawn, so I'm keeping his toolbox.
i think flotsam/jetsam laws only apply to boat cargo
In November 2018, Thompson agreed to surrender 500 gold coins salvaged from the wreck of the Central America, but then claimed he did not have access to the missing coins.[10] On 28 November 2018, a jury awarded investors $19.4 million in compensatory damages: $3.2 million to the Dispatch Printing Company (which had put up $1 million of a total of $22 million invested) and $16.2 million to the court-appointed receiver of the other investors.
He fucked over investors that bankrolled his search2gtmr
It's been passed down in your family for generations, and/or grandpa bought it before your parents were even born.
Because he's in for perjury, according to 
You'll never escape the radioactive Jew.
And what stamp and serial number are you going to apply to your new ingot? That's right; none.
Shit for brains.
It's a little abstract, in my opinion.
Why does the insurance company even need the extra 50 million dollars from a ship that wrecked 170 years ago?
What will they do with that money?
Will they pay it out to all their employees? Will they somehow re-invest it into the business? Will they use it to approve and pay out insurance claims?
I mean, humans are greedy. Humans always want more. But a company is just a company, an abstract organization So I don't get it.
why do boomers trust the government so much
30 grand in cull morgans is like 1500 coins. How big was the chest?
Imagine being in the meeting where some dude proposes this as a solution. Absolutely mad.
A few times a year I hear about people who get caught running incredibly lucrative scams or drug busts that include millions in cash, and I always wonder if the criminals were smart enough to bury some of their earnings. They have to be, right? If they’re smart enough to launder money then they have to know that burying gold bars is the safest insurance against a bust. 
Then think about the East Coast, ifs lack of public land, and ifs high density of organized crime. There’s some buried treasure out there, and it’s probably not that far from the road.
that cant be true
Why do you think Gold bullion is 99.9% and not 100%? Its not like gold melts at room temperature
Which third world shithole country is this?
the United States
You should keep it and sell it bit by bit to collectors discretely.
Then buy it from me, tax free, and I will gladly sell it to you!
Oh, that's not how it works?
You instead try to confiscate it from me and fine or jail me for even finding it!?
Fuck you then!
You can never make something 100% pure. If you’ve ever seen 100% pure gold I know you’re a liar.
You can get to .9998 or .9999 “fine” or “very fine”, but never 1.0.
You would do almost exactly the same thing you’d do if you manufactured a new firearm: you’d get it professionally assayed, and then once you had that data, you’d stamp your own name/address, the metal content/purity, and a serial number of your choice on it. Nothing about that is illegal or unsaleable, as long as the stated metal content is accurate.
A company is run by humans, and as you said, humans are greedy.
It doesn't need to be any more abstract or complex than that. All it takes is one person, be it a middle-manager or the CEO, who can use the recovery as a means to get a raise/bonus.
1.
Do your nation/state have a finders fee
2. 
What constitutes finding? If its shaky such as in USA, always report it in parallel to something like a news organization
Always secure legal help if bounty payout is dubious 
3. 
Is it hard to claim you inherited the deed for a cabin in the middle of fucking nowhere, and found some coins stored there?
4. 
Don't make a god damn fundme if you just plan to scam the investors
sell it in small quantities to pawn shops. 
or say i inheirted it from a dead family member, pay the taxes on it and sell it wholesale in auction. coins like that are probably worth more than gold melt value.
look at this commie nigger questioning private property
Do they intend to keep him behind bars indefinitely? What's the end game?

In the new Cormac McCarthy novel, the guy loads up his truck with gold coins and spends a few weeks pawning them across multiple states. That sounds about right.
He will probably go to debtor's prison after this, so yeah he will be behind bars until he dies.
so what is picking up a penny on the sidewalk then?

Oh
once upon a time a lot of people lived in a high trust society where the state at the very least put in a lot more effort to seem like they were acting in people's interests. Democratic parties would even sit down and have a genuine discussion on how to solve problems within the country instead of calling eachother literally Hitler
The purest gold ever made is 6 9s Fine, ie .999999/1.
The 100 kilo coins the Canadian Mint made were 5 9s fine.
Dickheads in my village found old coin, they sold it to pawn shop for 100 dollar to buy vodka. Those coins later was sold to private collector for 50 thousand dollar
biz is retarded
Yes, yes they really are. I decide today to not bother with that board at all anymore. They won't ever help you make money, let alone get rich. It's just spam and memes.
You seriously think PMs become worthless if melted down and you're calling others shit for brains? Jesus Christ anon. Gold with no stamp or serial number is still gold
Well your govt did its work to make sure all your people are alcoholics because it makes you a more compliant workforce/ slaves/ meatshields. Biolenism is real
Anyways, those dickheads couldn't have ever approached that private collector. The collector wouldn't have taken them seriously. Its not so different from a Pokemon card. Its just cardboard. But some of the paper is worth more no reason, then its sent to get graded and suddenly collectors are interested. The pawn shop is the grader who validates the value of the coin. 
If you look at this from a GDP perspective, that coin is worth 50100 dollars + some vodka because ownership transfarred twice, thus making your economy better.
Truman show
you fucking retard. you think the government is in charge of anything? why does a horsefucker literal 
troon know more about politics than you people.
Listen fagglet. The government doesn't control shit. The stock market and rich people don't either. All investment capital started in early banking establishments built around one thing and one thing only: insurance. The slave trade /pol/ and redditors seeth eternally about? 90% of all of the profits from that are still tied up in loyds of london. And that's not even the beginning of it. Insurance companies did the equivalent of mining the miners, skimming off the profit of merchant companies by leveraging themselves as middlemen to a multitude of investors, at a time when it was considered illegal for Christians' to do any of it in many places. These companies land their profits are the new world royalty. their dynasties lay privately beneath the entire fabric of society. The entire us government could be slaughtered to the last man and unless these guys where dealt with nothing would change. It doesn't even matter which side of the political spectrum you larp to be on (it's all a puppet show anyway). The reparation money joggers seeth about? these guys still have all of it. they where instrumental in establishing and creating the federal reserve. They own you and everything you lay eyes on. 
you want to talk about magic internet money. nothing tops the wealth generated by this brief period of colonial trade. do you not remember all the times you where told in school these voyages where considered a success if even one ship of many made it back? imagine if you could just throw money into a game company, and they churned out 10 titles, one of which was basically guarantied to do more than cover all the losses on 9 complete flops. thats the kind of market it was.
Pretty much all metal now is contaminated with radioactive elements post-atomic weapons usage. It's made precision instruments difficult to manufacture now because their materials themselves are compromised in some small measure by this.
This is also true, it's why baddies in movies and video games often seek uncut gems for payments. Accepting gems for payment IRL is retarded though.

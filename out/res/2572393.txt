I was out on a day hike today and came across this skull fragment. Doesn't quite look like a deer, I can't figure out what it is. Found in the Sierra Nevada, for reference
I'm not to good at this but judging by the molars definitely so kind of herbivore, maybe omnivore. Got any more angles?
That's a pretty long skull, where do you live?
Northern California, within 100 miles from Lake Tahoe
I'm guessing it's a black bear skull. Like I said this isn't my specialty but it looks pretty similar. If I had to guess this was most likely a juvenile.
Man that's awesome, I've found Leg bones and ribs of deer before but if it's a bear then it's a great trail souvenir
Pretty neat find man. I can only find seashells in the hills where I live.
Do you live near the ocean? I live in the mountains so it's all freshwater stuff where I live
Looks like raccoon.
Here's another raccoon skull.
Surprisingly... Kentucky. Maybe I just have awful luck but you can find shell fossils across the state.
Look at OP's hand, that would be a pretty big raccoon don't you think?
Yes but OP could have small hands. The occipital ridge is what's leading me to think raccoon, but it could be a juvenile bear.
Ok, now I'm leaning toward juvenile black bear.
The infraorbital foramen looks like a black bear.
coon
definitely a sperm whale
how i know, "you just know"
If you think that's a raccoon you are too young to be on this website?
tits or gtfo
TAKE ONLY MEMORIES YOU SICK BASTARD!
Bones are memories

Far wandering Chicago Nigger Crab

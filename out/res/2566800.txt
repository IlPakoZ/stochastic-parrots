First for best telescopic rod is the one you exchanged for a 3pc.
Talk about fishin
bro her teeth?
Leave it as a thumbnail
Caught me a couple of stock trout yesterday. And by a couple I mean 7, but they're stock trout, they're not exactly hard to catch. They were loving the Mepps spinners. Thinking on targeting SMB tomorrow.
Take the pole fishing pill.
Based
Did it yesterday.

thoughts on a zodias?
my two baitcasters are a zodias (7'2 MH-F) and a rebellion (6'10 MH-R). Zodias for topwater/pitching/flipping and trolling deep for large pike/musky. The rebellion for cranksbaits, swimjigs, basically everything else. Also a Med-Lite St. Croix Premier spinner for ned rigs, texas rigs, weightless worms, etc. I think Rebellion and Zodias are the best bang for your buck multi purpose rods on the market right now. Can't go wrong with either although if you want to spend less St. Croix triumphs and Fenwick HMG's are great and more than capable. They are my back ups.
was looking at the 7' light spinning for neds/keitechs
considered the levante too but seems people have bad things to say about dealing with their warranty process
I've had great experiences with shimano, daiwa and st. croix and tend to avoid everything else besides fenwick for affordable/back up options. Fenwick also has good warranties for many rods (HMG is lifetime) yet the service isn't the greatest, sometimes a long wait for a replacement which is why I like them for back ups.
i'm usually a st croix/fenwick guy but wanted to branch out into something a bit more high end as i like to finesse fish
you won't go wrong with a zodias or rebellion
Hey anons, I have a river running through my land with lots of bream and bass and catfish in it, I want to eat more fish to be more self sufficient but I'm a bit paranoid about all the crap in rivers like farm runoff and plastics etc, the river comes out of a reservoir and it's not a very big river, should I be concerned about increasing my fish intake?
should be able to get a water test kit and correlate it to accumulation in fish
generally stay away from really large fish as the bioaccummulation is worse
in Ontario they have suggested eating guidelines, i primarily fish on a large inland lake (with very little cottages) and they have a guideline that says roughly like 2-4 walleye a month, 2-3 pike a month, 10 crappie a month, etc. The fear for my area isn't even about runoff pollution it's about acidic rain. What you're targeting also matters. If in doubt younger fish should always be safer
I’m going to throw swimbaits and nobody can stop me
how shit are eva grips
Good ones are fine and they are better than cork if you’re gonna just leave your rods in the weather in your boat or whatever. 
That said, I hate them.
what don't you like about them
What do you catch with these and when are you supposed to use them? I've had little luck with swimbaits.
moss green or onyx power pro?
camo 832
It's not hard. The hard part is fighting yourself from putting down your swimbait shit and going back to conventional lures when you don't get bit after ~30 minutes. 
If you can fish a spinnerbait, you can fish a soft swimbait. If you can fish a crankbait, you can fish a crankdown swimbait. If you can fish a jerkbait, you can fish a glide bait. If you can fish a whopper plopper, you can fish a wake swimbait.
I need a good way to store jigs with trailers. Mixed plastic types including elaztech stuff. Any suggestions?
Striped bass and LMB. Pretty much fish them anywhere you’d fish any other lure. Whenever I fish swimbaits I make sure it’s the only thing I bring, it takes dedication and consistency just like the other anon said. When it does produce it’s usually a good fish
How they feel. I have a bit of tactile sensitivity, and the feel of EVA Foam makes my whole forearm just lock right the fuck up. I first had this problem with a little pencil grips that my first grade teacher gave me to try and get me to stop holding a pencil with a death grip.
There’s no good reason, I just can’t deal with it.
cork feels and looks much better than foam. foam starts getting dried out and bad feeling after a year. I don't understand why some high-end expensive rods still use foam instead of winn grips or cork. at least you can maintain cork.
green because it just looks like algae. I've caught fish on straight moss green no leader.
Are monofilament lines dead or do you guys still use it?
Still using some 12lb Big Game and 8lb Izorline XXX Super Co-Polymer.
this pisses me right off cause i'm looking for a high end rod and keep seeing this eva dogshit
wouldn't say dead but i mostly use copolymers instead of mono
Trilene XL is still one of my go to lines. Anything 8lb and under is very limp and extremely strong for it's rating.
Berkley big game 12lb is my go to leader material. Comes in a big ass spool for cheap, and the stretch is super forgiving
Hi vis yellow, colour the last 10 feet or so in with a sharpie
Mono is alive and well
Same, trilene xl is hella
TFO rods are solid
1/8 minimum rating fine if i plan on using 1/16th jigheads accounting for the plastic?
yeah. every rod is different though and sometimes rating means fuckall anyways. my rod rated for 1/8-1/2oz throws 1/16oz lures very well.
take the fannypack pill
forgot pic
*fly vest
high speed low drag
my man
I like my backpack so I can hold some water. I would downsize otherwise.
I use a backpack in the cooler months, but in the summer your back gets sweaty instantly.
I feel kinda kooky wearing trendy clothes branded stuff, but I really like this salty crew fanny pack. It fits my lipper, pliers, water bottle, soft plastics, leader spools and 2-3 boxes.
i've got a big flambeau backpack, its so loaded down with shit and heavy as fuck but i love having everything with me
That's a good piece of kit.
Ya I'm happy with the setup. I keep about 6 different boxes in my trunk and switch them out depending on what I'm targeting.
I committed to the swimbait and caught a nice LMB from a super pressured urban pond
I'm almost completely new to fishing. Should I jump right into fly fishing or get a spinning rod and reel first? Both seem fun but most of the fish around here are trout so I want to fish what's actually available.
I would see what other people are fishing at the spots you want to go to. Doesn't really matter either way but better to get a good start fishing at places where you choice of gear works good.
Post dinks
Fly fishing
I make tapered leaders with this stuff
Fly fishing has a higher entry cost and skill floor, but when done properly catches more fish. Other forms of lure fishing as well as bait fishing are cheaper to get into and easier to do well, and target a wider variety of fish, but will be outperformed by competent fly fishing. If you intend to target trout exclusively, I'd say go for fly fishing, especially if you'll primarily be fishing in rivers or streams where flies are at their best and bait/lures at their worst.
Thanks. There is a local fly fishing store in my town, so I'll ask them about it tomorrow. Probably should have asked actual professionals first but I thought I'd ask here first before committing to a course of action.
How much higher is the entry cost? Will I be able to get a decent start with say, $250? I don't plan on targeting exclusively trout, but in my local area literally every stocked body of water has trout.
Did you guys run out of good looking women? Can someone other than a raging homosexual come up with #473?
Guys, does tenkara make you a gay?
Both meme fishing like fly fishing or tenkaea make you gay.
Just look at the biggest fly fishing autist on this gen
fly fishing is based
pole fishing is based
therefore tenkara is based
I bought a cheap Chinese rod as a backup and the segments keep separating when I cast. Will ferrule wax help seal the connection or should I use adhesive?
bros i'm finally going fishing tomorrow after a 6 month hiatus 
Of course i will only be going for perch and crappie as everything else is out of season. I will NOT target bass, walleye, pike or musky. Not me. Law abiding citizen
Wax will help. I would try it before I resorted to turning the rod into a 1 piece.
If i was going to buy 1 fly rod right now with the intent to purchase 1 more next year what would you go with? Everywhere i look recommends a 5 wt although if i bought a 5 wouln't i go up to 8 or down to 3 next year? Would a 6 this year and a 4 next year make more sense?
what are you targeting?
I plan on targeting everything from brook/brown/rainbows to smallmouth/largemouth and salmon/steelhead
I would get a 5 wt to start. You'll have a better idea of what you need after you've fished for a year so don't worry about that not.
This one's for the alcoholic hobo fisherman /out/ists, couldn't find a better thread
Is there a decent ultralight corkscrew? This one is all steel and kind of full featured and I think I could lose 70g here easy
i'm noticing a lot of the same lengths and actions/powers between some brands, are these just the same blanks being used but their separate hardware added?
You'll be just fine with $250
That'll get you an Echo base combo, a couple leaders, some tippet, a fly box, and some flies.
No, just a weeb 
Fly fishing is for homos, tenkara is for weebs 
If ypu want your first with intent to add more later get a 4 weight and learn to fly fish small stuff (panfish, dink bass, trout) then add an 8 weight for pike, bass, carp, saltwater, etc. As you fish more with those two combos you'll figure out if you want to add a 2, 6, or 10 weight fly rod to your arsenal.
Yes definitely start on a 4 then add an 8 later 
Just catch and arouse a male duck and use his penis, the lightest cork screw is the one you don't have to carry. If you don't like that option amd already carry a multi tool just get a drywall screw, screw that in to the cork, then grab it with the pliers and pull.
sometimes... but usually not. the reality is that they aren't the same blanks, they just slap on a generic rating that doesn't even feel the same between rods. you can pick up two rods that have the same rating, and they don't feel the same. ratings can be off by a noticeable amount.
whats your preferred crawfish bait?
rage craw
OSP dolive craw
no i meant bait FOR crawfish, in trap
small net for goldfish, walk along rocky bottoms, lift up rocks, etc find them net behind BANG catch em
chunks of worm drowner
Any predator that feast on fish in the given size
Presenting babby's first babby spotty.
Finally went bay side fishing again after skunked here two years ago, and haven't fished much in general the past two years. Beautifully sunny on the coast and overcast across the bay. Mostly wanted to focus on my casting so I kept my expectations low on actually catching anything. Three casts in, the spool dumps a bunch of line and is a tangled mess. Spent a couple of minutes seeing if I could salvage the shit but ultimately cut it off and retied. No problems with it after, so perhaps I had it overfilled?
Was throwing a 1/8oz ball head jig with a 3" Reins Rockvibe Shad. I'm a bad judge of distance, but there wasn't much in terms of castability, maybe 30 yards at best. Supposedly the Cays are pretty shallow so I wanted some distance to get into deeper water. Didn't end up mattering too much since I got this guy pretty shallow to my surprise. Bumped up to 10g as the tide went out for more distance and caught one more dinker before heading home.
Pike, bass, musly, trout, cod, salmon, literally anything that can eat something of that size, 10cm pike eat 15cm swimbaits
Anyone have experience with Lucky brand fish finders / depth finders ? The fact that they make standalone units that don't require a smartphone really peaks my interest, only people making these that aren't a boat unit or pair with a smart phone as far as I know.
Just get put gear then, you can get more than enough for that amount
Your setup generally isnt that important, the bait is. You can fish a broom shaft with the correct shit in the end and catch fish, i have. Having great and expensive gear just means a better and more accurate fishing experience. For a beginner literally anything will do. Literally, so dont stress it at all
how do I catch these niggas? they don't follow lures or worms and are a plague in my zone now because their predaintators are dying
Are those smelt? Sometimes I catch them on wax worms when I'm ice fishing for perch
What kind of storage can I fit in a fanny pack? I only have 3600s
depends on the fanny pack. 3500 fits perfectly in mine, just enough room to get it out without struggling.
What is that fish?
Arrived here at 6am
It's 7:36 no bites
I'm 007
0 bites
0 fish
7 lost weights
Looks like a bonefish with a mohawk
i hate it here in germany
is this a new hype?
more and more stores list these rods
I would store a kayak in my house/apartment if that meant I could go out on the water.
How you craft a fish trap from a ventilator
https://youtu.be/Ri0-1Uq4tN8?t=194 [Embed]
settled on expride 7' light for neds and keitechs
I found an empty turtle shell and it got me thinking... half the turtles you see could very well be older than you. They live a long time and the full-grown ones rarely get killed by anything other than alligators or humans. Why would you kill a turtle if you aren't gonna eat it? That nigga might have 30 years of life left.
I have two rods I use for spottys, my baitcaster is rated up to 3/4 oz and I throw 1/4 oz jig heads at the lightest and then I have my light spinning set up on a japanese aji rod that's rated up to 10g and I through .8g-10g jigheads and other ul stuff on.
Ah. Make me tempted to take my kayak out tmr morning in the bay. I planned to do that today but ended up being busy in the morning
Which hook shape is the best for barbless hooks? Does it even matter if you keep your line tight at all times?
You'll lose more fish regardless even if you keep your line tight. It might be a loss you are willing to make though
I've been researching fly rods and I've got a few options to consider
What do you think I should get?
eagle claw or echo
Going to Cabo on vacation, going to have plenty of time to fish. The only rod I’ll be able to travel with is a 6’6” ML 5 piece though. I’m bringing some soft plastic swimbaits and jerkbaits, a few small spinnerbaits and hard bodied jerkbaits. I have zero experience surf fishing, what am I in for
It depends more on what type of fly you're tying than it being barbless. That hook you posted is good for beaded nymphs
I finally got a nymphing dedicated rig so I can be twice as effective on the river, also got a lot of other new gear over the off season im excited to try with opener coming up
I have a ML 1/8-1/2oz spinning set up and MH 1/4-1oz for baitcaster. Should be good enough to cover my shorepounding needs.
It was really nice out but the wind did pick up in the later morning.
If everybody of water in my county as listed as "do not eat the fish" due to industrial poisoning, will any man-made pond with drainage get poisoned in a flood?
Honestly it depends I mean I'd rather use a 4-8 foot monofilament leader and my main line be Braided. Just depends on what I'm fishing for. On my 50 wide conventional reel I've got 200lb power pro Braided line with a 130lb monofilament topshot at 200 yards but I think next time I might think about going heavy monofilament on the whole reel.
I would assume, and don't take my word for this, that by "poisoned" they mean acumulation of heavy metals in the fish, what kind of industry is it?
Just found out a good fishing friend of mine passed away recently. Really fucking bummed out about that. I told him my exact locations where I caught bass, we shared with each other the bass behavior at a local city urban park we fished together, and discussed lure techniques. I was a gigantic jig fisherman while he was a crankbait and lipless trap guy, baits I never liked to throw because trebles scared me. 
He laughed at me when I transitioned to swimbaits, telling me if tiny trebles scare me, how the hell doesn't 2 big 1/0 trebles. Shared with him my cast to catch footage, only showing it to like ~4 people at most because I didn't want to share my spots. Going to miss that guy, RIP good friend. One of the few I could tell everything too and didn't have to worry about it going out.
Maybe catching some baby stuff in the morning spoons are pretty versatile in baja. Cabo surf fishing is usually a 9'+ rod and 20lb line minimum. I micro fish a little in la paz, but most beaches in Cabo have big sketchy shore breaks.
Are ugly stik rods actually that bad? I was gonna buy one for inshore, but as I'm trying to do more lure fishing I'm worried about the no sensitivity meme. Is it exaggerated, or are they legitimate broomsticks, even the elite/inshore select models I'm looking at? How would they compare to a similarly priced reputable rod, like the Marathon Guardian. I would forget about the ugly stiks if my rods weren't forced to be stored in a closet and transported by renting on top of the console along the length of my sedan.
There is nothing wrong with them if you realize what they are designed for and the shortcomings. They ARE way less sensitive. They are more noodley at the tip. That's what makes them durable though. You can high stick them and they won't break. I've put one literally into my ceiling fan and nothing happened. I have a friend who treats his gear like shit, throwing it and all, and his hasn't broke. With that said... it doesn't mean that other rods "break easily." Most are plenty durable unless you treat your rod like shit, throwing it down, slamming it in car doors, trying to yeet snags in trees loose, and high sticking. If you are using mono, the sensitivity difference isn't noticed as drastically because the stretch takes away a lot of the feeling, but even on cheap line like Yo-Zuri Hybrid you will feel a difference. You will literally feel your bait touching bottom on most decent rods. Again... not really as important with baits that you constantly retrieve, but on ones that require a hookset it's a huge difference, almot needed. The Ugly Stik Elite is supposedly just a GX2 with higher percentage of graphite, but they don't feel a whole lot different when you use them back to back.
I'm using 15lb x8 spiderwire with a mono leader. Should I avoid the mono? Or is just the leader not a big deal? Also what rods do you recommend?
It's not as bad of a sensitivity loss as full mono, but obviously you still get some stretch and loss with mono leader. You can switch to Yo-Zuri Hybrid or a pure flouro and gain some sensitivity. As for rods... there are a lot honestly. It really depends on the budget, $100-150 being a sweet spot in my opinion. There are good $60-75 rods too, they just usually have guides that aren't as high-tier and less options on power/action. The $100+ rods also often come with good warranties. For example with a TFO rod, they will supposedly replace it if you break it for about half the price of a new one. If they honor that it's an extremely good deal honestly. I have a Professional model and I love it. I use it as a "do-it-all" rod and it really excells at that role. It's not a technique specific rod, but that's the allure. I'm actually planning to get another model in that line I like it so much. It feels really solid too if you're worried about something feeling fragile. Everything from the guides to the blank feel like you would really have to do something stupid to break it. It just has a really robust feeling without feeling like a stiff lifeless rod.
Link? Sounds cool. I wonder if you need to keep proof of purchase or something
after looking again, it says if it fails due to defect... but they do offer a repair service. I could have sworn it used to be what I typed earlier, maybe it did. either way, these rods are built very well.
I have the Medium Light and plan on buying the Light. A lot of people use the Medium for inshore.
have 2 for my loaners, work great for bobber fishing and basic lures so my friends can have fun too
and it's cheaper with shipping at TackleWarehouse
enjoy getting your stuff in 2 months
haven't used TFO before but Dobyn's has a great warranty system as well
Really? I thought people liked TackleWarehouse. I ordered mine from TackleDirect and got in in 3 days with the standard shipping. I'm 500 miles away too.
i love their selection but their shipping is absolutely atrocious
You sure it wasn't stock shipping from a third party vendor instead of their warehouse stock? That causes additional lead times.
shouldn't have been
was going to try omnia but their 10% off coupon won't work on shit i actually need
If you live in California, the tacklewarehouse shipping is godlike
Idk how it is if you live somewhere else though
i mostly use copoly but do have mono on a reel just for general purpose stuff
in general, not a fan of braid, just run 100% fouro (either red label or advanced)
What makes you suggest those over the others?
Echo is a solid rod with a moderate fast action and a decent reel spooled with good line for a reasonable price and a great warranty. It's a rod you may not even grow out of, and even if you do it'll still make a good backup rod.
The eagle claw is cheap and being fiberglass it will have a medium or maybe even slower action which is good for beginners because it gives more 'feel' and time for you to get set up between back cast and forward cast. An eagle claw was my first fly rod. I'm sure the others are decent but I don't have any first hand experience with them to say if they're good or bad.
Why the fuck aren't lake trout biting, I was told rain was great, I was told my hooks are the right size and I was told shrimp scent and plastic worms or trout dough worked fine so I have to be doing something wrong. I use fluorocarbon leaders so I doubt they're seeing my line. Give me retard tips please, I have to be fucking up something major. I could get these bastards when I was a child, how have I fallen this far
I've gotten one six inch rainbow this year and nothing else
They were biting on streamers this morning. Shooting stink tips from shore near a dropoff.
Thanks for the advice. Both of those sound great and I'll have to think a while about what I'm gonna settle on buying. 
Another semi related question, how necessary is a net and waders for fly fishing?
A net I could consider vital for fly fishing for trout unless everything you hook is gonna be super little, or you’re gonna eat them all. It’s not like it’s impossible to C&amp;R good trout without a net, but it can be a challenge and it’s a pointless challenge.
Waders are about your tolerance for spending time standing in cold rushing water vs your desire to stick it out. I’ve gone waderless in spring and glacial flows and I’d call it doable, but my friends called me Otzi after I fished the Stillwater River in May without waders (after mine tore and I didn’t wanna pay baitshop premium prices for ones that didn’t fit me) for a couple days in 2021, because no one agrees with me.
waders
only need them for cold water, in the warm you can just wet wade which is what i do in late spring to early fall
thats a tough call. i usually dont bother with a net, i can usually just grab my fish or if im planning on eating the fish i just beach them. but then some people wont go fishing without a net. if you do get a net make sure its the rubber mesh, otherwise you could damage the slime coat and do more harm than good.
Alright thanks. I'll be sure to pick up a rubber meshed net but hold off on the waders until I'm certain I need them.
classic fly right there.
A couple are 2, several are 7.
Few are 3-5
Built like smeagol
Yea it's not that difficult bros go out and get one it's fun
why are her legs so thin but she has a cellulite ridden ass? Is this the effects of american cuisine?
try it with lighter weight lures and see what you think
was using a kvd 1.5 crankbait, it's already quite light. Not planning on using senkos or weightless on it anyways.
Caught my first ever 5+ lbs bass. I don't have a good estimate on the weight since I've never caught anything more than 1ish lbs but from picking it up in the net, it felt really heavy, maybe 7-8 lbs but that could be just me overestimating as fisherman do. It was extremely girthy compared to the next one I caught shortly after which would've been my largest bass catch if it wasn't for the first one today. For scale, my net is 16 inches long. Caught on a 6 wt fly rod with a size 8 brown wooly bugger. I'm astonished I didn't break off or break my pole, but patience and letting the drag scream seemed to pay off. I was shaking after landing it so had to post it here, thanks for reading my blog.
Pic of the 2nd bass I caught. Still took up most of the length of the net but less girthy and much lighter.
which online retailer has best shipping
The problem has never been casting distance, it is blowing up a spool from overrun. Traditional baitcasters don't have any brake technology and you have to manually do everything yourself.
You should put 30 bucks aside and buy a scale
they're all fine. most people just choose whichever has something on sale or ends up being the cheapest after shipping. I've ordered from most of the big ones.
Very happy. My homemade hobo reel got me about eight bites, and was able to land four bluegills/sunfish and this bass.
kek I thought it was your fish killing bat, nice catch though
Haha thanks, I did try using a bluegill for bait but he flew off the hook. Red wrigglers were used.
Kek I'm a dumbest I read bat as bait. Nope, hobo reel bro.
I have fished a lot of small largemouth and bluegills this past 2 months with a light rod. Also, fished a couple of trout all with no live baits.
My first rod was a 50 bucks walmart spinning combo, I just want to use it for saltwater.
Now I want to buy a medium rod, but I'm not sure whether to start learning a baitcaster or stay with spinning rods.
Also, do rods past 7ft really matter for distance or is it pointless to go past that.
I take it you meant freshwater. You can use the same combo for salt, just make sure to rinse it off after and don't dunk your reel.
go with a 7 foot medium fast spinner on a 2500 or 3000 reel and you're good to go for most applications
I was chucking around some kastmasters off a jetty, and had a few small fish hit. Sadly I snagged up in the rocks and lost all 3 of them. The section I’m at has no break though, I haven’t seen a single wave the entire time I’ve been here
Bluefin looking good on these reports
Are there any that can fit in a vest? That's all I normally carry when fishing.
I am just getting back into fishing after being off for roughly 15 years. My only experience is catching Speckled Trout in NS with just a worm and hook.
Now I live in Southern Ontario along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence. I am forced to bank fish for the time being and not having a lot of luck, only having caught 2 smaller pikes in the Fall. I'm driving around my area to spot any bodies of water I can fish off of, still no luck. Any pointers on what I should look out for that indicates a good spot?
Also, there are some docks in town that I am considering trying to do some jigging from for Walleye, they depth is roughly 20-30ft but I'm wondering if they would even hang out around there.
Most of them will fit I think I know I can put my googan squad One in my pocket I wouldn't suggest that 1 though because it is not waterproof
Post What's in your your tackle Box
What I’ve been throwing lately.
Caught 2 smallies today, both same sizes at 20”, a 4 and a 3.8 pounder.
Awww hell yea!
what am I doing wrong bros?
Bass are starting to spawn try wearing something sexy, knee high socks, short skirt, midriff, etc.
Ya the mexicans love "cocodrillos" so I thought I'd mention them, but personally I prefer shore jigs with no treble hook and an assist hook on the front. Get a lot less snags that way. Either those or some kind of jerkbait or floating lure.
got my 1.5 day scheduled for May 22-23. Took the speed jigging pill and got it setup already.
where can we watch these films if they aren't coming to our city?
https://www.flyfilmfest.com/films/
Fuck the film fest. It’s always the same stupid bullshit that presents a wildly inaccurate picture of fly fishing.
It’s just assholes iterating on the ‘peaceful river runs through it’ meme.
Fly fishing is anything but that shit.
doesn't change the fact I want to watch them, running out of youtube fly fishing channels that aren't boring old boomers with a million sponsors (no idea who the hell watches this shit on youtube to be fair)
WildFly Productions are my favourite.
i went to the gas station and found a Penn Fierce II 8000 stuck to the butt of a broken rod next to a trash can. the handle was screwed too far out to catch the gears or make the rail spin, and it was full of sand, but its perfectly functional otherwise. theres no real reason to keep it because i have my own gear already, but itll be nice to sell it for some extra cash.
bless people who cant fix their own shit.
bass x vs. mojo bass vs. premier
confused by the price points considering mojo bass has better graphite than premier
Nice!
some hot water, a toothbrush, new grease, and about 250 yards of trashed mono later it works like new. i cant hear any sand in it at all so i guess i got every important part. theres some scuffs on it which is to be expected from a used reel, but this thing feels almost new.
Full grip vs split grip, Made in USA vs Made in Mexico, marketing, who knows.
I caught a 60lb bluefin on a torium 20 that I found on the bottome while spearfishing.
is there some way to compare guide insert material type
I caught my first striper on a fluke I found while putting in my kayak
I know these a meant to stop Pike from snapping your line but is there any big downsides from just leaving them on at all times for any fish?
Why I don't fish with live bait
do I go tacticool or a regular ass fanny
I remember watching some gay short film about some guy from Duluth who was racist but now he fly fishes and isn't racist anymore or some shit like that. Fuckin fag
maximum tacticool with the most flamboyant color available
is there a good reel comparison site
need to decide between miravel, stradic and vanford
ABU
you'd be surprised how often people do this when finesse fishing. it's always an unnecessarily large hook too with a big barb so you can't work it loose.
I intentionally bought a shallow two compartment basic pack because my emphasis was on minimalism and light weight. tacticool or big multipouch ones are good if you want to carry a lot of shit though. another hack is that you could buy a cheap "battle belt" and have modularity for different outings. pieces can add up though, even if it's noname chinese stuff. the Jansport Waisted pack fits one 3500 in the main compartment with enough room to cram some other stuff in there like soft plastic packs or relatively thin stuff, and the small compartment is perfect for your phone, a smaller tackle box, or random things about the size of your hand. the patch on the front allows you to thread excess strap through it and hang stuff with a carabiner, or just use paracord. you could also use paracord to hang stuff from the zippers too. I just like that even when it's fully loaded down it only sticks a few inches off the front, you don't feel like you have a shelf hanging off of you.
 Miravel
coreprotect
ci4 body
 Stradic
x-protect
metal body
x-protect
ci4 body
those are the main differences, search the difference between coreprotect and x-protect, but both the stradic and vanford have much more than the miravel. think of the miravel as a "top of the line basicish reel." it's nice, but the other two are much higher tier. if you're fishing only freshwater, even the Sahara FJ is the cheapest model that is "premium feeling."
The bigger the hook the less likely it is to swallow it. And worm books are easily removed due to the fold
Line-shy fish will be scared away by them
Sorry I got nervous and didn't know what to do
I ended up getting some chinkshit for $12. As long as it doesn't explode, I think it'll work out and force myself to downsize. My backpack was rougher on the shoulders than I last remembered.
decent sized largemouth can easily swallow large hooks. if you're late on the hookset and somehow the fish is still on, it's probably gut hooked. I've seen guys do it on several occasions with 3/0 and up. one guy probably killed his PB that was over 7lbs. he tried to pry the damn thing out for like 5 minutes before cutting the line and throwing it back.
this only happens with bait and soft plastics
AKA Finesse LMB presentations. Follow along Francis.
Don't really know that much, but if I wanted to go fishing in freshwater + florida intracoastal and inlets, would a Shimano SN2500FG reel be enough? Or should I go for the 4000? I don't know what the downside is of having the 4000 over the 2500
also, what kind of line would be best with said reel for general use in freshwater + saltwater. Right now I only have 8lb Trilene XL, do I need stronger line?
This happens when you focus on drinking beer rather keeping eye on your tackle.
why you fucking with aqua man
It's much less common with finesse metals, hard lures, and fleyes. The problem with most plastics is that they are impregnated with salt and scents so the even the most slackjaw of rubes can hook up.
Yes.
its gonna pair up with an expride for neds and keitechs, i'm just not sure the vanford is worth double the miravel
i've got a stradic on my wire bait setup which i love though
I prefer the thick fluoro musky leaders like:
https://sportsheadquarters.ca/collections/musky-leaders/products/stealth-tackle-fluorocarbon-leader
Not sure if it's accurate or not but I just feel more confident with the thick fluoro than i do wire leaders when switching up to target a different species.
Love my miravel will buy multiple more to replace old fuegos, sedonas and saharas. Are they vanford/stradic tier? No. Do you really need a stradic or vanford? probably not. It's an amazing reel for the pricepoint, don't think you'll find better at that cost to be fair. BG is around the same size but very heavy.
price*
most of my others are bg's and a nasci, just looking to make some upgrades here and there and i agree the bg's are fairly heavy by comparison
fucking foreigners
I'm very careful when fishing where people swim, but it's baffling sometimes how some people are actively trying to catch a hook.
i'm not, if they are outside of the designated area, its their own fucking fault
I would go with the 4000. the 2500 is still pretty damn compact. It would work, but would get stressed on big fish more than a 4000 would. If you wanted to spend a bit more, you could grab a Penn Pursuit IV 2500. They're bigger than Shimanos and much beefier for the size, have sealed bearings, and used as saltwater beater reels regularly because they hold up and can be maintained. You can buy replacement parts for cheap to repair them if need be. They are not as smooth feeling as even cheap Shimanos though. As for line, it really depends more on the types of lures/bait you intend to use and fish you're likely to come across. 8lb trilene xl is strong, but it's pretty thin so you gotta be careful about toothy fish. If you use your drag properly, large bass for example are no problem on that line though.
if it's for freshwater only I'd just save the money and go with the Miravel. It's only slightly heavier than the vanford and sometimes that honestly balanced the rod better anyways.
mexicans(often illegal) are always drowning in lakes because they don't stay in the swimming zones. I'd wager that besides them being drunk, a lot of them are probably getting hung up on fishing line snags. I get snagged on broken off wads of line pretty often so there is tons of it in there. The worst is heavy braid, that shit is like anchor rope. I've had to go neck deep in water with my knife to free my snagged lures on what seemed like 60lb braid. one more reason to hate bass fishermen.
Is top of the line gear from 10 years ago still good gear?
My Dad was a sort of legendary fisherman and owned tackle stores, we have carbon fibre daiwa rods and top of the line reels from about 10 years ago.
Are they still top of the game? Or has newer, cheaper gear surpassed what a 10 year old top of the line daiwa can do.
I was fly fishing too lol, IDGAF if the retard hooks himself but I do care about the fish he might've spooked.
Define cheaper
Sub $100 reel and rod won't surpass premium/flagship reel/rod from 1 or even 2 decades ago at $200-300 + price point. Many technology don't change that much and the fundamental design/material/precision quality still serve as the core for the quality of the tackle. Some cheap chink shit can try to copy and incorporate "new tech" from shimano or daiwa or w/e but if their main gears and frame are built with cheap material and have terrible construction/quality control, the reel would still be shitty.
Basically just wanted a gauge on how far fishing tackle technology has advanced in 10 or so years, and if whatever is inside a Stella reel from 10 years ago is now inside an entry level reel from Shimano.
I know how to fish but I don't know shit about the equipment I'm using.
I figure it's probably all about the same though really, I mean how overengineered can a spin reel get?
I would say a Stella from 10 years ago is still way way better than an entry level shimano reel.
based bass fisherman cleansing the nation of illegal mexicans
y tho
I slayed the spawning bass yesterday. Went through the beds with a plastic salamander and caught about 1/2 the bass. Going back tomorrow to do the same.
how do i catch crabs at the beach?
thx senpai, went with the miravel and yozuri hybrid
can't wait
Gay sex is the best way.
I guess I should have specified for me it's usually when I'm doing light line surf fishing at the beach. Aside from whether you're in a protected area there aren't designated areas for fishing or swimming. Every once in a while I'll get a nervous mom come up and say something, but nothing karen-y
Anyone ever throw flies for shad? What size streamers should I be throwing?
Do you have access to any salmon rivers on lake ontario? I think fish are running around this time in new york.
2010 Stella introduced x-ship, the Nasci which is Shimano's low-mid end basically has all the same features which is a $100 reel. The 2014 Stella introduced micromodule gearing, which you can find in the 2022 Vanford which is a $220 mid-range reel. 
Shimano's top of line baitcaster, the Antares, claim to fame was introducing the DC system in like ~2010 or some shit. That's trickled down into entry level low-mid end SLX baitcasting reels at ~$180. 
So basically, over the years, top of the line crap slowly trickles down, but it takes awhile. It still doesn't mean the reels are the same, Stella's, Calcutta Conquests, Antares, Steezs and Exists are going to feel buttery smooth for years from strict, strict quality control.
Being a bank fisherman with access to only park ponds is suffering
god i love eating theese mudbugs so much its unreal
I plow through a Shimano mid range reel in a year or two, after that its unfishable. For me, its the Daiwa Exist
I've not but Is something I want to do. I'd imagine small ones, like the #6-#10 ones people use for crappies.
it sucks
i live around a bunch of rich assholes with lakefront property and none of them fish and a total psychopaths about letting anyone near the shore to fish
https://www.decathlon.ca/en/p/8513030/fishing-float-tube-fltb-5-blue?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxYOiBhC9ARIsANiEIfaTYOGWULP8CvDUhnVUj21jv85SSWhu2yiQPKPdLbV6uhJgGE_lBvEaAm8BEALw_wcB
It's that easy.
nobody owns the water, get a float tube or even some waders, go to the public beach, etc. You can figure it out. I've seen aluminum boats on kijiji for like 150 bucks, as long as there's no leaks youre good. Just need paddles to row
Even if they leak, fixing them is not hard.
Freshwater you can own the water...Especially what sounds like a man made impoundment in a HOA.
they can't have a HOA if all their houses burn down
Modern problems require modern solutions
is xfast too much for a jig rod
5/16-7/16 at most
not setting the hook like a fucking clown
Finally caught a trout boys, he was alright but I messed up cooking him a little. Better luck next time
What color sunglasses should I buy, I researched and gray looks like it's an all weather it but so is green glasses?
I'm going to use it for freshwater and sometimes onshore fishing, also everyday use.
Green is probably best, but amber/beer bottle brown can work well too for those conditions. Clearer and deeper water, consider blue.
i keep green and blue with me, green gets the most use
Green mirror polarized sunglasses. Just caught my first carp on the fly today by sightcasting for him with some Oakley Halbrooks on with that kind of lens. Obviously don't need to cash out for Oakley's but that kind of lens works great for dirty ponds like the ones I fish. 
Pic related
I just use regular gray/black sunglasses. Just make sure they are polarized
i think you'll be fine though for small stuff i like a slower action rod, i think it casts small lures better
i hate fly fishing so much bros.
ive never tried it, looks overly complicated and it is usually associated with rich pricks here
My sincere condolences my friend.
blue/green lens never had an issue
get gud lmfao
i cant outskill the wind my friend
nothing wrong with a day of catching dinks
microcephalic take
I tried picking up fly fishing, but fly fishermen kept me from keeping up with it. You shoulda seen the look on the guy's face when I mentioned I ate calico bass.
I never get this. Bass bros will rage at you if you take fish even though it's legal and most bass ponds were stocked for food fish to begin with. I get looks, sometimes dirty sometimes perplexed, when they see my stringer of one pounders bucket mouths. Society can't stand seeing a fly guy eating good.
I mean I kind of get it with calicos, they're a relatively slow growing reef fish and they might not catch as many as they used to. I spearfish though and there are a lot more of them out there than people think, but they're pressured pretty hard here in socal and they're really smart and cautious for a fish. There's just a lot overlap between lmb guys and calico guys and they want trophy fish that they can catch.
Why would they do this?
Thought I got lucky and got a free stowaway, but it turns out I accidentally ordered two.
i don't really understand it either
to me, bass don't taste that great but i don't take issue if someone keeps a few pounders either
Yea calico is not so different than rock fishes and people are much more wasteful with rock fishes. They taste similiar too.
I don't keep most calico I catch though, even if they are legal size. I only keep them once in a while
Lol ya, rockfish are way slower growing than calicos. Iirc the oldest recorded calico was like 35 and some of those big reds are almost 60 years old. Personally I never take more than 2 calicos at a time.
I don't like to keep more fishes than how much I can prep right away for the day. Of course, people who pay $70-$200 to get on boats for will try to limit out on their fish take.
Anyone got tips for catching peacock bass? I have only gotten largemouth but I see peacock swimming around too.
Kek, ive been fighting the local Castle guards near the lake about this shit for years, i just take one singular step into the water and boom, i am now on public grounz and you can fuck off with the beaver hat and the guns
Do I bother fishing on the weekend?
its damn sure getting to be more and more of a hassle
not to mention fucking dock fees are outrageous
Caught some spawners today on the headwaters of the Missouri in MT. Been a good day lads.
Pulled this bad boy out of my lake this evening. Low and slow wacky rig action.
Haha, why? It's fun. Just ignore the culture around it.
Any recommendations on tackle trays for storing glides and bigger soft bodied swimbaits?
do you mean boxes? or a wearable tray for when you have waders on and standing in the water?
Its a Grayling. Mostly a euro and Arctic thing but there's one place in the lower 48 where the end of the Ice Age left a few behind too. Closely related to whitefish so still in the wider trout family.
glides
wraps are much better than tackle boxes / trays, can't beat the swimbait underground 9" or 12" wrap
If you don't want a wrap, can't beat a Plano 3731 or a Meiho 3043 (the big, open one with no dividers) 
I use a wrap for bank fishing and a meiho versus 3043 for when I just throw them in a big box at home.
Boys, shill me some rods. Gonna go fishing some more with my mom and brother this summer, need a decent quality rod. Nothing crazy, just a good rod for a semi amateur fisherman that is good quality. I'm willing to spend a bit.
what kind of fishing?
Trolling mostly
Caught this pretty fella today. Glad the rain finally stopped after a few months of there never being more than a 1 day break from it so the water is clearing up.
go to your local shop and buy the second cheapest starting kit they have
How much line does one really need for basic bitch shore fishing or river fishing? 150 yards enough?
depends on how big the fish is, how deep the water is, and how high off the water you are. But reel spools are designed to have a reasonable amount of line on them. You would only be under capacity if throwing a larger line then intended on a reel.
if you could move and buy property wherever you want in the us 
where would you move to live near a fishing paradise?
Tampa in Florida or New Orleans?
Just something I can throw my glides and bigger softbaits in to be it a backpack or shoulder bag
Thanks bro I’m really digging that wrap
If interested in salt water, last time I was in the Tampa area (Sarasota) the red tide was absolutely awful. Non-stop coughing at the beach because the air was more or less toxic, and the beaches were littered with dead fish everywhere. Not sure I would trust eating anything you catch there. Apparently red tide is just going to keep happening more and more frequently because of fertilizer use. The inshore freshwater fishing is fucking amazing though with tons of bodies of water. I have no experience with NO fishing.
I did some float fishing yesterday and I had a great time. I used to do this when I was a kid but then I moved to surf casting and spinning.
I love the simplicity of it, how minimal it is, feeling much more in control and the amount of focus required. Cheap as fuck too.
What do you think about this kind of fishing anons?
I only do it 2-3 times when the lure fishing season is closed here
i have the gear for it and ussually use it to introduce friends to fishing, one time i got lucky though, with a friend of mine and i swear they were taking down the bobbers as fast as we coul throw them in, this was like 7 years ago and my friends in now fully into the hobby
Lol where do live that has a season where fishing with lures isn't allowed but live bait is?
live bait is never allowed here, so it's bread or worms. Dead bait is also not allowed during closed season
this is the main type of fishing I do, I have caught just about every kind of fish on a float. It has a stigma of being for kids for some stupid reason. Float and fly is one of the most effective rigs for small streams. I catch gamefish in saltwater with casting eggs and casting bubbles. Use a jig under a float in all kinds of conditions. Use popping corks with lure trailers. And then of course you can always just have bait under a float.
The only two situations it sucks is in high winds and high swell (if you are trying to fish the bottom of the water column). Other than that can fish it in just about any situation.
mojo bass or sierra
Nice lad
Two, actually. They were historically present in Michigan, but that population went extinct in the 1930s due mostly to habitat degradation, leaving Montana with the only remaining native population. There are also stocked populations in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Arizona, but attempts to introduce them to various waterbodies in New England apparently failed.
There are currently efforts underway to restore the species to Michigan.
I never heard about them being reintroduced into other states, mind throwing me a link? Reminds me of the program to reintroduce Bull Trout to the Clackamas River. I heard it went pretty well so hopefully they'll do it in a few more rivers.
spinny thing
Bass are so stupid.
peacocks are actually large cichlids, no relation to bass surprisingly
seen a lot of videos of peacock bass smashing topwater baits, seems a go-to when fishing in the amazon.
will using a very small snap swivel interfere with using jigs/neds/keitechs?
The action will be fine but any weeds or algae you fish through will get stuck to your presentation more easily and be a bigger pain in the butt to remove. Just git gud at tying knots.
Post recent cops
I switched to fast snaps like picrel instead of snap swivels when I want to be able to change baits quick. They’re smaller and less noticeable and have less effect on the lures. They’re stronger too because they don’t rely on that little folded sheet of metal to hold everything together like old school snap swivels.
Remember to remove the piece of metal that you would typically tie your line to

Is it possible to /out/ without plastic?
t. plastic hater
100,000 years of humanity says yes.
Technically you don't even need a tent...unless it's going to be raining, it's just a false sense of security for our indoor centric modern lives.
Animal skins.
Yeah. But globally the mosquito population has increased madly. 
And as have the tick population.....
I use my tent to wake up without 5000 welts on my body, or having to spray myself down with agent pink.
Things will get heavy fast, but yes. Old US military surplus pup tents have no plastic. That also have no floor so you'll have to source a non-plastic tarp if you don't want to be on the ground. Surplus is probably a good avenue to get many non plastic items
it's expensive but there's still a few small companies that are producing gear with "traditional" materials. most of them are focused on winter activities since that's the one place natural fabrics are competitive with modern synthetics. if you are going down this route be prepared to spend money and at least double your pack weight. even if you get your camp gear and clothing plastic free though you are still going to end up with plastic headlamp or sunglasses or whatever so it's kind of an exercise in futility unless you are going full native. 
can look at stuff like:
wintergreen northern wear
empire wool 
filson
weatherwool emphasizes usa made, but their buttons may be plastic i guess,anyways, their wool is comfier than empire and filson, pendleton too (though their westerleys are fuckin cozy)

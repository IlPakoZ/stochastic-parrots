Turns out you can buy land in colorado for 1000 bucks an acre.
We could farm in the summer and drive semi trucks in the winters for income
Land is getting cheaper for those that have cash. 
If we all bought 5 acre lots in this huge subdivision , we could be far enough away from each other that we have our own space while still being able to do barn raisings and such 
Should we finally just do this?
If you could grow anything on that land, it wouldn't be $1000 an acre. There's a reason its fucking worthless. For that price, it isn't going to have any water and also isn't going to berth a fuck for ranching.
Ok so graze sheep instead
have a little creativity
Where can I buy land for $1,000 an acre? I'll take my tax refund and go buy an acre to live on
Stop expecting others to jerk your escapist fantasy dicklette for you.
And with a little planning and forethought we can be like all those other assholes that buy up all the access to public lands and make them our own private playground.
Wait we are bringing back this post? I still remember when these threads got spammed on /out/ every week and they all got laughed off the board. I'm kind of down with old-school shitposting.
Someone sounds upset :(
lol.
go ahead and buy land in colorado's high desert. you can park a trailer there and freeze and maybe have a sheep or grow cabbage in the summer
/out is 98% escapist circlejerking
look at northwest front or the other bullshit people are looking to do in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana.
Colorado is priced out.
We get it anon, you learned what maladaptive daydreaming is. you don’t have to keep uploading the same picture in every single thread.
Do you know where you are?
There be tweekers out there
with that low of a price, there's a reason. They're usually meant for you to camp on to hunt as far as I'm aware. Probably no access to water or power, so you're going to need to drill for water access just to have a well, you're going to need a well house and a pump and everything, but for that you need power. You're probably going to be way too far out to gain access unless you buy a bunch of solar. Okay, so you need the paneling to power not only your house, but your water pump as well. You need the storage bank for the solar, and with how little it rains you're going to need a lot of solar for not just to power the house and the water pump, but now you have to use irrigation for your crops. If I were you, I'd just get something a little less out in BFE because it'd end up being just as much. not to mention if you don't choose to drill a well, and go with water delivery instead, you're going to need a lot for not only whoever's living with you but for your crops as well, livestock, whatever.
A buddy of mine did this 3 years ago. Bought an acre for a few thou outside of Moffat in the San Louis Valley. He parked a school bus on it and lived like a refugee, hauling water from 5 miles away, driving 20 miles into Salida to get groceries from Walmart. He finally realized the error of his ways and sold everything at a loss. Colorado is full of these stories. Unless you have the money to build a house (even if it's a shack) and outfit it with a large enough solar system to run a well (which averages $10k to dig) and keep a vehicle maintained (and have the money to buy another vehicle when that one dies) and pay the property tax and buy food and pay for random medical expenses and buy everything else you need as time goes by, this particular lifestyle is a slow drain on your finances and mental health. I have the cash to buy 5 or 10 acres of land in BFE but after adding up everything I'll need over the years I know it'll kill me in the end. Unfortunately it takes some kind of income to live, and scratching it out on hardscrabble won't work. I've lived in some remote parts of Colorado in log cabins, trailers, and assorted tents and teepees, but the only way I could do it is by working my ass off on various construction jobs or at resorts, which meant having a 4wd vehicle in good shape. "Living the dream" is a euphemism for busting your ass in order to live in the mountains. It's a young man's lifestyle and unless you start a business you'll end up broke.
Is this the MGTOW commune guy again?
shocked at the smount of people ITT who don't live on well and septic
Lol Carbondale the extra bitch ass zone.
I cashed in for comfy towne life. Saul gud, no more bucking and splitting firewood or paying to have my end of the road plowed.
Collab with /diy/ and make aquaponics Setup
From scraps
We could also get starlink and work remotely when not growing dopes in the greenhouse
1000 bucks an acre!
what am i, a millionaire?

i have lots of relatives living in shacks and trailers in the bush 
and they invested very little in their land
they are geniuses of cheapness though 
equipment operators and truck drivers can make 35 bucks an hour during harvest in my area
they work really hard for a couple months a year and clear 20k
maybe pick up a few jobs off season
pretty sweet life really
the only downside i can see is that youll never get laid
Is it really worth all the fuss to get laid? 
Especially in Australia ? your women are nearly as bad as english women 
I would rather have a garden in the bush like weedy
you've never heard of a hand pump well? their possible out here in the wet east. theres even hand dug wells, as opposed to drilled wells that access the water table.
https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/County-Road-U-Saguache-CO-81149/2094366892_zpid/
Just need 31 other anons
Damn I just checked out the area and its all pivot farming , must be decent water 
Also look how close it is to the great sand dunes
Plenty of out stuff to do
Endless hiking and mountain biking
Why so obsessed with electricity? Our ancestors lived without it for literal thousands of years and they were able to make it.
5 acres isn't that much land.
Only good for shallow wells. Works to about 20'. Deeper than that needs a pump at the bottom of the well.
"hey guys I'm lonely and can't get pussy, plz come live by me, land is cheap and we can snuggle in a truck in the winter if you come by me, plzzzz" thread
electricity is nice, 12v solar is cheap if just running led lights and charging devices. it's cheaper long term than buying fuel or candles for lighting. optionally electricity for internet or even a 12 v fridge. etc.
there's the $2200 one or just get a 12vdc solar system and we'll pump for potentially less money 
old school windmill pump and water tower?
Solar is pretty cheap these days
Used panels go for like five cents a watt
Everyone is upgrading batteries so used ones are cheap as well 
A well pump does not use that much electricity anyway and can be run only in the daytime
Southern Colorado is probably the best place for solar in the united states with 3oo days of sunshine but it does not get very hot 
Passive solar homes only need heat on cloudy days and that can be done with a wood stove 
In the winter there is a trucking company that will hire us for 1500 dollars a week each, but we need CDLs and will only be home one day a week during that time

Id be done for it, though one of you homos would have to marry me so that i can get into the US.
At 5 acres apart you’d still regular see each other. That’s not as much as you think it is.
"Maladaptive daydreaming (MD) defines excessive use of fantasy which replaces human interaction and/or interferes with academic, interpersonal, or vocational functioning. This study tests psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Maladaptive Daydreaming "
so if it's interpersonal, and productive toward the self, as such is my relationship with God and my dreams respectively, it isn't maladaptive, but, I think you're just sort of a nihilist about starting over cause you know the owner of the world is satan, BUT, remember the Love between you and God, and then the love between others, that is why you are in this world. That's it. The rest is satan, and iniquity. (not saying I'm good at practicing this either). Plus, it does say, take care of the land, so, whatever land or community you're in, take care of it.
You people do not understand that like. . . Egypt and Central Africa are more livable than inland Australia. It is a desert like no other, and it is massive. It is easily possible to be 100 miles from the nearest litre of water. There is no "gardening"
Just join one that’s already established.

Ok smart guy, then why are the females so ugly while the men are above average attractiveness ?
Who can thrive in a society like that?
How do you maintain the drive to excel when there are no attractive women to impress?

You mean in Westcliffe ?
Just got through reading about the tenacious unicorn ranch 
That is some funny fucking shit right there, the townsfolk are at their wits end!

There are plots of land in northern Ontario and parts of Cape Breton Island for 600-700/acre.
But dont you guys have that giant armour plate or whatever that fucks up the soil?
You still need the well drilled, casing installed, etc. You arent hand drilling 100' of bedrock. Shallow wells access the water on top of bedrock, and really only work in certain soils, mainly sand.
Windmills are still shallow wells. 
Point is you cant assume its going to work. I have the correct soil and terrain on my land but the sandpoint hits bedrock before water. Make sure you have a backup plan like a spring, a river, or enough rain.
Can this issue not be redemied by building raised gardens? That's what I'd do.
Fuck, I am retarded. Remedied.
anon is wrong that nothing grows there
the zillow property that anon posted was 160 with water and next to tons of pivot fields 
Thousand dollars an acre and looks like alfalfa everywhere
That feeds a lot of lambs
At least make your lines parallel to the latitude lines next time
no
100 miles in any direction from anchorage and you are in the middle of nowhere
if people are going to live close they could split the cost of drilling a well, a small solar system with pump and a water tower 
being next to water would be best especially if it can be fished, water but a turbine for power and a rampump to get the water up into storage
a spring would be good to if it's potable
and a starlink
the... Canadian Shield? 
Yeah. But not on Cape Breton, and not in much of what counts as "Northern" Ontario. Northern Ontario starts at like Timmins.
I can't imagine how fucking annoying it would be to live next to a bunch of poor, useless, autistic, neets.
Why are you on this board at all if you have such a poor opinion of the people here?
Might be trying to bring back the old quality of this board instead of this new dogshit you guys have going on.
You know these commune threads have been here since day dot right?
In fact, this thread is a throwback to what /out/ used to be
The Better Bachelor guy on yourtube is setting up a place like this in montana
Its just going to be camping at first with a game room and a shower/sauna/jacuzzi setup but he plans on building cabins and such
I think the first wave up there this summer will be vanlife guys 
I plan on checking it out on my summer road trip. Will report back
Pivot fields are often very deep wells and have a tendency to lower the water table requiring home owners to drill even deeper. Check the water table and well depths in the area you are buying.
Thats true, as long as you trust the guy who has it on his land not to cut you off. People get weird' so best to plan for the worst and hope for the best.
Solar isnt that expensive, if you watch your power usage. I get by on about 20 amp hours a week. 400 watts of solar is plenty for me in WI. I have a little generator I can run for an hour to charge my system if it rains for a week.
Southern colorado has a weird system where they constantly recharge the area with irrigation canals so that the pivots wells are constantly getting fresh water 
Someone tried to explain it to me but it didnt seem right
All watersheds rely on snowpack and runoff 
But the san luis valley has irrigation from the rio grande as well
THIS
Why does every faggot on /out/ need to either be talked into going through with their dreams, or need a group to all hold hands together... Dick Proenneke and Forest Anon never had to post threads asking people to link up and help them. They just fucking went off and did their own shit without giving a fuck.
We want to have a community , if we dont talk about in places like this , we cant get it going
If this process annoys you , then hide the thread
Then why does OP have a fucking picture of Dick Proenneke if you guys are all gay commune hippies?
Living in a place with like minded individuals doesn’t automatically equate to a hippy commune, anon. In fact, I’d guess you’ve never been anywhere rural considering community is all they have out there.
I think Dick would have endorsed our efforts
Well Dick Prenneke and Forest Anon are symbols like Ted and others. They represent alternative /out/ lifestyles. Regardless of what they actually believe they are mascots for other people like homesteaders, peppers, survivalists, neoluddites, tramps, nomads etc. So it's always been appropriate to use their image for threads, even if the threads aren't strictly about mountain man individualists
Yeah true. Alright fair enough then
I must have missed this one
hes that guy with the beard the feds went after. lives in a forest shack feeding bears and taming mice
Your mind is infected with memes.
Sudbury.
Back in the day we had a single commune thread. Now we get to have 15-20 commune threads a week.
If you're serious about the idea, go camp there for free for a week or two and see if you like it. There are also a lot of druggies and rapists out there hiding from the law. 
A better plan might be to save up for a fown payment on a cheap fixer cabin that already has well and septic, then go HAM with all of your off grid stuff. Cheaper in the long run that developing frozen desert land from scratch
Did you mean to type one or two a year?

sorry son, all commune threads are equally faggy.
Do you see any other commune threads up now?
Maybe he will lead us to the promise land
Lived in cape breton for a bit, quite beautiful, ALOT of natives and reservations though and a huge chunk of the people are ugly as fuck
So that'll make me a solid 6/10 by comparison
As long as it's a tontine arrangement.
Its probably going to be one guy buying all the land then illegal structures being built by individual anons
Can you grow crops on it?
No because of the giant armor plate

You don't know jack shit about sheep
You have never been to mexico 
goats and sheep graze on desert with very little plant life
Yeah I know that, but that takes a lot of land. More than you can afford and certainly more than a couple of acres
I just looked it up and a acre of land is two fifths of a hectare. that is a miniscule amount of grass in a fertile area and in a semi-desert it's nothing.
You're delusional. get a job or change jobs, but don't come on 4channel to larp we're trying to help you here
I've done the math on this and am actively planning to live the /out/ escapist LARP. 600,000 USD is the number. You're going to pay way more 1000 an acre for land that you can homestead with. Way more.
40 acres of land thats a combo of trees, water, flatland for buildings above floodzones, and grazing pasture. Acquired for 320,000 in 2020. It has a cabin, well, outhouse and I've added makeshift solar. Eventually I'll need to build roads in, build a barn, and build some kind of 4 season structure with real bathrooms, septic, a real solar battery setup or run grid power to it. That shit adds up very quickly.
Good news, land and home prices are going to drop like a rock in the coming months so if you've been saving your sheckles you'll have an opportunity coming up.
How said they were only getting one acre?
When land is a thousand bucks an acre you can get a few hundred acres
who not how
it's never the water that's a problem it's the water rights.
Well they have enough to run pivot farming so that means drilling a well for home use will be easy. This is not the case in much of the southwest.
If you have a home well on your property but no irrigation rights , you cant run a pivot , but you can run greenhouses with drip.
Many of these places dont even have water to steal
Looooool
Everyone wants to go to colorado because its sunny 
Those other states are gray and rainy
when you buy land and want to keep it /out/ related its stupid to spread EVERYONE out like some boomer shit. you want everyone as dense as possible to save the nature part of the land.. and not have stupid wide tracks from dozers and heavy equipment moving about so people can live their homesteading fetish. 
I've worked on communes and with them. the best system is to build an apartment complex style building. However no matter what it's the most expensive part...
a 24 unit building [thats 24 different people] would cost [back in 2017 mind you gonna be way more now] 3.7Million USD.. thats 154,167 PER person. for an 800 sq.ft apartment. This doesn't include parking pavement. or what would be required by some states yearly fire inspections and shit like that. so now you need some sort of Tax.. or HOA fee... basically you cannot escape the everyday meme.
Best thing would be to pool your money with a few friends, those you can trust, buy an old hotel/motel/apartment/duplex/warehouse/industrial building. turn it into small livable spaces. and then all you have to do is worry about what state park/BLM land you're closest too.

How much did you pay?
Could you live there if you had to?
Right on, Cotopaxi is cool. At least the fishing's good, and it'll never be as populated as the rest of CO. I love the ruggedness of that area.
21k for 2.6 acre flat on top, flat on bottom, downhill valley cutting it. Wooded. Most stuff is flat field. 2 miles from blm. Can build a house, do a well, but no watering crops.

Sands Lake, just NW of downtown Salida. CPW stocks it with rainbows. I've only fly fished on the Arkansas and it seems a little fast for bobbers and bait.
There's no good land for that little bit of money. Land that's that cheap is not suitable for any kind of agriculture that can make you money. Obviously you can put cattle or sheep on any kind of land but if it won't support the animals you'll have to buy feed. If you want to garden or grow crops you'll never get it that cheap.

How remote are you willing to be?
Something that is at least less than 2 hours from a hardware/lumber store.

Probably an indistrial nursery for graft stock and dry rooted cane berries.
lol you have to be 18 to post here little kid
I don't think so, OP. Now get back to work.
anon this is what a lot of struggling farmers do to get by until their farms have matured 
Why do you think that seems underage to suggest ?
Bro this is just called being a redneck, I already live in rural America in Appalachia.
If you are moving onto land for agricultural development, you can actually get a subsidized loan like a VA loan, instead of getting ripped off by a bank.
It's because they want more people to move into the country and do agricultural development. This includes 97% of the USA, but over 80% of people live in concentrated urban or suburban regions. As a species, humanity is really just a blip of ant-like colonies surrounded by vast expanses of farms and wilderness, very caught up in its own self-importance.
It is called a USDA loan.
You can also lease pasture and cropland for under a hundred bucks an acre a year for agriculture. Pasture here is $24 an acre per year to lease, lot of people run their cattle and livestock on leased land, not everyone has thousands of acres. This is similar to how sharecropping worked.
Just any realtor site like Zillow. Then I look for the property on an app that shows where government land is like Gaia GPS or OnX.
These are the updated figures, used to be a few dollars cheaper, and you get a higher rate for irrigated cropland of course.
Why is there only mericans on /out/
Live under a leftist govt that knows what’s best for you. Worst thing I could imagine
Better off trying to reclaim Arizona,Maine, or New Hampshire.
I have a white wife and kids, all 120+ iq. I will do it if at least 25 other families are married and everyone is 100+ iq with no drugs.
It’s enough for everything except cows.
Yeah but will they be right wing social conservatives that believe in private property, self regulation, and not guilt tripping you about how they deserve your kids beets bc they lost track of time in the drum circle doesn’t mean they deserve to starve?
Most of us can’t afford it. All I wanted to do in life was be a heavy equipment operator or run an edible nursery. 
Instead I’m a fucking CPA to just pay for life and can’t afford anything else. If a coop farm system existed I could do it though.

/qtddtot/ - Questions that don’t deserve their own thread
previous:
has anyone here used the MLD circket tarp? im looking for a open tarp like shelter to use above treeline (1200-2500m), im deciding on either a mid style shelter or the MLD cricket since i dont know if an oversized A-frame tarp would be enough
not a big fan of standard tents i think they are too enclosed
Is there an oil I can use on a carbon steel blade as well as its leather sheath. No lard or fat--nothing that can go rancid.
I just acquired an old GP medium tent. I know some of you all probably have one and I'm missing some parts. I've got all the poles but none of the rope tiedowns. Previous owner said they rotted out and he never got around to replacing them. I was told I could use standard manila rope but I can't find what length or diameter it should be. Half inch and 15-20 feet a line?
Are the military surplus dog bone rope tensioners worth it? That's what it would have originally had.
Also, what kind of tent stakes are best for something like this? I was thinking of just getting some rebar and bending it into J shapes and going with that.
Is "cotton kills" a meme or not?
Should I throw out my entire wardrobe and replace it by wool? What are some recommended brands?
Is "cotton kills" a meme or not?
somewhat, cotton holds onto water extremely well so if you sweat a lot and the temperature starts dropping then it could put you in a bad situation, cotton is actually what you want to use in deserts though
for socks darntough are good and they have a lifetime warranty
consider not getting 100% merino baselayers because they will wear fast as opposed to a nylon and merino blend, polyester base layers are cheaper
perfect. I need experience for the southwest.
Im planning on visiting the US, precisely CA, NV, AZ and UT. visiting time around end of march.
about 15 days, starting at San Fransisco, ending in Las Vegas because international airports.
Thats should roughly sum up what I have in mind so far:
- San Fransisco (pier 39, ..., alcatraz ('NP#0'), hotel next to pacific ocean, golden gate bitch) 
- Muir Woods National Monument (NP#1)
- Yosemite (NP#2)
- Sequoia National Forest (NP#3, not sure if, probably not because time)
- Death Valley (NP#4)
- Las Vegas
- Hover dam
- Grand canyon (NP#5)
- Barringer meteor crater
- Drive to monument valley
- Drive to Canyonlands (NP#6, not sure if, probably not because time)
- Drive to 4 corners monument and back to Las Vegas (above Grand Canyon through Colorade City)
I am interested in any suggestions and tips.
I already know about the annual national park pass.
in general, I try to include as many sights as possible in the round trip.
we will travel with car and using hotels.
can provide any info on southern germany in exchange.
picrelated shows how I think of the 'outward' journey.
Why do some hikers import their GPX files to Alltrails and other sites for obvious established routes? Doing this makes sense for trailless routes that aren't obvious, but seems like a waste of space for well-marked paths.
What's a good hardshell backpack for traveling and hiking overseas? I need one (1) big backpack for everything that I don't have to worry about some mongrel cutting open.
Roughly how much money would a 5 day, 4 night guided gun cow elk hunt cost? Somewhere in wyoming, near the wind river range
if i have two 0C sleeping bags and stacked them together is there a way to estimate what temperature it would be for? one is a synthetic and the other is a down bag also.
Don't skip out on Sequoia! I personally would rather skip on DV (though I must admit, I hate the heat, so I may be a bit biased) over skipping Sequoia and KC, even just driving through and doing quick one or two hour hikes to the famous spots is worth it. Beautiful views!
For dead reckoning. Isn’t that obvious?
mh.
how much time would you estimate for driving into park, visiting general sherman and driving back?
is the seasoning around end of march ok for the park?
did you visit muir woods?
If you really just hop out at General Sherman, probably one to two hours. Depending on traffic. I was there around September, so no clue about the march. Right now, there's lot's of snow though. 
I haven't been to Muir yet, but the pictures look amazing. But to be honest, you could spend a year in California and not have seen everything, the Parks there are just phenomenal.
why will no one answer this question... I've asked knife makers and distributors and they ghost me instead of answering and the Google is useless on the matter.
because people that navigate using cellphones are retarded.
keep in mind sequoia national park (and kings canyon np) is different than sequoia national forest. also keep in mind some of those places require entrance reservations ahead of time
I don’t know that it will improve their rating or anything, it will just take longer to get cold. if you are out in weather below their ratings heat will eventually seep out. maybe it will be longer enough that it is effectively rating better
GORP
A general term for trail mix. Possibly an acronym for "Good Old Raisins and Peanuts," though there is much room for debate.
"Hey, pass the gorp! I'm starving over here!"
just use the same oil you use with the sheath if you like to oil it so much
you use youre knife every week and wipe it to jacket sleeve or pant leg after and before use anyways so the question itself is a null
when you come home you dry it out, sharpen it and oil it and then put it back in its sheath 
knife is not something to cherish its is a tool made for a purpose, youre not supposed make love to it youre supposed to use it
I don’t know that it will improve their rating or anything, it will just take longer to get cold.
dude
what do you think a warmer rated bag is? its just more insulation... if you have two down bags with 600g of down and combine them you will now have a bag with 1200g of down
What's a good way to get Febreeze smell out of a padded photo backpack? Stupid Goodwill Febreezes the shit out of everything...
How to make friends? More specifically, friends to do /out/ stuff with. I moved to a new city recently and am suddenly realizing that I don't know how to make friends in my 30s. The place I moved has a lot more /out/ opportunities than where I used to live, but I have no idea how to get started with things like climbing/mountaineering.
Join local Facebook groups. Good for finding people to do /out/ shit with, less good for finding actual friends if you're a 4chan autist, most people you'll meet that way will probably be your regular liberal mainstream outdoors types. Hunting/fishing groups and gun shops might be a good bet.
It sucks trying to make friends later in life, everyone I hang out with I basically met in college and I think that is the same for most adults. Most adults aren't looking for more friends because they feel like they already have a full schedule. (despite the fact that we live in a nation where people are offing themselves left and right due to loneliness, but I digress...) All I can tell you is to identify the types of people you want to meet and become friends with, then go to the types of places those people spend time (both online and physical) and spend time there talking to people, and hope some chemistry happens. Best of luck.
I use it several times a week and don't store it in the sheath. All the other tools that I own with leather sheaths are stainless so this isn't a problem. All the other carbon steel tools I own have canvas sheaths so also not a problem.
Which oil works for both leather sheath and carbon steel--you also didn't answer the question and your rambling has no relation to how the tool is used which isn't really relevant anyways to the question being asked.
You've also demonstrated the standard spam when googling the question--some retard gives a non answer and rambles about some totally unrelated retardation tangential to the question.
Linseed oil, I use it for all my tools and my work boots
I think any vegetable or animal based fats have the potential to become rancid but it sort of depends on things like heat and whether or not stabilizers are mixed with the fat. I've used various things like beeswax, mink oil, boiled linseed oil, and beef tallow to condition leather and I've not had any bad experiences. I always use mineral oil to protect steel because it's cheap and available and it works. I'd shy away from using petroleum distillates (other than mineral oil) on a knife blade because I wouldn't want to ingest potentially toxic stuff.
Thanks anon. I was going to try mineral oil for the sheath and blade and from what I understand the drawback is it softens the leather--which I don't care about at all. It's a machete for clearing invasive species on about 30+ acres of forest.and it's mostly game trails. I bought it because it was light and compact but still highly suited for how it is used. It won't ever be used to harvest or cut anything for food--it's for 100% murdering things like brambles and scotchbroom.
...isn't that for wood..? Everything I saw on linseed said don't use it on leather--except some people talk about using it on baseball gloves..
would anyone be interested in a /out/ cooking pastebin? theres only that one shitty picture spammed in most food threads here so i think it would be fun to post our recipes to add to it
I would pay for a camp-cook-book that wasn't total shit. Something that talks about meal dehydration and the shelf stability of packable ingredients. Bonus points if it has seasonal recipes.
Yeah though I wouldn't be able to really contribute anything to it
trusted brands for merino wool? Was a city guy but work just took me to the land of nature and I am trying to expand my horizons.
$10k has been the going price for a quality hunt for like 10 years. This will include lodging, food, and meat care (at least quartered and packed on ice). You'll be expected to tip your guide whether or not you're successful; more if you kill a trophy. You'll also be expected to help with the stock animals, field dressing the kill, and camp chores. Bring a nice bottle of bourbon for the guide.
10k for a meat hunt
yes, that's a budget price for poorfags that think they aren't low cast. hint: you're not upper class and there's not a chance in he'll a land owner in Idaho or Montana will tell you where the big game is.
My family has some of the largest elk and deer records in the world and you won't even come close.
Should I throw out my entire wardrobe and replace it by wool?
No. I mean if I had a bunch of disposable income then I might, but I still wear plenty of cotton for normal, non-/out/ activities. I do firmly believe that everyone deserves to wear non-cotton socks and underwear though. I'll never go back.
Thanks for the info. My buddy and I would like to give it a shot as a sort of bucket list thing. If we both shot cow elks, what percentage would you tip? 15%? If we get skunked should we tip like 5%?
What is the best way to set up a 10x10 or 12x10 tarp for shelter?
I like to put it off the ground a bit so I can be underneath it.
How do I get over indecision paralysis to actually pick a time and place to go on a hike? Never been innawoods solo before, so I've never had to plan the innawoods trip.
Also how do I cope with the risk of someone messing with my vehicle while I'm innawoods? Do I just accept that trailheads probably aren't popular homeless or meth head hangout spots, or convince a friend to drop me off at the trailhead?
and now after 4 days i reply to youre troll post yet again
Hell no. $200 for 2 cows is plenty. I'd tip a few hundred if my guide put me on a massive (for the area) bull. More than anything, your guide will respect you if you are quick to help with any chores and follow his instructions when stalking. BTW when I responded to your post I was giving you the price for a bull elk hunt; a cow hunt should be 25% to 50% cheaper. I know a good guide in Oregon who only charges $3000 for a cow hunt but your food and lodging are up to you to figure out. He'll pick you up at 4am at your motel and drive you onto private land to hunt all day. His success rate is excellent. So you should look into that kind of thing if you want to save money.
As a california desert rat, I highly suggest you pack as much water as humanly possible, long sleeves, lots of head cover, sunscreen, understand and recognize the symptoms of heat stroke, drink-that-water.
same poster, watch out for snakes, especially mojave greens.
do you have much experience with high-up arid areas? I'll be headed to Great Basin National park in the next few months. I know to take things slow, stack sun protection, and drink lots of water, but I'm wondering if there are any other things to look out for (aside from altitude).
if you see big horn sheep dont get too close, besides that, wear high top boots, loose rocks will rock your shit if you arent careful, but you should be fine if you take it slow like you said. Have fun, it is a beautiful place.
Thanks anon. I'm planning on getting in just as a new moon hits. I've never seen the night sky unmolested so it should be a trip to remember.
When will the rain stop? I want to leave muh tent. It's leeeeeking.
Asking about knife care is trolling
And just like the last time you posted--zero useful information.
any north americans gardening north of 58?
im obsessed with far north gardening. but i have no info
every time i see articles or videos about northern gardening it involves greenhouses or other high input methods
i image search northern communities and its all lawns and local trees
i thought it wasnt possible than i read about agafia lykova and her family
they grew rye, peas, potatoes and hemp seeds on the tiaga
they even made their own cloth out of hemp
bizarre that they never learned how to smoke hides though
planning trip to lake athabasca this fall
would like to distribute free seeds in return for free info
very active seed collector, hundreds of varieties
really excited about northern limits of field crops. winter cereals, mustard seed and sugar beets
also herbs and vegetables that can produce seed in a short season
Late, but if you are still here: Weather has been bad in California. You might have significant delays in getting were you want to, even later this month. Roads wash out in flooding, especially in Death Valley(which I think is closed because of this) as of writing, Yosemite is snowed in. Last time I was at Hoover dam, the tours were not operating. Look ahead of time before going. Meteor Crater and Monument Valley are usually accessible as long as no roads are closed. The drive on 89A towards Fredonia and Colorado City is great. Good luck and have fun.
The road you picked through Death Valley is open so it shouldn’t be a problem. Just keep your eye on the entire route and keep weather in mind.
I use mineral oil on a dagger I have plus leather scabbard. It's been six years and no appreciable damage to either, and it keeps the rust off just fine.
Can't speak to active duty knives, all mine are in nylon or kydex.
Any advice on finding other people to hike with who won't rape and murder me the second we're alone innawoods?
I remember watching a show on History Channel a few years ago where they are walking on, I believe, British peatland. The guide tells the host not to step in the random creeks because people get sucked under and never re-surface. Does anyone else remember this? And if so can anyone guide me to either the video or some sort of information on if it was peatland or moorland or a quagmire and what the phenomena happening was called?
Sounds like the Bolton Strid. If not, it's probably just generic tidal mud flat shit: get bogged down, get exhausted, suffer exposure, tide comes in, drown.
is it possible ans usefull to put hooks on a rope ladder like pic rel. I want to be able to throw it on position above me and make it hook in in order for me to get to elevated positions. Like throwing it on a ast of a tree and the climbing that. or throwing it inside of a window and then climbing that.
with these kind of hooks
Thank you, this was going to bother me until I found it. It is in fact the Bolton Strid.
Agreed, you want it to be like a grappling hook.
I might be a retard, but those look thin as fuck.
image from >>2553450 is clearly a largish fishing hook
you want a grappling hook, not a fish hook
desu a larger fish hook might even work, those things are strong, but it would be a very bad day if you accidentally hooked yourself or the dog with a fish hook.
will picrel spontaneously combust if stored in a ziplock bag inside of a dry bag at the bottom of my pack? It says "natural ingredients" but doesn't say anywhere if theres petroleum inside.
Enlightened Equipment has a chart but it's an estimation. You also assume the bags won't compress each other due to weight or fitting inside the other, which will effect the insulation, especially down.
Big ole DEPENDS. Pape hiker on the youstubes has a lot of suggestions. A frame covers most, but have a few options for high winds, more 360 protection, and for open field pitching depending on location and equipment.
No. You'll be fine
how much weight do you usually carry to your treks? I think I would like to go on like three day long hikes where I walk a lot around rocky countryside, but want to make sure i dont carry too much to ruin my trip.
Bring a gun
When you're in AZ, make sure to take a detour to drive on route 89A from Flagstaff to Sedona through the Coconino National Forest. Most beautiful goddamn drive I have ever been on, I think there are hiking trails you can stop at if you like but I didn't have time to check them out when I was there.
Is a sleeping pad for €30 like pic related good enough for a beginner like me? I want to go wildcamping for one night in the weekends. Also, is a 50L backpack big enough for one night camping trips?
Looks like a self-inflating mat, which should keep some/most of the rocks and roots from digging into your vertebrae. 50L is massive for an overnighter unless you're looking at really low temperatures and bring a very bulky sleep system.
50L is plenty for a weekend. i can easily do 3-4 nights out of my 48L bag assuming I can find water somewhere. im not familiar with that brand but im a believer that sleeping pads are one of the items you should not cheap out on. your comfort and warmth are heavily dependent on that pad. closed cell foam pads are the best budget pads you can get, indestructible, light, and have some insulation
I found a closed cell foam pad for €50 with R-value of 2. Should be good enough, right? When I have all my gear I'll measure the volume in litres needed for my first backpack.
Recommendations for a good budget lightweight cold-weather bag?
I'm trying to get more into /out/ shit, my gear is fine for camping but I tried to hike a few miles with it and it was really heavy. I got a scale and realized most of the problem is my sleeping bag is fuck heavy, it's a Walmart brand one. I'm still a poorfag but I need to upgrade that if I want real backpacking to be possible at all for me.
Why are ultra light fags so obsessed with weight? I would understand if you are thru hiking the PCT or something, but every time I meet these retards on the trail or at stores they are obsessed with spending a ton of money on gear that looks like its about to fall apart. Are you that weak of a twink that 4-6 lbs of extra gear makes it too hard to hike for a weekend? For example, my gear for sleeping is:
tent is 6 lbs 3 0z
sleeping pad is 40 oz
sleeping bag is 4lb 4 oz
I also am quite larger than most of the people I see on the trail (6'3 and 265 lbs) and I got a nice big agnes sleep system that actually lets me sleep comfortably with their super wide and big gear. My tent is a 3 person Kelty one so I have room in it for me and my dog as well as girls (female) whenever I convince them to go outside. I guess I just don't see the huge difference in 5lbs of total gear when half these people are cutting their tooth brush handles of and meticulously weighing all their gear.
Like many hobbies (I can confirm cookery, guns and photography) the insidious mind-virus of "improve number" gets its hooks into people.
True nirvana, the banishment of vulnerability, and mastery of the world is behind the next 30g saving/0.2s split time improvement/f-stop/BTU of burner output.
5 pounds of weight saved means I can take a 6 pack of tall boys with me. Or 3 tall boys and my fishing gear. Or no tall boys but my pack isn't as heavy when I lash my bow or rifle to it.
That is fair, I understand the autism of hobbies can creep in regardless of hobby type. Maybe just something about the gram counters gets me. John Muir hiked through mountains in a suit; I certainly get packing in a thought out and smart manner but at a certain point you are missing the whole point of the out doors-enjoying it requires almost nothing as it is our birth right
Yeah I also get that there has to be a point where if you save weight in X area you have more room for Y but if you are that heavy loaded you have to cut stuff for other superfluous things you probably aren't packing well to begin with
Gear fetishism is - and again this is true in many areas - a hobby all its own adjacent to the main hobby.
I know at least one gun owner who nearly never shoots his guns. I know a few /out/ types who spend at least as long packing as they do on the trip and once they're on the trip they don't unpack or use half the shit they brought. Not that they packed heavy, but they don't need things and actually start to engage with the natural world once they're there.
It's all just natural collect-and-polish behaviour that's been with humanity since the first shiny rock and will be with us until we have complete mastery of matter.
should work just fine down to freezing t. norwegian
if for some reason it isn't enough make a bed of spruce branches and put your roll on top
I'm going to be car camping and hiking at the end of the month around sedona, the nights might still dip down to the 30s. I have a shitty tent and a 20 degree sleeping bag, but I want to be toasty. My plan is to fill a couple hot water bottles to put in my sleeping bag (just disposable plastic type) and get some 10 hour hot hands packs. I'll have a few pairs of wool socks, thermal long johns, sweaters, and a beanie. Does this strike you as fine? How many hot hands do I want per night, assuming I'll probably start using them when the sun goes down and hanging around the camp fire (in the wind) till midnight? What's the strategy when using them, just put one down each sock and maybe one under an arm pit?
I currently work a tech job as a software developer, but I will need to find new work next month when my current project concludes. Are there any techy jobs that would get me out innawoods? Ever since I got out of college I've been wondering if there's a career out there that could mesh my appreciation of the outdoors with my affinity for tech.
teton sports makes budget 3 season bags. Leef i think is the cold one
Yes I have an orange silnylon one. It's a popular choice, along with the trail star, for camping in exposed places. The current version of the cricket does need a longer trekking pole, otherwise you need to use a pole jack which Ron will send with the tent. The silnylon version is more verstile than the DCF version as you can pitch the beak lower. I haven't had the chance to use it much yet but so far the few over nighters I've done with it have impressed me. 
If you go walking around the south west learn what cryptobiotic soil looks like and don't step on it. 
a gpx can be handy even for a trailed route, for example planning distances, checking elevation etc. also all trails and similar sites, iirc, crawl the internet and basically snap up publically available gpx files.
my gear weighs in at 6-8.5lbs depending on conditions, then add ~2lb per day for food, and ~2lb per liter how water. A three day load out in normalish 3 season conditions where I don't need to carry much water would weigh in at around ~12-15lbs
Why are ultra light f*gs so obsessed with weight?
I mean it's in the name, if you weren't obsessed with pack weight they wouldn't be ultralight... for a small light bag is more fun to hike with. There is a massive case of diminishing returns under ~9lbs imo. under that it's less about reducing weight and more about simplfying your gear list.
I met a guy who was living in his truck. He had solar panels and a star link connection. He works a tech job and was basically just cruising around the place setting up in a campsite for however long and working his normal hours. Seemed pretty cool.
basically just cruising around the place setting up in a campsite for however long and working his normal hours
Once upon a time I actually considered doing pretty much the same thing, but with a boat. I don't think I have the kind of money saved up to properly outfit a truck/van/boat for that sort of thing at the moment, but it's definitely something I'll consider going forward.
Awesome, this is exactly what I was hoping for. Have you used a lot of Teton gear, is it at least decent quality? Their site has good deals on other stuff besides sleeping bags, anything you recommend or anything I should steer clear of?
Remember my baseline here is milsurp, thrift store shit and Ozark Trail so even if it's awful compared to most modern brands it might still be a good step up for me
his setup didn't look cheap, but I got the impression his job was well paid.
I'm painfully fucking jealous of people who can pull that off. That has been my dream for years and I keep running into setbacks and bullshit. 4 years and thousands of dollars went down the drain trying to restore an old motorhome that was ultimately a lost cause.
That's the fucking rub. I'm running into the sad reality that everyone who makes this work nowadays has a bunch of money for nice equipment. You can't just pick up some old camper for a few grand, spend a summer fixing it up and then go cruising merrily around the US on a shoestring budget like it was fucking 1972 and I wish to hell I could go back.
He had this particular roof tent thing for his truck which he said he had to wait a good while to get hold of as they are in short supply but high demand. 
But desu the most expensive parts of his set up was the equipment to facilitate his digital work, solar panels, batteries, and star link. So if you didn't need that then it would be cheap. But the joy of the digital side is that you are working and living, rather than going on holiday.
On something of a related side note I worked with a guy who lived in a horse drawn wagon in his 20s and most of his 30s. He would travel up and down the UK doing small scale forestry work, using the cart horses to pull out the logs. He said he gave it up as the roads became harder to travel with horses due to more and faster car traffic. Plus attitudes towards him changed quickly. Areas that used to be welcoming, and even keep work aside for him, started to shun him. Eventually he said in some places were actively hostile. It's sad but everything changes, for the better and the worse. He said it took him a long time to get used to living in a house and he would basically spend all his time in his garden.
After I gave up on the motorhome I started a project building a ghetto camper cap for my truck. It's halfway done now, we'll see how it goes. My vision is like the redneck macgyver'd version of this guy. For now I plan to work from coffee shops and public libraries though Starlink might be in the future if I start traveling full time. The other big hurdle is getting my employer to move me to full time remote which has been "next year" for several years now. And my fucking coworkers keep going on vacation or catching the coof so I need to do onsite work to fill in for them.
Yeah, society is mostly changing for the worse in terms of living on the road for cheap. I feel like travelers are viewed with more suspicion now and police are more likely to hassle you. Modern RVs are made of fucking glue and cardboard and not designed to last at all, because the market is mostly boomers and retards who only use them for a week a year. The age of the wanderer making it day to day and living by his wits and skills is over, now your only practical choice is to jump in the rat race and kiss ass in a corporate hellhole job to earn a bunch of money, leaving you without enough time to really enjoy it anyway.
its not uncommon to see ultralighters out hiking
This has nothing to do with the argument made by the post you're replying to. Try reading it again.
That's all true but I think that anon was talking about people who take it to a ridiculous extreme. Dropping an extra couple hundred bucks on a high quality, ultralight tent or sleeping bag is sensible for people who can afford to (not me, I'm this anon >>2554334 who was asking about Teton Sports, but for some people). That guy was talking about people who are measuring everything down to the gram and cutting their toothbrush in half, and who are having a dick measuring contest over whose pack is lighter.
That's fine and it's good that they're driving innovation, but in person they still tend to be fucking insufferable pricks who give you the stink eye for not having the latest Gucci equipment
What are some fun things for toddlers to do while camping?
Raccoons are fun
Are the ultralighters in the room with you now?
its a meme, 
COTTON for HOT CONDITIONS, where you NEED to stay cool
WOOL for COLD CONDITIONS, where you NEED to stay WARM even when wet/sweaty, also prevents smells for a couple day to a week(then it turns into a wool bomb of smelly shit you yourself don't notice)
you will have 2 types of oil to use
FOOD GRADE OILS, that don't poison any vegetables, meat, leather/fur, and make breathing in smoke from a fire a bad idea. These will do the intended purpose of so-called knife oils, to prevent rust and to lubricate joints/pivots/etc.
Then there are the slightly, to very poisonous types. These are bad idea to use for anything you use for food, hunting, and surgery/cutting out ticks, splinters, etc. These are meant to be used for knives you are leaving in a supply cachet, like in a summer/winter home/cabin/bug out den/ emergency stash in your vehicle. These are meant to REALLY prevent rust, even if they get rained on/left in moist area's because the roof/cabinet/tackle box started leaking. Their main purpose is to prevent the knife/axe/tool from turning into rusted pile of rubble and to prevent it from being rusted shut/open and unusable. These you are expected to completely remove, replace with a light coating of something safe for you to use it to cook/clean with.
Most natural oil based types are safe for the first purpose. Not to drink/slather on your food. Synthetic can be food safe, but will generally have the same effect as antifreeze will on your body.
If you are the type to constantly oil your knives, guns, and tools. You will generally be safe to use the so-called fat types. Stop oiling everything up. Its meant to be used for tools you DON'T USE for long periods of time and/or wet weather.
these are just particle board bricks that have petroleum, wax, and/or scentless oils used to hold the finely ground wood particles together
DON'T store oil soaked RAGS in ANYTHING you don't want spontaneously starting on fire though. THAT is a true thing that occurs. Lots of thorough studies and science behind THAT.
Just make sure you don't drop a hot, recently used stove/lantern near them and you'll be fine.
the insulated mat, whether its inflatable, gram light, and/or comfortable is kinda a meme if its to keep you warm
just get a collapsible cot, weights almost nothing, doesn't take up space til you deploy it, Takes your ass off the ground, insulates you that way, and works in both hot/cold climates.
solid folding ones are only really usable if you have a permanent place for them because they take so much space up. a small fan for when its hot(folding solar pad to charge/run it during the heat with long cord) and to blow the fire-heat under it during the winter/cold
tarps are a meme if you aren't in closely wooded area's, otherwise they do make hot temp camping NICE, winter/cold camping you'll be looking to make wind breaks just to not freeze to death
That sounds like absolute overkill to be perfectly honest. Even a poor 20deg bag might be enough with the layers you described, maybe just a nalgene.
Camp cooking, firewood sorting, games by the lantern.
Fan
Cot (insulated???)
Tarps are a meme
Ngmi. But seriously cots also need insulation in cool weather. Same issue as hammocks, bottom is exposed to air.
what is a good flashlight for about $20-$30? preferably one with red light and SOS mode.

Thanks gang
So a lot of outies say that Merino Wool socks are a godsend. I can buy that, but I have a problem with, well, buying them. Almost every pair of socks I haven seen in stores (if it matters, I'm looking in outdoor specialty stores, not Walmart or Costco) that are advertised as Merino Wool are actually some kind of blend.
A) Do 100% Merino Wool socks exist?
B) If they don't, what is the bare minimum percentage that is acceptable? I've seen socks with as little as 20% Merino Wool, and some as high as 82%.
you will never find 100% merino wool because any decent sock will have spandex and nylon to give a proper fit. 80% merino wool constitutes the entire body of the sock
ime merino on its own is pretty fragile, the blends have all the pros of merino while being much harder wearing.
Any reccs for hiking pants for anons with sensory issues ( i favor loose n stretchy/jeans are a no go always). a friend told me about outdoorresearch but the price for their products is a bit steep for my pockets at the moment.
frogot pic. related item.
Running shorts in the summer, Prana stretch Zion if the weather is on the chilly side, long poly/lycra running pant (similar to bicycling pants) for colder weather. I have heavy poly/lycra long running pants that I wear in deep snow, they're warm, comfy, and dry fast.
Are there any good bottle to bladder conversation kits out there? Not mainly for PET bottle. I only find this Source on so far.
Recommended walkie-talkie?
Baofengs, right?
we have a problem in our yard, and we need to find out what is getting into an enclosed area, so we want to get a trail cam. 
kind of want a wifi enabled one so we don't have to go out to get data from it, but also don't want to pay out the ass for a cell enabled cam either. would like to have video but it doesnt need to be a priority, just a good image is enough, but seeing what its doing would be a nice extra, and when this is done, probably going to stick it to birdfeeders or where we don't care about will come onto out yard. 
we need decent night performance, and would like decent day performance. I have no idea where to even start looking at these things
50% wool is good. Any more and you will see faster wear.
Is there anything toxic or otherwise harmful about wading in dark iron-rich water, aside from maybe staining your clothes? Pic related, where I went today.
People might use it on baseball gloves because it's a little bit sticky. I only use it on wood and metal. Like a pick or shovel, just coat the whole thing.
Also how do I cope with the risk of someone messing with my vehicle while I'm innawoods?
Depending on the vibe of the place, sometimes I leave it unlocked with nothing valuable inside. Sometimes I leave a note in the window that says I'm hunting nearby... which is sometimes true.
looks more like tannin rich than iron to me, with iron you get those bright orange stains along the edge
either way I wouldn't worry about it
Who makes nice full brim hats? Polymer material if possible.
Look up cold frames. Lengthen your growing season by starting seedlings early.
When oils are exposed to air, they begin to polymerize and oxidize and give off heat. Buckets of oily rags catch on fire because oil + high surface area + thermal insulation of other rags around them.
No matter how strong you are, you can go farther and faster with a lighter pack and trekking poles.
Throw rocks in creeks.
Get lithium AAs if it's cold.
I'm going to do a three day, two nights hike soon and won't be going to any stores. 
I'll be bringing a tent and a sleeping mat. What kind of food should I bring. 
I should probably get something to filter water with and scout for a route near water shouldnt I? or is bringing 10l of water a realistic thing. I only ever did one nighters and was able to carry all my shit with me (water included). 
Is there anything else I should be aware of? I won't be doing a round trip if that is somehow relevant information.
is there a way to incorporate weight training into hiking? i'd like to get stronger upper body, but i don't really like gyms, so i was curious if it's possible to get a relatively good physique just by hiking? could I just carry a weighted backpack, and maybe weighted trekking poles and expect results?
Do the gay jogger thing and carry dumbbells in your hands. Honestly hiking is not great if you're trying to gain upper body strength, it will help you tone up a little but you will never get jacked doing it. Your best bet is to stop and do pullups from trees along the way with your backpack on desu
I should probably get something to filter water with and scout for a route near water shouldnt I?
Yes, that's way better. Bringing 10L of water would be fucking awful, people only do shit like that camping in the desert.
what kind of food should I bring
Light weight, calorie dense. Freeze dried meals are a great option, but they're fuck expensive. If you're on a budget, those Knorr brand meals in the green bags are like a dollar apiece, weigh nothing and taste okay. You will need a bunch of them though to keep your calories up for hiking. For breakfast, oatmeal is king. Pasta is good. Nuts and beef jerky are good trail snacks, very calorie dense. I always bring instant coffee as well, yes you can get a good pour over coffee setup for the trail if you're a snob but I'll stick to my shit tasting caffeine mud.
Other anon is correct, the knorr sides and some protein sources like spam, chicken, or fish make pretty good dinners. Depending on your weather, hard cheeses and sausage work well. Some peanut butter. And snacks. Lots of good snacks like the nuts and jerky. Apples and oranges pack well. Layout your food in a per day menu on the floor. Should be hitting your normal active calorie intake plus extra but that's all on the individual to decide. Snacks are good because you can always carry extras to fill in of the hunger hits. Oh and day 1 you can bring pretty much anything. I'll do a sandwich, hardboiled eggs, olives, whatever will last 10 hrs in a pack. Shit if you're building a fire night 1 you can bring a steak and potato.
less sodium spam
Thx
Why are Leathermans so more expensive in Europe than in US? For example, the Wave + is 119.95 USD, but 159.00 EUR.
Is there any simple way to pay for the american price and ship it to this shitty continent?
Buy a solid set of dumbbells to keep at home. So many exercises you can do with just dumbbells. Keep them somewhere available and just pump out some sets when you walk past. You'll learn to like it
Planning a proper trip this summer and need the essentials. 
MSR Elixir 1 tent, anyone familiar with it? Is it durable? And how big is the space outside really? It seems small, but it also seems like no alternatives have bigger.. Is it possible to use in winter too? How cold / how windy can it be used in?
Also looking at MSR XGK EX. Anyone familiar with this stove? I want to be able to cook my food without just burning it. Is it doable to cook the fish I catch? Or do I have to constantly take the pan off or make a stand to keep it high off the stove?
any 1 person tent is going to be small as fuck, just enough room for your sleeping pad and a bit of gear. personally I think MSR is overpriced for what you get.
the only real difference between a 3 season and 4 season tent is that a 4 season will have minimal mesh on the inner, probably just a couple vents on the top ends and thats it. the tent is just there to keep the wind and moisture away, the actual warmth is your clothing, pad and bag.
Ok, so at non-extreme temperatures like down to -10 celsius let's say, it's probably fine with 3 season?
yes
"4 season" tents are a marketing gimmick and universally suck ass. beginner trap/pitfall.
no single tent is good in all weather.
you want a 3 season tent.
and if you get into winter backpacking you need a dedicated winter tent. winter backpacking requires its own separate gear list and its a lot more expensive to get into. start with 3 season backpacking.
-10c
3 season tent is fine as long as there is not a large amount of snowfall. otherwise you will need a winter tent designed to support the weight of the snow pack. its less about the temperature and more about how much snow falls.
Ok, I see. Thanks, lads
Anyone wear full grain leather hiking boots like the Danner Mountain Lights or Limmer boots? There’s also the Merrell Wilderness but I read their quality went to shit. Anyone got reccs it’s hard to find much info on this everyone loves they’re fancy synthetic shit 
They’re pretty expensive but not really if you resole them. Not sure if the weight is that big an issue. I started working in the classic redwing Mocs and while brutal to break in they’re so comfy and supportive after a few weeks.
just tie a prussik to any light weight bearing rope. unless you are going larp mode so it has to be what was used you are making this way harder than it needs to be.
Yeah, I think I'll go with a SAK. Thanks!
...so that's what not to use
how about telling us what to use
Use a prussick on a tent stake tiedown.
no
just..no.
please never ever give advice on knots again
This isn't actually true.
I regularly speed check when walking with zero gear, day-pack and fully packed and the speed difference between day pack and multi day pack is negligible. Ultralight is a meme propagated by woman and weak vegans.
where do you live/hike? somewhere really flat? what sort of hill grades do you normally hike?
your post knee jerks as dumb as hell to me but i live in the mountains. i don't think it matters very much on flat ground either.
danner import boots are bad and danner mitusa boots are overpriced relative to quality. not a fan at all.
if you want a pacific northwest boot look more at jk, whites, nicks, wesco, viberg, etc. the quality jump is massive for not much price increase over danner made in usa.
be aware none of these brands use normal sizing and all have sizing quirks you need to research. they're bespoke made to order.
Trick question; he doesn’t hike at all.
Thanks. I actually have a pair of nicks logger style boots. But I don’t really want such a high boot for hiking. I’ve never seen shorter slightly more lightweight boots from these companies do you know of any?
I'd argue walking speed isn't a good metric. Miles per day median or average and median days on trail per week or something maybe. The weight reduction really shows when you're reaching 25+, 30+ mi days every day for weeks. Less weight is less effort, less energy expenditure, less likely to result in injury. That doesn't show on a weekend hike or mph.
Do you think a 23x30in (60x78cm) towel is enough when backpacking ? cutting it in half to this size would save me 100g, I'm wondering if I'd still be able to dry my whole body with it.
Take a shower and try to dry yourself with as little as possible maybe? Unless you're swimming, what's the use beyond wiping your feet or condensation?
that's true desu I dont really need much anyways lol thanks
You're an idiot and asking all the wrong questions. You're also weak if you don't understand that the larger the incline the less there is a speed difference based on weight.
Its amazing how desperate you are to sound retarded. I love it when you retards go on boards you no nothing about and post the same comments over and over as if you're clever--you're not.
I agree that daily distance matters more than speed but your also talking about endurance. Someone who isn't a weak faggot isn't going to struggle with a few extra pounds. Just because someone isn't "ultralight" doesn't mean they're packing retarded shit that's heavy.
the less there is a speed difference due to weight.
pure inexperience shown by posting this.
pace on steep terrain and all terrain class 3+ is measured in elevation change and your horizontal distance traveled is irrelevant.
it is the opposite of when you think, the time there is the greatest difference. just use your brain my post is common sense. how fast do you think you are at the climbing wall vs how fast are you with plates on your back? exactly.
endurance
virtually every endurance athlete is weight concious. have you seen how expensive racing bikes can get? 
over 90% of long distance hikers are ultralight and its been that way since the same time the gear became widely available, look at the surveys. the most accomplished outdoorsman alive with multiple world firsts right now in north america is an ultralighter. everyone who climbs knows your weight matters. no offense but i only see these sort of posts from people on 4chan who have never done anything and i always hear the polar opposite opinion from people who provably walk the walk.
Southern anons, what's the worst thing about hiking/camping/hunting/bushwacking in the beautiful south? Are chiggers really a thing?
chiggers
Holy fuck, yes they're real. Imagine having a bunch of extremely itchy scabs on your body that are actually tiny little tunnels those bastards carved in your skin to get at your juicy insides.
Yeghk. So long pants and pyrethrum?
Flashlights.
I'm a simple man, a one mode P60 is where it's at for me.
I had a lot of SolarForce hosts, but when I realized they had a cult following I foolishly sold them.
I'm back in the market, any recommendations? My initial research is pointing to Convoy S2+.
I've been wanting to go on a pilgrimage of sorts. My idea is to walk E1 from Nordkapp and finish it in black forest Germany. Perhaps continue on. 
My question is as follows: how do I prepare? 
What if this process is about putting it into hands of gods? The last time I set out to do a 4 day and 4 night no water no food hike to prove something dumb for myself, just as I set out a guy drove up to me and offered water. When I said 'okay' he as if he was sent by the committee of guides spirits or what it be, checked and said that he doesn't have any. Perhaps manifesting what I need for my journey and what I am planing to get out of it for myself is the key as retarded as it may sound
Has anyone had experience in walking lengthier trails?
just get a convoy. there are entire stores on aliexpress dedicated to parts for them.
My friend is in the same situation as you except we have to make new poles as well. You're probably best off with rebar unless you want to buy milsurp tent stakes (big metal ones like for pup tents). You probably want the tensioners as well, you can buy them in bulk for pretty cheap. Or you could try it without them and see if you don't need them.
Manila rope is all you need, idk the size. Maybe there's a spec sheet for what size was standard with a GP medium.
Post hoc ergo propter hoc
Appeal to authority
so, you're retarded, but I'll answer you anyways:
ALL RACERS IN ALL COMPETITIONS are concerned with weight because tenths of a second matter in a race. Those tenths of a second don't matter outside of competition.
So, to be clear, retard, shaving two pounds off a load will save you 7 minutes in 20 miles--which doesn't matter at all if you aren't racing.
Yes, it's obvious you have no experience. What you said is not only retarded--it's tangential to my point. I've done the comparison of weights at various elevations, which you haven't, and the result is more weight doesn't slow you down much (if you aren't a total limp wristed fag) up to a point. My max weight is much higher than yours so if I were to carry the EXACT weight as you I'd still be noticeably faster on any terrain.
Eventually I'd like around a dozen, but I suppose I don't need to be in an 'all or none' mindset. I'll get one and see how it goes

Why is military surplus clothing mostly Cotton?
Even winter gear. Is the military fucking retarded? 
Are they that fucking cheap?
If your question is "why not wool?" Then the answer is usually contract size. Expense aside, it's unlikely they got bidders who could supply the quantity required within stringent quality conditions.
(Military people may be about to come in and laugh about quality standards but most militaries make it very irritating for the supplier even if they're not efficient at getting good value)
I had a pair of German wool pants from the 1970s that were brand new when I found them in an army surplus store. The quality was such that I'd gladly pay $200 for another pair. But I've worn 60/40 with polypro underneath in the worst weather imaginable and didn't get too cold. Nowadays the US military has clothing for the coldest situations and it's as high speed low drag as anything you'll find in a good mountain gear shop. They don't sell it to surplus wholesalers very often because it costs so much to make. Check out Sportsman's Guide, they occasionally get some decent stuff for cold weather.
It could be /out/ when finding contacts remotely from a car.
Yeah, using a radio is very much an /out/ activity, I'm not saying they don't belong here, just that it would be redundant to have a general thread for them since there's already one on /diy/, and that's where the most knowledgeable hamfags hang out anyway
distance/time is speed

Much appreciated. What I can find on Neetsfoot oil is it's great for leather and not, not bad for carbon steel.
Cotton canvas weave is more durable than synthetic. That's all.
i need to buy bear spray. should i buy one particular brand or kind or something, or it's all the same? is the cheap aliexpress thing good enough?

everything is made in china nowadays though, it's a fair question
I was linked here from the other board when I asked a question, what do I do next?
I'll be bringing pic rel now that should last me
I'll be able to filter and I've got my route now, so I will filter
bread
Awful choice. Squishes down in the pack. Try tortillas or pita or something.
canned food
Not awful but not ideal choice. Cans add unnecessary weight
oranges
Heavy. Bringing a few is fine to eat on your first day but their weight does not justify their calorie count.
wafers
I think those are wafers of some sort? Your picture looks like it was taken by someone with Parkinson's disease. But those will be crushed to powder in your pack.
And the total amount of food is not nearly enough for 3 days of hard exercise. Just scrap your whole menu plan and start over. All your food should be light, tough and calorie dense, you chose the opposite of that. Try some of these:
Nuts are top tier. Tons of calories
Dried meats. Beef jerky, snack sticks, summer sausage
Oatmeal is also top tier. Can never go wrong with instant oatmeal for on the trail
Dry beans/rice/pasta. Lightweight things that can be turned into hearty meals by adding some water. Try products like those Knorr sides that add flavor to those things if you aren't much of a camp chef
Freeze dried meals if you can afford them
Some candy can be a good idea for a quick energy bump. Not too much of this and avoid candy that will melt in the heat.
I'm not saying you need to be all high speed low drag ultralight all the time, you can get away with some sub optimal choices if it's what you prefer. The herring filets are fine. But the food you pictured is literally the opposite of what you should do
Is there an archive for this board?
beef jerky
i dont think beef jerky is worth it for the price, if you can find thin summer sausages in like a snack shape form they're usually way cheaper and more calorie dense, often double the calories and half the price
thin summer sausages
Fuck that, just go whole hog and carry a summer sausage. Pare off pieces with your knife to eat. That's what I do, I prefer beef jerky but I am a poorfag so Great Value summer sausage it is
want to pick up a bike this spring, havent drove one since elementary. is this a good pick for $600?
Shill me a camp cup.
What's the best mushroom substrate? I got a mixture of wood chips, straw, and a little compost. Sound good?
Looks euro so the bread is probably pretty stiff, really depends on how jammed in there it is but yeah for 3 days you should be up at least near 2000 kcal per day. If that's 1 day thats probably ok or if it's just a sample of the sorts of things you're looking at.
I want to backpack this summer but all the permits in the area I want to visit are taken. Can I just show up? What are the chances some ranger actually asks to see my permit?
Anything cool in Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park? I will be passing through this weekend, and I will have my snowshoes with me.
They will never ever check for a park pass unless you do something retarded that gives them a reason. Just mind your own business and enjoy yourself and you will be fine.
The only challenge with not having a park pass is sometimes you need one in your windshield if you car in order to park, so that might or might not be a issue depending on the park.
Walk faggot
I have never checked for a park camping permit, ever, because I just don’t fucking care. I have women co workers who do and at most you will be asked to pay it as long as you play dumb as if you didn’t know there was such a thing. 
t. park ranja
any good resources you guys would recommend for listing flora/fauna by city/state?
right now I'm using inaturalist which seems good enough but if theres any better online resources I'd love to hear it. I also don't currently live in the city/state so local interest pamphlets are out.
If you're referring to the Desolation, they will absolutely inspect your bunghole if they see you on the trail, and they're out there.
They are very zealous/ jealous of "their" terrain, for understandable reasons (dumbshit visitors) but they will be rude about it. 
They have a thing for lurking in the bushes near your stated destination (required in the permit application) and then skulking up with a combo wheedling yet smarmy tone and demanding ze documentz. Practice saying, "Yahhh mina paperien sind in ordnung" with a sharp heel click.
Protip: visit some less popular wilderness areas that don't charge a fee for the permit, they exist and are far lest traveled, and ranger Dick won't ruin your immersion in the wild with his meddling.
bread
as >>2560894 already mentioned, in germany bread is very different from the toast you have in the US. its not squishy at all.
oranges
I like how they taste and they got vitamins. I'll take their weight.
wafers
yeah they are wafers. In hingsight they were probably not that good an idea. I'll go with thme anyways cuz I've already bought them now.
Nuts are top tier. Tons of calories 
alright added them 
Dried meats. Beef jerky, snack sticks, summer sausage
I've got two of those salamis now, 
Oatmeal is also top tier. Can never go wrong with instant oatmeal for on the trail
I'll go with Pasta instead, they are just as much effort and taste thrice as good.
Dry beans/rice/pasta. Lightweight things that can be turned into hearty meals by adding some water. Try products like those Knorr sides that add flavor to those things if you aren't much of a camp chef
^^^^
Freeze dried meals if you can afford them
no
Some candy can be a good idea for a quick energy bump. Not too much of this and avoid candy that will melt in the heat.
them wafers and oranges.
thanks for all the tips, I've integrated them in my meal plan now. 
ok 2k per day is now in the pic. I'll be going 4 days and that roghly 8.5k going from the values they showed on the packaging. 
thanks for the help
Issue with the bread isn't just being squishy, it's also bulk. By definition bread has air pockets, even if it's not Burgerland bread that is soft and squishy it is still not as tough and compact as something like pita bread or tortillas. And it takes up more space than it should in your pack.
Other than that good improvements. We only give you shit because we want to help you improve, get the fuck /out/ there and do shit and I hope you have a good time and gain some valuable experience.
What kind of mushrooms are you trying to grow? If you're trying to really intensively grow some mushrooms inside (and I can probably guess what kind of mushrooms you want), then use 2 to 1 vermiculite and brown rice flour. Use a steam bath or pressure cooker to sterilize the substrate before you try to colonize it. Remember that contamination doesn't target your desired mycelium, it targets uncolonized substrate, so keeping everything sterile before adding your spores is important.
Red wine caps, and I'm growing them outside.
Ok, I know nothing about growing mushrooms outside (and now you can probably guess what kind of mushrooms I want). The point I made earlier about the substrate still stands. If I were trying to do an outside grow of any mushrooms, I would start the same way, by sterilizing substrate and colonizing it with mycelium inside. Then, once it was fully colonized, I'd roll the colonized cakes in more substrate, and put them outside lightly covered in mulch or something. That gives your grow a head start even if you're not keeping it in a sterile environment the whole way like I do with my grows.
Do you recommend getting a GPS? If so, which one do you guys recommend?
Not unless you need something better than what your phone can do. I got the app GPS Essentials for my phone which gives you coordinates and other specific data
i wouldnt bother with a gps unless you are doing some serious backcountry hiking, or youre wealthy enough to not care about money. the cheap garmins are kind of crap and are basically a digital compass to point you at a destination, the expensive ones are cool but also very expensive. your phone and a power bank is good enough imo

My arms are pretty long. ~23 in or 59 cm. I'd like a light, packable jacket like the Patagonia Houdini for hiking and running. Which jacket is similar but tailored to lanklets?
trying one last time, anyone?
No one cares about either of those things. We know you don’t hike so why are you even bothering?
Can anyone recommend a good headlamp for night hiking?
thanks, will take it into account.
still here yes. its not this year, next probably.
how do you think about a timing around now (end of march - april)?
so far that seemed to me to be the best compromise.

The last can I bought (I think in 2010) was Counter Assault. I never deployed it. Years before that I bought a can from a friend but I can't remember what brand.

So far so good, but I've got a few decades of experience to guide me.
Anyone have experience with the Eureka Jade or Copper Canyon? They come recommended and have good reviews across the board, but they just don't look like they would handle rain well.

As a complete and utter beginner, it is at all possible to learn wilderness backpacking reasonably through online guides? I'm trying to find immersive paid lessons in my area, but I can't seem to find what I'm looking for. They either cover tangential topics I'm not interested in (i.e. guided kayaking trips), not wilderness backpacking itself, or seem to cover barer basics than I'd like (how to hike?). Or maybe I'm such a greenhorn that I don't understand what I'm looking for.
Whatever the case, I'd rather not be on local news as the latest urban idiot trying to "get in touch with nature" to die by getting fucked up by an animal, treating water incorrectly, or otherwise inadvertent suicide from incompetence.
The bottom line is, I have no idea how to get started, or "how to learn". This is a completely new skill to me, and I don't want to fuck it up. The goal is to try to eke out a full weekend solo trip and hike and camp around Killarney Provincial before the season's out. Learning how to bowhunt/fish/gather would be a huge bonus that I want to get started on as well.
As a complete and utter beginner, it is at all possible to learn wilderness backpacking reasonably through online guides?
yeah absolutely, thing is though most of the knowledge will come from experience anyways and video guides just forms the basis for that, the only course i would recommend you to take is a wilderness first aids course if you are planning long trips where you are far away from help
it seems like most deaths happen due to complete negligence of safety and 0 brain usage anyways
I have no idea how to get started

if you mean youtube videos, no not really, you can learn some tricks here or there but whenever you watch that stuff you have to keep in mind 95% of the people on there are weekend warrior types who larp but don't speak from experience. if you don't trust me on that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr2wJTcbJMQ [Embed] this boomer's spot on about it. there's some people out there who are exceptions and do know their shit and also happen to do youtube, DYOR on if they're actually someone worth noting or not. sadly, "survival" is a highly lucrative and trendy "entertainment" category right now... there's a lot of bullshittery to filter through.
if by online guides you mean stuff like pdfs of books and field manuals and shit, by all means, yeah you can learn a ton.
plebbit is a decent online resource. you get a lot of the most knowledgeable people in the world posting on there, but also a lot of retards because its reddit. its good for getting any localized info because its the biggest board. 
anon already pointed you to skurka's blog. an example of an extremely knowledgeable redditor who's shit is worth reading. everything in other anon's post is good shit. long trips can also be made way safer by going with a buddy and/or bringing a rescue beacon. always have a loud whistle (storm, acme thunderer, hyperwhistle, fox40, etc) and a small signal mirror (i like the laminated paper kind you can throw in your wallet)
cont.
you're in a northern climate so you actually have real seasons and weather and stuff to worry about. gearfagging will matter more to you than the average anon. start with hiking when the weather's good. you don't have grizzlies or anything over there but there's a lot of black bears in your area so you'll want to learn what the "bear muda triangle" is and learn your local etiquitte/laws for what you need to do about bears+food before doing an overnighter. some areas just make you "pct hang" it, some places you need a canister, some places you can get away with a thick bear bag (ursak) and some you won't need anything.
really anon the best way to learn is just go on small trips and build your comfort level, get used to your area, etc. no need to push yourself or anything. you don't actually need classes for anything unless/until you get into specialized stuff like idk mountaineering or climbing or diving or whatever. best teacher for survival's experience and there's one way to start getting it.
Start small. Lurk on gearfag threads and watch youtube videos until you have some idea, do some day hiking to make sure you're physically up to it, then plan a 2 day hike and camp with just a couple mile hike each way--but treat it as if you were on the fucking AT and try to do everything right. Learn from your mistakes, work out the kinks in your gear, get an idea of what physical shape you're in and gradually keep upping the distance and number of nights out.
holy shit I hate women so much it's unreal
they didn't have gps in ww2 dumbass
These are fantastic suggestions. Thanks so much for the detailed advice. Excited to get rolling.
This is probably a better place to ask this question:
Can I use cheap asics on multiday trails this summer? I carry about 30 pounds and its mostly forest trails, agriculture roads, some paved roads, there are multiple trails between 60 and 140 miles I want to walk.
What would be the downsides?
Learn by doing short hikes during summer. Start small. You can't really learn much from other's experiences posted online unless you have your own experience to compare to. You will only end up spending money on things you don't need. Don't buy anything unless you know from experience that you need it.
yes you can just fine.
when modern athletic shoes with rubber soles first hit the open market after world war 2 they pretty much replaced mountaineering and rock climbing footwear for a few decades.
the main downsides:
casual athletic type sneakers will have a cheaper outsole compound, just means less grip on wet algae covered rocks and stuff like that, but still suitable.
the outsole won't have an /out/ oriented lug pattern or depth so they'll slip more than a proper trail shoe in mud. but again they'll still be fine. 
you probably size your running shoes pretty close to your brannock measurement true to size. hiking shoes you do want sized a little big because long distances downhill after your feet have swollen a bit from hiking in a tts fitted shoe can fuck your toes up from bumping against the toe of the shoe on extended declines 'black toes' and lead to some toenail condition i forgot the name of. 
and they'll have no rock plates but its becoming popular and trendy to sell trailrunners without them anyways.
the 2 biggest reasons i'd say to even have dedicated shoes for (disclaimer: more casual) hiking purposes are:
- wanting a different size than your normal shoes
- not wanting to fuck your city shoes up, dedicated beater
for a bit of evidence i'm too lazy to dig up their profiles but there's several people who have done PCT in $15 wal mart/costco athletic shoes the entire way, there's an anon on here who thru hikes in sandals, i'm actually thinking about doing the same because he was really convincing, and there's also a guy on reddit who did pct except the sierras and at in wal*mart fake crocs.
shoes constructed like converse and vans used to un ironically be good rock climbing shoes not even too long ago.
Interesting. I have ultra-light trailrunners already. But they were kinda expensive (altra lone peak) and I only use them for running trails a few times a week. I don't want to take those hiking because they are too soft and wobly with a pack.
Would you take something like a solid running shoe (I had this Nike ten years ago) or a more solid hiking shoe like a Merrell Moab?
i personally do my day hiking in $20 running shoes or trail running shoes from costco. walmart's even better but i don't have one around me. 
for the sole purpose of not wearing out expensive footwear on hikes i don't need anything remotely approaching it on.
works gr8 for me. i see no problem with either way you go.
Makes sense. I try to do that too for daily walks but in this case I will be going for extended weekends 4 to 5 days a few times this summer. Do you still take cheap shoes for that?
Can anyone redpill me on traditional leather boots and recommend how I can get some for cheap?
I'm fed up with buying new boots every year. I'm willing to compromise on the qualities that make modern boots so good like light weight and shock absorption in exchange for some fucking longevity. Also I really like the idea of being able to repair your own boots by re-stitching leather, replacing soles and shit to keep them going for years and years, the self sufficiency thing really appeals to me. But most boots constructed like that that I can find are steel toe or way too heavy for hiking.
Should I buy into the meme and just buy surplus army boots like pic related? I want to save money and I don't mind having to do some work on them when I buy them, it would be cool to learn the skill anyway. I still want them to be as light weight and hiking friendly as possible as long as they are simple construction and leather.
How do I get an out related job with no relevant experience? I don't care if it's shitty (I know it will be)
Noted. Thanks for your input!

the feature you're looking for is a full leather midsole.
 to keep them going for years and years, the self sufficiency thing really appeals to me.
all boots are consumable items. with a resoleable boot you're not actually keeping the boot for years and years, only the upper half of the boot, the other half of the boot gets replaced at about the same frequency modern hiking boots wear out. so to set realistic expectations, the difference is you keep half the boot for about 3 to 6 resoles on average depending on the construction type and quality of the boot, before the entire thing eventually wears out. the leather flanges on the upper that have to be sewn to resole a boot are the limiting factor to the lifespan of the entire boot no matter how nice you keep the condition of the rest of the upper. each resole disintegrates it gradually, its not a whole lot of material. there's some ways to make a boot resoleable more times but it comes with compromises and you don't see it commonly.
for the above reasons my redpill you can take or leave is that polyurethane non resoleable boots are the best compromise.
they last anywhere from 1000-2000 miles. so at the worst they last longer than a full leather old school boot would before it needs a resole and at best about twice as long, which is conveniently about the same amount of miles as the upper lengths of most long distance hikes people do. meaning you can do basically any thru hike or multiple section hikes with a single pair. 
they're infinitely less 
I'm willing to compromise on the qualities that make modern boots so good
this, and your boots will weigh half as much, these aren't small compromises. but they last up to 4x as long as eva foam boots without a HUGE hit to comfort compared to them.
if you do want all leather boots:
workwear/logging and milsurp, that kind of boot isn't considered a hiking boot anymore.
Is it worth putting weed mat at the bottom of my raised garden beds?
you keep half the boot for 3 to 6 resoles
As a poorfag with a prepping/survivalism fetish that sounds like a good deal to me. Remember that money is a big reason I am doing this, I assume the materials required to do a resole are pretty cheap relative to the cost of new boots? Assuming I can do the work myself which seems like a fun skill to learn desu. And as for the weight I can always switch to trail runners if I'm going on a very long hike, this would be more for general /out/survival shit and woods larping than serious high speed low drag backpacking.
If I am going to go the leather route any tips on what to look for and what to avoid? It sounds like milsurp is my best bet, work boots always have steel toes nowadays and the military at least has some incentive to make boots that are light and good for hiking. The /k/ meme Austrian paratrooper boots are a little out of my budget for now but maybe I can find something similar.
polyurethane non resoleable boots are the best compromise
Never heard of that, isn't that what they make rain and muck boots out of? Can you give me an example of what kind of polyurethane hiking boots you're talking about?
So landscaping
Assuming I can do the work myself
JFC anon this is obviously not going to be worth your time. Just buy surplus boots and be done with it.
But I'm an autistic /diy/ fag and I take a lot of pleasure from accumulating random skills. I watched some people re-soling old boots on Youtube and it didn't look that hard to do as long as you buy all the right types of glue and that cork paste shit you use to go between the sole and the bottom layer of leather.
Besides, that would make the difference between whether this was a smart decision to make. If I'm going to burn through the milsurp boots just as fast as regular hiking boots then there's no point
In general you won't burn through soles any faster or slower with any option, and while replacing JUST the soles is cheaper, it comes with the ancillary costs of buying a high quality leather upper and learning to cobble shoes.
The free market has given you an opportunity here. Take it, I implore you.
Depends on what's underneath it and how deep your soil is. Usually it's a waste of money.

I thought so, this is eastern Pennsylvania right near Philadelphia. I saw these pop up as the grass and other stuff has started to grow and I was rendering some tallow that I was considering turning into a candle. From what I read earlier this doesn't exactly emit a scent so that idea is scrubbed. I'm considering yanking a bunch of this up and tossing them into the field behind my house for the bees to have some interesting stuff to work on in a few years.
Figured you guys would know better than /fa/ or some other place.
What jacket reccs do you have for spending a few hours in 25-60 degree weather? I'm gonna be walking around the woods, construction sites or other places where snagging is pretty likely, and it'll be windy most times. I don't want it to seem giga tryhard though cause I'll have to show up at my (very casually dressed) office.
make a thread
To be desu, I just layer with whatever base layer top is handily laying on the floor, a tee shirt over that, a cheap fleece jacket (also from somewhere in the house but never hanging in the closet) and and old and leaky North Face gortex parka.
I agree with >>2564265, fleece liners are a fucking godsend. Pair a fleece liner with a jacket of harder material, denim or leather are good choices for construction sites and weight shouldn't be an issue for that use case. Plus that way when it's a 60 degree day you can ditch the fleece so you don't overheat.
Gore-Tex is also a good choice though personally I'm more comfortable with denim or leather when I know I will be abusing it on a job site, I usually buy secondhand so I don't feel bad about destroying them
Is the xmid a good tent or is it just a reddit meme tent?
Need a tent for backpacking, and it seems to be a good price/weight ratio with no major drawbacks. It's hard finding out about gear when everything online is SEO ad spam these days.
It is a good tent, you'll be fine. Obligatory 'trekking pole tent' note, youd need poles, good stakes, appropriate terrain, and familiarity with pitching what is essentially a sharped tarp. Hit the field and practice.
Thanks. Bought the 1p since I only ever plan on going on weekend trips.
I’ll practice in my backyard a few times so I don’t embarrass myself
I paid $155 Canadian dollars for dachstein wool gloves only to be extremely disappointed. I wore them outside in -20c (-4f) and the cold went RIGHT through them.
So what should I replace them with? What’s the warmest glove you’ve ever worn?
If you're out in -20c you should have some Black Daimond Goretex gloves or equivalant.
just get a cloudup 2. trekking pole tents fucking suck dick
Wool is not windproof. You need shellgloves that go over the wool. Over beaverfur gloves if you want to go natural down to -30F/C.
I have severe arachniphobia. Whenever I sleep, I am paranoid there are spiders that will crawl into my hammock. 
How do I calm the paranoia?
a bug net, acceptance
you will never get over a fear until you confront it head on, simple as that. go find a spider and become comfortable in its presence
Can i burn wood in my gas fireplace?
a polartec 100/200 weight or grid or high pile fleece, maybe one warm one less warm one since theyre $20 and thats such a big range.
then whatever shell over top to handle the wind and abrasion. 
fleece is what you want for this but it doesn't protect you from wind. you can get a basic one for like $10-20 and maybe like $100 tops for the super fancy kind with a hood armpit zips etc. milsurp ecwcs high pile ones are a good cheapo warm one.
i'm scared of going /out/
what if i forget to bring something? what if i carry too much shit? what if i run out of water or fall down a ditch?
how to cope with /out/ related anxiety? i'm not very social so groups are out of the question
how do hermits manage to survive in the wilderness alone for years?
what if i forget to bring something
i used to forget things a lot and i like to wake up very early for trips. now i keep all my gear at home in organizer bins and then organized within them by stuff sack. i don't use the stuff sacks when i'm on my trips, i just empty them out in the backpack, they're just to organize at home. i pack my bag the day before when i'm wide awake. anything that doesn't go in the pack like phone keys etc i write down on a list for the morning of. 
what if i carry too much shit? what if i run out of water or fall down a ditch?
start off with easier hikes where these things won't matter till you build enough knowledge and experience where those things won't matter/happen.
too much shit? experience to help you plan better next time.
water? start learning how to find and identify water sources in your area. filter some of your own water on a dayhike. get used to looking for it slash planning where potential water sources are when you're doing your trip planning at home before. then you'll have a sense for it when it matters.
fall down a ditch? i can get hit by a car any time i cross the street too. shrug.
XGK EX is a snow melting, water boiling stove only. Its plastic pump feels like junk too. I had one. 
Look at Primus Optifuel or Optimus Polaris. My Optimus replaced my XGK. It’s a little heavier, but I like it better all round.
they dont, its a larp.
I bought an XGK EX, it ended up being the cheapest out of everything because there was a discount. I'll try it out and see how it goes. If nothing else I can make soup.. But I can often use campfires to cook on too
What do you use to wash your merino wool? I have Grangers but it's expensive and only seems to be available on Amazon.
i just throw it in the washing machine with all my other clothes
Bugs suck. The humidity is also killer in the summer.
Chiggers, ticks, scabies, poison ivy/oak/sumac, you name it.
Do you prefer using a water bladder or a bottle? I've always just used a nalgene for day hikes but the bladders seem neat, not sure what brands are good though.
bottles all day.
dr bronners unscented soap (just the normal kind, or anything like it) or some woolite extra dark. i hand wash all my wool in a bucket for longevity but cold+no spin cycle is fine too.
these instructions are fine for all wools not just merino.
99.5% of merino wool can be washed like your normal clothes with no special care. they strip the lanolin out of the wool and coat it with a resin when the textile is produced to make it machine washable. no special care needed unlike other wools. but i would avoid the spin cycle like any other delicate item. 
i used to, but now i use bottles with those modified caps that let you use a whip hose with them.
smartwater/dasani most of the time, nalgene in the winter.
buuuut i still like bladders when i'm day hiking or when i'm somewhere like a desert carrying high volumes. i use platypus ones. being easy to fill and clean are the features you want to look for. you might also want to plan around being able to hang your bladder in a tree so you can gravity filter. its convenient as fuck and if you make a diy kit it can be only a few grams.
I kinda want to try the toe shoe meme, but I don't know the difference between all these models. Which kind should I get? I'm not a runner, it would be for day hiking and light backpacking in the woods, lots of granite and hills in my area

suggestions for rough, durable yet flexible /out/ pants?
they don't exist anymore because they are not as profitable. People want pants that break after a year.
chinos
Can someone recommend/link me a camping pot with the following attributes:
less than 3lbs
about 1.2 liters and 8in diameter (wide enough to cook in, but deep enough to boil water)
has a lip/spout
has an attached lid that snaps into position (whether open or closed)
has a folding side handle (to hold it like a pan)
has top handle (to hang it over fire)
I would have thought that all of this was pretty much common sense, but I can’t seem to find any one pot that has it all. The closest I’ve found is my image, but the lip on that is welded on, which is not ideal, I’d rather the whole pot just be one piece, and the lid is not attached to the pot, it’s loose.
Does anyone know how to get black needlerush out of the skin easily?

Water's been nerfed since the last update. The minimum per diem is now twenty litres.
utah/colorado in may. im from ontario and i've really only done fair weather stuff so its was fine with any shoes if i wasn't going too far. i will only be doing day hikes, but i still don't want to overpack
It was 80 degrees in the lower elevations in southern Utah today, and it'll hit the 90s in early May. Conversely, the snow in the higher elevations in northern Utah and Colorado will still be five feet deep in May. There's a lot of in between so pack for elevation and terrain.

Post stupid question, get brutally direct wisdom.
emergency signaling
Yeah, if there's fog or rain to create a light beam. Other than that it's useless, if you do manage to flash a plane with it (doubtful you could aim it that well), they'll just see a bright momentary blink, think "fucking kids" and fly on.
you can start fires with them
You can start fires with a lighter or hurricane matches
fend off animals
You can use bear spray, a stick, or a gun
It's not good enough at any of those use cases to justify carrying it. Besides, high power lasers use a lot of power, so you either have a fuck heavy one, or you have like 2 minutes of battery. Either way it is not worth carrying. I see why you would think that initially, but really if you had a signal mirror, a Bic lighter and a Ruger LCP, you'd have all that functionality you mentioned, 10x better than a laser could do it, lasting for way more uses, and probably weighing less.

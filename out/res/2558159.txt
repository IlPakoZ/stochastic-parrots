Have you ever taken a girl /out/?
yeah 2nd date with my current gf was an overnighter
idk if that many girls would accept that in retrospect, but its a very good way to build trust and get an idea of how well u live together
Yes. My wife and I will get drunk, take charcoal and draw over each others bodies, then dance naked around the fire.
And sex?
Yeah I used to go hiking with my ex. My current GF does not like the outdoors much and does not mind me going /out/ regularly by myself and I lowkey prefer it this way. I can do whatever I want at my own pace.
my ex and I would go hiking regularly, she would have me take photos of her infront of a rock or tree for her instagram, i was never allowed to be in them. she once threw a temper tantrum because we had to cross a muddy creek and she refused to get her shoes muddy
yes but it implied we wouldn't be able to go as far/as fast as I usually go, so it's a fun experience but shouldn't be done everytime you go /out/
have fat gf
actually decent personality
wants to try hiking 
take her on a short one
out of breath most of the time and complains here and there but manages to climb to the top
said she liked the experience in the end (and photos for her profile obviously)
Considering everything 6/10, will be better if she manages to stop stuffing her mouth with food at every oppprtunity
wtf why would sex a wife? beeing married is like friendzone platinium
Yes, she loves being taken by the fire. We plan on doing a week long trip in the Olympic peninsula in a couple months.
His said his wife, so no. Sex ends after marriage.
OP wearing cotton pants right next to a massive water hazard
ngmi
Mixed results
My newlywed wife and I have been hiking/kayaking buddies for 8 or 9 years, that is mostly all we do together in our outing times
Ever? Of course. 
Recently? Not really. 
In recent years, one of the main reasons I go /out/ is to get AWAY from my wife
Yes the gf hates hiking
Excuses.
Yes, she just bitched the whole time, it sucked.
I dated a girl I met on trail. Twice actually. Does that count? Otherwise no. I don't take girls /out/.
I can't even imagine talking to a woman if she isn't into /out/ as much as I am. Every gf I've had was into backpacking, climbing, camping, nature, etc. I don't care if a chick isn't into fishing and hunting -- I don't expect them to be. If she's anti-hunting that's the end of it. I've turned down some otherwise decent women because they we're anti-hunting.
Of course, my mom, my cousins, my sister.
does not much like the outdoors
Then why date her?
outdoorsy/rural women are the best
the true american dream is to hunt with a wife like her
You just know her ass is as flat as a washboard. Got that hank hill butt.
just accept her supremacy
Julia?
I may be an incel virgin manlet, but the last thing I want when I'm outdoors is the company of other people.
Nope. Huge pain in the ass. The tribes of our pre-agricultural ancestors left women back in the cave or at camp except when they were migrating to a new cave or camp. Partly this was due to reproductive math, but just as importantly, women are slow, weak, fragile liabilities.
These are modern women we're talking about, too, so that's squared.
Yes, she was all of 5" and mogged me at 30+ miles a day with a heavier pack.
5" 
Based pixie dater
Fuck.
We werent dating at all.
You ever look back and realise how autistic youve just been.
"You me, going walking next week"
I say yeah, okay
fuck there were signs.
I want to know more !
Based.
Last time a woman tagged along a hike in a group of mine she had a mental breakdown 200m from the summit and did everything possible so none of the rest of the guys would reach it either.
Then all of sudden had coke energy down the mountain so nobody could keep up.
They do have the physical capabily but some of them don't have the right mindset to get things done right.
What do you mean
That sounds retarded why wouldnt the people just go touch the summit then go back to her if she created a scene that needed attention
At the summit going around the mountain would've been exactly the same distance going back just on the other side with new views and experiences so that's what we would've done.
I believe that was the problem that she couldn't take anymore "uncertainties".
Simply not an explorative mind.
I really doubt the problem was reaching the summit when it was just a few steps more.
I could be wrong, I mean I look at it logically and she probably wasn't.
And yeah it was retarded, her husband is a cuck and wouldn't manage her for the rest of us and nobody else felt like meddling in his affair, it would've been hell rest of weekend for him so we thought we did him a favour.
The point is I agreed with anon they are better left to tend the cave.
5 feet tall
likes to go /out/
For the love of God anon why didn't you breed her immediately
How do you get a girls number/ get to know her from an interaction on a trail?
Point a gun at her.
I just talk to them but never ask women out unless they drool over me and walk after me. Modern women, It's all just so tiering... You are better off alone. Safe for your retirement and property purchase. Don't waste your time, nerves, or resources. Women will chase after you if you are ever good enough.
Have you ever taken a girl /out/?
Yes. Often. First time I took my wife canoe camping was the first time she'd not slept within eye or ear sight of a car. It was the happiest I've ever seen her.
It's a win-win for me because I need a few weeks by myself every year and women are kind a pain in the ass when going /out/. When I was still with my ex who enjoyed going /out/ I always ended up going for different routes than I actually wanted to.
Most women don't like the outdoors. It's easier to just accept it. I've dated only one woman that actually wanted to go /out/, the rest think it's a novelty and they aren't interested in doing much more than a simple hike on a short and easy trail.
Like the other anon said, that's okay. It means you get /out/ time to yourself. One thing I make clear to any girl I'm dating is that she doesn't have to accompany me, but I will have my /out/ time. I've had a couple girls break up with me because I was too busy climbing. They think it's a phase or something I guess.
Yeah she only comes out in the summer though so I have to go months in between where nobody sucks my willy outdoors
nothing better than hiking with a tanned skin cutie
I went on a mountain biking date with a girl, it went fine until I mentioned I owned guns. Oh well, she wasn't very good anyways and was a broke-ass. I fucking hate poor women.
My court mandated female said she would if she can take edibles before
That looks suspiciously like a Filipina gf.
gf refuses to go camping because she doesn't like the idea of not having a toilet nearby. i'm okay with this though because she still loves golfing and fishing.
You right anon
Apart from when I'm a fucking pasty ginger getting sunburned to shit and she just wants to absorb sun rays but it's worthwhile
Sand nig gf
Never found a woman who can keep up. They're keepers of the hearth, not outdoorsmen
preciate yew
hi again mr japanese-sword-i'll-be-vague-with-the-name how have u been?
No I don't know how to talk to those
This
Her body my choice
Decent desu 
Haven't shot up any tescos yet
Beta fags piss me off more than roasties.
be me riding the river trail, see a qt walking her bike
pull over, Hey looks like you have a flat
teehee yeah but I'll just walk it home
Nah, let me sort that out
fix flat, ride along and start BSing
Hey, where's your turn?
lolz we passed it a few miles back
sheeeeit, wanna ride again?
Wink wink
Next Saturday we ride up to Folsom lake, I'm wondering if she's going to give it up
Didnt bring a swimsuit teehee, jumps in wearing a white sports bra
watch her walk back with nerbs fully shining through
Boinked.png
She turned out to be a waste of time too, but I'll not soon forget those titties
very based
Based. OP is probably one of the prettiest places I've hiked around. You get into the ancient old Hoh rainforest and it's really a spiritual experience anon. If you've never been though prepare for rain. The OP gets like 200" a year.
Man I would cut my balls off to just like the port o john seat she uses after a day in August when all she's had to eat is taco bell
Take a girl /out/? What are you? Fucking gay?
Tinder match
Hiking tag
We go hiking innawoods
She's wearing Doc Martens and leggings
She's slow as fuck
Steps into a 2 foot puddle 20 minutes in because she can't judge the depth
Complains about being cold the whole way
I brought extra socks just for her since I knew there'd be problems.
brings extra socks
you must get all the ladies damn
likes girls
is gay
???
Christianity is so fucking gay, holy shit
Yes I took a girl i was dating out to my fishing pond late night. One thing happened than another and talking looking at stars, than her hands are down my pants. Did the sucky sucky and than the session was loud, surprised no one heard. Walked back to car and driver her home. She was just a friend with benefits, I still miss her but damn don't get pregnant from someone while dating someone else. Dumb whore she was, all you had to say was you wanna suck my nob and she'd get to it.
Undiagnosed Autism/homosexuality probably
what's part of the olympics are you planning on? I'm heading up to to the Low Divide area again this year
you know it
this but unironically
all of my married friends, at best, look forward to their annual birthday handjob
They married the wrong woman then. Plenty of marriages feature at least semi-regular sexy time.
Sex ends after marriage
imagine unironically believing this
it's true tho
for you maybe lol
I asked one for hike to local castle ruin, she said she has bad knees.
I would salute you but there are snipers everywhere.
And you're a faggot, your specific reason for asking is because you're a faggot
You missed the joke retard.
https://youtu.be/YZsMz7uwbR0 [Embed]
She seems a little retarded, just how I like ‘em
im in a few hiking groups, and i just gotta say, women are waaay better at distance hiking, but borderline useless at actual camping
Went hiking with a girl a few times. It's great, I'm fat but she's small and likes to pick flowers so we go slow. My male friends just walk too fast, I can keep up but it's not enjoyable.
My girlfriend is pretty good with cooking, setting up the tent and cleaning dishes. Sounds like you're going camping with low quality city girls.
yes and her family is still searching for her 
mfw
women are good at aimlessly walking from A to B, and suck at something that requires thinking in addition to work
Whodathunkit
camping requires a lot of thinking
Yes, if your IQ is &lt; 80
Who said anything about a lot?
Camping doesn't require any more thinking than hiking does. For camping, you need to select an optimal site and for hiking, you need to plan your route and have the navigation skills to get back on course if you lose your way. Camping involves condensation management and staying warm/dry. So does hiking. Setting up and taking down a tent isn't rocket science, as millions of casuals do it every year. Same with preventing critters from getting at your food. Minimal thinking involved there.
the bible literally says that married people should have sex whenever they want. Example. If I want to have sex with my wife when she's not in the mood, she should have sex with me anyway. 
But you don't actually care to understand what the bible says, you'd rather just worship satan.
trips of womanhood
Women use hiking trails. Show me a woman who hikes off-trail using a route she mapped out beforehand and I'll show you an outlier.
t.
It’s our favorite thing to do. We banged on the top of the north fork, it was nice and now I want to conceive my first child up there
Mine too. She gets right to cooking throwing up the tent etc as I start getting a fire going / wood gathering
You're not from Ohio, are you? I may have run into you before.
Nope but close, Western PA
How did you get over that trail pussy smell?
Took sister on our usual Dad/Son hunting mission. Got nearly to where we wanted to go and she freaked tf out at the last obstacle. tbf it was a pretty gnarly slip and I was pretty happy not to fry cross it but the thing is because it freaked her out she didn't want to go down the way she came up which had visual exposure to the obstacle but was otherwise safe. She wanted to go directly down the steep slippery tussock slope that would have been extremely dangerous and she would certainly fall in the current state she was in. Took a stern talking to convince her not to walk down the slippery shit that was way more dangerous than the perceived visual danger. This was right after she just froze and stopped moving at all for like 5 mins until I realized she was freaking tf out. Hard work man, then she was smug for the rest of the day because of her decision not to do the dangerous thing and stop us from reaching the cool place, lmao.
Off topic but that reminds me of taking my roomate up Shasta, he had never worn crampons or held an ice axe. The route was steep but conditions were good, but pretty soon after we traversed a snowfield I noticed him getting wide eyed. Then he started really bugging out. 
I had to give him the stern talk, got him to keep moving into a small boulder patch where he promptly laid down and fell dead asleep. I laughed, what else could I do. Let him sleep for an hour and he woke up collected, so we retreated. 
Summit fail but we got to hang out on a volcano so no big deal.
white dudes who don’t have enough friends and expect their wives to be masculinized and share hobbies with them don’t make sense to me
you must be lonely fellas
shut up, boy. it's not wanting a girl to align with you entirely, but wanting to share adventures together. /out/ is not only for men. you wouldn't get it... you fucking grotesque abomination
brownoid
Opinion discarded
Don't be a pussy and deal with it.
Bible-based anon. kek and correct
Based I've been lovebombing a girl I madeout with cause she posts her drawings on the internet and they look too much like mine so I can read them easily
I can't wait to get to charcoal runes so soon..
Why do you follow what the Bible says and not the Quran, Talmud or some other bullshit? Hint: it's because your parents told you to, and literally no other reason.
bruh you know it reeks
wanting to share adventures together
how the fuck do you hit post on something like this and not die of embarrassment
bump
Why did the tranny jannies delete all the pictures like this? It's an ancient /out/ meme.
i didn't even realize. hope i don't get banned just for that
But I'm not sure. The /out/ janny has a quick trigger finger on the ban which is good for some things (obliterating frogs) but otherwise can be pretty random and autistic
inb4 this post gets deleted and i get a global ban for "criticizing moderation staff"
Bruh, you just gotta mentally associate that reek with getting your dick wet. Gives me a Pavlovian boner every time.
Bruh
BRUH.
Yeah man, I wonder how many people getting lost and dead in the wilderness are just people freaking out and short circuiting.
Damn. I don't even know how to respond to this. It's just filthy.
brrruh are you me? lost my V hiking, and ever since... duuude i im just hardwire for that frfr no cap sheeesh
that stank nasty, it make me soft no cap
I'm thinking of getting one of these badboys and becoming a druid of my flat ass marshy land.
kek, wrong thread.
Bruh that's nothing. Childbirth smells exactly like field dressing a deer.
It has always ended in rape, so I don't do it anymore. It was too much raping and not enough hiking.
has anyone ever had their peepee touched by a woman? please tell me.
Yeah that's how I found out what childbirth smells like.
Why is this thread so focused on smell?
Because it's about women and /out/ and bears are attracted to the smell of women's menses and you need to be aware of shit like that or yngtmi
bump
*sniff*
do i smell good
Dunno, my tcp/ip olfactory bridge seems to be malfunctioning. But I just sniffed my wife and she smells good.
mfw anon didn't post a tate-certified based sigma grindset egoist moment bashing a hecking libtard snowflake
Nice legs but her face looks like shit
It was terrible. She loved "hiking and camping" and brought her overweight "hiking companion" pug and a chihuahua with her. We took breaks every couple yards so she could adjust something, catch her breath, or smoke weed. Half a mile down the trail we had to turn back because she had already finished her snacks, her entire water supply, all her weed (4 bowls worth), and her dogs were completely cashed out. We ended up going home and watching Alaska documentaries for several hours while she repeatedly mentioned that she could totally make it up there.
I've camped in hoh plenty of times, truly a beautiful place, great for mycology trips. I usually 0refer to go I to the Olympics just so air can plink away with a .22LR.
Usually near Quilcene, pass Penny Creek.
I meet girls on the trail all the time :x
t. /an/
oops forgot pic
You need to make sure women are suspended from a branch at night out of reach of bears.
myth
The guy below has more estrogen in him than the cattle he's carrying.
Guys who brag about having sex on hikes are as annoying and söy as guys who brag about doing psychedelics/weed outdoors. You're taking a sport that's challenging and respectable and reducing it to MUH DICK. Very gay
This sounds like an incel cope.

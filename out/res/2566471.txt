I've done my fair share of peak bagging and have seen some good electrical storms but I've never been hit by lightning and I don't know anybody who has. Getting hit by lightning is so rare that it's used to describe an extremely rare occurrence such as a deadly bear attack. So what's all the fearful talk about? Seems to me it's just another thing that "experienced" outdoorsmen use to scare the newfags. Sorry folks, I don't pack my fears.
So what's all the fearful talk about?
What fearful talk? Are you sure this isn't something you're imagining?
I've met exactly one person in my life who worried about the risk of getting struck by lightning and he had the bad luck to have already been struck twice so I figure he's allowed to be paranoid about lightning being out to get him. Apart from him - nada.
Imagine the feeling, the most powerful force of electricity chose you as it's vessel towards the earth. For that moment you are the most important thing all around. Then you're dead.
Lol. depends on where. I have been around enough close lightening strikes that blew up trees very near me to understand it is an actual risk. I have also been on top of OP's pic related and found out why its called that. But I also carry bear spray for the way down too...
I've never met a single person afraid of being struck by lightning. I've met people that find it startling, but they're not afraid of being struck by it.
That's what our life is bro
So what's all the fearful talk about?
who talking about it? It is a risk albeit small one. Just like a bear attack. But it does happen.

Been chased off towers by lightning storms a few times.
Fucking terrifying when you see corona discharge arcs between ladder and tower, hear the air crackling and popping.
Replaced a lot of blow'd up radios, cameras, PA's, polyphasers, transtectors.
RIP Nicholas Torchia. Killed by lighting while hiking on the Muir Ranch Trail in 2021.
That must have been shocking
RIP Wade Young. Killed by lightning on Humphrey's Peak, Arizona.
RIP John "Jack" Murphy. Killed by lightning while hiking near Enos Lake, Wyoming.
RIP Jonathan Crowden of Australia, killed by lightning while hiking at the Grand Canyon.
I've been within 100-200 yards or so of a cloud to ground strike. If you aren't afraid of being struck after that, you simply don't fear death.
I've had lightning strike a small tree a few feet away from me, but I'm still not concerned. Also, if you survive a lightning strike, the scar looks pretty fucking sick.
RIP Sam Beattie of Boston, killed by lightning while camping with his girlfriend at the top of Mount Warning, Australia.
It is not rare, you must also know how to "read" the weather, clouds tell you a lot about it, being at high altitude and near cumulonimbus type of clouds its very dangerous.
Thank you. I'll heed your advice as I sign summit registers this summer.
I stayed at this lookout during a lighting storm. Thankfully it had a rod attached to it. Was a pretty kino experience honestly.
Lightning only strikes chads
Guess I am safe then!
Verification not required.
im staying at mccart this year, wanted to last year but they were doing renovations. i did get struck by lightning staying in pic related though (Arid Peak)
Lightning is not a risk if you aren't doing things that increase your odds of getting hit, but you can make your odds quite high if you want to or are stupid enough to not understand.
Yeah they're literally one in a million in a broad view, but if you narrow your scope to "odds of getting hit by lightning during a thunderstorm while standing on high ground holding a metal pole above your head" it becomes quite likely, and quoting statistics at nature won't save you. If you want your odds to be the same as the average you can't do things that increase your risks, so being cautious about lightning is a good idea anyway.
Shark attacks are also very rare, even less common than lightning strikes if I'm seeing accurate numbers, but you still clear out of the water when one comes around.
When people get hit by lightning it leaves them with interesting scars, like pic.
Have fun! Watching the sunset over the Bitterroots is 10/10.
I want to be struck by lightning on a hike and be completely incinerated.
just double checked and theyve closed it for renovations this season... again. ill have to plan something else out i guess lol.
I'd suck the lightning bolt out of her tits
Damn, too bad. Was also going to mention there's huckleberry bushes all along the trail up there.
Probably not the worst way to go honestly
thanks anon. i live a few hours north so i got my not-so-secret huck spot, this year im going to try and get a bunch of bilberries but they are really tricky to pick a lot of.
I was on Tiger Mountain near the top today approaching a clear cut and some tall radio towers while it was snowing hard. Hadn't heard any thunder at all. All of a sudden maybe 100 ft. up I saw the lighting strike. It was incredible.
I got struck once during a tornado when I was 16 and then many years later, in a completely different c'untry, I almost got struck twice in the same storm (lightning struck the ground near me twice while I was making for shelter).
Fuck that shit, I don't go out when the skies are dark. Or when there's a chance of a freak lightning strike even before the storm hits.
I was on a laptop that was plugged into a charger during a storm
Lightning hit the pole, went through the laptop and shocked me
It was small like a static shock but I saw it arc from the speaker holes into my finger
Cool. I experienced a snow and lightning storm once too, pretty bizarre.
Did it damage the laptop?
Any neurological problems afterward?
Thundersnow is awesome. I wish it happened more often around here. I've been in one legit snowstorm where there was thunder for almost an hour and the sound was muffled because it was snowing so hard.
Well the bottom of my foot was burned and I swore that I was slow and lumbering for a few weeks but could have been my imagination.
I was huddled in the basement while all hell was breaking loose, and the house got struck right in the electrical conduit (which I was crouched right next to). Luckily the lightning destroyed every electronic device in the house on its way down. The washer, the dryer, the TVs, the computers, the fridge, the dishwasher, the refrigerators, 3 air conditioners, etc. Had the lightning not been buffered I would probably have died. All I remember is a flash like a shotgun blew off right in my face. My brother said a bolt of electricity arced out of the circuit board and hit me in the leg. I flew about 5 feet and all the skin on the sole of my foot was blistered. Good times.
pickerel
Jesus Christ.
It's the same unreasonable fear antigun people have about guns. Unless you're doing something stupid to put yourself in danger, the chances of you getting hit are miniscule...by lightning or a bullet.
Unless you're doing something stupid to put yourself in danger,
like ringing the wrong doorbell? Driving up the wrong driveway? letting a ball roll into your nieghbors yard? getting in the wrong car by accident? lol
or just going to work ...
I think anon was trolling or maybe retarded. I certainly hope it was one or the other. It's hard to tell in this clown world, sadly
All the old people who i knew 20 years ago in their 80s 90s, they all genuinely feared lightning like hell. The atmoshpere was probably a lot more active in the past century. When was the last time you've seen st. Elmo fire?
Yes, you can get struck by lightning doing all those things. If you're black, CNN will even accuse the lightning of being a far right extremist.
End your life
imagine being this cucked by your own retardation.
Not him but you're a nigger faggot and a woman
electionfags
thinking anyone else cares about them aside from recognizing the nuisance

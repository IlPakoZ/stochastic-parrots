Climb on
got all this for 500 nzd, 71 pieces
most of it without a scratch on it
nice score. If you don't already grab a nut tool for when those get welded in place
Is pic related climbable? Maybe too chossy?
already have one and also find it comes in handy for scraping out moss.
the big pile of rubble at the bottom is generally a red flag
i got these 23 cams for 500 from the same guy too.
was quitting climbing and selling his whole rack.
had another listing for 4 link cams and 3 other newer ones for 500 but didn't go for that one
If that is Devil's Tower it is climbable, also looks like a solid crack routes up it. 
only heard those are a gimmicky and not that practical
the thing that turned me off them was the rigid stem, not every crack is nice and vertical and having all your weight slam it down over an edge is sus
Yeah it is, you're right.
Link cams are heavy, single axle, and rigid stem so you wouldn't want a full rack of them. 
They really shine for building gear anchors because they fit anywhere. Most folks I know who have one will bring up either a single red or orange on multi pitch
Nice haul
hurt my left ringer finger awhile ago started feeling good enough to climb a little harder, now my right pinky is hurt. fml.
Hopped on the Nightcrawler (5.10+ 5p T) yesterday. This route is SICK! Almost sent it all clean until the real crux on p3 on a mantle ledge and then whipped like 4 times on the p4 laybacks. Hands and fingers were all churned up and bloody. It was a fuckin hoot. Getting more fun to try hard and send or whip; definitely growing as a climber. Maybe a year ago I’d still be a bit spooked to fall on gear. Now we’re rockin and rollin.
If you didn't know climbing was relocated to /xs/.
If you already knew then gl on your climbs OP.
I don't like this kind of vaguery.
Go on and fondle your plastic.
Anybody ever gone mountaineering? I went once and was bugged that we were "climbing" the mountain but it just felt like a hard hike.
"I-is that a wooden banana?"
I guess you pretty much have to pull it out at that point.
I’d say it’s really up in the air. I’d take 5.10c/d or even a soft 11a. Probably easiest to just call it “5.10+” but the best way for you to know is to go climb it :)
I’d like to go mountaineering, I guess the closest I’ve come is bear creek spire (5.3 alpine romp). I’m sure the bigger game is more mountaineering and technical climbing together. You’re at least out on a mountain!
But we go outside here
Not yet but that is the goal. I've done a few mountain hikes but have yet to have a true alpine experience. Winter skills and avalanche training will be necessary to make it as a mountaineer though
whats the best state for a climber?
stoked
Should I cut the cable on my picket?
Five years ago, sure. But this is nu-out now. It was over as soon as /out/ gave the archery, mountaineering, and climbing threads to /xs/.
post gear
How do you like those crack gloves? I'm trying to learn and the cracks out here can be grainy and quite painful.
Nice work my man. Gettin real jelly of all you manage to get up to.
Thanks bruh come out to Vegas and let’s climb sometime :D
I’ve got my ropes helmet and harnesses below this but I’m not letting you see the mess that is my room rn (I only clean it when babes come over, which is never)
The velcro strap is kind of annoying because you have to bend the rubber up and on cold days it doesn't want to cooperate. Otherwise, really solid glove stays in place, and just feels bomber. It does make your hand bigger so some jams you might not be able to get as deep as you would gloveless , and sometimes getting chalk is a hassle. 4/5
how do you feel about finger cracks?
Not too bad but sometimes not my favorite. Best is hand cracks… I imagine going to Mt. Olympus to climb 3000ft splitter hand cracks is what a climbers soul gets to enjoy when they pass on.
I ask because of the lonely blue totem up there lol
maybe because it's not an outdoor lifestyle thing and more sport
Brainlet take
could you live on a difficult inaccessible part of a mountain and do this to carry your supplies because i'd like to do that but you probably can't
Had kind of a crappy day testing out a new solo toprope setup, which is buggy, my pants were kind of thin and kept getting grabbed by the micro traxion(luckily it was the backup so I could unweight it easily). I did find a consolation prize of two well used cams so that was nice, who the hell leaves their anchors behind?
Thanks for the feedback, I have thin, bony hands and tape doesn't always cut it.
What was the setup? pic related is what i do usually
First I'm trying a single strand of rope, for the simplicity, then I'm using a roll-n-lock on the chest harness(up high like you have it) and the microtrax hanging from the waist on a short extension The greater distance between the devices makes it easier to ascend/descend with an aider but it also interferes with my legs so I'll have to keep it close like you have that black device, btw what is that? Also there were problems with the chest harness, one of which you have solved by having it straddle the micro trax like that. I'm also curious how you are wearing it, mine is awkward and yours probably is better.
The lower device is just a grigri as backup and so I don't have to change devices to lower myself. The chest harness is a 120cm sling with a twist in it for each arm and then overhand knots on sides to take up slack and keep the microtrax upright.
Yes I remember now from a previous post you made. I need to get a gri gri and that's a big advantage of two ropes although it looks like it adds some drag to the system. Next time out I'm going to try a single rope but with a TAZ Lov device up high which has very little drag so I can lower quickly without having to unweight anything or add something else. 
Have you tried solo lead yet? That's something I'm eager to do.
The grigri does add some drag, but it doesn't drag me like getting short roped would, it just doesn't feed through the device on it's own. If the route was longer I'd go single strand Y hang but it's pretty short so I just do a super 8 anchor. I'd love to try a TAZ Lov but it's pretty spendy for me to justify purchasing. I haven't tried lead solo yet but it's definitely on my radar, I got "Me, Myself &amp; I: The dark arts of big wall soloing by Andy Kirkpatrick" to read and also a nice pdf I'm trying to link but 4chan thinks its spam
Thanks for the tip on the book. I did the first test of single rope and TAZ Lov rig today on a vertical face.
My foot slipped while getting into a lieback over a small roof, totally unexpected and a free fall, it worked great and it was easy to just lower down and start again. There are some issues with it that you need to be aware of and compensate for before using it, having to do with lowering and also triggering the mechanism quickly, but overall I'm happy with it. Have fun out there.
lets see if this works because outside of watching a lot of videos this is the most info about rope soloing on sport routes. 
Very cool, thanks!
52 is a ripe old age for a wall pirate… Rest in Power Ammon McNeely
Why is this thread so slow, even for /out/? I know what will get some responses: I baton with pic related
Devils Tower is one of the best crack climbing spots in the world. Climbed the Durrance Route back in 2020, shit was the tits but it gets crowded. We started before sunrise, got to watch the rising sun burn the mist off the plains around the Belle Fourche River. Sounds of the cows mooing wafting up the tower. On the way down we rapped past a guided party, two sixty year old boomers with their 20s guide. "COME ON LARRY JUST PUT YOUR FOOT UP A FOOT COME ON COME ON" with close to forty people waiting for Larry to get to the ledge so they could pass them. Glad we got there early
Sounds like an amazing day. That guide probably should have given Larry some mechanical advantage
i found 2 really sick boulders accidentally while looking for a campsite, they look like the best in the area when comparing to all the ones i find online, gotta think up names for them and tell my friends :)
oh look, an overpriced pocket knife
What's your climbing knife of choice?
I keep a mora handy for clearing brush or general debris and I keep a Kershaw on cord clipped to my harness. I am a poorfag lol
if it works it works, I do have the petzl knife but I also get prodeals so it's less expensive and use it mostly for snacks lol
Great knife, cuts tomatoes like a charm
I've climbing more rock than you have sucked cock, i live in Font.
sure lmao
You fuckers shitting up the mountain sides and leaving your fucking anchors behinds should be shot
Where are you hiking that you even see anchors?(I'm assuming you aren't a climber)
NTA but the fact that you've never seen an anchor left behind makes me think you don't climb at all.
I've seen them left behind because I do climb and usually you can't see them unless you are climbing, which is why I'm asking. It's not like the side of a mountain is easily accessible
Also how does my question = I've never seen an anchor? Don't be such a fag anon.
I clean up old and worn out tats I find cause that's the right thing to do
One reason is because it wasn't linked in the last thread, and the name was changed to Climb General instead of Climbing General. I got lost for a while.
How did u put the mount on that hlmet
How many of you train fingers? I hurt a pulley got the third time in 2 years and I can only climb v6/5.11. I'm getting this feeling like I'm doing shit wrong when my friends are doing the same and harder shit no injuries. But they "just climb"
I'm stuck at that plateau and easing into 30min hangboard sessions to get past it, haven't had an injury yet knock on wood
Also you may be getting injured from projecting too often, mix in some easier endurance days and do prehab/rehab on that finger
Are you fat? Maybe try being less fat
Not him but what can you hang on, and how long? Are you as good on slopers as you are crimps?
Idk my max, I do sets of 10 second hangs on 20 and 15mm
And slightly better on crimps
Going to start hangboarding regardless to just see what happens. Plenty of injury recovery plans out there to follow. Glad to hear someone's thinking about it.
I'm 6' 170lbs
should i buy shoes even if im pretty new if i want to climb outside early? want to get more into crack climbing and my gym dosent have anything to simulate it while there are crack boulders near me outside
This place is a ghost town, usually there would be a new one a day after the old thread archives but /out/ is the forgotten board of some mod
cleaned with alcohol then attached the included mount. It's just glue but it's been solid.
Yes, I learned outside then climbed at gyms, you can climb outside whenever you want. If you are bouldering I'd get a crash pad, usually someone has one they don't use and want to get rid off on offerup or FB market.
Just climb. If your fingies hurt, use the rice bucket.
Training for climbing defeats the purpose for me it's supposed to be fun. I lead 5.10 sport outside v3 boulders 5.6 trad and that's good enough for me. 
Recognize your physical limitations - the average person can climb 5.12/v7 if they train, but that's about it. If you're not genetically gifted to climb, don't bang your head against a wall. Climbing is just a farce anyway.
Climbing hard is fun for me, I like to train to get stronger so I can climb harder(more fun) things.
Eat a sandwich or ten, you spooky doot doot motherfucker
No matter what level you're at, there's a hard climb available, so i don't see your point.
You probably haven't reached your physical limit on climbing but seems like you've mentally stopped yourself. Of course there will always be a hard climb available, don't you see the thrill in that, that's what we train for. If you climb at a popular crag you will also note that there usually isn't a line for the 5.13
i just jump off stuff/things
You climb in Vegas often?
I was there for the first time ever in January and it rained the whole time. We climbed limestone.
I'll definitely be back.
Vegas or Reno? I was thinking about moving out for the climbing and I hear the hospitality industry has a strong union out there.
Hard is just relative to your skill level. You're just ego climbing
You mean you rappel off things. Dan Osman jumped off things :)
breh.
I know climbers are friendly but fuck, I just want to be alone. I doubt she likes me or something, it's just so uncomfortable having a girl of that caliber showing off her body that close to me.
absolutely godawful post anon, keep it up
what happened
whatever makes you feel better man, just don't limit others because you've limited yourself.
you should continue to post for attention here and fuck your life up more
I'm not discouraging you from training, i just think it's boring as shit. If you want to grind all the time like Andrew Tate or something that's fine, but the best climber is the one having the most fun.
at least we can agree on that
aren't those like $40?
I want to get into canyoneering and someone told me to self teach. I have practically 0 climbing experience, only really familiar with rappelling on a rescue 8. I've got 200 feet of dynamic rope, some 1" webbing carabiners, and a couple locking carabiners. I know I need a bunch of other shit but I have no clue where to start and have no friends who climb
Im also terrified of falling to my death by self teaching. Any tips on where to start?
Anyone going to the red in March? Going March 17-19, wonder if I’ll see any of you fuckers at Miguels

Excellent life choice anon, canyoning is rad.
Where do you live? Do you want to get into Swiftwater wet canyons or dry slotty canyons? Based on you calling it 'canyoneering' I'm guessing southwest USA so dry canyons. This will determine the type of techniques and gear you need to acquire and learn, there is some crossover but also some differences.

Dynamic rope
No
Fig8 rapping
Yes
Carabiners
Yes
Yes
Honestly anon your best move is to find a professional guide/instructor or a group of experienced competent canyoners who would be willing for you to tag along and learn from them. To not be a liability/passenger in a canyon skills/experience you will need: anchor finding and building, both natural (trees, boulders, cracks etc) and bolts (often sketchy), rope management and rappel rigging for both raising and lowering a stuck rappeller, single and double rope ascent techniques, rappelling on often very slippery surfaces, sometimes directly in the flow of powerful waterfalls, whitewater swimming techniques, jumping + sliding in to water from 5m+ heights, climbing to reach anchors with minimal protection and lots of exposure, downclimbing with consequential falls, off track navigation. It's very much a team sport so learning by yourself will be tricky and limiting.
All that said though, the combination of all of those skills/requirements means it's a rad sport and extremely fun.
I rappelled this 75m waterfall recently. The fall line goes right though the main flow. It was super intense and awesome.
t. NZ canyoner, got into the sport from climbing/hiking/whitewater kayak background
Another pic from most recent trip
I'm in Tucson, AZ. Tho I'm moving to Phoenix in a few months when I graduate.
Is dynamic really that bad? I've been told and understand that static is better if you're primarily rapping though everything I find online says dynamic is fine. What should I do with this rope if not? It's brand new never been used Sterling 9.8mm. Admittedly, my dad brought all this shit out last year for a camping trip to Southern Utah as a "just in case" and just left it all with me. But I'm not gonna complain too much about free rope, could I find a local place to possibly trade it for some shit/static I need?
Not really looking for a whole lot of swimming yet, though I'm fine with wading as long as I can mostly touch the bottom. We hiked Golden Cathedral last year and my bucket list is to do Neon Canyon for the final rappel through the roof
We've got a climbing gym here in town and I want to ask them for direction for finding canyoneering people, but I feel like they're just gonna sell me a membership and then never point me in the right direction/introduce me to people. Literally the only experience I have is rapping on rescue 8s when I got a crash course in it as a firefighter over a decade ago, but I've seen enough YouTube videos to confidently kill myself.
I'll probably pay the $250 for the half day guided trip just so I can meet someone who also does it
Cool. You can rap on a dynamic rope but all the bouncing when rapping sucks and if you're in a soft rock canyon it will rapidly cut grooves into the rock and will also wear though the sheath which then ruins the rope. Pulling down a dynamic rope from a big pitch also sucks especially if it's a hard pull down or there are lots of potential snags. All your effort just goes to stretching the rope instead of actually getting it down.
Check out www.canyoncollective.com they have a decent forum on there with mostly SW USA based canyoneers. There are lots of grumpy old men but they know their shit and you may find someone willing to let you tag along on a trip. You'll need a harness, double cowstail lanyard, several carabiners and rappel device, helmet, sturdy backpack as a minimum to join a group on a trip. There are bound to be Facebook canyoneer groups too which you can probably find a group willing to let you join a trip.

Wouldn't be a bad start as far as gear goes, maybe see if a local climbing club has a canyon course. Climbing gyms also have bulletin boards you can check out and FB as well. Static ropes are like a third the price of dynamic ropes, the one you have sounds really good tho I'd hold onto it and try to get into climbing as well, a lot of the same skills overlap between the two
Weather has been so fucking ass here in Vegas but it’s clearing up. Gonna hit up winter heat wall to do “Couldn’t be Schmooter” and “High Class Ho.” Tomorrow I’m taking a buddy up Jackass Flats and hopefully Diet Delight, too. Excited to get back out there, need to give snowboarding a few days break haha. Hope y’all have been sending.
Vegas is infinitely better than Reno except for the proximity to Tahoe, truckee and donner. Besides that, Reno is a shithole that reminds me of jail.
learn how to rotate ur images
I've walked and scrambled up plenty of mountains but nothing near me really requires any technical skill to climb, I'd like to do some proper mountaineering but I'd need to travel abroad for it.
do your mountains have snow?
Only in winter, none of them are very high up.
it was rotated when I looked at it before posting ;_; 
Here's a different trip where we were practice rigging a Tyrolean traverse
Any good info on how to rig one? i've tried looking them up and just see people using them but not rigging them. pic related is what I'd like to do in order to avoid the hike lol
Anon, I think you'll still need someone to make the hike to the other side first
I mean on the descent after topping out. Now any suggestions?
It's a difficult choice.
but isn't reno cheaper to live?
If you wanna live in NV live in Vegas it's the only non-shithole in that entire blasted state
To say Vegas is a slightly better shithole is more accurate. But if variety in your climbing is a goal, Reno hands down. >Year round climbing that’s not a million degrees.
Not a hard decision.
Do any of you guys do rope access work? I was thinking about getting qualified since it seems like a decent excuse to work outdoors and travel on the job.
just walk up the side you fucking retard
faggots like you who bring their poor dogs up to places like this unironically need to get killed. kill yourself manlet/twink.
At first, when I started doing some indoor climbing in college at the rec center to work on forearm strength/hit on the weird sluts there, I didn't understand why it is full of weird little turbo manlets and extreme lanklets. But then I realized it is one of the "sports" designed just for you and your unfortunate bodies. Keep acting like weirdos you autistic fuckers
lmao anybody can climb there is no limiting factor except whatever limits you put on yourself. nice cope tho
Canyon rigging for a Tyrolean may different to climbing because we always have to be able to retrieve from the bottom. Basically though - first person raps normally and finds bottom anchor point. Seconder then block the rope at halfway against the anchor ring at the top of the pitch with a clove hitched biner or similar. Bottom rigger then tensions up with a figure 8 in self locking mode and a 3:1 on the tail with ascender/tibloc as rope grab. Then seconder + others can slide down the taut line on a biner or pulley with the loose side of the rope running through their belay device to control speed. Once everyone is down the pitch, release tension on the locked figure 8 and remove from rope. Then pull down the other loose rope end which was blocked against th anchor. You should have all your gear at the base of the pitch ready to move to the next. Hopefully that made sense I don't have any detailed pics or vids of rigging one up
It all makes sense I just set up a little mock up in my room except what is the rope grab attached to that's on the tail. 
I'd like to do it to get from one side to another at the same height. In climbing there would probably be bolts and rings I could thread the rope through so I wouldn't need a biner block, but I would need to have one side anchored in and then figure out how to tension the rope.
Anyone here familiar with climbing in Kentucky? How is Red River gorge?
There’s a ramp literally to the right that bypasses the entire first pitch lol. The dog walked up it and I clipped him to some ancient chains on a ledge. Sorry my 5.dog buddy climbs harder than you
I need to buy gear for outdoor climbing, tired of having to bum off of friends. What rope to buy? I want to do mostly single pitch, but also some multi pitch and mountaineering with glacier crossings. Can one rope do it all, or do I have to drop half a salary on 3 different ropes? I was hoping I could buy something like a 9.5mm 70m single rope and call it a day. Thoughts?
Get it dry treated and you're good to go. Might get a little cumbersome on mountaineering trips but otherwise solid choice.
It's the best sport climbing area in the entire United States
Anyone else here exclusively use chains?
Yeah that's what I was thinking. Probably suboptimal for some applications but fuck buying 15 different ropes
Heading to S AZ to try to catch the last of the cool weather. Better late than never. Hopefully find some nice walls before it gets too warm
you will hate yourself bringing a huge rope like that for glacier travel
Can I climb by myself with a rope? I want to start climbing but I'm too autistic to socialize and would like to climb by myself. Is it possible? I don't want to climb completely ropeless, I want to still be able to use my gear, but just not have someone with me. Is it possible, bros?
So, Bosi has gotten a head start on the illusive finnish autism test piece. Who will be next to join the struggle?
Hard to imagine anyone else with the self-hatred to get on this miserable rock. I think he's been working the indoor replica with Stefano Ghisolfi though.
If you don't know the answer, then No.
Yeah, Aidan Roberts probably scanned the holds just to satisfy his board climbing fetish I'm sure.
what's your typical glacier travel rope?
I use a 50m beal opera, even that is kinda overkill. A lot of people will just use a 30m rope.
Every day we stray further from nalles light
Pebble wrestling autism never ceases to amaze
Amen, brother. Dark times. Next step is to build a large tent/light warehouse around a boulder to negate weather.
Haha, yeah...
So you haven't started climbing yet but want to jump into the most niche and complicated style of climbing? Just go boulder if you want to climb alone
bump
She cut mass on her legs for extra reach.
That would be KD
Just because you are shaped like a fridge doesn't mean you can't climb, nice cope tho
any other tower dogs?
Guy in your pic is cancer I hope that's not you
A better role model for the more stout among us would be John Dunne, the fat crusher. Watch Hard Grit if you haven’t, it’s great.
If you do them in the summer, they are all just hikes, nothing above class 4.
Point is anyone can climb. The original anon probably thinks the only reason he can't climb the nose is because he isn't as small as Lynn Hill or he his pointer finger is weighing him down
No I'm going at the end of may. How was it?
There's so little interest in the rock itself from rockclimbers.
There's still no good reason explaining the reason for the different features on different rock types, or within the same rocktype (e.g. why's sandstone in tennessee so different from the one in font?), etc.
Sure, I don't expect pros to be interested in anything other than pulling hard (and solar panels) but with the amount of nerds into the sport, I'd think we'd have a fair amount of resources on the subject.
Yeah, everytime I start nerding about rock types and rock quality I can see the fellow climbers get that glazed look like they are somewhere else. I fucking love that shit, it's so facinating what mother nature has created through rather violent means.
anyone have experience climbing in serbia, specifically around belgrade? thinking of taking a contract to work there this summer. gym recs would be good too looks like they got a couple nice ones in the city
Any of you spergs from Boulder? Headed out there in a week or so and want to know what's good and if it will be covered in fucking snow or not.
should I try Burden of Dreams?
I'm pretty autistic, and pretty sure I'm better than any britbong out there.
The differences in granite all throughout California is fascinating. Yosemite and shuteye are right next to each other and one is all cracks and slab and the other is these huge patina plates. Same with Mt woodson granite vs black mountain in so Cal. I would love to read about why but can't find resources
Love those giant cams. What am I looking at here, some kind of funky belay device?
forgot the pic related
buying rope for my first outdoor climbs (TR)
what length/width should I get?
Anyone climbed at vedauwoo in WY before? Any decent top rope routes to recommend?
Remember when mountainproject was cool? Burchey was a funny motherfucker.
I'm climbing new routes in Cochise. There is a green cinch in that stash
MP was never cool. RC.com used to be
When I see chalk on rock I take out my hammer and go to work
There's nothing you can do to stop me you Filthy city dwellers shitting up my rural mountains with pot head dirtbags and yuppie liberals.
Some of the megathreads on Supertopo were quite entertaining. Valley climbers would throw blows over the removal/replacement of a rusty 1/4" expansion bolt, or yo-yoing, or using a stick clip on aid routes.
There’s plenty of geology in the old school resources. I even became a geologist (graduate this semester!) because of climbing. One of my old professors was a valley rat in the 70s too. A lot of folks are just there because it’s the hip new way to be outdoors. Some people genuinely just don’t care, and are in it for the upvotes or something. Oh well, more rock for me to ponder on.
I've lately seens this retarded trolling multiple times in different places. Either it's one autist looking for attention or some group of losers think they are edgy.
edginess aside his point is valid, climbers have become consoomers
What's your favorite rock type and why?
Fuck yeah
Georgia Southern Cross in Atl and another out of Lincoln, Nebraska called Capital Tower.
Fucking love to paint them ...... big mitten in one hand, Petzl Stop in the other on the handle brake....3 gal on my hip.....
Nothing beats that job in the world....Builds are fun and simple....antenna mounts are a bitch to lift to the apex of a Self-Supported Tower, but rigging coax is certainly a beastly gig.
You know this is the best employment ever for a climber....beats any ground work around.
My first test climb was over 1000' on the top of the steel of the Nations Bank building in Atl.....the biggest building in the Southeast.
Got to hit the ladder up to the gold flake covered lightning rod pillar on top....fucking amazing job but they get some pretty awnry guys on the gigs sometimes....
Those companies I worked for before the regulations got too stiff and climbing harnesses were thrown out for the shitty cant-self-rescue-full body harnesses that leave you dangling like an idiot if you lose your footing....
One slip and they have to call in a rescue team....we all agreed to throw them out for Petzl Navajos and Black Diamond Bod harnesses.
There were a ton of climbers with us but also road dogs that were just fearless and after high paying work...can't blame them.
Watching 250 lb guys try to ladder all day was kinda funny as I was in at 180 max.

Central Serbia is not the best location for climbing, but surprisingly, there are a few "crags" inside Belgrade
https://serbianclimbing.com/penjalista/prirodna/
Probably sandstone at this point. It’s what I mostly climb on and it holds a lot of data in regards to zircons, dating, sedimentation rates, etc. The structures it makes are beautiful too. Love a good desert tower or big wall. I do love some good alpine granite though, that shit is just plain badass.
thanks for the info. is it necessary to use the Micro Traxion, or will any simple pulley do? if i understood correctly the purpose is to manage rope slack only
It's purpose is to capture your progress as you climb. Its a one way entrance for the rope so if you were to fall it'd be the same as falling on TR. You wouldn't want to use a simple pulley because it won't stop the rope from flying through the device. I like the micro traxion because it's familiar but any progress capture pulley/ascender would work. I've heard good stuff about the Roll n Lock from CT and the Taz LOV2
I was interested in picking up the hobby but do crackers turn into niggas after they start climbin' ?
is 27crags worth it?
Was looking for a topo of Alcaniz and got scammed into buying "boulder en espana", which only has a shitty 4 page overview of the area and also it's all in spanish...
It's very convenient but I live in Finland. 27crags is a finnish company and started here so it covers most of the stuff you'll find here. The general atmosphere towards accuracy also means you don't have to second-guess when you get to the crag.
i really hate that my local climbing club paints the topo locations on the rock itself, i dont see the point when they release the topos for free online for most crags too
where's the tarp?
Hope somebody cleaned that shit away. Usually when you run into tarp contraption in a forest there's a drunken hobo around somewhere.
bouldering then free solo
Anyone know where I can watch Hard Grit (1998)? or should i just buy the DVD?
4chan removes exif data on posting, which includes the rotation data. rotate, then crop.
west Cochise Stronghold seems to be the go-to for out-of-towners but Mt. Lemmon has year round climbing.
Nice. crag has very short walls though, 10-15m but good routes and cracks
anyone projecting anything fun this spring? it wont stop snowing here
are there any alternatives to thecrag.com that don't require you to login? and that let you download the pictures and routes
[Autistic reeeeing]
60m 9.6-10mm
Nothing. It won't stop raining here
Are there brands of rock climbing shoe to avoid?
Having trouble with skin. Using antihydral seems to just build up an additional layer over the top instead of actually thickening it? Any tips?
mountain project?
I can just go to a climbing gym and start with bouldering right? I don't need any training until I do shit with belays or whatever right?
yup simple as that. If by training you mean like learning how to use the belay devices/rope than yeah you don't need to know that for bouldering.
thanks i like that site much better, but apparently nobody uses it in my country, it has very few routes. i think i will spend some money on a book
yeah thats much better than buying a subscription for topos like 27crags since it supports the guys that maintain the crags too
next piece of gear i want to buy is thin rope (don't know the name in english), the kind you use to make prusiks or machards. my understanding is that it's supposed to be thin but not very much, at least 6mm, is this correct?
should this kind of rope be static, or dynamic? i hear that people also use it in mountaneering, but i it only for rappel? if so it should be static, right? any info about all of this in general would be helpful
Here it's called cordelette or accessory cord
For friction hitches it should be ~3mm smaller diameter than the climbing rope
7mm is most common and can also be used for anchors or whatever you want really
Usually sold by the foot or 30ft lengths in the US, not sure how you guys do it in metric lol
Some 6mm cord should do you just fine for this purpose, I use this one and it’s fine for anchors, PAS and prussik
Making some heavy moves towards going outdoors with my climbs, primarily top rope on natural and bolt anchors. I'll be out at Joshua Tree in a few weeks so looking to shore up gaps in knowledge before then. 
I have a question about setting up a quad on bolts for TR. Is a single bowline + runner + stopper knot sufficient to safely approach the bolts and continue with set-up? I've anchored into the single bowline when the second anchor point wasn't in within a safe distance and to the double bowline when they were safely away from the cliff (both for setting up natural anchors) but I imagine the bolts could vary in accessibility. Should I play it safe and just do two anchor points and hook into the double bowline just for safety? If it's not clear, this is all in reference to safely approaching bolts to set up a quad for TR.
3 years of autobelay and top rope falls has caused some fraying on my harnesses waist strap
Should I worry yet?
J Tree is gonna be hot as FUCK and I have no idea what you are talking about. Just do pic related if you’re gonna do a quad. For TR set ups I would just make a normal overhand as your master point, throw a locker or 2 in and go. Can you maybe use English or draw me a picture? I can help you further if I understand just what the fuck you’re saying.
Also: http://multipitchclimbing.com/
I haven't been but j tree is a bad place to do what you described, as there aren't many natural features on the top outs
Here's a pic of where they recommend beginners go, and idk what you would tie off to unless you build an anchor with cams
Maybe crawl on your stomach or pay someone a couple bucks to set it up for you
You should get a new one soon. I was in the same place about 6 months back and the belay loop gave out almost entirely when I took a fall on autobelay. If it’s been three years you’ve probably gotten your money’s worth easy
Alright, let me put it more simply. I've never set up a quad before for TR, only natural anchors. You can tether into your anchors as you set up so you can safely approach the edge and send down your rope. where do you tether for setting up a quad? Where are those bolts typically located? Over the edge? Right at the top? How do I safely approach? 
also is pic related fine for a quad?
Most people scoot or crawl to the bolts with no tether 
They are usually in a relatively safe spot if they were bolted with top roping in mind which you will have to research and find out which ones are beforehand
You pic is fine and you should connect the ends with a double fisherman's knot
Just slap your PAS into the bolt hanger and put your anchor on the bolt. Connect the bolts. Connect a sling to you and then to the anchor. Move the PAS (if you want). Continue setting up the anchor.
Sometimes the bolts aren't set up for TR and in that case you'll have to either down climb with a belay, be lowered, or rap to the bolts. If this is the case you'll most likely find rings or quick links on the bolts; try like hell not to TR on these. Use leaver biners instead of a quad if you think it'll be a major hassle to get to the anchor, i.e., nobody in your party can do the climb and you don't have the time to climb around to the top and repeat the down climb/lowering/rap process. Or just use a shit ton of webbing or another rope to extend a natural anchor over the edge.
it is but it's also cumbersome, a 240cm sling like >>2567356 is easier to deploy
just rap off a natural anchor (tree, BIG rock) to the real anchor, clip your PAS to the anchor, then proceed to build your quad/whatever and put your rope trough it.
Let Bob tell you more:

Climbing?
Climbing!
He sent it boyos
thank you based anons if I am alive I'll post photos
Elaborate.
Nalle sent it the ol fashioned way
Will sent it after training on a 3d scanned indoor replica rigged to a weighted pulley system
Brings up arguments about the autistic deconstruction of the sending process
"If he flashed it irl would it have been a flash?" Etc
one more thing -- most joshua tree routes don't have bolted anchors, and a lot of the ones that do don't have a safe way to set up a TR. research the shit out of the routes you plan to do
The autismal process strays far from pure climbing in my 5.11 climber opinion hah. It's like these guys are about media appeal more than wanting to climb.
To be fair, Nalle did replica training during bad weather/off-season but he just used generic climbing holds.
Gratz to Will, that crazy scotish bastard.
Very autistic question
But how do you meet climbing friends? Someone told me it's pretty easy to find people at a climbing gym, but how do you generally approach that kinda thing without coming across as a weirdo?
I can't really go trad climbing without a partner to belay, right?
They probably climb more than you. Besides, can you blame them? They have responsibilities to sponsors regarding the media appeal. Its the age we live in. Its the only way for them to do this full time. Not even the competitions pay as well as.they used to 10-15 years ago.
Replicas have been a thing for decades. What? Its a crime to train now? Every craft or elite activity involves practice. Regardless of the sport, deconstructing things to make it easier, simpler and efficient improves performance. You make no sense.
try talking about a boulder when you see someone doing it, or when you are doing one and you see somebody looking at you doing it. like "dayum that starting position is weird as fuck" or "hey do you think you are supposed to skip that hold over there" or whatever that makes sense. then you try to keep a conversation going.
if you have problems talking with people in general, it will also be difficult meeting climbing friends at the gym, and the other way around
Sure, I got you back anon. Here are some practical liners you could to use in almost any situation:
Hope this helps
you don't have to do anything most of the time.
if you go to a gym regularly enough, people will approach you, just be open enough to keep the conversation going once they initiate.
Friendly reminder to climb local and be a steward of your own land.
These are great, I'll definitely use them (in a gym I'm never visiting again)
Ok. Last one.
wanna get into multipitch climbing, dont want to gearfag but can someone check if im missing anything for my list to buy for extended rappel for it?
2x 120cm sling, one for the extended rappel and one as anchor or foot sling if i need to ascend
1x atc guide
1x hms carabiner (already have another one)
4x smaller screw lock carabiners
1x 50cm rope for prussik as third hand, will probably just get a pre-sewn one
friend will be buying the same stuff, anything else i should get for backup like a 2nd prussik rope or extra sling also?
I’d probably just throw in an extra sling and 2 carabiners and you’d be totally set
Dude. You're gearfagging and you'll load yourself down with unnecessary weight. You have a rack, right? And on that rack you have a belay/rappel device and a locker, right? And you've practiced rappelling and ascending a rope with prussik loops or slings or your shoelaces or whatever, right? Because if you've practiced that shit, which you should've by now if you're thinking about multi pitch routes, you already have a couple slings or prussik loops and maybe a couple lockers which is everything you need. Oh wait, you don't even own a belay/rappel device? Ok, gotcha. Find some rock, learn how to build anchors, do some toproping off those anchors, and by that time you'll have everything you need to rappel. Then practice rappelling and prussiking.
thanks i think i will get an extra prusik rope too for backup but from accessory cord so its cheaper, will get the backup carabiner and sling though, do you think its worth getting a 240cm sling for an anchor like in >>2567356 also? 
sorry >.&lt;
i only have single pitch sports climbing gear thats why im buying these things, i currently belay with a single rope passive belay device (singing rock rama) but i can belay with an atc i just dont have one lol
theres a really good spot in my area to practice rappelling on so i will practice it there, just wanted to double check if i was missing anything
nta, but if it's a bolted multipitch then yes because you can tie it before even climbing and have it ready to go at every station. I like a 180cm sling for the same thing and it doesn't hang down as low.
I got bored and laid out your proposed rap rack. I also included a locker for the ATC and my proposed extra sling and 2 biners. You will also be using a locker for the prussik when it is in use, but it can be stored on its own locker or with the ATC. In all, I think you have too much gear for rappelling, but that’s a bonus and with more experience you will be able to pare your rack down a bit.
To count:
You could probably get away with less lockers, honestly. I hope this helps, and let me know if you make any adjustments and I’ll try to lay it out for you.
Based thanks, i think i only need minimum 6 lockers right? i can use the carabiners on my quickdraws in an emergency so maybe the extra ones are not necessary anyways, but i think i will bring them at first.
is using another locker to hold the others only to save space on the harness?
also dyneema slings seem to be just slightly more expensive than nylon so is there any reason to not get them? also im not sure how much use i would get out of the 60cm sling compared to another 120cm though
The lockers clipped to the one locker is just so it doesn’t look so cluttered. But yes, you can clip lockers together to save space. A racked climbing harness is very dynamic in how it is set up, with constant shuffling and moving, so one load out may not always be the same the whole climb. This isn’t a video game, this is real life. I just use dyneema because that’s what my shop sells. Nylon is fine too, but a little bulkier. Use whatever you get, it all works if it’s rated. I hawk it all the time, but https://multipitchclimbing.com is an absolute gem of a website. Do some reading! Get whatever sizes of slings you want, I get a lot of use out of shoulder-length (60cm?) slings. I usually keep a 240cm, a 120cm and a ton of 60cm on my rack for trad days. You can always tie stuff together. Pic related is a 2pc anchor I made on the first pitch of Olive Oil from a nut and #1 cam I reslung with accessory cord. Girth hitch master point and 60cm sling w/ carabiners. Bomb proof (well, a third piece would make it a bit more textbook).
Any 'normal' multipitch maneuver (even anchor transfer on weighted rope) is achievable with max 4 lockers and 3-4 carabiners. 
Since you're a beginner, carry a spare locker just in case, but 6+ is waay too much.
60cm Dyneema is great for making quickdraws, it's also lighter and more easily manipulable compared to nylon. Just be aware that due to the lower melting point, you shouldn't be making any knots that'll get shock loaded with it. 
As for long slings, my go-to is 120cm kevlar for anchor/rap and 180cm nylon for extended anchors/pulleys. 
Also, I recommend carrying ~5m of 6mm rope for abseil anchors, prussiking up the rope, etc.

Knife general thread, knives actually made for use in the outdoors edition. Office workers who've only ever cut cardboard/paper need not apply
BPS Adventurer. Great knife, and because they are made in Ukraine I suspect they are being subsidized for export so they are available far cheaper than they should be. For $40 you get a quality knife, very quality sheath, and ferro rod.
Looks nice, though the stand with ukraine shit on their site is gay and their use of 1066 instead of something similar to 1095 is questionable on their smaller fixed blades
Never been to their website, bought off Amazon cheap and will do so until Wagner storms their factory and loots all the goods.
their use of 1066 instead of something similar to 1095 is questionable
I mean sure, but I doubt any human being would be able to tell a 1060 knife from 1095 knife after a day of slicing wood or whatever. 10XX steel doesn't matter on a bush knife, it matters on a chef knife or a thin sword.
The main difference is in toughness and edge retention. And while you can't really tell the toughness of a knife until you eventually break it, the difference between edge retention becomes apparent when you use em for a bit. Even with 1075 you'll find yourself having to touch up the edge more often than 1095, and while that's a worthwhile trade-off when it comes to larger knives, it's wasted on smaller ones
10XX steel doesn't matter on a bush knife, it matters on a chef knife or a thin sword.
How exactly? Also who uses 10 series carbon steels for kitchen knives?

Fucking hate how big the handles are on Mora's. I returned like 3 of them.
For me? It's the Buck 110 and Gerber Asada, and pic related for actual/out/ activity
Ask me how I know you use the wrong tool for the job, for everything
Are you one of those types that avoids using knives at any cost just to prove a point?
Fucking hate how big the handles are on Mora's. I returned like 3 of them.
Really? I find em quite comfy, and I wear medium sized gloves. Plus them being a little oversized is a good thing for when you use em with thick gloves on. To each their own though, no problem with not being a fan of budget swedish knives
For me? It's the Buick Lesabre and Carne Asada, and pic related for actual/out/ activity
what is the blurry pic related? did it come in a box of swiss miss
Tiny hands typed this post
Does Mora still make the model with the ferro rod in the handle? or has it been discontinued
Fucking hate how big the handles are on Mora's
For me? It's the Buck 110
Pretty much the same size handle lmao
got a victorinox forester, basically the same thing - absolutely love it for an outdoors knife. can't say i've ever had an issue with the handle size on moras, fits my medium hands absolutely fine and probably more comfortable than most other knives. 
got a bk10 as well, works well as a knife but i'm not sure about the handles and the sheath isn't great but strapped onto a pack it's not a huge deal.
I've got a kydex sheath and micarta handles on mine. It's worth it if you use it a lot. You can get them on Amazon. They have g10 handles as well.
my gf got me this for christmas
i don't know much about outdoors but it's great tool for blue-collar workers, will buy more in the future
why would you ever use one of those instead of a utility knife in blue collar work?
You should have at least 17 Mora Companionas
i still use utility knives or light tasks, thankfully i don't live in pansy country where people would get arrested for carrying bigger blade
Not all work is amazon cardboard boxes
Well aware, unfortunate tradie here.
Leatherman Skeletool is all you need
Quite literally one of the worst leathermans to date, basically any other option from them would be better suited to outdoors use
Grohmann #2 "Bird and Trout"
Stainless steel, Canadian made!
I like Moras, they're all over the place here. Also have a couple of service Khukuris, a Gerber LMF, Cold Steel Bushman, a few hand forged pieces and a fairly practical viking Saex.
coincidentally i have a barely used #2 in the mail which i plan to use for... bird and trout
tell me about it anon
Choils are retarded.
That is all.
Goodbye.
One these has been my pocket knife for 20 years
What the hell happened to the handles? I understand it being dirty/damaged to a degree (especially in a construction site), but some of those look genuinely chewed up
how are winkler knives?
This beautiful thing just arrived. Terävä Jääkäripuukko 110.
Maybe he was pretending to be a pirate, climbing the rigging to tell Peter Pan that he doesn't really go /out/
yes
Toughness is defined in ASTM D5801-12. The main contributors to Toughness are material type and annealing method. Edge retention is mostly a byproduct of hardness--ASTM E18-22. Both toughness and hardness should be consistent by manufacturer--zero guess work.
Fun fact--most knife manufacturers use what is cheap and easy to make not what is best... for example you don't see a lot of stainless knifes from custom knife makers because it is much harder to work with and the annealing is more difficult--not because it isn't superior to carbon steel. The carbon steel my persists because it is easier for noobs to sharpen.
my bad
Stainless > carbon
There is another MUCH more expensive method to manufacture stainless using an atomization process but I can't remember the process name.
Powder metallurgy?
Honesty, not to sound like a fluff, but it is so comfy, and ergonomic. Lots of different holdings. My buddy who is an avid moose hunter says it would would lovely on moose. I've just use her on trout... hopefully rabbit (hare) and grouse soon.
expensive but from what i've seen breddy gud
Based, I just recently gave that same model to my friend
do you like it? I'm torn between the 140 and the 110. I've heard they feel a little flimsy
I literally just got it, but for now it feels really good at hand.
140 and the 110
I had this doubt too, no regrets until now. I guess the 140 would feel clumsier with the blade length.
flimsy
Definitely not, it seems really sturdy for now. But again, I'll only have an actual opinion as soon as I take it /out/ with me.
Based trash enjoyer
Why trash?
i picked it up today, feels nice in the hand but looks nothing fancy. definitely made to be used. my gf remarked it looked like an old timey letter opener haha
Because Varusteleka is the top retailer, and they gargle Zelensky's balls.
Yeah, I don't care. It doesn't affect the product. I wouldn't remain from buying something good because of politics.
Because you have a really, really small dick
/lgbt
from a practical view point, the 1066 is tougher than 1095, heat treated to the same hardness the 1066 will bend where the 1095 would break, though the 1095 will hold an edge longer than the 1066, both are practical steels and easy to sharpen in the field should it become necessary. 
For the money it's a fine knife.
I use the small Esee instead of the box cutter because the sheath is less noticeable on my belt, no folding or opening like a utility knife, and it takes a good edge and holds it for awhile while box cutters are super super sharp and will slice the tip of your finger off before they’re completely dull and useless 5min later. Esee also makes a decent small pry bar or spudger when needed and box cutters snap.
Indeed, if you need a large blade to open boxes... You probably belong there.
It's still just a compensation for a tiny penis.
Yeah, grohmann's are a true woodman's knife; known as the canadian belt knife. The 2 does have a old timey letter opener vibe though haha I'll have to use mine on that, along with the trout! Hope you enjoy her!
The tiny knife that is smaller than the box cutter?
What you have to realize, is just how small that guys dick really is. It's basically a clitoris with a urethra routed through it.
I took the ESEE pill, since you liked it so much, but I found the candiru just a bit too small. I basically use the Izula or a spyderco, depending on if I'm at work or not. (I work in the federal govt and the spyderco is less likely to get me questioned, since it's less visible stowed.)
works for the fed

Anyone have a brisa nessmuk? How do you like it?
Yes, you sexually inadequate man child. LMAO
i have one, its WAY too thick for that blade shape, if it was half as thick it would be greatly improved
What's a good, EDC knife? Mainly for traveling and some light outdoor work. Should come with a sheet. Eyeing some Morakniv on Amazon rn.
See >>2553739
Also I use the Candiru because I’m working around normies all day and the thing hides in the palm of my hand. If it were a straight up fishing knoife, I would carry something like the Esee 3 or 5 or whatever smaller than Rambo knoife.
Spyderco
Every one of those I see must be some factory seconds because they have a big hole in the blade.
Knoif's 'n sheet.
Spooky, those are both of my primary knives.
The Buck knife was probably the best purchase I've ever made in terms of knives. That was over a decade ago.
I'm thinking about getting a buck; I like the concept of the 102 for small game, but the 119 seems neat. What do you use it for, anon?
What do you use it for
Everything up to an including opening cans. It's never lost an edge. It's pretty fucking amazing.
Sweet. I kinda want one... even just for the meme. Thanks anon!
Fun fact, the official Danish scout knife, is pretty much a copy of the Buck, a little shorter, without the fuller or more "combat knife type guard"
and a slightly thinner blade, its called a Vangedal if anyone would be interested in that
grandpa had one, mom had one, now i have all of them, good times
they do have this weird thing, where there is a rifle stud on the belt loop, that goes into the handle, on the other side of the snap you can see in the front on some models
Thanks, brudder! They actually seem awesome. Aesthetic and functional. I'll check them out for sure. Thanks for the tip!
look into their Senior models, or the Rover
but im pretty sure they are unobtainium outside Denmark, here you can see the hole the stud in the sheath fits into, never seen that on any other knife, also, they are intentionally made with pretty poor "quality" leather, not that its even close to bad, but its leather that is meant for you to treat it, leather fat, leather fat, leather fat, until it goes naturally brown unlike many modern dyed leather sheaths, which is kinda refreshing, this makes me wanna buy a new one too and actually take care of it!
Ah, yeah and I'm I'm Canada, the land of...yeah. You never know, anon; I have cousins in Denmark, I've been meaning to visit for a long time.
I'm I'm Canada
I've been meaning to visit for a long time.
please do, we have unironically nice places here, old towns, gently rolling roads, our forrests are probably the size of a small back yard in Canada, but if you can rent a boat and travels the coast? 10/10 
ive been wanting to go to Canada too for a long time, but if i was to do it, the travel time, would have to be less then the time actually spent there.

Yeah, I live in Newfoundland, but I've got cousins that grew up in Denmark! Ever since I was a wee lad, I wanted to visit. I almost did back around 2015/16 but the Islamic Terror in Europe attacks freaked me out...
No word of a lie, my buddy, I have the grohmann #2 bird and trout! She is such an ergonomic knife. I have her stainless with the sabre grind. I use on trout, but would love to get her on rabbit (hare), and grouse. Stay tuned!
downsized from 88mb
mora companion vs mora companion HD. is one the obvious choice over the other? or is it preference, etc.?
Yes, it just looks nice. Can you process an animal with? Then it's good.
I own both in carbon and stainless.
From left to right: HD stainless, HD carbon, standard stainless, and standard carbon.
For me, HD moras are the obvious choice, mainly due to the slightly more obtuse edge grind. I've had problems with the standard mora rolling its edge during fairly normal "bushcraft" use. The standard mora has a 22-degree edge, whereas the HD mora has a 27-degree edge, making it more robust.
If you live in a wet climate, I'd recommend the HD in stainless steel; if you live in a dry climate, I'd recommend the HD in carbon steel because rust will not be an issue. Plus, the carbon steel version is easier to sharpen.
I live in a wet climate, so my pick is the HD in stainless. Great knoife.
How much of a meme are these survival knives for someone who only goes outdoors every few months? Just a better than nothing tool that I can keep in the car or throw in the pack.
Ultimately it's all whatever. Just don't baton cheaper stuff unless there is info saying otherwise. Serrated edges can both help and hurt. Not great for rope/string cutting.
wow, it even has a hole
So does my wife, but you don't see me dragging her into the woods
Kek, got the same ones in the extact same state
One is partially burnt i don't even remember why
Depends on who is making it. Actual Damascus is not being made anymore.
avoid serrations at all costs, absolute meme for 99% of /out/ activities
I agree with this. For a military knife, yes, serrations may be useful. But not for a /out/ knife.
140 checking in. Zero complaints for the price. I think I got mine for ~$70 shipped to the US a few years ago.
I've heard they feel a little flimsy
Not even close. It's a solid beast of a knife

strop after use so you dont ever have to sharpen. some goes with scandi grinds bros.
Thanks, brudder - that's what I've been doing!
how's the small Morakniv one? Big enough as a general tool and cooking utility?
It's perfect for food prep and small knife tasks. I usually pair it with that Condor kukri or one of my large fixed blades.
should think it would be a great little carving knife, for spoons and such, didnt they recently release a version that is just straight scandi-grind instead of the retarded double grind
Not sure, but I like the dual grind. Front is very slicey (tomatoes, peel apples etc) and the back end bites into wood nicely (obviously since it is classic Scandi). No hot spots in the handle at all. Well worth the ~$30
The Cold Steel Pocket Bushman is also a great, lightweight beast that should be in everyones pack.
I like the dual grind
ive just been using Mora´s for 28+ years, so when they suddently change things like that i hate it out of principal
So I guess full tang is the consensus?
depends on use case, steel, handle material and how much you watch youtube
what do you want you knife to do Anon?
batonny chop chop?
yeah sure
kitchen duty?
not necessary at all
stabbing bad guys Rambo style survive the appocalypse?
sure
normal sane person knife tasks?
nah
I just don't see the reason to go for folding. There's really nothing I'm going to use it for that I wouldn't use the big knife for and I want my big knife to be full tang.
the sleek profile of the #2 and #3 are quite nice. would like to have one (or 3) with stag horn handle. hope you have a good quality strop to keep that cutting edge razor sharp!
Full tang on a kitchen/butcher knife is actually very important. Probably more important than an /out/ knife unless you're doing stupid stuff with it.
Not him, but that's a NO from me
A chopping cleaver, yes
I have the #4 survival. Good knife, beautiful and feels good in the hand. But I have to admit I'm kinda disappointed in the cheaper carbon steel that it's made with. It doesn't hold a great edge. It stays sharp with minimal maintenance, but the razor sharp edge you get after a strop vanishes almost immediately upon using it. It also rusts very easily so you need to keep it oiled at all times.
I have also had pic related in my pocket for the past two years and it has never let me down. Their stainless steel seems better than their carbon steel.
No, even just a regular butcher knife. My girlfriend is a chef and she has broken knives just doing basic chef work on more than one occasion. Cutting through things like squash and yams can do a number on a cheaper knife.
Was originally going to get a Mora Garberg because of its full tang and 14C28N steel but once I discovered the Grohmamns I was already sold.
I digress. That's the price we pay for having hollow grinds compared to other cutting edge geometries. This is why people end up with huge knife collections. Nice folder anon, stay sharp out there.
God damnit. After posting that pic I bought the mora anyway. I will never financially recover from this
I really like that sheath
How does /out/ like my Camillus US Army utility knife from the 80s?

Also, what's the story on the Jet Pilot's Survival knife?
The hell is that piece of steel stuck to the back of the axe head? Oh btw, nice shiv you forged.
I picked up the Catteragus from some boomers gunshop many years ago, it was super rusted out but I cleaned it up and its served me ever since.
and the jet pilots knife I'm guessing you mean the one with the cork handle that is super shiny, not much of a story on that one, I got it at a local army surplus store in russia near my grandparents village.
as for that hunk of steel, its basically a hammer head used to drive pieces of wood into a log to split it down the middle, Its a Finnish lumber axe. Heres a good informational video that talks more about the design

If your using it to gut creatures to cook get a full tang. Folders are shit for processing meat because they get Offal in the folding part and are hard to clean. Folder handels also suck, ergonomically, compared to folders (especially for skinning knives).
Full tang blades are also usually thicker and can take more abuse.
*fixed blade handle > folder handle
I sewed the sheeth myself. Also I literally say why i made the leather strap on handle. Grip
Yeah but it's hard to find in stores and you can't get knives mailed to PO box iirc
Garden knife
Mora isn't a garden knife: this is a garden knife for master gardeners.
that's not the point
Any store that is a Buck dealer can get one on order for you. Knife center will ship internationally and to PO boxes.
Why didn't you just get a fixed blade knife in the first place?
very funny
Its quite sharp though hard to sharpen. Opens boxes and cuts chord; roots; branches and dirt, I'm sure you can batton with it but why.
Because I like buck 110
To clarify, it's small but heavy-ish for its size

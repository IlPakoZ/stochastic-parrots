I used to use heavy clunky hiking shoes that were probably half a size too small and you could feel my toes slightly being pushed together a bit when I put them on. And I could do 30-60 mile day hikes / day-night hikes in those types of shoes, in wet conditions, and never had any problems whatsoever, not even a hint of a blister. 
Now I'm trying out some more fancy, more-trail running style zero-drop hiking shoes. They all fit exactly how I've read they are supposed to: snug at the heel and midfoot, roomy at the toes. And within 2 miles in easy, dry conditions I am getting enough rubbing on the bottom of the toes for blisters to start forming and skin to start peeling.
So I'm guessing the minimalist shoe thing was just hippy bullshit.
I can't deny the trail runners are pretty comfortable though (at least for the first 1-2 miles). If I wear this style for long enough, will my feet adapt to them and stop having problems?
That shit looks stupid as hell lol
You clearly did zero research just find some YouTube videos. They all say you have to gradually transition to wearing those. Anyway yeah it’s fucking stupid and a gimmick.
lol
LMAO
Sounds like you need to do a little more homework (watching YouTube videos) on barefoot/minimalist shoes anon. You will have to keep wearing these and learn to not heel strike for a while before you get used to them yes. It's not too late to back out though because once you get used to them, regular shoes feel very awful.
Just did a 40 mile hike in nine hours in the leftmost boots. Don't even feel anything after resting for one hour at home and will probably do another round tomorrow. 
How does this make you feel?
That tells me you're taking a nice easy stroll not a hike
lol
LMAO!
instead of toe socks, just use a paper towel around each toe to keep your feet dry in boots
(you actually only need to wrap your second toe, and fourth toe)
How much that even is in civilized scale?
funny way to spell "driving"
It's 1,61km, but they will never learn..
I dont believe you.
40 miles / 9 hours = 4.44 miles per hour
That’s 7.15kmh for the Euro’s
That’s a slow jogging pace, roughly a 13.4 minute mile. Most armature jogging men run a 9 minute mile, roughly 6.7mph. Women are closer to a 10 minute mile, 6mph. A brisk walking pace (as opposed to a leisurely stroll) is 3.5mph, roughly a 17 minute mile, which is fairly true across the board. I’m almost a foot taller than my wife and our hiking and walking pace is fairly close.
You see the issue is you’re lying to people who know better. Those of us who’ve gone on longer hikes and had instances where we needed to hustle for whatever reason (daylight, weather, logistics) know that 4.4 miles in an hour would be jogging. Anyone who’s walked for exercise and timed their distance knows 4.4mph is a jogging pace. 
Pic rel, (You) training for your next hike
I ran/hiked this trail many times. That's why I'm faster. Also ran all hill sections, uphill / downhill carrying a 20lbs plate. Osmand says it was 59.6km, start at 11:53 finish at 21:26.
Does anyone who actually hikes wear these types of boots? I'm just wondering because I hike the AT fairly regularly, only live 20 minutes from it, and I rarely ever see these types of boots on day hikers or thru-hikers. It is always Merrells, Oboz, Altra, Soloman, Keen, etc (you know your normal brands). I've noticed an unhealthy obsession on this board with shoes and it leads me to think there are a lot of people with hurting feet just because they don't actually hike at all. The last hike I did I was unprepared for and wearing Hoka running shoes. I've alternated brands from Merrells, Oboz, Vasque, to now wearing Hoka hiking mids and I've had no issues with any of them, maybe a slight preference for styling but everything goretex, mid-ride has kept my feet dry &amp; quite honestly I think having quality socks like darn tough is far more important.
unhealthy obsession on this board with shoes
What else would you want to talk about?
I mean I would like to talk about recent outings and trails but I have to gatekeep.
It's because we don't like to associate with redditors that we choose more difficult terrain and hike out of season.
I only choose this boot yesterday because it and my feet needed a workout. You can wear anything for a "day hike" it doesnt matter.
Can't say I have the same problem, but if you do have that problem, better fitting socks that conform to your foot and don't slide around fix it.
Which incidentally are exactly what your picture is, those socks grip your feet and dont slide around, so even if there is sliding between the shoe and your foot, the sliding happens between your socks and your shoe, not your foot and your socks.
For daily stuff normal socks are fine, but if I'm going running or long walks, I put on the same pics you see in that image.
Shut the fuck up, faggot. No one believes you.
hike
Jog. He’s claiming he jogged 40 miles in those. And no, no one is hiking (or jogging, lol) in that style of boot. 
Kids on 4Chan see what Redditors or FB groups are saying or doing and just decide to be contrarian. Since hiking on trails is what they read about, they’ll say they never hike on trails. And since going off trail isn’t really differentiated with regards to mainstream thoughts on gear, these children presuppose that no one is doing it so they can just make up whatever the fuck they want.
People who actually hike off trail are using trail runners (with a rock plate or forefoot protection, not just any runner) or mids.
You can disbelieve me if you want but it won't change the fact that I'm in shape for these hikes. I regularly hike 15 miles a day with a 60lbs pack, so carrying a 20lbs plate is nothing for me.
You know where you have to go.
Let me guess: it only takes you three hours.
5.5 hours. I hike at a steady 3 mph which isn't hard for anybody.
That's not me replying
lose some weight and go to the gym.
Jog. He’s claiming he jogged 40 miles in those.
only jogged the hills
And no, no one is hiking (or jogging, lol) in that style of boot.
You have clearly never broken in a pair of boots. Post feet. I want to see your non-existant calluses.
Kids on 4Chan 
I'm older than you since you are obviously a reddit tourist.
You saw that somewhere on reddit or youtube didn't you? I never heard or seen anything like that irl.
pic rel is what experienced people wear in the backcountry.
lol
LMAO
where are you hiking?
I wear toe socks (injinji specially) and I like them. Not even for hiking or anything specific, just in general Far more comfortable than regular socks.
Eastern Europe/Scandinavia but I've also had those boot in Peru instead of the usual rubberboots.
This is the last selfie I took, in September of last year. Do I look fat?
Some tiddy fat but not too bad. Now show some feet.
Imagine being so out of shape that you can’t tell the difference between pectoral muscles and bitch tits.
Feet or back to redit with you.
goes from wearing restrictive, heavy, and imbalanced boots to zero-drop, wide toe trail runner
Your feet are fucked up and likely permanently misshapen.
You can’t just jump into zero-drop shoes and expect to be all good when you have fucked up feet.
It will take you months to get fully used to them, if ever, depending on how fucked your feet are.
is surprised his feet hurt after a few miles

Larp post
So why didn’t you post a pic of that data?
Oh yah, cuz you’re lying
Its not one or the other. Use zero drop trailrunners for trailrunning, fitness and sport. Running shoes on concrete and boots when you need to protect your feet from certain types of excessive wear.
Your feet, soles, ankles, and knees have a limited number of steps they can take before they break forever so taking the strain off one component or another can make a lot of sense depending on what you are going to be doing.
Wearing barefoot shoes for everything is not a good idea unless you are a office worker just strolling about after work.
Spoken like a true newfag with an opinion based on nothing.
Exercise strengthens bone, cartilage and ligaments, you retarded boomer. Wearing restrictive footwear causes them to atrophy and become prone to injury.
i've just been walking around in some water shoes (those things you see in walmart for pools &amp; rivers)
they works our great for literally everything but manmade structures, i can walk through entire beds of river stone &amp; wild forest, shits great, literally no problem other that you could say that they're meant for water (which is a non-problem, really)
they fit the bill for everything i need, what else can i say?
i love minimalist shoes as a daily shoe.
hiking in them is fucking retarded though.
Exercise strengthens bone, cartilage and ligaments, you retarded bloomer
Most of us work. Work is overtraining. Same goes for hiking or walking 20 to 30k 5 days a week. That's not training anymore. Real daily conditions require you to think practically about how to get as much mileage out of your feet as possible. Trailrunners might sometimes be the best option but not always.
Its enough to wear running shoes a few hours every day to prevent any kind of athrophy, and its still possible to wear boots the rest of the day. I have never met anyone who had "atrophy". All you need to stay in shape is to go for a few jogs each week.
Unlike you I use every kind of shoe and boot there is. Just admit that you have weak and soft feet. It's ok. Just be honest.
I wear minimalist boots. they're awesome. Feet feel amazing. Only issue is they're not waterproof and they're not grippy walking down hill in the wet because they don't have the heal lug. 
I wore them for ages without insoles and it was fine, after I rolled my ankle in gumboots one day I started using a hard foam orthotic and they feel even better now. I used shoe goo to make the sides stiffer too.
I'm not walking 30 miles on trial in them though, I'm walking mostly off trail in the bush on variable terrain and on mountain tops, 10km at the most and not on worn trails, nice soft ground. Id never fuck around with trail running style shoes man, sounds sketch. It is a bit of a meme though, If I didn't roll my ankles so much in proper boots I wouldn't wear these. 
It's also absolute bliss feeling the textures under your feet on.
Other than abrasion protection, what do these offer that a minimalist shoe doesn’t (assuming both have similar soles, forefoot protection, toe box size, etc.)?
Hijacking the thread. I went off trail during bad weather conditions in my running sneakers, needless to say I was looking like an idiot having to slither down the mountain back to the gravel path. What boots do you guys recommend for longer hikes that have enough grip to climb steep and muddy terrain?
A lot of ankle support, forwards and sideways. Warm. bang protection. Don't get dirt in your feet. A really snug fit all the way up. 
Every thing that a boot should do really, without the huge lug of rubber underneath it. It could be made even more supportive laterally around the foot though, that'd be even better.
On this image:
AB - Lowa Renegade
B - Lowa Ranger
BC - Hanwag Alaska
C - Hanwag Omega
What you pick is personal preference but a soft boot like a Lowa Renegade is obviously softer and more smooth and gentle for delicate trailrunning feet. B boots are allrounders that can be used in most circumstances. People often complain about BC boots being too heavy or too tough on their knees. It depends on what you are used to and on how often you will wear them whether or not you can get used to hiking long distances with anything heavier than a B boot.
So do trail runners
Yeah great infographic.
If there is even a little bit of slope to the ground you are walking, meaning it is anything other than a paved path through a park, you absolutely must wear mid top or taller boots with heavy lugged soles and protective rubber welt or you will fall directly on your face and break both your ankles.
Thanks guys, that helps a lot. I will take a look at them. Are there any other brands that you can recommend for europoors?
Well I wear Altra Lone Peak, which are zero drop foot shaped minimalish teal runners, and I do 70 - 100 mile hikes in literal thunderstorms the whole way and have no problems at all. 
Fresh as a daisy at the end of the hike I don't even need to drink or eat so you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
You buy new shoes every third hike?
Well I do 71 - 101 miles hikes.
Also Im the kind of the universe and have have a 9” penis.
nobody with hillbilly feet here? barefoot or water shoes shoes for me in summer. boots when cold or feet hurt. i seems to just trash any footwear with mud/water within a few hours and would rather not have to take time to clean and dry them constantly if i dont have to. buy 40$ chink barefeet shoes off amazon and have a a pair of water shoes or 2. have boots for when you need them. honestly though who cares where what works or what you like. shoes are usually my last concern when out.
The shit i read
I wore lone peaks for a month of trail running and got tendonitis, do not recommend. (was wearing NB's for years before, same trails, same conditions)
If you are europoor you can get all of these boots on sales. I never have to pay more than $200, even after inflation.
5280 ft
This board is always so pissy, just hide these threads and carry on with your day.
320 rods.
Probably switched too fast. I did okay but I restarted running with lone peaks, so my distances and cadence were shorter and slow for a bit. I went to trail runners, there's not much on trails that need more
why did I get memed in to barefoot shoes?
they just hurt to walk around in, but I'm in too deep to quit them
This
If you have been wearing heels your whole life it takes some time to get your feet legs and back back to where they are supposed to be.
Ancient people walked a zillion more miles than you ever will and they had no shoes at all.
I beat the absolute tar out of my altra trail runners on the Hoh River trail, and I've used them on scrambles and hikes. They are my everyday beaters now, and I've had no issues with my feet or anything. I sincerely think they might be one of the best shoes out there for amateur hikers.
I've used them without them and used them with. It's much better with, personally, especially because it relieved my tendonitis. The main advantage of a minimalist boot is not having heal drop and all the rubber shit underneath. When you're in the mountains with a heavy pack on for a week, on difficult terrain, having support is pretty helpful, and having an inside edge to push into slopes is priceless.
Cringe OP
Love my Lone Peaks, but they really are lacking untie and forefoot protection, and I could see the sides possibly failing just because they’re so thin, but those are environmental issues. It’s not super rocky here so they work great. Mega-aggressive tread, too.
U have to get used to them slowly, they are better as a fact but u cant jump into it like a shoe/boot u are used to, i prefer it sock less cuz u can wash them
Let me guess, you need more?
My guide gave me rainboots to wear when I went hiking in Sapa. It was surprisingly not terrible. Would still pick trail runners over them though unless you are in an extremely wet area.
I got these chinese shoes for $4 from ebay, they've got better grip than any top of the range trail runners on the market. Same performance as barefoot shoes for 1% of the price.
lol
But on a serious note, I’m switching ti Chinese brands to cut out the middle man. Any link for these shoes?
Yeah I wear them everyday for working in a marsh. Posting this from a marsh right now, even.

How do I build the stamina for longer hikes? I usually go on about a 1 mile hike, never actually finish a trail, I just start it and get to a certain point, lose my energy, and come back the way I came. I want to actually finish a trail.
What would you suggest?
You know what they say. Practice is worthless.
Go on hikes more often. Run/exercise. How the fuck do you give up at 1 mile? Even when I was an obese loser retard on my first hike I could at least do 8-12 miles a day.
Just finish the trail? Bring a snack, take a break, finish the trail. How the hell can't you finish a 1 mile hike? I don't even eat before hand and just run off ketosis for a couple miles with a loaded pack (max fat loss) until I finish and then I get a nice big lunch.
I always heard it as:
Practice makes permanent 
This--walk atleast 5k a day. Start adding weight and distance as it gets easier.
How do I build the stamina for longer hikes?
you hike more
I just start it and get to a certain point, lose my energy
bring a snack
Shitty bait
What would you suggest?
posting more on here should help
Try a bit of caffeine before you start out to give you a boost of energy. Some folks drink coffee, others an energy drink like Monster or Red Bull, for serious exercise hikes you could do pre workout supplements. The best and only way to build stamina is to do the activity you want to build stamina. So hiking, long distance walking, or running. Running is the best but it sucks starting out.
holy shit glen what's wrong with your face!
This isn't the hobby for you.
You just finish the fucking trail. Everyone of us gets tired sometimes, if it's bad you sit down and rest a moment. 
I don't know any regular hiker who gets the impulse to bail in the middle of a hike. If you're that kinda person I don't think you'll ever find much joy in backpacking.
If you are not actually larping good on you for exercising use a tracker watch gradually over each week increase it by steps keep hydrated have everything you need to be prepared in the uk we carry knifes because of joggers
practice, start small, increase volume by 10% a week, have a rest week every 4th week where you cut volume by 50%
nu-/out/ will still bump the thread relentlessly
You go until you can't go anymore then you hope your survival instinct gets you back out. If you don't make it you get weeded out the population.
It's how we've always done it
1 mile
that's not a hike. start walking to the grocery store, the pharmacist, the hardware store, wherever.
just run you dumb nigger
Even when I was an obese loser retard on my first hike I could at least do 8-12 miles a day.
Same. Well, almost the same, because when I was young I was in great condition, and I hiked tons in the 90s and early 2000s. In between then, I joined the rat race and became an obese loser.
A few years back, in my mid-30s, fat and out of shape, I could carry a loaded daypack uphill 4-5 miles and then back down again, and feel fine. I shudder to think what kind of shape OP must be in to give up at the 1-mile mark, what the fuck?
Hike less, you're over doing it by going a friggin mile
Sounds like you have a horrific diet and probably some other health problems, maybe anemia, and bad sleep, or something. Get your health sorted out dude.
Bump!
I was embarrassed to post a 1 mile trail run on Strava because I thought it wasn't long enough to post
1 mile hike
That's not a hike. That's a stroll.
Rightfully so, lad. You should be embarrassed about one mile.
Thank you anon, I thought the trail would be longer (it wasn't mapped on Strava and only loosely tracked on all trails) I ended up doing two laps then realized it was a shit excuse for a trail and left.
1 mile
american car culture is at fault
Jimmy Carr has aged terribly
jenny craig diet?
Need to do stair climbers too
Don't usually visit this board, but I'd assume having a good diet?
Just give up at the end and walk back
You just walk bro. I was fat as fuck but walked 5 miles a day for a couple months and then went on my first backpacking trip ever across Glacier NP weighing 380lbs. I crossed paths with an Australian couple at the top of a pass and heard them saying "even the hikers are fat" while they were walking away.
1 mile
Do you mean 10 miles because 1 is like a first graders way to school or a shopping trip.Giving up that quickly can't possibly be an energy thing outside of serious health issues, it's a you-hate-it thing. Or do you use an aid to get around inside your home?
Take it easy and make it easy: Start early, wear old sneakers and sweater istead of whatever you just bought for hiking, bring fruit and oats for snacking, drink enough, take breaks whenever you feel like it, bring friends to talk to or some music/podcast to listen to when bored.
How do I build the stamina for longer hikes?
By reading 4chan and watching youtube videos about /out/ stuff.
gotta eat your way through to the other side of this issue
Each day, put a dollar in a jar. When you finish a trail you get all the money in the jar. This is a good way to save up for smokes.
'tarded
That's fucked up. Sorry, bro.
Lmao fuckin cunts
Jump rope might help.
i'm still 20kg overweight and walk 20mile hikes.
it's just a mental thing in my opinion
Keep walking as long as you can into the woods. When you get tired, take a rest, eat a granola bar, then walk further until you're tired. Only then may you turn around.
What would you suggest?
just fucking finish it you lazy cunt
stop giving up
Do a treadmill test then get some stents. If you run out of energy after a mile it's something medical.

I want to drive to a wilderness type location, walk as far as I can in a day, let's say 15-20 miles, around a mountain range. Camp and sleep the night, then the next day walk back to the car a different route. What's the name for this? Wild camping? Adventure camping?
trekking
i call that hiking or backpacking. wild camping is a euro term
Look up "dispersed camping" at your nearest national forest
backpacking, for sure.
and it sounds fun.
Did you think you invented this? It's an overnight backpacking trip. Why is this a thread?
they're asking what the term for the concept is, autist
Just camping, or a single day backpacking trip.
But with backpacking, you pack up your camp, hike 15-20 miles to another location, set up another camp, and do it again. Eventually, hike all the way back around.
You can do this every single day or spend prolonged periods at each camp, and now you understand how nomadic hunter gatherers lived.
It's also called boondocking or roughing it
If you can catch deer and fish, and you can gather and garden, you can sustain a family and even a community from the wilderness. This is tribal society, it revolves around sharing meat.
This is also how homesteads survived on the frontier on the edge of civilization.
They had cabins and houses, with gardens, and they could hunt and fish, so they would not go hungry. Even today, there are people who live like this in Appalachia.
only the most skilled and lucky hunter is going to bag enough game to feed a family year round. you need numerous people employing mass kill tactics to even have a hope
Basically just backpacking or back country camping. 
boondocking
that term is typically used for RV/Camper types who are camping without hook ups.
Family of 4 could probably get by on 10 deer a year.
Backcountry camping but if you walk in it's called dispersed camping/ backpacking

Do you throw rocks? Can you nail a tin can at 50 feet? Do you instinctively lob grapefruit size rocks into water? Ever accidently a window? Skip rocks on a glass smooth lake?
I'd feel bad for you but I've long since realized that empathy of autistics is a waste.
If it skips a dozen times, I say it has been a good day
This is definitely the worst board.
I always carry a baseball-sized rock in my pocket. I have taken out quite a few grouse with them, and one rabbit last year. My hobby is to laugh at survival shows where people bring bows and sling shots and shit. Where's your throwing rock, idiot?
Do you throw rocks?
yes
Can you nail a tin can at 50 feet?
around 15 meters? eh, probably not by hand, but i have a braided sling that i love taking with me, fun as fuck 10/10 would recommend making one
Do you instinctively lob grapefruit size rocks into water?
1000X better if the water has ice on it
Ever accidently a window?
never accidentally, with intent? yes
hell yea
Do you throw rocks?
Of course 
Can you nail a tin can at 50 feet?
Absolutely not, but like the other anon said a sling is extremely fun 
Do you instinctively lob grapefruit size rocks into water?
I prefer to split them to find minerals and gemstones, if it's a flint boulder I always bring it home. I live near old chalk quarries and you can find high quality flint that's been brought up with the chalk. 
Ever accidently a window?
Once or twice while practicing with my slings before I built my range. 
I wish I had lakes near me, nothing but chalk streams and tidal estuaries
There was one episode where several people tried to catch a snake and one guy cut it's head off. Just smash a giant rock on it ffs
Yes.
Never tried, probably not.
Yes, was clearing out a bunch from a section of soon-to-be-playground and one slid out of my hand at an angle and ricocheted off the building. Not my proudest moment.
No, too much wind here for such a thing to form.
I don’t think I’ve ever gone outdoors and not thrown something at a tree. Generally is a rock, but a stick or tight pine cone works in a pinch. That’s also my answer to “ what do I do if I’m bored?” Throw rocks at trees.
Respect your ancestors
i throw rocks from cliffs and hills all the way down until they hit a path or barn. but not into water. i rather flip stones above water.
Whenever i go out for a jog if i see a nicely shaped rock i go and throw it as far as i can with technique. It's exceptionally entertaining because it's so easy to improve your accuracy over just a few months of this. My lil cousin always gets impressed by my throwing range and accuracy. 
Also anyone else enjoy skipping rocks? I got a 6-7 yesterday, pretty proud of it.
Rolling large rocks down hills brings a warm joy to ones being. Especially with friends.
Throwing rocks is peak cavecore. Love making slings and slingshots too, what about a giant slingshot you strap to two close trees? Lob some fuckin bricks. As far as skipping goes, I like to try to skip a massive rock, even just one
Yup, skipping dinner plate size rocks is retarded fun for how simple it is.
Is this the end goal?
If you want it to be, yes. It's all part of the simple joy of rock throwing.
based
No, that's not throwing. 
Braemar and open stone throws (from the highland games) would be the end form of rock throwing.
My ancestors didn't throw rocks out of autistic retardation, they did it with purpose
How do you think they practiced you numbskull
With purpose, can't you read
Clearly you can't, because the OP also throws rocks with purpose, such as hitting tin cans.
Do you throw rocks?
I've always had tiny hands and bulky arms since I was a rug rat. I can't throw anything further than 30 yards or so. Throwing always made me feel slightly impotent, escpecially compared to my slightly older cousin who could throw a baseball 55 mph at 12 years old.
Running was the same, my legs are short and stocky. I'm basically a 5'8" 175 lbs raccoon.
Can you nail a tin can at 50 feet?
I can but it take several tries. It's easier if I buckshot it with 3 or more rocks at once.
Do you instinctively lob grapefruit size rocks into water?
I can barely hold a grapefruit overhanded, let alone a 3 lb rock.
Ever accidently a window?
When I was 5 I was dicking around with a dinner plate and it slipped out of my hand. My parents were mad but were already aware I had... dexterity issues.
Skipping sized stones aren't a problem. I've gotten pretty good at getting 5-10 skips out of a good flat stone. Kids always flock around me and ask how I do it.
I don't like chucking large stones in water. I'm always afraid I'm disturbing or possibly injuring wildlife under the surface. I fish a lot so I'm very nature conscious.
Getting the joke is hard, we know. It's okay, anon.
Shit, my bad
Yeah of course. You want to upgrade your rocking throwing, make a sling, then you can really fuck shit up. People I was hiking with me didn't believe me (retards I guess) but I built a shitty sling out of paracord and still absolutely exploded a beer can lol. Not sure what other outcome they were expecting.
bump
Take the rock pill 
Throw rocks
Make rock tools
Collect pretty rocks
Make rock house
Make rock bed and pot
COOK on HOT ROCKS
START FIRE WITH ROCKS 
ROCKS will NEVER betray you
ROCKS are the STRONNGEST
Would this actually work? I know about flint on steel but has anyone ever actually started a fire by bashing 2 rocks together? I know some sparks can generate but it's really pitiful amounts

Pyrite was used before steel, if that counts
I often sit in or near shallow streams and knap flint into arrowheads. Its calming.

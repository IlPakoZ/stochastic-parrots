camped out last night in central/northern Pennsylvania. just as i was falling asleep i heard an animal - some 2-300 feet from my campsite make a noise that sounded like "PFFFFFFFFT. PFFFFFFFT". It sounded a strong exhalation from the chest cavity and out through the nostrils. I hopped out of my hammock, problem solver in hand and shouted "YOOOOO" and heard it scurry off. I heard it again sometime around 4:30 in the morning but it sounded even further away. I listened for some time, heard it walking away from my camp site and just let it fuck off. I've been looking online for videos of black bears (all that we have in PA) and deer noises and nothing quite matches up to what i heard. 
Was it a black bear, /out/?
Probably a black bear, they sound exactly like you described. Be careful anon, its been an unusually warm winter so a lot of bears are really hungry right now.
thanks. that was my suspicion and recollection as well, but I can't match up the sound from anything I find on youtbe
animals can make all sorts of sounds that you cant find on video or in a book. I once heard the eeriest shit of my life just to figure out it was a vicen who screamed herself into having a hoarse throat
It was most likely a black bear. They can be aggressive when foraging for food so it's best to keep any potential food such as fruits, poop, nuts in tight fitting containers as they have excellent smell. Other than that, black bears can be scared off easily with noise.
Whoops for OP!
Sounds like a deer huffing by your description.

that means the deer saw something it really didn't like, like a bear, yote, or OP
Yep! very similar sound. Mine was longer and a bit deeper - must have come from a largish buck. Thank you!
Or OP's camp was right where the deer likes to shit.
Caribou sound exactly like that when they are stressed but a lot of animals can make this noise.
It's a damn hog looking for shit off the ground
Sounds like you described the crackous viniggerous. they have habitat all over the USA.
This got me thinking about all the other weird shit I've heard in the woods making noises you wouldn't expect. Here's a few I've encountered innawoods.

A fox screaming near your camp late at night will rattle you to your core, if you don't know what it is. So don't always assume its ayy lmaos or samsquanches. Almost everything you hear out there has a simple explanation.
Yup, this freaked me out the first time I heard one.

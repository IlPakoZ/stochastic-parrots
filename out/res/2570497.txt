Can I finally kick over rock stacks without people thinking I'm an autist?
Maybe. 
But I'm still going to think you're an autist.
What is the danger? I assume it is some mental gymnastics but I don't care to read it
Might start building some if that's the case
No, you don't understaaaand, He's against stacks of rocks, He can't be autistic anymore!
Just like he's not gay because he stopped sucking dicks in bus station bathrooms last week.
It negatively impacts the environment when hundreds of insta whores stack rocks for updoots
it's something about the disrupting of the ecosystem. "lizard lived under that rock!!"
based
inb4:
Imagine making a Youtube channel entirely focused on rock stack kicking. Going on big missions to find rock stacks and kick them over hahahaha. 
I couldn't do it I'm not cool enough.
Many birds nest in stones.
Check out this river bed in Germany, nothing can survive there.
that's vile
Who makes the "Leave No Trace" patch with the boot kicking over the rock stack?
The level of motivation and retardation are a dangerous combination--as in your case. These (you) are the same kind of people that move to the woods, cut down all the trees, and claim to be environmentalists because the they followed timber industry guidelines.
That lizard under the rock contributes more to the ecosystem than you and your entire extended family.
You're a fat female aren't you.
how many years will it take for mud avoidance shaming to go mainstream
really tired of seeing shit get blown the fuck up every spring since covid because faggots in trail runners refuse to go through the mud and soil their tutus
Trailrunner faggots will eventually turn every trail into a highway.
Just because of you i'm going to keep stomping on every small animal that crosses my path on hikes. As an apex predator, these beta prey fags need fear us
They already do. Last week two snakes literally jumped to get away from me.
if i was bored enough to scrape alltrails i suspect that trail listings correlate with a dramatic increase in reports of poor trail conditions or mud beyond within 2-3 years in an exponential way
Only on 4chan will you find people who have a problem with a small stack of rocks, or more precisely, the enjoyment experienced by stacking rocks. How about just letting people have fun?
Only on 4chan will you find people who have an obsession with making a small stack of rocks, or more precisely, the soothing repetitive experience of stacking rocks. How about just letting the rocks stay where they are?
I've never once seen any travel or hiking instagramers post any rock stacks. Seems more likely it's kids and families.
leave no trace retard
it's that simple
cairns are not a big deal but they're up there after littering/improper shit disposal and trail widening
And that's okay
I have fun kicking cairns.
kek, this faggot again. 
We've been over this kiddo, just because no woman will ever touch your genitals does not mean everyone who refuses to jerk you off is female, it's not a symmetrical axiom.
be nice, pretending there are real women on 4chan is the closest he'll ever get to talking to one.
Right? A bunch of these autists were the type to shit themselves at recess if you didn't play along with their silly games, because how dare other people enjoy things differently.
wahhhh it'll harm nature
An ecosystem that can't handle surface stones being moved around wasn't meant to survive.
b-b-but leave no trace
Federal Government sponsored propaganda solely to regulate another thing that is solved with proper parenting.
Many of the oldest human structures and settlements were founded on/near cairns; if such a prehistoric practice is "unnatural" and worthy of destruction then you better be consistent and kill every livestock/crop you come across because those are just as ancient and """"environmentally impactful"""".
You do realize you're the guy in your picture, right anon?
you seem to be confused, there aren't any "stackers" in these threads, it's autists angry at rocks and people laughing at them.
Wat. How does it negatively impacts the environment? It's dumb, but I hardly see it killing off the spotted owl. It's just rocks' but in stack form.
You'd get millions of views.
Nothing?
Certainly not the birds, lizards and insects that used to live there.
The best parts is this, the area had to be closed off for normies. So the normies went up and down the river and started the same there. Took three years to completely destroy the habitats there as well.
So they tried to close these parts as well for normies, which was a big thing as now the river was closed for about 6 or so km and people began to notice.
They had to close the river downstream for people with boats, as there was a constant stream of tourists, buying a 60€ plastic boat and a few crates of beer, going into the water, drifting 10 or 20km down stream. They then popped the boat and threw the bottles and the plastic into the river.
So Tölz-Wolfratshausen has stopped any tourists from going near the river in an attempt to save the last gravel nesting birds, but tourists don't give a fuck. So they started policing the river and handing out fines and that is where we are now.

This happened over the last 15 or so years, it got worse every year, the gravel nesting birds are fewer and fewer, the river is full of plastic boats and bottles and utterly destroyed over several km and you are fined if you go near the river.
Then you have this idiot, not understanding what is happening and why something gets regulated:
The same happens at a greater scale on the entire planet, we will end with everything fucked up and highly regulated.
i will continue destroying cairns and you will continue to seethe
I kick rock stacks over whenever I see them
Do not molest the wildlife. Rocks are part of the wildlife.
Certainly not my sense of calm.
It's hippy cunts
Who cares if people think you're autistic? My girlfriend thought I was weird at first, but 3 years later she joins me in kicking them and we take turns. Usually we scatter the rocks around so that someone can't just come along and easily stack them back up.
Based
Only in Germany would the government outlaw the enjoyment of a river. What a commie shithole. They say you get the government you deserve...
Are you telling me your country doesn't have conservation laws? I find that hard to believe.
kick my rocks down i dont care, im just going to stack more and you cant stop me
Are you telling me your country doesn't have conservation regulations because it doesn't take in refugees?
I will bury you under the rocks after I kick them down inshallah
Not OP but impotent rage is a pretty common phrase, impotent in this instance meaning powerless or ineffectual, as opposed to limp-dicked
God bless you in your righteous destruction. One other thing I haven't seen mentioned, cairns can be misconstrued as trail markers, it's happened to my retard ass before. Much as you shouldn't go marking blazes or tying flagging tape on random trees, you shouldn't build cairns where someone might get drawn off-trail. And also why must we always fuck with everything to begin with
Conservation laws where I live tend to pertain to what you're allowed to do in the area (e.g. hunt, fish, camp, have fires etc.) I don't know of anywhere in Canada that's literally off limits.
There are plenty of small nature reserves in Canada that being on will get you forcibly removed and charged.
example?
That was the fault of the people fucking it and drawing attention. An example of 'gatekeeping is good actually', folks should have policed themselves.
Rockstacking is the /out/ version of the shopping cart.
Inshallah brother

straight from the Wildlife Area Regulations
Ok I stand corrected. Never heard of any of those.
Most are very small, or extremely remote. The Suffield reserve is interesting since it borders a significant military base where they do a lot of live fire training.
I thought rock stacking was a 4chan thing actually. I remember seeing threads on it years ago, then seeing anti-rock stacking PSAs 6 months to a year after those threads started.
The idea was "Africa couldn't even stack rocks" and to bring awareness to how far behind any African technology was.
At least some of these have legit reasons you shouldn't go there
kek
https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/326526540/#326526540
Can't find any earlier threads without spending more than a couple minutes, but you get the idea.
anti-rock stacking sentiment has been around for much longer than that. looks like a troll thread to be honest, also it's /pol/ which is 90% shills and bots trying to poison the well and gas light everyone.
The ultimate /out/... 
is anyone here man enough to camp there?
Cairns
FPBP
when it's done on this scale I can see how it would be harmful for critters
of course
Never have been one to make rock cairns in the past, but I think I'll start.
Holy shit I get this quote now.
Vostok Heavy Industries makes them. Checked
that's in Austria
I don’t stack rocks because I don’t want to bother the fae folk and I don’t kick cairns because they may have been built by fae folk. 
What I WILL do is make wildflower bouquets and leave them on stumps or leave some granola or a peanut butter sandwich, or sometimes I will carve sticks at home into whimsical figures and leave them on stumps.
I want to rebuild our relationship with the fae folk.
what is wrong with you? what compels a man to act like this? baffling
based maker of offerings
Why kick rocks when I can kick autists?
yeah, stacking rocks is stupid, i usually prefer to throw them around.
You’re a faggot
Based
Rock stacks are comfy for some
I don't know about you, but I can comprehend a pile of rocks just fine.
It does seem really satisfying
Can't the bundeswehr like set up an exclusion zone or sumthin?
attention from retards like you taking the bait probably
this just in
50% of all the people have an IQ of 99 or below.
Every fourth person you meet has problems reasoning why laws are needed, sugary drinks are bad or how to get a passport.
A large number of people are incredibly stupid.
Isn't that part of Germany?
I know I know it sucks. But basically I'm going to keep kicking them over
I personally fucking hate stackers. They are destroying nature and are no different than strip miners in this thread, >>2570698 → , that turn over the landscape. Fuck stackers.
That's a boy. There's something in the water, isn't there?
Oh my god I would kick over every single one of those if it took me days.
you're definitely the typa autist that would do something like that
It'll be faster if we work together
So he is retarded
It's a /pol/ troll. Of course he is retarded.
We're actively destroying and polluting the environment but rock stacking is bad mkay?
Get some friends, loser.
He posts OC.
You post banter.
You are not the same.
I have decided to become a stacker
When the route isn't obvious, I intentionally stack rock cairns near goat tracks to bamboozle anyone who can't use a topographical map and compass.
No need to thank me, just doing my bit to thin the herd.
You get a pass. If I kick over your stacks I apologize.
Are you a druid
Birds that nest in rock piles along rivers wouldn't survive in the US due to the predator population. A fox or coyote would have a field day. On top of that we like to add extra non native predators to the mix, like pythons and iguanas, just to make it extra spicy for the native wildlife.
Imagine going to the championships and during the judging you just went ham and started kicking over all the rocks.
If you stack rocks the Coyotes will become bamboozled by them, so the iquanas will be able to reproduce on river beds and then spread out, damaging the ecosystem.
Their survival strategy is based on stealth, as there are also predators, like wild cats and foxes in Europe.
It ruins the wilderness because it is a clear sign of humans beign around and on "trails" it can be dangerous because it can lead people the wrong way as these things are used to mark the route..

I've noticed a massive increase in "community CCTV cameras" in my town. Obviously, I don't want to be watched on the trails.
What is the best method of spotting these in the dark - some sort of scope?
Take the schizophrenia medication, friend. We want to help you.
Don't go to England; during Thatcher's reign (at the height of Sinn Fein's terror campaign) the government installed tens of thousands of CCTV cameras in the woods. The camera coverage was designed to allow police to view any rural area with no more than fifteen meter gaps between camera views. This vast network of cameras is continually being expanded and updated with new technology.
I'm not being schizo. There are signs, specifically, put up to deter poachers.
Don't go to England
can't help living there
There are ways to use a cell phone to detect infrared waves, which most cameras use. Search youtube or google it.
use another camera or nightvision to spot them, any camera should see them as a light that doesnt show up to your eyes
an IR camera (even just a handycam with a night vision mode) will expose the lens very easily, they also sell little handheld dealies that people use to scope out their hotel rooms and airbnbs and suchnot
I use a Bushnell night vision scope, any tiny cameras hidden in the trees etc will glisten and shine like a star when flashed with an IR beam
Get High-Power laser pointer
Aim at camera from a safe distance
Camera goes kaputt
???
Profit
nægrœ it would be nearly impossible to steadily aim a laser directly into a camera aperture even from like 2m away, nevermind doing this from an actual distance. snot gonna happen
can't help living there
just leave
The only place where these cameras should be are at trailheads to deter all the vehicle break-ins that have been happening lately
They downed a drone in some protests in Argentina a few years ago with lasers. It can be done.
well yeah if you have a tripod and scope setup sure. not if you're shooting from the hip while you're /out/ hiking
t. had a neighbour with a rooster and bought my superlaser specifically to attack it when it would scream and crow right outside my window evey morning, had very few moments of direct laser-retina contact
I've tried using my phone but that won't even get the ring doorbells - how well will IR cameras work?
How powerful does it need to be?
just start taking a piss or a shit when you see them and act like you don't.
One of my neighbors is an uptight city lib who hates the very notion of people being near his property. He set up trail cams pointing everywhere, including a public walking trail. 
One day me and my buddies got super drunk and somehow the topic of one of mynbuddies cosplays comes up. He has a film accurate Chewbaka costume. We always joke it looks like bigfoot. Then we get the idea to fuck with my neighbor. Buddy dawns the suit and he starts strutting past various camara from about 50 yards away. He stays far enough away that the camera picks up definitely something ape like and hairy but not much else. After having a few laughs we forget about my neighbor until he confronted me 2 days later and showed me how he caught fucking bigfoot on his camaras.
To this day still believes he captured bigfoot. Kek every goddamn time he brings it up even a damn decade later. Still funny.
Where did this happen? My dad spent months obsessing over how he found bigfoot on a trail cam he had set up around his house in a suburb in Florida. He kept trying to "submit the photos for academic study".
he posted the photos on /x/
An actual IR camera would work fine because it emits an actual IR beam and that's what makes the lens glisten. Check yousetube you can find some demos. I have a little hidden camera that I tested this with and works a charm
How powerful does it need to be?
no idea. I think a $50 one should be enough. I´d go for like 300-500mw. The stronger the better obviously. They aren´t that expensive. And they´re fun. And you can do some nasty shit with them, like blind cops at protests and other fun activities.
How am I going to have sex with my gf in the woods now?
Ask me how I know you're a fat female 
Only subhumans and roasties call people schizo. They never offer anything of value.
when I spot them before they spot me, I put one leg over the camera so it is between my legs, and then slowly lower my balls in front of the lens, and swing them back and forth. I have probably done this a couple hundred times over the years
same way you always did. on camera.
shhh just get in the oven and it will all be over soon.
If I call him a jew no one will notice
every time
You have undiagnosed ADHD if you cant aim something steady without a tripod for atleast a few seconds at a time. Get some help and you'll realize how easy it is to keep your hands steady for normal people.
Thinking there are cameras out deep in the woods recording you is literally paranoid schizophrenia. The only actual cameras on public trails are at the entrance or exit to gauge how much use the trail gets by the public so the local government can decide if they want to put more funding into them, and all the one's I've seen are at knee height.
Not any of those anons, but it's pretty common for trail cams to be placed in trails where bucks and deer occasionally roam to note how their migration pattern is changing this year to buy space in the private hunting zones that usually surround most natural reserves with game. A wealthy city boomer will pay top dollar to hunt in a target rich area and since you cant force the game to stay in a single place, it has become a big part of the business to set up feeders and in some cases artificially creating pressure by hunters hiking in a certain spot to make the deer favor the direction to their land over the others.
Based. Wear a ski mask before disabling your local trail cam in minecraft
Op said there are literally signs put up by the local community watch saying there are cameras. Learn to read.
import thousands of rapists/killers and this is the result
sad what straight white conservatives become when they cant get laid
but anon some of them are good people
angry that YT notices a behavior
angrier that YT notices a pattern linking a behavior to a group
that behavior is rape
angry YT just needs to rape and he won’t be so salty 
Very third world take senpai
Are you sure about that?
This thread totally wasn't started by a serial killer
I assume
I'm in South East England, we don't have deep forests. I've found two of the cameras so far, got one with a rock and not sure about the other.
The cameras are meant to deter people from "poaching" fish
I have never found any cameras in the woods or any infrastructure that would facilitate them. 
That being said, I live in wales, but the implication of your post is that they would have been placed all over the UK
The cameras are meant to deter people from "poaching" fish
if that is the case they would only be around angling clubs. They don't give a shit about just general rivers.
IR - they make enough heat to stand out.
Wear a broad-brimmed hat or a hoodie.
why so defensive of me mentioning the importing of rapists?
meds... NOW!!!
source
never seen anything that would indicate this
you have poo colored skin
the same way robber's detect them: use a weak light and look for small dots that reflect the light. obviously you can only do this in low light/in the dark
You’re a fucking loser
problem?
I just saw one of these signs for the first time over the weekend. And forgot to smile when I passed by.
Bring a slingshot or gun with you and shoot them out
a real chad drops money on a right proppa pcp air rifle to snipe them with
I put cameras out all the time. I put this one on sort of a game trail off a main trail, people use it though. This was a 3:00am and was weird someone was out there. I was actually looking to get pics of deer/bear/wolf.
I talked to a cop while we were bringing clothing to a naked man in the woods. It's a funny story but the reason the cops knew there was a naked dude is because of the CCTV network in the woods. I researched the matter further and confirmed it. This program was so well known in the late 80s and early 90s that there is no shortage of information on it. The fact that there are UK /out/ists who are completely unaware of it baffles the mind.
this isn't a source
You fucking dolt, a cop telling me he knows there's a naked man in the woods because of the CCTV is a fucking source. Like I said, if you get off your ass and research it you'll find plenty of articles.
Make sure to wear a mask and leave the phone at home.
Something like this. If you can see IR somehow, it’s super easy to spot those cams when they click on.
The good thing about a proper IR camera is twofold.
For one, it has an IR spotlight which exposes spectral reflections immediately, so you can see any glass, reflectors, or lenses glowing in the light which you would never see with the naked eye. And second as you say is they will plainly see the spotlights of any triggered IR or trail cameras

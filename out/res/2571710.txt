AHHH I WANT MY OWN PERSONAL FOREST
I WANT TO BE HEAR THE CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH UNDER MY FEET
I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND JUST ROCKS AND DIRT FOREVER
One out of the seven hopniss tubers I planted came up, and I put them in the ground nine days ago. Is this normal?
Have you read "Edible Forest Gardens"? I'm halfway through volume 2 now, and I'm really enjoying it. Planning is pretty intense, and the book is kind of a slog, but I'm really excited to have trees and bushes and actual nature in my backyard instead of just stupid grass.
still need advice for 
i'm gonna be planting a bunch of luffa along a fence once any chance of freeze in my area is totally null (i'm in north west tennessee)
does anyone have any experience growing them first hand, and if so, got any tips for growing them?
i've never grown luffa before, and my plan is just that once they're started, i'll probably just let the grow like wild fire, and maybe trim a few young fruits whenever i want a meal
I guess this is probably the best place to ask.
I got into gardening a few years ago and love it now I want to turn my hobby into something that can make me some money on the side. Has anyone here had success running a market garden? I live in a county where there's a nice mix of urban and rural so there are always plenty of farmers markets going on throughout the year and I want a slice of the action.
I want to know what kind of crops do the best, do specialty/novelty crops sell better than staples, and are there any legal hoops I need to jump through to start this?
I have three varieties of seed potatoes
you mean you already have them or that you have to choose what to buy ?
i posted pics of mine when i grew them in 2021, dunno about tips they are like growing cukes, very much tasteless may be better to grow the ribbed one if you want tastiness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a94uFX08ISs [Embed]
that you have to choose what to buy ?
This. Those are my options to buy.
If I had them already I'd just plant them.
Both hard and softneck garlic, shallots, dried gourds, micro greens, cut flowers, and berries are good money makers. Pumpkins, decorative corn, peppers, sweet corn and tomatoes are okay money makers. In last place are onions, potatoes, beans, carrots, and peas. Value added products can be good money makers. Like hardneck garlic powder, braided garlic and onions, chile ristas, jams, jellies, pickles, finished birdhouse gourds, and sauerkraut. I'm sure I'm missing a bunch.
Are the various lemon balm variants like mandarina and limoncello actually worth growing?
Reposting if anyone has any experience 
It's a somewhat notorious thing that 99/100 sellers are lying about the wattage of the LEDs. A plant will generally want at the very least a 100w equivalent bulb set over it. You can also do things like having the walls of the grow chamber wallpapered with a foil to reflect the light for maximum utilization.
*AHEM*
Fuck squirrels.
That is all.
i had ground squiggers kill an entire year's worth of crop once
killed every one via a rat trap with nails in it &amp; a rock (right outta my hand, busted a fucker's eye outta their skull, tossed to the ravens after which)
i'm sure they're great otherwise, but fuck did they ruin an entire harvest of a year's worth of plants 
**thats also how i learned that i'm a psychopath &amp; feel literally nothing if not joy when killing something thats inconvenienced me even slightly, so thats cool i guess**
I'm a broccoli plant in a small pot, to get myself some extra seeds and because I like the looks of the plant anyway
It's almost 2 months old now, looks like it can't support many leaves at once since the older ones are being sacrificed
Does this mean it ran out of nitrogen already or is it rootbound? Just curious what exactly causes the plants to retain more or less leaves at once
I'm a broccoli plant
I'm growing* lmao
prolly rootbound, those pots are meant for only until they start to actually grow
either find a rando place to grow it on the ground or cut the roots on the pot till they're unbound
How do I make compost from lawn clippings?
Lettuce and greens are going to be big. Fast turn over relatively high return. At least here in the states.
So several months back I "planted" a jalapeno seed, and some green onions I got from the grocery store, into my Aerogarden. The green onions grew normally for months, and the jalapeno did its thing also. However, for the past couple weeks, ever since the jalapeno plant stopped producing fruit and instead focused on ripening its peppers, the green onions have been growing like apeshit. Like no shit, I don't have a tape measure handy, but each shoot seems to be about 2.5 feet long, as long as my arm from my shoulder to my wrist. What's up with that? I'm thinking, the jalapeno plant is now no longer drawing so many resources from the shared aeroponic "pool", and so now the green onions get to use most of it, and as a result, have gone apeshit. You can see two of the shoots in this pic, there's a third that flopped over due to its own weight. There's another one growing fast as well, probably at one foot now.
What's wrong with my tomatoes?
Toss them in a pile and let the worms and other things eat them and crap them back out.
squash have sprouted
i repeat, squash have sprouted
less water, less humidity, more warm sunlight. that soil looks to be too sopping for what tomatoes prefer. They like to be just barely moist, not wet. O
Anyone here grow mushrooms in addition to their plants? Right now I've got a bucket of Oysters fruiting, two buckets of aspen chips cooking for more buckets of oysters, and one bucket of coco coir + manure cooking for p. cubensis. It's a little hard at first because you have to learn how fungus lives, but once you get going, it is so much fun.
Has anyone tried replacing chunks of their front lawn with giant shrubs/trees/etc? I don't want to mow.
I dug up one of them and broke of half of the roots and a tiny portion of the the sprout off. Did I screw myself??
Any recommendations on what to plant in my garden? I only want to grow edible plants which are either perennial, expensive in the produce department, or hard to get in good quality at the store. Currently in my garden I've got beets, basil, blueberry bushes, and maca. I'm in zone 7a.
What you should grow depends on your market but things that you can't get at the grocery store, which don't require much processing and which aren't likely to be found in backyard gardens are always a solid bet, bonus points if they're not especially time-sensitive. It's really a matter of knowing your local market but stuff like the less common berries (chokecherry, elderberry, gooseberries and currants, etc.) generally do pretty well and you can't go wrong with heirlooms of all stripes but alliums, chiles, gourds, kitchen herbs and beets are easy to manage compared to something like tomatoes. Fuck growing tomatoes; the cunts start going bad as soon as you get them off the vine and they bruise when you look at them. As well you can also grow, for lack of a better term, "ethnic produce" but that's going to be a local thing. If you live in the north woods then lingonberries and bilberries might be a hot ticket item, if you live in an area with a lot of Japanese immigrants and a permitting climate then things like mitsuba, shiso, naganegi etc. might be a good idea, in the southwest you might have a market for fresh epazote, and so on.
The various Ribes as well as elderberries are nice. Personally I'm a bit fan of chokecherries as well because they taste like home to me.
Today I pulled the bins full of container mix off the garden. Then scraped off last year's straw mulch, along with the leaves I just dump in the penned off garden, putting both in the compost. I didn't want anything keeping the ground from thawing out as I'm looking to plant the potatoes, onions and carrots next week.
There's a set of plants used especially for this purpose. They seem to be called 'groundcover' in general.
Those that come to my mind right now: cotoneaster horizontalis, creeping junipers, stonecrop, periwinkle.
They grow up to 0.5m tall and spread horizontally.
giant shrubs/trees/etc
A tree will take only as much of the lawn's area as the space occupied by its stem.
Giant shrubs will most likely need to be pruned, so instead of mowing, you'll be pruning.
Strawberries are perennial and though not exactly expensive, the ones you grow at home taste so much better than what you get at the produce section. Got about 5-6 lbs per season despite this 8'x4' bed being filled with crappy bagged topsoil and minimal fertilizer since I didn't know what I was doing. Also zone 7a.
Does anyone recognize this vine with the purple flowers? The flowers look like sweet pea but the stalk is flat.
Very nice. But what do you mean by "crappy bagged topsoil"?
Cheap, practically inert dirt. Mostly clay. I think its the dirt collected from nearby construction sites as they level the land, bagged and sold at the big box home improvement store. I was surprised they did so well, but I think by the time of that picture I'd started using a balanced amendment mix.
Just noticed my tomatoes have some black spots on them(guessing its due to bacterial specks/spots). Oddly enough, none of the leaves have these spots, only the tomatoes. How do I avoid this in the future? Shit sucks.
Well-drained, moisture-retentive, lime-free, humus-rich soil
What would a soil of this description be constituted of? Something like 2:1:2 of peat, worm casting and pumice/sand?
After filling found out I got a bunch of shitty rocks in the soil...can I still grow this season? Can I fix this situation or do I need to relocate?
Looking good. What kind of potatoes ?
They look sunburned. Did you just recently move them into full sun?
Less sand, maybe 10% pumice, more peat and a dash of charcoal
I need some help with lawn care. 
I've got a very tricky area a client failed several times to establish lawn in. 
A. It's got ten meter high walls, so gets little sun in winter and a ton in summer
B. Its exposed to frost, temperate zone, ambient -6 to 40c 
C. It will get heavy foot traffic
D. The soil doesn't drain well because of the walls foundation. 
E. It's heavily mossed, 60% moss coverage before I scarified it. 
Your first thought it probably "that's a terrible place for a lawn" and you'd be right.... but the client wants it done as a flex.
My plan is to lay a fine fescue in the hope it will quickly cover bare area and survive foot traffic, then add some lawn sand to keep moss down and improve drainage, then oversow a second kind come spring
My guerilla shallots are coming in nicely.
Very good anon
tomatoes, tobacco, cucumbers, bell peppers and few chillies
still long way until greenhouse season starts but i have some brave leftovers there testing the waters
Tub in tub greenhouse chads rise up
still need advice for this >>2571858
guerilla
?
There's no right or wrong option, on what basis would you be deciding?
Whichever you prefer eating generally
just plant all of them and harvest when the foliage starts dying off
although they all seem first/second early varieties so you should be able to harvest some in 2 months or so
If I don't want to use them immediately I often leave my shallotes in the ground after the foliage dies off, they last months if simply left in the ground.
I usually do Norland red potatoes. I got a few big ones last year. I do some in containers and some in a heavily shaded part of the garden where nothing else grows.
what I'm getting form this is that nobody knows...
damn. that doesn't help me decide, I guess I will get one randomly and hope for the best.
Only question if I should get 10kg, or 20kg of seed potatoes.
Watering the beans this morning
well got 20kg of the "birgit" variety, god help me
chives and walking onions easily survived the winter and are already harvestable
parsley, mint, garlic coming up
overwintered thyme is probably dead but it's okay
perennial arugula already getting big enough for snacking
direct-sown beets, carrots, dill, and coriander finally popping up
peppers, eggplants, lettuce, leeks, kale, Swiss chard, and supermarket garlic (for the tops) all sprouted and growing strong
rose bushes trimmed and growing healthy buds
Autumn Beauty sunflowers sprouted and healthy
overwintered figs reawakening from their slumber
just sowed out tomatoes, feeling confident about germination
cucumbers, zucchini, beans, and zinnias a few weeks away from sowing 
Sometimes you can just feel it, bros. Not counting my chickens but I think it's going to be a good year in the garden.
How come trees, grass, and wild plants grow back year on year but any worthwhile crop needs supplementing with nutrients every 4 weeks?
Is it just a matter of their unsustainable rate of nutrient uptake?
let a bunch of weedy berry-bearing plants like honeysuckles fill empty space
I now have like 5 fruit trees growing out of the middle of said plants
Birds.
They're bred to get big and nutrients increase the yield. You can grow without it but you end up with tiny results.
'Tis the time of the year. 
Spring is always the best. 
Then comes summer with extreme heats, droughts, floods, winds... and suddenly you are back to having only apples just like last year cause those are immortal and fantasizing how next year is finally going to be the veg year.
I love them. Also finally pulled mulch off of my seed garlic planted last fall. Feels good bros
cut the roots on the pot till they're unboun
Works with houseplants, but vegetables? Not too sure
buy sunflower seeds cause I want to grow some this year
seeds a all tiny and black
I got the oil seeds didnt I? Fuck. The white and black striped ones that are bigger are the ones for human consumption aren't they? Am I fucked? Will they actually grow bigger than the seeds I got? Or do I go and try to find another variety that is human eating size?
Seed variety is "choco sun" by the way.
try to start a worm farm
big worm eats all the small worms
I've grow black oil sunflower. They look like sunflowers and grow 6+ ft tall. Not to different than any other variety I've grown
eat the big worms
 any worthwhile crop needs supplementing
You can just grow varieties/cultivars or species that don't need supplementing. It's your choice.
Either in my garden, or in my parents' garden, the plums, apples, a pear, a mulberry, a chestnut and an apricot trees grow and fruit without supplementing.
Same for hazelnuts, currants, a gooseberry, raspberries, a pair of actinidia arguta and wild strawberries (that randomly popped in my lawn and grow and fruit despite being regularly mowed).
Even some kitchen utility plants such as chives, oregano, thyme, sage, winter savory, not to mention mint and balm, grow by themselves (and most of these spread naturally invading my lawn).
None of these are of a variety that has been specifically created for intensive gardening. They probably would grow more / larger fruits if they were supplemented, but hey, with pruning, weeding (and occasional spraying with fungicides and/or pesticides) I harvest more than I can eat.
and occasional spraying with fungicides and/or pesticides
Any anons exchange seeds?
just checking up before I go to bed
I never heard of those potato varieties before. They must be european varieties ? I would have bought couple kilos of each to see what one grows the best, tastes the best, yields the most, and which one stores the longest.
Update on the lawn care:
Using commercial product to weed and feed the lawns to wipe out dandilions, going ahead with fescue
Interesting setup.
How are you controlling humidity? What kind of pots are you using?
Not him, but I'm fully organic and still rely on both. With good management you don't need much, but good management IS using them when needed. 
Copper based spray for fruit trees is essential, you can't control weeds in paths without a contact spray, some lawns need fungicide and so do fruit trees.
This "organic" thing is total bullshit, 
Synthetic chemicals are often better because they are pure, "organic" products can be as harmful as anything else.
Sustainable land management is very real, and it doesn't exclude pesticide use. Many pests, diseases etc aren't even native to begin with.
I can't wait for the day that I'll have a fresh tomato again. I was amazed last year when I ate my first tomato directly off the vine. The taste is 1000x more intense than (most) store bought tomatoes. Tomato sandwiches here I come again.
Not him, but I'm fully organic and still rely on both.
full organic
using pesticides and fungicides
thanks for explaining as to why nobody treats organic seriously at the store, because this is the mindset and you end up paying more for the same shit.
Synthetic chemicals are often better because they are pure, "organic" products can be as harmful as anything else.
I like how your approach can only reach a solution of "what do I spray it with, i'v got to spray it with s-o-m-e-t-h-i-n-g"
was going to say the same thing. Had this happen with some beans that I forgot to move out of direct light while I was potting up
humidity I just let naturally occur usually 60% during the day and 40% at night. I have fans above to to give the plants some breeze and one on the intake to keep temps around 82. 
I use soil blocks
how many potatoes are you planning on eating?
20kg of seed potatoes could give you around 150-200kg to harvest
peas sprouted
carrots sprouted
spinach sprouted
corn sprouted
squash sprouted
chard sprouted
spring onions sprouted
herbs sprouted
so far i've only been harvesting mizuna leaves but its coming bros
found a fat worm in my garden, and i mean faaaat
also
Giant Gippsland Earthworm
This worm is native to Australia, and it is known to be one of the largest worms in the world at a typical length of between thirty and forty inches long
how many potatoes are you planning on eating?
ALL of the potatoes.
No but really, it depends on how my harvest goes.
I'm not going to baby my potatoes and they will mostly have to fight for themselves, so I imagine the yield per plant will be greatly reduced. Another thing is the initial growing conditions won't be super luxurious either.
So they will be challenged to put it lightly.
Anyway I will go and dig(with no machinery) as much as I can, plant as much as I can, and then harvest and eat as much as I can.
My retardation knows no bounds.
will black containers cook the roots of my strawberries?
Probably not but it depends on the size and how hot your area gets. They'll probably dry out faster.
Just shoveled in a ton of overpriced but very sexy smelling compost yesterday. Planted some herbs, zucchini squash, some hot pepper seeds that are probably a few years out of date just to see what happens, lettuce, and leaving room for tomatoes once there's no more frost danger. Potatoes on the left. Plans for a motte behind it to let carrots and turnip till the soil for me forthcoming. Nicer looking keyhole garden next year. Bonsai material saved from the mower in small pot. 
I've taken to doing what the guerilla gardeners do in cities and plant shade tolerant and soil fixing crops wherever I have room. The yield isn't great but you can plant a whole lot more outside of traditional rows and beds.
Front lawn gardening update. I’m the anon who has a wild flower and pollinator yard. 
The city sent someone out to finally speak to me in February. They were arguing the state flower was a weed. 
I asked for a legal definition of a weed
legal definition of mulch
showed her 2 state laws for conservation that void any municipal laws
the city manager was supposed look at these items and come back to walk my yard with me
It is now more than 2 months later. Are they leaving me alone? Have they told turf lawn boomers they are fucked?
eventually, I grew to hate them.
FREE MEAT!
Once you notice that your plum suddenly withers (what?!), so you take a close look why all leafs are hanging down limply, and you notice that they simply got sucked out by a legion of aphids installed and guarded by a colony of ants, then there is no sane solution other than spraying the tree with a systemic pesticide.
Once you notice that your pine lost half of its needles overnight and the reminder of your tree moves, so you take a close look and you notice pine sawfly larvae, then there is no sane solution other than spraying the tree with a pesticide (unless you've got a couple of hours to remove them by hand).
And please explain to me how to grow a peach without spraying it with fungicides every year...
Hold strong. Fuck these fucking boomer faggots.
The whole organic vs standard farming stuff is not about no chemicals at all, but rather no chemicals when there exists an alternative solution other than "burn everything down".
The problem with standard farming is that you spray regardless whether it's necessary, and you use the cheapest and strongest shit that is still allowed.
It's like "oh, it's mid April, so I must spray all my apple trees with that pesticide" without even checking whether the target insects are present anywhere nearby.
A good example of what the standard farming does and the organic is required not to do is dessication.
This is essentially killing plants such as legumes, some grains, sunflowers, corn etc. with herbicides shortly before harvest.
It's a purely economic thing – when a plant dies, it speeds up seed development, so they ripen more simultaneously, and the plant dries, so this makes harvesting less complicated and thus cheaper.
Does any farmer care that you consume the whatever substance that killed the plant? The officially allowed ones are said to be harmless for human, but glyphosate is cheaper and legal to buy, so guess what the farmers use...
why the obsession with potatoes?
did not for me on even on fist sized pots but i grow them in partial sun, strawberries, raspberries, blackcuckrrants all sunburn in summer in my place
This is getting ridiculous. Someone is feeding these fuckers.
One of the biggest blackpills to swallow. Knowing this and knowing a manority of humanity doesn't have the land/resources to grow their own food or buy everything organic sickens me. Especially when the majority don't even realise it themselves.
fuck 'em
he thinks it's only potatoes
I do this with everything I plant
blessed with free meat
complains
Someone is feeding these fuckers.
It's your isn't it?
Again this covers why, I find "organic" to be bullshit most of the time, because it still gets sprayed with shit when I expect a clean product.
Which is the entire reason I grow stuff myself because that's the only way I can guarantee the quality of the product by guaranteeing the quality of the soil and the eco system in the soil/land.
pardon my ignorance but
aphids, less nitrogen, lady bugs
sawfly larva, some kind of bird that eats them, maybe woodpeckers?
peaches without fungicides, don't know shit about growing peaches in particular but healthier plants resist diseases and pests better, so maybe up the BRIX scale of your plants?
aphids, less nitrogen, lady bugs
Lol, you just proved you never grown anything for real. Lacewings, ladybugs, aphid midges larvae and most hover flies larvae and even some spiders are actively attacked by ants once they try to eat the aphids, so when the aphids are bred by ants, all those natural aphid predators are either eaten or thrown off the plant by ants.
sawfly larva, some kind of bird that eats them, maybe woodpeckers?
Sawfly larvae are capable of defoliating a large part of your tree before the birds notice their presence. And you probably don't have enough birds around to eat all the larvae before the larvae eat your tree.
Pest of this kind can even literally eat a whole forest. The pine beauty has eaten approximately 220 000 ha (850 square miles) of pine forest in my country in 1922-1923. The only thing that killed the pine beauties back then was some epidemic disease that could spread for the pine beauties were literally everywhere.
don't know shit about growing peaches
So shut up.
Except from fungicides there is only one way to prevent the peach leaf curl: let no water – even morning dew – touch the peach tree since November until mid May. So you either afford a greenhouse with controlled humidity, or you spray the peach trees with fungicides, or you have leaf curl.
Some peach varieties don't die when they have leaf curl every season, but those sold for their tasty fruits survive less than five years if you don't fight the leaf curl.
So shut up.
Have you grown every plant on earth? No, so shut up.
any suggestions on fostering morels? last season i got buckets full on my property, this year i've only seen like half a dozen.
i'm not sure if there's anything better than a steak with sautéed morels, i got spoiled last year.
There is two types of sunflowers. Confection and oilers. Confection are used for eating in or without the shell. And they're normally have black and gray stripes. And they have thicker shells than oilers. Oilers are normally black. And have smaller thinner shells compared to confectionary sunflowers. You can still eat oiler seeds. Its just harder to crack the shell since they're smaller and the kernels are smaller. 
Giant sunflowers don't always produce giant kernels. Most of the time you'll get a giant shell with small to average sized kernals. If you're looking for big kernels. Look for Royal Hybrid varieties. Btw choco sun is a dwarf ornamental sunflower. It only gets about a foot tall.
What's the most retard-proof fruit tree to grow between apple, pear and plum?
They all seem like good candidates for my conditions but I can't decide
Btw choco sun is a dwarf ornamental sunflower. It only gets about a foot tall.
nice, so the packet literally lies as it says it grows to almost 10'
Giant sunflowers don't always produce giant kernels. Most of the time you'll get a giant shell with small to average sized kernals. If you're looking for big kernels. Look for Royal Hybrid varieties.
What if I just get sunflower seeds from an organic shop and plant those? Assuming they sprout, would they bear the same sized seeds as the ones I plant?
Russian Mammoth, Mongolian, and Skyscraper sunflowers that have bigger seeds than oilers and you can get organic versions of them.
Apple trees need a different variety to cross pollinate. Either another apple or crab apple will do. But you need them to bloom at the same time. There are some self fertile pears and plums out there. Also depending where you live you may need a really hardy fruit tree to survive harsh winters. I'd say pear, plum, then apple in that order. Stick with dwarf or semi dwarf unless you want a 20-30' tall fruit tree. If you're dead set on apple trees. Look into Liberty or Freedom varieties. Great apples and they are very resistant to scab, rust, fire blight, and powdery mildew. Don't fall for the honeycrisp is great for starters meme. It doesn't tolerate high heat and it gets sunburn, also it has low vigor and a thin skin. Its susceptible to fire blight, fly speck, sooty blotch, bitter pit, and mildew. You also have to thin the fruits otherwise you'll have tiny fruits. And that goes for all fruit trees.
Hey, some anon has literally written "I know shit about peaches, but hurr durr you grow peaches wrong". Don't you see what's wrong with that?
I'd add to that to check what are the common diseases for pear, apple and plum in your area.
There where I live the pears are attacked by the pear rust that severely damages most pear varieties and can't be avoided if you have an infected juniper within 1km, so I'd say an apple/plum is easier here. Wikipedia calls that disease 'European pear rust', so it might not even threaten you.
If they are sharing the same soil as in a pot or planter now that the jalapeno is focusing on ripening it isn't drawing as much from the soil to grow which is allowing your onions to go nuts. 
Plants are in a battle to the death. Ever notice what happens if you plant too many plants close together or maybe try and plant under a large tree?
Godspeed, anon. Hold the line.
I wish I had room for more but I planted a few pots with some native pollinator-friendly plants last year. Blunt Leaf Mountain Mint, Bee Balm and Swamp Milkweed. Germinating Sundial Lupine this year as well, it's just started to come up. I was worried that the milkweed didn't pull through due to the ground being too dry but it's just coming in a little slower than the mint
Oh, I saw that my local nursery had a few apple trees that were supposedly self-fertile but yeah from looking it up again that does sound more risky than the other ones tbqh
Yeah I was too focused on looking up hardiness, soil conditions and stuff like that so I didn't think of checking for diseases and seems like scab is kind of a big deal here.
In the end I guess I'll look for a resistant dwarf plum tree, anyway I have a montmorency cherry tree that seems to be doing well and I was starting to lean ever so slightly towards plum simply because I like the fruit a little more, thanks frens
godspeed, hope they eat shit
Cant wait to get these sluts out. Hopefully tomorrow. They were in the sun for about 4 hours yesterday, supposed to get some strong sun today.
scab
That's quite easy to manage. If you regularly dispose of fallen leafs and remove all dead fruits &amp; any leftover leafs from the trees late autumn, the scab damage will stay within acceptable limits.
The leafs can even be dug underground, and after a couple of seasons they pose no threat. Also, if the leafs decompose over winter, they no longer pose a threat, so one of the cheap mass-scale strategies is to spray trees with urea once the leafs start falling down, this provides an extra boost for the bacteria decomposing leafs.
"just a little quick trip to the nursery to see what they have this year I swear I'm not gonna buy anything "
buy 400 bucks worth
Hey, some anon has literally written "I know shit about peaches, but hurr durr you grow peaches wrong"
Surely can't be this >>2573125 anon then:
pardon my ignorance but
don't know shit about growing peaches in particular but
so I would like you to quote and link the posts that "literally" says and I quote your post:
"I know shit about peaches, but hurr durr you grow peaches wrong"
planted fava beans 2 and a half weeks ago
they still haven't come up
I know it's cold and all but damn.... did I just put them to deep or something, this is ridiculous.
Also does anybody know what plant this is?
Why THE FUCK have my strawberries stopped growing ever since I repotted them and put them outside. It pisses me off.
could be shock, btw i bought a bare-root pomegranate a month ago and it still hasnt sprouted leaves
Hello /out/doorsmen. I have an issue.
So I recently got really into the idea of composting since I figured that it would be a way better method of acquiring fertilizer. So I decided to buy a square foot of mulch to use as an ingredient, red mulch to be specific. Now at the time I did not do enough research to realize that dyed mulches can actually fuck up a good compost pile. Is there a way to save this mulch so I can use it as a compost? Please help
why would you buy mulch to make compost?
Should probably mention that I very much rushed and overthought this whole process. Point and laugh I know
Most colored mulches are dyed with harmless dyes, like iron oxide-based dyes for red or carbon-based dyes for black and dark brown. Some cheap dyes, however, can be dyed with harmful or toxic chemicals.
you're probably fine
"probably"
Regardless. I read that mushrooms can aid in breaking down the dyed material in mulch to make it more digestible for compost worms. So maybe I can gather some mushrooms and spread them into the compost?
Or I'm looking too deep into it and I should just use the red-dyed compost for my non-edible plants.
This is what people don't understand with the "Durr don't use pesticide or fungicide"
Yea, good luck trying to save a vineyard from an invasive chink fucking lanternfly without them you stupid cuckhold.
It would been easier and cheaper to just find twigs and branches to add to your compost pile. It's going to take a long time for the wood to break down. You could speed it up by hot composting.
cousin gathers up all the tree branches, leaves, some straw, put them in a pile, pours gasoline over them and sets them on fire 
to "clean up the place"
ask them why not simply leave them in a pile and keep adding nitrogen rich materials to make compost
ahhh but it has like wood and it will take forever to break down
I swear.... It feels like im taking crazy pills. Why would somebody waste the effort and energy to gather up things that would decompost, pile them up, and then waste gasoline to burn them, and smoke up the entire place. And waste good compost to be.
it just boggles my mind but everybody treats me like I'm the retard for objecting to such things.
Had the same conversation with my mother. 
"It's ugly, it has to be tidy" she said. Pointless to talk to these people.
he's right they would take forever to break down
also ashes are good fertilizer too, composting is not the only way to make the nutrients available
Spring finally comes
Sowing like a fucking boss
This is my job now
boggles my mind that people don't like doing the things I like to do
Maybe you should offer to clear the material and transport it to your own property to compost. Seems like a missed opportunity for free composting materials.
imagine removing free fertizer of your property and then burning it, sending smoke and ash into the air
CANT IMAGINE LIVING THIS WAY
booohooo give me a practical reason why you need that tree branch in a pile to breakdown TODAY instead of over the course of a couple of years? Wheres the hurry? Just pile it into the compost pile and take a piss on it.
also ashes are good fertilizer too
Ashes are akliline and peaky in its application, now you have to haul that shit back thats stained with gasoline on your stuff.
Whats the bloody point of moving it there, moving it back, setting it on fire etc.
You people really want to do something huh, then complain about how gardening is sooo much work, while simultaneously creating work where there is none.
I will do the minimum work possible, while doing the maximum of required work.
You can only give advice, and that's where things usually end. When you're more in line with someone, it becomes fun to learn new things from eachother and in turn you respect eachother for it. But most people are not in line. They're retards claiming other people to be retards. Always avoid these people if you can.
You can only give advice, and that's where things usually end.
Well I politedly brought up the issue and mentioned that it's just slow release fertilizer that will rot and feed the land anyway and if you want to speed it up, then moisture and nitrogen will speed it up. There is no real gain to tidying up the land by robbing it of the nutrients like leaves, straw, branches and so on.
And again, it's extra work, but whats the gain? They would probably gain more from just sitting back relaxing in a chair and taking in the peaceful scenery. Instead they "rape" themselves and the land and air.
The senselessness of it all bothers me inside.
what's the gain?
Pile of shit that I don't want to be there isn't there. Brush piles provide shelter for nuisance animals like gophers. Brush piles look bad.
who cares if it looks bad, they're raping the land!
Not really. Also, in the same way you don't care about the appearance of a shitty Brush pile, your cousins don't care about composting like you do. 
Offer to Take the brush to your own property to compost. Win-win.
I'm not talking about their property, I'm talking about my property.
been here for 2 years and never saw anybody mention rock phosphate before, now that I know about it I see a bunch of 10 year old posts on forums and old videos talking about how it's the best thing you could put on your tomatoes
does anybody else have experience with it? i bought a big bag of it but it was fifty dollars, that's probably what scares a lot of people off it
but if all you need is a small handful for each transplant it will probably last a while
You let people come onto your property and burn your brush? If it's your property they are in the wrong for burning against your wishes. You should make it clear that they cannot come onto your property and set fires
You let people come onto your property and burn your brush?
I let some family members and relatives come over to enjoy nature at my place.
 You should make it clear that they cannot come onto your property and set fires
My guess it's their way of "helping" or whatever, but it's literally doing empty work that is probably a net negative on the fertility of my soil.
I only noticed it after they set fire to it, because I was busy gardening.
As long as you have made your request clear, there should be no problems in the future. Glad you worked it out.
Good morning. Long time lurker first time poster. My first vegetable garden. I tilled a garden that's a 12x20. I haven't planted anything in the garden yet, but have started seedlings indoors. When I first tilled it, the soil was nice and loose for about two inches deep .Now it seems it is maybe half an inch and is compacted in most places. 
Will this affect my plants at all? Should I till it again?
god damn I love the explosive growth with soil blocks
*smacks lips* they really rolling out the black carpet out for us huh?
Can anyone help me identify this bug? I'm afraid it feeds on my pear tree.
Today I checked why some of my pear saplings look slightly withered, and found this insect trying to hide behind a twig. I didn't see any other signs of other pest or reason that could do the damage. I'm in central Europe.
The bug run around the twig to stay away from me, and it looks somewhat similar to hopper nymphs. Does not jump, does not fly.
Sorry for the quality, this bug does not want to sit still and it's hard to make a good photo of a 4mm bug. The background is millimetre paper for reference.
(I put that insect in my fridge, so I can take fresh photos if these were insufficient. Cooled down insects make better models.)
Leafhopper larvae
it looks somewhat similar to hopper nymphs
Leafhopper larvae
That was my wild guess, but I didn't find any information on these feeding on pears. I doubt that some retarded leafhopper mistook my pear for another tree species.
That's why I'm still looking forward to identify what it is.
do you fert them ?
yup. About a week after the true leaves start we start feeding them 1/2 strength GH floranova grow for seedlings. Just started yesterday. 
the only ferts they have until then is just the composted cow manure which is .5 .5 .5
Is this a Tamarack tree or did my tree just bounce back from death? I was planning on digging it up after I thought it died last summer (thankfully I procrastinated) until I saw the green last week. Any advice on how to care for it's troubled center? Or is this it's normal cycle?
Read some of the guides in the pastebin in OP >>2571710 (OP)
If it were my garden, I would spread a moisture control on top (like shredded hay or something like that) and only loosen up the soil in the immediate area where I plant my seedlings. Most vegetables don't have deep/wide roots, so no need to till the whole garden unless you are doing a high density planting.
tamarack -> wikipedia -> American larch.
I can't tell if the American version of larch does the same, but the European one shed the needles earlier than it's supposed to if it's too dry. So if you had, say, a month of no rain, then it would explain that your larch lost its needles in summer rather than in autumn.
My garlic started coming up. So far the only thing planted. I took down my chicken wire perimeter so I can give the main garden a rototilling. I've been just turning it with a pitch fork the past few years. Potatoes, onions and carrots should go in early next week.
To be fair, marigolds explode no matter what you plant them in
Awesome. All my garlic is almost sprouted. The music and armenian are in first place for sprouting. While the elephant and softneck are in last place for sprouting. I lost some garlic to the cold but its too early to tell.
two months in standard plugs...

oh look it's pepper tub anon
Transplanted alot today from 1 gallon fabric pots to 5, 7 and 10 gallon pots
Half the peppers are not pictured

how young are your saplings?
these things usually feed on grass, they poke the stems and suck through
when you see foam on grass at the junctions of leaves and stems it's their drool in which they lay their eggs
seems unlikely to me they would feed on something which contains lignin such as your saplings, they usually stick to tender stuff
how young are your saplings?
I grafted them a year ago, now they're ~60cm tall and grow new twigs.
when you see foam on grass at the junctions of leaves and stems it's their drool in which they lay their eggs
Not all hoppers do that, and not only hoppers do that (I've heard that grasshoppers do that as well).
Those hoppers that do are apparently called 'spittlebugs' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrophoridae), and spittlebugs present in my country have green nymphs.
seems unlikely to me they would feed on something which contains lignin such as your saplings, they usually stick to tender stuff
I wouldn't say so, rose leafhoppers feed on roses, rhytidodus species feed on aspen etc. 
I'm quite concerned about this because most of these f**king hoppers transmit diseases from tree to tree, including viral diseases that don't spread naturally.
charles downing is pretty comfy
uh anyone?
newfag here in 6a, is it too late for me to grow carrots????
Just put "6a carrots" into a search engine. I don't know American meme zones but apparently you can sow them until July.
First pick is lettuce 2nd is peas
2nd looks more like a broad bean imo
2nd is peas, but are you sure the first one is lettuce?
I highly doubt it's broad bean
Went out to get my seed starting cups from the garden and found this guy. No idea what it is. Anyone wanna guess?
some really quick growth from the 2in into the 4in blocks
Spot the difference
Know the difference. It could save your life(not really)
Looking good. I'm thinking about 3d printing a soil blocker. I'm hesitant because I'm pretty sure I would go Popeye on it and break the handle on the first use.
thats a pretty sweet blocker. Is that 3d printed as well? 
I've seen people make them out of wood as well. I would think with wood you'd have to lacquer it to prevent sticking.
Huston, we have lift off. I repeat, strawberries are a go.
Interesting.
Marigolds are always my first to germinate.
Is block vs plug the only difference between yours? No other factors?
Asking because those looks really small for 2 months. My extremely rootbound marigolds in plugs which I haven't been able to pot up are about 8" (200mm) tall with 5-6 sets of true leaves. Planted first week of March.
The ones I planted one week ago have their first set of true leaves just now popping
Yeah it's 3d printed. I haven't printed it yet, just I plan to this week. I might have to find a wood or metal handle for it. I don't trust the last for a part that will have to take that much force.
If you're in US Zone 4-6 MIgardener is good. Lots of content over the years. Good info which has helped me a ton
Is block vs plug the only difference between yours? No other factors?
no other difference 
Never had luck with plugs, I tried like 10 years ago, but switched to blocks after. 
these are in plugs because they are for family and they are pains in the asses with wanting HUGE plants. Had to start like 1000 plants this year so I thought it might be easier with that amount in plug but for me, it wasn't.
Would you be able to just print the press feet and then use a dowel and put a big screw up the middle into the dowel?
forgot to add, started sunflowers and corn early this week. I wanted to try an addition to what I've seen a few times. I added bloodmeal into the mix, interested in seeing any difference.
Haven't thought about how yet, but I will definitely take that approach. Will also print everything with 100% infill for the least about) amount of flex an high strength. Will post pictures in a couple days when it's done.
nice growth anon 
cool keep us updated.
RED Gardens is not exactly 'comfy' like e.g. Charles Dowding but I like his videos, a lot of information in them.
forgot to post this a few weeks ago. 
The lockdowns really fucked up a lot of people in the head.

My guess is that this is a maple seeding. Probably a sycamore (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_pseudoplatanus).
Notice the stalk is reddish, the cotyledon is oblong, and the true leaves have opposite arrangement and start to resemble maple leaves.
If you let the true leaf form fully, you can confirm whether my guess is right.
The winged fruits of maples make these trees more invasive than most weeds...
Is that GROUND ELDER i see in the background??
Tell me, is the ground elder with us in the garden right now? >>2573948
Moved the compost bin to another end of the allotment, got a nice cross section of it all before it was all turned.
Is Gary Pilarchik /hgm/ approved?

Does anyone else notice the spiritual/intentional component of gardening? Every year i get more confident at gardening and it seems like things that ima work now that wouldn’t work when I started. I don’t think it’s just skill, I think my force of Will has strengthened with my confidence and plants are more likely to grow because of that.

There is something wonderful about it. I'm agnostic, but I always think that if god is real he's not in a church, he's in a garden.
Love gardening
Hate direct sunlight
Hate heat
Anyone else? I do most of my gardening when it's cloudy or in like 90 minutes at the end of the day because being in the sun is fucking miserable.
Yeah I've been living in a mountainous forested area for about a year where the air is nice and cool and the sunlight is usually quite subdued because of all the trees and it's so comfy. Way less things can grow well in these conditions but I consider figuring that out part of the fun now.
Nice guess! I'm thinking so too. I'll let it grow and post when leaves grow.
They're gay
Gardening feels so complicated im so retarded
what's a cheap general purpose fertilizer i can use on everything?
Manure tea.
Fish emulsion
Yeah you are. It’s not complicated.
10-10-10. Between $20-$25 for 40 pounds at most garden centers and hardwarth4rwpe stores.
Fuck you it feels really complicated
Put shit into ground. 
Water it. 
It grows. 
It's not exactly hard to understand this process anon. 
Your ancestors 20 thousand years ago managed to pull this off. 
There are even ants that are farming mushrooms.
start small and simple. find a few plants that grow in your area. plant and watch, make observations, come back here and report. the following year apply what you have learnt from the year before. bingo
While other anon is being an oversimplifying dingus it's really not that complicated. Think of it as cooking, at first you should use recipes (growing instructions on what you want to grow provided by nursery or gardening websites) and with time and experience you'll start having a good idea what works and what doesn't and having a better hand with the more complicated things
Wait until the last freeze date
Spend ~$50 on soil, bags and miracle-gro
Spend another ~$30 on some peppers and cherry tomatoes
Place plants into soil
Water roughly twice a week
Wa la, you have successfully gardened. You didn't need a greenhouse or a rototiller or grow lamps or to worry about your soil PH or companion plantings or ANYTHING. Will it make the cover of Sunset? No. Will you enjoy it? Probably. Will it be a learning experience? You bet. Unless you live somewhere with like an 80-day growing season or you fuck up colossally (like going away for a week in august without having someone water your plants) you're pretty much guaranteed to get some kind of return on your investment and from there you can decide if you want to do it again.
I think this Friday I can transplant my plants outside, I'm looking forward to it!
I know its 
DUDE WEED
but this chart is pretty accurate, most seedlings can tolerate light up to about 300PPFD, most vegetative plants max out at 800PPFD without additional CO2. Leafy greens usually need about 300, 200 is rather low. Only invest above 600 if you NEED to fruit/flower something that you cant just do in a pot outside, lighting gets expensive. 
IGNORE PAR
IGNORE LUMENS
PPF IS YOUR GOD
PPF = umol/s
PPFD = umol/m^2/s
umol/s can be calculated of the lights umol/J rating x the Wattage. So a 24W Fluorescent bulb @ 1.4umol/J will produce 33.6 PPF. 
This should be provided by any LED grow light manufacturer, if they don't tell you what the umol/J or umol/W rating is in the spec sheet don't even consider buying it. Other types of lights are too inconsistent to say exactly. 
Ali express shit is ALL false advertising. I don't know the brands in your country but I guarantee you have a hydroponics store within 30km of you if you're near a city, go there. Online brands like mars hydro and pro-gro are good, steer clear of spyderfarm/viparspectra/thin looking boards, they false advertise. Most drivers for 100W+ LED lights are at least the size of a small book.
Fluorescent bulbs
1.2 to 1.6 umol/W
HPS/CMH 
1.6 to 1.9 umol/W
COB LED 
1.6 to 2.3 umol/W
SMD LED 
1.9 to 3.0 umol/W
23 x 66cm
0.15sqm
90umol for 600PPFD
30-50W LED 
Obviously the light dissipates with the inverse square law, so these PPFD values are usually standardized for 60cm distance. 
If you want to start cheaply, get fluorescent bulbs with a driver rack, 24W x4 or anything else that gets you close to 100W. Do stick with SMD LEDs though if you are going to buy an LED. 100W SMD LED should never cost more than about $130 USD. Fluros probably less than $60.

It's literally tending a garden, it's pretty contemplative and mystic. Chan Buddhism has you tending gardens, mystics love using it as a metaphor in poetry. Meta-skills are also a thing, learning how to learn carries over into other fields. I can't even talk about it metaphorically, it bears tangible fruits and will wither and die if you don't tend it.
Can you elaborate? Like others said, basic gardening is as easy as putting a plant in soil and watering it. What are you doing that is complicated?
My mother-in-law thinks that gardening is “complicated” because she is neurotic and thinks she needs to have every single part of a the process correct to get any good results. She constantly asks me completely worthless questions like how small to chop table scraps before putting them in the compost. She also never accomplished anything in the garden because she worries over the minutiae so much it paralyzes her. I have spent years saying “just get out there and plant something, just make a compost bed, just start some seeds, you will learn with experience!” No dice. She’s just neurotic and it can’t be cured.
You sound like her. Don’t be. If you think gardening is too complicated, but you still want to garden, by best advice is to do something that makes you completely uncomfortable, just do something without paying attention to almost any details. Go to the store and just buy a bunch of plants, let your only criteria be “they look cool” and then come home and plant them. Water then regularly and watch them grow or die. Take notes. The experience will help you more than anything.
My personal rule is always plant at least one thing that is retard proof and sure to succeed with minimal effort in your climate.
Then also plant at least one thing that is likely to fail due to not being optimal climate, fussy or whatever, but you like it or are interested in it.
You need guaranteed success to feel good, but you also need to explore and bush the boundaries or possibility.
Have killed many rare plants trying to push my climate zone boundaries, but some things can be surprising. Been growing bananas and other tropicals in a Mediterranean climate
the plants are certainly ready
I think gardening can be infinitely complex or extremely simple. You should only worry about the complexity if you are experienced and want to control details because it is fun. Let the complexity grow with you as a gardener. Do what they said and begin with some plants, and probably one of them should be idiot proof. When you have experience watering a plant and watching it grow, think about what aspect you enjoyed, what would you like to improve on? Soil quality? Get a bunch of pots and different soils and start testing germ and growth rates. Garden aesthetics? Build a diy raised bed. Composting? Start piling yard waste. 
There’s a million ways to go, but you should always start simple and let your complexity grow with your experience.
Making compost is rewarding. This is my first ever compost.
raise beds
bah, now lowered beds on the other hand...
Any tips on turning these little apple boys into trees?
You can graft onto them once they are a few years old. Apple seeds are not true to type, and unless it was an intentional hybrid seed your grocery store apples arent going to yield you very good genetics 
I think you can get a grafted apple tree for like $30, try that instead
Dont listen to this >>2574653 guy. I fucking hate the gardening redditor's favorite saying that you shouldnt plant your own apples because "they dont grow true to type!!!1!!". Fuck 'em. Take the Johnny Appleseed pill and have fun experimenting. You can always graft later should you want to.
lol
At least seek out good genetics if you really want to fuck around with breeding, go and get the farmers market varieties sold by the 70yr old johnny appleseeds, there's some good heritage genes in there, some even dying out. Just know that if you're only planting Red Delicious Costco Edition seeds you're going to spend 5 years on more mediocre fruit. Select your winners, you'll be able to tell which trees are worth keeping and which ones aren't after their 2nd spring. Try and grow them out in at least a 15L pot. If you have the space and you don't live in Alaska they should be ready to plant out after ~2 years, mulch heavily and protect the buds from frosts etc. When they fruit after a couple of years test your trees and breed your favorites, gotta make sure you don't just harvest Open Pollinated seeds, gotta isolate the flowers and label the fruit so you know which cross is which. Mothers are usually more dominant than Fathers, but you will get probably 2-4 dominant phenotypes from each batch of crosses. If you really cant plant them in the ground, I've seen apple trees fruit successfully in 50L pots, but that's with a grafted dwarf variety with lots of liquid fertilizer and TLC
Just seeds from apples I ate.
I was planning on growing these and waiting to see what they produce before grafting on some pink lady branches to the less tasty trees.
That should give me the variety needed for cross pollination right?
Will I get a deep taproot if I've planted in the dirt pods? The last time I tried this rabbits killed my seedlings so I think I'm going to replant into larger pots until they're sturdy enough not to die.
I will definitely hit up the farmers market and get some good seeds. Thank you so much for the tips!
I tried uploading the screenshot I took but it said 'no'
The more the merrier with OP breeding. Diversity over quantity, you can get some wild stuff! Get some welded wire sheets and make a shield when they go outside, I don't know if rabbits ring-bark plants but you should probably protect. Go all out on your potting soil too, trees really appreciate investment in the soil as they usually sit in the same pot for years
Cross pollination is a crapshoot with apples, there are pollination charts for named cultivars, but OP seed can be completely random, if your neighbors have apples though the bees will do that job for you.

Groovy. Thanks!
I'd love to get some bees some day as well.
as long as we are talking about apple varieties, I feel like I want to jump in and mention my favorite apple variety, really I prefer these over all others by a big margin.

Now I don't know which exactly one it is. But it looks like >>2574672 that, has a very juicy taste to it, and is best eaten just a bit early, when the skin has turned white like in that image, but the apple still retains strong flavor, slight acidic taste to it.
If let to ripen too much on the tree or after picked, it turns starchy, dry and loses flavor.
Noticed this kale springing up in my hedge's undergrowth a little bit ago. Got me to thinking, I wonder if I could grow spinach and lettuce later into the summer if I planted them under the hedge for shade? I think the hedge's full summer foliage might choke out too much light though.
Thanks for the info!
I guess it's time to find some 50W smd lights. 
Do you need some cooling? The space is small.
I have a branch from a raspberry bush. What can I do for it to survive and grow?
stick it in water
doesnt starting squash in blocks stunt their growth?
my roots nearly clear my 5 inch pots before the first true leaves have developed
not with soil blocks. I do peas and beans as well and don't have any issues. Also you don't get transplant shock.
Breaks my heart but I'll have to kill the lil homie. My raspberry bush is spreading but I want to plant my tomatoes in there.
First, some trivia.
It usually takes about a dozen of years from starting a seedling to its first fruit.
You need enough space to grow multiple trees to get one that tastes good.
These issues are what deters most people from growing apple trees from seeds. If you have space and patience – go for it.
If you don't have space &amp; patience, then do graft them.
And yes, cross-breeding nice trees yields better results.
Grafting apple trees is easy. You can graft a 1 year old sapling in late winter / very early spring (splice grafting). Don't aim for budding, not worth waiting for when you use a generative rootstock. Keep in mind that random rootstock will likely produce a full-size tree (rather than semi-dwarf or dwarf one), and you might need to wait longer for fruits.
 turning these little apple boys into trees
Growing apple trees from a seed is easy; they survive as long as they don't get overgrown by weeds and have sufficient water.
Any standard means for helping plants grow works for them. Calamities such as rabbits are not apple-specific.
 Will I get a deep taproot
The root system is genetically conditioned and does not really depend on growth condition.
That is one of the reasons why most apple rootstocks are vegetatively propagated.
By the way, why are your seedlings diicotyledon? True rebel apple seedling are tricotyledon! :)
(Or rather, were rebel. Now they are Cox's Orange Pippin.)
Anyone familiar with growing peppers know how long it takes to go from a seedling to the first set of true leaves? I have a handful of Sugar Rush Stripey pepper seedlings that sprouted 3 weeks ago and they still only have their original 2 leaves, no true leaves yet. This is my first time growing from seeds and I figured they would have produced true leaves by now.
Yeah they should have. I want to say it takes about 1-2 weeks. Provide some details about how you’re starting them
have bunch of seeds and not enough pots and dirt to plant them all at the same time.
So have to figure out some weird optimal rotation aligning with temperatures to get bunch of stuff started, hardened off a bit and planted outside then have other over wave of stuff replace them in multiple cycles.
damn, suddenly it got so complicated.
Can somebody give me a quick rundown on using wood ash as fertilizer?
Is it cold in your area? They're particularly slow to start without consistently warm temps or a heating pad
less is moar
willl raise soil pH
its K
Newfag here, zone 9a, just got a small plot tilled yesterday
Any recommendations for what to plant at this time? Is it too late for this growing season?
all that bare soil
what a sin
Should I weave the tomatoes in and out of the wire or grow it up one side, tying it on to the wire?
Thanks for looking
What do you want to plant, anon? Tilled soil is perfect for "weeds" so you should get something desirable in the ground asap
Allotment is at the bottom of a hill
Back half is slightly sunken
Whole thing is clayey soil because we're in a valley in southern England
 Previous owner dug big fuck off trenches for potatoes then never did anything with them
 Half the plot floods any time in rains, rendering it useless
 When it's not raining it's like the Somme and we can barely walk on it without sinking into it
What the best way of dealing with this? Do we dig a drainage ditch? Level the soil and hope it helps? I've had a few people suggest planting potatoes there just to break up the soil but I'm unsure.
Tie to wire. I wouldn’t ever weave a plant through anything.
The weave method of tomato trellising refers to weaving string through a line of tomatoes. so you have stakes on either end of a line of tomatoes and as the tomatoes grow you should weave string through the tomatoes at increasing heights and anchor the string to the stakes.
Yeah you may need to dig drainage canals to divert the water. Soil can be broken up by daikon radishes. Or, if it’s allowed, just build up on top of the soil like a lasagna garden
more sunflowers popping
and corn
Thanks for that.
I only grew them up vertical strings before.
9a May - best is sweet potato and melons
Can baby tomato, egg plant, and peppers if purchase transplants
Non continental cuisine alternatives you can try:
Seminole pumpkin, Japanese eggplant, Louffa, Swiss chard, Mexican cucumber, Egyptian spinach. 
The idea is stuff from hotter climates than the US
Got 10 acres to work with, time hopefully won't be an issue but sometimes things happen. 
I'm hoping someone will be able to climb these someday, but I might try buying saplings next year.
These are "wild" seeds mostly from pink lady and cosmic crisp, but I understand they won't grow true to seed and may not produce the best fruit without grafting.
I hadn't heard of rebel apples or orange pippins before.
what's your light setup?
dont they have big taproots? why not just sow them outside?
too cold. yes very big roots, doesn't matter with soil blocks.
https://youtu.be/PaR3E8BcXbo?t=617 [Embed]
SSM says to give them a good amount of water
still have to plant 
4 pumpkin seeds
9 cucumber seeds
80 sunflower seeds
87 corn seeds
110 marigold seeds
133 onion seeds
1100 night scented stock seeds
Now... Sowing everything in trays before translating them outside is sensible except the stock seeds. How am I supposed to in a sane manner, plant 1100 seeds? Just scattering them into a tilled soil probably will yield low results, on the other hand manually doing them is too high of a number too.
same
rebel apple [seedlings]
I meant seedlings that have gone astray and produced three first leaves instead of two as they are supposed to ;-) (See pic for another example.)
According to biologists a plant is either monocotyledon (literally: having one first leaf) or dicotyledon (literally: having two first leaves).
Some individuals just choose their own third path in this world of the two alternatives.
Cox's Orange is a flagship UK variety, and is quite common all over Europe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_Orange_Pippin
I just like its taste, and my old tree is slowly dying (attacked by some bacterial canker on the trunk), so I copied it. The new ones prepare to bloom this year.
IT KEEPS FUCKING RAINING ALL FUCKING DAY EVERY FUCKING DAY AAAAAAAAAAAA
It's free germination and not need to water :^)
What herbs actually have proven and verifiable health benefits?
Would you settle for "proven and verifiable physical and psychological effects" from various compounds? Too much of any medicine is just poison. The short answer is that most herbs used before big pharma have compounds that do what they say.
Let food be thy medicine.
Plant some seeds dude. Use the weather to your advantage
Also the recipes and tidbits are banging. Say what you will about the man, he's an excellent ethnobotanist and corksniffing boozehound.
Never really been a lawn/garden type of guy but wanting to try my hand first time with maybe a jalapeno plant. Should I just go get a small plant from like Home Depot and plant it in a 5 gallon bucket?
send some here, it hasnt rained here in 2 months due to fukken geoengineering and i ran out of rain water long ago, pit water is fukken hard like 8-9 pH
doesn't matter with soil blocks
elaborate
Already dumped a whole pouch of wildflower mix on a shitty part of the lawn, I'd rather they wouldn't all float away and my shitty dirt floor basement would stop taking in water now tbqh
air pruning. big ol corn tap root turns into many many tap roots after a while just waiting to explode out of the block once planted. Then it turns into a nice plant and I only have to worry about the deer stealing the corn. 
Same for the sunflowers, beans, peas etc etc etc
forgot, the sunflowers are in the back of the pic
Interesting. I always thought that tap roots were different from regular roots and that interfering with them was a big no-no.
I've been busy these last few days, so I've been putting off transplanting my tomato seedling. I put it outside so it could get full sunlight instead of just being in front of a window. We had some nasty wind laat night and today, and I woke up to it knocked over laying on the ground. I didn't notice anything then, but this afternoon when I went to check on it it looked like this. The white spots and the curled up leaves concern me. Did it get too much sun? Did the contact with the ground make it catch something? Can I fix it?
looks like they werent hardened off and got shocked
Is it fucked or can I fix it?
don't even waste your time and resources on these bro. you will waste years of your life and hundreds of dollars on nothing. there's a strong possibility that the fruit will not even be edible. If you want to get into making your own cultivars, try plants that don't take years to fruit.
It looks like it's only been cold shocked so I'm guessing you were lucky and it didn't freeze that night when you left them outside. Tomatoes are resilient so they'll most likely recover. Look up how the harden off plants. It takes about 7-14 days so don't leave them outside over night until then and don't let them get battered by the wind and scorched by the sun in the meantime.
never had any issues with anything in soil blocks. I haven't tried radish but they can germinate at 45f anyway.
Literally me
I've had mine under a 100W lamp for 16hrs a day, alas, no joy. A couple have withered
Are my turnips fucked? They grow big leaves but almost no root.
I'm no expert but that sounds like too much N and not enough PK

Some of you peppers are not going to make it, but it's a loss I'm willing to take.
Maybe, I'll need to check on that, I'll take a more recent pic but thanks for the advice.

I will add

Didn't expect so many great responses, appreciate that guys
I was mostly just shitposting because I started dabbling into companion plantings, rotations, and stuff like that, but I do need a couple more seasons of basic stuff first
Reminder to put strawberry plants you don't want in your compost bin.
I was in college during the early days of Minecraft. I will be the first to admit that I was a dumbass as a college undergraduate. I played Minecraft for hours on end. Over time it slowly dawned on me that all this time shaping computer worlds could be used shaping the real world. When I left college I made sure I had a lawn and began gardening with one square raised bed. I found that doing actual work in the world is actually much more rewarding than Minecraft. I’m on my third property, second I’ve owned now, and with each one my skills have grown. Now I have a massive garden, chickens, a woodworking shop, and more. 
Minecraft was my gateway drug out of being a fatass gaymer into being a real man. I appreciate all y’all in this thread.
Minecraft had a big influence on me as well, it for sure is my most played game. I guess if you're the type that enjoys creating something then gardening is a very rewarding hobby.

I'm in Stanislaus County, California, so there's not much that we cannot grow here this time of the year besides Brassica. Still, I feel like there is something easy to grow that I am completely missing here. Is there anything that I can add to this menagerie? Something weird, or out there, or uncommon, or the like. 
Anyone have luck with exotic or weird crops that can be grown in a normal garden?
Not just me thats stuck with cotlydons eh
Epic gardening is OKAY. His advice is solid but I fuckin hate the clickbaity content and thumbnails.
https://www.rareseeds.com/basil-lettuce-leaf is pretty fun if you like basil.
I dunno, they hardly get any sunlight and the one that is older, you can see it's grown more leaves, so my guess is they will all get there with time.
what did you do to your starting soil there anon??? it looks really bad, but maybe it's just the lighting. If you're having trouble with your seedlings, you need to put them under an overhead grow light.
do you have the free seed catalog pdf ?
what did you do to your starting soil there anon?
compacted clay soil thats somewhat dry
 If you're having trouble with your seedlings, you need to put them under an overhead grow light.
No growlights, only minimal light and sun from windows.
Anyway I don't really care about the peppers, the seeds a from a bell peper I ate and I don't really have a climate to grow them. So if they live they live and get a chance, if they die, they die.
It's mostly a test to see germination rates, how they handle soil conditions and so on.
All my more important seeds get a slightly better soil conditions.
I do not. Sorry.
thank you for this anon. exactly what I was looking for although I'm just gonna get my mom to grow it because she's the basil whisperer. Any other suggestions I can add to the cart? 
I see. Well now you know that most tomatoes and peppers are at pretty close to 100% germination rate. You could probably leave a bell pepper in the fridge for a month, eat the whole thing, then shit on the ground and they would all germinate. Probably the easiest to start out of them all.
How much light do pepper plants need? Thinking of putting them inside my grow tent on cloudy days, i'm thinking 12 hours should be plenty?
The last month and a half I start running my lights for 16 hours. 
I would imagine on cloudy days anything would be fine. We've had ours in the window the last two days due to high winds and heavy rain and they are doing fine.
I see. Well now you know that most tomatoes and peppers are at pretty close to 100% germination rate. 
Sure but I'm also testing different soil conditions and what survives in them.
I also often take seeds, nuts, whatever I find and test if it's still germination viable, how does it handle different soils, whats the growth rate, temperature tolerance, moisture, such as flooding or too dry and seeing how plants grow and survive.
People will look at me grow stuff with no growth laps or dead in the winter and tell me its "too early". The fools... If they only knew my end game!
The last month and a half I start running my lights for 16 hours.
So more light during fruiting, good to know
Probably gonna put them behind the window on good days and in the tent on bad days. Could put them on the balcony, but that requires hardening them off, no?
I have crazy strong winds up here sometimes too.
KEK those peppers on the right
tomatobros we eating good
Garden rototilled, planting some stuff tomorrow. But first I need to strip off the old deck sealer before it gets too hot out. City is having the annual compost giveaway at the end of next week so I need to clear out some of my container soil tubs.
Any other suggestions I can add to the cart?
Anything that seems novel, if you're looking to fill space. If you have any specific theme or goal in mind, then I could offer suggestions. Just be wary because a lot of what they offer is generic and is available cheaper elsewhere. Though that's a matter of a few bucks and throwing the dice.
For fruiting I'm not sure. I think I remember a bulb change may be needed as warmer light helps with fruiting. 
On the balcony would require them to be hardened off. Depends on how many you have and how large they are. We usually harden off quickly but putting our plants under a table so they get morning sun, no direct overhead sun and evening sun. We move them a little further out each day so they get more intense sun until the leaves no longer start to get soft and bend a little. 
these have been inside for three days now, weather is so shitty and cold no reason to stress them with high 30s and mid 40s with no sun during the day.
grow grow grow
Trying to get things going, but the sun refuses to shine.
Cant wait, another three weeks and get some the beans and cucurbits in
already lost one tomato plant to snails or slugs
it's fucking over
sow moar, theres still time
I had an odd phenomena happen last year. Normally, slugs and snails go after my strawberries. I decided to plant violas in with my strawberries just to fill up the area. The slugs and snails ignored by strawberries and went after the violas, which grew so aggressively it wasn't even an issue.
Alright so since my mom already killed the lawn years ago I'm gonna start my veggies in the side of her house. What's the best approach here without me needing to spend a metric fuckton on soil? Boxes on top filled with soil? Dig it all up and place new shit? Use what's there and add fert? I'm a little lost on what I need to start figuring out here
I mean if you are planting that many isn't it time to be looking at some farm equipment friend?
Double digging is a gardening technique used to increase soil drainage and aeration. It involves the loosening of two layers of soil, and the addition of organic matter.
I'd say look into that, i grow in pots so i don't know too much about fucked up soil
Potatoes planted near the compost, 5 rows of carrots and 4 rows of onions at the far end, then garlic over by the trellis. I bought a seed dispenser so I used fewer packets of carrots than usual, I always plant them far too thick and can't be bothered thinning them.
Carrots tucked in for 2 weeks to germinate. I even gave them a headboard.
First is making sure mommy doesn't till the devil's acre. Put the fear into her to the point she calls asking if she can water it.
You kidding?
Thats just some of the seeds and stuff I have to still plant.
May I remind you I planted 20kg of seed potatoes, 500g of peas and chickpeas. 
And many other stuff like carrots, cabbages, beets, radish, strawberry and other stuff.
Only equipment is a shovel and a rake.
Got vetch?
I wish
May I remind you I planted 20kg of seed potatoes, 500g of peas and chickpeas
so...
got hairy vetch?
Giving you a (You)
That's a really nice haiku
Fuck me in the ass
I'v read some online source say you can plant potatoes 2-4 weeks before your last frost date, while other say the soil temp should at least be 8C.
How can both of those be correct, if the ground is freezing surely it's not 8C in there?
For what it's worth I planted my sunchokes well before our last frost date. I think it even snowed a bit but the ground absolutely froze because I remember the soil expanded out of the pot a bit.
plants struggling due to a lack of sun

Why did this general come to /out/ and not /diy/
What's the lore?
Gonna plant some stuff for the very first time since I was a kid but I'm afraid my autism is getting the better of me. I read that you need pollinators around so plants can grow more fruit? I don't actually have any flowers in my backyard at the moment, what kind of flowers do bees like? Sunflowers? I've also read that lots of modern flowers are bred to be pollenless?
Bees tend to like plants that put out clusters of flowers because they're a bit autistic and like to stick with a single type of plant when gathering pollen.
Social bees aren't the only pollinators, though. Flies pollinate. Wasps pollinate. Male mosquitos pollinate. If you have things going to flower, chances are something will check it out and pollinate it. Unless it's a weird case like with figs where they have like one species of wasp they live in a bizarre symbiosis with.
they're a bit autistic and like to stick with a single type of plant when gathering pollen.
Thats because it's useful when you are pollinating to polinate the same species rather than mix completely different plants pollen and get apple polen mixed on tomatoes for example.
How the fuck do I stop my mint from getting this black growth on it? Other leaves have little black dots on then
Bee totally wrecked my pear plant on the balcony. All the flowers are raped.
On another note, lettuce is doing good, this pic is from a few days ago they're already larger than this now.
I've decided to build a bean trellis out of scrap wood I inherited from my grandpa. 
I'm using cut and pointed 2x4 as the stakes to ground it and 1x3s (2 sandwiched together for the bottom of the frame and mount for the stakes, singular ones for rest of outer frame) for the frame. I use wide head screws for assembly. I put extras every 5 inches and leave the top half inch or so of screw sticking out to run string inside the frame like picrel. I plan to put screw anchors on the mounting point of the fram to the base and stakes so that I can dissassemble them in winter.
2 questions. 
One, should I treat at least the stakes and bottom of the frame; if so what treatment would not contaminate the beans I intend to grow?
Two, is this design strong enough to withstand wind and whatnot? I imagine once loaded down with vines it will start to act almost like a sail in the right wind direction.
Is it too late for this growing season?
literally just begun
don't let your soil be bare for too long, plant shit and mulch walkways 
a little late for onions but you can still try spring onions
perfect time for any root vegetables
beans
peas (maybe)
corn
brussel sprouts
celery
any herb
squash
pumpkins

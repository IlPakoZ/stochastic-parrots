Homeless in T-minus 8 hours
Family gets back from vacation at which point I will no longer have a home. I've over stayed my welcome. I'm being put out on the streets. 
Any tips? 
get a job
No. I want to do /out/ stuff.
Go to the woods
Start playing Minecraft
Don’t stop
Have you considered working for the forestry dept or Nat. Parks?

It’s a paradox. To be able to comfortably live as a bum requires the ability to plan. People who have the ability to plan don’t generally end up as bums.
Homelessness isn't /out/ related. Kill yourself.
Alright, since it’s spring already you won’t have such a bad time of it and can even get introduced early. Essentially 
No address, no work
If you don’t have an address you can’t find a job. Outside of some private holding willing to pay you dollars tax free (the IRS will be watching your ass even if you’re homeless) or just the kindness of strangers or pure luck, money is gonna be hard to come by. Use your old address if you absolutely have to or the address of a hostel and say that you’re ‘in transit’ as you’re between jobs. Or just fuck that off.. but if you’re a rural boy and you wanna go the woods way you might wanna switch things up to /x/. The woods are older than most civilizations, don’t forget that.. 
Second.. Night is cold.. like FREEZING. Trying to sleep at night? Good fucking luck. Bring gloves, a hat, decent sleeping bag and somewhere DRY. Being wet is bad enough if you got a place to dry off, if you’ve got no roof it’s a damn nightmare. Waterproof sleeping bag/tent. Watch for mud. Make sure you have a rucksack, and remember, as a homeless you’re bottom of the social ladder near drug addicts and thus any budding psychopath will not bat an eyelid over depriving you of anything valuable whilst you’re not around to defend it. Hell, even cops.. no ESPECIALLY cops. That’s another thing.. don’t trust em! Unless you’re a rich pedophile they don’t care about (You) on a personal level, and won’t bat an eyelid over making your life harder than it need be. Pick your spots carefully, harness your inner instincts, and learn to trust your gut. I wish you well. Bring lots of layers for when you get cold.. gloves, hat, scarf even.. whatever is needed
Well, get a job to support your out “stuff”
Sounds like you’ve burnt your bridges and are getting exactly what you deserve.
Got asked to leave my place after not being able to afford rent, while paying off hospital bills. I've been roughing it for the past 3 weeks. The first few days will fucking blow until you find your rhythm, then you'll never feel more free in your life after that. Find a spot of woods near civilization, get a job with direct deposit and save save save for a room to rent somewhere. My cheap ass tent, wool blanket and insulated snowboard pants are what I use to stay warm. Anything below 40° at night will feel like hell at first, but you get used to it. God speed to you, bud. Also, get a power bank for your phone, it's saved my ass many a time already.
do americans really
Work a night shift in a warehouse. This way you always evade the cold nights. Youre much safer outside during day time, too. Also everything will be open so you can use stuff and maybe larp as a normie.
Going homeless was a blessing for me instead of a curse. Not a responsibility in the entire world and am free to go on what ever adventures I want.
As far as tips go, get a hammock and tarp instead of a tent. Pick up hobbies to kill time. >>2569940

Similar situation and agree 100%. I don't even want to save up for a place to live. Just gonna travel around for a couple years. Live with the hippies in the woods.
Fuck being tied down, and wage slavery and not being able to afford shit anyway. I'm gonna go have fun
want want want
i'm glad your family's kicking you out, you sound like a leech. 
Get a job, faggot. Work for what you want.
how are you posting then faggot
sage
Real talk
Fake bs
You guys are both literal retards.
real talk
Opinion discarded
wagie wagie in your cagie
all day long you sweat and ragie
neet is comfy
neet is cool
neet is free from work and school
wagie trapped and wagie dies
neet eats tendies, sauce and fries
seriously asking, how do neets survive?
i mean obviously some unfortunate soul is paying the way for these overgrown children, but what if they just kind of.. stopped taking care of them?
would they starve?
Ironically if your family loved you and valued you enough to let you stay, you would have long ago developed the self confidence and drive to go out and thrive on your own. Instead, they have installed in you a self worth not capable of holding you up in this world. 
They do not deserve to simply be rid of you.
Most of the "I'm gonna run away to the woods" threads are neets who've been given an ultimatum about making some slight improvement to themselves or just making symbolic contributions to the household.
an actual census and study of the issue from that angle would be interesting, but usually either the threat of being thrown out motivates enough to get a crap part time job or they are actually able to get tard gibs, but a fair number will end up on the street giving blowbobos to crack heads and then the petty crime, mental health lockup, streetlife cycle till they freeze to death, OD, or get killed by a fellow transient.
OP wanna make $10 the hard way?

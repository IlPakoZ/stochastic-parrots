What does /out/ think of the Adirondacks? Born and raised here and Iâ€™ve always loved it here. 
I see a lot of shit about jersey fucks but if you know anything they are easy to avoid. Very proud of this pic btw :)
The adirondacks are a lost cause.
Good containment zone for the new york citidiots who make it past the catskills though
never heard of her
peak bagging lists have destroyed the whites, adirondacks, catskills
I said this in another thread and I'll say it here as well. If you can't find solitude in a 6 million acre park, that's your own fault.
you are a waste of oxygen
modern "mountaineers" are such an embarrassment
In NZ some swimming group inventing lake bagging and made a huge list of lakes to swim in, basically any alpine tarn is fair game and there are shit loads of them here. They even listed a pristine clear water lake that's illegal to swim in lmao.
To their credit, they usually don't call themselves mountaineers unless they do technical climbs, glaciated travel, or high-elevation treks over 6,000 meters. So less cringy than ultralight hikers calling themselves "outdoorsmen" like one did in another thread. Outdoorsmen can hunt, fish, and gather their own food instead of relying on unhealthy goyslop for sustanance.
Yes.
u'll shoot your weewee off
yes, imagine the shame they feel under the scrutiny of random internet autists for not dedicating their lives to technical moutaineering.

yeah. Am peak bagger, would never call peak bagging mountaineering unless I've got an ice axe, crampons for snow and ice or I'm tied in for rock. honestly I do it because I've got limited time in NY and doing the 3500 gives me an easy way to see the whole Catskills. Its the same feeling of wanting to be alone as it is to want to be on top of high places. I think the Catskills are different than the Addys because about 1/3 of the Catskill 3500 don't have a trail, yeah some have really obvious herd paths (Vly straight up has blazes) but some of those peaks (Rocky and Lone) it feels like mother nature is trying to throw everything out at you. Peak bagging is great in the fact that it creates a containment zone, so if you want to go do solitude stuff, you won't deal with the crowds. Vermont is really bad about this stuff, they stuff all their tall peaks except for Camel's Hump with ski slopes.
Addys are pretty cool, only place other than the Whites you can really feel like the vistas and height out West while still out east. It's the closest mountain range to Scotland in the US, and the canoeing and climbing are cool as well.
It's honestly kind of crazy how many people make the whole trip out to a place like that only to never go more than mile or two from the parking lot
i was all alone on the trap dike. glad you weren't there.
Is it still that bad out east? I noticed the trails in my (western) state got way more crowded during Covid but the numbers have gradually been going down again. Even the national parks aren't getting the same numbers they did a couple years back.
Last year was much less crowded than the years before it, even with more Canadians coming back across the border. The crowds peaked in September 2020 when the "busiest day in the history of the Adirondacks" happened

Depends on the time of year. Summer and midfall can be horrendous but if the peak is NOT the tallest or special one in the range (Mount Marcy is 8 up and 8 down) most normies won't do any other mountains that are more than 10 mile round trips. Washington is ridiculous in the fall because they keep building stuff on top, you can drive, take a train up, and buy lunch up there. The rest of the presidentials aren't so bad, just really frustrating when you are gassed because you just climbed 7200ft net after slogging through the ankle busting talis for the last 10 miles and you see these old folks with the summit with you. Good that they can enjoy the view but Addys with the exception of Whiteface Mountain are more difficult to access. Thats one thing that is really nice about the Catskills, the 3500 challenge avoids almost all the normie hikes (Kaaterskill Falls, etc.) with the exception of Panther, Slide, and Hunter mountain. I've never done the Catskills in the summer but in the Winter/Spring I'll usually only see 3 people on the trail on average.
my motivation to work out is directly correlated with my desire to do more peaks in a day and get to the harder places to avoid the glampers and normies. just seems so wasteful to drive all that time to do so little.
Anon, that article has a publication date of 2019...
Good hiking / kayaking but the views from the tops of mountains are few and far between outside the high peaks region. It's vast which is a plus, still I'll take the White Mountains or even the Green Mountains over them any day due to the vibes of the tourists.
I heard it's a $200 fine if the rangers catch you without wearing snowshoes
Only in the High Peaks Containment Zone if there's 8 inches or more on the ground

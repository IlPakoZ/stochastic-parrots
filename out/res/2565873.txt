Name a better hiking /out/fit
Naked and afraid
That’s pretty good but I wear pants because the catclaw acacia and manzanita will tear you up if your breaking through the bush.
where people wear it
shorts are only acceptable if you are Rhondesian. Otherwise you gay.
what are some good hiking pants to buy? i don't want ticks and i'm not paying 70 fucking dollars for a pair of pants from eddie bauer or columbia.
grow some leg hair
polycotton canvas pants. You're a smart boi. Use the internet to find some.
How does that help
you think carhart are too rugged/ not breathable enough for hiking? they seem to be the only thing reasonbly priced
Kühl is popular but expensive. There are other brands, but with a name, typically comes a price with it. I’ve worn a lot different stuff and what really matters is the fitting and if it’s durable enough for your use.
Haha baited

65/35 poly cotton blend, less than $5 each. Downsides are that fabric blend is a bitch to dye (though keeping them white would make spotting ticks that much easier), they're neither very breathable nor do they retain heat in the cold, and the angles on the pockets make it difficult to remove items while sitting (e.g. while driving).
No I have loads of leg hair, I'm just interested in how it prevents them
I wore a pair of Carharrt Utility Work Pants over the summer while doing field work in on the high plains and mesas out west. They were sturdy and I didn't find the heat oppressive. I'm from Florida though, humidity would probably make them less pleasant. Still, I wear them when it's sub-70F here, preferably sub-60F. Actually wearing them right now, they're comfy.
I should add, these are the 12oz duck canvas ones, so they're pretty thick. They make lighter ones too.
I don't get hiking pants.
I have two pairs of h&amp;m soccer pants in plain black that i have owned for more than 10 years by now.
They probably cost like 20e each.
Or i wear the boring slim fit Dickies work pants that i usually wear in my non hiking life.
same but zero drop trail runners is my preference
Not OP interested in your hairy legs, but in my experience wearing shorts I can feel the buggers crawling up thru my leg hair.
That said, apply permethrin to your /out/ clothing and bedding every three months. The stuff breaks down over time.
Clothing, like other gear, is an investment. You're gonna have to go in-store and try stuff on until you find what you're looking for. For me, I bought a pair of Columbia convertible pants and matching shirt from Big5 during a sale. That was 5 years ago and I'm about to replace the shirt since it ripped last year. Big5 sells a chink brand called Pacific Trails and they have decent stuff for out

You can get the pants and matching shirt for 56 bucks. I'd suggest to try it on first before making any purchase. Good luck brother.

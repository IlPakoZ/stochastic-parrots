forgor pressure was a thing
ears start feeling a lil funny
few hours later
I've gone half deaf and can barely hear anything
I get dizzy alot faster
food was good tho
10/10 would do it again
this easter vacation was the first time in my life ive ever been sick on an airplane, normally i fall asleep as soon as i click that belt, this time? no, non stop puking and nausea for 2 hours
and then your plane wrecked and you had to survive a month outdoors?

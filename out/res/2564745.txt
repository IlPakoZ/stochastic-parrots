I injured myself and can't hike for a couple months, so I bought a kayak as a way to get /out/ that doesn't require walking much. 
Anyone else have a cheap kayak like this?
I bought that inflatable kayak for &lt; $100 a few years ago. It's decent for the price. It's compact, inflates quickly, and is good enough for casual flat water outings. 
My biggest piece of advice would be to get a better paddle right away because the ones that come with it are utter garbage. A sturdier storage bag for the kayak and a quality dry bag were the other accessories I purchased right away.
I hope your injury doesn´t prevent you from swimming, anon?
Had it for 70€ a few years ago as well. It was fun, but you have to have good weather.
However, i loved it, so i spend a few thousand and got me a better folding Kayak, Nautik Argo for 2600€ with all the trimmings like deck, rudder and so on.
Nice, what river is that?
The river that flows out of your mother after half of /out/ has trampolined her.
kek
First is the river Ruhr, second the Rhine, last Ruhr again, in Germany, near Duisburg where i live.
the spot marks where i let my ship to sea, 200m from my garage.
I've considered a cheap inflatable but I think I'm better off with a rigid body yak on account of the gators and the oyster beds and such where I live
That map looks really similar to where I often go kayaking in Western New York, USA (Niagara River and Ellicott Creek)
Show pics then.
I have a two person Itiwit. It depends what you want to use it for. Inflatables are good because they fold up and are light to carry. They blow around on a windy day pretty bad and don't track all that well though. If you want to take them on flat water it doesn't really matter what you get. If you're looking for open water or a river with mild whitecaps (like class 1 or mayyyybe class 2 if you're experienced) then you're going to want to get one with tough rubberized bottom. You do NOT want to pop a tube in the middle of a river.
From outing with the same kayak the OP is looking at
Cheers, looks calm. Any ship traffic?
I've never encountered any while paddling... only motorboats.
Plenty here, but it's not a problem.
The Rhine can be fast, basically you can only go downstream, upstream i run out of steam after maybe 500m.
But the Ruhr, where i start, is slow most of the year:

Yes swimming is one thing I can do. The meniscus in my knee is torn so the main issues are stuff like walking downhill/stairs, running, etc. 
Yeah if I like it I will probably buy something better eventually. But this thing was really cheap and seemed like a good entry point. 
nice
It is. Just be aware of it's limitations and you will enjoy it.
I have k2 (same thing, just two person) held up pretty well the past 3 seasons.
Also have a 15’ canoe that never gets used since it’s a beast to transport 
Fishing from a kayak on the lake is pure bliss (until some cunt with a loud boat anchors 50 yards away and starts blasting their music)
That is exactly why i bought a folding kayak. It costs more, but i can just pack it up and take a train to any lake or river and get going.
There are no inconsiderate people here that do that, because we are Europeans.
:( yeah I don’t get it. 
The consolation prize is that’s 5 minutes from my house.
Before you upgrade to a regular kayak, you could rent one for a few hours and see how it compares to an inflatable one. Like >>2564978 said, inflatables don't give you quite the same experience.
I praise the lord, as a new kayaker was born today.
PRAISE THE LORD PEOPLE!
great pics anon
Cheers, glad you enjoyed them :-)
Because most obnoxious people are to poor to own boats in europe or its to big of a inconvenience. On trails I still meet people blasting thier stupid spakers
Good. The system works.
My neighbor has one-he goes out on the lake and has fun
wear life jacket
I've had that same model for more than a year now, it's definitely worth the price and I got a lot of use out it. Only thing that sucks majorly is the pump, shit broke after the second outing, it still works but the cheap plastic threading causes it to keep falling apart and I have to screw it back together. Also the paddle sucks as someone else pointed out
Intex Masterrace reporting in.
Spring is here, the sea is calling.
How do you get back then?
Hey anon, I once tried some water activities after a leg injury. I have a major piece of advice.
For the love of all that is holy get AND WEAR a life jacket. If your knee is as fucked up as my thigh was, and you fall in the water you will find you have little or no power in your leg if you are dumped into the water. Also, it will really hurt to kick hard. This is bad news even in 1.5-2m of water (where you could usually stand if you can get your legs under yourself).
Do not fuck around - looking cool is not worth drowning over.
t. Retard who had to get rescued in a 4 foot deep body of water.
I get out, fold my Kayak, and go to the next bus or train station. Sometimes i use a taxi.

Looking at picking up one of these
...overpopulation?
I would rather live in a large area, where even poor people have the space to store a boat, and where i can also find places they dont go (most of the places).
I would rather that than live in a crowded eurostate where im forced to cope with the local populace and cant just avoid them.
friend bought inflatable kayak because he wanted to be part of our summertime water adventures but it did not end up so good and he ended up selling it after one summer
inflatable could not keep up with our canoes and basically every trip was just us rowing extra slowly while he gave it his all all the time, it was not fun for anyone
basically at the end of the summer he was looking for electric motors and at that point he could just have gotten a real kayak for the price so he sold the thing
i feel bad for him
i think i'll stick to my Navarro 110. i can totally see me losing that one necessary lego piece first time lakeside.
I don't think that was on the market when i bought mine. I also wanted mine to be sea worthy with proper skeg, neoprene sock, steering system and so on, for some tours in the north sea and east sea.
But for very calm water yours will do, even in choppy water inland.
Yes, assembling it is a bit of a chore, takes me 20 minutes.
What?
The sea sock is hung into the cockpit and prevents water and dirt from getting inside the boat.
Oh i just have this
Not a sea kajak, so you don't need it.
If you are between Denmark and Stralsund, you really don't want to have water enter the boat.
But the sock is the second line of defense, this one is the first, most have seen something like it.
Not sure what it's called in english, cagdeck or spray cover? Here it's a Spritzschutzdecke.
Anyway, none of this matters if you are a sweet/calm water captain.
I take my yak out on the great lakes, i need it...
Well, you lucky bastard, getting sea conditions without the salt.
My aluminium frames corrode faster than a honest politician when the lobby money pours in.
I feel for you anon, i really do. They salt the roads here like theyre made out of pork. My poor outback (2nd gen) cries every time i put the snow tires on.
awesome!

a straightjacket.
:3
well the sepsis risk is higher from that Big Sasquatch Dick, but the HIV risk is lower than a rando Basketball American
Cover yourself in peanut butter and roll in chicken liver to make sure you look as retarded as you sound.
Whatever you would wear normally when /out/doors. All the other stuff would require knowing which cryptid you're intending to go after.
tin foil hat
A condom and a wedding ring
You'll need to wear alot of animal furs. As well a double sided dildo
Best way is to dress like a faggot.
So don't change a thing, and get out there OP.
Godspeed.
clothing doesnt matter, you need to have something to attract them though and its different for each one
I would carry the Holy Bible.
A tinfoil hat to protect against mind control.
Just regular out gear unless you have an idea of what youâ€™re dealing with. Maybe Carey some paranormal entity basics like the Bible, salt, holy water
Basic 10 C's, good side arm and a shotgun, long knife. You'd want steel, silver, enough salt to make a ring, a corked bottle, at least 13 coins, a Latin bible, crucifix, square hammer, holy water, lighter fluid, full sized shovel, a quail (or similar living vessel for transference) , and lastly a relic of a holy person (something as basic as the toe nails of a priest). 
Mind you, none of this will protect you if you go far enough out. I have a theory that we're all hive minded together and if you sever that connection for long enough your brain starts to search for a comparative signal. If you "pair" with a cryptid mind you'll be lost. You'll go feral. Most plebs just starve to death before that point, but if you live then you'll go around the curb.
And what about the attire? Would a regular hiking clothes work or should I be more prepared?
Come on now, anon. You know he won't do this.
You are going to be dealing with something from the sea of souls, normal rules don't apply. Usually the ritual implication of an object implies it's use with a neverborne or something tainted, for example a knife will carry more significance than a gun, since the knife has been used for a million years longer than a bullet hence more blood has been drawn by the blade than the gun. Time's arrow isn't as important in the sea of souls. 
But it doesn't matter/ why worry about something that is never going to happen. The moment you smell burnt sugar and rotting shit, the moment the bile rises in your throat and you see the impossible rolling from the shadows like rancid fat, you will void you bowels and go away inside, back to that seminal time when you were a newborn, whimpering for your mother, all thoughts of preparation and dynamic action forgotten.
We have never understood the others and we probably never will. We posses the same instincts as fauna to their presence: the sense of wrongness that stills even the cicada and the songbird. The only "solution" to the others is to destroy every jot and tittle of matter and man or beast that has been touched by them. Since the Pharaohs to the present this has been done. Kind, intelligent men have exhausted every option and resorted to this. 
Even if you succeed, or believe you have succeeded, you will be hounded to the ends of the earth, everyone you love will be placed in jeopardy. They will murder thousands to eliminate the possibility of a threat.
never go full retard

Yeah, an extra thick book would come in handy if you need something to bore him into submission. I guess...
A David Paulides "Missing 411" copy, firearm and some wood ash mixed with your gunpowder for your bullets.
If you really want to find one you can't have your phone or camera with you
Cryptids? These are one of these things you only see overweight people on youtube talk about?
Obese Americans that deepest dive into the woods isn't even getting on the sidewalk, but driving up to the 'haunted' theme park and using their drone for footage from the front seat of their car and then rereading reddit /r/nosleep spam.
I can smell the room that post has been written in from here.

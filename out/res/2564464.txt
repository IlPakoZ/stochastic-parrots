I'm fine paying fee's but it's a bullshit complicated process here. Reserve the exact backpacking spot, parking pass, campfire permit...
And there actually are rangers that stop and check people, they've all been cool with me and only checked once before
I'm so glad I don't live in the UK.
If you make any reservations or purchase a permit through rec.gov, you are paying Booz Allen to control you. Who is Booze Allen?
Who owns ReserveAmerica? What is Alpine Investors?
This is start to happen world wide brah
here in Brazil most wild places are being bought by retards that closes it so you can't even go to the forests in piece
Depends where you camp.. East coast campsites are ass expensive for a "spot" dunno if its to keep the niggers out because they have to pay.. but it's getting insane. tent only spot, nothing else- $30 is becoming the norm..... midwest it's still pretty cheap- for now... Then you have Bro-tier states like Nebraska that legit have firerings at their rest stops.... and have Bro-tier laws in place that protect you from using the rest stops to actually sleep- because its dangerous as fuck to drive tired but retarded ass states like my home state of florida... has too many people and basically ban you from doing this... TN before the new no camping on states lands. "anti homeless law" it was like 4 hours you could park at the rest stops.
Make it illegal to hunt and gather
Make it illegal to live outside a city
Make it illegal to pay with physical currency
Make it illegal to own a gas vehicle
Sit inside and consume digital goods, faggots.

Oy vey why are you asking so many questions
refuse to get permits
hike off trail to hard-to-reach places
enjoy your camp knowing that no underpaid ranger rick will have the motivation to track you down and fine you for your lack of a spork loicense
I mean, they're not cops but they are government employees, I feel like it's a big deal, it's not poaching a sturgeon but still... Probably a $200 fine
The forest is thick there no one will find you
Just some expended ammo
get back to the trailhead and find a boot on your car
Wonderful plan.
What miserable nanny state do you live in that they boot your car for parking, lol
pull battery-powered cutoff saw out of trunk
cut off boot, drive away, toss boot pieces in a trash can somewhere
camping permit
Jesus fucking Christ
Cartop tents are a meme. Incredibly expensive, hard to replace parts, require an expensive rack/bed rack, reduces gas mileage (and on a tacoma? lol) etc. I work in an outdoor store and they're always getting returned because they require more than one person to mount/dismount and are just a pain in the ass all around. 
I overland in my stock tacoma with my 2 person tent and a comfy sleeping pad. I have Ko2s for rocks/mud. Only thing I'm considering is a winch, but I've never gotten stuck because I know how to drive in the mud.
this happens here?
the only acceptable form of a cartop tent is when they are built into a van or a truck and allow access to it from inside. sleeping on top of your car sounds extremely annoying climbing up and down, just to save a few minutes of searching for a spot.
The only cartop tents users are people who are afraid that snakes will somehow get into a regular tent and eat them. This fact is directly from the mouth of a cartop tent maker who I've known for 20 years.
i could see them being useful in overlanding in desert environments due to rocky terrain and poisonous animals
Imagine only going out in the state in which you live.
It wouldn’t be a state law or regulation as you’d be in a national park, pretty much the only place that requires a permit. How do newfags not know that?
As another Anon said in a different thread, the US has permit systems (almost entirely limited to national parks) because we still have natural areas that are worth preserving. They saw where Europe went wrong and took a different course.
Not all of us have the luxury of driving cross country to have our cars booted, check your privilege
he missed the joke
What miserable nanny state do you live in that they boot your car for parking, lol
Just because you put “lol” at the end of a question doesn’t make it a joke. Please explain the humor behind it.
funny that the parts of europe worth saving has done the exact oposite and made it a constitutional right to travel and camp freely on non developed land.
lurk moar
NPS/BLM is also a method for controlling the population corridors and resources. It's not as altruistic as you might think.
This is something that really pissed me off about Alberta. They recently made all crown land west of Calgary subject to a camping pass now, $60/year. Crown land is supposed to be free for everyone, and it is in the rest of the country.
You're stealing food from the mouths of the jooz' larvae.

when it becomes a crime in my cunt i'll sell my expensive gear and use hardware store shit so it won't be a big financial loss when authorities book me
also they will leave you alone if you display mentally ill behavior and look like a filthy hobo
Ordinary citizens will.
Law enforcement will not.
They will arrest you and impound your vehicle.
Laws and regulations like that are put in place as a preventative cost
Regulates and deters morans from turning outdoors into a bigger shit show
Sucks for people who respect being out but without them tourists would be pitching tents on top of endangered species nests
don't carry any identification
refuse to give any
just say "The charges, officer?"
What can they do to you, really? Keep you in a cell for the rest of your life because they found you sleeping under a tree and you won't tell them your name? Not bloody likely.
There is no law that they will not kill you to enforce
really, faggot? you get all your legal knowledge from First Blood?
23 second response time
That's some fast salt right there
Oh no, gonna cry cause I'm better at 4chan than you?
It's a public health issue.
If you're sleeping outdoors, where are you shitting?
Regulates and deters morans from turning outdoors into a bigger shit show
Because everybody knows that criminals follow laws, retard.
I don´t get people like you. It´s unironically morons like you that got us all the government tyranny, and spying.
If you make laws for retards and criminals, you end up with a country run by retards and criminals.
Fucking smoothbrain, holy shit.
in my cunt
I just wish everybody who says "in my cunt" instead of "in my country" would drop dead.
Nothing of value lost.
gonna cry
You sound like the mean kid from an early 90s movie.
You are assblasted and I said deters not prevents
Also nowhere did I say I agree with it I just gave my opinion on why I think it is
You're right though we should have no laws so anyone can do absolutely whatever they want any place and time
no laws
Yes
yeah, in your cunt maybe
public health issue
yeah, they should be shitting in the streets of san francisco like everybody else.

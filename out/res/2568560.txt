Anyone working on any DIY projects? 
I just finished this meme half-pyramid tarp from some simple, free plans I found at a site called Switchback Gear. It’s barely tall enough to sit up in but long enough to sleep under. I’m 6’ 1”. Without doors and some kind of bug protection I couldn’t see using it anywhere but in the most pristine, insect-free area during a drought. 
Really I made it just to practice sewing. It came out ok. It’s only saggy in the pic because it’s super windy, the ground is really soft from two days of rain, and the dog on the right jumped on it. I told him to get in, and he thought I meant on. 
I need a better plan for grosgrain tie out loops. They looks sturdy but certainly not neat. Also one of the seams on a short side came out twisted and I don’t know why.
Twisted seem
lol you can get basically the same pitch with a flat tarp.
It’s not much different than making a flat tarp. It’s really just a trapezoidal shaped tarp.
Thanks for contributing to the thread.
Nice layout
Your doggos look like they love it.
Combine it with this from the same site. Even more sewing practice.

I’ll probably cut up this half-pyramid and use most of it to make a 9x7 with doors. A bug bivy is planned as well, though I’ll probably try to make a silpoly hammock tarp first (something I’ll actually use).
Anyone tried some bushcraft projects?
Any easy stuff to do?
Sounds like a good plan Anon. The half pyramid tarp plan always struck me as neat, but primarily for if you were planning on cowboy camping but wanted something 'just in case'? Are you making the hammock tarp with plans from somewhere? 
I haven't done much MYOG/DIY for going /out/. I was planning on starting small with this

But I've been having a hard time figuring out where I can get the materials in Canuckistan.
What kind of pack are you making?
Sometimes local fabric stores will have “utility nylon,” which is a pretty basic ripstop nylon, around 1.6oz. There’s also AliExpress, which has an ok selection. Things like buckles and nylon rubbing are pretty ubiquitous and any online or retail shop with sewing supplies will have them.
Just finished this yesterday. First time making a patch.

Supposed to be a wooden spear, but yeah, not the world's most accurate representation. 
Maybe I'll do better in the future.
Dope. Nice job anon.
Anyone working on any gardening DIY projects? Or would that be only in the general thread?
Nice bro I made this a few years back, accidentally gave it an ahegao face. I have few others I've made as well. All of you should at least make one or two hand embroidered patches it's cheap n fun, and nobody else will have that patch it's unique to you.
OP here. I planted a meyer lemon tree one weekend and a brown select satsuma the following weekend. I would have preferred an Owari satsuma but the garden center didn’t have any and it’s getting late in the season. 
The lemon tree went on the front lawn, replacing another that didn’t fare so well. It was hit by some pretty hard freezes, and admittedly the spot wasn’t ideal, as it was partially shaded from the evening sun by two large water oaks across the street. But both of those oaks have been removed, so I’m hoping for better results. The blood orange tree that also sits on the front lawn is doing much better already. 
The satsuma was planted were another satsuma stood for a few decades. The old tree was destroyed by Formosan termites, which I’m told only attack trees when the trees are too weak to defend themselves. It produced a lot of fruit until maybe 5 years ago, and the spot receives full sun.
Damn, nice work. Can't believe you even did the background.
Fairly far south, I assume?

I got a full-sized keg the other day and was thinking about things to make from it. Would it be just wasteful to make a composter?

Am trying to choose between a TT pathfinder mk2 or karrimor predator 80-130 as a multipurpose backpack. Will be my multipurpose backpack, but primarily for long hikes. Which is better for someone 6ft5?
Lol
Lmao
What do you mean by multipurpose? For a day pack +80L is kind of ridiculously big. 30-35L would be plenty for a day pack.
LOL
LMAOOOO
You mean long camps because you are not going to get far with that thing kek?
I mean multi-day hikes walking 25+ km each day and sleeping innawoods. Am currently using a large british army bergen for it, but it's not really for tall people, and I want something better ventilated.
Go for some ILBE/FILBE rucksack.
I use a milsurp rucksack copycat of the CFP-90 and it is moderate ventilated.
Something from Mistery Ranch or Eberlestock will be comfier, but at higher cost.
I don't think any of these will have better ventilation. Backpacks suck. You have to make your own pack, or have it made for you with a level of customization that fits you close enough.
You don't think they'll have better ventilation than my bergen? They both have a mesh.
Long hikes my ass with that heavy ass pack and all the larping bullshit you probably take along
He’s Australian, so his definition of a long hike is somewhat different from an Americans definition.
if they use gear I don't like they're larping
One in every thread
When I was a ZOGbot, we’d clear 25km with a pack similar to these in about 4-5 hours… about 80 lbs. of total gear weight per man, all told.
Especially taking all day to cover that distance instead of having to move with a purpose, it’s eminently doable for a healthy male in his 20s-30s. Not everyone is as weak as you are.
When i was a zogbot
When
So you dont do it anymore? Because even you know the difference between CAN and SHOULD.
Yeah, these “we did it in the army” posts are retarded. They carried 80lbs once every now and then because they were forced to as part of their job, everyone hated it, and several people eventually became crippled because of it.
Karrimor sf because All my packs are karrimor sf
Unless you actually need it to be fucking huge get the sabre with side pouches. It's the most versatile thing in the world especially if you get the harness for the side pouches. It's 4 different size packs in one lmao
Kifaru is really a no-brainer when you want to go for the military look without feeling fuck up after a long day.
this is the larpiest of larps
you need to be 18 or older to post here, fatty
anyone who isn't a scrawny UL twink is a total fatso
fatty spotted
It’s almost the opposite. The guys I see with retard tier 80L larpsacks are often fat, though not always, but most people with UL gear look like athletes (probably because they actually go outside).
I mean, is this real life? Look at those things!
im colonizing this thread bc i bought a milsurp pack that came without a hipbelt. saw some guy used a savotta replacement hipbelt but it costs as much as my bag and it would make no sense to spend so much money on what is essentially a cheap bagpack for masochist. would tactical molle belts work? something like the FILBE hipbelt but not as big im not obese.
I got the blackjack 80 for extended trips, I have been using it alot snowshoeing in Albertastan. They are worth it if they are in sale, usually around 350$ USD, but not worth full price (1K$USD)
It is big enough so you can overpack if needed, like if you shot an animal or something and we’re packing out meat, but it cinches down very nicely to become more low profile if you don’t have as much shit. It is the most comfortable pack I have ever owned, I have back problems and so far I have had essentially 0 pain using this pack. I usually pack under 30-35 pounds maximum, however I have packed many heavy loads with it and it works great. It’s not a lightweight Appalachian trail type bag, but that’s obviously not what you are looking for out of a mil type pack.
I left a review on optics planet if you want to read it
https://www.opticsplanet.com/mystery-ranch-blackjack-80-backpack.html
I agree with this guys statement, I used to be the fat guy with the big big but now I am no longer fat, I use smol bags for most things but big bags for hunting or very long/cold weather trips. 80L is my absolute maxinum
80L is my absolute maxinum
I think that's most peoples absolute maximum.
Also, for 420, you might as well buy a wisport reindeer.

Looks like a good pack but I am very content with my mystery ranch and since I have enough bags ranging from day bags, 3 day bags, 45L bags, 60L, and 80L I have no reason to buy another bag unless one is damaged beyond repair
I see. Any recommendations for a bug out bag between 45-60L? 2 weeks innawoods, possible snow/rain storms. I'd like something that will stand the test of time. All around reliability and high quality, over comfort and crazy bells and whistles. Thoughts?
He's like 5'5, very easy to build impressive looking muscles until he stands next to a normal height human being.
would a belt work as a belt
gee I wonder
plenty, they're all expensive and all twice as heavy as they need to be. Pick whichever one you think looks the coolest and edgiest and pretend to anons online that you bought it by posting a stock photo
Mil spec equipment
So anon im gonna let you in on the best kept secret that everyone who has been in the military knows.
Mil spec shit sucks. 
Mil spec shit is not designed to be comfortable or top of the line, or even good for that fucking matter, its designed to be 3 things.
1) Durable enough to get the governments monies worth
2) Cheap enough they can buy in bulk
3) Gets exactly the job done it was contracted to be done.
Mil spec shit is not comfortable, its not very versatile in some cases and in many times not even good. 
Save for a few outlyers like the military sleeping system is a pretty solid set of gear. 
You will be better off looking at civi products, which 9/10 times are way more comfortable, made using the same tech/designs as military shit, but with more features/comfort in mind.
Pick whichever one you think looks the coolest and edgiest and pretend to anons online that you bought it by posting a stock photo
fucking kek. Alright, wisport Raccoon Large it is.
Can you recommend the 60-100 sf for mountaneering purposes?
I want to get the 60-100l version of this, but am hesitating because of the DWR. What do?
for mountaneering purposes
definitely not.
safe for a old arcteryx bag or a stone glacier if you need to carry that much up on a peak.
There is not a single modern backpack that will stand the test of time as long as they keep using PU coated fabrics. People think that their packs last a life time because "bro its 1000 denier" when the sad reality is that the hydrolysis will break down the polyurethane way before the wear and tear eat through the actual nylon. There is nothing you can do about it. The pu coating will turn into sticky goo sooner or later and then your gear will stick to it and get all dirty.
It is a scam when you think about it. The pu coating does not even keep your gear dry because they do not seam seal all the stiching. Its just planned obsolescence.
That's why i got one of these babys
If I show you mine will you show me yours?
Retarded generalization and doesn't really apply on products that are not issued or bought in bulk by military.
he's right for usa milsurp, there's some real gems but a lot of it's shit and a lot of the old gem items everyone knows about like woobie blankets became collector items and aren't worth the cost to actually use as gear anymore.
europe milsurp's better. but its not a generalization to say milsurp gear will be below par and below the curve of what you can buy on the civvie market especially on the high end.
imagine believing that people who actually go outside &amp; aren't poor wouldn't want to have the best gear.
that's where their fantasy falls apart for me. everyone with hard proven miles either follows the ultralight philosophy, at most the boomers with their old rec gear will tell you "its not for me but its a really good idea"
that being said, ultralight is not for all outdoor activities and /out/ is a general outdoor board not just a hiking board. as superior as we are.
woobies
collector's item
a milsurp woobie in good condition costs about twice as much as a thin wool blanket of the same size, i.e., still less than $25. You just have to watch for the sales.
where do they go on sale? i want one to fuck around with in the summer.
I got a few for my kids from Sportsman's Guide back in December or January for $22 each. I do have a membership with them but the trial membership pays for itself on your first purchase.
Never buy milsurp on eBay because there you do pay collector prices. Go straight to the surplus merchant, brick and mortar of possible.
https://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/us-military-surplus-digital-camo-poncho-liner-used?a=2215004
Not the woodland camo ones I got but they should work for you.
acupat
It may be affordable, but at what terrible cost?
A $4 bottle of Rit DyeMore?
I personally don't trust sportsman's guide, most of the shit I've ordered from them comes in shit condition, or was backordered and I couldn't wit on it any longer.
I can't believe how expensive backpack cough cough tactical modular rucksack systems cough cough cost so much.
tfw all surplus going forward is going to be acu
Anon, you do know that acupat got retired, right?
Yes, which is why it's currently flooding the market. It was in use for 14 years. Also it's technically UCP, need to stop calling it ACU now.
Believe it or not there is more to "going outside" than "thru-hiking" mediterranean temperate well-maintained trails in summer.
Also if you were fit and accomplished you're not going to sacrifice comfort for a few pounds in summer when you are already used to hauling 50lbs cross country in autumn.
In fact the only reason I can think of is if the trails are so crowded and boring that you just want to blaze through them and necessarily approach hiking with a competitive sportive mindset.
UCP may be flooding the market, but it has to compete with OCP/Scorpion, which people will want more because it's current issue. The UCP gear will get bought up by nostalgic OIF masochists and landscapers, then probably shuffled into some warehouse to be forgotten.
multicam is cringe tho
Compared to UCP it was a godsend and don't you try denying it
I'm not denying it's better, but everyone who wears it looks like a fed. Give me flecktarn or M81 any day.
lmao do u have pics of you wearing it ? And how much does it weight ?
Believe it or not there is more to "going outside" than "thru-hiking" mediterranean temperate well-maintained trails in summer.
Also if you were fit and accomplished you're not going to sacrifice comfort for a few pounds in summer when you are already used to hauling 50lbs cross country in autumn.
yeah weird though that's not actually reflected by reality. everyone who actually spends any amount of time in the backcountry takes their gear and weight seriously. i doubt most of the clowns itt even do any math on the food they bring or read the labels.
Also if you were fit and accomplished you're not going to sacrifice comfort for a few pounds in summer when you are already used to hauling 50lbs cross country in autumn.
let's put that to the test, see if anon knows what he's talking about, or if he's just another victim of thinking the "survivalists" on youtube are surviving in more than their back yard...

OP said he’s going to use his 80L larpsack “primarily for long hikes.” So while out is a general purpose board, this is a backpacking thread.
https://andrewskurka.com/gear-lists-past-trips/
this is all before ultralight gear existed too. its almost as if caring about weight is a natural logical conclusion anyone who spends notable amount of time traveling would come to. you would think its pretty common sense the first time you walk up a mountain and realize how much each pound adds up. 
do you think marketing tropes and memes are why? those gear lists pre-date ultralight gear existing as more than someone's home brew creations from a forum. ultralight didn't exist. i know because i'm not a zoomer. 
i get the urge to resist whatever is popular, and you see shambling freaks with torn backpacks sleeping on thinlight foam and rubbing a shaved down toothbrush for warmth. you can care about weight without being that guy. its possible. 
b--but you're not strong enough
well actually i'm probably hiking like 3x what you do in a day, i used to do it before all the fancy new gear existed, and your joints and spinal compression has nothing to do with how strong you are. if you actually hike a lot and aren't a larper you'll probably start to understand ultralight by the time you're 30 why pretty much everyone around you who spends a lot of time hiking seems to care so much about weight.
doesn’t know the difference between comfort at camp and comfort while hiking
Please go back to /k/
imagine having to have a knee meniscus surgery or having to get vertebrae fused because you wanted to larp as armyman and got gatekept by getting a job and saving up for a summer for real gear lmbo just imagine it
should have lifted more!!!
Unlike you I spend months every year at the arctic circle, and I've never heard of Sturka, not do I care about youtube, reddit, surplus, tactical or bushcraft, and I've also never been to an REI or similar.
You are worrying about the wrong things, bro.
spends any amount of time in the backcountry
I doubt you ever spend a week off the trail when you look like darwin on the trail.
 takes their gear and weight seriously
You should take your bodyweight and gear very seriously indeed. In my out philosophy gear weight, as long as it is within your fitness levels to carry it for 20 miles a day is secondary to its function to enable you to enjoy going whereever you want to go in all weather conditions, and not being dependant on trails or huts and other tourist stuff.
90% of people are weekend warriors that do maybe one longer trip every year. It does not take that much planning and dialing in your gear to do that. Not saying that quality gear does not make your life easier but as long as your enjoy your time you are doing it right. Lightweight gear allows you to bring more non essentials with you. Thats is the most beneficial thing that that normies get out of ultralight gear.
Who knew? There's actually a based poster on /out/ in the post-covid era
pics
Not yet, I only rigged it a few nights ago when I needed a break from the computer. Doubt I'll get /out/ this weekend due to the holiday but I want to try it out ASAP. Will try to get pics for (You) but if I have one or more of my kids with me then I probably won't.
weight
I didn't weigh it, but for a test load I put in my sleeping bag, bivvy, mess kit, stove, a 1lb bottle of propane, and 5 days worth of Humanitarian Daily Rations. Plus the shit I keep in the vest's mag pouches and on the belt, like bug spray / canteen / poncho / first aid / snacks for the kids. Up and down my basement steps ten times while bearing that test load was no problem, but it's obviously not lightweight. For the intended purpose, a summer 2-nighter with my son, who might cover 6 miles all day and whose favorite TV show is MASH, it's perfect.
Are you saying he isn’t strong? Post physique, lol.
The dude cycled the CDT and has done two (2) R2R2R runs. His legs aren’t big just because he’s short, they’re big because he uses them.
If you can not carry 40-50 lbs for 20 miles a week with ease and without permanent damage you should invest in some trail runners and a gym membership instead of in the lastest gear. You're not there yet. You will with training, even if you are 5'5. Its not an olympic achievement.
Wait, he BIKED the entire CDT? What's this guy's name? I've seen his photos posted here but never got his name.
Jack Jones, aka Quadzilla. Biking the CDT is acktchually pretty common.
Post physique
50% of this board is manchildren fighting about who is a "real hiker" and who is not. Even Reddit is better at this point
The problem is that people do widely different activities, and generalize their experience, and basement larpers collecting shit while actually never going out.
Doesn't the CDT go up steep mountains (1k vert per mile or higher)? Do people just carry their bikes up those sections and ride them down?
at this point
When was Reddit not better than /out/?
fr nobody needs top tier gear when were talking abt overnighters and day hikes. And gear like that is cool, the gear itself is part of the fun
I like the vest thing too, if u put the denser stuff in it itll probably help balance the entire pack and in my experience, the center of gravity of the pack def matters when talking abt heavier loads
nobody wanna be bent over under the pack nor have to constantly fight against a backwards pull lol
As larp as it would be, I'd like the mystery ranch mountain ruck.
He may have meant the Great Divide Mountain Biking Route, which is totally doable and 100% cycleable.
the gear itself is part of the fun
yes.jpeg
The vest is an LBV-88, pic related. The pouches are nice, but those panels also trap heat. I may swap them for suspender straps. But the shoulder harness holds those sand-colored cargo straps in place (and also pads them), and they're what makes what makes the pack in >>2562968 comfortable. They go through the loops on the top and all the way around the back of the bag, underneath it and through the loops on its bottom, around the sides, through loops on the belt, and then buckle in up front. Makes for an easily adjustable suspension that carries the load comfortably. Otherwise it's one of the worst backpacks ever made.
for 20 miles a week 
16 miles a day is the average pace for thru hikers, that's an average including geriatrics who had hip replacements. 
and then also add in you probably live somewhere flat while i live in a mountain range. as is evident by "miles" being your metric.
i don't think you realize every ounce off my back is translated to a faster pace and more hours on trail. its zero sum. my hikes aren't easier than yours, they're probably a lot harder. people who carry less than you aren't weaker than you. they're probably doing more hardcore stuff than you were it starts to matter to think about those things.
16 miles a day is average after they’ve been hiking for a few weeks straight. People who do t hike regularly (most of /out/ lol) are averaging 10, 12 if they really push it. That’s what I saw from the MeetUp group I ran. 
I work out so I can go further
What have you done to toughen the bottoms of your feet? Is there a machine for that or is it free weights?
This. I walk barefoot on gravel, sandpaper and loose 1/4-20 bolts for at least three miles a day to toughen my feet. That way, when I put on my hiking shoes I don't get hurt by the memory foam insoles. I can go almost ten miles before I have to ask my wife to carry my gear now.
i pour the legos all over my carpet, i'm a big strong boy!!
Maybe I made that one too subtle
consider using rigid stays to keep the pouches from being in direct contact with ur torso. I can't remember the name but there's a brand that's specialized in backpacks with front pouches, they use one stay that flexes in an arc from the shoulder strap to the hipbelt. Allows a few cm for air to pass through
flecktarn
Das rite
he doesn't larp as The End or a German conscript behind enemy lines while /out/
Why even go?
That's not even surplus flecktarn though.
Not sure if you’re just being silly or being an asshole, but if you’re not actively using your feet via long hours spent on them, you’re going to end up with blisters on a long hike. The softness of your boots don’t really matter.
REEEE no not that flecktarn you need flecktarn for zogbots
No need to be upset
And nobody ever spent time on their feet at a gym
No one is building callouses from a gym routine. What even is this argument? Are you retarded? This is basic bitch hiking 101. You can have great fitness but baby feet. Seriously Anon, you should know this.
I just use a basic bitch condor backpack
Who is this vtuber and why is he all over this board?
I'll be gone soon. I'm just here to laugh at urbanites blog about outdoors gear until my /biz/ ban is gone
Any strong opinions on the Platatac SPUR about to pick one up in M81
The karrimor has better build quality and materials and also has a better carry system for load distribution.
Both can be adjusted for your size since you're withhin adjustment range.
I have a karrimor predator 80-130, I did a lot of research, it was the best fit for my requirements. I have some gripes:
- The lack of strap keepers, lots of excessive strap length flapping around all the time
- The lid being sewn to the pack instead of having straps on both sides for overloading the pack above nominal capacity while maintaining some sort of rain protection
- The hip belt isn't re-routed to be pulled from the sides, but centrally at the buckle. Hard to fix.
- Hip belt has central 2" plastic buckle failure point, i had one fail on a previous pack since them i'm weary of the issue (easy to replace tho)
It's still a really good pack I would recommend, especially the value for money is outstanding. It's a gigantic pack, it's quite cheap compared to the competition, yet the build quality and materials are excellent.
What you need to understand about this board is american backpack culture. American packs top out around 90-100L tops, Mystery Ranch, Eberlestock, Kifari ... none offer above 100L.
European packs, you can get 130L from TT, Karrimor, Berghaus, .... and Berggans or Norrøna will even sell you 160L.
The conclusion is obvious: Americans are weak sissies, they obviously can't carry big backpacks, and there is no market for them in the US.
That's why americans immediately get butthurt and question the need for such packs when they're even mentioned.
It's a coping mechanism to gloss over their inferiority.
It looks quite bad, obvious fake.
It's also silly since you can buy high quality Leo Köhler german made weather jackets with gore-tex membrane on the surplus market for about the same as that bad looking chink copy with obvious off-colors.
That's why people used to buy flecktarn in the first place, you could get a tough pair of pants for 5 bucks from the surplus store.
For a long time during the 70's, 80's and 90's every construction site in germany had some workers wearing flecktarn pants.
Now that's considered weird and instead people wear 50 bucks dark grey shitty polyester fabric "work wear" made in china where the seams come loose after 2-3 years, but it has a fancy logo and people consider it a fashion brand so popular they wear it as casual clothes too.
pig disgust.
Post body (you won't)
no one builds callouses at the gym
You can just say you've never exercised a day in your life
its fake! Off color! Chink made! You can buy cheaper
Keep coping
What is there to cope? You're the one who is gassing himself with copium over your garbage overpriced chink gear.
Running around the woods with cheap Bluetooth headphones and knock off flecktarn makes you a joke.

How come you didn't post the pattern? 
I mean you can see the pattern, but you wanted the tag.
Is it because IT LOOKS THE FUCKING SAME?
Not really. But like I said, I don't buy miltec and chinese knockoffs of things I could buy surplus, European made, so I can't say for sure as I don't have the patterns to compare. Regardless, older flecktarn looks different from modern felcktarn. I prefer the older versions.
jbl
skullcandy
Why would I wear either of these? And especially why the fuck would I wear headphones while out? That's just embarrassing.
Kek. Stay mad, chinktarn poser.
It's miltec from Deutschland, didn't order it from Amazon which is where the chink knock offs come from. It has a wool intererior that zips into the water/windproof shell. Fuck off now I don't care if the pattern isn't from nazi era
It's miltec from Deutschland,
How stupid are you? It's not made in Germany. MilTec is infamous for churning out knock off garbage. They have for years.
Are Hill People Gear packs actually worth it? They're all pretty expensive and require an additional hundred dollar belt to boot, is there that much of an advantage over other options?
There are better packs for the money. Framed backpacks are easier on your back. The commericial stuff from REI is for UL fags or people who want to ruin their backs.
eberlestock destroyer69 i also have the frontloading 30 liter model called the little brother that i cannot recommend enough
What you need to understand about this board is american backpack culture. American packs top out around 90-100L tops, Mystery Ranch, Eberlestock, Kifari ... none offer above 100L.
European packs, you can get 130L from TT, Karrimor, Berghaus, .... and Berggans or Norrøna will even sell you 160L.
Why is this? "Americans are sissies" is not a real answer, not that it's not true but no one on any continent carries more shit than they have to. What are Europeans doing with those dozens of extra liters?
What are Europeans doing with those dozens of extra liters?
Portaging? Portage packs come in those sizes (even in America) because you want to move all your shit in one shot rather than making multiple trips back and forth, and because the pack spends most of its time in the bottom of your canoe and only a little time on your back.
Portaging
Usually heard of this as being more of an American thing desu
Makes sense, canoes are from here after all. But they're probably doing something similar with those huge packs in Europe - not portaging necessarily, but using them as luggage that they carry on their backs for short journeys between transit nodes.
Fine whatever I'll take your word for it. Name a brand (outside of milsurp gear) that isn't mass produced in China then

I have no idea what your budget is or even what gear or conditions you're talking about. Given your cheap headphones I'd say you probably wouldn't like the price of cottage manufacturers so it's not worth doing research for you. Use whatever you want, but I'll never be caught in chink made knock offs of German made gear.
name a brand
"uhhh it isn't worth it, ur headphones suck"
Every time
NTA but Tough Traveler packs are made in upstate New York and they'll make whatever custom design you give them. They also get over $400 for their basic off-the-rack packs (which don't come in any kind of camo). That's probably why the other Anon mentioned your cheap headphones.
I'm just saying, based on your current purchases I don't get the sense that you could or would pay for something quality. 
I have no idea what items you are even looking for or what conditions you're expecting. Anything from Forloh to Enlightened Equipment to Appalachian Gear Co. might work but you're such a fucking mentally ill moron that you'll move the goalposts anyway.
NTA but I have a 400-dollar bag and 10-dollar earbuds. It's all about priorities.
but your headphones do suck... and you're also wearing them while being out. lmao
calls others mentally ill
thinks everyone he responds to is the same person
Are the "goalposts" in the room with us now, anon?
If two people have that same jacket I'll be impressed. Regardless of who I'm responding to the response is the same.
That's because you're a lying sack of english shit. 
Also you can't read. Kifari is spelled 'Kifaru' and they have a 7800 Cubic Inche pack. That's 128 litres to save your fat hands from taking 4 weeks to do the math you retard faggot. 
Add to that most of them are made expandable for external load carrying and extra hunt packing meat as well as other extra loads. 
Unlike you, who swallows your own loads daily instead of carrying them into you dead cunt of a mother. 
Learn to fucking read. Pedo fuck.
NTA but the fact you can only list a single exception out of the entire lineup isn't the gotcha you think it is. Stop malding.
What is an expandable pack and why is it listed?
There's your second one, go lie somewhere else you're outed here twice.
Pretty teats desu. 
The main zip portions won't stand overpacking and have a weird shape when they're underpacked that lets everything else flop about. 
Not terrible straps but the mesh is cheese grater grade
corrects others' spelling
inche
What did he mean by this
Makes you into >>2570168 Pic related when you reply and give a fuck while other poster demostrates he doesen't need to. Nice. Long game.
why do you have a diarrhea filter on your camera?
Got an ALICE for free from one of my old psgs. Is good nuff
Do you guys carry medical supplies or a first aid kit when out? What should go into? I'm creating an IFAK so far I have:
- gauze
- gauze sponges
- self-adhesive fixation bandage
- adhesive skin tape
- adhesive wound dressing
- Ibuprofen
- topical antibiotic cream
I'm not certain what that means, but that photo was taken in my garage, late at night and under fluorescent lights.
 For a long time during the 70's, 80's and 90's every construction site in germany had some workers wearing flecktarn pants.
Speaking of fake, as the german ‚Flecktarn‘ starting to be issued after 1990 and did not hit the milsurp stores before ca 1997 for used clothing. The RAL oliv was still handed out in 1998, as there was not enough Flecktarn available for the whole army.

Tick removal tool and alcohol (wipes)
Any of you guys have any experience with the Savotta Jaakari S? I already have a Stubben and I was gifted a larger 55 liter pack, so I'm just looking for something well made thats lighter than the Stubben for small daytrips/hikes.
I have one. Good size, way overengineered, and you can strap shit to the outside if you want more capacity. I use it for overnighters in the summer, holds everything I need. Anons shit on it because of the shoulder straps but I've never had an issue with them. If you don't like them you can always get pads instead of tampons.
If you don't like them you can always get pads instead of tampons.
?
Anyone here have the M? Considering it but concerned about the weight (1.75kg/3.85 lbs) over long distance versus packs 1-2 pounds lighter
I carry a 1.75kg bag. I had to train my hamstrings a bit but now it's fine.
To give a helpful answer, in a thread full of fags.
Millitaries use many kinds of bag and they may serve your purpose just as they serve the millitaries purpose. 
duffel bags
Huge capacity, carried in the hands short distances. 
If you can fit everything in a large backpack do that instead; but when you can't then carry your huge backpack in one hand and your duffel bag in the other, possibly with a small backpack as well. This is how you carry 6 months worth of personal items 500 meters.
large backpacks aka.ratpacks
Not for field use, they're how you get 10km with half your personal effects of you were matching behind a truck or somthing. 
Worn too high on the back to get through woods/brush but along a road or path they are fine. 
assault pack
The only type of bag you don't see outside the military. 
It's got a few features other bags dont, it's a daypack made from heavy material rather that very light material, it's got waist straps so you can spin around quickly without losing balance (a pain on a regular day bag), and its got external pouches/MOLE for said pouches which is inefficient in terms of space. 
You might use an assault pack if you were hunting, trapping, or working in dense woods doing something like land care or orienteering.
Pro tip: if you get one that's not le army colours people won't think you're a fag, even if you've got to dye a surplus canvas bag. 
I own an alice style bag because I work in land care, and value the external frame because I'm often leaving the bag in one place and using the frame to ruck bullshit like tyres out of the woods
Don't own one but I don't like these parcel top bags, they are handy but you end up getting shit in the opening. The normal hiking bag tops are much better
What you need to understand about this board is american backpack culture. American packs top out around 90-100L tops, Mystery Ranch, Eberlestock, Kifari ... none offer above 100L.
European packs, you can get 130L from TT, Karrimor, Berghaus, .... and Berggans or Norrøna will even sell you 160L.
Why is this? "Americans are sissies" is not a real answer, not that it's not true but no one on any continent carries more shit than they have to.
This "more shit" americans carry, they keep it in their smaller backpacks, yeah? Nice logic faggot.
What are Europeans doing with those dozens of extra liters?
We keep our continental superiority in it.
My superiority seems to have lead to some buttmad.
"them" being the shoulder straps. You know, you can pad them. With pads. Because you're a woman if you need padding.
1-2 pounds lighter
lol wut, just put the bag on and walk, kek
multi-day hikes
I've gone backpacking for weeks with packs like this, and I wasn't even hunting and fishing. Would bring iodine or some means to purify water, so you don't have to haul a ton of water and can refill a canteen for drinking and showers. If you bring a rifle or trotline or a means to trap and catch fish and game, you can survive as long as you choose. Assuming you have the survival skills.
I've gone backpacking for weeks with packs like this
Not any special tactical gear, just normal civilian backpacking packs. They are pretty damn tall, you can fit tents, clothes, survival gear, dry foods, even an upright rifle inside or strapped to the side.
This is especially nice if you are doing something like canoe or kayak camping. But any physically fit hiker should be able to cover 15 miles at 2-3 mph pace in under 8 hours. If you are particularly fit and strong, you could carry a serious pack for 30 miles in 10 hours in a single day. Now imagine doing these long hikes all day, every day, then setting up camp in a new place every night. That's backpacking and it is a lot of hard work, but it is a great adventure.
jfc anon
Yeah I kind of suspect it doesn't matter much? But everyone makes out like it does, that you'll feel a fatigue difference off something like that. I'm kind of in a weird position experience wise because I've basically only used heavily built huge >75 liter loaded up packs or ultralight, at most a framesheet, &lt;45 liter ones.
Military styled packs = shit.
People who cry over the weight of the bag should probably just stay indoors. At the end of the day, if you like the bag and it holds your shit, then it's fine.
I have one. It's okay. I wouldn't really recommend it over just getting the medium though. The older I get the more trouble my shoulders give me, and this pack is just starting to become too annoying to carry over 10 miles.
Pro tip: if you get one that's not le army colours people won't think you're a fag, even if you've got to dye a surplus canvas bag.
Ive been seriously thinking about this. 
Ive picked up a Tasmanian Tiger backpack (pic related, same color too), I absolutely love it since I can fit a prime lens + cameras inside and carry a sturdy tripod too. I can be birding for a week+ with all the extra space. 
But I really dislike its color and the attention it attracts. Do you have experience with dyes that you would recommend? I was considering glueing fluro patches on it. 
Thank you in advance anon
the attention it attracts
If you care that much about what people think of your bag, you should go further away from people or stay home
Yes, they're very well built. Highly recommend, love my Ute. Very easily to strap other packs, pouches, etc. on the outside as well. Comfiest bag I've ever had.
I can Garantee normies don't give a fuck, you are just used to 4chan OMG LOOK A LARPER HE'S LARPING REEE if they see olive drab
Depends if you live near faggy cities, or hike near fag trails like pct, at, alps, kungsleden and such.
My brother bought like 3k of fucking finish milspec gear
alps
I hike regularly in the alps with the exact same backpack. Normies don't give a shit and boomers think I'm serving in the military (which they like)
boomers think I'm serving in the military
Common sign of autism if you can't pick up on those things.
They are lowkey angry at you for not spending 2k at globetrotter or naturkompaniet or whereever you are from for the mandatory neon skintight tourist uniform.
not really. The boomers I've met up until now are very fond of people who join the military and usually want to chat about current military affairs or exercises
 >80L big boy packs
Eh, if it's for you, it's for you. I used to have pic related, and my scout troop would clear 20-30 miles a day. We'd go out for a few days and sometimes had week or two long trek. We just didn't know anything about weight management and trekking poles, just a bunch of young dudes with the skills and fitness level to be out there that long. We joke around about how'd we would've been pretty speedy if we knew then what we know now.
About 2-3 years ago I took an 80L pack and maxed out my weight to something like 50 pounds, and hiked 67 miles in three days. I was doing lots of cardio and weight training, the only problem is the weather took a bad turn and I couldn't keep my feet dry. So yea, it's doable, just no preferable. I have a 50L pack and like to keep it below 20lbs nowadays.
Not the same person you are replying to, but when I got out of the military, I went on a couple long hikes with big weight in a big pack. I dunno why you're being a miserable faggot about it.
several people eventually became crippled because of it.
Calling bullshit. The only people I knew that actually were ever injured were the ladies, and it was usually some kind of leg/hip injury. It was either that or someone that was fat, and everything in the military is going to suck and probably cripple you if you stay fat.
That's a great pack, ALICE packs are great in general.
Can I strap a rifle to the side of an ALICE pack?
If not, what's a good pack that I can do that with?
Preferably in flecktarn, because that camo suits the region I live in the best.
On a side note, is the Direct Action Dragon Egg backpack any good? Either as a simple day pack or a SHTF trunk bag.
flecktarn
The BW combat rucksack has straps specifically for attaching a rifle.
You could lay it length wise across on the top and under the straps lol, but doors might be a problem. I think they sell rifle mounts that work with ALICE packs, check it out.
Direct Action Dragon Egg backpack 
MOLLE backpacks in general
Ah fuck, I dunno lol. I bought a small flecktarn assault pack from Mil-Tech, I use it all the time for short hikes and disc golf. The Dragon Egg looks good, just compare it with other MOLLE packs and decide what the best deal is for you. I think they're somewhat overrated and not as spacious as advertised.
And doing that will fucking destroy your joints. The US Military, especially the Army's concept of physical training for soldiers is totally fucked and they've been slowly trying to change it for a few years now.

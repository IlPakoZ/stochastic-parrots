I know there has to be some kayakers, spearfishing, surfing, freediving, scuba, efoiling, kite boarding Anons on this board. 
What's your favorite thing to do when you leave the house and enter the primordial ooze that is water.
Small boat sailing
For me it's scuba
I love freediving. Fucking get as high as mushrooms when I dive past 150ft. Nitrogen narcosis is a helluva drug.
Could just take some shrooms then
x kayaker, sailer, surfer etc
Live just down the road from the water, usually be for an offshore kayak fish right now and smash some snapper, but the surf and wind are out of control
Stay safe out their bois, seen some big sharks recently

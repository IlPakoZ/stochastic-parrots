any /out/ist have any handicaps? ranging from hayfever to more serious things?
If you count crippling autism and schizophrenia; then 90% of this board is disabled.
Include retardation, and it’s 99.9999% (I’m the exception, obviously:) )
of course, schizophrenia, autism, and terminal mental retardation. speaking for myself, I don't know what everyone else's deal is
I herniated a disc in my back years ago and need to take a short break to stretch every once in a while. No big deal really, but I don't do long hikes through rough territory anymore.
autism and brain damage
I have been diagnosed with SGMS (sluggish gluteus maximus syndrome, aka laziness of the ass) that greatly impacts my ability to enjoy the outdoors. I have applied to get governmental support.
I've had knee surgery and my back and joints are all fucked up from a decade of physical labor. I've got a genetic collagen issue that makes my joints all loose. It means I get tired more easily and will be in pain before anyone else. You suck it up and deal with it. I'm 30. I'm way more stiff than people my age with the same activity level. I have to train harder than my peers and it does more damage to my body. 
I take breaks when I need them and don't do physical activities unless it "feels" right. Still go scrambling in boulder fields in the middle of nowhere. I don't let anyone rush me. Know your limits and be realistic with yourself.
I have horrendous allergies 3/4 of the year for most of my life, peaking from 2017-2022. I have no clue what changed but this year I have barely needed any anti-histamine, whereas before winter time was the only period I had a break. Usually I was taking ephedrine daily to cope with the intense inflammation and fatigue, last year even needing albuterol to beat lung inflammation back. For those of you who have similar circumstances, I tried some nasal spray with xylitol for about 2 months to kill any fungal growth in my sinuses and that may or may not have helped. I did most of my outdoors during the winter when everything was dead but maybe this year I can finally enjoy some spring/summer time.
I’m diabetic. The real disease not the fat people ailment. My energy levels are not what they should be and I have to carry a lot of extra stuff as well as manage a lot of extra economies as I hike. Long trips are significantly more complicated. But I get into all national parks for free so there’s that
Not nearly as bad for me but I was perpetually sniffly until I discovered fluticasone spray. Before that I would just pop a benadryl and power through the drowsiness, one time I got it so bad I could barely see because my eyes were basically flooded.
i have Osteopetrosis, essentially, my bones are garbage.
so i go slower on descents, and take less risks of falling
I have nerve damage all down the left side of my ribcage and my stress level has an impact on its severity. When I'm /out/ the pain is greatly diminished to the point I forget that I have to take my pain meds.
that's like afrin right? Those things have crazy rebound friend. The one thing that killed all my symptoms for a short time was prednisone, and I felt the best I had in 10 years but the problem is those drugs rape your immune system. 
Its honestly a balance between symptom management and not being on poisonous drugs. Most of my symptoms were concentrated in my nose and chest, with the chest issue being aggravated by post nasal drip. Have you dried drugs with psuedo/regular ephedrine before? It clears up chest and nose like no other and obviously has no drowsiness but its bad for your heart long term.
Supposedly doesn't cause rebound, can give me a nasty sore throat though if I'm not careful in administering. 
I agree, I've taken to drinking more tea as a result. Mucinex does wonders for my chest congestion but I think that's a result of my former weed habit.
Do you sink in water? Did it influence your facial bones? That's a rare one.
I have really shitty eyes, both of them are around -12.
Do you sink in water?
no not really, used to do a lot of swimming when i was younger
Did it influence your facial bones?
no, i am short though, and my right leg is slightly shorter then my left but not enough to cause problems
i mainly just have complications from old fractures and the hospital are starting to check my blood more due to increasing levels of iron, for some reason, actually have a honest to god bloodletting session next week to see if that helps lol
yea, its pretty shit, but hey, never lived without it so i cant say!
the outdoors should be accessible to all
I have erectile dysfunction, does that count?
i mean, could indicate blood circulation issues, so ... i guess
how did you get Brian damage?
speech impediment. being alone in the wilderness is the only place i dont constantly feel like a reject
stay strong king
I've got PTSD, Fibromyalgia and some other mental disorders which nobody will believe me if I said them
However, mobility aids like walking sticks or trekking poles are more or less normalized while outdoors so I can use my mobility aids without lookin like a 22 year old faker
Being /out/ actually really helps with my PTSD for obvious reasons. I think the best part of it is when there's no internet and whoever you're going with (or if you're just going solo) has to be in the moment and can't text their 500 fuckboys on snapchat or whatever and you can actually have normal interactions with them
How did ypu get PTSD, if ypu don't mind me asking? I have a friend, tank driver, military man through and through, and he always says he just doesn't know who he is when not deployed so he just keeps signing up for tours, making music helps him though, top bloke
45-year-old hypochondriac roastie detected
Serial neglect, my 3 older siblings beat the shit out of me and I wasn't ever allowed to have friends growing up
I'm 22 and chronic pain is a bitch
I still rock climb tho but it fucking sucks when walking to and from classes makes me want to curl up into a ball and die
Anon I'm a type 1 and feel great. Take better care of yourself or else the fat type 2s win. Also how do you get into parks for free?
The cardiovascular strain from lifetime elevated A1C is measurable and impactful. I’m still faster and stronger than most people but it’s a handicap none the less. For the card, We’re covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Go to a local ranger station and fill out a piece of paper, they give you a card then and there. Free admittance and vehicle access to all national parks for life.
I have arm pain, probably RSI with tendinosis 
Day hikes are kino but I’m not getting a pair of trekking poles anytime soon
A shame, really, because for some summit hikes here, one good wind blast could push you over the edge for 1000' roll downhill 
Had to chicken out and not go because it was windy one day
Jehovas Witnesses or something? shit bro, stay strong
Not so much a handicap but I have ADHD and when I go hiking it normally takes me forever to do a hike because I always get distracted looking at cool shit. Sometimes quite literally shit. Like whenever I see wombat's shit I will intently stare at it and try to figure out how old it is and where this wombat is going and what he ate.
My gf usually has to force me to keep going
If it were from a cult or something, I'd at least have some fingers to point, but nope my parents were just that fucking evil
I have good news and bad news
Depression. I almost killed myself on my last outing.
do you have any support structure around you? please reach out
Just the normal crippling back pain from living a life of outdoor sports and working like a motherfucker in the outdoors. Athletes die twice.
Chemical or environmental? I was in a fucking horrendous state until I started going back to Church.
same here, it's insane how stimulating nature is. I would've thought I'd find it much more boring than normal people do, but no, I can just sit forever listening to the subtlest of sounds or go around looking for lichens or some shit.
autism, the diagnosed kind not the everyone is a schizo autist retard I wanna feel special kind mentioned in 2550820
For me it's A HD TV
I have always had a hyper focused fascination with animals and nature.
It's so comfy
Yes, I have insomnia and when I am /out/ the shadow people don't come for me, rather its just a friendly night animal like a wombat or possum looking for some bread
my right elbow is fucked. i cant straighten that arm at all. its not painful tho so ive learned to live with it.
also im deadly allergic to cats. entered the tent of a cat owner and withing 30min was wheezing &amp; dying. real shame cos i like cats
we used to have a cat as kid, my dad loved it and it loved him, would sleep on him on the couch and genuinely be worried if he didnt come home, but then he became allergic.
thankfully it could be taken by my moms sisters friend and it is now in South Africa, it still reacts seeing my dad on facetime calls though
not strictly /out/ but a pretty funny moment yesterday, i´m going in to get my blood tapped, for increased levels of iron in my blood, liver and heart.
i stroll in, not really giving a shit because i am completely desensitized to hospital stuff at this point, just sit down on a chair, now this dawns on me, this is not just a blood test, when i see the size of the needle.
eh, fuck it whatever.
in comes another patient, guy, maybe mid forties, former military, nervous as fuck, and im just telling stories, feeling the warm red juice leaving my body, and i notice im slurring my words
and i fucking black out, one second a cute medical student is taking my blood, next 3 doctors 
at least i got a yoghurts and apple juice, worst part is that they think they might need to do that either once a week or every seccond week
me to tough army guy
who am i, where am i? orange juice? yea nice!
Same, always pack way more food than I need but all the same, the worry of a serious low out in the backcountry haunts me.
you get a discount on camping/use permits on most federal land as well. Recreation/gov website will let you input your America the Beautiful access pass when checking out.
Where’s all the iron coming from? Are you going to have to do this forever, or just until your iron levels get normal and stay there?
Where’s all the iron coming from?
i eat a bowl of nails for breakfast, no lol, its just that my body doesnt get rid of it like normal, so its probably been piling up for years
first we are going to see if we can get it to normal levels, then more test to see if it rises again, then probably forever
I had pretty damn bad eyesight, -7,5 in both eyes. 
I had to wear bottle-end thick eyeglasses, and if I misplaced or lost them, I was seriously limited on what I could do.
Took a femtolasik laser surgery and now my eyesight is good enough that I could get a pilots license without any need for glasses.
Best damn thing I ever got. really felt like I was out of crutches.
Best part is that even if shit hits the fan and I go completly broke and bankrupt, the repo-men will NOT take my eyes back.
Forgot to tie my bootlaces once, left fly unzipped one morning, also once went for a hike with a haircut I ended up not really being in love love with so I would say adversity and I are old comrades. Rise above. Be the change you believe in want to seeing.
Does browsing 4Chan count?
that would be the free square in the /out/ disability bingo card
Does mental shit count?
I have a shit-ton of mental illnesses. But that all wouldn´t matter, if I didn´t have Agroaphobia.
I literally can´t leave my home for a distance longer than 30 minutes, or else I get panic attacks, to the point of fainting and/or throwing up.
I can´t do shit. I have all this gear, even though it´s just milsurp, and I can´t put it to use because my faggot brain decides to become an absolute retard the second I step outside.
My entire life is a fucking prison. I want to get a motorcycle, travel the Balkans on it, camping in the wild...
Can´t do anything. I´m working on it though, if I feel up to the task.
I go on walks in the night sometimes, and I try to self medicate with a root-powder called Ashwaganda, and it really helps.
I hope someday I´ll get over this fucking shit. I really hate sitting at home my whole life.
I've got mild cerebral palsy in my legs, but when medicated it's not too bad. I can walk almost as much as much as the next person (but it never feels like much fun). When people say "I've got bad knees" and they actually mean it, that's about the level I'm at. 
As long as I don't walk too far while out, or carry too much weight, I'll be fine.
Just find a way to procure a few acres in remote territory and work remotely, that way your land is just an extension of your home. Any trespassers spell icup with their life and you get to live in solitude with nature.
Thanks for the advice, but I live in cucked Germany.
And my mental health makes it impossible for me to hold a job long enough to save up money.
But I´m sure things will get better, and I´ll get out of this. 
Even though I´ve been severely mentally ill for almost 20 years now. Started in my early teens.
But I´m working on it. My next step is getting a drivers license. That way I´ll use my car as some kind of FOB, to retreat to whenever I get panic attacks.
Key is never giving up, and I don´t plan on doing so.
God is good anon. Keep pushing through the bullshit. Go outside and hold the beautiful German soil in your hands for me and I'm not even kidding, doesn't even matter if you're in a city and that soil comes from a tree planted next to the curb. I owe half of my blood to that land, we're here talking over 4chan but connected to a a greater tree a thousand years before. Isn't it incredible? We are blessed in such small ways that its honestly hard to see them as we try and trudge through the tough day to day grind made even more difficult by our personal illnesses and issues. 
We'll make it brother. Don't give up.
This may sound like a meme but before I always had pretty bad allergies (tonsillitis) but when I started taking purely cold showers around 6-7 months ago it drastically reduced my fatigue. I think it has to do with regulating body temperature. That and I also stopped drinking coca cola sodas and much less soda in general and I started drinking a bunch of water and I feel pretty normal.
kek
I drink yogitea (original) right now. Just one bag for like 1.5-2 Liters. It's pretty awesome.
Oh, I also got an amputated right leg.
I'm to ambitious with walking actually, so my doc told me to keep it light on walking.
I'll get a new prosthesis next week, so I'll be back in the game.
I live a 5 min walk from the next lake and the next forest. It's very tempting.
autism, chronic sinusitis and tinnitus that I know off. But there's also something wrong with the left side of my head, which gives me blurry vision in one eye, migraines, this weird "shaky" feeling in my ear when I smile, and if I go underwater my ear hurts. It's been like this for like 6 years now and I haven't bothered to get it checked, despite it really affecting my sleep and makes me really stressed out sometimes, it's also why I can't sleep outside anymore, that and the tinnitus. 
I hate going to the doctor as I feel like a crybaby going there and it's such a hassle, so it is what it is
Dude. I'm like totally retarded.
You fucking need to get that shit checked. I've spent some time half deaf and after years I went to check it out and three weeks later I had perfect stereo hearing.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Where do I even start and say to the doctor?
One problem, next problem, the problem after that. Most of that can be helped.
Where are you from, what's the insurance situation?
I'm a few pounds overweight and wear glasses
for the other hayfever/allergies bros i reccomend getting mizollen 10mg mizolastine pills. They cut out about 70-80% of my symptoms, although i usually use them with a nasal spray too. They seem pretty expensive online but i get them for free in my country so i guess it depends where you live.
I have a slightly bum leg. a congenital deal that left me with less muscle in my right leg and a bit shorter. It sucks but I have never let it stop me getting /out. I dont hike fast or even super far but I do get out. I also, bike, ski, fish etc...but hiking is where it come most into play. trekking poles rule and allow me to go farther.
and you post on /out/
Yeah I'm retarded
I can live with the upper two but my back problem affects my /out/ings and makes me want to KMS
bum knee from an accident. i fuck it up and have to hobble after every single backpacking trip, so i can rarely do more than 2 nights without risking myself getting stranded.
You live in snap city, not the outdoors sorry bro
Stage 4 autism
Same.
Woulda been a good spot too.
Same, then I go home and look a google earth a few hours a day till I go out again. Got to know the size of the catchment area and all that important stuff.
Crippling porno addiction. I wish I was joking. 
And why did we shorten “pornography” to “porn” when “porno” was perfectly sufficient? Why doesn’t anyone say “porno” anymore?
Cerebral Palsy, but its pretty minor. Just means that I walk with a limp and have weaker legs than average.
Crohn's disease which made me basically not go outside from age 13-30 until I got a colostomy. Always scared of shitting myself, or if I could find a toilet, of being stuck there for an hour while people had to wait for me. Not able to eat because eating means shitting, always malnourished. Now, with the colostomy, shitting and eating is no longer a problem, but I feel a little more fragile considering the risk of getting a hernia while stretching/lifting is severe and I'm always carrying my fucking exposed intestines around in front of me. 
Also, massive massive ADHD like that other guy. If a sign says "1 hour" it's gonna take me 2 because every tree is more interesting than the one before. And I need to bring weed and a bottle of wine everywhere I go.
All in all, it's alright if I'm not doing anything longer than 8 hours.
Based nature enjoyer
I have a severe condition that causes my hands and crotch to be constantly sticky. it started happening around the time I turned 12 and my parents kept telling me not to touch myself in public, but it just itched so bad it was unreal. thankfully when i'm /out/ there aren't many people to harass me about my condition, and those that do I just look them dead in the eye while I rub my itch and they go away.
Crohn's disease
I had a couple girlfriend's who had that. I kind of think they thought I was dating material since I wasn't judgemental. One I wasn't physically intimate with because I was kind of awkward and the other I took to prom and made out with after. The first was morbidly obes but surprisingly strong. The second was almost anorexic but actually cute and funny which was why I asked her to prom. Neither one told me much about how Crohn's disease effected their life other than restricting their diet. The first girl needed surgery but she's got kids now so I guess she's doing okay. I hope everything works out for you anon, remember you're not alone.
I can empathize personally with this one. I have ADD so while I'm not as hyperactive most of the time, I get spaced out and distracted easily. Just today I was on a riverpath in my city and I spotted a snapping turtle on a rock just off the bank. My first thought was to try sneaking up and catching it, so I crept down the 6 foot bank, nearly slipping more than once. I stood on the floodplain (flat area near the water that get flooded frequently and waited to see if it saw me. It kept looking around and tucking it's heaf in it's shell away from me, but I was cautious nonetheless. On a side note I think this is what distinguishes ADD from ADHD, because if I was hyperactive I probably would have just gone straight for it rather than cautiously sit and observe. Just as I had stood up to move toward it again some guy walking his dog asked me how I got down there. He came down to wash his leash in the river, walked towards the turtle without ever seeing it as it jumped in the water, probably because of his sunglasses. He was a nice guy, we chatted about dogs and hiking for a bit before he left.
I truly believe ADD/ADHD exists because of hunting. Our ancestors needed to be constantly on the look out for signs that something was trying to hide from us. Don't take it for granted.
nope but i still use the disabled people bathroom stall because fuck you you dont get to feel special because you were born too retarded to move your legs
That’s not a seve-, what the fuck?
it's joke about puberty.
Anon pls go to the doctor desu don't make me worry about you

whats the general best shape of gourd?
i'm at a cross between bushel gourd &amp; water jug; leaning heavily towards bushel, however
while water jug is easy to make into a simple canteen, a bowl, a scoop, and even a few other small things, the bushel gourd has the ability to store a HUGE amount of food, supplies, water, or even be turned into hat, all with total ease that very few things can replicate, even just until modern day 
the only problem with bushel gourd is that its just so big &amp; round, which is also the reverse situation with the water jug gourd
i've yet to see a really good example of molds being used on gourds other than making a little face or small decorative bottle; i can only imagine to what an extensive amount of shapes could be created via a bushel gourd &amp; a complex mold 
what experience do you guys have with any of this? it would be greatly appreciated for you to give any advice at all
I'd reckon this is a bushel, interesting.
West Africans use gourds to make a West African classical instrument called a kora, which was played in the courts of kings and rulers.
The kora sounds quite nice, but it eventually became the banjo for West Africans that were stolen from Africa and brought to America, which is a familiar and characteristic instrument of Appalachia.
Here is some gourd music for your earholes, as played in the courts of medieval kings.

Last couple years I've planted gourds to sell. I take them to city 40 miles from me. I get between $2-$5 a piece. I also make bird houses out them for fun.
What do these taste like 
Is it like pumpkin or
They are dried out and used to make different things like bottles, boxes, canteens, birdhouses, ladles, etc. You can eat very small gourds when they're tender. Otherwise they get tough as they grow

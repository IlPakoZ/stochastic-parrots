What do these guys who shoot hundreds of doves do with the bids? I don't think they're processing them and making them into pies. Do they leave them to rot? feed them to dogs?
I would assume they take them to a processor. Or else they divy them up and flash freeze them then take them home for their wives to clean. 
Personally I don't even dress my own deer anymore. I just take them to the processors still steaming hot.
Wait until this faggot hears about a freezer.
But for real though I'd kill for a pile of quail like that. Delicious. Probably these guys had a feed of 12-15 people, and then froze the rest. I would also be AMAZED if those were all wild quail. More likely pen raised and then left out on a ranch.
Idk but I imagine putting poultry in a pile like that so it can get nice and warm in the middle is a great idea.
with doves you're only harvesting the breast meat so it doesn't take long to clean and processes them. it also means you generally need to shoot a lot of them
how much shot is usually in a bird when you shoot it anyways
None it'll pass thru most times
Judging by how white these guys are they definitely made jalapeno poppers wrapped in bacon
I tend to find one or two pellets per year when cleaning birds and I tend to clean 20+ birds per year.
They 100% process them and eat them judging from the fact that they picked up their shells
I grew up shooting birds. even on my worst days with seed out in the fields, i'd had never came close to the amount of these dorks have in front of them, even if you were to divide the pile evenly by all 8 of them.
Boomer hunters tend to not bother with the whole carcass, even on larger birds like geese and ducks. They just pull the breast out and yeet the rest, that's a pretty quick process and I would bet if they all chipped in it wouldn't take that long honestly.
I've done a few hunts in Argentina where a group of 4-6 of us would shoot ~14k pigeons in a day. What happens is a bunch of locals on dirtbikes show up with trash bags and take them to their families for food. So if this is in latin america, they' probably won't be wasted.
That's just weird and I don't like it
SHEWWWWW
The meat on that pile of birds probably would equal a small deer. You just step on the wings and pull the legs and the breast meat pops out. Then you just peel the breasts off. Most people make sausage with it.
No you fucking didn't.
Thats about 2400 birds per person. Let's say you hunted a long ass 12 hour day. That's 200 birds and an hour, per person. Thats a 3.3 birds, per minute, per shooter, for 12 fucking hours straight.
Just shut the fuck up next time
If you suck... a lot. If you're decent, not much.
Whoa lets cool it with the antisemitism
Yeah I took the pic from a page of an Argentinean wing shooting ranch in BookYourHunt.

is it actually possible to just camp anywhere in the wilderness in someplace like canada? (searching it up seems to say yes but id feel retarded if i just picked a random spot on google maps and went) ive wanted to camp near this mountainside in BC
it's only illegal if you get caught trespassing.
look up who owns the area and then decide if it's worth crossing them
sure, if there is no trail it means you get to blaze a new one.
Usually you can camp on Crown lands for up to 21 days till you have to move, there are also other places to camp but check it out first.
Also, check out the ihunter app.

that's a good camp spot
well done OP. just do it. I would advise you set up camp after nightfall in case she's still up.
I live in the Okanagan, BC anon. I just contacted the BC Natural Resource Services asking about camping on crown land. The answer is that while there is Crown Federal, Provincial, and Municipal Land in BC, you are only allowed to "wild camp" in Crown Provincial Land which is outside of municipal (city) borders. Check IMap BC for more info. The Ministry of Forests has also set up "Recreation sites" which are on crown land, some of which have camping pads and amenities. Some you pay at while others are free:

by any chance do any of you know if a 7 ft spear is effective against wildlife

depends, how effective are you at using a 7 ft spear against wildlife?
This here map is the best one I could find of where the crown land is. The grey is what you want. Purple is private property
If nobody knows you are or ever were there then nothing is off-limits.
Steve Wallis asserts that it is.
People in BC are super friendly and pretty much are familiar with the LAW that says you can camp anywhere, as long as you let the property owner know when you show up. Just knock on the door and say "I'll be using this land for a few days" and set up your tent.
Yeah public land is fine for camping, just be prepared. You can even fish and hunt on public land, though I don't know the law in BC. It's best not to leave a trace as well, as if you were never there, it is good stewardship of the environment. It is also a challenge to do stealth camping, where you camp undetected and leave without a trace, legally of course. This is not even broaching the subjects of dugouts, tunnels, and caves.

Down here you might get blasted with rock salt trying to camp on someone's random private property, but there is a lot of wild land and public lands.

There is something to be said about being hidden, concealed, camping in complete and perfect privacy. A pit shelter, hidden with a tarp and debris. A small tent hidden with bushcraft. It's very comfortable.
I'd be too concerned about randos fucking up my woods and/or getting themselves killed. Imagine saving for years to get a nice piece of land and then finding corpses while you're out for a walk because some idiot didn't layer properly.
Nigger mentality
well, for public land, or land owned by some non-resident entity (say a logging company or NGO) i don't care. they don't deserve the right to gate keep locals.
That said, it's a very very very different scenario if it's a private party's land who lives on it, or works it

Not OP but this is my basic summer motohammocking gear so far. Anything to change or improve upon for a noob? I am needing ideas for food, but I'll probably just go with ramen, oats, and chili cans. Not pictured:
underquilt/topquilt (ordered)
backpack (don't yet know what to get, maybe Nunatak Bears Ears and get a bear canister)
"or, should I go with a bear bag"
toiletries (I use my camping toiletries at work)
clothing (unnecessary)
what does /out/ think of Leatherman multitools? They seem almost shilled but maybe they are just that good...
black people don't go in the woods...
Animals have more rights than you. Will you fight the antichrist or die fearing being labeled a nigger. Everything modern nations have was stolen. You support the biggest nigger around.

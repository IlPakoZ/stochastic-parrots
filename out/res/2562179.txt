what's the point of them?
and uh that's all i can think of at the moment but regardless though tents are better. The only pro of the tarp is low profile and extremely cheap.
It’s a Southwest/California/we know it’s not going to rain/bugs don’t live here thing. You can try it in the south then for some reason it storms in October and you wake up with a chigger infestation. 
That said, a tarp and bug bivy combo is both lighter and cheaper than most tents, and solves the bug problem.
A thread died for this bait
big fire incoming
ventilation. I can keep my propane buddy heater running as long as I want with no carbon monoxide worries. don't need to worry about bugs if it's cold enough for the heater.
I just bought an 8x10 ft tarp. Anybody know some good pitches?
Lighter maybe if you buy a good tarp and not a heavy DD standard, because it’s not fully enclosed, but that makes it worse for storms.
It’s not really significantly cheaper tho.
A borah bug bivy and decent 20D tarp will still be $150-$180.
A lanshan 1 is definitely cheaper than that, and an x-mid 1 is only $220, and you can actually sit upright in those.
Ayo who tf using my picture??? Get your own /out/ content, you bum ass nigga!
The tarp is more compact than just about any tent. So if you're trying to save on pack space, tarps are the way to go. The spectacular ventilation also prevents my stuff from getting damp overnight.
Bingo. Tarps work really well for winter camps if you don't want to spring for a hot tent. It's way less weight than a hot tent as well. It's more fuss, considering the fire is harder to maintain, but the cost-effectiveness and versatility is hard to beat.
I wouldn't dream of taking my tarp above the treeline. But for any other terrain it's really good. It's light, compact, cheap, and lets you pitch a quick shelter wherever there's enough of a windbreak. That's the strength of a tarp.
I like pic rel for solo camping. Just stake in the middle of the farthest side, stake out both near corners, pitch the middle of the near side to a tree, and adjust the stake tension. Roll the spare flaps underneath the shelter.
huge larp but fun when you are a bug
Also what do y'all use for guylines?
550 cord.
Yes, under load and over time. No, not enough that it matters. They're guy lines, not radio tower wires.
Thanks for letting us know.
See >>2562472
lmao
They protect you and your gear from the elements. I use a tarp for chilling in the daytime and a tent for sleeping in. Also this is a bad thread and you should feel bad. Use your critical thinking faculty before making any more stupid threads please.
I actually was camping with my eldest son during Hurricane Ida in '21. It was only a tropical storm by the time it got this far north but it was still a solid 36 hour downpour with gusts over 30mph. I re-pitched our mess fly much lower to the ground so it would at least keep shit covered, and we hunkered down in the tent. 550 Paracord held that fly in place no problem. Might not be hurricane-proof but it's close enough for this side of the Appalachians.
Makes you wonder what kind of winds these other anons are camping in that they claim 550 can't handle
To be fair to the other anon, it's possible I wouldn't have had to change the pitch if I was using Dyneema cord. Then again, it's possible that it would have been fine with the paracord, too.
It is enough to make your tarp droop. 550 was a fad that quickly died among people who actually camp because of this, but it lived on via retarded YouTube survivalist crap.
Because it was dirt cheap, once upon a time. I'm still working through the spool my dad bought in the late 90s.
in the alabama heat and humidity air flow takes is the most important thing. also im a bit claustrophobic. bugs don't ever bother me don't really know why.
Yes, it was a fad. It’s not because I don’t use it. It was popular despite its shortcomings, and now it’s not. That pretty much the definition of a fad.
Except for the fact that it's readily available everywhere you go and lots of people use it with no complaints, yeah, totally not popular, kek
I use 550 for nearly everything and have never had a problem.
People are pussies with bugs nowadays. I live in UK and I know grown men that act like women from a spider the size of a 10p coin and they think I'm nuts just picking them up and putting them outside.
you're right anon my boyfriend really likes to "spread out" if you know what i mean ;)
Imagine how bad it’s going to smell in that tent.
You've obviously never been to the Boreal forest in June.
you just let them bite you right after they appear so you get used to them and wont get any pimples or rashes later in the year and then you just live with them 
nothing aggravates me more than seeing grown men always act like little girls constantly shouting and complaining loudly while waving their hands while /out/, always ruins my good time
you just let them bite you right after they appear so you get used to them and wont get any pimples or rashes later in the year
See: >>2563249
It's easy to say stuff like that when you've never experienced it first-hand.
That's why you go prepared. You don't just "let them bite you" unless you're a larper who never leaves their basement.
but i have lived in finland over 40 years and my dad has taught me /out/ since i was 6
i dont like it when they get trapped between sunglasses and your eye especially while fishing but other than that i never care much about mosquitos
you have clearly never been graced by sleeping in a taj mahooch. they are the best part of being in the field
3mm utility cord, super nice for knots since it dosent stretch
disgusting.
kelty or lawson. 1mm and 1.5mm in 3 seasons, 2.5 or 3mm when its cold. the thin stuff is very strong but becomes troublesome to knot in the cold. generic dyneema cordage isn't as flexible its worth paying more for the nylon sleeved name brand stuff. how thin you should go is pretty much directly proportional to how much you're willing to let knot tying become a pain in the ass in exchange for weight/bulk. 
i use atwood micro cord for almost everything else except guylines.
obligatory skurka's guyline tensioning system blogpost: https://andrewskurka.com/guyline-tension-system-backpacking-tents-tarps-hammocks/
I made some shock cord guylines (not for the ridgeline obviously) but probably half the time I forget them and use whatever I do have which is usually paracord or hemp rope.
tarps are fucking GAY. its GAY. its ANOTHER MAN. YOU'RE FUCKING GAY.
there. i said it.
Sir, the trap thread is over on /gif
3mm cordage
lol wut
bulk
lol wut
oh, now I get it
i dont really like his system, i find a truckers hitch a bit too fiddly and annoying to tie sometimes so i usually do bowline to attach to the stakes and then i attach the other end to my tarp with a tautline hitch
this way you can keep the bowline tied all the time use the same bowline for wrapping the cord, con of this is that you cant keep the rope attached ot the tarp the whole time and keep it in the bag but i dont find that it bothers me
forgot to mention but i use 1.3mm dyneema cord with polyester sheathe so theyre very slippery, with a tautline i wrap it around itself 3-4 times as opposed to twice to add more friction but bowline knots work as normal, i also often use a double fishermans knot if i need to extend the guylines
*permethrins your shit*
pssh, nothin personnel
Tarp will help against FLIR better. Netting helps against bugs
either this or just use a proper repellant. For me its mostly ticks im worried of, but some ballistol bug repellant worked for me. also when having a campfire you could use some resin rich woods for the atherical oils to repell them. Or just stop giving a fuck. A lil bug won't stop me outings
What kind of net for bugs do you recommend?
Works on my machine
Sitting there all fucking day and night when its raining and not being cooped up in a tent is great. You can stand up if you set it up right. Just the other week I watched a thunderstorm pass through the mountains from my tarp 600m up a steep hillside from the river below, pouring rain, dry as can be and the lightning was glowing up all the cloud particles and the forest like we were inside a light bulb. Freaking amazing, my father missed most of it from in his tent. 
Then I went to sleep in my bivy. The next day we had a large area of dry ground under the tarp, excellent.
Oh and we hadn't been able to get to a water source because the storm changed our plans which stopped us going over the top of the mountain. So the tarp can catch a lot of water in a situation like that, it lasted us enough to get back to water which was 2 days after the rain had stopped.
I will try this pitch next time. I need to stop being such a fair weather fairy
Why not just catch the rain water? Thats literally why a tarp is so great
Any netting works. Bury the end and the only thing touching you will be beetles and worms
Here's a pic using both tarp and tent
That's literally what I do...
Your post complained about not being able to reach a water source because you were being rained on. The water source is right above you
No, the post was explaining that the tarp makes it easy to catch water. Read it again slowly. "So the tarp can catch a lot of water in a situation like that" and catch a lot of water it did. 
Also there's no complaining.
Newbie here, how do you attach the bug net to the tarp? Bug nets in my country are things you put over windows, they are inflexible and stiff, not exactly a net but more of a mesh.
Go to Walmart and buy fucking netting from the fabric aisle and save yourself 6 gorillion shekels
Some tarps will have a loop or loops in the inside. If you use a trekking pole to prop it up inside you can tie it to that.
All you need is something to sleep in, something to sleep on, and something to sleep under.
Everything else is totally unnecessary. Don't be a bougie retard
Pic is the Borah Gear bug bivy. The guy lines that hold the bug net up attach to the same poles that hold up the tarp, or are anchored to the same point as the poles. I don’t like this particular design, but you get the idea.
aliexpress bug bivy.
might pick up the winter version too and then bring my tarp above treeline :-D
are you a manlet?
5'9 but its nice since it means i can buy chink gear for nearly 100usd less than the borah stuff kek
in pic i use my jacket as my pillow off the sleeping pad, but the sleeping bag hood and feet still touch the net, i dont find it a problem so long as the net is off my face though
You sure about that? Pic rel.
was thinking of the other one which is around 115
You can use them on inclines. More versatile than a bivy. A symmetrical tarp can be pitched as a tent with a floor.
yeh I suspected that because I have the same shit from ali and it's too tight for someone over 5'11
Bah, everyone posts more than they actually go /out/. I'm a fair-weather fairy myself; notice how the "snowy weather" pitch I showed you was definitely not in the snow. Matter of fact, that was the far North of New Zealand.
Yeah, but this trip >>2563803
ended up being the worst possible scenario: snow, then rain, then subfreezing overnight, and my brother forgot his tent for himself. We were fine, even with my absolute dogshit setup.
Just showed me I need to spend more time outside in bad weather, and the way you pitch that three sided shelter is just how I am going to do it so I can stay comfy.

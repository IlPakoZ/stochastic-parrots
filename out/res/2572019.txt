can anyone find this place in Germany ?
Oh ja, that's Günter's house. Everybody knows Günter.
Better off finding where the photographer lives
Yeah, thats the Old Shiver Mountain:
Altschauerberg 8
91448 Emskirchen
There should be a red Audi A4, Ford Mondeo and perhaps an old fiesta there as well.
Greetings to Rudi aus Buddeln and Rita aus Weiden!
Yep, that's right
Weiden
Holy shit man that's where my mom is from.
ya and she is at my place tonight
I think that's the Berlin fence to the left which means it's just south of Strasbourg north of the river.
Lol his mum is from Rita aus Weiden. Is your gf from Freundin aus Denkne?
Yes, that’s the back alley of Auschwitz.

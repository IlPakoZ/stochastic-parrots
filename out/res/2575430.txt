I give you.... the most divisive plant in the world.
The division is between people who think they're great and people who think they're the greatest.
Great to pick them, although i feel a bit bad i'm stealing all the birds fruit, at the same time horror when these grow in your own garden unchecked.
Only if you live in the north west.
A blackberry? I don't get it.
they spread everywhere and form impenetrable dense thickets
Unlike other plants that do the exact same thing...? I still don't understand why this is supposed to be divisive. I've never heard anyone argue about blackberries.
It's literally just a provincial Washington or Oregon residence thinking they're thought and memes are universal
Always happy to see one of these. Aside from the berries, you can make surprisingly good tea out of the leaves.
I murder the fuck out of Himalayan blackberries.
The division is between retards who muh-berries-reee and non retards that comprehend how aggressively invasive and destructive these fuckers are.
Specifically the Himalayan blackberry--the native trailing are fine because they don't grow as fast and don't grow remotely close to as large as the Himalayans.
Fun fact: you're retarded.
most plants dont form brambles idiot
the joke is they are dividing people on either side of the brambles.
because holy fucking hell these mofos are invasive. delicious, but invasive.
you're doing it all wrong
oh no an edible sweet berry spreads too much, how horrid
Clearly I was correct and struck a nerve.
you're ignoring the razor sharp vines that choke out everything else.
but yes, at least there's an upside to them compared to something like kudzu or hispanics
You can eat kudzu dumb dumb. Or turn it into meat.
hush, adults are speaking
Kudzu grows from Florida to New Jersey, and as far west as West Virginia and East Texas. However, a small patch of it has been found in Clackamas County, Oregon. No one is sure where it came from.
...I need you to dial back your power level display sir. Goatheads and how they got to the USA is... well, I only have so many ways to ban evade homojannemanfaggots obsessed with subhuman cocks.
I want to grow either blackberry, or raspberry, or black raspberry in my yard. The species native to Eastern US. Which should I plant?
7 acres, so you at least have a decent lawn tractor. Cut them down with the mower deck
raspberry
You should getting a better info source. It's all over Maine. 
It's causing problems with fiddle head harvesting.
never had a problem with rubus shrubs, though i live in a climate where they don't do particularly well and the native ones are more prolific. i always like eating them when i find them out bush
They grow near me but I never get any because my dog eats all the berries. He goes crazy on them, like a bear, and he can get the tall ones cuz he's an Irish wolfhound so he's tall
Tbh.
Does enchanted super berry real?
=/
does 4 times more juicy enchanted super berry as in ops pic real or not? =/
My old Bernese used to strip the whole plant, leaves, thorns, berries, and all, when he got a hankering for them.
My poodle does this with blueberries. Luckily there's more there he could eat and lots.of highbush
The birds do not consider the berries to be their private property, that's us. They can always find more berries as long as people respect the environment and do not take more than they need. It grows back.
And the ecology is complex. Certain animals harm the environment, so hunting them is a way to protect the environment. Down here it's the kudzu, which just grows super fast and covers everything. However, it's not useless. It's used as a medicine to stop alcohol cravings for alcoholics, as it contains medicinal alkaloids. Typically a concentrated extract.
I've actually been thinking about making some kudzu extract to mix with local legal hemp extract, to treat withdrawal symptoms for recovering alcoholics. I think it could be a very effective medicine to give to people with alcoholism. Stops the cravings, treats the withdrawal.
Damn that red part looks like my asshole right now
Letâ€™s say hypothetically I wanted to bring it to California, Oregon, or Washington because I fucking despise the left coast. Would it cause harm?
the razor sharp vines
get your work glove on you bitch
choke out yourself cunt
you edgy little zoomer.
thats DOOMER to you, cunt
no cause they would appreciate a new species to increase the somewhat lacking biodiversity of the region
The division is between retards who muh-berries-reee and non retards that comprehend how aggressively invasive and destructive these fuckers are.
I love the berries and I want all those ghetto neighborhood shanties to also know how much I love them.
Blackberries are not a crop you have to worry about leave gleanings for. They're maintenance free kosher plants.
Just cut and tarp. Don't worry, there's plenty left on any highway median.
I know they're big chonkers, but damn he must have been part deer too if he could chew on them without issue.
the vines are by no definition, razor sharp. they are more of a gripping thorn like a tiny rose thorn rather than a fuck off and die actually razor sharp opuntia thorn. If you have even the most mediocre of workgloves and a little dexterity, they are quite easy to pull out. their little chutes are connected so well to the mother plant that you can basically just yank entire canes and roots out when you pull on it. 
People need to quit bitching and moaning and just learn how to manage them. They are not a weed because no weed could possibly give the most delicious fruit; better than 99% of the nicest, fanciest produce department. It's a weed in the same way that a catfish is a pest.

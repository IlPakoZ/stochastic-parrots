/out/ings with a Pipe
Old thread: >>2536427
This is a thread for enjoying a pipe while doing outdoor activities. If you ask why this belongs on /out/, you've never spent an evening by the campfire with a /pipe/ silently enjoying the nature around you, and you're missing out.
how to get started
Purchase a Missouri Meerschaum Legend and a pouch of Half and Half or Captain Black tobacco, available at most smoke shops. You will need a lighter or match, and something to tamp it with--a large nail works well if you don't have a pipe tool. Fill the pipe with tobacco, pack it down halfway, top it off, pack it down to 3/4, top it off again, pack gently and enjoy. Smoke slower than you think you need to, the tobacco tastes best when it is burning cool. Tamp and re-light as needed. If you still have trouble, try different methods on YouTube until you find one that works for you.
smoking a pipe will give you cancer
While any tobacco consumption comes with some risk, the cancer risks from occasional pipe use are pretty minimal. Educate yourself and make your own informed health decisions.

Historical pipe enjoyer of the day: Elmer Keith. Avid outdoorsman and hunter throughout the 20th century, handloader and firearms enthusiast largely responsible for the creation of modern magnum handgun cartridges such as .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum
Biden administration gave me a free crack pipe and I love using it in the outdoors. I feel much more energetic and a love for life when I am on the trails. Even long trails go by so quickly and it's over before you know it.
Don't need to eat either and just sleep in the skin of the last thing you killed.
I was gifted half a dozen pipes from my grandfather, including one from my great grandfather. They are caked with ash and smell like death. How do I clean them and get them ready for use without damaging them? Most of them are wood.
Not bad! Out of curiosity, any brand names on them?
Best way to clean them is with alcohol. I use 100+ proof bourbon, some people use rum or brandy, even vodka is fine just make sure it's high proof. Soak the pipe cleaner in it then run it through the stem. As for the bowl, you can ream it out with sandpaper if the cake is too heavy or smells bad. Do it gently and evenly, and as little as possible. I tend not to ream out estate pipes and just clean it with an alcohol soaked rag unless they're really bad, but some people are weirded out by the idea of someone else's cake on their pipe.
Two of them are savory's argyll (top, pictured) Another is a medico ( not pictured.) Middle one in picture is BB something, cannot make it out. Bottom does not have a brand. 
Thanks for the advice.
I really love the almost flickering flame like pattern on the middle one. Happy smoking!
Do you know what tobacco your grandfather smoked? Some flavors imprint more strongly than others
Got my first new pipe about an hour ago, before this I only had one from an antique store. Anyone have things to say about Dr. Grabow? 
I plan to primarily use this for herbal smoking (mugwort, for example) but sometimes weed. It’s got a 6mm filter in the stem.
Totally solid basic tier briars. Honestly my Dr. G gets more exercise than my nicer pipe just because I'm not afraid to take it /out/ where it might get damaged.
I wouldn't waste a briar by smoking weed out of it. The bowl geometry is optimized for tobacco. You'll have an unsatisfactory smoking experience and leave all kinds of ghost flavors in the bowl that you do not want when you do use it for tobacco later. If that's your nicest pipe I would save it for just tobacco and smoke weed and herbals out of other shittier pipes. Honestly you won't notice a difference in smoking experience if you used a corncob instead for those things.
Pipe cleaners and alcohol. 
I use both bristled and plain pipe cleaners and 91% isopropyl alcohol. Works like a charm You can get iso91 at any drugstore or even Walmart for $3. Dip the pipe cleaners in the alcohol and run it through the nasty airway of your mouthpiece and pipe shank. The trash WILL come out. Alternate between wet and dry cleaners. When a wet pipe cleaners comes out clean, you are done. Let it dry out for a few hours and then get smoking. 
As for the bowls, you want the caked-on ash to be no thicker than the thickness of a dime. Some people even go back down to bare wood. There are reamers you can use, but you can use a knife blade too. Back in the day, the round-ended knife blade of the old Trim Trio keychain tool was just about ideal for the job-perfect shape, perfect length. You can use a regular pocketknife too, just don’t let the tip of the knife blade gouge the bottom of your bowl.
I threw away my shitty cob pipe last week after noticing how adicted I had become. I had slowly started smoking more and more, going from smoking one 50g pouch every 3 months or so to smoking a pouch within 2 weeks. 
I might wanna give pipe smoking a new try if I manage to get my hands on a brair burl to make a proper pipe for myself.
It's not good for everyone. Props to you for recognizing that it was becoming a problem and throwing the pipe away. Honestly one 50g pouch every 2 weeks isn't that much of a habit, but if you noticed you were craving it or having to smoke every day you definitely made the right decision. Most people don't notice the addiction creeping up on them until they're pack-a-day cigarette smokers.
smoking with my cob maybe once or twice a week maximum
bowl gets hot, goes out multiple times in a row, top layer of tobacco burns to white ash, bottom layer of tobacco is unburnt, smoke tastes terribly like burnt wood after a while
if I empty the pipe and clean it it looks undamaged and unburnt inside
It didn't do that in the beginning and I have no idea what's going on. Is this normal?
It’s normal. To fully char the inside, don’t pack at all, just gravity fill your pipe, then smoke it all the way down. Including the lady few puffs when it tastes really weird. That weird taste will be the stem charring, and once it’s done, you’ll be good for the rest of time with that pipe. .
Another option is to remove the part of the shank that extends into the bottom of the bowl completely and fill in the bottom with pipe mud. That wooden shank bit tastes like shit until it is completely charred up. Removing it also gives you a bit more room. I just got a new cob that I'm going to do this to.

Are you lightly tamping occasionally while you smoke? Sometimes you gotta help the embers work their way down. Also look up Muttonchop’s videos in packing and smoking cadence. If you don’t have success after perfecting your technique then your tobacco might be old/too dry (burns hot on the top then runs out of fuel and burns out). Also, what’s the make of your cob? Most pipes smoke good but there’s some sketchy, cheap Chinese stuff on Amazon. If you have one of those that could be a problem. When I started years ago I didn’t know any better and bought some cheapos that delaminated and fell apart after one smoke. Tasted horrible.
Post your pipe collections lads. What should I get next? I kinda want something in that old Custom Bilt style or maybe a meerschaum, or something charismatic like a calabash. Can’t decide where to go next. Too many options.
Honestly one 50g pouch every 2 weeks isn't that much of a habit, but if you noticed you were craving it or having to smoke every day you definitely made the right decision.
Yeah I definitely started noticing this problem at college. I'd be sitting at my laptop in the library but feel the craving creep up on me till I'd just head on home to sit in the backyard and smoke for a while. It also doesn't help the cravings to smoke become insane when I drink, which is too often. Biggest reason for quitting was the price of tobacco, a 50g pouch of nice pipe tobacco is almost 20€. I was almost spending more in a month than my chain smoker friend who only smokes rollies to keep down costs.
I am reassured.
The stem is indeed a bit blackened and worn around the edges now that I look at it in bright daylight. It's a Meerschaum cob with some Seven Seas tobacco that isn't that dry, so I'll just keep smoking it.
Thanks for the support. gents.
How do I keep the fucker lit? I have a Missouri Meerschaum and a Dr. Grabow. I forget what tobacco I have (it's pretty old bit but been sealed in a plastic nag in a mason jar for 3 years). Even when it was new, or with other tobacco, I could never keep it lit well. I fill like the OP says, usually. The stuff I have right now is in little coin/coil shapes, and I've seen different techniques for smoking those that I've tried, but nother works for me. Any tips on getting a consistent pack/burn?
If you have flakes or coins, you’re gonna need to pack it a different way.
let it dry for about 15-20 minutes
fully rub it out, making sure it’s thin and not chunky
let it dry for another 15-20 minutes
gravity fill your pipe to the top, basically just drop the tobacco into your pipe and tapping the pipe bowl to make sure the tobacco goes down
gently put any hanging tobacco into the bowl without pushing down
get a pinch of tobacco and gently use the meat of your thumbs to stuff it in your pipe, making sure not to push down into the bowl
That should do it. You’ll always want to pack flakes, coins, cakes, and plugs looser because they are dense. They’ll expand in your pipe, and your pipe will keep going out because of that. You’ll also get a better flavor as well. While smoking a flake/coin, if it does go out, try to relight first and really try to not tamp unless you absolutely have to. I’m usually able to relight 3 or 4 times before I absolutely have to tamp.
They’ll expand in your pipe, and your pipe will keep going out because of that.
Meant to say it’ll keep going out if you pack it right, due to it expanding.
FUCK! *if you pack it tight
Usually issues keeping it lit come down to one of two things:
Tobacco is either too dry, or too moist
You are not packing and tamping correctly
Common mistake is to not tamp often enough. If your draw is starting to get too easy and the smoke is getting thin, tamp it down. If you've been having trouble with other tobaccos too, try getting the hang of it with normal tobacco before you start using those coin shapes. Go buy a fresh pack of Half and Half or something and practice with that.
Use your draw to tell you what you need to do. Same thing with packing the pipe--I don't use any specific "method" for how to fill the bowl, I just pack more in until the draw feels right and I usually get pretty good results. Err on the side of too little tobacco until you have a feel for it. Too little tobacco just means shorter smoking session, but if you cram in too much, it will not stay lit properly.
Looks like I'm not the only one who likes my pipe with a glass of whiskey or 3 at night!
pipe filters y/n?
Thanks guys. Ill give this advice a shot. And when you say rub it out, you mean break up the coin, right? Like so that it looks like regular pouch tobacco? 
When I first looked into this, I found someone on youtube recommend to just fold, ball up and twist a coin, put it in the pipe and pack it down just a little, then ball up another one and put it on top, packing just till its even with the bowl. Honestly, that worked the best for me, but still not great. Hearing that I need to pack looser helps to, I'll give that a shot. Thanks
And when you say rub it out, you mean break up the coin, right? Like so that it looks like regular pouch tobacco?
Yes. I’ve personally never got the fold and stuff method to work for me, though if you find it works for you, try that out but integrate the drying time and loose packing.
Might help with tongue bite but I just learn to smoke differently with each tobacco.
Personal preference, really. I feel like I get a fuller flavor without it, but I know some people like a lighter flavor. They do help with moisture though.
managed to block the stem of my pipe the other day, serves me right for using cheap pipe cleaners i guess. it's a bent stem mm cob. any recommendations on how to clear it or should i just chuck it and buy another? it is a cob after all.
Like a piece of the pipe cleaner broke off in the stem? Use a piece of wire to dislodge it. Get some mechanics wire from the hardware store, it's really useful to carry with you /out/ as well as just for this one task
I usually forgo them, I feel like they kind of mess with the airflow and make eveything feel a bit unnatural.
No but personally I add a few Nording Keystones to the bottom of my bowls to help a bit with the moisture and it helps me smoke all of the tobacco down to pure ash since there is a little void underneath of it. No dottle at all, ever. All ash. I use them in all of my pipes, even cobs. Just put a few at the bottom.
Have you tried the actual Nording pipe like pictured on the bag? Any good? I've been thinking about getting one
I'm a little curious, how does everyone hold their pipes?
Lips? Bit between teeth? How far back?
I used to hold it just behind the canines but after clattering my jaw a few weeks ago I just can't find a comfortable bite.
Start with just 1 coin. Rub it between your hands until it breaks up, then fill your pipe loosely. If your pipe is not full, rub out a second coin, but do not “pack” your pipe. Just fill it loosely, light it, and tamp lightly as needed when the smoke starts to thin out. 
Don’t like them. After trying them, it’s like fucking through a shower curtain.
unironically get the little rubber thingies, they make the stem grippy so you don't have to bite down to keep the pipe stable.
Fill them with coarse salt, let it sit 3 days, empty salt, reload with salt. Repeat until salt remaons white after 3 days. Then clean with isopropyl alcohol and probably adjust the caking with a tool.
so got it apart and cleared the blockage. turns out it was a filter that i'd managed to destroy while trying to clean the pipe, and then absolutely fucking mangle when trying to remove the blockage. there's a lot more flow through the pipe with the filter gone than there was before so i assume it's probably a bad idea to smoke without one given i was already burning my tongue before.
If you were burning your tongue, you were smoking too hot and dry. Unrelated issue. Restricting the flow can help prevent tongue bite, but it's a crutch, not the actual solution. Smoke slower, puff less frequently, tamp more often, make sure your tobacco isn't all dried out before you start.
Tongue burn is caused by too damp tobacco developing hot steam instead of smoke and burning your tongue
hot steam
almost always false. tongue burn is usually a chemical burn.
I dont believe that to be the case. Very few pipe tobacco has enough nicotine to cause a chemical burn by saturation through too fast combustion. Yet, tongue burn is universally experienced by virtually all pipe smokers at least once. Then they dry the tobacco a bit and the problem seems solved until a new can surprizes you with its moisture content once again.
Never realized that where tongue bite or burn comes from was a controversial subject. It can probably be from all of the above, all I can say is that in my personal experience when I'm smoking and get a stinging or burning sensation on my tongue, it's because either I was trying to smoke dried out tobacco, or I was smoking too hot and puffing too often. Usually if I let the pipe cool a little the burn goes away, unless I'm knowingly smoking really dry old tobacco which I try not to do anymore.
It's not the nicotine that causes the chemical burn.
Imo that is becaue the dried out tobacco isnt as much dried out as you think it is, yet the outside of pieces of tobacco might be dry enough and combust violent enough to convert the moisture from the inside into steam real fast compared to evenly damp tobacco pieces. There really is more moisture in pipe tobacco that should be, but that is how you make the beginning and end of a tin a relatively consistent experience. However, from tobacco like hh rustica is indeed very much capable of causing a chemical burn with too much nicotine released into the smoke by hard and fast puffs.
Then what
probably various bases. the mouth is pretty resistant to acids, but quite vulnerable to bases, and even a mild base that has been heated will be quite aggressive. if you smoke too hot you tend to get an immediate nip and back off and you're fine, no damage done - there is far less thermal capacity in a few puffs than even a tiny sip of coffee. and the nip gives you immediate feedback so you can correct your puffing speed or put down the pipe for a few minutes to cool. but chemical burns are sneaky, they take a while to take effect, you may start to feel it partway through the bowl, but it continues to get worse for hours or even a day after you've finished the bowl, so there's no feedback, and not much imo that you can do to correct it, there are tobaccos that bite me no matter how slowly I go, and after 30 years of pipe smoking I can go extremely slowly indeed. i even built a rig to test this theory about heat, it was a jar with a hole in the top to fit a meerschaum coloring bowl, a hole for a temperature probe, and a hookah hose to smoke it with - so basically a fuckhuge expansion chamber. smoked a bowl of mcclelland's red virginia with it and burned my mouth anyway, temperature probe never got above 115F.
you may start to feel it partway through the bowl, but it continues to get worse for hours or even a day after you've finished the bowl
In that case i never experienced tongue burn, so my opinion on is is meaningless apparently.
30 years of pipe smoking
Based inquisitive grandpa if you're not a liar, and that's a cool experiment. Sounds like there are several different unpleasant sensations that have different causes but get lumped together as "tongue bite" by most smokers.
I see where the idea about nicotine comes from, I definitely get a prickling or stinging sensation with some tobaccos that have a high N content, Haunted Bookshop is a good example. I can't prove that it's the nicotine causing it, but in my limited experience it seems to correlate with how much nicotine is in the blend.
Is it normal to lose the desire to smoke? 
The other day I couldn't bring myself to take more than a couple puffs. It was a nice day and I had free time but I couldn't bring myself to take more than a couple puffs.
I occasionally go a week or more without a puff. I guess that means I'm not addicted. Also I tend to flip between 99% pipe and 99% cigar every now and then. For the last 3 years I've been almost entirely a pipe smoker (probably &lt; a dozen cigars), then about two months ago I flipped to cigars for some reason and have only had one bowl in my pipe since then. The pisser is I had just opened a late-80's tin of Red Rapparee, I'm gonna have to vacuum seal it again and hope it holds until I get back to pipes.
What movie is that clip from Anon? It looks interesting!
How do you get flavor out of a flake?
I have a tin of Capstan but the flavor just doesn't want to come out.
I jist finished a tin. Its the mildest pipe tobacco i ever had, im wondering about the flavor myself.
Smoking shouldn't be a chore. Did you not enjoy the taste of the tobacco?
Smoking comes with health consequences (pretty minor if you smoke in moderation, but still) and we only do it because it's so enjoyable to do. If it's not enjoyable for you anymore, no reason to keep doing it. Though if you want to rediscover the pleasure you had from it initially I would try some different types of tobacco. Try exploring a whole new category of tobacco that you're not used to--if you mostly smoke aromatics, try an English, or the other way around. I recently got some Bayou Morning to switch things up and found myself really getting into it.
Capstan Blue does not have a particularly strong taste, just a mild bready flavor. Capstan Yellow has even less taste, if you can believe it. These were both OTC blends back in the day, designed for people who chain-smoked their pipes, in which situation a surplus of flavor is actually a negative as it can overload the taste buds and you get sick of the taste. Not good for profits.
I think it's because I fucked up my cob by using a little bit of soap to try to get rid of a bad ghost. Because the same tobacco I had no issues smoking in my other pipe the day after Easter. Other possibility is allergies making it a little harder to breath combined with some other stress.
I have been smoking mostly aros so I might try to find a nice VaPer but I'll have to get it online since all the local smoke shops are overpriced cigars or weed/vape/hookah
soap
on a cob
your cob is now a dedicated erinmore pipe, and there is nothing now to do but toss it and buy a new pipe.
using soap on a pipe
you packed it too much
Do any of you guys actually smoke pipes while camping? Tried it and it was a pita, I will be sticking to cigars. I like to smoke during brief breaks during a hike and trying to fuck with a pipe is just too much. Cigars you just light-and-go, no fuss. The pipe is great far superior while reading though bc I can set it down without burning shit or having somewhere to set it.
Maybe I'm just not set up right? Explain how you'd smoke during a 10-15 minute break to eat, refill water, or rest.
brief breaks
Well there's your problem. I smoke when I'm relaxing. Can't have a relaxing smoke if you're trying to beat the clock.
You smoke at the end of the day when you're relaxing you fucking smoothbrain. What kind of camping are you doing that you don't have a couple hours here and there just relaxing around camp? Sitting around with a line in the water or around a fire having a drink with your friends? Those are the times when you bring out the pipe. Your argument only makes sense if you're just doing hike, eat, sleep, hike, eat, sleep with no time for anything else, and why the fuck would you do that?
I also enjoy smoking while I'm hiking as long as it's not too strenuous, clenching the pipe or carrying it in one hand, but that's not for everyone.
At least you didn't do that to a briar. Lesson learned, dumbass. You don't clean a pipe with soap. Try using high proof bourbon. Throw that cob away and buy another one.
Comfy! Location? Baccy?
If you don’t feel like smoking, don’t force yourself to smoke. It’s meant for you to enjoy, and if you’re not enjoying it you shouldn’t do it. Sometimes I’ll go a couple weeks without smoking if it’s just not appealing to me. I’d recommend taking a break for a week or two. It frees up time for you to do other stuff, and when you do come back to smoking you’ll find that it’s even more enjoyable than you remember.
This is, by a landslide, the best thread I’ve ever seen on 4chan.
This isn't that great as /pipe/ threads go honestly. Used to be a little more active and a few threads back we had a couple anons who were trying to grow and cure their own tobacco and posting about the process. I don't think it went great but it was still really cool that they tried
Getting ready for summer lads. Any of you remember when C&amp;D dropped Sunbear last year? I missed out and would like to snag a few tins this year based on the good things I've heard.
Mac Baren vanilla cake on my birthday with some Roger Miller tunes for company
Damn phone put the picture fuckin sideways
After drying it for over an hour and fully rubbing it out I finally had a bowl of Samuel Gawith FVF that stayed lit well today.
Good times.
Damn thats cheap
There's some people who say that you should never clean a briar pipe too throughly and that said caking is desireable. In that case, its probably better to clean it because it might have mold or other nastyness in them, but there's that.
Is this a good book to /out/ with a pipe? Should I start smoking? Ive never smoked before because my mom kept telling me to never do it since i was 5
Any book goes well with a good churchwarden.
Should I start smoking
Its not great for you, but a pipe a few times a week CAN add some benefits. Slows you down, makes you aware of your breathing, gives you a chance to reflect, and introduces you to the intricate details of the hobby. For example, do you want to jump in, smoke a bunch of types of tobacco, and start learning with a corncob, or do you want to really research a good briar and pick a tobacco to match? Either way is fine. Both choices can be done at once. Just make sure you learn from the geezers on the forums, cause they're pretty wise and can save you a lot of struggle with the hobby. 
The book itself is good. I'm not a Tolkien fanatic, but I read and enjoyed the hobbit. Never cared for him as a writer. Lacked a certain quotability in his prose, but i was an English majoe, so take from that what you will. Smoking a pipe for me came down to the reflective, often outdoorsy nature of it, and it got me to step away from the lame, expensive vapes I was buying. Think of it as like giving up the alcoholic gas station slurpees for a shot at bourbon tasting. One is cheap, easy, and potentially dangerous. The other is refined, its pleasure derived from the discipline and familiarity with the products in hand. Of course, don't lean too far into that side of things. It's all just leaves getting smoked in a wooden bowl, after all.
I haven't read a book since middle school(midsummer nights dream)
Sell me on this book
Yeah I exclusively buy from America now because of the prices. Even with expensive shipping it works out at around £13 a tin whereas in the UK it's now around £20 minimum. Just got to have good luck with customs.
I'm pretty sure nobody reads tolkien for his prose but for his worldbuilding. For prose, you read Wodehouse.
should I start smoking
Weigh the health risks for yourself. If you have an addictive personality or struggle with addiction to alcohol or other substances, absolutely don't do it. But it can be very enjoyable, gives you something to do with your hands and another kind of sensory stimulus to go along with walking in the woods or sitting by the fire and talking
start with Tolkein
It's a classic and yes I recommend it. Really conveys the comfy atmosphere of wandering and exploring the outdoors encountering wonderful things that is at the heart of what we do here, though as >>2575009 and others pointed out he gets a little over hyped in pop culture. But if you're asking that question you're clearly not a lit snob, prose will probably be way better than anything you're used to and you'll have a good time. If some of the writing seems quaint and archaic to you remember that it was published like 90 years ago. If you enjoy it and want to get more into /lit/ snob tier fantasy try Gene Wolfe
This is the pipe to smoke while reading this
gene wolfe is an odd recommendation he doesn't really do that kind of nature writing
I just meant if you want Tolkein esque elegant, beautifully written prose but even more so, in a fantasy setting, Gene Wolfe's my recommendation. You're right that it's not as explicitly /out/ type of content, though I really enjoy anything in that broader genre of people journeying through a fantastical setting and having strange adventures to read and smoke while I'm outdoors, even if the adventures I'm having are a little pathetic by comparison it still puts me in the right mindset
I'm amazed that works out cheaper but then I hadn't realised how cheap tobacco was in the US. Where do you order from? How often has customs got hold of your orders and what charges do they slap on top when they do?
Where do you order from?
4noggins is the place to order from as they just don't care and mark the box as hobby supplies in order to dodge customs. You gets some real fags like smokingpipes who deliberately tell customs what's in the box so you're almost guaranteed to get hit.
How often has customs got hold of your orders and what charges do they slap on top when they do?
Hasn't happened to me yet because I've only made a few orders from the US. If they do catch you, the charges are pretty steep. It's £161.62 per kg so for my order I will be paying around £40 on top. 
There are tricks to minimise the risk though. Keeping your order small (around 4 tines) and ordering through 4nogs has kept me out of the woods so far.
Thanks for the tips, I'll give it a go. It's ridiculous that shipping stuff halfway around the world is cheaper than buying local
£161.62 per kg
Is that the customs tax?
Yes. It's ridiculously large

You morons made me buy a beginner pipe set. Can't wait to try it.
Holy shit man. I thought i had it bad.
Keep at it, its an art you need to learn. Takes years to perfect it.
FVF is one of the hardest tobaccos to prepare properly. It took me well over a dozen bowls to finally get it right. Definitely an accomplishment lol
What does Sam Hyde smoke? I’ve seen him talking about C&amp;D Autumn Evening and Apricots &amp; Cream and how good they are. I feel like he’s a burley guy at heart though.
Did you settle on a certain drying time and way to prepare the flake?
I'm gonna try an hour+ of drying with twist and fold and cutting it into cubes too.
In an old vid with Charls he smokes Davidoff English mixture and some Royal Yacht. I'd also like to know what he regularly smokes nowadays though.

I ordered a pipe online and when it got delivered my mom opened it and started crying she smashed the thing what do I do now? I really want to start smoking I've never done any nicotine before.
Dont live with your mum or alternarively break her arm for opening a letter thats not for her.
Buy it at a tobacco store, and if you can't because of your age, then don't.

I'm a neet who can't really get to a store so this is my only option
Well, sucks to be you, i guess.
Then the last thing you need is something that costs money and can make you addicted.
Fix your life first.
What >>2576275 said. Taking up smoking can be a reward for when you get a damn job and move out of your parents' house.
I know costs of living are high right now and it can be difficult. Best bet is probably to find several roommates to rent a whole house or duplex or something. Mobile homes are also an underrated option because of the stigma, being trailer trash is not so bad and it's an economical option. Some people are making it work living in an extended family situation in one house like third worldfags do, but if your mom is crying and smashing your packages that is clearly not a good option for you.
When I was about 8 years old, every holiday we used to go to a hotel by the beach, and in two or three different seasons there was this same couple that would sit on the patio of the hotel drinking mate and the old man would smoke a pipe. It was the first time I saw a guy smoking tobacco that wasn't from cigarettes. It marked me deeply, I loved the image and smell, and ever since then I was very excited to try pipe tobacco and cigars, when I found out about them later on.
Fast forward to when I was 18, still living with my parents, I just went ahead and told them I have wanted to try tobacco for a while and was about to do so. I was still living with my parents but waited until I got a job. My parents always hated any kind of tobacco so making them buy it for me was simply ridiculous.
I just sat down with them and talked to them about it, told them the truth. I found cigarettes digusting but pipe tobacco and good cigars are nothing like cigarettes at all, you don't inhale them, it's virtually impossible to get addicted to them if you smoke them occasionally, etc etc etc.
They still hate tobacco of any form but they accepted that I enjoy it, and out of respect for them I smoke either when I'm /out/ or when they are out of the house.
There is no other way around it, she shouldn't have opened your package but on the other hand it's her house and she's paying for it, you have to respect it, so just try to level with her and she still doesn't accept it, well, not so comfy being a neet now is it?
I do an hour of drying the flake, then I rub it out, then I let it dry for another 30-45 minutes.
been rolling pipe tobacco.
I smoke majoritarily cigars, when I tried smoking a pipe but the whole ritual wasn't for me. The thing is, I loved the tobacco itself, Artisan Blend. 
The tin was sitting for a few months when I thought about it and tried rolling it and the experience was actually quite nice, just have to let the tobacco drier than it would be for a pipe.
It's a great alternative to cigars since premium pipe tobacco is much cheaper than even mediocre cigars, plus there is a great variety of pipe tobacco.
Thinking about getting a tin of Elizabethan Mixture, my first VaPer.
Haven't tried Elizabethan myself but I've heard great things about it. My favourite VaPer is Escudo, that stuff is so smooth and delicious it's incredible.

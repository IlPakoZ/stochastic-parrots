this is /out/, not /pol/
Not gonna click on jewtube + communism is awesome!1!1
because actual oregon is a shithole.
I miss when youtube showed the thumbs down counts, you could estimate the quality of the video before watching it.
No direct flights from where I live and nearly 3,000 miles away so it's kinda far down the list
Does the coast count?
there a browser extension to show them
Because I already live in /out/ Oregon.
wrong. its literally the best state. no sales tax. high desert, temperate rainforest, costal dunes, juniper woodlands, steppe, and alpine. the state has a very large percentage of publicly accessible land.
mt hood national forest
Columbia gorge national scenic area
it's a shit hole son.
I’ve only done one destination hike by flying rather than driving, and it was in Oregon. 
Other than the flight, it’s about three hours of travel, including a quick stop in Portland to buy stove fuel, so basically an entire day just to get there. There are private shuttles straight there, but you’re only saving maybe an hour of time and they’re crazy expensive. 
I want to do a trip to Bend, than a bus to Sisters to hike the Three Sisters Loop, but I’m afraid of hitch hiking (less being murdered and more just not being picked up). I might just do a private shuttle, but I don’t know. It’s been a few years because Oregon was retarded with Covid restrictions.
He gave examples of why it’s not a shithole, specifically environmental diversity. Can you explain why he’s wrong and why Oregon is bad? Use your words.
bump for based
GO BACK TO CALIFORNIA
Oregon is truly a fucking shithole and you honestly shouldn’t even bother.
CA has way more diversity and tons of outdoor stuff.
OP can't inb4 faggot-to-the-max
But I have. 
This is correct.
bro stfu
Kek remind me what your income tax is again?
Dear Mr. Putin,
When you nuke the U.S. please make sure you annihilate Portland, Salem, Eugene, Corvallis, Bend, and Ashland. 
Thank you in advance, and godspeed.
Dear God,
Please smite all the pot growers in Oregon. Also, could you please make another Hell but with 10x more red hot poker in the ass for them? 
Thank you and God bless.
You've been there?
Oregon>any red state
Commie scum
NTA but I have. I can confirm.
I will once I buy my mags
Oregon is a red state.
Pdx/salem/Eugene aren’t Oregon.
Trump won Marion County (Salem) in 2016. Clinton won Lane County (Eugene) with 56%. Multi mag County always surprised me, because I thought let it would have been Clinton with at least 85% (it was 73%, which is a landslide still, but I expected worse).
Your phones autocorrect is taunting us isn’t it?
Browser extension is called "Return Youtube Dislikes"
Yeah it's a red state that is why they pass the most severe gun laws in the country.
At least be honest with yourself. It's a beautiful state that is going to continue increasingly be dominated by Portland's absurd politics.
Portland passed that. Again, Oregon is a red state without the people’s republic of Portland.
But you’re right; greater Idaho needs to happen.
Marion County is about 50/50 conservative/liberal scum, but it's a shit place for outdoor stuff anyway, as is the whole Willamette Valley. You find yourself hunting nutria and wonder where you went wrong. You seem to think Oregon might someday lean more conservative but it won't. The election process is rigged to hell in favor of communism.
It ain't just Portland, bubba. There's as many biden voting fucktards in the rest of the state as there are in pdx. Hell, La Grande and Burns have a lot of commies.
Keep holding your breath. State of Jefferson has a better chance of happening. I have no skin in the game because I left years ago when it became obvious what was happening. Just be realistic about things - you look like a goof when you start talking about Hail Mary's like redrawing state lines or creating new states to escape the inevitable.
i have, it was awesome
lmao what a disaster this site has endured
just did a Roadtrip around washington state, did a few days in the oregon and it was pretty tight. posting some pics
First time in scrublands and really liked it. except for the ticks.
it got windy af but was really nice after 3 days on rain on the coast and portland
view from inside the tent from the edge of the Deschutes river. 10/10 would recommend. 11/10 with fishing rod
it would be bragging to list out all the awesome outdoor stuff within walking/biking distance, let alone under 1 hour of driving
but alas, it doesn't make up for the progressives hell bent on ruining the state.
you sound like a fag
Which is it?
stop stereotyping me because i live in oregon, you filthy suburbanite.
oregon is great
the willamette valley is also great
however, roughly 70% of the people are trash.
You dumb motherfucker, I put 250,000 miles on my truck exploring Oregon. I hunted, fished, hiked, and camped in Oregon for 28 years and I've seen more of Oregon than you'll ever dream about. I can tell you more about the Willamette Valley than your atrophied brain can absorb, ya fuckin toolbag.
Why would you explore the Willamette valley when “the whole Willamette Valley is a shit place for outdoor stuff?” Sounds like a waste of time.
The legacy of your entire generation
Perhaps he formulated such an opinion after exploring the willamette valley in it's entirety?
State of jefferson head kneeled to state of greater idaho for having a higher likelihood.
Oregon would just need votes from governor, state, federal and president.
Only way jefferson forms is if california and oregon seceded and we get a west virginia situation in which case youd see greater idaho anyways.
In greater idaho vote, every county west of klamath voted against speaking of greater idaho. Too many cali retirement boomers unable to let go.
What will be the legacy of yours, you filthy little cunt.
I know it’s pathetically weak bait by a brain dead zoomie, but being alive at the same time as politicians and their unelected appointees doesn’t make one responsible for their fuckups/malice.
LMAO yeah you only need the governor (who doesn't approve), the state (who doesn't approve), the federal government (who doesn't care/doesn't approve) and the president (who doesn't care/doesn't approve) and it's a win!!
What a fucking goofball.
Our legacy will be death and chaos 
For that is all that is left to us
I hope the cancer is particularly painful faggot.
Stay mad zoomie :)
Imagine being this emotional. Are you ok, or are you a woman?
i have but i live in nh so it's not the easiest place to visit on a whim
my second favorite after nm
I think you know the answer to this.

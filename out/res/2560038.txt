I know there is at six other people on this board with $4,300
That looks like a barren desert. Is there ground water available? Otherwise you're gonna be stuck trucking in water and that's expensive. Codyslab is in Colorado and they have to buy water to raise their cattle.
btw this looks boring asf what will do there rocket science?
Realistically the only productive use of such land is ranching, but you need water for that. I suppose you could try goats instead of cattle to minimize water cost but goat meat has a much lower demand in America.
Never heard "it's cheap for a reason", huh?
Drive 10 minutes to the mountain range and thousands of acres of national forest land?
What’s with you guys and thinking you need to build some kind of self sufficient farm there?
Honestly I would just build a barn to store some toys for hunting and recreation, with a loft for sleeping, and treat it like a cheap vacation house and use it as a jumping off point for trips around the state.
Trailering/driving a jeep on 37’s for over 10 hours sucks, so it would be great to leave it there all summer and have basically a free hotel room. 
Renting out the loft as a cheap air b&amp;b a dozen weekends a year would pay the taxes and little water needed for showers and drinking
Renting out the loft as a cheap air b&amp;b
Not a bad idea. With a good gimmick and the right marketing you might do well with this. Maybe put up a movie-set style "old west town" and make a Westworld experience?
Where?
Idk about that, the point would be a simple and cheap place where a family can sleep and eat at for a night or two while they travel the state enjoying nature, or a weekend base camp for hunters with a nice area to come back and butcher their game.
Trying to build out some form of entertainment there on the property would be counter productive
Where's the trees? The rivers? The proper meat?
bet you could do better in Moffat County
What exactly are going to do with 30 acres steppe? Graze 3 cows?
Ranching if* the water is readily accessible and cheap. And by readily accessible I mean able to be irrigated with a ditch and not high pressure water equipment, because that would hike the cost. Given that this is a 35 acre lot with no cattle already on it, it's probably safe to assume it's not feasible.
OP implied it would be split into 5 acre lots
What are you going to do with five acres of steppe? Graze three goats?
Probably would at least be $60k to install power, septic and a well. Jannies would report you if you're living there without septic.
He's in Utah. His family's ranch is actually just 30 minutes from my house
Jannies would report you if you're living there without septic.
Is this the gayest shit on the planet? I had some faggot report my house to the city board because I didn't have flood vents on my bottom floor in an area that floods. They should've told me who the fuck did it so I could give his house a fucking inspection. Ass licking queer.
Build a barn to store stuff with a loft for sleeping and eating.
Treat it as a base for hunting or vacations, and rent the loft out a dozen weekends a year to pay the taxes and water.
Septic is like 7k and solar isn’t much more.
Don’t need a well if you aren’t living there permanently or raising livestock.
Taking my post from the other 1000 dollar an acre thread. land is cheap for a reason, mainly because its pretty much impossible to live there off grid.
I've done the math on this and am actively planning to live the /out/ escapist LARP. 600,000 USD is the number. You're going to pay way more 1000 an acre for land that you can homestead with. Way more.
40 acres of land thats a combo of trees, water, flatland for buildings above floodzones, and grazing pasture. Acquired for 320,000 in 2020. It has a cabin, well, outhouse and I've added makeshift solar. Eventually I'll need to build roads in, build a barn, and build some kind of 4 season structure with real bathrooms, septic, a real solar battery setup or run grid power to it. That shit adds up very quickly.
Good news, land and home prices are going to drop like a rock in the coming months so if you've been saving your sheckles you'll have an opportunity coming up.
This works and is a great plan until the first crackhead breaks in and steals all your stuff. Then it goes from 100% quality thinking to 100% shit idea in the span of a day.
Leaving stuff alone in the desert is tough. If you had tree cover it'd be a different story, but anyone will be able to spot and monitor your pad from miles away.
This risk would be offset by the 35 acre property being split with six others who also come and go as they please, meaning the area would most likely be occupied by at least one person for the majority of the time.
I think regular traffic to the area, coupled with the remoteness of it would make for extremely low risk of such a thing.
You’re right if it was just one person on that whole 35 acres tho, it would be dumb to leave too much stuff there year round.
and there's ~1000 people that visit this board every day with half a million dollars to spend for fun. It's an absolute shithole with no prospects
Colarado
Yikes
This works and is a great plan until the first crackhead breaks in and steals all your stuff
the crackhead that you can spot 10 miles out
I inherited close to a million and a half when my mom's cousin, who I helped build heli skiing Resort in British Columbia died. So now I'm going to pay off my house and possibly by the next door one so I can put duplexes on the back and ride the property train to 5 million dollars
Where in the fuck is that, Alamosa?
Map coords would be useful. Looks like a river behind it in pic. Problem is that road doesnt connect to the property. Is there access to the property?
aint a god damn thing on that 35 acres of dust and probably nuclear waste that makes it worth more than .5 acres of old mixed forest in a temperate or tropic zone
1k an acre isn't cheap.
$1k and acre is super cheap. Have you never heard that you should never build on land less valuable than the structure you’re building?
fuckers do this because they are selfish fucks thinking theres a minor chance you will just fuck off and move away leaving them to be the only person in the area. super common in recreational cabins in canada. some youtuber got in some massive legal battle with his neighbor about some petty ass shit like this. this society is full of neurotic boomer fucks that slave away their entire life for shit like this and when they realize its just not going be them alone in paradise they have a spastic fit and start finding ways to drive people out.
Probably in the valley somewhere. Aka tweekerland. Nope.avi op
Crackheads roam, it's part of what makes them a pestilence.
hes in utah and they have rainwater collection
splitting it between 6 other people
Hell I'm one of most poor people alive.
But I've been saving money for like 15+ years.
I got at least 15,000.
So I want 51%.
Now all we need is some people to work on
Farm food
Water pipe system
Wood/stone house building 
electric wires for electricity
solar panels/wind turbines (electric windmill) for power.
A filter sysyem for the water.
Transportation routes to other cities
Such as roads, or plane landing spots.
Some people to manage deals with other cities where we trade food? for other junk?
I guess we could breed sheep for cotten, and cows for meat and leather. And other animals for resources.
Other stuff?
Now you might say since I own 51% I should do all that.
But screw you, I will sit on my ass and eat and drink all the time.
I'll be the top 1% spoiled guy, and people can hate me for it.
Living the dream.
But you guys can vote on town name.
Have you never heard that you should never build on land less valuable than the structure you’re building?
not sure if sarcastic or stupid. i'd guess 99% of all dwelling in the US violate this.
OP please use the MGTOW general for these southern colorado land deals 
you WILL remain completely vigilant with your head on a swivel 24/7/365
nah, they'd wait til they see there's no cars, lights out, or otherwise strike at the strangest time of night. if you lived out in the boonies you'd understand that's how they operate.
but OP, that land is utterly useless. having more of it does nothing for you. might as well get an equally useless, but smaller plot of land that you can afford yourself.
first plot of land: 59k
house construction costs: 128k
site dev/well: 55k
final valuation: ~650ish
i think you might have misinterpreted what that adage was trying to say anon.
that math dont work
Worked pretty well for me.
read this Anon
You know what's crazy to me, is how government uses Satellites and shit, to see if people are living on free open land.
And then send cars with rangers/officials to charge money or move the people.
But I just want to live in the open land, miles away from towns for free.
What happened to land of the free?
Ive been there its just trailers and weed growers and dust. You get what you oay for
Already been done. https://coloradosun.com/2022/02/08/black-hammer-utopia-norwood-colorado/
A Black separatist group’s utopian dream for land near Telluride withered after an armed standoff 
The Black Hammer group had $100,000 and a real estate contract for 40 acres where they planned a settlement free of cops, COVID and white people
segregation is okay when we do it
can this clown world bullshit die off already? fucks sake.
whoops, forgot pic
Sorry anon. I'm staying in Pennsylvania where I have claim since my paternal line were founders
thanks

might as well get an equally useless, but smaller plot of land that you can afford yourself.
I would if I could find this kind of scrub land sold in 5 acre or smaller plots.
Everything that’s like 3 acres is closer to cities and actually more expensive than the full 35 acres of scrub
I don’t wanna start a community, I don’t wanna try to homestead scrub land, and I don’t wanna live there year round.
What I really want is 3-5 acres of cheap scrubland to put a barn on and use as a base for hunting and camping trips around the state.
And then send cars with rangers/officials to charge money
this has never once happened
What's your mortgage rate? Is it fixed? Why do you want to pay off your house?
Or planes.
To charge money OR move the people.
Prove to me, a video of a person living on open usa land 24 hour vids for 365 days for free.
And not just a 1 hour video someone made in backyard.
And i'll give you my uncashed winning lotto ticket (worth about 1 million) i've been holding for years.
You litterally can't.
Hell, if you wanted to prove it (which you won't) you could just go yourself and live on open land for free, and make 6-12 hour vids with your phone everyday. But you would only last about a week before gov officials come get you.
And they would force you to either go back home, or go into a homeless shelter the nearest city has.
If what you were saying was true, everyone would live free.
But no one does.
And there is no proof or evidence that anyone does.
If you gonna say bigfoot exsists or shit, show some proof.
The burden of proof is on you.
I too like pretending we have freedom though.
And by charge money, i mean force them to work for the state or in jail, or find their relatives and charge them, if they have no money.
Here's cop arresting free man, who is "homeless". Just for lying down on side of walking street.
Or what i mean to say is, as you can see, there is no cop here, and people are allowed to live free.
But it sure looks like a cop...
There are some real gems in this story.
Crowdfunding grifting
Posted elaborate state-of-the-art proposals, only built an unfinished footbridge over a ditch
"Special high altitude farming technique"
Block local public roads with cars, claim it's "our land"
Threaten an innocent local with guns when he asks them to clear the road for others
Start driving around with vests and assault rifles
Didn't finalize the land purchase, moved in and started building anyway, get evicted for trespassing
Vandalize the land and signage with bullet holes and litter on the way out, out of spite
Get so mind-broken by the failure that they publicly ally with right wing ideological enemies over vaccines
The only thing this story is missing is a description of the food, sleeping, and toilet arrangements for the brief time they were out there.
recalled Black Hammer activists arguing Anne Frank didn’t deserve sympathy because she would have become a European colonizer — an oppressor — had she survived the Holocaust. That argument later caused a firestorm on Twitter and became a signature Black Hammer talking point. Before they arrived in Beaver Pines, the activists tweeted they would stay warm in their mountain colony by burning copies of Anne Frank’s diary.
I believe that would be what the niggers call "based"
why wont you take your meds allen?
I guess we could breed sheep for cotten
I prefer growing cotton for wool desu
I meant wool, but said cotten.
Come on, you know what I meant.
But sheep just eat grass and shit. And wool and cotten are pretty simular.
I would say you could do either one, but why not both?
Only one gives you lamb chops though. And fun pets.
But maybe I thought of cotten, cause that's good too.
Wool + cotten.
But you can be mayor of cotten in our new town if you want.
You gonna do cotten candy too?
this is amazing
bunp
half of the nation's land is unoccupied
always wanted to set up a dirt race track in the middle of nowhere like this
*cotton
how do people even think about living in a treeless flat barren, would crush my soul to live there
Literally cowardly dog show tier setting
crackheads will journey out to the middle of no where, 10 miles off a dirt road, ignore EVERY other abandoned barn and house along the way, and invade anon's grassy barren for reasons.
Yes, that's exactly right. If all targets have equal opportunity of being easy as fuck why would you not take the greatest looking prize? Are you retarded?
yes obviously, thats why all desert cabins hispters bought have been raided by crackheads, since they spawn out of nowhere hundereds of miles away from the nearest dealer, and shelter.
Bro, rural theft is absolutely a thing. The more remote and vacant, the better.
Not necessarily crackheads, but yeah having a pole barn in the middle no where will attract thieves like you wouldn’t believe.
Yes rural theft exists, but they exist in yuppie playgrounds, they don't even have to be close to the city, just an area well known for outdoor activities and places where lots of people go.
A barren colorado steppe isn't going to start spawning in crackheads or thieves because one anon makes a pole barn, because they weren't there do begin with to know that someone new comes in, they're either in the city, or live in yuppie infested campgrounds and cottage lands.
There is stuff like that in my state. No water, you probably couldn't get the rights in my state to collect water on the property. Lets say you could either get the right to collect water, or you think that you could have water delivered. Well to get it delivered you need a very large water tank installed, and the property is not fenced in. Theoretically some of these properties could be used to ranch, but the initial investment to make it at all reasonable is huge. Also these places are usually a few hours from a decent sized city, so you either need to do a long commute to do your cattle ranching or spend hundreds of thousands to build a nearby house.
People can turn some of these properties into ranches, but the investment is pretty big. The fact that someone hasn't already done it means there is probably better properties to do this with or the return on turning the place into a ranch is low.
Well try it and find out. I think you’d be surprised at the “if you build it they will come” adage being true in this context.
Literally cowardly dog show tier setting
kek
You really are retarded. "Desert cabin hipsters" don't live seasonally in their hipster cabins, they're almost always there full time or know someone nearby that is and can keep an eye on things. So if you think you can just drop a pole barn with clean fresh paint in the middle of nowhere and just put up a fake ass CCTV camera and signs around you're fucking asking for it to happen to you.
barren colorado steppe
If you're referring to the San Luis Valley you're worse than I thought, that place is absolutely inhabited and it's inhabitants aren't cut from the same bitchmade cloth you are. Please try, fucking please.
cucked colorado gun laws
naw no thanks nigga
Who is going to enforce them in the middle of nowhere?
And if you used one for self defense, what happens?
wow, that's crazy

Hello /out, today on my trail run I stumbled across some mountain lion tracks, pretty big as far as I could tell. What are some good deterrents? Would mace or bear spray work? I don’t have a pistol permit yet so that’s out of the question. I really like these trails so I’d prefer to not just find somewhere else to run. Was gonna report to DEC but I don’t want them to kill it if it’s not necessary
they're pretty skittish anon, the chances of you running through the woods and having an encounter are next to zero.
they're probably more afraid of you than the other way around.
eye-flash cloak
the cougar would be too confused to bother you anyhow, pic related.
usually only aggressive when cubs are involved.
in the extremely rare chance of an encounter: be loud, look big, distance yourself slowly.

You need a permit to carry a pistol on your own land? What the fuck
State land
Based
Good to know 
Yeah I figured acting big and mean would be enough for it to fuck off
You need a permit to carry a pistol on state land? What the fuck
I agree, New York is a commie shithole
Eat Mountain Lion meat, piss and shit where you find it's tracks. It'll take the hint.
Where are you around? I live in the hudson valley so pretty far away from mountain lions. Biggest we get are black bears
Plattsburgh, running at Point au Roche
Oh yeah you're up there lol bet you have some incredible forest though
Embroidered eyes on the back of your hat.
This,
Yeah as much as I dislike this place I’ll always call the Adirondacks home, never seen forests like we have up here. Picrel is the summit of Blue Mountain overlooking Blue Mountain lake, if you ever get the chance you need to camp at Lake Durant
Holy shit that looks incredible. And I agree, as much as ny can suck I really couldn't call anywhere else home. Plus now we can Dude weed lmao
its just a big cat. i could easily wrestle one down if i needed to

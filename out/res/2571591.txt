Why is that?
There is a patch thread sometimes. A lot of the patchworks that make /out/ stuff are primarily still part of the /k/ patch thread so if there isn't a thread here, ask there! You'll also get responses from the actual patch maker anons more frequently there.
As for the bear patch... The only one I was able to find was a variation on Ahoworks:
https://www.ahoworks.com/product-page/navy-sc-out-patch
Afaik ahoworks is in Japan or something for the whole month so I'd advise waiting until may rolls around to make an order. 
Also, next time you want to make an /out/ patch thread, check the archives, I think there's a template you can use. Post quality is very important to the site especially if you don't want salty fools like you see here already. 
Keep it up based frogposter. NEVER LET THEM BREAK YOU!

The /k/ patch thread has been infested with a spammer for a while. Posts are finally getting deleted now. If you /out/ists have patch ideas I can work on designs.

awesome. My man Vostok released the Smokey patch he mentioned in the last thread.

Highly recommend those patches. Especially the $15 one.

What's the "/k/ A Flat Place" a reference to? Is it just a mid-west play on "A Magical Place"?

Hi all. Just to say I'm going to have a sale between the 5th and 8th of this month because crowning a king is as good a reason to have a sale as any.
Code REX3 for 20% off.
As per >>2572875 the Tired Smokeys are now in stock (thank ye kindly for the mention).
That was me but I got a C&amp;D. So most likely that one is gone for ever. The guy never responded to any of my requests to license it :/
As per a previous thread, if anyone has design ideas for something similar let me know.
Can anyone identify the backback?

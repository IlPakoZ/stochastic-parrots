New to hiking, my son got one stuck on his head. I used tweezers to pull it out and I cannot tell if I ripped the head off or not. 
Is this just a hunk of skin or is it the guts from its head?
its a chunk of your son
You got it all, check your area for lime disease history tho
Thank you.
That's mandibles holding a piece of skin.
you can't get any disease from ticks. it's just a jewish trick to make people leave nature and get everyone in cities.
once they test you for lyme disease or whatever disease, once they take your blood they actually inject a toxic metal into your vein that they put on a needle tip.

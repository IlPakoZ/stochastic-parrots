for stories and anecdotes about having to deal with park rangers or the forest service
I've only had bad interactions with municipal park employees. I want to fuck the cute hipster tattoo bitches that work at the big parks.
ever since mountain lions have moved back into my area i have to get a lecture from some snot nosed dipshit park employee about not hiking alone and that cougar attacks can occur
i have nobody to hike with and you arent stopping me
A park ranger once tried to give me a parking ticket for parking somewhere with a no parking sign. The thing is, the no parking sign was buried in 6 feet of snow by a snow plow and was barely visible.
Most of my past interactions were okay. A few exceptions: 
One time I hiked up a mountain in a remote national park where I wasn't expecting to see anyone. Near the top, I ditched the trail and went straight up the mountain to make things more interesting. There was a park ranger on the summit that I didn't see. He bitched about how I shouldn't be "cutting switchbacks" and I was like whatever. It's not like there was anyone below me so rockfall wasn't a concern. The trail wasn't in the greatest shape either. 
Before that, I was in a national monument where some cunt reprimanded me for exploring an area off the beaten tourist path. Like who gives a shit if I step on some ugly brown dirt and sagebrush? Nothing more than an uppity cunt on a power trip methinks. 
Closer to home, a state forest ranger must have thought I was illegally sleeping in my car at the trailhead because he positioned his vehicle in front of mine and flashed his highbeams at me. This was between 4-5 am and I had just arrived a few minutes earlier to get an alpine start on a long mountain hike. I turned on my overhead light and gave him the wtf expression. He then drove away and left me alone.
I've never had a bad run-in with a park ranger. Once they came to my camp site at Algonquin to "check up" on us (e.g. make sure we had a reservation and weren't doing anything stupid) but they weren't un-polite or unreasonable, and I actually appreciate that they do things like that because there are too many tards out there chopping down live trees and camping in someone else's spot.
Last summer I went on a hike in NJ 
that had a lake at the top of the mountain, where apparently certain people who can't swim, decided to try to swim and drowned. So they put up signs saying no swimming in the lake, all these shitty NJ lakes have that sign. But at this place they had some acne faced teen that took down my license plate number and told me if I get caught swimming they're gonna fine me. And all along this trail they had little forest cops sitting around and staring at you. Didn't make it to the lake cuz my 10 year old dog couldn't make it. Worst outdoor experience I've ever had. Fuck this state.
The USFS doesn't deal with mines you blueberry gumdrop bitch.
1. They don't do it for free
2. They are an unfortunate necessity because people are retarded pieces of shit that would burn down a national park as soon as piss on it
3. You're probably one of those retarded pieces of shit and got called on it
I have some real howlers dealing with Irish irl Jannies, I will just greentext what happened to me last week.
bad day deer stalking, decide to pack it, in check on some trailcams I left pointed at a buzzard nest instead
Get beeped at by unmarked car, flashes police lights so pull over. 
Fat little guy works me over, asking where I am going, checks every license I have. Clearly thinks I am a poacher. 
Explain to him what I want, that the road we are on only leads to a trail where nothing but sheep and my buzzards live.
just repeats himself and says I'm disrespectful. Walks off in a huff and gets back in his shitty mid 00s ford saloon. 
I shrug and continue 
an hour in, start to see fog-lamps out of the corner of my eye
the little fucker has been trailing me for an hour
have to top up my tank and take a piss, so decide to pull over and make him drive up to me like an adult. 
15 minutes later he fucking revs up the increasingly poor road surface, beat-red face
 "YOU FUCKIN' GET BACK IN AND FUCKIN' GO WHERE YER GOIN EYY KNOW WHAT YER AT AN' I'VE PLENTY"
he vigorously patted his car's hood, clearly meaning his window wiping liquid which was odd because I would have thought petrol would be the concern here. 
Drive on with fatty as my road buddy for another 30 minutes. 
Arrive at buzzard bro spot, find that I forgot to remove the caps on 2/3 of my cams, and the 3 one was knocked over (but still caught momma buzzard flying stuff into her nest in 4 okay pics) 
wonder where ranger fren went?
30 minutes down the trail, see him. Arms folded. Fat bottom deliberately planted on the bonnet of his shitty ex-gardai car. Ignoring me like my baby daughter when she is sulky. 
"fuck that gobshite. . .aw jaysus. . .he will be here all night. . .ah, maybe he had a bad day"
Pulled over. Have to drive him home. 
Not to the nearest Gardai (Irish Police) Station or nearest petrol station, but his actual house, he was quite adamant. 
how do people like this have a job?
I had one in Yellowstone take my bong that I left out overnight
i was almost instant failed on my advanced road test because I (stupidly) elected to take on the same day we got hit with a serious blizzard and it was impossible to see any road sign until you were 5ft away. i was late slowing down for a school zone but thankfully the tester took pity on me
Just wear a suicide vest and if you get attacked by a cougar you can show it who's boss(same applies if you see any women on the trail)

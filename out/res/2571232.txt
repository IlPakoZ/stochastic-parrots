What bug nets do you recommend for tarp camping? Like how do i attach the net to the tarp?
They attach to the poles you use for your tarp.
so a bivac?
Just put one of these on your head when you sleep, that's what I do.
I have a sleeping bag with an integrated bugnet.
If you can get used to a bugnet lying on your face all night this is really the best option. Saves an extra piece of gear to bring out and set up too.
Can't you just lay a bugnet over your sleeping bag?
This is what I do. It works but the buzzing around your face SUCKS. Also it's itchy.
Is there a bug net that clips to the tarp? Maybe I could just make one from mesh fabric.
I'd recommend a fucking tent you knuckle dragging retard.
Yes, they are called “bug bivies”. 
Of the net is lying against your skin it defeats the purpose. Mosquitoes will be able to get to you. 
Tarps offer versatility, Anon. Some places don’t have bug problems certain times of the year. Some places are more humid and condensation is an issue.
Fucking pussies in this thread and your bug nets. Grow up. I've woken up with a snake in my asshole while tarp camping and it honestly felt pretty good. I even let him stay in there while I made my coffee. You guy are make way too big of a deal out of this

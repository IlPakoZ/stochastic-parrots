Have you contemplated the farm life? Is it possible to make okay money with a small piece of land to grow corn, beans or onions? Is cattle too expensive?
If you can find customers willing to pay for local produce at a higher price than costco/walmart then it can work.
You can also sell it for cattle food. I'm thinking how much land I would need to own to make a sustainable living
There's a lot of local farms where I live that grow seasonal stuff and rent the land to cattle farmers between seasons.
Unless you are corporate or you have family, you won't get into any co-ops and you won't be able to sell any seed. You can buy all the land and equipment you want, and some are successful, but again unless you work for a corporate farm you're fucked. 
Is cattle too expensive?
Yes. Anymore you will maybe break even. Cattle farming is not sustainable in the United States anymore. It's all from South America these days.
The profits generated from selling your own produce are usually just to fund the hobby and booze money. You still have to compete with people that have been around for years and you have to somehow make your produce stand out. People pay out the ass for garden tomatoes though.
Good for me then, since I live in Brazil.
From what I've seen, most small farms need at least one person working a regular job to make ends meet.
This dude isnt as knowledgable as he would like to think/
if you already own the land without a mortgage, and have a lot of experience with farming/ranching, sure.
otherwise, stardew valley is as close as your'e going to get.
You can profit about $300/acre
Do you have training and experience?
No. I could lease for a few years until I learn the basics
i'd start with a home garden and get a feel for it. 
if you are unlucky enough to live in a dorm/apartment, see if you can rent an allotment first. leasing a plot of land from someone is going to be kind of pricey, and it will take you a few seasons at minimum to get the hang of it.
if you have the space maybe get a feel for setting up an automated irrigation system, knowing how to do that out of the gate will free up so much time for the myriad projects you'll find yourself needing to do down the line. labor saving is essential
do you have the space to build a small chicken coop right now?
Yeah, I do
okay, so start there?
grow some hobby crops and raise chickens.
see if you like it, and if you can make it work, scale up.
going all in right off the bat is much riskier and has actual repercussions if you fail/decide it's not the life for you.
I'm living the farm life but I don't own the farm that I work on. You can do things like share-farming or share-cropping with other people where you rent the land but do whatever you want with it and normally get a house as part of the deal, but you need to weigh up the costs of the tractors and the implements and the fuel
Is it possible to make okay money with a small piece of land to grow corn, beans or onions?
Corn/beans/onions no. You can't compete with commercial broad-acre farms and supermarkets. If you own the land yourself and are super-rural maybe, but you need to look at less common but high demand plants that grow in your area. I'm in Australia and grew a great crop of finger limes in my first year as a bit of an experiment and sold them for $30 a kilogram to the local publican who probably sold them for $50 a kilo to the his other chef friends who probably sold them for $100 a kilo to chinese tourists. It paid my farm rent but it was hard work
Cattle is the key here in australia. My boss/landlord has a small dairy with a milking herd of ~300 cows that have to get impregnated once a year to continue lactating. Hereford or angus bulls go in with the herd and 10 months later a little calf pops out, but if those calves aren't Fresian or Jersey or they're the dairy variety males they don't go back into the herd and I buy them for $50 each, and raise them to mow the lawn and I make friends with them. When they're a year old I sell them for $1800 each to the local stockyard
Yes start small and get a feel for it. Find an existing farm and work as a farmhand while expressing interest for buying your own part later down the track. I bought the calves for cheap and sold them for a lot more later on but every couple of months I had to worm and drench them which doesn't come cheap, even if you buy the veterinary products directly and spent a few years learning how to do it properly. Plus cows don't just willingly stand there waiting to get jabbed or jump into the back of a truck by magic. Even the cheapest stockyard and race that sits on top of the ground will set you back ~20k, and the Cow Crush is an extra 20k on top of that if you truly care about your fleabags and need to treat pink eye or pick a stone out of their foot without getting your head kicked off
LOATHE farming with every cell in my body.
Cattle need acreage, so it's not that they are "expensive" exactly, you just need a lot of land which is usually not cheap. Ask around in your area to see how much a head of cattle needs for grazing to get an idea.
Hey fuck you buddy.
post tits
You can do it. But you need to find a niche. Like hardneck garlic, micro greens, sweet corn, cut flowers, shallots, berries, lavender, sweet onions. 
You're not going to make any money when dent corn is $6.50/bushel and basedbeans are $10.70/bushel. And you only have five acres.
You can raise couple head of cattle on a few acres. Hopefully you have enough land for them to graze. Otherwise you'll be buying hay and feed. Also you'll need to sell the cows locally to make any money. People will pay top dollar for organic grass fed beef.
I have cousins that raise cattle, and I live out in the country. Across the creek is a large farm and undeveloped forest. It is very quiet and peaceful, but I have internet and a PC and all that you know. I will tell you what I know.
Agriculture is seasonal work, so some days it is very little work, some days you are busy all day long. It's hard work but it's nice to be out in nature all the time, and owner-operator households can do well, even small family farms. As long as you are growing what people need. The median owner-operator farming household income is about $90k, depending on the crop or animal cultivated and the success of the farm. It is essentially a small business, but you are feeding society with food it needs to live.
Grain is the foundation of civilization, and the most widely grown grain in the USA and in the world is corn or maize. It's grown subsidized as a monocrop, does not make a ton of profit, but the government subsidizes the crop because people need the grain to live and sustain society. As a monocrop, it's grown on a very large scale, tons of acres and expensive equipment. Same with cattle, a "small" cattle ranch is like 200 acres and 200 head of cattle.
If you are some sort of homesteader or small family farmer, as opposed to a large commercial farm, you may have to specialize to survive or thrive. This is typical, cash crops or heirloom crops or anything you can make a living on without thousands of acres or millions of dollars like a giant factory farming food corporation. Like a small business, you will need to plan it out ahead of time, and you can also work with organizations relevant to your produce. For example, if you raise pigs, you will need to buy piglets from another farmer, or to go to another lettuce farmer for example to get good information on the best practices and seeds.
This is the traditional way to farm, you can sustain your own farm and even work the farm as a family.
The food you grow is sold to grocers, farmer's markets, some sell produce directly online.
Traditionally, with cattle, it is auctioned off at a cattle action or sold to a processor. The auctions have people bidding on cattle and an auctioneer calling out prices and counting offers for the sale.
Large commodity crops like corn and wheat are sold on a large scale into commodity markets, like the Chicago commodity futures exchange and the Midwest corn belt. For large scale production, live cattle and pork are also traded on commodity markets, which lets farmers buy futures contracts to guarantee a fair price ahead of time.
You should really have a realistic plan and understanding of how you will sell or market your produce, as well as grow and transport it. It's not rocket science, but a farm should be well planned and requires a lot of hard work to succeed.
Not all crops or livestock have the same economy of scale either. A small herb farm can return the same profit as a large monocrop corn farm, as herbs just command a higher price by weight. Things like herbs, cut flowers, heirloom crops, good for small scale growing. Smaller animals like pigs and sheep are also more economic for smaller farms, you can run like 30 hogs per acre which is solid money. Roses are another crop that is good for family farmers.
How much net profit do you make per year and how much do you work realistically a week ?
Bonus question, was this achievable without generational wealth ?
Super curious to know more and please be realistic, we re all anon here.
Cattle are expensive to buy, and land is expensive to buy. But you can with some experience lease land, and graze other peoples cattle for a flat rate or a weight gain contract to pay the bills and make a profit, while you establish yourself saving up for land, or capital stock. Ironically it often cost more to lease land than it would to pay a mortgage on it, but that way you don't have to convince the bank to give you millions. Just other farmers or livestock companies to give you stock, which also might be worth a million if you have a bit of scale. Those connections themselves are something of value that someone starting from scratch might not have but people like stock agents can help out of course for a commission. Might not be what people imagine as quiet farm life doing your own shit when you have a whole lot of guys on your case about their stock, and land owners on your case about maintenance etc. Jumping into farming is jumping into running a business and its one where you need to be a jack of all trades. And be comfortable working off on your own a lot with no one else there to fix something that went wrong. Like any business I'd say if you are thinking of starting one, maybe go work in the field first or get educated some other way, until you know you aren't going to cock it up..
Full grown cattle are expensive, but why would you buy something ready to slaughter? Calves are $500-$750, and I don't see that as expensive considering you can get up to $5000 when grown. The entry price for farmland on the other hand is getting to $10-20k an acre around here. The land is the up front cost to start.
Of course you don't buy ready to kill. It's fair expensive when you are talking about raising a good number of them. Not too bad to raise one or two. But say 500 you're talking about a pretty big chunk of money to stock a place. And I don't know where the hell you are getting 5 grand for a grown one, please share I'd like to send some as well kek. Obviously land is a huge investment but I'm just pointing out it's not the first one you need to make, if you can organize yourself a good cash flow, land becomes something which pays for itself, and you can do it on someone else's land.
No.
Market tampering and foreign competition pretty much price out all modern farmers. The only way you can survive is with government subsidies, but even then, you're basically making as much as a school teacher does after deducting expenses.
Physically, it is one of the most rewarding jobs available, but the ratio from income to labor is completely fucked.
Market tampering and foreign competition pretty much price out all modern farmers
Somehow food remains on the plate despite farmers being price takers not makers.
The most efficient haven't had them for 40 years and export 90% of what they make..
I wanna homestead but knowing how my body just randomly shuts down cause of my disabilities, I'd definitely need to hire help
And also I think I wanna be an ag pilot doing crop dusting, but I might not even get past the starting gate cause of the aforementioned disability
But yeah generally as with anything, start small, start cheap, don't drop a paycheck on something you might learn that you hate
Somehow food remains on the plate despite farmers being price takers not makers.
Because the government is literally keeping them alive through subsidies.
I was a farmer for three years. If you actually knew how low the profit margins were you would want to kill yourself. 
I could've literally made more money working in a Chinese sweatshop for $2.50/hr.
For every single acre of produce you grow a season, the Chinese are growing multiple hectares of that same crop. When I was in business I was competing with corporations that had flooded the marketplace with so much product that it had deflated the price by over 1000%
Seriously, it's not worth the trouble.
These things can happen. Like I said farmers are price takers. When I talk about a place where there hasn't been subsidies for so long I'm talking about NZ. Initially everything went to Britain. Then Korean war happened, and wool was like gold. NZ was the richest country in the world per capita for a time there.
Britain joined European EEC and that market was lost for a time. Then the subsidies went away too. It literally cost more to have a sheep killed then the meat was worth. There was a protest where some folks herded a bunch of sheep into the middle of a city and cut their throats there to show how worthless they were.
Prices these days are a lot better than that. Ironically with you winging about the chinese, a lot of that is to do with their demand for meat and milk. No one said it was an easy life, mate. But it can be profitable. It remains the largest export earner for the country and more or less was the only one during covid bullshit. A lot of those old guys who stayed on through the shit times, are sitting on very valuable pieces of land.
it's very hard to sustain yourself while paying all the bullshit taxes the government robs us with and you also need to be a rich to start if you didn't inherit anything
You can work up to a manager job that might be 80k a year and then when you have the skills and gear to manage a place you can think about leasing one and might make double that, or might make fuck all
this post is delusional
You been out of it for a while?
you will never make 80k
most engineers that spent 200k on their degrees and don't make that much
My mom is buying 10 acres of nice land to build a mini farm and asked me to help build it/maintain it while she travels, in exchange for putting my name on the will. Any tips? We plan on raising hogs, chickens, and goats for now
I should clarify this is not for profit, but self sustenance
Use chicken poop for fertilizers. Learn charcuterie and maybe homebrewing. That's what I'd do
Is she flighty? What's the chance of her changing her will sometime down the line. Why not just put you on the deed.
Meant to say deed, my bad 
Yeah I’m gonna dabble in a few artisanal hobbies, would be fun to get into blacksmithing. It’s right next to an Amish community so if I can get cool with them I’m sure I can learn some craft/trade with them
And fuck the Amish girls
So crop sales are a total loss, but I'm curious on what the overhead is on sheep for wool production. Is it a huge upfront investment to get into the game with breeds that produce quality wool?
Amish girls gotta be undercover sluts
What area friend, I'm near Holmes county Ohio
Depends on area, Lancaster county PA amish aren't any different from the world in their attitudes.
Northern NY, west of Ogdensburg
Oh wow I really forget there's amish that far north anymore. 
NY is a terrible place to homestead though friend.
Sheep are based
Wool isn't worth shit (0.7-3.5 usd per kilo, depending on quality). You can use the money to cover sanitary costs though
I own of the Corriedale race, we work on genetics to make them better
How so?

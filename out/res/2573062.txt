Not sure if this is the right board but how do i get in this lock? I got a cabinet from an antique store and these doors are locked
Looks old as fuck. I highly doubt that has a barrel in it. Chances are it's just a latch in there.
Great way to get some lock-picking experience is to go to a bridge, and find those padlocks where normies write their name on because they're in love and stuff.
If you can get them off, you literally have free Padlocks for life, that you can train on.
It's akin to kicking over cairns. It makes normies seethe.
Barely a lock. Pretty common on cheap furniture. The key will be like picrel. You just need to get something L shaped in there and rotate it round that center pin.
what the hell does an antique lock have to do with the outdoors?
I'm gonna order one of these and see if it gets me in.
...any lock
When it turns out to be a dybbuk box and you end up haunted by a demon, I'll see you on /x/! Good luck!
Just bring your chester drawers to a locksmith and ask him for a skeleton key that will fit and he probably has one.

Which axe are you using when /out/?
Any brands to stay away from?
What is a good length?
a lot depends what you want to use the axe/hatchet for while out. pretty much every shape/weight/length is a compromise in some way so you are looking for something that will fit your individual needs. hultafors, hults bruk, gransfors are the fancy names but something from fiskars or gerber probably would work just fine too. 
for me i'm using a hults bruk aneby - it's kind of a compromised axe since it's too short to do any true felling work and heavier than needed just for in camp splitting jobs but on the otherside it does both of those jobs adequately which is what i needed for winter camping. would probably recommend the almike to most people.

If the weather is warmer and I just want to split some small stuff, I bring a hatchet. Otherwise I go for the "pack axe" size. Estwing, Fiskars, various Bruk companies (except globohomo Gransfors), and Prandi are solid. If you don't want to consoom new shit, consider swiss surplus or buying an old head off ebay and hanging it yourself.
Cool!
I've been looking at the Fiskars X7. 
Any experience with that?
Yeah, I've used it. You won't want to take down trees with it or anything, but for small stuff around camp it's nice. It comes with a plastic blade guard that's pretty meh, but Fiskars now makes recycled leather sheaths with better coverage.
My Gransfors' are the peak of my collection, but those are more suitable for shaping lumber or felling than bushwork, bucking, rooting, etc.
I use a Fiskars X7 for trail maintenance on the property - great hatchet for the money. I use Estwings as well, mostly the "fireside friend" splitting tool.
What's the deal with Gransfors? I got them because they are universally recommended for timber framing and I've been learning that,
never needed one 
crazy shit to bring /out/
What about a hatchet?
GB is now part of "agenda 2030" which is a UN scheme to make the world perfect. Has things like responsible environmental usage and clean energy, but then also has "equality" shit that has nothing to do with making axes. Looks like some make-work diversity hire compromised the company.
Ahh that definitely sucks. I became aware of them from boomer forums so of course that would never be mentioned there. Appreciate the heads up.
You can't go wrong with Fiskars. IMO it's the best budget option. The only thing about it is the plastic handle, but to be honest it simply takes a beating. Fiskars is giving 25 years limited warranty, so they are pretty much sure about the quality.
I have it, I find it to be too small for my taste so I use the bigger X10 instead it's a great one. I split 30 quintals of firewood this winter using it. That said, Fiskars is great quality all around, so if you find X7's size ok for you, get it.
The fiskars x27 (big splitting axe) hurts your hands if you use them enough, i split a lot of wood by hand for a homestead and to sell on the side and was in great shape for it, x27 was a good splitter but ruins your hands if you put any actual work in. The metal is also not a good quality, dulls fast and rusts.
Thanks
Fiskars x7.
Pretty much the best axe for camping.
i have the x7 and whatever the long splitter is called 
they're g2g, as long as you're not retarded then breaking the handle is just something that's not gonna happen
I want a tomahawk or slip fit axe like a Rinaldi but can't justify buying one since I barely leave my yard.
Do not buy/support Gransfors Bruks. They're globohomo WEF as fuck. They don't even want people to have campfires for fuck sakes (MUH CARBON EMISSIONS!!!). If you go with swedish axe, go Hultafors (Hults Bruk) or Husqvarna.
carbon, really?
trees are the definition of carbon neutral.
Buddy got me an axe for christmas, use it to split small logs for his woodstove once. Mainly just sits in my car though lol
I got me a SOG throwing ax,. It's pretty reliable, I accidentally lost it in some grass and had to burn it, so I replaced the string on the handle
Marbles, as recommended by our king

Pretty sick!
i have an iltis, pretty good laser after flattening.
also didnt cost me a penny, my gramps had like 5 of them in different head sizes
What's the deal with Gransfors?
same as all scandy shit, short cutting edge and brittle steel
but muh forge scale, muh sovl
Ooooh we coping?
why? because i didnt suck them off? i gave you two very real drawbacks their heads have.
I have a heirloom axe with even shorter blade, like 6cm. only thing it is good for is splitting kindling.
Inaccurate, but they do still suck because they're sellouts to the globohomo
I just picked this up today at a garage sale for a cool $1. Planning to take it with me into the boundary waters this summer. There were probably a dozen more, but this profile jumped out at me
Council Tool woodcraft pack axe or my Fiskars x7...honestly only ever get used in my backyard to chop kindling for the fire pit, but I take them if I go out because I like the larp.
Well Gransfors is apart of the Agenda 2030 so.... yeah, they're fucking cucked.
Wranglestar is a retarded shill who couldnt chophimself out of a wet paper bag. Only faggot soiboys watch
I love my Harbor Freight hatchet. I scraped the varnish off, treated it with boiled linseed oil, and got a nice leather sheath for it from Etsy. Is the full-size axe from Harbor Freight just as good value? It goes for $30 and I've been thinking about picking one up for more local wood processing. I wouldn't bother bringing a full-size axe on a camping trip unless I was car camping.

That axe looks defective
you like mine.?
Got a loicense for that m8?
Haha they sell the best camp tools. By the way you can make your own sheath from leather, it's really easy if you have a Tandy's nearby
True chav knoif.
this guy has excellent axe content. from buying guides, to axe safety, to reprofiling axe heads to cut effectively. 
Here's one from a playlist, but you can search "axe" on his profile for everything else.

Can anyone ID this axe? any chance its something decent or just a standard hardware store hatchet?
this is a good one about hatchets

Which axe are you using when /out/?
Gerber Freescape Hatchet or my Wetterlings Small Hunter
Any brands to stay away from?
Coleman and gas-station stuff
What is a good length?
19"
163kb
Great picture there, frogtoes. Any markings on it that you can see?
163kb
yeah I know its from a kijiji listing and that's the resolution on there. I asked about any markings and he said idk come look at it. he just wants $10 for it so I might just buy it regardless
I bought a 5â‚¬ por quality non sharpened axe at a chinese store, what's the cheapest way to sharpen it so I can use it?
the cheapest way
On a river rock.
a file is all you need
I have an Adler Rheinland Axe. Honestly not sure I'd recommend it, I only got it because I needed a hatchet on short notice on a Sunday and it was what I could find in stock locally. It's not a bad piece but I think it's too much head for the handle, it'd work better with another 4" or so of length, kinda tempted to see if I can replace it someday.
hardware store sharpening stone. I found one for $2 at a Chinese grocery store for kitchen knives.
wraps a textured, synthetic handle
you're so...
..
special
the edge insanely over ground. Even if it had a makers mark of something once valuable it's fucked up beyond being valuable anymore.
thanks

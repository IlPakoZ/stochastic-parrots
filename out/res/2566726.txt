Wheres the ideal tropical land to survivemaxx and live off of fruit and sun in the wilderness?
You should move to Sierra Leone
Very funny
Except I actually chase my dreams :)
but you aren't.
you are just trying to get others to idly fantasize with you like incells jerking together on discord.
Sad inner projection, too bad I am White and you are not.
kek, post nose.
Tristan de Cunha

its not even the most remote
that'd be the Pitcairn Islands
Technology isn't a substitute for common sense.
i didn't really know much about it but reading about it is insane. an island, 1.7 square miles. 50 people on it, practically all descended from some mutineers from an english sailing ship hundreds of years ago.
they've "sustained themselves" this entire time. i guess you have to hope that you can put up with the one or two potential suitors on the island.
i think it'd be cool to have drones or satellites monitor sentinel island. i wonder what shit they get up to out there.
Hawaii
eh, the locals have thing for beating the shit out non-native hob- I mean yes! go be a beach bum in Hawaii OP, capital idea!
The truth of this will be lost on OP
I live on Guam but if shit hit the fan most tropical islands will go full Lord of the Flies real quick. They're usually net importers because they aren't big enough to supply all the food and goods that support their population size.

And we can gamble on what ever they do. Every now and then some prisoner gets dropped off there on a boat and we can gamble on what happens to them too.
yes, it's true that no woman will ever jerk you off or otherwise touch your genitals, but that does not imply that anyone who refuses to jerk you off is a woman.
What's the point of supporting that island? I really don't understand why the government would waste so much tax money paying for some shithole full of criminals that can't support itself and doesn't benefit the mainland in any way.
He means the men will evade you. If so much as one man survives when you fall asleep, you can pretty much bet your ass he'll try to finish you off. Keep daydreaming though, I guess.
I reckon a random island somewhere around Indonesia/Philippines. They have thousands so you have a good chance of never being seen.
they had a bit problem with kiddie diddling and sexual/domestic abuse there for decades
bri'ish govt got involved directly and basically all the men on the island got charged for grooming 11 year olds to be married as sex slaves. 
now they survive through tourism, being an obscure URL address, being a tax haven and by taking turns flying around the world appearing at conferences etc to talk about how remote they are.
like any small barely-inhabited island, for control of ocean territory
the reason countries like France, the UK, New Zealand etc are even relevant in global politics is that they own stupidly large areas of ocean territory because of random dipshit islands they own. 
this is why the chinese are so perpetually buttmad all the time trying to sneak armed fishing boats across the pacific as far as the Galapagos Islands, is cuz just a handful of tiny countries cockblock them from just taking over the entire pacific thanks to owning random islands from 200 years ago
Dreaming is for retards! I mope and do nothing and am smug about it. Much better!
but that's what you are actually doing tho.
Based Guam poster. TDY'd out there for years, fantastic place.
realistically probably chiapas due to the land being dirt cheap and water being abundant
Locals are super friendly to tourists it seems they just don't like it when the mainlanders move there. I could live on Oahu or the big island easy in a decked out transit or sprinter. You'd just have to keep up the facade of being a tourist. I also don't like the majority of mainlanders that live there cause they're either rich and super entitled assholes, or actually homeless and really uncomfortable to be around so I get it.
Well Elon Musk seems to prefer the beaches of Texas
Which is why you should turn your dreams into practical, realistic goals and plans, and then fulfill them. Instead of just fantasizing them. You have to make it real.
I knew a guy who lived like this in Hawaii, he lived on spearfishing tropical fish from the beach and water from bamboo plants. He was a homeless beach bum I guess, but he knew how to survive in the wilderness, then moved back to the mainland cause being homeless on the beach wasn't all it's cracked up to be I guess.
The problem is when you let other people tell you what is and isn't possible, instead of just being ambitious and doing shit. A real man tanks control, and the rest follow along.
If I advertised my dreams, people would shit on them, but I've already made them real. I have new dreams, new goals, beyond the knowledge and in some cases the understanding of mentally defeated people with broken dreams who just want to shit on you like crabs in a bucket.
Don't let your dreams be memes, anon.
This is how leadership works. You have someone with a vision, a plan, and you have people who share that dream and want to make it real with you.

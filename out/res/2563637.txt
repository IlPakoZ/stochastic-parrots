I’m starting the Appalachian trail in May, I have a job and a career going so I am not doing a thru hike. I will be doing a 2 week long section to start with, and probably more similarly long sections in the future until I finish. I hope to make it into North Carolina at the very very least, which is very doable as I’m young and strong. I believe it is only 70-80 miles to the border on trail.
What should I pack as far as food? I think I might only pack for breakfast/lunch, dinner is nice but I dont need to carry the extra weight so I will have sleep for dinner.
Should I just go for maximum calorie density like picrel? I will only be on trial 2 weeks so protein or vitamin deficiencies arent a huge worry to me. I have heard I can mail a package somewhere to resupply with further down the trail, how can I find info on how /where to do this? I might pack food for one week, resupply, and then hike until I run out of food.
I do not have any specific set distance in mind, my goal is to go as far as my feet will carry me in 2 weeks without hurting myself.
What is the longest backpacking camping trip you've done?
9 days
If that's the case, you shouldn't of made this thread.
What a miserable creature you are
Fuck off
I’m trying to be as weight efficient as practical, when I did the 9 day trip I was fairly light weight but I feel like I could have done much better. 
Should I leave my stove at home and only take meals that I can eat cold? I have a water filter so I don’t NEED to boil water, but I have both filtered and boiled in my past experiences due to the water in my area being nasty.
You're a larping faggot and your post clearly shows it. If you been on a 9 day, you would've gave examples of shit you have eaten in the past trips, what you like and dislike. Not sorry for being a "miserable creature" for calling out your lying ass.
Lol, see this>>2563663 faggot.
Damn, you really caught me, I was trying to lie about camping for not even a week and a half on an anonymous anime image board, and you caught me red handed
I’m glad there are people like him to call “people” like you out
At any rate…
Ramen noodles are light weight and high in carbs, you are right that you won’t be out there long enough to warrant needing much else but pure carbs
You can eat them dry and uncooked but they are obvious best cooked which requires water, so you make the choice on if you need the stove or not. I would say if you get picrel or similar, you will be fine. You will be dying for a hot meal by the end but there are a few towns you can stop and get some nice hot goyslop at along the way anyways
Do you feel a sense of purpose trying to gatekeep the outdoors? Do you look at yourself in your mom's bathroom mirror every morning and say "yeah, today's the day I keep someone from enjoying the outside"?
The fact that you keep samefagging him kind of proves his point, seems like he touched a nerve with you. Feel free to samefag me with discord memes as well if it makes you feel better.
Can't go wrong with a bunch of Government Cheese.
Me in this thread arguing with myself (Only I have posted here)
Anon, I have bad news for you
Emergency rations are for emergencies, you should never actually eat those things unless its a life or death situation. Bring oats, meat, and coffee.
Thanks for the actual advice
You too
It honestly depends if you are ok with having to cook often. The simplest/ cheapest would either be ramen like the other annon said or get a bag of rice and bring seasons with you. Preferably at least two different types like a yellow rice seasoning or desert rice. If you do have cash to spare you can just shill out for the freeze dried stuff they always sell at any sporting goods stores or mountain house.
should I skip meals
only if you're fat otherwise no
two weeks section, what food
well...
take the same stuff but add five more days worth of food
You are a profoundly lame faggot
OP, don't forgo protein, you risk overuse injury if you do. Here's a few food items I like to take on longer trips:
Breakfast: instant otmeal, dried fruit, full-fat milk powder, instant espresso
Snacks: mixed nuts, dried fruit, M&amp;M's, granola, fig newtons, dry-cured sausage
Lunch: more snacks
Dinner: trail jambalaya (orzo pasta with tomato soup powder, creole seasoning and summer sausage), chickpea or lentil soup (chickpea or lentil flour, chicken stock cube, seasonings, olive oil), loaded mashed potatoes (potato flakes, full-fat milk powder, dehydrated chives, shelf-stable bacon bits, cheddar powder), Knorr sides.
what food should I bring? Just calorie dense?
Yeah, kinda. Stick to at least 100 calories per ounce or greater. Food alone is a pretty big subject.
skip dinner
Terrible idea. Because of the nature of a long hike, you’ll be burning through a lot of calories. You’ll need time and food to recover. 
what about this meme food?
Have you tried it? Would you really want to eat it for 9 days straight? It’s not survival, it’s a hike. Why punish yourself? Also, do you think you’ve somehow figured out a better way of doing things than thousands of people who came before you? Hikers generally heat up meals because it’s more enjoyable than eating a block of cardboard or a bowl of cold grey mush.
protein isn’t a worry for me
Well it should be. You need it for muscle recovery. It’s also much more satiating than carbs. Fiber can become a concern as well.
how do I into resupply?
Look for an Appalachian Trail guidebook or online guide. How and where you setup a resupply depends on where you are. Sometimes you can mail a package to a post office in a small town and they can hold it for 30 days, but you have to plan to be there at a certain time (small town post offices often have short hours, aren’t open on Sunday, might be several miles from the trail, etc.). Sometimes there’s a hostel you can send it to. Sometimes neither is a viable option but a grocery store is. Even with a location, you still have to figure out how to get there.
Fucking make one, nigger. It’s free and your trip can be ruined without it. You’re going solo, possibly well after the crowd. Thru hikers move in a giant mass, and if someone needs general info they can just ask another hiker. You might not have that option, so a plan is a necessity.
Take gelatin powder as extra protein.
ok gatekeeping faggot, you've dazzled us with your edge. now please fuck off. i'm monitoring this thread because op's question interests me and i'm looking forward to actual replies.
If you plan on sending a resupply ahead of you, you can bring whatever. If you plan on heading to a grocery store in a town then you’re more limited, especially with dinners. It’s much more convenient to measure and prep at home. 
Here are some of the things I bring. I rarely bother to cook breakfast, never cook lunch, and always cook dinner.
breakfast
Bagel with bacon and single serving Nutella packs
Hostess donuts (don’t hold up too well)
Instant grits
Instant oatmeal
Shelf stable bacon with pretty much anything
Cereal or granola bars
lunch
Tuna and crackers
Pepperoni, cheese, and crackers
Tortillas with just about anything (peanut butter and jelly is ok)
dinner
Skurka’s beans and rice (google the recipe)
Instant rice with dry sausage, tomato powder, a bullion cube, and Italian seasoning
Bear Creek cheese soup w/tuna
Just about any Knorr pasta side (look for ones that cook faster) with added tuna
Mashed potatoes with chives, cheese powder, and sausage on the side
Ramen if I’m lazy
Shrimp gumbo 
Dried pineapple and coconut 
Dried oranges
Snickers
Cliff bars like a normie
Fritos (they hold up really well)
Trail mix, again, like a normie
take 9 days worth of food and bring a .22 rifle. Only eat that 9 days worth of food when you didnt find something to shoot.
It's only us 2 and the IDF
You're so butt blasted that it's not even funny. I bet you'd suck op off if he gave you chance.
Since anons aren't answering
Pouched tuna
Rice
A stick of salami
Pouch of instant potatoes
Grits
Cornmeal
Honey
If coffee drinker, instant coffee and powdered creamer (can mix creamer into rice or grits or cornmeal
This should give you a start

This guy has a mega chart of backpacking foods (free pdf in description) might give you ideas for balancing your deliciousness/weight/calorie density choices. Good luck on your trip.
This man fucks. OP if you're still around this guy knows what he's talking about.
Don't skip a meal. 
Plan to eat more often, but not necessarily more food. Trail mix might seem silly but even if you're just plopping your ass down and having a little water break, a handful of sugars and protein can help you soldier through hard spots later. Remember that hiking is a game of attrition, and it's dependent on your previous and current ability to contribute to your future ability. The protein is very important in keeping your muscles from damaging themselves and the day after a hike hurts a hell of a lot less with protein in your meals. The fiber should also be considered because if you're like me you have a hair ass and you want clean, easy shits. Simple. 
I don't have a specific set distance
That's how hikers die and make us look retarded. Get a map. Get a compass. Learn how to use both of them together, and set yourself a destination for every day that you have food inside your pack, barring an emergency supply of food that you may need if it storms and you need to hunker down an extra day. My advice is to do what the poster I tagged mentioned, and start finding out exactly what your menu will look like when it is a day's worth of calories, then multiply that by two weeks. You'll have an idea for how much physical space and weight that you will have to budget for. It will depend on the pack you carry the rest of your equipment in how many straight days you can go without a resupply. Speaking of
How to resupply
Now that you have a basic idea of how physically sized your tentative food needs are, you know how much to plan for and what to order. My advice here is to change your menu because you're probably sick of whatever you copypasted onto your plate for the past week.
How much distance did you cover in those 9 days? Just a general question to understand your pace, because now you're measuring your time x distance x food.
lol fag
Don't just bring emergency rations anon. You must instead go down the food autist rabbit hole.

OP here
9 days
I covered around 130-140 miles
no set distance
I have since realized that this is not a good idea, I would like to make it to Fontana Dam in the two weeks, and I am working on planning out days right now. If I can keep atleast a 12 mile per day pace, it would put my a little bit past there on the last day. I think that that is very very doable for me as long as I keep my feet in good shape and dont push myself too hard any one day. I have a feeling I might make it there earlier, but we shall see, in which case I will notify my pickup driver and continue on to a pre determined alternative pickup location.
makes sense, its called trail mix for a reason I guess, would it be viable to eat trail mix and other similar snacks instead of having a stove?
Fontana Dam as a destination with planned mileage
You came up with a plan, so you’re no longer a nigger. Beyond Fontana Dam is GSMNP, which is usually pretty crowded along the AT, and you have to stay in designated shelters. The only good place to get off the trail next would be Clingman’s Dome, which is another ~35 miles. If you hike up to it, people will stop you and ask about your hike. As someone who looks the part, you’ll be a novelty and part of the national park ambiance to the people who just drove up. It’s happened to me on two hikes, with multiple groups of people chit chatting. 
The Trek has a list of places you can resupply, and most of the locations early on make it fairly easy. So you won’t need two weeks of food, just money. 
https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/resupply-points-appalachian-trail/
The Hostel Around the Bend is about the halfway mark for your hike. Might be a great place to wash your crusty clothes, take a shower, and get a ride into town to resupply.
What you’re talking about is called a “no cook” setup. It can totally be done, and some people prefer it over a stove, but it’s not a popular choice for a reason. It’s only two weeks though. Ultimately it’s your call, but I wouldn’t do it.
 I do not have any specific set distance in mind, my goal is to go as far as my feet will carry me in 2 weeks without hurting myself.
lol carry 1 weeks of food and mail yourself a package for the second week
you've never gone backpacking before, have you?
This meme needs to be updated. StarKist is once again selling 2.6oz packets of plain chicken breast. It feels like they stopped making them years ago. The caloric density is pretty low compared to tuna but it’s nice to have the variety, and opens up more possibilities.
based
Not gonna make it bros. If it's shelf-stable and you buy it at a store you're poisoning yourself
Even though nearly all homes have a cheap and easy way to make dry foods (oven or air fryer) consoomers still rather eat tasteless dried foods covered in silicone for double the price. I like to imagine about how many companies would go belly up if the modern person was just 5% less lazy
Was going to post these. But yeah, use resources like this to assemble calorie dense, somewhat nutritionally sensible, varied meals. With a little bit of forethought you wont have to eat the same thing every day for a week. 
Also he has a video on how he plans out his meals, breakfast, trail snacks, lunch, and then a big meal after making camp for the night. You don't have to go that crazy but thing to eat before you start moving, relatively quick thing to eat while moving/without stopping for too long, then large meal that can make use of your full cooking setup because you're already at camp, isn't a bad way to divide things up.
You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.
I used to eat those survival biscuits in Op's picture with coffee every morning. They taste really good, pronounced metallic taste to them in between sweetness and a bit of fat. Anyways if you plan on using them for hiking you're gonna have a bad time since materially it clearly isn't enough nutrient to trick your belly into thinking you're full. Instant rice is light and filling if you mix it with a nutrient dense source
I've been looking around in the local dollar stores and they many of their fatty carb type crackers have very high caloric levels. 800 in one case for a bag of rice crackers at $2 which is pretty good considering you can easily munch three a day in normal conditions.
Two week hiking without ample resupply, why are you even doing this to yourself man. Even army guys don't do this
AT thru hikers (thru hikers in general) are a pet peeve of mine. It just seems so sheltered to me that they live off of pre-packaged food the whole time, creating piles and piles of trash in the process. Doesn't seem very /out/, just seems like normie tourism imo.
I understand that catching your own food would take more time and isn't always a guarantee, but I never hear about anybody bringing a fishing rod, let alone a small .22 or snare wire. I'd bring a big bag of rice and another bag of oats and then catch/cook everything else. I'd also bring tea and coffee.
You've never done that yourself
People want to walk a long distance not gut animals and starve to death
You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.
Not that anon, but other than giving you back pain and sadness, what does eating pemmican and whole potatoes do?
NTA, but I’m the one who originally typed it. It was in response to someone who was asking why he shouldn’t just start walking from his house into the woods and keep going for weeks (or something like that). Now I’ve seen it used just calling out general newfags and larpers. For instance someone dropped it in the alcohol stove thread when another Anon just said to build a fire to save weight.
Why did goverment cheese fail ? Why don’t they do it anymore ?
They do.
The dairy market stabilized so the government no longer needed to buy their product to keep them afloat.
Are you seriously suggesting people hunt and slaughter animals on the AT instead of packing out their meals?
Does anyone on this board actually go outside?
Pennsylvania here. We have a section of the AT that runs through state game lands, so technically it's possible
I'm here to reply to this because my reply totally contributes to this thread.
too bad the republicans took away this delicious cheese.
welfare (food stamps) was privatized so that rather than the government providing the basic food necessities. welfare recipients go to the store and buy foods made by private corporations.
Add this to the list. I make myself a nice chicken soup every 2-3 days and it’s shelf-stable. I recommend using the entire pack before breaking camp. Something squishing it back open in your bag will ruin your trip.
One thing I do recommend to everyone here is a good percolator. Get steel, not aluminum, and preferably with a glass top. It’s more than just a coffee maker, it’s a boiling vessel with a lid, spout, and sieve/basket. You can cook very creatively using one. It takes up a significant amount of kit but consider that it is multipurpose in its approach.
Yeah, these Tyson pouches have been around but they’re pretty big (7oz). The StarKist pouches are 2.6oz, so it’s more like a single serving.
t. never gone hunting before
only the few oldfags remaining (who happen to be animeposters)
Sure smells like summer in here
He said that because the suggestion that you could hike hundreds of miles and sustain yourself on wild game is pretty outrageous. Anyone who’s hunted and hiked knows this. 
the AT goes through game lands
You got a loicense for that hike? The AT is the exception, if you’re doing a section or through hike (out and backs don’t count). 
Yes, because rabbit, squirrel, and deer season in PA ended months ago.
Bring a gun and eat other hikers

Gatekeeper / Elitist-faggots:
NOO YOU DON'T HAVE A LOICENSE FOR THE OUTDOORS, YOU CAN'T INTERFERE WITH NATURE AT ALL, EVERYONE SHOULD LIVE IN A POD AND LOOK AT NATURE ONLY IN PICTURES ON THEIR SATANIC PHONES, WHICH BY THE WAY DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU MANUFACTURE THEM, BUT KEEP REPLACING THEM YEARLY

NOOOO HOW DARE YOU FREAKIN' EAT CHICKENS AND KILL THE CUTE HECKIN' PESTERINOS IN YOUR HOUSE, YOU NEED TO ONLY EAT MONO-CULTURE SOI BEANS, THAT'S WHAT OUR SUSTAINABILITY EXPERTS(TM) SAID, ALSO, PROTEIN BAD, AND EXISTING IN BALANCE WITH NATURE IS BAD

Kek, going to keep doing what I'm doing, and not only that, but I'm spreading my way of life to my neighbors and within my community - even this post, will, hopefully inspire some anons to improve.

what was the point of this blog post?
Awful lot of work for a bait thread. Tolstoy/10
Thank you Anon
so i'm vegan but i prolly have a different view than a lot of people who are. i consider humans and animals to be equal, and if a human managed to hunt and kill a wild animal in it's natural habitat with their bare hands, no weapons or traps, then by all means, you deserve to eat that animal. animals eat eachother, it's nature, it's how it is meant to be. but i jus don't like humans who try to justify eating animals, when those animals are bred and raised in captivity with no option to fight back. i'd be extremely impressed by any human who could catch and kill a rabbit in the wild with their hands... but you won't. :)
what was the point of this blog post?
OP wants to share the fantasies and arguments he has in his head.
This, why do you think so many Ted worshipers and other turbospergs feel comfortable touting their ass backwards viewpoints here? They're fucking alone and that's starting to do the damage it does to everyone, or they're incapable of sharing said ass backwards views with the people in their lives for fear of being ostracized. At least here on the 4chins they find validation for being retarded.
How you take care of the animals you shelter says a great deal about what kinda person we are dealing with
i'd be extremely impressed by any human who could catch and kill a rabbit in the wild with their hands... but you won't. :)
This is why we developed hunting tools, we aren't animals.
how do I do it OP?
how do I become a forest wizard?
I am from Washington and I hate my life in the city
I constantly have visions and dreams of the world and the sea, I know it will be hard and maybe I will die, but for some reasons that makes me want to do it even more
but I'm afraid if some american hillbilly sees me in the woods they'll gun me down and eat my corpse
what are some supplies I need and where should I head off towards
I don't want to be killed my feds from accidentally coming across a secrete wendigo breeding facility
chasing rabbit is easy
you can just step on them, the problem is it's a lot of work when you can just set snares
much harder is catching them alive to breed them
my point exactly desu
humans are lazy. always want the path of least resistance.
you can just step on them
bruh you can't sneak up on one with those ears and you can't catch one with those legs
humans are weak and lazy. we are only suited to growing crops. :(
adapting to the environment and bringing tools into being imbued with purpose for the hunt is somehow "lazy"
clear demonstration of why the vegan diet decreases grey matter
okay even with a knife or tools for the purpose, how many people actually go ut and hunt their dinner?
compare that with how the majority of the human population actyually consume their meat, which comes from battery farms where animals are caged as soon as they are born.
based on our physical form, we're clearly not suited to hunting, so we had to cheat.
decreases grey matter
honestly i'm not even gonna disagree with you, cause i know i am dumb. but i was dumb a long time before becoming vegan :)
okay even with a knife or tools for the purpose, how many people actually go ut and hunt their dinner?
no anon we were talking about your retarded comment misconstruing human ingenuity, the one thing that separates our species from everything else on this planet, as negative. The (((((food industry))))) and mass-produced goyslop is another issue entirely.
based on our physical form, we're clearly not suited to hunting, so we had to cheat.
we are homo sapiens faggot, we are suited to whatever the fuck we come up with. 
If you think our species spending millenia of blood, sweat, and tears, painstakingly crawling our way out of a terrifying existence, being picked off by disease, natural disasters, and mindless beasts, rising to the point where you can sit here and type this on a piece of technology that would look like magic to our ancestors, is "cheating" then its truly fucking over for you.
honestly i'm not even gonna disagree with you, cause i know i am dumb. but i was dumb a long time before becoming vegan :)
you sound like a woman its kind of hot ngl
you sound like a woman its kind of hot ngl
i type like a woman wtf?
yeah i understand that our best feature is not our form but our function, our intellgence, and it is what lead to our dominance. i definitely wold have died off if i had to survive while also being vegan.
in my own head i simply can't justify using tools and traps to kill and eat animals, when they are not doing the same to me. don't get me wrong, if i met a black bear (we're the same height, so using it for this example) and that bitch wanted to fight me, i'd kick and punch their fluffy face and try to win, but i wouldn't want to grab a knife or gun, unless the bear pulled one out :3
call me stupid, i get it, but that's how i feel. anyway sorry the shit up the thread but it was a stupid topic to begin with, do better op
~160cm tall
vegan
types like a woman
so cute... Its ok anon I will protect u from the bear with a proper firearm if u dont wanna use weapons. Th bear has heavy armor and a mouth full of knives, ig using firearms would b fair. Ur too precious to lose from this world.
Not OP btw.
black bears are 160cm? i thought they were like 1.9-2m tall when standing on their hind legs. i'm 190cm not 160cm...
it's weird that you've decided i'm a woman in your head but it feels nice to be called cute.. no homo..
mouth full of knives
yeah bears probably have the advatange if i am unarmed. and again that's kinda my point. i know my place. i'll stick to the fields tending my crops and jus hope lions, tigers and bears don't come for me!
i thought they were like 1.9-2m tall when standing on their hind legs. i'm 190cm not 160cm...
I took the midpoint between 130cm and 190cm, still adorable, much better in a way...
tfw no 190cm friendly vegan farmer femboy bf
what crops do you grow? Which one is ur favorite?
ngl i'm giggling at how quickly this turned around. 5 minutes ago you called me retarded and now you want me to be your bf.
what crops do you grow
sadly none atm. i live in an partment building and don't have a garden :( once i have to money i am gonna move and definitely start growin my own food! starting small ofc
i think i would like carrots and potats to start, along with some apple trees. it would be so satisfying to cook using ingredients i grow myself. jealous of farmers and people who have land desu :(

Do humanity a favor and do not reproduce.
i don't plan to, but if i do i will adopt, just for you, anon.
you sound like an insufferable fag, shame we share the same hobbies
Remember agafia? Her brother used to chase rabbits on bare feet. That's do adorable. I miss him so much..
It's conservation of energy, not laziness. Do you think the fox makes it harder on itself by only using his paws to hunt rabbits? It uses everything available and with as little effort as possible. If a fox could set a snare, it would.
You don't get /out/ much, do you? If you can stay still long enough animals will literally come up to inspect you, especially if you have food. Most animals these days have little fear of humans, because they aren't regularly hunted. Unless you are overt they don't automatically see you as a theat. Works with rabbit, racoons, squirrels, and deer. Haven't tried to snatch anything that came up to me because I'm not trying to get bit, but I'm pretty sure I could.
Our physical form evolved to run animals to death. Basically humans can out distance large prey animals. We evolved to just follow them until they are exhausted and then stab them with a pointy stick. It's agriculture that ruined humans.
i'd be okay with that minus the pointy stick
my perspective is not shared by most people and that's okay i'm not trying to convince anyone, i just thought i'd shared my own view on being vegan since it's not stereotypical
You don't get /out/ much, do you?
idk more than some, les than others. i love being /out/ and try to as much as i can :3 i cycled to a friend's place with all my camping gear the other day and we then hiked out to find a comfy spot for the night.
Do you think the fox makes it harder on itself by only using his paws to hunt rabbits?
well i assume they use their teeth as well. chomp.
if you stay still they come up to you
yeah they do and it's very cute. like you, i've never tried to catch one from this position, but i reckon they would flee at the slightest flinch and be out of sight before i could even react
That fox is gathering bait for his snares.
hehe :3

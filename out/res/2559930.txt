most of the trail runs along private farmland or highways crawling with 18 wheelers
1/3rd is water
the trail will simply run out in many places since no initiative has ever been taken to finish it due to the impossible ambitions and monetary requirements

random unconnected section way up on Baffin Island

Haven't something like 18,035 people completed this trail? It's not a huge secret or anything.
anyone know who the adventurer that crossed canada by dog sled, started out in kaktovik alaska and planned to make it to the atlantic ocean, but along the way he was forced to shoot a polar bear attacking his hut, and the canadian natives wanted to prosecute him, he ended up deleting his youtube channel and disappeared off the internet. i think he was from norway, time period was sometime between 2006-2012, had long hair, medium build, in his late 30's early 40s
I live in Southeast Alaska and it looks like it goes from Whitehorse to Beaver Creek then goes up and stays into Canada. I don't remember a road from Beaver Creek going up like that. This would be very creepy during large animal calving season because I always see Grizzly Bears.

I've done the tiny section that runs through my area. It's actually pretty nice in some parts but definitely very mixed. I went through private logging land, rural water infrastructure service roads, plus some relatively pristine park sections. All in all I liked it and really enjoyed being able to just buckle down and walk a long ways without thinking too hard. Really gets a guy in the zone

And maybe why ?
I don't smoke, I can't afford it and I don't like the smell. Have you tried not being stinky?
Bugler hand rolls, so I have to really want a cigarette enough to roll one.
Camel. Roll my own. Shit habit tho, quit for 2 years...but not really since I'm back at it. 
Honestly thinking about switching to cigars or pipe tobacco for a while and keep it for 1 or 2 times a week, if I manage the cravings. 
Or back to the whole e-cig and nic gums until I'm able to not be an asshole to everyone else without nic. As I said, shit habit.
Hm I only rolled one pouch, was shit at it. Now I have camel unfiltered.
I like camel and I'm Fr*nch, but even for me unfiltered camel is too much
TLDR: Dark blend in a soft pack.
Stopped 4 years ago but until then I liked whatever the froggies made with a dark tobacco like blue gauloises or Gitanes with a filter and prefereably in a soft pack. It always has that one extra cigarette when you thought it was empty.
But since its all either Altria/ Philip Morris or British American Tobacco over here the blends are pretty much the same no matter if its Luckies, Marlboro, Gauloises or whatever, the old brands died out about 5-10 years ago.
It's the occasional cigar or pipe 2-3 times a year now.
back when i smoked, camel wides
i kinda miss being 20 again desu.
And american spirit yellow are kinda good
/out/
smoking
Even more evidence that you fags are all a bunch of larpers.
Pic related, my bugout bag.
Too bad those Camel Wides are impossible to find.
Yeah this a larpboard. If you want to see true outdoors men then fuck off back to r/hiking
This but unironically.
Do you realize this only now? It's like thinking /fit/anons actually go to the gym or /lit/anons reading a book
My man's got all the essentials, including cat food and ti-83s
Camel Turkish Royals, always
/out/ doesn’t have janitors. Moderation happens when something is flagged and a site-wide mod decides to do what’s he’s not being paid to do. 
Something like this slips below the radar because the mods simply don’t know any better. 
we smoke outside huhuhu
Things being done outside are not the same thing as outdoor recreation, and it’s not gatekeeping to point out that threads about smoking belong on /b/. 
I like to spend like outdoors
Cool, what do you like doing? Hiking, camping, maybe fishing? Plenty of people around here hunt. I used to kayak a lot. I saw a guy online who liked to climb trees, complete with climbing gear.
I smoke
I've really been wanting to try sniffing snuff but heard that most people that use it snore badly. I don't have anyone to bother with snoring except for myself, though.
I smoke 
Kek
Not like it replaces anything better. There was /out/ with a pipe
2023
smokes
yeah.
Whats next
2024
drives a gas car ?
Faggot
2023
Not smoking 
Worlds going down faster each day bub, smoke um if you got um
I don't smoke but I still think smokes are smart thing to take with you. Natives smoked, cowboys smoked, soldiers got smokes in their rations... it's just part of the deal. Keeps squitos under control for one thing
I used to do that shit in high school when we couldn’t escape to the sports teams locker room for a smoke. Great memories of doing bumps in the darkroom in photo class
I remember being 17…
I love NIL whites (classic old german brand)
Since we have these canceruos pictures pictures on them i always grab one with the smoking baby.
I was in Germany for the first time a few months ago and picked out that exact pack to keep as a memento
I use nicotine pouches, like dip but it's tobacco-free while still having a good kick to it. They get me through my days.
I also roll joints with weed/tobacco though with whichever rolling tobacco I've chosen. Drum blue, amber leaf, player's.
Camel Blue Compact. I like the regular blues, but those have the faggy white filter, and 50% of smoking is to look cool. 
I use it to tell wind when hunting, also I light one up after a succesful shot just so the animal can die in peace. It's good to smoke while waiting, at least you have something to do.
where the fuck do you get strawberry limeade amp? used to love that shit but haven't seen one since 2017
second year when i grow my own, i have 90 plant seedlings atm
seeds cost me 5 euros and 300 pipe filters were around 8 euros and smoked half of those in a year so cannot argue with the savings
I smoked for a looooooong time. Started with Camel Wides at 12, regular smoker at a half pack a day by 19, and finished with Spirits like so many others. I've had such a brutal relationship with cigarettes over the years, lots of my best friends smoke and many of the best memories were enjoyed with a cigarette in my hand but honest to god the health effects were just not fucking worth it.
I had quit for 4 years when I relapsed into nicotine addiction due to a super stressful dream job I got. Smoking was one of the few things that felt like calmed me down, and it suppressed my appetite which meant I was able to eat fewer lunches and get more work in... I thought that was a win-win for a long time hahaha.
Anyway, did that for just 2 months and it was like those 4 years off never even happened, I felt the itch so bad again and was totally hooked. I needed to go through the whole withdrawal process again, kicked it off with a big send-off solo backpacking trip in '21 where I just went fishing lakes for 25 miles as I dwindled down to my last fag. 
"End of the Line" I called it, and that was the last one I had. I still think about it all the time, how easy and comfy it would be to light up again on a cool fireside night, but I have to remind myself that I've got shit I wanna do with my life still and each cigarette robs me a little bit of that. Training for my first mountain marathon this August and I've never felt better in my life. It's really worth it to quit some time anon, I did it by reading Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Quit Smoking". Obviously if you love it, you love it and I don't fault ya for it, that shit is comfier than fucking anything, but once you live without it, it's like you unlock another level in life.
I prefer lucky strikes myself. Something about it feels right, if not then camel wides or
Mavericks if I’m poor. I have a feeling like most on this board there will be a day where I leave the tobacco for good. Yet for now I’m glad I have it.
It's pretty gay smoking.
each cigarette robs me a little bit of that
Nigger, that's why I smoke lmao
That's actually sick. Do you treat it with anything ( like chemically) or do you smoke it pure ?
i just press the leaves into slabs and cut them into strips that i dry and smoke with a pipe
really easy and cheap considering that 20 pack of smokes cost around 10 euros these days
Acid C notes, not only because I enjoy smoking but also to stink up my area as much as possible to lower property values, bother normies, and women hate it.
TWO sawzalls
doritos
multiple energy drinks
boat shoes??
backup ti-84 plus
dozen of random probably-empty lighters
please be real
Montegos or lucky strikes cause im fucking poor
Marlboro southern cut, not often but its nice at night under the stars
American spirits orange or gold. I don't smoke often, and I like that they last a long time.
Mods get paid. Jannies do not.
Same but gave it up a month or so back. Circulation was getting fucked.
Do they get paid in Reddit coins?
I smoked a pack a day from about 18 to 30 and then mostly quit, I only smoke socially now and go through maybe a pack a month. Marlboro 27s are my usual choice but my favorite are really Mevius when I can get them, which has sadly gotten really hard in the last few years.
he hasn't seen it the 8700 other times its been posted in the last 5 years
also that
fuck it maybe ill apply next time jannies open, off topic LARP shit has rekt k, then it ruined ck and now it's happened to out. reddit just has so many giant assholes though.
How do you dry or cure ur tobaccy, I've got the space and want to also grow some.
Take the pipe pill my friend. 
Inside a little while ago. Found a blend called Haunted Bookshop which ticked boxes for me. Also one called Peterson early morning pipe. 
With those 2 blends I'm all sorted.
*I did a little while ago
Fuck autocorrect
they hanged from my kitchen roof for a month
at this point you could moisten them with rum or whatever you want i have heard, you could also fry the strips but i have never tried that
I dont smoke often but my favorite cigarettes ive smoked are nats rich taste
I've only ever brought one pack, years back, and have never smoked a single fag of it..
I carry it everywhere and occasionally use an unlit cig.
It's a daily reminder of self restraint and my weakness.
I'll light one on my deathbed.
That’s probably cause nats is made from cigar tobacco. It was made cause a customer of bat Sherman’s was upset he couldn’t smoke a cigar on a plane.
I like Marlboro Reds.
They taste nice and cost less than other brands.
I have American packs, cause the EU sucks ass
I guess you are in the Eu thrn, where do you get ametjcan packs ? They look duch much better.
I know they used to include cigarettes in old military rations. Would it be possible to store them indefinitely if you sealed them with one of those boveda humidor packs? Or conversely, to rehydrate an old dry pack using the same stuff?
Sure do like giving a dollar tax every time I fuck my body up with cancer causing bullshit that would make anyone unaccustomed throw up. My favourite brand is fuck you but ill probably still buy your vape!
You ever get the blocked nose and have a smoke, because why wouldn't you if you don't its bad news, and then you realize that all you can taste from it is ashtray
Cigs were in rations because without them there, some of the grunts are going to go to any means to get one. They are going to scour the position. They are going to wander around like a goddamn retard and hassle someone who brought more, or could afford more, and then they are going to break it up and re roll it in a piece of newspaper. And then they are going to smoke that shit while sitting on the gun with everyone else asleep and get shot in the face. But damn when they spark it up, it's good for morale.
Lambert and Butler Blue but I want to quit and i'm currently trying to cut back.
Camel crush menthol. 
Its a treat to me.
If I do a good hike and walk up somewhere one of my favorite hilltop lookout spots, then I can smoke one cig and relax.
But otherwise I don't smoke alot. Maybe 6 cigarettes a week if that. A pack will last a month or more.
Marb red 100s they just feel and taste right to me
I enjoy smoking, but got shit genes for it. I've got no living males in my family past 52 years old. All who smoked, all got lung cancer or stroked out early. Mom used to smoke and got cancer + stroke too. My older and younger brother have both had minor strokes. Much as I'd like to, fuck it, seems a shitty way to go from what I've seen. I used to smoke fucking unfiltered pipe tobacco in rolling papers, cause one or two hits of that stuff would have me crusing fine. Headrush for days. That, and that Arabic stuff, dokha, I like that stuff a lot, seeing as you only need a pinkie-nail's amount in a fancy crack pipe to send yourself sailing. I still have at least a few ounces from the one bag of 35$ pipe tobacco I've bought, ever, and have been smoking from since I started dabbling close to a decade ago. Long and short, I'd love to, if it didn't have the track record it did in my family.
only smoke brands like winston and american spirits, ingredients in cigarettes should be limited to tobacco and water. almost all commercial cigs have 100s of bullshit additives. youd have to be retarded to smoke them
does your family eat a lot of fried food or foods cooked in sneed oils/margarine (including snacks)?
nats are also great but expensive (altho I think around the same price as spirits)
best option in terms of both quality and cost would prob be to buy a fine rolling tobacco and roll your own
How do you carry your ciggies while /out/?
I have a brass tobacco case I really like, some repro of an early 1800s pipe tobaccy hinged deal; holds like 15 cigs.
Anybody have one of those HBC ones with the magnifying glass lighter in them?
moisten with rum as in slightly spray with rum or distilled water?
I am growing some havana seeds this year and have grown tobacco before but never have cured or fermented them.
anyone tried hestia cigs? just ordered some from what some friends recommended
Don't smoke on the regular as £12 per pack is a fucking scam. I did get some Camel "premium quality 1913 blend" softpack fags from Poland and they are pretty tasty and for only 16 zloty. I occasionally use nicotine pouches but stopped vaping ages ago. Trying to lower my tolerence to nicotine so i can have the occasional cigarillo and not feel like i am dying of cancer or getting addicted.
I don't smoke atm I used to smoke Winfield Blue, I'll start up again when cbd hemp ciggies come out here just for the taste.

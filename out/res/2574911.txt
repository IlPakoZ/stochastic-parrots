What electronics do you recommend when you are innawoods?
what is actually useful and what are memes, in your opinion
Haha wat?
Toss an Airtag in you bear can or bear bag and if it rolls away, you can easily find it again! Pretty neat idea I came up with. It is better than using reflective tape, we aren't in the 80s any longer.
Oh, can't forget a Bluetooth speaker either! Keep up the banger tunes to ward off bears!
You should just home. All your electronics are already there, and a comfy bed and trendies
Gosh isnâ€™t it time for a nap?
So you recommend absolutely nothing in this list? Wow you are so l33t
Swag
/thread
If you use this, you'll blow out that little ember which you just struggled to get hot. Don't use these! Never blow on a fire! Your body also emits CO2 which makes you a biological basically fire extinguisher
For me its
I think that's about it
Oh and a rechargable handwarmer/powerbank
picrel
Yes they're heavy, but they're great for casual camping.
And the opinions of UL fags don't matter anyways.
And not really a gadget, but I always bring a sheperds sling with me.
They're great fun.
have you ever started a fire??
No, it was always burning, since the world's been turning.
Is this a table? I suppose this would work well for a butane stove
This looks like something you could use to make a sling. I suck at knots though
Flint is great to have unless you like rubbing sticks or carry metal cans of gas
You can still make do with just sticks. You can even build your own tools in the wild.
Here is my survival spear, built it very recently, to save ammo when hunting.
You can basically rebuild primitive society as far as you can see fit.
Sometimes, I wonder.
Could we live in a new way outside the system?
I already know rednecks who live off the grid.
Could we be independent, yet parallel, to society, by severing our dependence on its infrastructure and systems?
Interesting food for thought.
It's a chair. But you could use it as a table. Or whatever.
That's PATENTLY untrue.
Rhetorical.
It's in the thousands. I'm not even exaggerating.
t. professional festival fire sculptor/firetender
(yes that's actually a paid thing. Free vacations.)
nice piss bottle
KEK!!
That's gatorade...HOT WORK.
phone
the rest are memes
headlamp
the rest are memes
If you ever hiked more than 3 miles, you'd be dumping useless weight any way you can, and shit like this would be the first to go.
He looks 32. She looks 14.
Your bear can should be farther away from your camp than Bluetooth can reach.
Sure, but say you put your Bluetooth tracker in a can 300ft away and walk back to camp. Then when you get hungry, walk in the general vicinity of where you left it and Bluetooth will help you zero in on it
Theoretically yeah but that sounds like a good way to get waco'd
Don't forget portable Bluetooth speaker. 
Why he look like Jared Leto's joker tho
Was my thot.
But didn't poast b'cos Koresh was still on grid...
They prolly coulda pulled off NOT.
But they were.
t. Saw LIVE.
The original justification was for when it rolls away.
Still applies, larger radius to look for it. I personally don't that it's so great an idea that I'm going to buy an airtag but it has merit.
Completely? Mostly no. You'll have to work within the system and pay your property taxes, hunting permits, etc. Otherwise sure, plenty already do. It's a rough life tho.
Rebuilding primitive society with duct tape. Not picking on you anon. I get what you are saying. Just thought it was mildly amusing given the picture. Have a wonderful day and carry on.
the industrial revolution and it's consequences have been a disaster for the human race.
Is there a dehumidifier tool when tenting or hammocking? The human body loses like 1L a night from exhalation and I feel we can do better than just relying on airflow... Are there rechargeable ultralight dehumidifiers? Some people also mentioned silica or charcoal to absorb condensation
True I forgot that last time, thankfully someone else brought theirs
I found this $10 tripod stool at bass pro that I strapped to my pack and that worked really well for me
best apps for camping?
what else? Spin the bottle app?
Trips and OP kills himself
Get the First Aid App from the Red Cross!
inaturalist app for plant identification (unless anons recommend a better app)

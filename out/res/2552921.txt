not even 2 hours away from my car

God messed up this time, he'll get it right the next
If this actually happened to you then congratulations. You almost feel what it's like.
Personally I've almost died like 7 times and I joke about them all.
I almost died and you think it's a good thing just because I don't use the exact same gear as you
Not him but yeah. If you don’t have anyone else to talk to about your exciting experience maybe you should be getting some IRL friends instead of doing this on the internet.

I almost died and you think it's a good thing just because I don't use the exact same gear as you
not him but death to all frogposters
What does that have to do with my post.
you don't have friends you should die 
you aren't UL you should die 
you post frogs you should die
go mountaineering
am the only one using a wrist strap on my ice axe
get mocked for how fiddly it is everytime we make a switchback on the glacier
get to a boulder field
lose footing because of a loose rock
fall down 5 meters before my axe lodges itself between 2 boulders
come away with nothing but scrapes and bruises
hang by my wrist strap
Thanks wrist strap.
from image immediately deleted by Jannies
Why? Can someone point to the rule?
Complaining about the moderation is against the site-wide rules.
was the image out related?
our hot pocket eaters are retards
Not knowing the difference between a legitimate question and a complaint is a sign of brain damage. 
No, it was a crying Pepe animated gif. Do all images have to be out-related?
Yeah the janny here is relatively based and laid back but has a weird hatred of pepes and apus
has a weird hatred of pepes and apus
we'll allow it.
same shit happened to me,
tumbled
then slid
broke the phone on the way down
broke my leg 
drag my ass back uphill and set the bone and splint it.
improvise a set of crutches
limp my ass six miles back to the trailhead and the car. 
Shit's funny now, and I almost NEVER make fun of people with trekking poles now, even if they're not carrying anything.
real?
Yeah as far as moderation goes /out/ is pretty great. Uh, uh I mean mods suck my cock wait no that's gay uhhhh
Tells internet user to not use internet 
continues to use internet himself
Please think before you post.
/out/ doesn't have jannies or mods idiot they come from other blue boards like /lgbt/
You‘re laughing
My hands hurt and you‘re laughing
Fuck that sounds rough. Getting a serious injury like that while deep /out/ is one of my fears
The jannies on /o/ and /diy/ don't give a shit about frogs. Whoever moderates here is a special kind of autistic.
be me
climbing Mt Shasta
it is getting steeper and icier but I'm too lazy to pull out my crampons and put them on
slip and slide back down like 500ft
Post a greentext story when you actually die. Let us know if you are allowed to fuck goats in heaven or have to suck satan's peepee in hell. Also, is god based (no trannies allowed in heaven) or not (allows bankers).
Nioce 
be as a sixth grader way back when, field trip w class to a very nice mountain park area 15 miles from school. 
a nice canyon with a tiny stream that runs most of year, a trail goes up canyon. 
me n my buddy decide to go off trail to a higher ledge way above trail just because to get another view of trail, its all beautiful, huge boulders size of twenty city busses if they were all crumpled in a ball, just scattered.
you can't really appreciate the size unless you get a far-off view to imagine how the separated from hig canyon and rolled to where the are, as the main trail goes between them. 
I'm abit more agile that my fat tall friend, tell him not to follow when we get to a tricky part.
he followed anyway, steps on loose rock and starts slide down to a five foot ledge onto another slide then three foot ledge and slides down 20 feet.
I hear him going AaaaAaaAhh whump AAAhh gurgle thump and dust going up.
Go as fast as I can to catch up to him.
He's all dusty and tore his shirt and bounced off a Cactus.
I laughed a little but helped him up and pulled stickers off his back.
We didn't tell anybody but walked back to campground and waited for everyone else to comeback.
Good times
As long as it's fixable with first aid, you'll be ok. 
and shock is your friend if you know that it's happening and use it to your advantage to set the bone before it swells up and splint it. 
Always have an IFAK and know how to use it and you'll have nothing to fear.
A thread died because a fat faggot didnt
Thanks for the info. I will learn from your mistake and buy a wrist strap.
this is /out/ newfag no one gives a shit besides 3 autists
Did you keep going after that? And more importantly, do you have a quick first aid kit to clean wounds like that and dress them?
You cared enough to have a little tantrum here in the thread. Good contribution.
You cared enough to have a little tantrum here in the thread
What I just entered the thread you're autistic.
the first time I went /out/ I didn't have proper shoes and I chickened out of a ridge that fell right off the mountain on the side. I'm still certain I had a good chance of actually dying and maybe it would've been better that way.
The /out/ jannies are extremely unbased. I was once banned for telling someone to post nose, and have been banned numerous times for "racism".
bounced off a Cactus.
*inhales*
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
bump
 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
bump
Maybe you should take the hint then. Also complaining about the janitors is against the site-wide rules.
Post nose.
maybe you should stop being such a kike, plenty of safe spaces on the internet for your kind already.
Imagine if that was a compound fracture...
Carry a tourniquet, peeps. Remember, HIGH AND TIGHT.
It was disappointing to discover OP's image wasn't a gory picture of his fucked-up hands.
Naw
Take the hint
Take the hint
That you're Jewish?

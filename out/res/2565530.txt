go out
see this
What is this clip from?
It's a documentary about eugenics.
Idiocracy, pretty good film
oh no, must've dug too deep and ended up in china
Nah that's just the modern US.
I don't remember moving to San Francisco
Actually crazy that this could be our future. I understand that some people can completely disregard climate change (Even if they really shouldn't)- but why don't people ever talk about Plastic/Styrofoam pollution? It's massive and insanely more fucked up and noticible than any other environmental concern- but we always gloss over it
They need to do a second movie where the guy gets hibernated into the wilderness of the future and slowly gets a grasp of the degeneracy of humans the further he goes into civilisation. It should be a dark tradegy where he finds God at the end during a horrible painful death.

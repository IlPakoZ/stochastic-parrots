Hike thread:
Post photos of hikes you've been on this year. 
Discuss hiking in your area.
I've been using old OS maps to discover routes in my area, what are you using?
from yesterday, some BLM land near my place without any roads, and no people. and i'd like to keep it that way. (western oregon, near eugene) 
all the normal/public hiking trails out here are filled with people, littering, and just obnoxious bullshit. the whole point of going out is to get away from that. the go-to popular 'hike' in my area (mt pisgah) is awful. 
i just want to get out into the forest, let my dog run around exploring, and be alone.
Lovely photo anon, bet that spot is good for amanita when the season hits.
Went to a nice moss floor pine forest near me a few weeks ago. Technically private land so no other people anywhere. Went totally off trail for about an hour or so, found a little stone circle. Not sure how old it is. Sussex, England.
Wow, any other pics?
Not of the circle that's any better than that.
Was a funny one because amongst the pine deep in were some, what I would call, ancient trees. I thought this one was particularly nice, got a few centuries there. Found lots of signs of deer and wildlife, felt very alive there compared to a lot of managed English forests. I've only been the once but will go back, it's within a few miles of a neolithic settlement (which is also on private) planning to visit that in the next few weeks. Just getting the lay of the land properly to make it least stress.
Did a few miles today with the youngest two.
Took in the long man and Alfriston.

If you have to take a shit out there, people from miles away will see you do it.
Didn't see anyone in 4hrs but theoretically correct.
Mt Pisgah
15 minutes from the center of Eugene, OR (not hyperbole; it really is that close)
”it’s so crowded!”

People on the west coast are scared to drive.
I think you missed my point? I don’t understand the appeal of going on a hike with 150+ of your closest strangers. So if you know of a great spot, sharing the location is a bad idea.
alone
with my dog
just fuck it at home like a normal person
t. Leaf
There's an area near me with 30 miles of trails on 2500 acres
I'm gonna try to do every trail this year
Did about 3.5 miles, 1200ft gain the other day to ease into it
Of course she does. Jews hate everything that is good and wholesome.
They're genuinely scared of being outside of safe urban areas.
No idea how they survived 40yrs in tge desert.
Well that IS a show of God's power after all in the Bible.
No idea how they survived 40yrs in tge desert.
They are blessed by G-d. Same reason why Israel is such a small country and able to defend itself against all those surrounding Arab states.
That's very based, anon.
America was, at one time, blessed by God. The state of Israel is blessed with foreign aid and US tax dollars.
Yesterday in the Whetstones.
Beautiful country.
I personally know Jewish people that love hiking and camping, and there is even an organization for Jewish farmers. You know Christians can live in the city, it is just a stereotype, but it ain't right to generalize people over their religion.
God gave all the lands and creatures under the power and wisdom of man, but a responsibility to take good care of it. All of creation is beautiful really, but it is people who are proud and sinful.
I'm sure there are thieves, murderers, liars, and New York Times employees who love to hike and camp, but it doesn't make them good people. Stereotypes exist for a reason, and yes, it's right to make generalizations regarding religion. It's up to the person who claims a religion to prove they don't fit the stereotype; it's not up to me to assume they don't fit the stereotype. The vast majority of jews LOATHE hiking with every cell in their bodies, and as for the ones that don't, well, they're still jews. Until I meet a jew who doesn't celebrate corruption, fraud, degeneracy, and the manipulation and control of the people by the government, the jew stereotype will remain in effect.
Stfu I live in a tent on a hillside in shomron I see deer and snakes when I brush my teeth in the morning
I'm an Orthodox Jew I am a good person
Today I visited the worlds smallest Alpine mountain range. Spring is truly the best time of year for hiking
I also had a luck with animals today. The most fun/terrifying experience was when I met 3 shepherd dogs. I knew shepherd dogs are one of the most aggressive towards strangers, so I stepped off trail. But guess what, they started barking aggresivelly and started to come closer. But then I noticed they are just teen puppies. So instead potential death, I just expected ripped pants. But as soon they sniffed me, suddently they were overwhelmed by joy and started jumping on my leg. After that, they were my buddies for 50 meters, then they started playing in the hay pile. I was short on time, so I was forced to leave them.
I think it was one of the best hikes that I experienced. Theres only one negative thing and one regret. The negative is that I couldnt bring homemade plum spirit with me because I was driving. And the regret was that I didnt bring any bell or bear spray. I got lucky that no furry fella came to me to say hi
Bell or bear spray for bears? In the Tatras?
Yes. They got very ballsy in last couple of years. Local governments are in arms race with bears over dumpsters, with new lock design every year. Now they started a program to give locals bear sprays for defence againts bears.
Based international criminal settler. I was in Israel a few months ago and I gotta say it's one of the most underrated /out/ countries I've ever seen. Especially considering the region. They do a lot to protect nature compared to their Arab neighbors. 
I picked these Arbutus fruits somewhere in the Judean hills area. Lots of trees there. All the ancient accounts say they taste like shit but I thought they were pretty good. Kinda like honey.
Here's another picture from the Judean hills area.
Negev is beautiful. Those patches of green in the middle right are apparently the old fields of the nabateans who were once able to farm here thousands of years ago using rain water harvesting. Researchers are trying to recreate it.
Nice pics desu I think the Golan is the best part of the country out wise but I wouldn't pick to live any were over shomron here I get the best of out life and community
Snow pack still pretty deep in the PNW
I live in Idaho but I travel to the cascades for hiking sometimes. I think of it as fair enough because you guys come and shit up our public lands all the time. I dont pay for a discover pass BTW.
kind of hot anon
based, I can't wait to make Aliyah.
Mid Norway, mostly just a big looming forest in my area and there's tons of nice trails in it. Taking the train to Hell next month after my exams and cycling to a national park close to the Swedish border to see some more exciting scenery. Picrel is from a skiing trip in March, it's kinda bland I know but still pretty comfy.
Do it I'm an American expat myself, quality of life here is much higher than in the states
Don't you have nice forests closer up north? Don't blame you for coming over here anyway, it's my favorite place in the world, but don't use other people's shittiness as an excuse to shit up things over here.
Overlook on one of the trails from the backpacking camp at Castle Rock State Park
Not exactly a hike but I went on a photography day trip at the beach and got this awesome cormorant shot
I live in the north panhandle, we have good forests and lakes here too its just a different kind of biome. I dont shit up the place but I'm not paying all your silly state day pass fees.
more like kike
I don't think I've ever been in the Golan, but I was at the Hula Nature reserve which is pretty close. Saw probably tens of thousands of storks stopping over on their migration. Probably the biggest concentration of wild animal biomass I ever saw in my life. 
Not really a hike but this is a picture of the dead sea around sunset. Couldn't tell where the water ended and the sky began. Really trippy sight in an already really trippy place.

quick backstory
i am not allowed dogs in my apartment, even though i own it, because of """noise"""
but ... BUT i am allowed birds, no specification, i GENUINELY considered getting some chickens and a rooster, as under the law, only hoofed and clawed animals are prohibited withing city liits, like cows, sheep etc.
but there is NOTHINg prohibiting birds, initially i considered getting 2 macaws, but they live for so long, even i wasnt petty enough
yes this is my unhinged rant about figuring out how to make a lot more noise then a dog for the smallest most stupid reason.
1 rooster 3 hens?

Bernese mountain dog. Have fun with them anon they’re awesome dogs.
Chickens aren't loud. Get a few Guineafowl.
Bobo

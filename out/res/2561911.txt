Any bird watchers here? This isn't my usual board I just wanted to see if anybody wanted to talk about birds. Pic related is a heron at my local park. I don't have a good camera so I took a pic with my phone through some cheap binoculars. For some reason I can't get it to not post sideways.

Fucking gayyy.
Haven't for years, nobody wants to be doxxed for posting a photo here.

I would love to do it but professional cameras are expensive, so I just photograph animals and plants within my reach and post them on inaturalist to archive them and get help with identifications. 
The birds I photograph are usually either dead or blurry and distant.
Yeah birds are cool, I should go out more often and need a larger lense. I use a 55-300 now
This time of year is prime birdwatching season for me. Spring migration is in full effect and there are large wildlife preserves near me with ponds and relatively dry walking paths. I'm hoping to finally see and photograph a wood duck this year. Most larger birds (eagles, ospreys, hawks, herons, egrets) are kind of meh to me now. And Canadian geese are the absolute worst. 
HONK HONK HONK
I enjoy bird watching. Eastern Phoebes are nesting on the side of my house and it's really cool to watch them build their nest. When I'm off work I like to watch the Chickadees, bluebirds, and gold finches that come to my bird feeder.
Sure, I enjoy watching birds. Not to the point of taking pictures of them and learning names, but I like them.
I have a uncanny ability of finding dead birds though.
[[[THEY]]] can still see your metadata
Used to do it a ton as a kid. I could identify basically every species of bird in my area way back in middle school. Im not nearly as hardcore about it now, but I like to watch them sometimes while I'm hiking or something. Every spring and fall when I go fishing at the river I always see tons of kingfishers there with the same idea as me. Maybe I'll take some pictures of my own from now on.
dont take pictures but love bird watching. Always exciting to see something uncommon. Saw a large flock of cedar waxwings at a local park and hearing a brown-headed cowbird for the first time is quite special!
ugly fat brown people don't want to be doxxed 
It's always been that way
Fucking hate these things. Shoot at least 20 a year
Screenshot image, crop, and post.
I wish I knew more about birds. I even got a peterson california bird book. I took some with a canon with super zoom (best way to "get close" without spooking.)
Funny looking turkey there, bub. What's it taste like?
I think its a vulture. These guys are my garbage disposals when I kill squirrels. I leave squirrel on tree of sacrifice and they clean em up. 
Heres a photo of a I believe this is a Red Breasted Sap Sucker
You are right.. Turkey Vulture.
So what's it taste like?
Just got back from the park. Saw some Canadian geese, red-winged blackbirds, Bluejays, mocking birds, a great blue heron, and a pied-billed grebe. The grebe was really exciting cause I had no idea what the funky little duck was. He was swimming underwater to get away from me just to pop up on the other side of the lake. Here is a picture of a mallard with what I belive to be a domestic mallard. It was brown and white, slightly larger, and a lot braver than the other ducks there. Thank you for subscribing to my blog
I don't know much about birds other than I like seeing them while out. I use a phone app called 'Merlin' to help me ID birds. Saw a Pileated Woodpecker on a hike yesterday, was too busy staring at it to take a picture.
One thing I'd suggest to anons with cameras, try taking the pictures anyways, even if you just have the kit lens for your camera, you might be able to crop your way to an okay picture!
Went out yesterday to spot bluebreasts. Had quite a lot of fun. Also saw a white tailed eagle fly over.
4chan doesnt post Exif data anymore but will still use the Exif properties

Still uses exif properties 
no it doesn't 
4chan logs the data, removes it and posts the image as is.
calm down Jill.
I saw a Great Horned Owl for the first time last week. It landed in the grass beside the road when I was driving. It was so big I thought it was a goose when it landed.
is that poison?
Not a bird
Herons are neat. I see them flying all the time.
At night they are like mini stealth bombers.
Yeah, they're fairly common. Just saw one the other day.
Why do you "hate" them? WHats the point of letting them bother you so much that you feel compelled to kill them? Do you have other issues?
the older and wiser I get the more Im into birds. Takes patience and focus to really notice how many different ones there are.
Yes but only if ingested
Some anglers use herons as scapegoats for fish decline
Today I saw 3 soras and some white ibis. Not pic related obviously 
Lmao that's rancher-coyote tier retardation
Went down to the lake yesterday and saw two herons performing a mating ritual. Any suggestions on an upgrade from my phone camera?
Better photo of one of them
They clean out trout. And they're assholes too. We basically have pet trout in our dammed up crick. I've seen them peck and kill lots of trout and they never eat it. It rots. Or you'll have 50 trout and you'll have 20 in your area and there will be 5 trout left if you're lucky. We have 24/7 cameras on our trout. They clean out cricks. Endangered my ass.
how do you call this thing?
cut off trouts' escape routes
blame predators for taking the easy meal you offered them
We basically have pet trout in our dammed up crick.
because im a retard im gonna kill wild animals because my small brain thinks they are "assholes"
Please dont reproduce.
The entire reason wild trout are rare in most areas and they have to stock trout for sport fishing is because of dams, and overfishing by humans. trout aren't even common prey for birds because they live in current. birds like that usually prefer stillwater shallows.
Lots of birds where I live. Great Blue Herons, Green Herons, American Bitterns, Least Bitterns, Wild Turkeys, you name it. I need to buy a cheap tripod and mounting system so I can attach my phone camera to my binoculars and get some pictures. I live right beside some wetland and ponds and I watch them hunt as I fish in my kayak. I always try to take videos with just my phone camera but it comes out shit since they're so far away.
Off the Mississippi coast
Moments before
We have natives, go to any crick and you will see falls and natural dams. Trout can easily jump up stream to spawn into the dam and above the dam where there is obviously no blockage retards
I saw a bird that looked very similar to that years ago but I've never been able to work out what it is. Does anyone what species looks like that but lives around Brisbane, Australia? It's been annoying me for years.
I should contribute more to the thread. Here's an Australasian Darter.
Royal Spoonbill.
nice shot
It's the best time for birding in my area. Spring migration, birds changing into their breeding plumage, and the trees are still bare enough to see gems like this Great Horned Owlet. Pic is from last year but I've found two nests with owlets this year as well.
most creeks, lakes, ect are not natural to start with. probably made around the 60s or 70s by the core of engineers.
somehow a vulture got to australia or you saw a bird that is thought to be extinct.
Caught pic rel on my evening walk the other day.
Fallen nest putted on closest tree
Just crop off a pixel and it'll be properly oriented
ctrl-f birds
Good thing there was a thread up!
I just went to the store and bought an Apple, I chewed off a few pieces of the peel and threw them to two crows, then thier friends arrived so I threw a few more.
I'm about to finish my coffee and go back to the crows and feed them som more apple scraps. How many times would it take until the same crows recognize me as thier fren?
Every few years I kill a crow and leave its body out as a warning to others. Fuck crows.
Look at that little homicidal tree murderer. It is clearly thinking about pounding on your eves at 5am because fuck you.
Western Red Ceder
I'm just going to assume you're canadian.
Seaside sparrow
Obviously didn't bring my DSLR but this couple was chilling right by my campsite for a good 15 minutes
Summer Tanager. What cameras do you guys use for bird photos? I just stick phone camera up to my binocular lens.

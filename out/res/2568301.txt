Behold my pepper autism
Which wild peppers should I grow
So I just let it chill and water every now and then until they make new growth?
everyone says mulberry is the damn easiest and fastest twig to root and grow
hell its even making young fruits now, but I dont want them to end up rotting like last ones
I just want a bunch of mulberry small trees, is there anyone that can tell me more info on rooting them? I think they're a popular fruit, but not here where I live yet (climate is good for them tho)
this is pic for reference
usually they have half a 5 l plastic bottle as dome above them but I heard woody cuttings dont like humidity constantly
thus far it seems one of the thicker is getting some little mold, so I did this to help
I basically rounded up my branches, cut them in a way that they had a couple nodes, cut the tip of the lower one and pulled anything like a bud so it could grow roots, I also scrubbed the end with a knife until the white pith to ease them same
plop them in the good soil compost, watered once slightly and domed it, havent watered since then as soil seemed to recycle its humidity
sorry for pic dump
2/4
3/4
4/4
it's basically spring now, so I feel the green is just coming out from inertia, because i pulled one of the less leafy ones out and didnt seem to have any roots
granted I could have torn them, dunno how frail and thin they are for mulberries, but didnt feel like that
new thread repost
sorry for being a noob. may i ask what are these blocks and how do you make them?
don't they dry out quick?
Thoughts on the feasibility of following abandoned railroad tracks and using them as a planting space for melons?
Basically melons and pumpkins just take up too much fucking space but i know where some recently abandoned railroad tracks are, so could I commandeer some land and just let some melons grow?
How's the compost coming, boys?
it's got what plants crave
my blocks are made from 4 parts sifted peat and 1 part sifted composted cow manure. You use something called a soil blocker. Takes a bit to get used to how wet it needs to be. I like them a bit wetter than most of what is on youtube.
The bigger blocks don't dry out any faster than standard 4 o 6 packs. The smaller ones do but like any gardener you just need to keep an eye on them.
50 marigold seeded
Soil blockers
very interesting, looks like an efficient way to get things started. thank you anon
just make sure you don't use old peat moss like I did doing the second batch. The blocks should look like thick mud. But with old peat they look like wet dark sawdust.
you can also do blocks with just your hand if you want, i dont like the idea of having 10.000 gadgets, i even thought of buyin an hori hori knife but i can just buy serrated knifes at a chink store if i wanted to cut through soil (darn roots)
Can anyone give me an emergency ID on this? I'm almost certain it's a mold. I'm in Kansas and it was growing on my indoor gardenia. It's had recurring issues with what I'm almost certain are spider mites which I've been dealing with by spraying it with a mixture of around 2q water, a tablespoon of vinegar, and a few drops of dish soap. I was going to repot it and saw this and immediately took it outside, now I'm concerned that something might be spreading under my nose and I have a tray of seedlings that might be affected if so.
Anyone know anything about lupines? Is there really such a variance in the hue of the colors, or do some seed sellers just photoshop the images to appear more vibrant?
Is this kind of thing any good?
That's pretty funny. What you should do is kill two birds with one stone and till your garden beds and then use all those rocks that come up as the edging.
it's just sitting in water. put a triangle of rocks or something under the pot so there's an airgap between it and the base.
Any ideas why my Chilis are reaching for the sky?
Theyre under a 100w draw full spec grow light.
I've been bottom watering, there's no perlite in their mix currently. Plan to repot once established.
I'm not so sure. And what is the stuff that looks like roe? I only water it like once a week and I've never seen overwatering mold like this before.
How many inches away from the light?
When I was ten or so my dad was ripping out a lilac bush. I planted a stalk of it cus I learned it would grow in science class.
22 years later, it is this now. I didnt start caring for it until four years ago. My grandma loved it so every spring I put flowers from it in front of her ashes. It was planted outside of her bedroom.
which variety?
leaves pointed up = they're happy and getting plenty of light
From everything I’ve read transplanting is a no-go, because of their extremely delicate roots. If it works out for you, I’m happy for you. How many plants do you intend to grow? From what I understand, papaver somniferum does best when planted in the early spring and exposed to cold, and can also endure the winter if planted in the fall and allowed to grow into a sizable rosette. Are you going to grow them ornamentally or do you intend to milk them/turn them into tea? They have a tendency to bolt which may result in multiple short pods instead of one or two tall large pods, and they need a ‘drought’ period in order to stimulate the plant to produce as much latex as possible before you harvest them.
During the COVID lockdown in 2020, I planted a bunch of daffodil bulbs in all the treepits on a major street median. The first year they all bloomed, the second year most of them bloomed, but this year it seems like half or more of them are gone.
What could have happened? Squirrels don't come here and dig up bulbs because of all the car traffic, and while pedestrians might have stepped on a few of them, it doesn't account for half of them vanishing.
Pic related; there originally was a flower/bulb on every corner. In the background you can see more blooming; you can also see that most corners are now empty. What happened?
All of them anon all of them.
Taking the farmer pill tonight, Anons! I live in an apartment so what I can do is limited but I got a grow kit for some herbs and veggies and I am soaking the soil tablets as I type this. Going to let it soak in the water overnight and will plant the seeds tomorrow morning and leave them in my windowsill.
Any advice for an urban beginner?
Does your window get plenty of sunlight? I've got a balcony but unfortunately it faces the wrong way, so it only gets sun in the latter part of the day even in summertime. Location could be a big factor if you want to grow anything that wants full sun, or you might have to take the artificial lighting pill.
Thankfully yes. I usually have to block out the light entirely during the evenings or else the sun is blinding. Works out perfect for my plants though
Your job as a gardener/farmer is to make the environment as comfortable as possible for the plants to grow their produce, not to baby them and fret over every little thing. It's OK to get attached, but plants know how to grow and if, say, you plant some peppers that are growing a little too slow, don't immediately repot in different soil and start adding all kinds of junk to the water but rather ask around and see if they just need a little more sun or a temperature change.
Some rapid-fire tips:
Good luck, anon. Remember: everyone starts with a purple thumb; it turns greener with every plant you care for.
read it could be due to hard water. should I be concerned? if so, how can I remedy it?
Any ideas why my Chilis are reaching for the sky?
You only have to worry about "legging" with plants that don't get as big like spinach and lettuce. Those are very healthy plants.
This, I don't know a lot of people that bother doing this and it's a shame. Especially if you intend on transplanting outside you should mix some of the soil it will be planted into in your seeding mix with peat moss sand or whatever else it needs. You should also rinse it out with boiling water to kill any unwanted seeds and sterilize it too. For bigger pots I just fill with mix and flood it for a few days then drain and plant. Also try to at least give the seeds filtered water for their first few watering and make sure to use room/outside temperature water so you don't shock them.
Get one of these (a cheapo one from Harbor freight, all of them fancy or not will stop working after about a year or two) and fill it with filtered water if you can and leave it in the same environment as the plants so that you'll never screw up watering them. They like to be watered like rain/mist because it doesn't disturb the soil or flood them until their crowns are destroyed. Don't rely on "reservoirs" to water it for you unless it's a pure hydroponic setup because you want fresh water to keep all the roots and soil in check and prevent mold. Don't water when the sun is beating on them, nature doesn't and the water droplets can burn holes in leaves.
As for your soil tablets...are you talking about the jiffy pellet things? Be careful as you may not have luck with some seeds because I think those are just pure peat. I personally haven't had much luck with them but I plant things that don't really need them or can't transplanted.
Anything on Baker Creek you'd recommend as stand-out and worthwhile things to grow?
Very wholesome
Snake bean and any bush bean
I planted 80 almonds last September and 47 of them came out by this spring. Average height is 22cm. In semi-arid 10a zone of the Cyclades of greece.
Any anons make wind breaks of sorts around saplings? Winds here are insane and can be 60km/hr for days. 
Dry stones (aesthetic but so much work to get it to about 30cm) or tires (ugly but ez) is what I was thinking, any other ideas?
Looks like mineral build up to me.
I don't know if this can help, you can try to dig and make a wall or plant some tall trees around your terrain
How to protect my trees from wind?
fucking hell anon...
I've separated the squash but decided to put them in a window planter for now because I was low on compost/soil and wanted to be able to bring them inside in case we get another frost (which is pretty much guaranteed). 
I hope I'll be untangle the roots when I transplant them again next month.
forgot pic
Slip a piece of card in between each plant.
Not perfect but it will help a bit with root entangling
a certain subset of the human species found it upon themselves to remove them it seems
do you know how long those seeds would last in an envelope? I have a plethora of multicolored scorpions that I forgot to plant
I once read that tulips start petering out after a few years so maybe the same holds true for daffodils?
Anon these are supposed to be the trees that are to protect against the wind later
Good idea, I think I'll do something along those lines
I'm assuming he means young trees you can buy in nurseries and not tiny sapplings like the ones you have
Does anybody else here do plant hybridizing? I've been trying out hybridizing daylilies for several years now and haven't made much progress.
As a beginner gardener focus on the basics. Learn about your plants. 
Some actual tips:
Water from the bottom. Put your pot/bucket in a dish/ pan/ whatever with water in it. Come back later and remove from water after soil is moistened. 
Feeding- Just get a balanced NPK fertilizer and follow the directions. Build the habit.
Soil- these other guys are telling you to find food dirt and make a good mix with compost and mulch and perlite. For a beginner, that's overkill and can even be detrimental. Go get some miracle grow potting mix and use that. It's fine. If you're starting in seed starting pots or cells you will need to up-pot after a few weeks. You'll be able to tell if you pop the plant out and see a ton of roots. Most things will be happy in a final home of 5 gal. Just be careful not to up-pot too quickly else you risk root rot with roots too small to keep up with the saturated soil.
Grow some plants. Enjoy yourself. Don't kill yournexperience with autism.
I believe they are colossus red / gold
Can some give me a few pointers on how to grow my soil?
Particularly interested in beneficial microorganisms.
I grew signet marigolds last year. They flower like crazy and are very drought resistant. Would recommend.
We usually just do the standard orange marigold but my brother wanted something different. We don't really grow them for us. We usually just do two big mixed wildflower gardens.
Red Noodle Beans about to pop
They were ~6inches, I've moved them to ~18inches. Also alternating with sunlight when its a bright day.
Understood, thanks both.
Have to check in on the progress soon. The snow has just melted. Last summer i built a compost heap enclosure from pallets since we have plenty of those. Might have gone overboard with a woodchipper so the heap might be a bit low on green material..
Do you mean the Bean Snake, Indian they have listed, or some other thing called a snake bean that they no longer seem to offer?
So apparently if you plant mustard and it goes to seed, you'll have mustard forever. Planted red mustard last year and now as spring warms up I have like 200-300 little red plants scattered everywhere.
What might be a dumb question. If I have an area where I have neighborhood cats shitting constantly, and I planted a bunch of catnip there, would that stop them?
Lots of brassicas are like that. I will never need to plant kale again.
you can either buy them or just pick IMOs, between this year and past i may have collected at least 4 different ones, still, here with today it hasnt rained for 50 days and we have temps of 30ºC somedays (fukken geoengineering), but when it is cold again and rainy (they did that past years to fuck up flowers from fruit/nut trees) i will pick some more
I think i am going to try that this year with broccoli
Flexiosum from what I heard is partially cold resistant I have been debating getting some of these rare seeds to grow myself as a house plant along with an Aji Charaprita. What is the most flavorful wild pepper out of this bunch/you know of anon?
so long as the ground is good enough/not too rocky/clay filled then go for it whats the worst that can happen. Best of luck to you guerilla melon patch.
what potatoes you planting anon &amp; what zone? I got my two rows of purple dream potatoes down in my community garden plot &amp; I still have a 3 to 4 pounds of fingerling potatoes to plant in containers out in front of my apartment.
I went to the baker creek tulip festival a couple of weekends ago and got to see their seed store in Mansfield MO in person and I can vouch for all their chili seeds &amp; tomato seeds and I imagine most of the seeds &amp; goods they sell are of good quality. Get yourself some prairie fire tomatoes &amp; maybe some shishito peppers is what I can recommend.
electrolytes?
Go for it but be aware that the offspring could end up more leafy and less crown-y.
I have 7 daffodil varieties in my garden
You got a problem with electrolytes?
i have 8 Rubus, more to come
seconding this
I recently expanded some of my flower beds and I dont want my neigbhours cat runing them
lol I never noticed the presidential seal on the drum before
Don't plant catnip unless you want more cats around. Instead, plant something they don't enjoy, like mints.
wtf, https://www.dreaminterpret.net/harvesting-huge-purple-sweet-potatoes
also i planted some time back vitelotte potatoes again but at home, since im not in the allotment anymore
The logic was that the catnip would set the cats up where they recognize it as a place where they don't want to poop. But your point is there that it'd just make them poop elsewhere in the yard. And attract more cats. And make them all into drug addicts. Might not be the best idea to turn my yard into a feline opium den.
Why would anyone do that? It has no resale value and it's not in anyone's way.
I'm trying to look that up but every result only seems to talk about how long the flowers last, not the plant/bulb itself. I was under the impression bulbs would grow larger every year, not die out. Anyone know?
niggers destroy needlessly for fun dipshit
I've heard of the method you use (= stick a stick in soil &amp; wait). I tried it for fun twice when I pruned my mulberries.
Some of them managed to grow leafs, even for three months, but none developed roots.
Last year my m. alba that I bought as a 'fruit plant' had fruit for the second time, and again the fruits were super tiny. This sucks :/
My parents didn't believe me that it's that bad, so I sent them pic related - bottom-right are mine, bottom-left are from another nursery tree (pendula) and top ones come from a random wild tree...
So I made some research &amp; propagated mulberry with success
This turned out most useful: >>> https://www.growingmulberry.org/propagation &lt;&lt;&lt;
What I did: in late June, when the first ripe fruits appeared, I located a bunch of mulberries (m. alba) around, taste-tested them, and chose the tastiest ones with sufficiently large fruits. 
Still in LATE JUNE, I did hardwood cutting:
- prepared a 2l plastic bottle: cut top of it and filled half of the bottle with plant soil mixed with sand. I did not drill any hole on the bottom.
- cut about 20 cm long, 1-year old branches (= those that are no longer green, but turned to wood)
- removed all leafs apart from either a small on top or 1/3 of a big leaf on top
- soaked the bottom with rooting hormone,
- stuck the cuttings in the bottle &amp; watered it
I left the bottle closed (even with loosely screwed cap) out of sunshine in a room for about 6 weeks. Then the cutting grew new leafs and I saw roots appear. 
Fast forward, now I got excessive amount of mulberries that, as all mulberries do, annoy me by suddenly popping green &amp; enlarged buds in the early spring and then waiting a month until the day is long enough to suddenly burst with leafs.
I can post some photos of how they look today if you like, but I don't have pics from the process.
Does the city mow those treepits after they're done blooming? If their foliage is removed prematurely they can't replenish depleted energy stores. What kind of soil is that? If drainage is bad then the bulbs might've simply rotted out.
yes post pics please
It's a cheap and sufficiently effective boundary for the agrotextile.
Low enough so you can mow above it.
Usually they sell it with less pins then needed to form it as you like.
Keked at the censored black areas. What are you hiding there, anon?
I'm not sure that such an end meets daffodils as well, but my tulip bulbs get eaten by grubs. I doubt Maybugs fear traffic or their grubs tell apart tulips from daffodils.
If your growing conditions are right the bulbs will divide after a couple of years. My grandfather used to dig up his tulips every autumn and overwinter them in his cellar, which was necessary in the northern Illinois climate. He'd separate the dividing bulbs when digging them up. They don't last forever but you can get a good eight to ten years out of them, and keep them going indefinitely if they're happy and divide.
that's correct about flexuosum
If you live in a place that never dips below 15F these peppers will live 30+ years and essentially become pepper trees. You need two for fruiting. Pretty rad pepper people are desperately trying to get those genes into popular pepper types and so far its been a crap shoot 
Also chirapita pepper grow a massive bush outside first and get all that sweet bark and then turn it into a bonchi(bonsai pepper) and have a ton of little snacker fruit for years and years all season
Based I want to place an order with him for his space tomatoes and some of the other oddball peppers he hocks but I have not pulled the trigger yet. The Variegated Jalapeño/Mattapeno is pretty cool though but I bet its a cunt to keep alive with all the parasitic foliage from what I heard.
Just pull the trigger that dude makes some fun crossbreeds
I'm finding info about fertilisers to be extremely confusing
There seems to be a few kinds
The first is those slow release pellets, the second is the organic liquid fertiliser made of fish or seaweed, the third is the synthetic stuff that you mix with water and the fourth is manure
Why are there so many when synthetic fertiliser seems so convenient?
I've read about manure and apparently it's easy to burn your crops with the high nitrogen
You don't use fresh manure, you need to let it compost first. I'm not an expert by any means but generally speaking I think organic fertilizer is used to improve the soil over a long period of time. Worms and other organisms in the soil break down the organic material which gradually releases nutrients that plants can use all the while also physically improving the structure of the soil which has all kinds of benefits to plant life (think of the soil as an ecosystem). Synthetic fertilizer on the other hand is used as a quick ad hoc solution, and for plants in containers that arent part of the "living soil".
I am trying to grow artichokes in a colder climate. any medichads with experience growing them have any tips.
I used up all my good compost already. I could take some from my asparagus patch but I don't want to.
that looks like something that would get covered up in a season then by a pain in the ass to take out.
i'm growing their strawberry spinach, apricot agastache, and sage this year. also planted some peas I had leftover from them. the peas are great. all of them germinated and they produce well. I would stay away from their tomatoes because they have had trouble germinating for me in the past.
I'm a complete noob living in eastern Missouri. What's a noob friendly thing to grow this summer? How do I get started?
Assuming you have a weed-free garden plot of with decent soil.
beans
Especially something like snow peas or green beans. You'll need something for them to climb up I just use two stakes with tight strings running across the stakes every 4-6 inches or so.
leafy greens
Spinach, lettuce, kale, etc. All easy to grow and can be grown in window boxes if you don't have much space.
Minimal effort to care for, extremely hardy, and produce a lot of fruit. Jalapenos are a great starting point. I water mine maybe once every 2 days assuming I get regular rainfall.
I live in north Arkansas and I have an easy time growing squash, zucchini, and cucumbers. I just planted seeds in a raised bed with Walmart top soil and watered them and got a summer of fresh veggies. They all fruited like crazy and only the cucumber was really bothered by animals. They also all three work as living mulch plants by covering the soil with cooling wide leaves. Did wonders for my okra that year.
Not a mycologist and I don't know what kind of mold but it's definitely mold you can see the mycelium branching out
I wonder what's wrong with this tomato that never grew true leaves. It is over a month old by now. I have plenty of tomatoes but i am keeping it alive because i am curious to see if it ever decides to do anything.
One of my chili plants does the same, I don't really know why.
Just like animals can birth offspring that isn't viable or even DoA, plants can produce duds.
your tomato is literally retarded
Now i know how my parents feel
Central MO bro here. Get yourself some peppers they grow really well here especially once summer kicks off. If you have the space and enjoy eating it Okra is also fairly easy to grow here.
It's funny when you're digging deeper into gardening and you think about all the weeds you pulled and realize that some of them were probably semi-rare herbs.
I'm experimenting with growing lettuce on my south facing window sill because lettuce is so damn expensive where I live.
At first they grew too leggy; clearly they didn't get enough light, so I made a light reflector out of cardboard and now they are growing fine.
My problem is the afternoon sun, it's making the lettuce all droopy and even scorches the tips of the leafs. So I installed a 5v fan to blow cooler air on them and it has worked fine for a couple of weeks but as we move further into summer the sun is only getting stronger and my lettuce has begun drooping again so now I have to babysit them every afternoon with the blinds... and I don't want to have to constantly babysit them. 
Do triple glazed windows magnify the suns heat or something? 
I tried putting shade cloth over the window but it makes it look a crackhead lives here and also I feel it blocked too much of the light when the sun wasn't directly on it.
I'm thinking of buying a clear plastic sheet, sanding one side of it to diffuse the light and putting it between the window panes, yay or nay?
They like the sun but do not like the heat.
Anyone know what this shitter plant is growing all over my property and how to best get rid of it?
South east canada
So you're saying I should develop little solar-powered air conditioners on stakes for lettuce plants?
Yeah so my problem is how to separate the light from the heat lmao.
I'll give you a (You) for the effort.
It's a joke. I've never been able to figure out how to get lettuce to not grow three inches, bolt, and then die. I feel the effort isn't worth the results when far more reliable greens exist. I may just be doing it wrong, though.
somewhat same here, i should start my winter stuff in october or so
looks like hornbeam so shouldnt be hard to get rid of, cut them down or pull them out.
I like to id weeds (and other plants) that I see in my garden or while /out/, it's cool knowing something when you see it
That's how my mulberries did look in September, once they survived being replanted to pots.
That was harsh for them, for I read that it's not that easy to propagate them, and I put four in one bottle. That's false imho.
Notice that the oldest leaf (or part of leaf) in each is all I left when I put the cuttings in bottles, all else grown later.
That's how my mulberries look now. Most of them woke and enlarging their buds and getting them green, but they are still waiting for the day to be longer...
Just like my mulberry tree that I intend to replace.
All the mulberries did look the same two weeks ago, now they stopped. In two weeks they will probably suddenly burst with leafs.
And that's similar to what I did to the cuttings – sticking them in a closed bottle with loosely fitted cap. Just keep that in shade not to boil your plants. And in warmth for mulberries.
This is lonicera caerulea (honeysuckle) that I want to propagate, and it probably does not need such a hassle.
And finally, a collage of other plants for reference. Apart from gleditsia that is also waiting for sufficent hours of daylight, most plants are already thriving with at least bursting buds, and at most fully formed leafs &amp; flowers.
Roses are red (the leafs, at least in early spring),
forget-me-nots are blue,
ohfuck aphids on apple and rose,
and some caterpillars on box, too.
It's sometimes nice to have an excuse to go and make photos of the garden…
Most of the weeds in my garden have a lengthy medical use section in a herb compendium I have.
Starting with dandelion, plantago, yarrow, mallow, nettle, greater celandine, chamomile, mint, … – all these are sold in drugstores as well as infest my lawn.
I do know it, and I still fight them ;-)
I moved into a new place just recently and need some advice. I have a screened in porch I'm growing vegetables but somehow, something is eating my seedlings whole without even a trace that they'd ever been there within a single day, often the same or next day they sprout. This seems to have happened even to a brand new pot with fresh potting soil moved to a different area of the porch. There's no slime trails or anything, so I don't think it's slugs. Any ideas on what it could be? The only thing I can think of is lizards, but I didn't think the common anoles ate sprouts.
don't know about anoles. could be mice. what sprouts are they?
No traces seems quite mysterious.
Do your sprouts disappear during the day or during the night?
Last year my savory seedlings kept disappearing, and only once they've grown bigger I learned, by looking at leftovers, that it were the cutworms that obliterated them. Cutworm is so an accurate name...
Can anyone tell me what this is? I initially thought it was a weed because of how sudden the growth was but nothing like it is nearby. I've planted various cucurbits here.
corn. easiest shit ever to grow. rapes the soil of nutrients though
Potatoes and garlic.
No, they don't touch it, which is why I planted stuff there and am trying to arrange official permission to plant more.
The soil varies from pit to pit; some are almost too rocky to dig in, others are practically muddy swamps, and there rest are somewhere in between. I'm not surprised that the bulbs didn't last in the worst of them, but I'm puzzled when some are thriving and some vanished in the same pit.
I giggled like a teenage boy.
It's range appears to be limited to Europe. Is there a NorthEast US equivalent that could be gnawing at my bulbs?
I guess I'll dig up one or two once their leave start to wither and see how the bulbs are doing.
Cherry Tomatoes are a good starter. Also, sunflowers will practically grow on their own in your area
Do you have any roommates?
Getting a consistent 50-60C in there, I can add a bucket of kitchen scraps one week and not be able to find it again the next.
Eggplant?
Looks like milkweed
Do you have a cat? Sometimes those SOBs like to eat seedlings
Guys, I think I fucked up. I started 3 full trays of seeds and when it was warm (85 degree days, full sun) I put them outside despite not needing sunlight yet since I literally just put the seeds in. They dried out pretty bad, I didn't water because the plastic covers were dripping, and I foolishly thought that they had enough, but the soil substrate was dry. 
I have them well watered now, and a few seedlings are sprouting (Maybe 2-3 tomato, a bean or two) but the vast majority of the 150 plugs are empty. 
I planted them the weekend of the 8th, it's the 19th now. Should I re-sow seeds in the trays or wait? Usually they are around 68 degrees (I do not have heated trays)
It's a lot of tomato, pepper, brassicas (Kale, collards) and herbs. Barely anything has come up.
i had a tomato plant once that only grew one baby leaf
i let the roots develop till the stem was thick then snipped the leaf off with a bit of stem
a week later true leaves had formed
I hardened off my strawberries for a week and they still have cold stress. Is one week too little?
Its nothing to worry about, its a very common mycorhizzal fungus, Leucocoprinus birnbaumii. if anything its beneficial to your soil, i would spread it around (not kidding). It likes hot, wet, dark conditions, and thrives in pots. You might get a yellow mushroom cap at some point pic related
Medi as in Mediterranean? Yeah they go dormant in the summer, prime growing season is beginning of autumn to mid-spring. Zone 10a
Any temps over 27C for longer than a week and the lettuce is fucked, accept it. Lettuce is purely winter vegetable in my area
Mice or pillbugs, put a trap out and also inspect the seedlings at night 
Yarrow is a weed?? O fuck I have planted it everywhere
Not the worst weed to have desu, and if I really need to kill it I can just turn the sprinklers off
You may want to start sowing again. This time keep them inside out of the sun and don't let them dry out. Sorry about your seedlings bro. These things happen when starting out. Guess you could keep them around for a while yet to see if any more pop up.
I'm going to sow directly over the old seeds I guess, if they pop they pop- I have a few seeds left over. Stupid mistakes, I'm not even new at this it's my third year gardening. Should have known better than to leave them out in the sun. 
Oh well, it's not too late. Still realistically 25 days out from last frost (mothers day)
pillbugs
Pillbugs eat decaying organic matter (such as half-composted fallen leafs or rotting wood). They pose no threat to living plants.
It slowly replaces grass in your lawn if it is given a chance. Just like dandelions, daisy, clover or cinquefoil: once it rooted well, you won't get rid of it unless you start the lawn anew.
Did a quick search just to check this out of curiosity. Apparently, in very wet conditions they'll eat tender plants. Live or dead, they only care about the ease of the meal.
I'd re-sow, sorry bro. My first tray this year didn't sprout as well, don't know why though. It was all chilis, mainly super hots. Had a heat mat and everything but not a single one came up. Never happened before to me.
yeah they've done a number on my direct sow beans so far. gonna try starting them indoor until theyve got a couple leafs. they'll munch the cotyledons off before the seedling is fully emerged.
This is going to sound like madness, but have you considered putting in some leaf mulch to bait them away from your live plants?
sort of. been throwing banana peels and mango skins around them to keep them busy. seems to have helped. also must have been a couple hundred of them in the bottom of a couple of the beer and yeast traps i laid out.
So what can I grow on a south facing window sill in the summer?
I put in a thermometer today and even with the fan going it maxed out at 32 C... and it's only April. It's so fucking over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0i6mnRygCc [Embed]
Yeah, the only damage they do is to very young seedlings with fleshy stems, after a couple of weeks pillbugs dont do shit, i 'feed' them with prunings and decaying leaves which they prefer over my seedlings. I've also found that smaller garden beds are usually the victims for pillbug damage, they overpopulate in the contained area and go a bit wild 
I feel like fruit skins might be too sugary, you might be breeding these things by the sound of it 
What is your latitude lmao, and local climate
use growing lights then
Don't particularly like beans.
Here.
The whole point is to grow food for free in a window I'm not using for anything else.
Zinnias popping
My guy listen, where you want to grow stuff is too hot right now. Period. If you can't drop the temperature then you're gonna struggle to grow most things not to mention fucking lettuce.
Someone already mentioned beans but some types of tomatoes, tomatillos, peppers for example are things that you can grow through the hottest of summers but that's outside, I can't say if they will survive being baked behind a window with low ventilation.
I guarantee you that your lettuce will bolt with that heat so better throw those few leafs on a sandwich before they turn bitter if they aren't already.
What soil block maker do you use?
Ladbrooke
Do you like them over plug trays? My plugs are always so soggy, I'm thinking soil blocks will allow better airflow
We've been doing soil blocks I think for 10 years or so. A few times we did plug trays but for us soil blocks overrule every other method. 
I've noticed several people on youtube that don't like them don't really know how to make the mix correctly and don't use the blocker correctly. Here is a perfect example of how not to make soil blocks. 
https://youtu.be/pDaUKPB9jas?t=257 [Embed]
as for the "having to buy this mix", you don't for a full year, we do about 600-800 plants per year its 1 bale of peat moss and 1 - 2 bags of black kow compost.
In my seed tray I'm using about half peatmoss, half soil from the garden and a sprinkling of Perlite throughout, just to evenly distribute. I have rigid plastic plug trays I reuse every year but the hard plastic keeps them soaked- if they're not soaked they dry super fast. Thinking plug trays might be good- I only do about 150-200 plants a year
What's a good trap crop for cats? If I plant a small bed of catnip/catgrass will that keep them occupied so they stop shitting in my beds? I was willing to let them have a pass but they entered into an armistice with the squirrels and now both dig and shit in my beds.
wouldn't catnip just attract more cats? be thankful for them. they are keeping the mice from eradicating your plants.
I'll take some pics later, I have some trays that need to be watered. I've noticed for myself that plug trays have always been harder to tell when to water. the top will look super dry but picking up the 6 pack the bottom is still damp.
They are already here. What? Are the 3 existing cats going to ring their friends and invite them over?
Thanks friend.
yes. do you know anything about cats?
Didn't even notice the love lies bleeding started to pop as well
oh i thought that was gonna be another name for picrel
damn thats fucking cool
unironically yes anon. If you want to plant catnip plant it a half mile to quarter mile at closest to your garden and pray the pack of wild cats that likely roams your countryside doesnt choose to take up residence close.
I'm not sure if I recommend growing alpine strawberries. They're very tasty but the fruit aren't larger than a few centimeters and their shelf life is 10 minutes...
weird lookin mushroom
so how many of you /HGM/ are using your urine as fertilizer? i think i might try doing it this season
Imagine the smell.
it would be diluted with water and the smell would fade pretty fast i imagine.
probably depends on the grower. how much goyslop you consume determines the smell
would def make pepe fertilizer stinky
So this is how I water them. I usually put my soilblocks on food trays. The food trays let the air circulate between the blocks because of the low sides as well as being easy to pour off any excess water. I usually fill the tray about 1/2 way and then watch as the blocks suck up the water. If there is excess water I just pour it off.
One piss revolution here
Hey guys, my woman and I want to start gardening, and there's been this giant patch of large weeds in my yard. My grandad would call them horn weeds but I'm not sure what the proper term is. They're tall and bamboo like, get green in the summer, die in winter, regrow from new buds in spring. 
Anyways I started pulling them out and realized they're attached to this huge root system. The roots are so big they look like tree branches. I dug as many of them out as I could, but they go under the corner fence into my neighbors yards. 
I have all the roots I can cut and exposed, what can I do to make sure they don't come back? My grandad would salt the roots of plants he didn't coming back. Do I do that and rebury in a few days? Something else?
salting your land is a terrible idea. you just need to be diligent. hoe what you can. dig what you can't. preparing a garden is a lot of work.
What is it like to actually live in a place where it rains regularly? Especially during the summer
how regular? once a week? once a day? how often does it rain where you live?
how regular?
Once a week to once every two weeks? That's regular in places right?
lol
do you live in california or something? why?
My stupid ass wrongly assumed my young fruit shrubs would be protected by the sheer amount of snow that fell on them before shoveling more of it on top and now they have a bunch of broken canes.
How often do you water?
Usually rains twice a week here and it's fine.
Broken canes, you say? Have you considered rooting them and starting new plants?
I'm very much a babby-level gardener but I guess I can always try
What kind of plants, specifically? Generally you clean the break, then bury it in a light potting mix so a few of the leafing nodes are covered. If it's leafing, either clip the bottom leaves or snip the existing leaves in half to reduce the resource demand on the plant. Avoid the plant being wet. If you have rooting hormone, you can always take your shot with that. If you have access to willow, you can always try making your own rooting tea by steeping a snip.
There's a mix of several things but I think I'm gonna focus on blackberries and raspberries. I do know at least blackberry grows like it's on a mission to conquer the earth
You're a idiot. Someone should salt the soil around your family tree. Salting the earth will make almost all plants now grow. And it takes years and years for the soil to recover.
rate my seed haul
1 of 2
2 of 2
sweden zone 4, i think its equivalent to 6a in us zone system
planting mostly marabel and cherie plus some earlier variants i dont remember and a few late firm taters of unknown kind
also some spooky violet queen for halloween
two more weeks™ and theyre going in the earth
did you already buy, and chit your potatoes?
Wtf? Too hot in southern Sweden for lettuce? Are you retarded or american?
I still don't know if the dexamphetamine in my piss would speed up growth or do some other weird things. So so far I've just emptied my piss jugs out of the window
depends on how fast they dry out. I think these went two days before needing to be watered. The mini blocks sometimes daily.
ive got most from last years harvest, others ive bought
already sprouting and looking good under the kitchen table
might post pictures if i remember
lots more popping this morning. Peas, beans, more tomatoes and flowers
Salting asparagus beds is common practice for weed suppression. 
Try glyphosate
NTA, but I started looking into this because I found a cherry tomato seesling at Walmart and wanted it. Now I bought some seeds of other things, and I'm looking around for how big the planter boxes should be that I'm going to build. You say most things are happy in a 5 gallon bucket, but everywhere says tomatoes need 18-24 inches of depth in an 18 in diameter container, or about a 20 gal pot. Other places say 5 gal containers should be fine. What's the deal? Do I really need a fuck huge pot for my tomatoes? The container really isn't the issue, it's the soil to fill the damn thing. Am I getting to autistic with this?
Remember, gentle-rooted ground cover plants are your friend.
You can grow tomato in a 1-2gal peat moss block if you have automated irrigation
cozy, adds some variablity to the weather which makes days feel different
I've lived in dry and more rain having places and I like the rain having a bit more
it's awesome when it rains at night, and there's sun during the day, you get the best of both worlds
however there's always the risk of rain messing a holiday or stuff like that
The one thing I'm concerned about with soil brick makers is the compression of the medium. How hard does it make the bricks in order to keep them in shape?
no issues. Just be careful the first day or so after you make them and a few hours after watering. Once they start to fill with roots which is very quickly they can be handled no problem. Obviously don't play baseball with them. 
This is one day since they started to pop
fyi I just watered all of them so I probably should wait a bit more. I'll make a vid later once they dry a bit.
I wanna grow berry bushes and I live in the sticks but there's shockingly few birds and bugs here. Should I just stick to self-fertile ones?
Many berry bushes are listed as being self-fertile, but you still want the cross-over for optimal fruiting. That noted, if you start planting things, you'll get pollinator insects. Can always co-plant some other flowering plants to bait pollinators if that doesn't work.
Where the fuck do you live where there's no bugs?
I don't, I'm just a retard with some plywood for boxes, a deck to put them on, and a tomato plant I bought from Walmart.
I was going to try to post something funny using "automated irrigation," so I asked ChatGPT to give me a joke or response, it gave me some Reddit shit, I told it to make one that I could post on 4chan, and it said "Automated irrigation sounds like a conspiracy by the government to control the water supply and turn us all into mindless plant zombies." and "Automated irrigation sounds like something that would make my ex-girlfriend jealous - at least now I can give my plants the consistent attention and care she never got from me."
How can soil blocks be draining but not fall apart? Everytime my soil was too condensed the germination rate was shit.
no idea why you're having trouble with slightly condensed soil...
how can such a small block of soil support such gigantic plant?
I literally have no idea, all I know is that they work. My blocking mix is just 4 parts peat and 1 part black kow. Once the cotyledons start getting the purple spots I start feeding 1/2 strength GH flora nova grow until they are out of the seedling stage. I do that once per week until they are hardened off outside then start using full strength fish emulsion. It just works for me.
there was so much wrong with the Hoss tools guy. Didn't use enough water, didn't compress the blocks enough and just sounded like an overall douchebag
On another hard drive I have a video that an anon shared here one time. The way he did it, the soil was so saturated with water, that the blocks were floppy, almost falling apart on their own, kind of like a soft cake or something
that was me. If you watch it again I say to make sure you are careful with them during the first few hours. I'll make a vid later showing that they don't just fall apart. 
I'm not using concrete dust in my mix lol, they just stay together for months.
I changed my daily commute so I can go gawk at the local plant nursery setting up for the season
it WAS you, I remember your trays, lol
Yep, lol. I think I may actually stop using the 1020 trays and just go with more smooth bottom lunch trays. So I think the confusion with a lot of people looking at Soilblocks is not realizing that the compost for compost a cow manure is the binding part of it. So it almost locks the stuff together but in the beginning, you still have to be careful because as you saw my video, you can just smash them with your hands. So usually what I’ll do is make a couple trays of soil blocks, and then that day I will seed all of them and then just let them sit in the grow tent until they sprout. I may have to mist the tops a few times but once they sprout and the roots start going through the soil block, they become very sturdy.
“that the compost or composted cow manure”
It's so fucking over
May the homes of the officials who authorized this get struck by the fiercest earthquake known to man
May they dig through the rubble with their nails to even get enough air to draw their final breath
doesnt the roots sticking out like that cause them to "burn off"? isnt that how air pruning works?
That shit would make my blood boil. Are they at least compensating you?
Yup, they pretty much just die off and the roots inside the block branch off more. Here is one of my peppers from last year. Inside the block is a mass of roots the explode out when planted
I'm angry. This really pisses me off. What the fuck. You better be well compensated, but even that doesn't replace your land and hard work. Fuck.
Yes I'm getting compensated but the real problem is that I'll have to find new land to buy, and since I'm in Europe it's pretty hard to find, especially considering my current land is in a pretty nice spot.
Another pic. 
Not sure how much is still left in the ground as I usually leave them over the winter and pull them in early April
I'm the anon asking about containers for tomatoes above. I'm trying to make containrrs so I can grow on my deck and the concrete half of my backyard (previous owner thought a basketball hoop was necessary in a tiny backyard). How deep do the containers need to be, and how close together can I plant this stuff? I've got tomaties, peppers, onions, lettuce, and I want to get a rasbperry bush. I can find general guidelines in places for things like depth, but widely varying info. Some places say tomatoes need 24" of depth, others only say 12". I also can't really find information on how close together to sow this stuff. Any help would be appreciated, or ecen pointing to where I can learn this stuff myself. The pastebin in the OP waa helpful for some stuff, but basic shit like this I couldn't find.
Also, what's stopping me from hust digging a hole in my yard and planting a seed? Is there any reason not to do that?
Urgh. I started my peppers and tomatoes on march 5th in a greenhouse; they’re under humidity domes and on heat mats. I’ve gotten exactly 5 seeds to germinate. Getting kind of worried; I used potting soil in 2.5” pots. Should I start over with seedling mix? 
Why aren’t these mofos sprouting?!
Bad seeds? Maybe they where too old?
Hard to say, they were envelopes from this year. Is potting mix too heavy for those seeds generally? 
I’m a newbie gardener so pardon the naivety
Some asshole has dug up 2 of my garlic cloves. What is the hottest pepper that I can buy in powdered form to spread on my soil?
Galapagos peppers came in
looks like I have a new forever indoor pepper to start (too late in the season to put out)
Get kebab skewers and plant them in the soil with your plants, like a punji pit
When the squirrels dig up your shit they'll stab their hands on it and fuck off
it's all so tiresome
put the two garlic cloves a knuckle back in you nozzle!
Tasty salad/10
got some old cuke starts that are blooming already but the vine is only a few inches long with a couple quarter sized leaves. would it be wise to pick the blooms and immature cukes until they've grown a bit taller or litfa?
I would soak them for 1/2 a day and throw them in a paper towel inside of a zip lock bag. Will probably get them to pop in a few days. Throw that shit in some soft warm peat and hit it hard wit heat and light. Will be going good in a week.
yup pinch them off as the plant grows for several weeks.
A thought. If I have a bunch of hummingbird-friendly flowers planted but don't have something screaming red to draw them in, could I fake the color element using something like a cherry tomato plant?
I know people who use fake flowers, but I've not heard of tomatoes working for this. Try it and let us know?
What you need for your tomatoes depends on what variety they are. Determinate cherry toms don't need near as much as an indeterminate big beefsteak variety, for example.
If you want to use smaller pots for bigger tomatoes, you'll probably have to prune the tomato to inhibit growth and force it to focus all its nutrients on growing a set amount of fruit.
As for the depth of the tomato, it's because the stem can grow roots. Burying more of the stem means more roots to uptake nutrients but it doesn't have to be buried deep, it can just be buried at an angle, or even horizontally.
That's pretty awesome
I don't actually know why lol
One thing is sure, my currants, Gundermann, and dead-nettles love my compost.
I have a dilemma. I intend to grow in pots with give or take 60% potting soil and 40% cocos peat, and a bit of perlite.
Is it neccecery to supplement with magnesium or is that not needed?
Very nice! I have some berry bushes too, should I use fertilizer?
Suppose i'll just give it a go and get epsom salt from the store. I read cocos needs cal/mag supplement. I have some chalk already, but i have no idea if there's magnesium in there, i think not.
How fucked am I
Depends on the plant. Look at the days to sprout and days to maturity on your packets and plant what you have time for until you frost frost in the fall
Thanks man.
Depends the type of tomato. But 5 gal should be OK. 
If you're in containers make sure you're using determinate varieties of tomatoes for best results. As another anon was saying, not in response to this post, bury the stem for root production. Good luck!
any suggestions on what? Season is reasonably long, I know I can get away with growing into November with some careful attention even though I think final frost is like end of October
Really wanted to try and get some good tomatoes this year but I just totally dropped the ball
if you can't tell I'm stupid new to this by the way, I did a few nursey plants and wanted to do a full in ground garden this year because my harvest was shit last year kek
The climate where I live is fucking retarded. Like yesterday it was hotter than where I used to live in the middle east, and now its nice and cool after a hardcore thunderstorm came through. As a result, I've had a rough time growing shit. Seriously considering setting up a significant indoor growing situation. Only thing is, some of the things I want to grow are huge, like watermelons. Probably would need to illuminate the entire room with grow lights, in order to hit all the vines.
I feel that. A week ago it wqs 90 degrees and tomorrow we've got a freeze warning. I'm just glad I've been a shithead and been putting off transplanting my shit outskde
For tomatoes, you'll probably have to go nursery again this year, you usually want them to be a couple months old when you transplant them.
Zucchini, squash, most herbs, potatoes, onions, and beans should be alright to start from seed right around now, though.
Was just rewatching a video. 
For people interested in trying soilblocking, this is a great video but it does not have to be as intensive as this video. You really don't have to add all the amendments but watching this again I might start trying blood meal. 
https://youtu.be/EQueN2ZPitY?t=76 [Embed]
I'm not sure? I just put on an inch layer of compost on my "beds"
Well I guess I can still start all my seeds and see what happens. I may just pick up a nursey tomato and see what happens. The weather here is pretty weird sometimes (5B). I haven't even cleared the land I need to anyways so I'm under the gun but worst that happens is my tomatoes just don't have it and I try again the following year. Cheers
You should be okay starting your tomatoes now. They'll be a little small but they grow fast. US 5b here too. Friend of mine transplanted his tomatoes mid june and had a great year. If you plant seeds today, they will be a month old by memorial day and perfect for planting. "A couple months" can be too long for tomatoes indoors. I started mine at the beginning of March and I've had to pot up to 6" pots because they go root bound so quickly. Better a little late rhan early.
Tomatoes aren't as bad with transplant shock, I've successfully transplanted big ass tomatoes from a 1.5 gallon pot.
They were cuttings from a previous year kept over winter, so they had like 5 months of growth. It's not a huge deal if they get huge because you underestimated how fast they grow, just transplant them to a bigger pot like you did and prune and bury the stem when you transplant them. 
That said, I don't think he should start any beefsteaks right now if he might have to pull the plug in October. Beefsteaks can take like 3 months to set their first fruit and another 3 to ripen it. A slightly early frost would be just in time to fuck it all up right before it ripens. 
Cherries and sauce tomatoes would probably be fine, but nursery would probably produce fruit from late May and all through till cold hits while from seed probably wouldn't start to produce until late July/early August.
I think I'll do both. Start some tomatoes this weekend, I'll transplant some nursery tomatoes in a few weeks as well and see what happens. Cheers guys. What a shame I started so late, life just got away from me last few months.
Get the fuck out of Minnesota
love me some mini sodas
that bad there too? no I'm in SE TX
Well my diy mini block trays work great. 40 arugula for my bro going in here
So I guess you can make soil blocks by hand though I could easily do 8 blocks in the time it took me to squeeze the handmade one to the correct moisture.
¿are u a moor ?
Just learned that strawberries apparently dont produce fruit in their first year. Is this also true for alpines?
I live in zone 6a and had some serious damping off issues last year (and I'm carefully trying to avoid that again). I literally was planting as late as June, and was able to harvest beans, peas, okra, beets, radishes, spicy peppers, and even some corn, very very late in the season. Obviously I made some mistakes and I could've done better, but I managed to salvage the remaining time left and made a pretty decent comeback.
I planted two weeks ago and things are looking good. As long as they stay good and I work for it, I'm expecting a good year. [spoiler] I just want my tomato seedlings to grow faster, the warm days are few and far between [/spoiler].
welp
What's a good edible, cold-hardy ground cover that won't form an impenetrable mat of roots?
best methods to deal with indoor aphids on pepper plants? I ve tried soap but that just seems to kill the peppers while the aphids keep growing in number.
very tasty
they have this very parfumy tasty that i dont like over regular classical strawberry flavor of other varieties
fruit aren't larger than a few centimeters
more like 1.5 lol, they are 1-2 grams regularly, mara de bois taste like alpine with an additional aftertaste that is like a strawberry-cream candy i ate sometimes as a kid
kinda, i dried one once that had fragance and it didnt taste when i ate it
i think more like it is recommended to pinch the flowers to promote vegetative growth, young runners fruited for me certainly
Started setting up a previously unused part of the plot and I have a few spots I think would be good for berry bushes but I'm not sure if I should grow raspberries or currants.
Which one do you prefer /hgm/
Mahonia aquifolium
produced fruit for me in the first year
It's long bean planting temperature in 9B now boys
1. Harvesting: red/white currants ripen throughput July, black slightly later. Raspberries ripen from August until winter. So, when would you like your fruits?
2. Maintenance: raspberries spread like weeds. Apart from this, you cut them once a year at ground level. Currants yield better when pruned once a year, but can do without.
3. Pest / diseases: currents are usually demolished by aphids. If it's severe (and currants usually gets overwhelmed twice a year by aphids), you need intervene. I've not seen any other serious pest/disease threatening my currants. Raspberries usually are healthy enough to leave them be. (Both raspberries or currants have a number of other pest that damage them, including butterflies larvae that eat the stems from inside out, but none of these are serious concern.)
4. Soil / sun / water: similar requirements. Both like sun. Currants fancy wetter soil than raspberries. Both will succeed almost on any soil.
5. Required space: red/white currant (unpruned) grows up to to 3m in diameter and up to 1.5m tall. Single raspberry uses up to 0.5m diameter and grows 1.5m tall as well, multiple are grown more densely than that.
I'd rather have white currant, red currant and raspberries at the same time ;-)
(Propagating: raspberries copy themselves by shooting new raspberries from roots, currents are easily propagated by layering and cuttings.)
Allotment going well. Pretty sure there's an ant nest in the compost which I don't think is harmful. Lots of pests in there since I added a load of cardboard, got woodlice about 3cm long.
Looks like you need a lot more carbon in there 
I compost using straw and it just blazes through my food scraps a bucket only lasts like a month in there before it disintegrates to dirt
I don't mean to start comparing g-penis sizes but at what point do you think a typical kitchen garden turns into more of an urban homestead?
Can someone explain NPK ratios to a noob? Why are some like 20-20-20 and others 3-2-5 etc.? Is the latter just really weak fertilizer?
I'm not growing weed
No, am anglo
Yes. But some will say eg “contents: 50% of 20-20-20, water” which means it’s actually 10-10-10.
You have to dilute it anyway and weaker ones (e.g. 3-2-5) may be easier to mix if you need only a small quantity
Amateur here, I have this pepper plant (explosive ember) in a kratky pot. It used to give me like 5 new flowers every week for the last 3 months, but over last few weeks no new flowers have appeared. Temperature and feeding havent changed and it doesn’t look unhealthy. Will it just go and flower again in a few months? Because if it won’t I’ll harvest the entire plant and put something new
nice thanks for the breakdown anonymoose
It will put out flowers again you just need to harvest all the peppers &amp; then give it some phosphorus &amp; potassium after harvesting and it will throw out a new set of flowers. Once chili plants detected they are at or close to maximum pepper load they stop putting out flowers/drop any remaining flowers to focus on growing the chilis.
Thank you anon, will do exactly that then. I’ll wait till they’re all mature, harvest, and give the nutrients. In the meantime its just looking for a good hot sauce recipe, these boys are pretty tasty
Overgrown garden I wanna convert for some veggies. What's the best way to clear off all this shit? The bushes can stay but the rest needs to go. 
After I clear it off then what? Do I need to put new soil down? Do I just add fertilizer? This will be my first time doing an in ground garden since I was younger so I'm lost. I'm basically starting late from seeds to getting this ready kek but hope to have plans in the ground no later than end of may.
I would start with getting some trash bags and gloves, pull out the dead plants, get a rake or a shovel and start filling up those bags.
Maybe throw some fertilizer and water thoroughly, best to keep to the instructions and not throw too much, despite how dead all of it looks
How do I make compost?
I have a bunch of lawn clippings I can start with...
Hm... I can't tell whether you're trolling or not, so let me reveal this secret to you:
you just pile your lawn clippings and wait.
If you want to speed up the process:
1) surround the pile with walls (of any kind) - digging a pit &amp; throwing all inside works, fancy plastic boxes with no bottom are fancy, classy stone/brick walls are classy
2) keep the pile moist and warm
3) add super-duper bacteria for a bazillion of dollars as seen on tv etc.
I guess I will ask here.

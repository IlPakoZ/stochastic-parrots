Analog life is the only way to scape the matrix 
I already scape all social media I am only in anonymous places but still this is the matrix 
Going /out/ I actualy feel like a human beeing, talk real stuff, do real things, experience real life, improve for real.
Analog life shields you from the matrix (internet)
40% of the internet are bots, only 60% are ppl and most of the ppl are just NPCs as well ... 
the internet is not real and everything we see there is a hoax, ppl need to start outing more and more so they can scape the matrix 
go out with friends
go eat a icecream
go to a watterfall or a lake to swim
go make a fire at night 
go look at the sky
go practice fighting and music and art
go eat actual food 
etc etc everythign related to the internet or the digital realm is a scam
shameless bump
Holy fuck. sugar cereal really did a number on zoomers. really affected their mental development.
You know it is true, social engineering, political propaganda, materialism etc etc have gone too far with the internet, no one can actualy go through the process of life properly not even relate to other ppl and build healthy relationships
beeing
talk real stuff
do real things
go eat a icecream
watterfall
It's my life, whatever I wanna do
It's my life, wherever I wanna go
It's my life, whom I wanna love, uh-oh
It's my life, whatever I wanna talk
t's my life, wherever I wanna walk
It's my life, whom I wanna leave, uh-oh, oh, oh, >>oh-oh-oh
the actual way out of the matrix is taking psychedelic plants like marijuana, psilocybin and amanita mushrooms, peyote cactus, ayahuasca and various others that are less well known

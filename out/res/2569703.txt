Was thinking a single shot break action 12 gauge, then buying a bunch of caliber adapter sleeves to add in a bunch of flexibility but I am open to suggestions
rather have a coach gun. two barrels instead of one and around the same weight because the barrels are shorter.
no point in adapter sleeves. just stick to 12ga and shoot mini shells if you want lighter loads.
try putting your boots on and going outdoors first or go back to your containment board >>>/k/
Really depends where you live homie..
I grew up in florida- Where thick palm and boar hunting is pretty much all you do.. so you need a bush gun, something that's got a subsonic round but is heavy as fuck, 12gauge slug/ 45/70.. I went with 12gauge cause cheap as fuck.
went with a benelli ultralight. Best fucking shotgun I have ever held and shot. fuck its actually beyond my skill of shooting quick and hitting the target reliably at the speed it can shoot, I can fire it stupid fast- but wont hit shit consistently. you should see the thing, it'd make most benelli owners cry. It's got dents, and scrapes. well used by me and have carried it in over 35 states.
only gripe is lack of mods- especially for a bigger tube. short of taking it to a gunsmith to get a custom tube made. [maybe one day] 
Oh and the carbon fiber sight rail- kinda gimminky and i'm honestly surprised I have not broken that shit in half yet.
you seem upset
Sounds retarded. I've never had the urge to suddenly load up some .22 halfway through a hunting trip or change to 9mm or whatever the fuck you're imagining. If I wanted a .22 or a 9mm I would've grabbed it from the safe when I left to go /out/. 
My /out/ gun is a p365 for the unlikely event I encounter a nigger in the woods and either a repro Model 1886 or a Benelli Montefeltro if I'm hunting. You don't need a generic /out/ gun, you need a hunting rifle or a self defense pistol or some other firearm that fulfills a purpose. A gun isn't some talisman that you carry for no reason.
Of course you should get a single shot shotgun, and your picrel, the Henry, would be the only one worth buying new unless you find a nice old Stevens. But first, a quick rundown of when and where a single shot shines: 
1) Upland game including turkey. A single shot is light and fast handling, qualities you want when walking miles of forests, meadows, mountains, or desert scrub hunting for quail, grouse, or woodcock. 
2) Rabbit and squirrel hunting is also more enjoyable with a single shot. You can almost always stalk close enough to get a good first shot; multiple shots are rare. 
3) Turkey hunting also rarely requires a second shot. 
So if you foresee a lot of walking while hunting small game and upland game, a single shot shotgun makes sense. It can also be used for dove and pheasant but there'll be more missed birds with the first shot, so a pump/auto makes more sense here. Both 12 and 20 gauge are sufficient for upland and small game but 12 gauge shells are less expensive. Be sure to buy an improved or full choke tube when you get the gun. Read about choke tubes and which one you'll need for your situation. Henry sells choke tubes for their single shot.
Forget cartridge adapters, they suck. If you want to shoot 22 or whatever just buy another firearm. A single shot shotgun is for hunting only.
there's no reason to not bring a gun everywhere you go
avatarfagging is against the rules, europoor
get an over and under if you want multiple calibers. .22 20ga Combination guns are decent for small game
No need for multiple calibers, just get an o/u. I have a Beretta 687, love it. Picked it up with my stimmies.
I’d have to agree, a savage model 42 is quite cheap if you’re ok with looking at one of God’s abominations right in the eyes.
The best /out/ gun depends on your unique situation, and no single firearm is a "do all". In general, if you're long distance backpacking you want a subcompact pistol for defense in town, and if you're elk hunting you need a rifle. As far as single shot shotguns go they're a pretty niche firearm but I did read an account of three men who traversed the Great Basin on foot in the mid-1800s armed with only one shotgun, a single shot muzzleloader. Luckily, they didn't encounter hostile natives or they would've been scalped. 
Nowadays, we don't have to worry about starving in the wilderness or fighting indians or even grizzly bears, but there's no end to the number and type of people who will harm you. Since lugging around an AR-15 is more trouble than it's worth at the moment, a decent handgun capable of reliably hitting and killing a human at 100 yards is probably the best bet for an /out/ firearm. You'll need to rely more on your wits than the gun to get out of a jam, so don't go looking for trouble. Trouble will find you, it's right outside your front door.
i kinda like the m6 survival rifles, maybe a double gun i right for me
Get a handgun. Unless you're hiking in Africa, there's nothing out there that's worth carrying a long gun for, unless you're specifically going hunting. Look up kit guns.
Nothin personnel /in/cel
This gun looks like it should be consuming mini-shells instead.
You're not going to need more than a glock.
AR-7, Eugene Stoners pilot survival rifle
Just take literally anything else.
Don’t listen to this nigger I’ve had that gun for a little over 5 years now and have no complaints. Any problems I’ve had with it I can say comes down to human error. The worst part would be the mag release placement, if you’re running gloves you can accidentally drop the mag while shooting. Otherwise it’s a tack driver.
shop smart
shop s-mart
Depends where im at, if theres bears .10mm or bigger, if theres not i bring my 9mm
Rules are for commies
hope you shaved the sight off the 10mm. gonna be a lot easier to remove it from your ass that way, when the bear takes it away from you and shoves it up your ass.
I heard a boomer hippie say this once unironically
I've never heard this one before. You should be a standup comic!
AR7 sucks ass. Shitty sights, trigger, sinks more than it floats. A break down 10/22 is superior.
neat
Why would a bear take his gun away?
to go rob the footlocker/liquor store/gas station
1 cm is best mm.
Not pictured, longer ported barrel and some hot hardcast rounds. 
Comfy
The thing I like about the 10mm is that I can load it with weak ammo for humans or Underwood 200 grain hardcast for whatever. Last year while hiking a fucking big ass bull with horns was in my way. I would've felt undergunned with a 9mm. We came to an amicable agreement: if he lets me pass I won't kill him.
You're brave, I would have done a 360 and went the other way.
The 10 is better on sound too, 9mm makes a little pop and the 10 makes a solid BOOM. 
If Ruger would make their PC carbine in 10mm I'd get one right away.
It depends completely on what you are hunting or using your rifle for.
Here is a solid loadout for hogs:
Picrel is an example of a 308 / 7.62 NATO AR-10 build.
Hard reset trigger or NFA full auto conversion for burst fire.
Optics and suppressor of choice, AP rounds if the hog has level IV plates.
2-3x 30 round mags jungle taped to the rifle, extra mags concealed or carried.
If your extra ammo is taped to your rifle, you don't need to carry it on your person.
If you need to carry ammo on your person, you can use your pockets or conceal it.
But if you are going full auto night hunting, can get a cheap minimalist rig for like four extra mags.
You might be able to conceal a chest rig or plates under a shirt or jacket, but only mags look like hunting gear.
Ruger could, and it was speculated that they would, but the blowback design would require a much heavier weight than the 9mm, and that gun weighs 6.8 pounds.
Pretty soon hogs will have explosive reactive armor and then what we gonna do?
Whats the best gun to kill this nigger.
Makes sense. I have the PC9, it somewhat makes up for the weak round by putting a lot of lead on target. It's so easy with a red dot it makes people think they're some kind of great shooter.
Love the break-down guns, need a pistol caliber (.357) lever action breakdown to round out the collection. Henry or Chiappa or ?, idk. I don't like that matte chrome finish Chiappa uses but stainless would be ok. Haven't looked in a while to see what's out there.
Big fuck gay.
Lightweight AR15 build, for example 450 bushmaster (good for big and dangerous game) upper and mags for big game and defense, 22lr upper and mags for small (most uppers weigh about 2-3lbs). There's also adapters that allow you to swap a barrel and caliber rather than the entire upper with a simple button push as long as the calibers use the same bolt (such as .223 and .300blk/.300HAMR), and .223 can be hot loaded (55gr @ 3200fps 16") or down loaded to make it a glorified 22lr (55gr @ 1000 fps). Otherwise any 12ga.
Pilot here.
Never used this gun so I have no opinion.
[spoiler]But seriously, a short pump shotgun is what I'd take. Tons of options and reliability/versatility is through the ceiling[/spoiler]
Probably a brown Bess if you’re not a faggot
20 inch ar15
This. A pump shotgun is about the best gat for a first-time buyer. Versatility and reliability are awesome. Caliber adapter sleeves are hard to zero, and you might as well just buy a new gun at that point.
After that, it depends on priorities. Hunting large game? Bolt action rifle in a .30 cal cartridge. Hunting small game? .22 rifle or birdshot with the aforementioned shotty. Bear defense? Large-caliber double-action revolver. Larping? >>2573800.
Advanced answer that is too complicated to get right for a first-time buyer. Very versatile tho.
I agree that a pump shotgun is exceptionally versatile and reliable, and if in an emergency I had to parachute out of an airplane into the Canadian or Alaskan wilderness (or any other place with griz or polar bears) it would be my first choice. Every other legitimate survival scenario is factor dependent. Even in the most griz infested wilderness in the lower 48 I'd seriously consider a handgun simply because I should be able to hike out in a few days, and light is right when hiking out to safety and a pizza. 
Contrived survival scenarios such as hiking into the backcountry to live off the land would require studying up on the available game and choosing the right gun for that time of year, keeping in mind that game wardens, legit hunters, and random people will also be in the area. Consider the legal consequences before violating laws. 
If I seriously thought that I'd have to shoot at a human to survive, I'd take a ar15 and at least three full mags. This is my go to firearm when car camping in places like the Great Basin or Arizona. If I'm just out for a hike in the national forest or blm I'll take a handgun and keep it concealed.
S&amp;W 500 with Daedric rounds
Remington Rolling Block.
Good shit, although the medium trigger is uncomfortable according to some people
No.
What do you want the gun for? Protection from dangerous animals/serial killers? What kind of dangerous animals? Bears, snakes, pigs? Is it for hunting? Hunting what? Just for plinking?
Scout rifles are intended as /out/ rifles. A guy named Jeff Cooper has lots of material on them.
I have a leopard skin that my grandad killed way back in Rhodesia. It was amazing and then it had to be fumigated by customs to get it into my country in the 80s and now it its fucked as all fuck. Cunts.
Scout rifle concept is dumb and is a relic of a time before quick detach scopes were common place a normal rifle with irons and a regular eye relief scope is superior in every way.
62 cal smoothbore fusil and/or a 75cal brownbess.
You can shoot shot, buck and ball or round ball. Accuracy after 75-100 yards is questionable however but versatility is best. 
The 62 is equivalent to a 20guage shotgun bore diameter while the 72 is closer to 12 guage. A pound of blackpowder is like $30 and I get well over 100 shots out of that pound and lead for balls I scrounge from lead wheel weights, car batteries, and old lead pipe. Its cheap. 
Nobody questions you when you are wearing buckskins, and dressed like it 1790. That and an old blackpowder gun seems far less intimidating. Or if they do they are curious about your set up and history.
Rossi makes a very affordable one shot .410 which is completely do able for your needs.
I like it. Its light and short, i dont eve realize its there.
I haven't been to /out/ since 2014, but it seems nothing's changed. Just the same threads and replies on repeat for a decade like a broken machine.
I live in the Cushington valley North of Basidium city near the Rockies. i paid 1200 dollars for my trusty Griddentop Bearstriker 45'. this sucker brought down even the most ferocious wild Muhamawk bears. i can absolutely recommend for /out/ anons
For me it's a close tie three way between a side-by-side shotgun, a 10/22 and a large calibre handgun. They all have their perks and it depends on your goals. 
For self defence, a shotgun obviously has the stopping power. But if you're bushwhacking, a long gun can be clumsy and difficult to handle, not ideal for tight quarters. Good luck shooting a mountain lion or bear with a shotgun when its already on top of you. In many places, a sidearm is basically mandatory for folks that live/work in parks with big game. 10mm, .44 or .357. 
Honourable mention is something like a bush gun, a lever action in 45-70 or some such. But that's sort of overkill in my opinion. Would certainly have a good chance of stopping a charging moose or brown bear. But it has the same limitations as a shotgun. 
And I include .22lr just because it's lightweight and perfect for small game. If self defence isn't a concern, a 22 will do most jobs just fine.
This is probably the most boring ar build I have ever ever seen
Kel-Tec Sub2000 is basically the grownup version. That, or an M6.
retarded take
everyone I know with an AR7 absolutely hates it as it's a giant piece of shit, but the sub2000 does not make a good survival gun as its a pcc
the big problem with pcc is the ammo is way too heavy to carry a significant amount of it.
.223 weighs less than 9mm, and its a better hunting round
At least there's no carry handle
Retarded. Literally no benefit over a pumpy or lever action if you want to LARP beyond a little weight saving. If you need chokes for some reason a SxS is a better choice.

What are your plans for summer?
randomly beating the shit out of hikers
taking my new kayak out
doing more shipwreck dives
getting a new hardtail mountain bike
possibly moving closer to the mountains
Kayak more.
Fly fish (trout).
Grow veggies. 
Forage for berries.
more beaches while i wait for the bugs to die off
Don't worry about it.
I know what you did last summer.
No bag limit on hogs down here.
I will be spending a lot of time outside with my rifle.
Absolutely laying full auto waste on the hog population.
This is technically work but it just makes me smile.
The feral swine are destroying the environment.
And I don't leave behind my shell casings.
Can make some decent money this season.
Will also be making a lot of pulled pork BBQ.
They get lazy in the Summer, lots of laying around.
You will find them hanging out near water to drink and stay cool.

Kicking things off with a Smith river float in a couple weeks. Playing it by ear after that.
How's the meat on those things? Isn't it full of parasites?
thats killer. I have always wanted to do that. fishing probably wont be great because of runoff but still....enjoy!
getting into crayfish trapping to kill and eat invasive species
more canoeing
more tarp camping
visit more natural landmarks
put more effort into my /out/ cooking
get into harpoon hunting/ get back into diving
Do more multi-day hikes, explore more new caves, learn trad climbing
getting into crayfish trapping to kill and eat invasive species
based, I’ve eaten hundreds of signal crayfish the last couple years (invasive here in Scandinavia)
Thanks. It'll be my 4th time, and we're definitely expecting it to be ripping given the forecast next week and the snowpack.
It's just pork, they interbreed with domestic pigs.
As long as you treat and inspect it properly, it's like slaughtering a farm pig.
Wild boar is not native to the Americas, it's an invasive species from the old world.
Europeans consider wild boar to be a gourmet meat, because you have a leaner more muscly hog fed on a wild diet with nut and berry flavors in it. Especially if it is salted and cured artisinal ham like Jamón. Back in the frontier days, salted boar was very common food for homesteaders and the like.
Pork BBQ is the specialty down here in the Southeast, and I am personally a big fan of pulled pork, pork ribs, bacon, and pork chops. However, a lot of people are not allowed to eat pork. Either way, the feral swine population is causing millions in agricultural damage and harming the environment, people will pay you to just remove the hogs much like coyotes.
But, they can injure you or even kill you so you gotta be careful.
Across the US, a lot of states are just open season on hogs all year round.
nut and berry flavors in it
You can even raise pigs in wild forest if you want to save money raising your own pigs. They dig out nuts and berries and mushrooms with their snouts, even truffles. It makes them leaner, but they run around more and get more muscle, makes for a rich meat with nice wild flavors. Some game meats are delicacies like boar, but there is not much demand for squirrel meat for example.
They dig out nuts and berries and mushrooms with their snouts
You can also find nuts and berries and mushrooms to live on in the forest, but don't use your snout. Or you can find a hog and cook it with mushrooms to eat with a side of nuts and berries, even while camping. Hunting for food while camping at the same time is a simple joy.
Why do we have so many invasive species
For some reason, the area I used to hunt boars in has none now. We think some kind of a disease wiped them out. 
You’re better off cooking hogs under 75lbs and honestly like 25lb piglets taste the best. Cook it low and slow like pulled pork. Big hogs taste gamey.
i am also in Scandiland (Denmark) just upgraded my fishing license a few weeks ago so i can set traps, looking forward to learning, i also wanna get into catching shore crabs, because we have billions of them and i can use most of my same traps, i dont even think there is any regulations on catching them and free food is free and crabs are delicious
Those hikers better be fags and niggers
Ah nice. Yeah crayfish are usually a lot of food for very minimal effort, just put out some cages and pull up ridiculous amounts (at least up here in Swedish lakes heh)
Hell yeah catch some crabs too, it’s a very nice activity! I’ve caught European green crab at the northern Sjælland coast a couple times and like you say, I doubt there are any rules about it… there are sooo many and they’ve taken over so many ecosystems worldwide lol

Why fren
Planning on moving to salt lake in June and staying for 2-3 months. Hoping to get a lot of climbing, hiking, and some camping in
Sort of. If you have a large enough group applying your chances of drawing one in a given year are pretty good. You can also call the ranger station and pick up ones that people cancel.
life kind of sucks. dead end job, shit town, barely save any money each month as it is and things keep going up in price with seemingly no ceiling. i just want to leave and never come back.
larping
and unfortunately working
Lots of weekend trips, working, planning another long trip. If I hit the lotto might fly to Reykjavik and walk across Iceland for 2 weeks in July or August
Heheh, good first post.
By hikers he means potentially anyone in this thread, so enjoy your outings won't you.
Fly out from California to Helsinki for hiking/mushroom hunting/moose watching/pike fishing
DAYTIME: Shorts, T-Shirt, Sunglasses prowling the watering holes for women. 
NIGHT: Leather Tunic, Flint Axe, killing assorted mystery meat immigrants. 
Example for instance: I don’t usually do anything on the weekend but that is the time to hunt. 15:00 go to local creek, act like one of them, city babes in sight. Sunglasses, sandals and shorts. Chit chat here and there, answer the average questions like; “What do you do for a living?” Or “Do you want to have kids?” Then I depart around 18:00. Night rolls around 19:45~ The fire should be roaring, I toss on Juniper leaves and Pine Needles, get it really smoky. Connect the Bluetooth speaker and play the drums. Do a quick dance, pray to the father for a good night, head out. I usually go barefoot and shouting as load as I can imitating the coyotes. 2KM run or so. Approach the weak and defenseless, strike at the neck, massive hemorrhage. Toss the bodies into the kern river. The rapids break them up unrecognizably. 
Another good hunt.
Git gud at long-distance backpacking.
Forage for edible plants.
Go backpacking with my Larping kit - maybe explore some abandoned mines on those trips.
Git gud at trapping small critters and hunting with my sling.
Heard from some other anon that boars can have a chemical in their meat that makes it taste and smell like literal shit.
So I think low-and-slow would definitely be the best, alongside tons of chilies and vegetables and spices to mask the flavor if you get a big boar.

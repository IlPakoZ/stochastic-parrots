I’m pretty new to all of this stuff, and I want to start going on solo camping trips in off-the-beaten-path areas so I don’t have to be at a campsite right next to a family of four with a huge camper or next to niggers blasting music. How would one get started? I’m looking at some one person tents and building a basic pack that I can grab and go whenever I get the urge.
Get a folding saw, a good full tang knife, solid boots, a wool blanket and sleeping bag. You can probably find a solid tent at your local outdoor store, but rule of thumb is if it says two person it fits one, three person fits 2. Don't bother with ultra lite for now. That's for people who can blow money or are weak.
When it comes to fire, practice somewhere first, and bring redundancy. Find a decent backpack, and throw it all in. A small compression bag is really good for clothes.
Don't listen to all of the retards here who've never stepped foot outside, all they're gonna do is get you to buy stupid shit like a 400 dollar ultralight down sleeping bag.
all of the good gear nowadays is practically ultralight anyways. simply by purchasing a decent kit you dont have to worry about weight.
anyways, the hardest part about getting started is finding a place to go. someplaces have really good backcountry areas and some are all private land and you will be confronted at gun point by an asshurt faggot rancher with a 3rd grade edumacation that misunderstands the castle doctrine
Based on this all I need is a pack and a tent, nice. Yeah finding land is gonna be difficult, I’m half tempted to camp out in some of the wooded areas in my city, although I would not be surprised to encounter a heroin addict or two
The ten essentials (in no particular order)
navigation
illumination
hydration
nutrition
first aid
fire
repair tools
insulation
shelter
sun and rain protection
That was a guideline The Mountaineers came up with a century ago. Just keep it in perspective. You don’t have to bring everything on every trip.
Shelter is a pretty broad category. Generally it’s a tent, a pad or j floatable mattress, and a sleeping bag. 
Sun, wind, and rain protection vary so much from place to place and season to season. I have like four (4) types of rain protection because it just varies that much. 
how do I find places?
Facebook and Reddit. Not joking.
What would you say makes good rain protection, like a tarp to lay over your tent?
a rainproof jacket and backpack that sheds water
How would one get started?
Laid-Back Camp would be a good place to start.
Well a tent normally has a rainfly. Tarping can be it's own thing. Literally browse a little YouTube and see you options and styles. I would say at minimum, a sleeping pad for ground insulation, a sleeping bag correctly rated for your temps, and rain protection (tarp, tent).
There are several things that need to be waterproof. 
Your shelter (tent) should be waterproof when you buy it. If you go really cheap, you can buy a product called Seem Seal (I think it’s just silicone, but I’m not certain) to brush onto the seams of your tent to waterproof it. They’re made of waterproof fabric, but the seams sometimes aren’t. Tarps are great as well, as they give a living space that isn’t totally enclosed like a tent. Again, the fabric is waterproof but the seams might not be. And I’m not talking about the blue hardware store tarps. 
The easiest way to protect the items in your backpack is to line the inside of it with a trash compactor garbage bag. A contractor bag works as well, but they’re usually much bigger. It’s a cheap, simple solution that nearly everyone with half a brain does. Your pack gets wet but the contents stay bone dry.
You’ll want a small, waterproof bag for your food. It’s always best to hang your food and toiletries from a tree, even if there aren’t bears in your area (rodents are a bigger problem). You don’t want your food rained on. 
As for keeping yourself dry, it really depends on temperature, wind, and the type of rain storm. A safe bet is a poncho, because they’re cheap, work well in milder showers, and are well ventilated for warmer temps. 
Or just go out when it’s not going to rain and figure it out later.

bar of soap
toothpaste
toothbrush and floss
toenail clippers w/ nail file
disposable razor
comb
bandana
I bring a wash rag, toothbrush/paste, deodorant, maybe dude wipes if I want to be fancy about it.
You guys dont /out/. Fucking DUDE WIPES. You get recommended those on reddit? Make sure to also pack your ultralight backcountry butt sinks to clean out your assholes for your boyfriends, fucking pretty boys
anyone who brings a thing I don't like doesn't go /out
Sorry, sir. I'll make sure to adjust my packing list to suit the desires of an armchair trail guide on an Albanian parasailing forum

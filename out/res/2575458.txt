Backpacking trailers are like $1000 commercially. Has anyone ever made their own? Do they live up to the hype for hauling game out of the woods?
these dont exist in the real world.
It honestly wouldn't cost shit to make one. I can make one with used shit for like 100$
this guy has them for $150 USD

But are they good? I'd be hiking 3 miles on a2-track, then 2-3 miles on extremely steep and rugged terrain. I'd probably have to leave the trailer on the road and drag a deer back to it. But at least it would make my last, tiredest 3 miles easier.
In the past 5 years. I have met my fair share of state/country walkers... They always opt to use a trailer with two wheels. The smartest one I've seen had a rail system with a slightly longer trailer- with cargo netting on top. So he could lay across the top without having to setup any ground system. Just used his standard bicycle tire/wheelchair tire setup.
I’ve never seen a hunter use one, but then again I’ve never seen a hunter who was very far from an ATV. Most people stick to what everyone else is doing.
I'll probably build one and report back in November, or sooner if I decide it's gay and don't bring it on my hunt.
Do you hold the bars over your shoulder like a yoke, or down near your waist like a wheelbarrow?
They hook onto a waist belt.
I'm not a refugee that needs to pack 200lbs 900 miles.
I'm sure they're fantastic for packing your cooler and grill to the beach without friends helping but why would you want to...
You can just carry or drag your game.
You can also snap the ankles and use the tendons to make a fleshcraft deer backpack for easy carrying.
This is the kinda stuff that really freaks out the city people lmao.
Metal as fuck.
Call it a travois
or a wheelbarrow lol
Why the fuck would you go way out innamountains just to be around other people?
Based NZ farmland. 
That's good fellow and red sized critters, Americans who shoot Elk have to carry the whole thing out and often a long way. I can see the value in one of those cart things.
My uncle did the white tail backpack thing. He came across a bear. The funeral was pretty sad, but the wake was a blast. I nailed his step daughter. Good times.
...mk
I've used one a few times while hog hunting with my bro, they work a lot better with trails than game carts due to the single wheel.
That's literally a wheelbarrow wheel and two broom handles. The ends for the axle looks like EMT someone flattened in a vice and painted white. $50 in materials and they are selling for $1500?? I'm starting a hiking trailer company...
Thats the only people I’ve seen use one
welp
cousin fucker rather

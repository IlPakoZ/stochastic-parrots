He entered the forest after an argue with his family. All he had was a plastic bag. I'm curious about what kind of technics did he used to last so long, but unfortunately there's no further information about the case so far. 
What's the longest time you've spend while /out/?
35 days is short enough that you can find a water source and just lay down until someone comes to rescue you.
The lord protected him
Proverbs 21:19
Amen.
honestly, if he was in alright health other than being moderately overweight at the start, and he found ok water, just sitting in place and avoiding moving too much in a warm to tepid environment wouldn't be that shocking to last 30-40 days,
Ive played Green Hell. The Amazon is easy mode as long as you dont get sick or injured.
You guys don't know the Amazon forest.
Yeah I've seen this show

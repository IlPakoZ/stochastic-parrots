I seriously hope you don't ever go /out/ with one of these. Even when your just commuting to work.
Without* Also when SHTF/nuclear war
Even when your just commuting to work.
Is commuting to work that dangerous in Clapistan?
I have the garmin watch with topographic maps
eat shit poorfags
Yes it is, either on the road from.some sleep deprived/hungover driver who sheckleburg boss had work 80 to 100 +hours a week crashing into you. To the crackheads at the bus stop/metro station that will threaten you with used needles for cash.
Oh yes forgot to mention without the garmin watch you cant remote control the inreach PLB. Which is more of an issue if you keep in the case.
America is so fucked up you can't even go on the street from your own home to get to work without dealing with incorrigible human trash that liberals actively enable.
Don't you have to pay for the inreach to work as a PLB? Or is it just the satcom you have to pay monthly for?
There was some famous missing hiker case where he has a spot PLB but he didn't have the subscription so he died lol
Yes you need subscription for the Garmin to work.
Yea the subscription is the biggest bullshit. Even if the emergency button works, you can get something for half the price tied to govt search and rescue.
Satellite messaging to occasionally tell someone you're running late or need them to drive over and pick you up shouldn't cost 500 bucks + a forced monthly fee.
It's a shame Garmin practically has a monopoly on the market or we might get that service at reasonable rates
Just use pic. Inb4 retards who don’t know how cell phones have worked for the past 15 years despite having several of them.
The subscription for the garmin inreach is at the lowest tier 11bux a month w/contract and 15bux without. Something Iike 10 free messages, weather and unlimited sos.
I would not blame garmin but iridium that owns the satellites
Using a cell phone in an remote environment with limited to no signal.
poor battery life with adware consuming apps.
no dedicated GPS
Is this what retards actually belive?
L
Cell phones do have dedicated GPS and have for about a decade now. Also, I'm pretty sure that iFaggot wasn't even talking about that and was referring to the fact that the newest iPhones now have built a in Satellite SOS feature that indeed uses satellites to contact EMS with your location and you can even text them
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213426
I want to die though
It’s so strange to me that people are still unaware of how the GPS function of a cell phone works. It’s just baffling as hell. 
Battery life? Sure, you can only squeeze four days out of one by putting it in power saving mode, turning down the brightness, closing background apps, using airplane mode, not checking your location every two minutes, and so on. And you’ll need the separate power supply that you probably already own if you want to extend it longer than any trip you’ve probably been in without access to power anyway.
Durability? Yeah, you have to be careful not to smash it with a rock like a Cro-Magnon and you have to know where to buy Ziploc freezer bags. Nearly everyone hikes with a phone anyway, and since everyone mentions this there must be a lot of Grug rock smashing, a severe shortage of Ziploc bags, and a lot of broken and water damaged phones.
But muh cell service? Nah.
Yes unironically
he hasn't found the settings
he lets his phone do what it wants
ngmi
This discussion again? 
Yes, you *can* use your phone for navigation if you're a complete pleb who needs his fucking trendy gizmos to move around the outdoors without risking getting lost if he lost his precious trail markers/blazes.
and these people call themselves "outdoorsmen"
Holy shit, /out/ is making progress and people are catching up to where everyone else was a decade ago and realizing what a GPS signal is! Next we’ll all learn about this new material they’re calling “silpoly.”
wearing plastic
ISHYGDDT
I guess we still have some work to do before you retards move away from waxed canvas clothing and lean-tos made from sticks.
says the retard who wears plastic and doesn't know how to navigate with a compass
NO YOU CAN'T USE YOUR PHONE AS GPS!! ITS NOT DESIGNED TO BE USED AS ONE! THE BATTERY WILL DIE IN 3 HOURS! RABID WILD MEN WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND RAPE YOU!
implying you ever let your phone do what you want
the typical "outdoorsman" of the 2010s and 2020s, ladies and gentlemen
Wait, am I allowed to say "ladies and gentlemen" in 2023 or will the tranny jannies get offended and ban me again?
 if the emergency button works, you can get something for half the price tied to govt search and rescue.
Like what? Just remember even in the city you are always just one set away from ending up like picture related.
A PLB will not save your from being homeless
Top kek
Wearing a natural fiber like cotton that is drenched in all manner of pesticides and fertilizer wool which is cleaned of litter animal shit
Vs
Synthetic fiber that is a byproduct of the petroleum industry and is extruded in a controlled environment.
muh plastic
What’s your tent made out of?
The skin of murdered hikers who didn't bring proper gear and a PLB.
My tent isn't rubbing all over my skin 24/7, though if there were a non-plastic alternative I'd take it.
wool which is cleaned of litter animal shit
oh no it touched da sheep poo poo, ICKY!!!!!
he didn't get the point
What is the point then? Synthetics make you infertile. Though you're probably the sort of person who thinks that's a good thing.
Synthetics make you infertile
Lol wut?
Pesticide drenched cotton or flax does not.
Lol wut?
google polyester + infertility
Pesticide drenched cotton or flax does not.
No, it doesn't as far as I know. Pesticides wash off pretty easily and there is such a thing as organic cotton. Besides, my base layers are wool.
It's Elon Musk who's charging Iridium an arm and a leg to launch their satellite upgrades.
You’re the first Luddite contrarian fag to actually admit that a phone will work as a GPS device without a cell signal. You should try it next time you’re out. The. You can come back and be contrarian again by saying it was only accurate to 3m which isn’t nearly as good as your Garmin, while simultaneously saying people shouldn’t need gadgets or gizmos (that you already own, and already have in your pocket).
Nah, I'll stick to my map and compass like I have for three decades
an arm and a leg
SpaceX is by far the cheapest option out there
Based azimuth enjoyer
Sure you will Anon. No, we totally believe you.
He won't respond to this.
Oh no, some tech-reliant, spacially-retarded zoomers and millennials won't believe that I don't need to rely on technology to constantly spoonfeed me my position. What will I ever do?
He did, but it’s just as retarded as we expected.
says the person who cannot even navigate without a phone guiding him
The irony
The PLB isn't just a GPS it's a satellite communications Locator Beacon should shtf.
On this note, does anyone know of good phone apps for making trail maps? I'm making a trail map by hand but it'd be neat to have GPS data to use too
what a polite insult
The Garmin Explore app is pretty gud. You can import/export gpx files, create courses and way points. You can also take a tracked activity from your garmin device (i.e a hike) and turn it into a course.
I refuse to believe that anyone could navigate without my electronic binky
Sad, really
I want to know this too.
money.
These aren't the junkies of your fathers times, the shit that's on the streets these days is nothing like back then, their brains are literally fried.
Ment to reply to you, they will threaten to stab you will used needles if you don't give them money.
it's called bantz and not gonna lie the name Clapistan made me laugh
These threads are so fucking exhausting. Its always poor fags trying to justify the fact they can't afford one of the best oh shit buttons ever made. Go watch thru hiker death stories and realize what a valuable thing a garmin inreach is.

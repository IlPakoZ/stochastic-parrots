What do you guys wear when out?
What methods do you use to stop your slop from leaking down your leg?
just don't wear underwear
Hockey
anything tight that protects your balls from ticks
cotton wraps. two pairs. wash one each day.
Compression shorts.
I wear these.
Cosy fit for my thighs, arse and bollocks. Natural material that's comfortable and thick enough to go for a wild swim in. 
The bright white means I can closely monitor the stains at the end of each hike. Check if I've blown my ringhole out or got some sort of discharge.
The benefits are obvious.
Icebreaker anatomica long. Merino, long cut and still affordable. Doesn't smell to bad even after 3 days, no swamp ass and no chaffing (loosing 15 pound might have helped too with that one)
50 bucks a pair
bruh
I wear nothing but Ex Officio and I've been happy with them for a long time but I'm thinking of doing the merino wool meme
Daily reminder that polyester underwear reduces your sperm count by 30%.
picrel
If I lost another 60% on top of that we'll be shooting the same numbers
Under where?
Under deez nuts
Nah, dont pay retail. If you look around you should get them for 30, bought mine in some clearance sale for 22.
but it only lasts for about 40 days of hiking before the crack wears through.
Hard to do when the kikes mutilated your penis at birth
has to be 100% merino wool for longer trips. current favorites are smartwool.
for under 3 full days any synthetic is fine, they just start to stink bad on day 2+
I usually wear women's panties. They support nicely and they are sexy
explain? i'm cut and have been free balling for 30+ years. started in HS and only wear underpants if i think i'll need them or it's winter

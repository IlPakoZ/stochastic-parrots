WTF is it with everything having ts own bag?
Bought a new sleep pad. It came with a strap that holds it when rolled up, but it also came in a bag. Bought a metal spoon, it came with its own bag. Also a coo pot and guess what? Bag.
Outdoor store near me has dozens of different bags and I have seen people buy them. 
WTF does everything have its own bag? I just stuff my shit in my pack why would I keep each thing in a bag?
Organization an aesthetics. I personally don't care for them, and have switched over to using guy lines with a slip knot for everything that needs to be rolled up. Everything else that is loose goes into a single dyneema bag. Depending on the situation, I may have a separate dyneema bag for food if I need to hang it.
Stuff sacks are fucking amazing
They help you organize; compress; keep things dry and make things easier to access in your pack--they also weigh next to nothing. I keep my headlamp in a bag to keep it from getting scratched. I keep my cook set in a bag because I keep a bunch of stuff in my cook set. I keep my toothbrush in a bag with floss and a toothbrush.
I keep my sleeping bag in a ski to sea compression sack... although I do agree they need to stop selling sleeping bags with compression sacks--ski to sea has a better sleeping bag compression system than 90% of the OEMs.
my bad
Sea to Summit is the bag
Ski to Sea is the race that inspired the name
haha this. i got a fancy inflatable kayak and it came in its own waterproof dry pack. why would i need to keep the kayak 100% dry while its being stored, the material is inherently waterproof already. so i just have this massive useless backpack that is way to big to use for any camping trip beyond a full everest siege expedition in 1945
God I love it when Americans post. It's just so entertaining.
OP, the bags protect your gear so you can use it for longer. 
Constant rubbing and abrasion will ruin gear if used long enough. 
Fortunately, most of /out/ doesn't even use their gear often enough to worry about that.
Pots make sense. If you’re cooking over an open fire it’s going to get pretty funky, and funk up your other stuff. Compression sacks for sleeping bags are useful if your bag is synthetic, as they can compress things more than your pack. Obviously you need a food bag, and one for a first aid kit (either of those can also hold toiletries). 
And if you don’t need to hang your food (because rodents and insects don’t exist) then you just toss individual food items into your pack?
Lumpy over here doesn’t have compression straps in his pack
They’re named after an ascent of Mt. Everest that started as a hike from sea level rather than Everest Base Camp. 
item rubs against your backpack and it will fall apart
item rubs against a compression sack and it’s ok
Inb4 it’s compressed. It’s compressed by your backpack.
item rubs against your backpack and it will fall apart

rub hand against sand paper and scratch up your hand
rub gloved hand against sand paper and the glove gets scratched up
i hope you have a ground sheet under your tent at least
I haven’t seen an analogy this bad since that time I dropped out of analogy school. 
pack is made of nylon
stuff sacks are made of nylon
contents are made of nylon
gloves aren’t made of sandpaper
hands aren’t made of sandpaper
I use a tarp. Should I use a footprint under my footprint?
you could make a glove out of sandpaper and it would be just as valid (assuming grit-side is the outside of the glove)
but worse still even a glove made of living human skin rubbing against living human skin would still shield the gloved living human skin so it really doesn't matter that all your stuff is made of nylon 
I use a tarp. Should I use a footprint under my footprint?
i'm not sure what a footprint under your footprint even means in practical terms, but a boot would protect your socked feet better than nothing at all
You really are a retard. Damn.
Just use a durable tent and you won't need any footprints. I have never used a footprint in my entire live.
Holy shit you're absolutely retarded. You have the reading comprehension of a child.
Please stop posting about what you obviously don't know anything about.
Imagine spending time packing everything into its own meme sack when you can just stuff everything into one compacter bag. Takes up less space and is lighter. Only retards and women use those
noooo you can't just compartmentalize your pack
compression straps
keep stuff dry
neck yourself, retard
doesn’t know what a pack liner is
I mean people have been using them for at least 20 years but whatever.
I use a tarp and occasionally just a ground sheet I made from waterproof 1.9oz nylon when there are no bugs. Have you ever heard of someone using a similar setup and another ground sheet under that? It’s ridiculous, right?
Thanks for contributing.
I know this is going to come as a shock to you, but not everyone uses this gear just to put in backpack. You can use this gear in kayaks, cars, truck beds, pack animals, boats, and more. Having a basic form fitting cover offering basic protection is pretty helpful.
I know you were given contribution awards for participation but my obvious contribution is pointing out how obviously retarded your "contribution" is.
He has the reading comprehension of a child. His life must be quite difficult.
On longer hikes I bring a small food bag in addition to my normal food bag. Whatever I’m having for lunch and snacks go into the smaller bag in the morning. That way when I stop to eat I’m not digging through a giant bag of food.
Use your words.
Beep boop beep beep boop

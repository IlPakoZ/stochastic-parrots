Bam Margera high on meth and half naked is currently evading the police in the woods of Pennsylvania. He has been awake for several days straight. How long do we estimate he will last? Some are speculating based on his brothers comments that he may have caches of supplies stored and possibly meth and alcohol. How does having access to meth change his survival chances?
Has he now become a cryptid like bigfoot or moth man?

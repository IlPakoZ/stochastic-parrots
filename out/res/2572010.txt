THINGS YOU'D SAY TO YOUR BEGINNER SELF
what would you say to yourself at the very moment you started going /out/?
literally anything, say it, no matter how small, as long as its something you realized being /out/side
as embarrassing as it is, i've literally only been going /out/ into the forest since a week from now, other than that, its just been a wasteland of a desert for me, so i never left the house
in my week of being /out/side so far (i moved to a green place), i'd say is stop being so rampantly paranoid of people attempting to murder you, aside from them not being insane, they don't really seem to go wherever you go, let alone walking via river itself, so its all very safe 
so, anons, what would you say to yourself?
we live in a society
Get a digital camera, a bird identification guide, and a notebook immediately, don't wait. There's a lot of depth and enjoyment that you're missing just because you haven't got around to it yet. Earlier is better.
being /out/ is not anything to be glorified it is just something you should learn to do and if you did not get any fish you should learn to appreciate you just beign there you little impatient me
Just get out there. There's no right or wrong way until you've experienced it. Cowboy camp as often as you can.
"Look at that fat little faggot! Look, he barely can breathe anymore! Haha. Run fatty run! You sweaty little nigger!"
If you need this explained to you, then to be honest you're ngmi.
i spent my childhood in the forest with my dad fishing and hunting and i never appreciated until i grew up
Drive out of state, explore new places, and don't be afraid to screw up. You'll be OK and you'll learn way more from failing two states away than you will sweating over your next work project... Plus you'll have more pictures and more things to write about.
Idk why anyone has ever felt like that. Then again I started out going in the woods with another person so I wasn't alone for a long time. Eventually I felt comfortable going alone. I've never seen a single person where they aren't supposed to be.
"none of my friends do it" is a shit excuse
start doing it and make friends that do
have you been to cities lately?
"I need friends to /out/" is another shitty excuse. I don't wait for someone else to be ready, I don't have to accommodate their needs, and I don't need to rush home to get them to back to their cage on time. Having a friend along is fun, but there are serious advantages to going solo.
If people tell me they want to go /out/, I tell them when I'm okay with having them along. If they show up, cool. If they don't, cool. Don't make your plans contingent on anyone else and you'll have a good time.
Never bring a woman /out/, or travel with friends who insist on bringing their handler boss-mommies with them.
You are not an Army Ranger. You are not Joel from the Last of Us. You are not Strelok. It does not matter how many kilometers you went. It does not matter how much suffering you pushed through. It does not matter which 1000D nylon cock carrying appliances you have.
Going /out/ is about letting go, not giving yourself license to hold on even tighter. Go be alone, live in a quiet place for the hours that you can, and pay attention to your surroundings and yourself instead of pretending to pay attention and imagining terrorists storming your one man LARP camp.
Also, maybe buy some bitcoin.
Don't wait to hike till you have the exact perfect best gear on the internet. Buy something cheap and close enough and use it till you find out what you don't like about it then replace it. 
Just go for things, try something you don't think you'll like. Don't turn down offers for new experiences
Glad you didn't buy any gransfors bruks products, seeing how they're Agenda 2030 sell outs. Fucking WEF cucks.
go out more. stop worrying about perception of your gear or appearance and do it
don't wear steel toe leather boots if you haven't taken them on a long walk before. for your next boots, don't allow the flamboyant homosexual from REI to pressure you into buying shitty boots that don't fit properly.
check your equipment before you leave. specifically check that your trangia burner actually boils water and doesn't have crusted-over holes (even if dad said it worked last time) and that your tent has zero holes and the right number of poles (even if your friend said it was all good).
trail mix should have reasonable macros and fibre, your meal plan shouldn't substitute trail mix for lunch, and if you eat nothing but peanuts and chocolate for twelve hours on a difficult walk you will become tubgirl.
The bear doesn't need or want a hug.
Actually do kill yourself, it doesn't actually get better, you just drag more people into your bullshit.
I mean uhhh don't be so afraid to fail and improve, or something.
the woods hunger, anon
Cut it out with the milsurp LARP
you're a dirty vagrant, not a clean and welcomed guest
stop worrying about perception and don't try to be accepted
I wouldn't say anything to my beginner self other than words of encouragement. Now my pre-/out/ self that weighed 250 lbs and wasted his life doing fuck all with his free time? I would tell him to get the fuck outside and touch grass.
Not really no, there's nothing there for me.
I grew up camping and hunting, I live out innawoods, and I would say that some very specific skills can make a huge difference when you are camping and surviving.
Hunting, fishing, trapping fish and game, building shelter from natural materials, finding food and water in the wilderness, tracking animals, being able to identify wildlife, starting a fire with just sticks.
You have shelter, food, water, and warmth which can be used food cooking your food, all sourced naturally with only your hands if you have to.
can also be used to boil and distill water, and you get charcoal as a byproduct
This is an unnecessary skill
Significantly more valuable than knowing sportsball stats or being good at video games
Completely unrelated.
Stop worrying about what your overprotective family/society says, nut up, and go explore.
Giving blowjobs is an unnecessary skill, but I bet it made your mom a lot more fun
Larping is an unnecessary skill and you should promptly kill yourself because you never go outside yet you're on this board.
since this is a begginer thread does anyone have advice for someone doing their first wild camp or a beginner camper, and if you're from there anything specific to the uk
Donâ€™t go hiking with your dad. His lack of enthusiasm and preparation for a trip he suggested will make you regret wasting a week.
This, for cave drawings.
Don't buy heavy milsurp junk, save up for stuff that will make you actually enjoy your hike. Wear shoes that have a wide toe box instead of shoes that are a size too big. Join a mountaineering club. Dump the girl. She's too lazy, she'll hold you back and you'll grow to resent her. Don't do stupid stunts while drunk, you'll fuck up your knee/ankle.
I would tell myself to stop going to /fa/ and save all that money spent on useless gay clothes and fill my closet with arcteryx gear instead. I love stunting on poor hikers with my sick arcteryx fits on trails.
Just do it, don't overthink, just go outside and enjoy nature, you will learn as you do, and get a notebook for journaling + identification book for plants/birds etc. 
Used to fish/hunt as a kid with my dad and didn't like it. Only after 30 did I get interested again and wanted that relaxation and connection and feeding yourself with your own hands, thats why I started appreciating gardening/farming too. Too bad most everything my dad taught me went out one ear as a kid.
No one is impressed by your chink pfas gear
I've met girls on trail that have offered to walk with me. Probably thought I was so pro athlete or something since I'm always draped in arcteryx
Buy MORE milsurp, it's only going to dry up and/or get more expensive.

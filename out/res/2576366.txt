Thoughts on this brand
Trendy, gay, dogshit.
Thoughts on Helikon-Tex?
Trendy
its is trendy. Its also trendy to hate on it.
gay
its an inanimate object and thus doesnt do sex...calling it "gay" is a sign of insecurity tho
dogshit
the stuff I've used has been decent. Cooler was bombproof and kept shit cold for a long time. My coffee mugs keeps it warm for 7hrs. Not dog shit
the brand of white people with poorly behaved children and lifted RAM trucks. As an aside, someone gifted me the OP mug and it's a great mug; keeps my coffee hot all day if I keep it closed. Not worth the price though I think.
Wow, my generic chinkshit vacuum cup also keeps stuff hot for hours, who knew. 
I have another brand of icechest that's made in the USA, has better latches, lifetime warranty, and can be easily locked to the bed of my truck. 
Yeti is gayer than (you)
I have money, but no soul
Good
Stfu you fucking cunt and get fuck out of here with your gay fucking brand and watch threads, like who the fuck needs to buy a specific watch? Any fucking watch will do you dumb retard. And if you really care about a dumb watch that much then just become an hero
Acceptable if you get it for free (a bunch of companies gives them out as swag, got a 10oz one from a few months ago for attending a sales call). Keeps drinks warm, though it's not fully watertight. Would not pay money for it.
very good
work well, albeit overpriced. i'm sure you could find something that works just as well from some chinkshit brand on amazon for half the price.
rule of thumb: if a non-clothing company sells t-shirts or other apparel with their logo on it, their gear is always overpriced.

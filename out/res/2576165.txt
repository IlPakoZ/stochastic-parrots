so basically uh, I'm tapping out.
tmw your nickname at every family bbq from now on is "bear shit"
watching staged faggotry instead of just going outside
for what purpose?
I remember that dude, day one, walks into the woods and taps out 2 maybe 3 hours later
Some of us actually have jobs we pretend to work at
I don't recall him even walking into the woods, I remember him losing his shit right at the drop off point.
One of the funniest moments on the show next to the dumb cunt preaching girl power who puts an axe right into her hand
Talk all the bad shit you want about her, but I still want her to sit on my face.
What season?
S02E01
Kino, me and wife love this show. Our church would have pretty stromb convictions against TV but we pull ye old hidden roku out for this one now and again.
This was kino
Season 9 was just retards shooting animals tgat get away to die suffering and the retard spic killing the friendly curious weasel for absolutely no reason.
Worst season ever. Abundant animals everywhere and retards killing them in unethical and completely inhumane ways then giggling about it to the camera and saying THANK YOU NATUREEE
Absolutely disgusting.
Only redeeming quality was the lack of censor beeps.

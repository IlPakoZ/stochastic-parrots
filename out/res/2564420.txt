What's stopping you from going outside?
This is the thread we use to talk about our problems and personal issues stopping from spending more time /out/.
Be honest and open anons. This is a safe space. No normies allowed.
its muddy as fuck outside right now, the winter snow was almost fully melted and then it snowed another 20cm this week. maybe by the end of the month
I bet next month you will complain about mosquitos.
Eternal winter and interlodge orders atm.
When I had a job I didn't have enough time to go/out/
Now I don't have enough money. Retarded poorfag who can't drive so any decent out trip means spending like 50 on public transportation and I can't even pay my bills
Bit of laziness, and most of my “free time” is spent improving the property(garden, other projects)
But mostly laziness and taking things for granted. It’s quite sad.
fuckin soaked an muddy here, rained all day yesterday and pretty much rained all last week, ran some errands today and it is fairly cool so that's been nice
to be honest because most places are owned by retards that make the forests private property
I only work 21 hours a week so I have lots of free time most of which I spend gathering and splitting firewood to sell for some extra cheese. 
There is nothing stopping me from going to new places during the day because my job starts in the evening, the weather is getting better and I have a few spots on my list to visit. 
I'm a cunt so I don't travel much during the winter time. 
I really cant imagine working over 40+ hours a week for someone else without a real sense of purpose, but I admire people who manage to do that. 
Pic related is my Easter fire, it has been going strong for 8 days lmao. 
Same here, snow > rain > mud and shit > repeat. 
It really is no surprise though, I think we just simply forget that seasons come and go kek.
Even in Brazil this shit happens, everything gets dirty af it's awfull 
humidity levels in the forest are very high
Alright, then come to Sweden my fren. We move freely here as long as we don't walk directly into someones yard.
If people were more respectful I’d be okay letting people hike or camp on my land.
But I live in Oregon so they’d a)never leave b) invite their hobo junkie friends c) shut the place up (literally) and leave all manner of trash lying around.
I feel your pain though, growing up dad and I’d try to find places to camp/set up the telescope, and it was no trespassing sign after no trespassing sign.
I will say though, if it’s Weyerhaeuser land, or some other absentee landowner (think corps or conservation trusts out of CA) it’s your civic duty to trespass
Wish Canada had this shit
90% of the province is crown land with pretty free usage, which is great, but you still come across gated backcountry roads(even publicly funded ones) and private land blocking access to public land all the time, and it's getting gradually worse.
Canada is pretty shit for /out/ in general.
Coworkers are neurotic normies and don't understand that plans don't come to a screeching halt when they don't understand something
I feel you brah, it gets me mad that niggers can fuck with the forest with their trash 
but you're right, I want to try it out tomorrow ngl, I'll trespass no matter what, fuck those retarded rules, I don't even know if there are any laws about it in Brazil
Relative to most of the world it's still pretty good, legal wild camping on crown land puts it well ahead of a lot of developed countries, and 90% is not an exaggeration, BC land is apparently 94% public, even if most of that is 10 hours drive from anywhere. The physical country itself is easily in the top 3 of the planet, largely because it's huge and has world class examples of nearly every biome, but outdoor shit is commercializing more and more and the government is complicit in giving private companies leases on key areas that gate access to wild backcountry, logging companies are less and less likely to allow easy public access to forest service roads which is a bit of a legal grey area, and all these problems are a lot worse the closer to a town you get, which is somewhat understandable because normalfags cause problems but degrading access to nature is a real issue.
I'm afraid that a normonkeygroidie will use their mobile device to take a picture of me in my post apocalyptic larp outfit and post me online to laugh at me
Same.
Also, I feel depressed going /out/ when jobless. I just feel directionless and like a complete bum.
I'm lazy honestly. it's easier to just sit on the couch with my laptop. I'm getting outside more though, through personal guilt
fuck you for making me want to take a trip to the thrift store now
one more day until the lakes thaw and i can go fishing
I have schizophrenia
I just came back home. 
My feet hurt. 
Look at this newt I found. 
Also why would I want to be anything like those trashy individuals?
i'm a retarded poorfag who never learned how to drive. and it feels like even if i did learn and get a license there's no way i could afford car insurance on top of my other current expenses, which means even if i got a license i legally wouldn't be able to drive, and if i can't drive i can't get to any good wilderness areas. there's a hiking trail near by i can ride my bike to but that's about it and there's no camping allowed there so if the weather is good i can hike for a few hours before going home and that's it.
i went /out/ on easter and got assaulted by no less than 30 ticks despite spraying my clothes in permethrin beforehand, when i got home monday i used my dogs flea and tick killing shampoo because i was so paranoid i missed 10 more
it didn't help that i was using a polish lavvu, i really need to invest in a tipi style tent that has an inner mesh portion to keep insects out because i woke up covered in ants
Unironically? I live in Japan now, and I have no idea what the rules and regulations are. The last thing I want is to be going to some campsite and breaking some implicitly known thousand year old law because the culture is different and suddenly a dozen nip gendarmes haul me in for crimes against the forest spirits.
the woods out here are too small and teenagers will come harass me if i loiter too long without molesting a child or buying drugs
i love camping but the outdoors are TOO accessible
wish there was some proper wilderness to disappear into for a week or two without having to make an international trip
I see shit in the corner of my eyes all the time and I've gradually become terrified to even leave my room through the years. I used to go /out/ but it's impossible now, I'm constantly terrified near to a panic attack, recently it's become hard to even be in the hallway or the kitchen at night.
Have you seen a psychiatrist? Your brain chemistry is probably fucked
moved to suburbia with a needy wife, 2 kids, and demanding job makes me just want to lay on the couch on my free time
I no longer have any gear as well and broke most of the time. on top of that there's just fucking people everywhere now, even my favorite trails are now crowded with families of 30 pajeets being annoying as hell or the entire forest was bulldozed for new suburbs
I live north of Toronto and 20 years ago it used to be amazing. just pack up with my friends and go camp on some island a buddy's friend knows about. end up partying with random people who also show up to camp.
now every inch of lakefront property has been sold to rich fucks and developed to hell and back. you need to travel an entire day by car to avoid it
Thanks for posting anon. As soon as 5:00 comes around I’m putting on my boots and getting the dog out for a hike.
It’s kind of a shame to live out here and not spend more time outside
I am physically unable to catch a single fish as of late and it's got me down in the dumps. Where the fuck are they all?
I live in the Amazon region. Everything wants to kill you once you step out. I want to go out, but I'm not prepared and it would take a long time to learn from the right people. My intention is to first get a kayak, and find a spot where I can camp and fish for a few days.
Overfearing wild animals.
I live in eastern Europe, we have brown bears and wolves. I always have a bear spray with me but still chicken out. One bad encounter and ded :|
Gotta love big city life eh
You don't need to larp to be outside. The people that take the larp too seriously and don't have any self awareness for how out of touch they are, they are cringe. You're not that silly, are you? Even if you are, if you really believe the larp crap then why care? Do you care about your appearance or not? If you really care about your appearance you can larp and not look like a retard taking it too far.
Make friends. Even ones that aren't ideal. Join a local hiking group. Check your areas Facebook pages for clubs. There's people like you, looking for people to hang with. You just have to put in the effort to try and find them.
See this? This is larping too hard. Your gun is as embarrassing as hentai hoodies. It screams "this guy doesn't have shit figured out".
How embarrassing. Do it again. Then do it again, and again, and again. Soon, you'll figure out what works and what doesn't. For now, you gotta get your shit together anon, lol.
worsening health issues, i have Osteopetrosis, so ive had 4 hip breaks, 2 each side, ankle, lower right leg, shoulder, dont even cout ribs, fingers or toes cause the hospital cant do shit about that
hospital also realized i have Hemochromatosis 
too apparently, so im going in for literal blood letting a week where they steal like, half a liter of bloodd, gotta feed the hospitals sewer vampires i guess.
my skeletons garbage, and now my bloods being dumb too apparently... and i dont remember what the doctor said, but, something about your blood being kinda important, fuck how should i know?
been stocking up on cool wood so i can at least carve some spoons or something, and the local fishing spot isnt too far away
I really cant imagine working over 40+ hours a week for someone else without a real sense of purpose, but I admire people who manage to do that
Man I've been working around 60 hours a week for the past 2 years but I get a real sense of purpose from it and sleep well. The owners of the dairy and beef farm I work on are getting old and their adult children want nothing to do with it, so I've helped them through their ravages of old age by keeping shit going when one of them is off work for months getting a knee replacement and the other is off getting a hip replacement. They love their cows and I've learned to love the cows as much as the cows love me back as the designated Feeder Of Silage and Treatmaster
Same here, snow > rain > mud and shit > repeat.
These. Being outside isn't hard (but it is hard?) if you choose to work in rural jobs or happen to be born into the location and lifestyle. I made the deliberate choice to move out here and work 12 hour days fisting cows and driving plows in circles because the scenery and freedom is a novelty to me, but people that grow up in this environment want nothing to do with it
everything gets dirty af it's awfull

As someone who is forced to be /out/ from the moment I leave my house, it's terrifying living alone remotely. There's snakes that are longer than you are tall casually slithering around, and spiders the size of your hand casually booping around your doors and windows, and bunyips or yetis or skinwalkers or some shit that screech in the middle of the night. Whenever I stay in the city or with friends in suburbia I sleep like a log. There's no Spooky Hoot, there's no multi-legged skittering across your face, and there's no unexplained lights in the night sky. From one grown anon to another, there's no shame in feeling fear
I'm a student with strict parents, can't leave the house for more than a couple hours, even that after getting permission to go out, plus I live in suburbia, so no place nearby to enjoy the wonders of nature. How do I get /out/ bros?
honestly? i just get cold too easily :(
waiting for summer...
It's more comfy in the AC in a bed with my favorite tv shows in the background or read. Why in the fuck would I take a step outdoors?
The constant wind. I live in the windiest damn place in America. Every camping trip is a losing battle, every day fishing is whitecaps on the lakes, every hike is the wind tearing at your clothes and dust and sand blowing into your eye sockets. I now understand why people live in houses.
Raising a puppy before it can go outdoors without kekking itself
Based newt appreciator
Here's one I saw last week

It's been almost two months anons and I can barley walk. I went to the doctor, stretch daily and took Valium but nothing has helped. What do?
You need magnesium bud
Go to another doctor or just stop being a bitch.
Go back to your doctor and ask them to refer you to a specialist. You might even just be able to call and have them refer you. General practitioners aren’t the best at diagnosing or treating this kind of injury, which is why his diagnosis was that you hurt you leg and should just stay off of it. A specialist (physiatrist, but most like an orthopedic doctor, or just a doctor in sports medicine) can really figure out what’s going on and the best course of action.
check really really closely for ticks.
What kind of pain are you experiencing? Sounds like it's time to talk to a physical therapist. I made it to 30 before my body started falling apart due to a stupid genetic problem reared its head. It was difficult to accept since I had pushed through physical pain my entire life. I'm still always in pain, but it's managed now with physical therapy. 
Physical therapists are trained to know why you are feeling the way you do. They have deep knowledge of biomechanics. Ask your gp to recommend you to one. Better yet if it's affiliated with a good college so that the people are trained in the most recent shit. Changed my life. Worst was learning that I'm physically incapable of doing what other people my age can do and I'll always be in pain. Still get out and camp, but I have to hike slow to avoid injury.

would it be a bad idea to camp just slightly off the trail in my woodlot? for an overnight camp, what would i need? im northeast US if that helps
overnight camp
you could literally just sleep by a tree on the ground if you were so inclined
literally just bring whatever you want
is it really that simple
humanity, the homeless, kids who ran away from home, /out/ anons, and everything in between have been doing this since time immemorial 
so yes, spending a single night outside, as opposed to inside, probably won't make mustardgas; you will however, probably be covered in ticks when you wake up though
so just buy like a sleeping or a tent or some shit
For a single night? Cheap tent, cheap sleeping bag, something to eat and some whiskey.
If its your land, you can do what you want. Watch some videos about camping with a tarp, and go pitch a plowpoint. Watch for ticks! That's about it.

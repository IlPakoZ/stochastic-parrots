Your favourite/out/ cup?
Mine is the large foldacup in orange
Black enamelware mug I bought for a quid ages ago. It just works.
Enamel, like real porcelain enamel? Had an old coffee pot with that, and it started to cracked due to roughing around in my backpack
Enamelware - coated metal.
hey fellow /out/doorsmen! I need to know which is the highest quality cup brand. I currently own the CumMug 2.0 2011 Edition but it adds 0.001 ounces more than I am comfortable with so I am willing to splurge on something nice.
btw I'm trans if that matters
I like Stanley with removable cup
let me guess, you need more?
This thing has been great. 
Takes up no room, is light and easy to handle without burning your hands.
We cant discuss gear... because... because we just hecking can´t OK??!?
for me, it's my insulated Yeti mug. it was a gift. I fell in love with it the first time I brought it /out/, it was like 3ºC and pouring rain up in the Brindabellas and I just sat under my tarp and kept the tea pouring and it was glorious
i like the small foldacup in purple
Nice digits, but it's hard to pour coffee with that configuration
I found an old thick copper cup while metal detecting. It's covered in runes and if you drink out of it you never die.
A friend of mine in the scouts would always buy the purple ones, then soak them in bleach, so they turn a really awful lavender-ish color, so people wouldnt steal his cup
Plus they also make a good autism toy
nigga just go buy a cup from the store
based
the what store?
the cup store
i like ones with lids so i can put delicate things in them to protect while theyre in my pack
Quechua steel mug from Decathlon
milsurp classic. cook and drink, cost me $2. ran it over with a car, no problem. unkillable.
cook
you should limit how much you expose aluminium to heat for food or drink, a lot of studies point to it having negative health effects later in life such as alzheimers, no consensus on exposure ammount though, but best avoided if possible
The aluminium causing alzheimers has been deboonked afaik.
which one would youse guys pick? post sceengrab pls

inb4 the edgy answer
sounds like something from 'the far side'
Shot a nice Fallow in the Brindabellas last year. Great place to camp
12cm Imusa mug. They’re $9 on Amazon. Sometimes Walmart has them. It holds 40oz, while the smaller 10cm is like 30oz (not really sure). BatchStovez makes lids for these mugs for about the same price as the mug itself. There are lots of DIY solutions to insulating the handle, usually wrapping it in some kind of fiberglass lamp wick or silicone of some kind.
the Brindies are where I want my ashes scattered †bh
and good work on your hunt, you should shoot many more if you can, if your chest freezer can hold them all
Based Larson enjoyer
kuksa
cute but overrated
i havnt kept up with the research for a couple years, my trangia is alu i think, but coated, i ussually use steel or titanium, although titanium is garbage for heat distribution
coated
What’s it coated with?
idunno, some non-slip stuff
feed me the chemicals unregulated capitalism-Daddy yumm yumm slurrp slurrp
(some kind of teflon)
Based
Ngmi if you dont hang your kuksa and cast iron pan on the outside of your canvas pack and play lotr music out loud while on the trail
I was just shopping for a ballin Ti cup to match my pot, when...
Shut up and let him do it.
We live in an era where the only way to spend less than forty bucks for a cup is to get the giga negro edition
A toaks titanium cup that one anon gift me in secret santa.
blue plastic tumbler from target ~16-20oz I think
not supported format
sorry no picture because I'm dumb or something
Getting yourself those sweet sweet PFAs.
he doesn't carry a stainless steel vacuum insulated mug
Never gonna make it with a child
uh why would anyone want to make it with a child
A good ol' Kuksa or a simple stainless steel canteen cup. Found some pretty good pieces of wood a while back, and have been planning to make my own Kuksa.
:D
This.
Works good, lasts long time.
I got four of them for cheap. When the first one wears out, I'll get out the next.
Steel version. I have been making then drinking coffee or tea out of it multiple times a day for 2+ years every day. It is absolutely the best 20 bucks I have spent
It turns out “the Science” was leading researches in the wrong direction for the last 16 years by insisting on the aluminum/amyloid hypothesis, faking research, ignoring other studies that didn’t fit the consensus, and withholding grants.

I prefer the green one. Fits snugly on top of a Toacs 750ml.
how many have you lost? i? 3
None. What makes you think i have lost a cup?
This one is probably more than 11 years old. I have a second new one in case this one breaks or melts or whatever.
my orange ones been the only one sticking around, guess the others took their freedom and fled to the forest, but ive also lost 2 nalgenes
Lucky so far. I talk gently with my stuff, that could be it.
i love my gear at home, and, honestly also talk to it sometimes, but i make it clear:
Go is Go
You will NOT eat the aluminium
Honestly great deal. 2 pack for 10 bucks. 18 Oz combined.
Anon you madman, that just might be crazy enough to work!
luv me some decathlon
trash bags works for sleeping sack
Made me kek have a (you)
The ultimate thirst quencher.
a titanium bowl sounds smart
I love this little fosters pot, it's really simple just a beer can with the top cut and the walls rolled down on each other for a light kinda vacuum seal. It's just really comfy any time I use it.
pic didn't upload

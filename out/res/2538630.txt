Does anyone use an Inreach? are the subscriptions worth it? Tell me about the times you have gotten lost anon.
i have one, they are worth it for peace of mind. the only problem is i live in the PNW and heavy tree cover completely kills it. 
it also makes poorfags around here seethe thinking their 25 dollar baofeng will save them when they break their leg on a solo hike
Defend this, LARP anons.
FYI I hike solo in mountainous areas that I am unfamiliar with so I have been heavily debating getting one.
Which subscription do you use? Did you get any of the map packs/are they useful?
i bought a inreach mini, its not really a GPS. just use the basic plan. tethering it to your phone lets you quickly type messages/SOS and check weather which is all i need. I just use my phone as a GPS. unless you spend a ton of money(+700 dollars plus) the GPS ability on these devices is fucking terrible. The unit in the OP photo legitimately had the worst feature set id ever seen, i believe its been discontinued now but it didnt even have topography or trail maps. it just had basic outline of the geography and water so it was basically useless. 
the only real downside of this is that your phone consumes battery at a much higher rate than these dedicated GPS handhelds but i carry multiple 18650s since my headlamp also uses that same battery.
why would u use these anymore? phones ipads etc can do it just fine
it didnt even have topography or trail maps. it just had basic outline of the geography and water so it was basically useless.
Very helpful, thank you. Maybe I'll get the mini and try to find a good separate GPS device with trail maps then.
The iPhone 14 comes with a data plan that includes PLB functionality for a year or two, then you have to pay for it as an added feature or something. So I guess all of the newest phones will have it soon, or already do, and PLB’s will probably die out.
It’s a personal locator beacon, Anon. It’s not just a GPS. These have basic satellite communication, not just reception. They can send a message if you’re lost or injured. That message is received by a service and relayed to the appropriate officials who can launch a search or whatever.
I want map functionality in places with no cell service
a phone will totallly mog every single GPS made nowadays, they are horribly behind the times with tech. They have terrible laggy interfaces. The only upside is if you need to access the device with gloves since tend to focus on physical button navigation. 
there is caveats to the iphone SOS system, it cant be used for texting and weather updates like garmin products but if youre in the market for a new phone its probably a good way to get 2 birds with one stone. 
unless you are a 80 IQ idiot using google maps for navigation then this is not an issue. any good GPS software for a cellphone is going to have the ability to store maps on the device. I keep the entire of north america maps on my phone+any layers i need on my phone. It chews up a couple gigs of storage on my phone but whatever.
Kek, fair enough. I find it desirable to know my location on trails with satellites but it's too bad that these devices are so far behind (and at their current pricepoint).
I made the OP pic for fun and I just found pic rel on youtube
That's not this same guy is it?
I dont usually bring it but I have a long battery life android phone with OsmAnd+ GaiaGPS and AllTrails for finding cool places to go and getting my bearings. OsmAnd is great because you can download entire states offline and it shows trails, forest service roads, power lines, etc plus you can pre-map your routes pretty easily. Would recommend.
your cellphone is receiving your location via satellites too. every single cellphone has a GPS receiver in it. It can do tracking just fine with zero signal
Nope, different one. This one is "Justin Outdoors - Gear Priority"
Thank you for the suggestions!
Maybe I need a better phone but on my last long trip my phone was not helpful at all tracking.
I can defend part of it. She's trying to find her way without relying on the GPS, which is slightly based. People these days have largely lost the brain-muscles we once used to navigate and reckon. They've just atrophied.
it can’t be used for texting
Are you sure? I’m not much of a consumer so I don’t know the ins and outs.
You can text emergency services but noone else. I dont need to call service and rescue very often.its far more important to be able to send messages to my loved ones that im ok every night during overnight trips or be able to get a relative to send a tow truck out to an area if truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere
I had one, I would later sell it.
I got tired of people texting my InReach asking me to check in. I realize now that I don't want to be "In reach".
it's because you're retarded
I carry an emergency beacon because if something goes wrong it dramatically reduces my chances of dying.
I haven’t used one of these, but contemplated getting one after my phone refused to take charge the other day because it was too cold. It had been in a pocket of a down puffy, very occasionally being removed to look at the map. 
I assume that at least one of these things doesn’t use an li-ion battery, and could save me from having to deal with that shit again.
The only upside is if you need to access the device with gloves since tend to focus on physical button navigation.
This is one of the main reasons I bought a Garmin.Touchscreens are pain in the ass.
Also the display is great because you don't need backlight to see it.
I want a watch with a barometer, altimeter and gps.
I always have a handheld GPS and a PLB when I'm /out/. I will sometimes bring an inReach to stay in touch with friends and family.
Whenever I'm hunting (or going /out/ at all), I have five rules: 
Safety, safety, safety, safety, safety. 
Shamelessly borrowed from Jim Shockey, but that doesn't change the validity of the sentiment. Being prepared never hurt anybody, lack of preparedness certainly has. You have to ask yourself what you what is more important:
Being called a wimp on the internet by some rando who probably never goes /out/, or not ending up dead in the wilderness because something happened and you had no way to call for help. For me, the latter is far more important.
That doesn't mean living in fear or never taking risks. Just don't talk yourself out of taking logical safety precautions either due to peer pressure or money.
1. GPS units are significantly more durable than phones. They are better at standing up to impacts and have much better weather resistance.
2. The battery lasts longer; and if you use a unit that takes removable batteries, you can easily replace them.
3. They have more features for navigation.
4. Not everywhere has mobile phone reception.
durability and waterproof was
This could be a concern, but it’s never been an issue for me. I hiked all of the Pinhoti and roughly 3/4 of the Florida trail with an iPhone 7 (back before all of the smartphones were waterproof to some degree). 
battery life
If you’re going for an ultralight base weight or are just weight conscious this is definitely a concern. If you’re taking both a phone and a GPS, then you’re obviously not too concerned with weight. 
more features
Like what? Phone apps are as feature-heavy as the designers want them to be. I find that most have too many features.
muh mobile phone reception
And just like that your entire opinion is discarded.
This
The iPhone 14 comes with a data plan that includes PLB functionality for a year or two***
***only for use in America
I was kind of thinking about getting the iGoy until I read about that, what the fuck is the point if your beacon doesn't work the instant you leave the country? Retard shit.
the only problem is i live in the PNW and heavy tree cover completely kills it.
I haven't found this to be the case at all in the north cascades even in rain and heavy cloud cover... do you mean it kills the gps and text, or just live voice calls?
Only ever bother with gps and text, maybe latency would fuck up audio. 
Or are you in like the Hoh forest or somewhere even denser?
I remember reading this post, I now keep my gps device in a zippered pocket of my pack which actually delays the time it takes to send and receive messages (yes, i've tested it and it is actually slower to having it clipped to your strap); and, while that's not really a major problem when you're /out/ing it in familiar woods, it does pose a threat when out on multi-day ventures or unfamiliar terrain where sending a message within minutes as opposed to after 10-20 minutes, where whomever you're messaging could look away, become distracted, leave their phone, and end up seeing your cry for help many minutes/hours later.
tl;dr I don't give a shit if I or you or anybody has their gps device hooked to the outside of their pack/person, it's probably the best practice for preserving their life despite any appeals to the contrary.
Listen to this anon, OP
4. Not everywhere has mobile phone reception.
Why is this still a talking point in current year? We’ve known since the first generation of smartphones (that’s what, 15 years?) that you don’t need a cell signal to use GPS feature.
Let me know how that works out for you.
I’m really not sure what you’re implying. Are you saying you need a signal from a cellphone tower to use GPS navigation on a smartphone? Use your words.
Inb4 smartphones bad because other reason.
NTA, but a phone GPS isn't nearly as reliable as a dedicated GPS unit.
Really? Post hardware specs.
Also, the point (#4) wasn’t “it’s not reliable because reasons that I can’t or won’t give.” It was that you need cell reception.
My phone GPS doesn't work at points in the mountains, would a dedicated GPS work? I want something I can rely on, plus I'll get a PBL as well
A purpose-built handheld GPS should work anywhere if you are in the open. You shouldn't have any issues in the mountains or alpine country with a dedicated GPS.
Nope
Assuming its the same satellites I'm not sure what the difference would be except maybe better receiver antenna?
If there's terrain occlusion then no tech is going to help that. The device is basically watching a few flickering lights in the sky.
Attention retards! You can plug an antenna into a cellphone!
You mean the antennas which leech signal from everyone around you? Is that what you mean? Because you do not need a GPS antenna so what are you referring to?
You mean the antennas which leech signal from everyone around you?
...no? Do you not know what an antenna is?
Many anons have expressed that phones have poor gps reception when not in range of supplementary signal sources.
The solution is an antenna.
IEEE tested this. The conclusion is cellphone GPS reliability varies greatly even between the same phones. 
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7876317
GPS accuracy isn't tested on cellphones before they ship--they just run a hardware test. 
The real test: if you need anything other than a grid location from a GPS you lack the basic skillsets required to navigate and shouldn't leave trails or roads.
So do you need cell reception or not?
accuracy
So it’s 15m instead of 3m?
Yes. But I always bring and use a map. Main reason why I bring one is so I can explorer places without having to worry about getting completely lost and wandering for too long.
It is launched in way more countries now
Useeless for route finding on the mountain.
Then so is a handheld GPS, seeing as how they both use identical hardware and satellite arrays.
last paragraph
Thank you. Too many people have zero orientation skills. Like what is a compass tier rookies and they won't even try to learn.
I've tried sherpaing this sort before and they just ignore me and check their amazing GPS app they're fond of, because why not come 5hrs to be with nature so you can play with your phone half the time.
I can pinpoint within 5m spots on others' trip videos remotely without compass readings, assuming there's landmarks obv. Its a fun game if you're bored. I could teach a lot, but rarely does anyone care yo learn. Depressing a tad.
I will use GPS on the rare instance I'm turned around in thick featureless woods, thats about it, or to double check a trail junction in same.
It honestly depends our teams carry them for emergencies and they work well but we struggled using them in DRC. Too much tree cover.
You can also use them to track patrols which is nice
i buy a used inreach, subscribe, then sell the device after for thru hikes
and i use a normal PLB with no subscription fucking about the backcountry at home
2 simple reasons why this advice is bad GENERALLY SPEAKING
- normies love to hang their phones over cliffs to take selfies, what if you break or lose your phone? i don't ascribe to boy scout mentality but most normies are very liable to break their phone outdoors eventually. 
- smartphones are not anywhere on the same universe as battery efficient.
its a bad idea for you to do it because normies ars stupid
?????
when giving general advice you need to consider the audience.
I see, I tend to assume the best of a person until I see otherwise.
why did "Jim Shockey" (who?) use a green screen instead of actually going /out/?

Mobile devices have gps...
He’s said “get help,” Anon.
Several phones have satelite connections.
Which ones? I know the newest iPhone (I think it just came out last year) advertised it as a brand new feature.
would still rather take my shitty old thuraya than a meme sat phone.
Some random europhone also has it. I know im reaching here but at the end of the day a sat module can easily be connected to a shart phone.
say module
I’ve never heard of such a thing. Post link? Sounds interesting.
Why do faggots insist on telling flaming mandril ass lies?
do a thing
”I don’t believe you”
Ok
Mobiles devices are reliant on the internet to interpret GNSS coordinates into a direction or bearing thats populates your map app unless you pay for some premium subscription app
Dedicated GPS devices have that baked in and can changes course or directions on the fly without the internet
Being able to reach out anywhere with a view of the sky is a major burden lifted
Everywhere I go has cell service
you are not really /out/ then
Iridium is the first one that comes to mind.
Mobiles devices are reliant on the internet to interpret GNSS coordinates
Dedicated GPS devices have that baked in and can changes course or directions on the fly without the internet

I need you to not opine on topics you are inadequately informed about.
Sorry bro, but you’re just straight up wrong.
I bought this. Should I have gotten the inreach instead?
See: >>2540855
The market is going to get interesting when the rocket autist gets his big shiny sky dilater flying regularly, the next gen starlink sats are going to include lower baud G5 cell reception through T-Mobile:
https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-to-serve-t-mobile-phones-with-second-gen-starlink-satellites
My buddy went down solo riding Idaho BDR, inreach was the only reason he got outta that shit alive and it's why I'm gonna snag one when I start taking my bike into the sticks this spring.
I think anything on an ATV or 4x4 would be more dangerous in terms of being stranded and unreachable, especially in the western half of the US. You can get pretty far from civilization and any kind of minor breakdown could be a disaster. I hiked two days on a sprained ankle and it wasn’t the end of the world. But if I was 30 miles out with a flat tire or something I’d be fucked.
You really shouldnt be going anywhere without the kit to survive...
I’m on the fence about this unit. It has “in reach” non emergency texting and emergency beacon with 2 way com. Also replace my seperate dog training collar, and my gps (phone does not work where I hunt at all). It’s almost 1500 with 2 collars but I really am thinking about it. The only downside is you can’t use it to make a virtual electric fence, you can make a boundary line that alerts you if the dog leaves but it won’t auto-shock them like some of the other brands. Upside is everything else. Never owned a Garmin anything but they seem well built
I have an older model I use on two huskies. Its great. Geo fence is hands on, thats all. When it beeps, you manually correct. Just keep the unit by you while training. A smart dog learns pretty quick. Also it has hella range. Easily 5 miles here in a very heavily wooded area of hilly terrain. Great battery life. Half a day on the handheld, day plus on the collar depending on setup. Less transmitting means longer life. The only downside Ive found is map sucks, as in it only shows terrain zoomed out to like an inch equals a mile. It can get you places, but dont expect it to show the terrain or trails. Theres also a lighter/smaller collar for smaller dogs.
I assume the posted version has added inreach features?
Yes this one has in reach, Birds Eye view, better screen but still has buttons the reviews say they fixed the UI slot with this one. Just the price.
i just have a unit that can do only text/weather report but it does have gps. 
tree cover makes it difficult for these iridium devices to communicate, in the PNW its so thick i cant get a signal. I will run the diagnostics on the unit under a variety of tree cover and it has to be pretty thin for it to work. 
GPS is received via a different antenna on a 1 way signal on a band that is not hindered by tree cover too much.
who?
Jim Shockey is arguably the most accomplished hunter alive today. He has hunted in almost every country where it is currently legal to hunt, and has taken hundreds of species of game. Shockey is a true hunter and explorer who has hunted in places that most people wouldn't even contemplate visiting (Pakistan, Chad, Somaliland, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, just to name a few).
use a green screen instead of actually going /out/?
Because that picture is from a photo shoot for an Outdoor Life Magazine article.
So do you need cell reception or not?
Without cell reception, reliability is questionable. And when you could be faced with a life or death situation, that's unacceptable.

stop being fucking stupid.
A cellphone with an antenna has the reliability and accuracy of a dedicated gps.
That hasn't been my experience. I have been /out/ with a mobile phone and a GPS on me at the same time in places without reception, and the GPS was more accurate.
with an antenna
I got the new iPhone 14 max with satellite. I also use the Gaia maps app so I can track exactly where I am even with zero reception or service.
No paper maps are more fun
you got a loicense to operate that?
Tell me about the times you have gotten lost anon.
Has never happened anon. Sometimes I will lose society for a while, but I have never lost myself.
Based all who wonder are not lost chad
nu-out will seethe at this this, but you're right
is factually incorrect
"youre right"
What did he mean by this
U up? ;) I just fell 15m and shattered my tibia, maybe you could come check it out ;P thx
It means you'll seethe at it, because you don't any better and don't care to educate yourself.
The entire world was explored with maps and a compass. I might think about buying one if I was going somewhere notorious for hikers getting lost like the area around the AT or that forest in Australia where people always get lost and die. I live in a place with a lot of Identifiable mountains and rivers so I don't have any need for one. I'm generally pretty confused when I see people hiking popular trails with them. I also notice that a lot of the stories I read about hikers who get in over their heads and die (like that banker woman in NH) they have a PLB with them. If I were to get mauled by a bear or fall and break my leg I would prefer to die like a man.
You can fix it right now
With how many pipe bombs?
those sorts of GPS units (like Foretrex too although that's even more basic) are really designed to be used with a physical topo map. They're just good for getting your exact location and orienting you to a point or following a route but not for route planning or looking at your surrounding area. The ones with digital topo maps are nice but generally cost a shit ton more and it means if the thing dies or breaks then you don't have maps at all (same with a phone, carry a physical map and compass too for god's sake anons, it's a few hundred extra grams).
I go hiking solo and the main thing I'm worried about is snake bites and broken leg/ankle. I do want to get an inreach, but the price and subscription is a bit high for the amount of /out/ I do.
because you dont know any better
Oh, my bad. I forgot to do my indoctrination session last week.
Can you launch a full search and rescue operation for me plz? Yeah I just sprained my ankle I have water for a couple of days but I can't walk back. Oh, it'll be 20k dollars plus tip? Guess I'll pay up since it's my only option and I can't just text my buddy to come pick me up...
the battery lasts twice as long and it tracks more accurately at speed when it's oriented properly. If I keep it in my backpack the battery dies from constantly searching for maps and re-orienting.
I don't know why these idiots need a GPS for day hikes, though, I only bring one to places where I would actually need one in an emergency.
based
If I keep it in my backpack the battery dies from constantly searching for maps and re-orienting.
You couldnt just turn it off when youre not using it?
The only downside Ive found is map sucks, as in it only shows terrain zoomed out to like an inch equals a mile. It can get you places, but dont expect it to show the terrain or trails.
Can't you change the level of detail in the settings? If I remember correctly there is some setting on the gpsmapp 66 for example.
If you zoom out on the map battery lasts much longer or if you use other page. Sure if you need to navigate it's not an option but if you just tracking it's good.
Zero my troon friend! 
Just a plastic bag, a short hose, some duct tape, and a party store helium tank.
I don't think GPS will even be useful in places like k2
Like you would have already planned so much in advance there's no mistaking the giant ridge you're going up and down
Like you would have already planned so much in advance there's no mistaking the giant ridge you're going up and down
Most fanous stories about mountain climbing feature AT LEAST one instance of a veteran climber mistaking landmarks.
You have plenty of time after a snake bite to make it to the hospital. Unless you're multiple days hike away from the road system in an area with a lot of snakes, you're gonna be fine.
They're only worth it if you go in areas that are bumfuck nowhere. If you're hiking the AT, and you're not retarded enough to get lost, someone's going to stumble upon you before you die, probably. If you're in Bumfuck WV, hiking near the NRQZ, a broken leg is almost a death sentence. I've been in National Forest areas that I haven't seen other people in over a week, and that's in the spring. As modern tech bullshit as it is, bring your phone, bring an external battery, and bring an SOS system if you're going somewhere that others aren't. And for god's sake, get the insurance if you aren't on public land.
Ok lol xD sending the chopper :p sowwy that happened to you

Expensive phones get 3 days... MOST phones don't even come that close.
So, again, you're going to tell more lies because you cant stop yourself.
Celltards don't understand that the accuracy of Cellphone GPS is significantly improved by tower triangulation augmentation and so, when you go out of network, cellphone location accuracy drops significantly.
99% of cellphones use the cheapest GPS receiver-hardware possible because they know most users will use the augmented accuracy from the towers. 
ALL advertised cellphone location accuracies are based on A-GPS not stand-alone GPS. Celltards always lie about this.

The lowest sub (15 bucks?) gives you access to all the functions plus a few texts and unlimited pre-written "check in" messages. Even without the sub, the devices can still be used for maps.
I carry a pld in remote areas, but leave it home on less remote hikes. the inreach mini is like ~100g so it's hard to justify not carrying one in remote areas. handy for weather updates as well, but I haven't used it for nav
Get repeatedly outed for lying so resort to low IQ bant: Celltard argument C
Called it. continue--owning you bitches is easy , you do it for me.
Anyone who needs more than a grid location from a GPS lacks the competence to go off trail. I carry my GPS with me but I almost never use it because I can read a map.
Anyone who needs more than a grid location from a GPS lacks the competence to go off trail.
I'm with you. The inreach mini is great in this respect as it's much more a plb than a gps imo.
I don't like lithium ion batteries
The are notorious for poor preformance in cold weather and have reliability issues regarding charge-discharge-lifespan. One of the major advantages of hand held GPS is the ability to swap out batteries. All of my out electronics take the same batteries.
fair points. I've never had an issue with it, it's pretty easy to manage. but yeah interchangeable batteries is cool
outed for lying
Ive gotta say, ive encountered plenty of arguments in my life. But "nuh uh, ur a liar" immediately followed by zero argument or evidence has gotta be one of the weirdest tacticts ive encountered.
Who hurt you?
I've got clinical amnesia so you better fucking believe I'm never doing a solo backwoods trek without a GPS unit. All it takes is a bad night setting up camp and I wake up not even realizing I'm 10 miles from my car
That said, USGS and trail maps + compass and notebook will still be 1000x more reliable and dare I say FUN compared to staring at a screen to get you to where you wanna go. Plus a compass doesn't run out of batteries in a worst-case survival situation
Why they gotta be so goddamn expensive
Pretty pathetic bant desu
Tell us the line about getting a week out of a cell battery, I need another giggle.
full tilt cope
I accept your concession
take your meds skitzo
full blown tr*nnie cope
LMAO
c-c-cope!
take your meds skitzo
Lmao look at him cope, mayhaps a degre of seethe?
tree cover makes it difficult for these iridium devices to communicate, in the PNW its so thick i cant get a signal.
Oh I was thinking you said you couldn't get a GPS signal (receiving only) - you mean a communications signal (broadcast is needed). 
That kinda makes sense. 
Makes me think I should actually test the broadcast case - I assumed that if GPS was working the communication out would be fine... 
I don't know why these idiots need a GPS for day hikes, though, I only bring one to places where I would actually need one in an emergency.
I lately bring mine on a ton of even easy/well traveled hikes. Mostly since I already bothered to buy it, so I might as well use it and learn it well. Better to be prepared than not, etc etc. I also over pack water and a filter, just too many years of boy scouts ingrained it in me. 
Plus metrics tracking (speed but mostly vertical gain) is interesting to know. 
Good way to shake-down test your gear - I didn't realize until an easy hike that battery will significantly discharge over a few weeks if left off in a cold garage - now I know to top it off overnight before trip, vs just trying to top it off on car charger during drive out to trailhead. Much happier having that learning on a pedestrian hike than a real trip. 
I don't think GPS will even be useful in places like k2
eh, if you can geo fence your expected route, and have it beep at if you leave route, it might help you correct if you start to fuck up your route due to impaired decision making from low oxygen or start of hypothermia, or just some kind of panic. 
Defense in depth and all that.
I didn't come into this thread with an opinion, but the celltards are fucking annoying. I'm thinking GPS unit and no cellphone is the way to go
Nobody asked
take your meds skitzo
Celltard comes into a Inreach thread
Spams complete bullshit about cellphones
Your lack of self awareness is beyond impressive.
Truly amazing. This is quite honestly the best celltards have to offer. Pathetic
Not him but I'm also in the PNW. The GPS satellites are transmit only, there are more of them, and they are in a higher orbit than the Iridium. Even on shit days I have around 9 GPS satellites "visible" 
The communications goes through iridium and only connects to one Satallite at a time...it's more like a cell service but the towers move instead of the phone.
You're 100% wrong. If anything you need more waypoints on K2 as awful weather can hit at any time and in whiteout all you have is the GPS and compass.
Delusional
Half of the posts you quoted are in response to 'celltards' not from them you retard
You're awful at this. Truly pathetic. Tell the lie about cellphone battery life again--I need a giggle.
Stop responding to the troll
Anyone who points out that cellphones have shit battery life (especially in cold weather), inferior out of network GPS performance and aren't rugged at all is a troll
Indeed. We got a big brain here.
tell a lie about
you already proved yourself wrong kiddo, try again
No this thread is shit and in rolling in it
points out that cellphones have shit battery life (especially in cold weather)
What is a pocket, what are settings, what are battery packs. Did you think posting some faggots study where he used the factory "battery saver mode" proved you right? Lmao even.
inferior out of network GPS performance
We already had this discussion retard, its called an antenna.
rugged at all is a troll
Oh youre one of those kids who has a broken screen 99% of the time because youve never hears of a fucking case.
Get fucked idiot
Stop responding to the troll
No! I dont wanna!
Truly pathetic. 
Calling me out for lying is trolling: REEEE
fucking absolutly priceless. Look at how vapid your "argument" is...truly amazing..lamo
Here is my FAVORITE question you're incapable of answering: where do you out? lmao
Being smarter than an 80IQ celltard is trolling
Absolutely reddlt.
LAMO
pathetic
Here is why you're lying about out of network GPS (shocking I know, people actually researched it and shokingly you're obviously lying):
Accuracy of iPhone Locations: A
Comparison of Assisted GPS, WiFi and
Cellular Positioning
Paul A Zandbergen
Why you're a liar about batteries--this is very researched actually.
An Analysis of Power Consumption in a Smartphone--Aaron Carroll
Lie more though, you're so cringe it's absolutely amazing.
OSMand (get the pro version for free from F-droid) with the map style set to topo has done everything I need it to in the Idaho backcountry. Waypoints, up to date trails and in my time hiking hunting and generally enjoying the outdoors I have literally never had an issue with finding GPS on my phone. Far from any cell towers too. Sat-phones have no competition for emergencies and the battery life is notable but the inreach I had the chance to use was unintuitive and they aren't exactly cheap.
Do whatever you want.
I was just looking at GPSMap models over the weekend. Previously I've taken my phone out with me because the GPS works well enough to get me back to a road and it's not like battery life is an issue, but I'd like to be able to send text messages to the wife when I'm out for multiple days with no reception.
"youre lying about gps! (In 2023)""
posts research from 2009 to prove it
"youre lying about batteries! (In 2023)"
posts article from 2010 to prove it
Holy shit, it's the "priceless" guy again, making another dumb argument. See >>2555878
Can't counter any of the arguments
truly pathetic. So not only can you not substantiate anything you say but your counter to the scientific evidence is to ignore it--absolutely priceless
Where do you out again? Lamo--fess up you're the Poland guy. 
It's all the same person
LMAO--triggered! Yes, it's all the same person in every thread on every board ... I can't get enough of how retarded you are... 
yes, 
it's priceless
Worth it for the SOS button.
The mapping/navigation is useful, but I wouldn't spend the money for just that.
Relationship Pro Tip: If you want to go on solo trips, get one of these and use the tracking so your significant other can see where you are. It's safer for you (both in terms of health and avoiding arguments with your wife)
The company that I work for purchased Garmin GPSMap 66i's to replace our aging stock of 64s' and DeLorme inreaches and I must say that although having a two in one package is nice we've run into some problems. Namely the fact that you cannot swap batteries on the 66i. We had several instances of 66i's die on our guys in the field due to the cold (also because they left it in 10 minute tracking mode) and other than a battery bank they have no way to charge them. 
Personally the 66i has been good to me, but I also know how to use the device and how to keep it functioning, we dont always get the brightest guys sampling for us.
This is a good tip anon.
you cant counter my arguments if i ignore your counter
True, that is true, good point.
Would you perhaps like to provide RELEVANT research? Relating to technology of this FUCKING DECADE????
Yeah and I'll probably switch to them if the pricing isn't retarded
I make &lt;15 minutes of calls a month and still have to pay $35 fucking dollars for it
I have an iPhone 11. AllTrails works just fine in the backcountry here with downloaded maps. Never have gotten lost using it. 
Use a Zoleo to communicate with family on trips. 
The cold is a bane to lithium without question.
the cold is bane
For you
This. Pockets and insulators kill the lithium scaremonger.
The fact that you cant counter even old data is truly pathetic.
You don't even know what model number your battery is or what part number your GPS is--lamo. Fun fact: none of that shit has been updated in decades retard.
So basically, you're lying AND you cant even debunk old data. truly pathetic.
I love it when east coasters call what they have "back country" If you get lost you literally wak 30 minutes in a straight line and you'll hit a road or an established trail.
I have to keep it warm to work
Telling the truth about known problems with lithium ion is scare mongering
Its amazing how oblivious you are to how retarded you sound.
hurr durr cold bad for battery
hurr durr keeping battery warm bad
I just came here to make batman jokes; what's your excuse?
I don't need an excuse to know what I'm talking about.
Well you haven't said anything about sucking dick, so we're pretty far out of your wheelhouse
Why would i have to counter inapplicable data more than "its not relevant"?
You don't even know what model number your battery is 
Yes i do
or what part number your GPS is
Yes i do
none of that shit has been updated in decades retard.
Yes it has
Its telling that you cant do anything but cite outdated research and call people liars...
shirking known solutions to a problem in favor of complaining is scaremongering
Yes...
Pathetic.
So we've established 
Cell batteries are shit
Cell GPS out of network is bad
and Cellphones aren't rugged
And your counter is, quite literally, It isn't because I say so reeeeee (in squaky, puberty voice).
god damn you retards are truly amazing. What was those model numbers again? Wait, you don't actually know because you're a liar and won't post them--lamo.
Where do you /out/ again...oh wait, you won't post that either.
Lamo--keep lying and dodging and lying, that's all you celltards are capable of.
Continue.
why'd you bring that up, anon? is there something on your mind that you want to know more about?
I know you are but what am I
Way to take it on the chin, champ
so we've established
Astounding how you think you can just hand wave away the refutation of you """evidence"""
Provide relevant sources retard, ill wait.
He argues like a middle schooler, its amazing.
I have to mock someone for being younger than me
chooses middleschool
Lamo, you truly are that pathetic 
I'm sorry, you had some fact somewhere supported by evidence in this thread? I must have missed it, link it would you?
dodge, lie, seeth: incoming
In all seriousness its pretty amazing how garmin manages to make people pay iPhone money for technology straight from 2005.
People peak where they peak, I guess. He probably misses lording over the jungle gym with his vast intellect, kek
Muh dick bant is sadly the best he's been able to do on 4chan. It's all he's got, cut him some slack eh? He's trying his best.
Come now, champ, humiliating yourself more is embarrassing. Try using your big boy words and explaining what has changed in the past decade with lithium ion batteries.
I need more laughs so indeed continue proving me correct.
Yes, I'm obviously smarter than you, but don't be intimidated I'm trying to help.
Are you retarded? You literally used argumentation that a child would find juvenile. How the fuck can i be mocking you for being younger than me, how the fuck am i supposed to know how old you are????????
I'm sorry, you had some fact somewhere supported by evidence in this thread? I must have missed it, link it would you?
I dont, and neither do you :)
When when they act like apple fagd, its pretty easy to see why it works.
I can't counter any of your arguments therefore ad hominim
Your stupidity is endearing. Go on--keep not debunking anything I've posted (because you can't) and crying about how you got owned hard.. 
lmao.
The irony is Iphone is 2000s tech that people pay double market price for because of the brand name and superficial features.
Hint AM. 721-00051-A is the same, tired, regurgitation of a 90s garmin reciever for 10x the price.
TMW you realize that the guy trolling the thread isn't actually an insufferable faggot supporting Garmin, but is instead an Apple employee trying to turn people away from handheld GPS devices by spamming pretentious ad hominem
Well played, applefag. You almost had me convinced to stay away from GPS devices altogether.
I literally countered your argument and personally insulted you :)
Now post a relevant source
Is this apple employee in the room with you right now?
Weak
Cry about it
My brother in christ, are you high right now
coping this hard
I'm still going to buy a GPS, apple anon. I don't care how obnoxious you are.
how often do people accidentally bump the SOS button?
malding yourself into consooming
Lmao even
if you want it as a life saving device it's fine. I reach mini has other features but also costs money for a subscription
Galileo and beidou were not available on smartphones in 2009 so things have definitely changed since then. I'm not the guy you're arguing with so don't reee at me
I look like this.
I scuba dive and use an inreach mini 2. Granted the thing does NOT work underwater, I figure any casualty underwater while scuba diving is fatal if you can't recover and two if I'm fucked up at the surface or sweapted out to sea I have an emergency means of batphoning home as PLB. Worse case at least my family has a corpse they can recover.
Also yeah the inreach systems are primarily a PLB they have GPS but that just a standard feature in any PLB made in the last decade.
Also if you want to use it on a plant carrier or any MOLLE webbing you have to get a chain of adapters which imo is fuckin high kikery from Garmin. For me with the underwater case it was underwater case > back clip>slide>MOLLE adapter all separate accessories.

This is the only post in here worth reading 
good job anon
Best post
contains literal lies
Not to be confused with figurative lies
Unironcially yes
Only good post in this thread.
On the internet you're homosexual &amp; pussy for bringing a parachute to parachute jumping.
While out of the pod nobody ever called me gay or pussy for wearing or using any and every sport related gear or even gimmick.
In fact only ever received mires of my cycle helm when cycling, slim speedos during swimming, walking poles when hiking etc.
That should tell you people are dishonest irl
It takes courage to leave the pod and that's the fear being projected on the internet.
It's too obvious on this board when all of it comes from people that clearly never go out.
It's like when the internet dwellers join irl, they overcome those fears.
I've been tempted to buy one of these handheld GPS devices for years. Aside from being able to send an SOS in an emergency, having a GPS for navigation sounds super convenient. I've tried using GPS apps like AllTrails/Gaia but they just don't seem to work well on my S10e and I ended up going back to just consulting a map when needed. 
The problem is that Garmin just seems like one of those niche companies that lack competition. They're still relying on the MIPS architecture which is close to 40 years old and slow as fuck, and they're charging a lot of money for it. And they get away with it because basically nobody else is making handheld GPS devices. I'm conflicted.
Gets owned
still doesn't answer any of the questions or counter any points at all
Multiple posters debunk celltard retardation
Pretends it didn't happen
lmao
Which are lies? 
Use your words like a big boy--it's hard for you obviously but you can do it.
They're not worth it for your average /out/ poster who never hikes in consequential terrain and never ventures too deep into backcountry areas
if I wanted a dedicated GPS unit , I'd get a cheap "tough" smartphone off AliExpress, put OSMTrack / OsmAnd+ on it, and disable everything else that might possibly drain the battery

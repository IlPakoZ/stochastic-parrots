AS I CREEP
PICTURE EVERY HUMAN THAT I SEEK
SLABS OF HUMAN MEAT
CAUSE MY KIDS GOTTA EAT
blocks your path
Just pick em off and pop them in your mouth. Hiking snack.
This is tangentially related. Does pic related look like a bed bug? It's on a seam of a mattress
I call it the Summer Slam when I get a tick bite, a mosquito bite, a bee sting, and a poison ivy rash in the same summer. So far this year I got the poison ivy already. Who /Slamming/ with me this summer?
The cockroach, the cockroach,
Can’t walk anymore
Because it doesn’t have,
Because it’s missing
Two little back legs.
People they say the cockroach
Is a very small animal
But when it gets into a house,
It’ll soon be the master of it all.
When the lights come on,
The cockroaches scatter.
I take it you do this regularly?
poison ivy and mosquito bites are 100% guarantee every summer for my part of the country, tick bites are also super common but I find them quick too, but I almost never get stung by a bee
So squishy. Like Gushers.
That's kinda gross, anon!
I don't get how anyone has that much of a problem with poison ivy. There's poison ivy all over the place where I go /out/ and I've never once got a rash from it. Do you roll around in random bushes without looking like a dog?

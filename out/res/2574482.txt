How irresponsible is it to try to summit a peak where there's a 40% chance I'll need to get rescued out of? Planning to sumit capitol peak next weekend by myself. I got myself some rescue insurance just in case, I wanna feel bad but I mean, I'm paying for it right? They won't be doing it for free. I'm unprepared experience wise, not gear wise, my gear has been carefully selected and I'll be carrying some high end gear and a locator beacon, so I doubt the elements will kill me, I also know the basics of camping and hiking, I'm just now sure how much of a technical hike this will be. I'll report back next Monday, if I don't make it out you'll probably hear from me in the local news.
How do you know your chance of failure is 40%?
Mt. Trans
looks easy tbqh
40% irresponsible

fucking retard insurance is not a teleport
you realize that right
When the weather is good (FOR THE ENTIRE DAY), do Longs Peak first, it will let you know if you are ready. Don't do it solo and wear a helmet for falling rock.

Pretty irresponsible. Even if you have insurance the negative publicity around a rescue contributes to the narrative that these peaks and trails are "too" dangerous and people should be forbidden from climbing them for their own good. If you really think the chance you'll need a rescue is 40% then you should not go ahead with the climb.
Pretty irresponsible
Also probably terrifying why do you want to do this?
In a related but different note i was walking wity my dog around some cliffs by my house and decided if he were to fall id probably go down after him even if i couldnt get back up since it would be easier to get someone to come and recue me than just him
To play doubles abacus..
It's their job to rescue you and they probably enjoy it
This year on the Arizona trail down by Miller’s Peak some retarded Australian guy had to be rescued. Decided to summit Miller in late February after a storm and ended up cutting fresh tracks through 2 feet of snow, lost his shoe while postholing without realizing it then called the rangers. They had a Blackhawk from the base near Tucson come skyhook his fatass off the mountain. Everyone relentlessly made fun of him for it but hey he got to ride in a helicopter for part of his trip so that’s cool
All the expensive gear in the world will not save your life if you are a retard. Build up your experience with easier mountains.
Can't imagine more embarrassing thing than needing a rescue on a hike.
i feel the same, id rather die when /out/ than call for a rescue and have to be publicly humiliated
You should have a better plan and be more prepared if 40% is your psychological estimate of failing to climb the mountain. If you are prepared and experienced, you should have confidence. It's in your head really, but you should just be practical and realistic, put in the work, see it through, and it's done. There's a process to doing things, you stick to the process and you get it done.
In mountain climbing, you have established routes. If you keep a decent pace, depending on the elevation, you can calculate how long the journey will take and just complete it. No weird guesswork or estimating like this, you just have the preparation and confidence and you do it. You keep it simple.
NO RECALL OR INTERVENTION CAN WORK IN THIS PLACE
THERE IS NO ESCAPE
You understand it is May and Capitol Peak is not going to be dry like in that picture right?
Glad someone mentioned this.
Capitol Peak is supposedly the toughest 14er in Colorado, some say the toughest 14er to hike in the lower 48. It’s snowed until late June, maybe longer this year. The approach trail is about 9 miles and they say even that is a little challenging. 
The fact that OP is asking this on /out/ is the most ridiculous part. I say go for it lmao.
I was there 2 weeks ago and it wasn't that bad. My ugly fat girlfriend managed to reach the summit last year and it was her second time hiking.
Yeah even the Grand Mesa here still has snow on it and it's only 10k in elevation.
gahDAMN that's a ass
Colorado anon here, just do an easier 14er that's non technical. Capitol Peak is a class 4 route, which means you are just not getting up the mountain without climbing equipment. As others have noted, the peaks still have snow on them, which means you're just not summiting them without extensive specialist equipment and knowledge on how to use it. The roads to most of these mountains aren't even open until June. Wait to climb a 14er until June and find one that you can climb without specialist equipment. There is not a shortage of non technical 14ers in this state.
if I don't make it out you'll probably hear from me in the local news.
We won't, retards die in the mountains all the time out here, because they're not prepared. I have a friend who did search and rescue and quit because he was sick of rescuing total morons.
Imagine how irresponsible it would be to intentionally put yourself in a situation that will require you to get rescued. Then take 40% of it. Still pretty damn irresponsible desu.
Either carry nothing to stay light or carry full climbing/escape gear 
climbing dick here
Women didn't have asses like this when I was a boy. What happened? Hormones in the food and water? Obesity?
photoshop
I got myself some rescue insurance just in case,
Yeah lmao this guy thinks escape ropes just work instantly
This has got to be a bait post; no one is this stupid lol. In case it's not, go do Quandary or Bierstadt or something. And make sure you know how to use snow shoes / ice spikes.
Also agreed that you should at least do Long's first. If you can't do the narrows / homestretch you sure as shit won't make it across the knife's edge or to the top.

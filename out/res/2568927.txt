Are camping/survival courses worth it? What are your experiences?
I think I'd do better having someone irl teaching me than I would reading off a book by myself.
But some of the prices I'm seeing in Sweden are a little steep for me ($400 for 1 night and 2 days, $1.5k for 13 nights)
are camping, programming, gunsmithing, brain surgery, etc. courses worth it
only if you're the type of person who can't absorb all the free information in various formats, but somehow mysteriously learn well in a classroom
I kind of want to take one. I feel like I've actually lost a lot of outdoor knowledge I learned in scouts after college, despite working in an outdoor field now. I don't remember most knots, I'm terrible at building fires, can barely remember how to build a shelter, and frequently forget basic things like plant ID and even tool use. I want to improve again, but I'm not sure where to start, since going from the beginning of tenderfoot seems like overkill.
imagine paying $400/night to go outdoors
Nigga is it that hard to put on your boots and go outdoors?
I haven't done one but I'm pretty much certain you'd be better off putting that money towards more time in the woods. These are skills you learn by doing so get out there and do them. Choose a skill - read up on it then go out and practice it. If you really want find a campsite with mobile reception so you can revise the skills on the spot.
go outside and spend the night
damn, I wish I had x and y was completely useless on this trip
buy x and go back outside, leave y at home
nice, x was really useful this time, but I should've brought z
trying to optimize with no experience is retarded, just fucking go outside
If you wanna camp in 6000m, in freezing environment, or in really remote location, then yes, otherwise it's just for fun, and you never be in need to use it.
whats with the netty pots?
what exactly would you learn in one of those classes that you cant learn by experience? go out and experiment its not like going on a 1 night hike is likely to kill you
Has anybody here taken NOLS wilderness first aid / first responder / medicine courses and was it worthwhile?
I need to get a WFR scheduled this year. Been putting it off for too long.
One of my businesses is in outdoor training, and even if you're "experienced" there's always value in learning new techniques or refreshing some topics you may not use/practice often. 
As an instructor it's always fun seeing how proficient students do things. I've learned a few techniques and little tips from students that I pass on now. One of my favorite things is getting to see and use different (expensive) gear that I don't have, but might consider after that training. 
New students are often overwhelmed with the information and situation; even if they retain 10% of what I taught, that's still 10% more than they had before. 
$400 for 1 night and 2 days
That's not too bad at all. Most of the courses I teach are between $500 (3-day/24hr recreational-user course) and $1200/day (2- to 4-day industrial-occupational (job pays for you to attend) courses) per student.
Foldable cups are insanely popular even though the space saving is like 1.7cm.

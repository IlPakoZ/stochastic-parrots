Why do you go out, /out/?
to hike and sketch the back of my thumb.
its pretty and quiet compared to the car-ridden urban jungle
to sniff stinky sweaty girls
Pretty much this, I lived in Vegas for 6 years and had enough. Married my gf and moved to an /out/ location next to a small town. Everyone is so nice to each other and things are so peaceful here, I see deer on my property almost daily I'm looking at cows in a field off in the distance right now, it's amazing how good life can be without niggers.
Because I enjoy it. Every time I post this, it makes /out/ seethe uncontrollably. So I'm going to keep posting it. 
Me too, anon. Me too.
I hate the subhumans too anon. Sometimes you just have to get away from the products of capitalism.
I just enjoyed nature there’s a weird serenity that I feel when I’m in nature. That I don’t feel in the city. I feel like actually belong there.
because /in/ sucks
To shred the mountain
Cause I find people, even the morally decent who align with my tism well exhausting. And most people have willingly gone monkey brain anymore. Holy crap just shut up about what you fuck and who you drink and let me do my job!
Also animals are cute innawoods
It's almost like we didn't evolve in cities or something
Because I don't need to be intoxicated or stoned to tolerate life in the outdoors like I do in society
It's fun
Mainly to get away from other people for a while.
while it's sometimes difficult to get off your ass and get /out/, when you do, you never regret it and crave to get /out/ more often... so let's all fuck off now
adrenaline addiction
Because I already live and work /out/ so it's no hassle. Driving back into civilization is a pain in the arse that I still try and do every couple of years to get Culturally Enriched and catch up with old friends, but it turns out to be a miserable experience every time because of the noise and the squalor and interactions with junkies or feral kids that try to steal or wreck my shit. I stayed /out/ because I like having a small cottage on an acre of land with all the doors and windows open for less than half the price of a fortified shoebox in Little Somalia. I'll gladly fist cows and do physical labour if it means living ~300kms from the nearest pawn shop and welfare office where people have to work for a living or die
i don't really know i started with hiking with my dog and it completely spiraled out of control into full on alpinism and now i think i'm just curious to see how far i can push my luck
to get to your mom's house
I'm sorry, the road to OP's mom's house has far too much traffic to be considered /out/.
Need another season of cute girls go fishing so bad you don't even know bros
For our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Why, what's wrong with going out?
The peace and quiet. Sitting around a fire at night during fall or winter is something that'll never get old
Unironically this is why I hate jeep fags. 
I heard a guy once say, “son, let’s go climb that mountain” to his little boy and off they drove on a dirt road in a jeep. 
I only backpack and don’t get steeper than scrambling and that shit is super cringey
Well it's not really a socially acceptable thing, is it?
Should he be walking?
Yes? You aren't /out/ when you're /in/side a vehicle. Is RV camping in a KOA /out/ too now?
Not everyone lives a block away from a national park, anon. I drive to the woods so I can make the most efficient use of my free time.
Checked. I'm so sad the lifts are closed, I'm really contemplating buying a splitboard.

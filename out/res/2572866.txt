what are the most scenic places in America?
planning a road trip this summer, going to visit as many states as I can
trying to avoid touristy or gimmicky shit though, i'm more interested in remote beauty
what are the essential /out/ spots?
You should visit yellowstone and the grand canyon in August.
for New Mexico generally I'd look up at Jemez in the northwest but there's a lot of other spots too
Deadwood/Black Hills area, seemed most people there were visiting from in state.
basically, the entire outside edge states are pretty, i e California, Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Washington, and whatever the fuck they have over on the East Coast. Practically nothing of value worth visiting in the middle bit because the bulk of it is just flat, empty plains. Colorado is neat, but it pales in comparison to places like California and Arizona. Even Lousiana just has miles and miles and miles of gorgeous swamps and old growth forests. The ugliest place in the entire country is Southern Colorado; anywhere else is pretty in one way or another.
Yellowstone, though you have to go off peak season or you'll be stepping over Indians and Chinese.
Yosemite, same as above except you'll be dealing with dirtbag rock climbers year round.
Grand Canyon, also off peak.
Zion, off peak.
The interior of Alaska...go any time.
Eastern Sierra. Black Canyon. The Winds.
Plenty of what you're looking for in the desert but the heat of the summer will wear you down. That's the best time to be in the mountains. But if you can make it to Southern Utah by June I'd check that out as well.
All of it.
All of it is beautiful, from the mountains to the prairies, from the coasts to the deserts, from the lakes to the rivers and caves.
Many natural wonders in national parks, but the whole expanse of the land and wilderness is nice, yet each part is very different. The Eastern half of the country is forested, the West is mountains and plains, then more mountains and forests.
Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, all good ones mentioned. Redwood forests, beaches, a lot of pine forest. I live out in the pine forest in Appalachia in the sticks, good hunting and fishing. But I've traveled all over the country and the parks and cities. It is a huge area, so it's hard to discuss just one area. Virginia is really pretty with the hills and woods, and you have the Pacific Crest Trail as well as the Appalachian Trail.
There is also the much overlooked Continental Divide National Scenic Trail that runs through Rocky Mountain National Park. These long hiking trails have camping and towns along the way, there are seasons when groups of people hike them and offseasons without much people on them. It is like El Camino de Santiago in Spain.
The Rocky Mountains are very nice for hiking and camping in the warmer months with the snow melted. Winter camping and mountain climbing is a whole different thing, but there is a lot of that as well out there.
i'm from washington so i've spent my whole life in WA OR CA already, the mountain west and southeast seem very interesting to me though
i know yellowstone is inherently touristy, especially in summer but it's a pretty big place, there's gotta be plenty of remote hiking trails and sites that aren't flooded with foreigners if you know a little about /out/
good suggestions, i'll give them more of a look

most people do not go more than a mile from their car. Its easy to find solitude in Yellowstone even in summer
Not all. There are very few remaining untouched prairies and they are generally off limits. You aren't going to be able to sleep out like a cowboy anywhere. The Midwest has nothing but agriculture. Unless you own property here there's literally nowhere to camp except with the loud drunks at the local lake. Please don't come here.

Not factual. There is a fair amount of prairie camping in Montana from BLM land, To the CMRNWR to the American Prairie reserve. I have slept out like a cowboy many nights- just me and the coyotes
I know North Dakota also has some nice National grasslands that have dispersed camping available- tho I have never been.

in fact, there is a new NFS unit in the Dakotas just for prairie

What this guy said. Had the chance to spend a summer out their and any of the hikes that are more than a mile from the main villages were not crowded it all. Dont get stuck around old faithful- it's cool and all but Northern Yellowstone is much more interesting imo.
Black Hills is very touristy
You could try the BWCA
Bob Marshall wilderness if you want to see at most a few other people while you're there. Prime grizzly country though so there's a non-zero chance you'll be eaten.
central idaho
one of the most remote places in the u.s.
Death Valley in the middle of July, Yosemite in the middle of January, Channel Islands in April, The Mexican Border at night
Oh my bad G, I thought you were asking how to die the fastest
#1 Alaska
#2 Montana
#3 Washington
#4 Tennessee Smokey Mtns.
#5 California
go downtown to fuckin memphis any time lol
Utah. Aside from the obvious national parks there, you should check out Escalante
Come to Wisconsin :DDDD boulder junction is very nice and lots of biking trail!!
going to visit as many states as I can
You're better off spending the entire time in California with a side trip to the Grand Canyon if you want to make the most of your time in America. California blows away the rest of the continent when it comes to natural beauty.
California blows away the rest of the continent when it comes to natural beauty.
CA has nice geography but lets not hyperbole get in the way of the facts. "blows away" is a bit of an overstatement. Lots of truly magnificent places on the continent
yes please stay in cali the rest of us prefer it lol
 from washington so i've spent my whole life in WA OR CA already
Go inna swamp. SE US along the gulf has some absolutely beautiful areas. No stunning mountain vistas, but its a serene beauty that doesnt exist anywhere else in the US.
The ugliest place in the entire country is Southern Colorado; anywhere else is pretty in one way or another.
What's wrong with Southern Colorado? Pic is the first image I found on google maps.
Unironically want to visit Southern Colorado now.
The beach at Galveston, Texas is nice and cruising the coast over to Corpus Christi was neat. Wish I had had more time to check out Sam Houston National Forest, the drive through the area made it seem promising.
The Salt Flats from West Wendover Utah to Salt Lake City were surreal and terrifying in a existenial kind of way but I do recommend it once. Lake Tahoe and the surrounding areas are a little touristy but the view is most of the fun. Hear there's nude beaches on the East coast of the lake but I've never been.
clearly you've never been to the west
i'm not sure if I have much time to go full on camping overnight, but I definitely want to drive through and hike around for a couple hours
i'll probably sleep in my car in parking lots and truckstops most nights
good suggestions, thanks
2574015 shut the fuck up retard, you wonder why the rest of the continent hates you
I don't think I'll go to alaska this time since I'd already be home by the time I get to washington, plus I don't want to bother driving through canada and passport and all that
ive lived in houston all my life south texas is fucking ugly and boring flat as fuck but if u head west into more east central texas around Brenham (about an hour drive) shit looks like the uk countryside super green fertile land with gentle rolling hills, Sam houston national forrest is a 44 min drive north of the city its really nice and kinda spooky
i've driven cross-country multiple times and hiked thousands of miles in the past 5 years and i can say without a doubt the most beautiful areas are not worth sharing with retards on a pipe fluting forum for LARPers
Anywhere good within a few hours drive of NYC? Planning a trip there this year if they drop the covid shit, don't want to stay in the city the whole time though.

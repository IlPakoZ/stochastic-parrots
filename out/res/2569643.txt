How does one protect themselves from rewilded animals in a country without guns?

Talking big animals aswell
Fight them with your fists and teeth like a man.
eh, idunno, they reintroduced wolves a couple years ago and farmers freaked out, beavers too i think.

How dangerous is that snake?
Liberal cuck detected. Maybe Reddit would be more your speed.
The aurochs is the ancestor of all cattle and thereby the most important animal in the history of mankind.
An exaggeration so great as to be ridiculous.
for a snake you just carve up a dead branch into a "rounders bat" but for the wolves and such they want to bring back i can only assume a bow and arrow for "bow fishing" or something
They've had rutting red stags for ever and I've never heard it to be a problem. Them Bulls will be scary as fuck.
yeah, after Huddersfield it's pretty clear bongland has an ongoing issue with "large snake" breeding
Pepper spray and knives
Oh wait, bongs can't carry those either lol
From a military perspective it should be the horse, but from an economic perspective it's not far off.
What about bees? Mosquitoes? Dogs? And I agree that I'd probably even put horses first. Cattle probably could have been supplanted for the most part by sheep, goats, and pigs.
Idris having a nice little holiday in and around Snowdonia?
Check out fandabi dozi on youtube. He’s from Scotland and he will tell you to make a good length walking stick. Legal everywhere, not considered a weapon, but you could use it as one if needed. If you could justify it for camping/fishing purposes, perhaps you could buy that Cold Steel knife with a hollow handle that fits on a stick. That way you could improvise a spear if need be. I don’t quite understand why everyone in the UK doesn’t take issue with the fact that self defense is a de facto crime.
We're cucked into thinking this is freedom
all of Europe is afflicted with the peasant mindset, but bongland has it Bad, at least in the states there is still an ongoing immune response, but even the "conservative" side of the brits still brags about how their bleeding rectum is proof the state loves them.
You can't.
In fact that's part of the plan of the rogue rewilders. They advise as experts to the media and claim silly stuff about them being indestructible and for people to stay away from them
heard a hog near Loch Arkaig, going back soon to kill it
Crossbow or spear
Go and chib it like a true Scotsman
self defense is a de facto crime
I have a lot of non-American friends, and while they often tout the advantages of their home countries (and they're strong ones, everyone knows the problems of finding financial security in the US), I still have a hard time getting past the idea that I can't own the tools necessary to protect my family in those places.
Maybe it comes from growing up in American cities, and in Europe or something the crime rate is so vanishingly low that it isn't a significant sacrifice for all of the other benefits that come from moving. But the Second Amendment is a hill I'd die on, and I'm no gun nut. I'm not even conservative.
in austria feminists resettle bears, wolf and lynx considering how densely populated austria is: the animals have no room, attack farm animals and humans. this is indeed cruelty to wild animals..
Why do mutts always do the "hur dur nogunz" dribble? Are they that stupid? Loads of Brits have guns. Just not small penis varieties like AR15s
in Europe or something the crime rate is so vanishingly low
Lmfao they wish
MY country has financial security!
son...
We don't have the same freedoms in law. We can't take it out on a hike, need good reason to have it in public, easiest way to get a licence is join a shooting club (stupid long wait lists) and multiple referees. Notwithstanding the fact it could be taken away any time
need good reason to have it in public
not true for shotguns
easiest way to get a licence is join a shooting club (stupid long wait lists) and multiple referees
not true for shotguns 
Notwithstanding the fact it could be taken away any time
true and fUCK the british police 
conclusion: if you are scared about non-venomous snakes then bring a shotgun with you on your walk, providing you have not pissed off the licencing team or live under a good police force
How many Euros get bankrupted by unexpected medical conditions, struggle to pay childcare costs, or scramble for tuition at universities? I'd bet not quite so many as there are Americans doing those exact things.
I'm not the OP, a rake or shovel would be best for a snake. A shotgun helps but won't stop a determined bear or bison unless dangerously close >>2569645, not to mention carrying a 40" shotgun won't be easiest
It's only 6 feet long. It's not going to chase you down and try to strangle you. And it's not venomous. Just just walk right by it.
protect themselves
This is the thought of someone who's lead a sheltered life. Animals aren't out to kill you. Animals aren't out to harm you. The woods, the wilds, the fields are safe.
WADDABOUT THAT ONE WOMAN WHO
I single anecdote isn't gonna kill you. Or put it another way - over 7 million people died of covid and many times that have long term effects from the infection. Yet you probably scream like a little baby when someone suggests you wear a mask. Yet you're trembling in fear from a few snakes?

october last a samurai sword gang terrorised the neighbourhood
wtf is going on in bongistan?
covid
cute bait
carrying a 40" shotgun won't be easiest
it depends really, picrelated could fit in a bag really easily. There is no need to defend yourself against the type of snakes we have in the UK. 
Wild boar arent that dangerous, you could certainly kill them with a knife, and the bison are currently under very careful observation and isolated to one area.
Knowing our nature, no weapons will be needed.
We have 0 threats in terms of animals, the worst that could happen is a wasp sting.
Wild boar arent that dangerous,
Yes they abso-fucking-lutely are; they're fast, tough, low to the ground and the males have a mouth full of knives. Even men who went out in a group SPECIFICALLY ARMED AND ARMORED FOR BOAR HUNTING would get killed from time to time because 200lb. of berserk armored pig with 6" tusks moving at 25mph is lethal in every sense of the word.
you could certainly kill them with a knife
If you also have catch dogs, maybe. But go ahead, I'd love to see you try.
have u ever seen the boar we have in england? 
They are tiny
all the big boar get taken the second they are seen. I have never seen a large boar living in england. I've been around plenty of boar here (and lots of them are half-breeds with domestic pigs) in the forest of dean and never been attacked by one. The most one has ever done in this country is bite off a womans finger.
How are laws over in the UK carrying that on a trail?
it has to be unloaded and you have to have your licence on you
Better if it's inside a gunslip or a bag but technically not law.
forgot to add:
although it is generally illegal to load it or discharge it in a public place, if you have a reasonable excuse such as defending yourself or dispatching a wounded animal then it is OK.
We invented dogs in order to protect ourselves and our life stock from wild beasts.
Just wait until I introduce taipans and tiger snakes into Israel.
Everyone saying cows aren't at least in the top 5 of most important animals is retarded and gay.
Horses obv most important. Them and cows shaped the aryan/yamnaya/Indo-European ancestors of us all that spread out and murderfucked the matriarchal natives of the old world. Stay mad you longhouse goys.
Needs protection from non venomous snake
 laughs in Australian
Ayyyeah get up there ya lil crocodile kunt here's a ciggie and a proper cold one get that up ya fine leathery bastard there ya go
We are not scared of non venemous snakes. We already have venemous adders and we are not afraid of them either because we aren't fags like you
largest snake? is that snake from Israel?
It's from my pants
It used to be before certain circumstances changed.
/k/ needs the illusion of danger in the woods
Don't fall for burger LARPs, the woods are safe
Stay still, face them, slowly back away, no flashlight or camera flashes

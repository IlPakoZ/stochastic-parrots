I've had the idea in my mind for many years to intentionally go homeless. This idea has come back into my mind recently and much stronger than before. The idea of packing a rucksack of some essentials, selling off all the added junk I have collected over the years and roam my country as I see fit.
What sorts of things should someone take with them, that would ideally fit into a hiking type of rucksack, that would be paramount for doing something like this? And also what preparations should one make for this? I.e, valuable skills etc.
You're really pushing these homeless threads hard over the last few weeks, aren't you?
I rarely lurk /out/ and even rarely post here. You go the wrong Anon, friend.
Met a few people that chose this life when I lived in Oregon. I get the "freedom" is appealing but just know what kind of lobster trap you're getting yourself into. 
(Assuming you're american) homelessness causes irreparable damage to your place in society. What's your end game? There's no packing up and just returning to "normal" life when it stops being fun. When you decide you want to clean up and settle down you'll find employment, rebuilding credit, securing housing, and healthcare to be immensely more difficult to set up. Not to mention how easy it is to slip into addiction and complacency, especially for those that feel "it'll never happen to me" or "I have more willpower than that."
Most of the people I knew are dead, the couple still alive are still on the street.
Just look into thru hiking lifestyle people that do pct or applachian trail are basically socially acceptable homeless community. Seems like a community full of basketcase normies and tards. There's a ton of funny stories of them dying to dumb shit because they all have this live laugh love type of viewpoint that ends up fucking them.
lurk more faggot, we get faggots just like you idly fantasizing about running away from home daily.
Your runnaway from home thread isn't different from any other, fuck off.
Daily
Erm. Not any more... Was worse 5 years ago. But again there probably was like ,6x the population here.
Legit just do it. Don't talk about it or plan anything.. have enough money to buy shit as you need it. And don't piss it away on shit you don't need.
Most truck stops showers are 13/14 bucks now day's. Carry some shitty flipflops for shower shoes.
It's never been easier to be homeless. Odd jobs will have you making $200 in a day doing just about anything. Homeless people can always get free food, so all that cash goes into your pocket. Simple as that. Inflation is fucking good for bottom feeders. If you don't pay rent, and you have other expenses like food subsidized then you will be able to do some simple odd jobs anywhere you go and be a "comfortable" hobo. Never been more comfy to be a hobo.
My advice is to simply start doing small overnights to get used to being homeless. Then do a weekend and work your way up to a week, then a month, etc. Let your experiences drive your chosen skillsets and gear.
buy a cheap gym membership for showers
It's another "I'm running away from home mom, and this time I mean it!" post.
mmmk...
Listen, it's fun and you'll like it and this website is full of literal honorless cowards so don't listen to anybody trying to discourage you
A vehicle will give you like 30 more degrees of temperature tolerance over what you would comfortably tolerate on foot.
Water is concern number 1. As for what else to bring, That's entirely based on what you intend to do, and what /out/ing has taught you that you will need.
For example, in about two weeks, I'm walking across the country. Pic related is what I'm taking with me (a few things are missing in the pic, namely mess kit, life straw, and fire kit).
For skills and preparations, you had better be used to hunger, being wet for several days, and have a plan for WHEN you lose everything to muggers. 
I suggest: 
splitting your kit into two parts: the main bag, and the belt kit. The belt will never leave you, and will have the bare minimum to live. The big bag makes living easy, but if you lost it for whatever reason, you could still keep yourself afloat.
Have an emergency fire method such as a road flare, because your flint and steel larping skills wont save you when its four degrees below zero, and you've just fallen in a stream.
Keep $50 in a wallet, but the rest of your cash elsewhere, so the mugger doesn't shoot you for giving him an empty wallet
Practice water fasting, meaning try to go a week without food, and only drinking water
Don't be fat
Don't be a mark. The homeless WILL know
Being able to run a mile with a 50lbs bag, without keeling over (otherwise you're ngmi).

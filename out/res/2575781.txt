Have you met any famous /out/ YouTubers IRL?
No, and i'd shoot them faster than i'd shoot a rabid brown bear about to eat my pregnant wife. I hate them so much.
I met Dan durston in Nelson, does that count?
I hate them too but I did meet Becca "Little Skittle" Bergstrom while on there CDT. Hard to hate someone so small and cute, with cute feet.
He has been doing some spots on other people's youtube channels but I wouldn't consider him a youtuber.
Something of an /out/ celebrity, but he earned it I think.
No idea who these people are, and I don't watch outdoor stuff on YouTube.
Glamor status posting 
You have fucked priorities and a pile of insecurities. Seek mastery, never popularity

only jewtuber I know is windigoon, but I knew him long before he got any subs. Nice to see he is doing well.
You're welcome. I still don't know which one is the eceleb in this picture, and I don't know any "famous" ecelebs.
I met Camping with Steve at a gas station.
Small world. I met Steve at my local landfill some months ago, a little before his wife passed. Not sure what he was doing there. Maybe trying to film a video? He had a rolled up carpet sticking out the back of his suv
I wouldn't worry about it.
Brutal heightmog

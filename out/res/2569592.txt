Hello all,
Would anyone know if the American Legion/AMvets etc has any travel related benefits like campgrounds/hookups/showers for those who are traveling around the states in a small camper?
Thanks,
Also a MAP so any other discounts etc.
just pay for it
Pay for what? I am considering just getting an annual membership.
/out/ isn't old enough to have any vets. It's mostly 16-20 year old zoomers that live with their parents and can't hold down a job.
There's a a few vets here, but we don't feel like we need handouts just to go /out
that's more of a Moose Lodge kind of thing
I was in the navy for 6 years and I will bend over backwards to avoid talking about my time in the service, letting people know I'm a veteran, and just avoiding other veterans in general.
I'd be embarrassed too.
Enlisted aircrew?
Speak for yourself. I get my fishing and hunting license for free and I have a pass for day use in my state parks. The one thing the army taught me is how to play the beauracracy. 
Now am I going to pay dues to join some vet organization for free campsites nah. But I'm gonna take my gibs. Sadly, gibs vary by state. I think there's a reduced rate national parks pass too, but it's sort of a pain and national forests are free.
Vets have free lifetime access to national parks now. In my state also state park, but most of my visits to state parks are to hunt and I use access that don't have no gates anyway so it's not much of a Benny. you can go apply for your national park pass right now vet anons.
NEETbros, >>2573970 also applies to anyone with a permanent disability.

You don't need free shit to go /out, you're just taking handouts. You're only slightly better than a welfare queen.
Every military base has lodging that you can use as a Veteran. There are also camping areas at most bases as well .Check out Military.com and search lodging or camping. I use them quite often . If you served, you earned this privilege.Use it.
These are earned benefits. Not free handouts.
I'm a full on welfare queen. And I would never deny it.

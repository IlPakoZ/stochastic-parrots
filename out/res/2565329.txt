aerating lawns
What the fuck is up with you burgers? Every week I find out some new weird thing you're doing
But anon, you're American.
I am an American who grew up and lives in the suburbs and even I find the lawn cult of America to be strange.
This. 
We have these things called yards, part of our property because many of us don’t live in commie blocks or shitty flats like Yurop.
Never seen anybody aerate the lawn in Florida though. I forgot about that since I left the Midwest. The grass down here is much different and the soil is super sandy
seconded
beetles?
My family emigrated to Montana way back, my great grandfather was born there, but I'm fully Norwegian
I guess it's just something for upper middle class people to spend their time and money on
We have gardens too, I don't live in a commieblock hellscape, I live in a small town where everyone has their own garden
I spent 3 years at my house maintaining a lush green lawn, and even set up a patch with shorter denser grass to be like a golf green. When i switched to native planting, i enjoyed my yard much better, and spending my time taking care of it was much more fun. Still kept most of the grass but let clover, dandelions, and wildflowers spread everywhere. Had so much wildlife for those couple years before selling. It was amazing.
tfw the starter doesn't say shit about aeration and you walk up to the first green looking like this
no worse feeling
My family emigrated to Montana way back, my great grandfather was born there, but I'm fully Norwegian

Just another day on nuout.
Had to know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall
I am 75% norwegian, 25% scottish, however my male lineage goes back to a boat that came to America in 1630, there were numerous scientific advancements thanks to my family that you benefit from on a daily basis, my parents are from oregon and michigan and I live in the south. I may not be fully norwegian, but I have been in America for 400 years and still retain a very very high amount of it for such a timespan.

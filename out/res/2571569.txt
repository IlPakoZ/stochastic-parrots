I am guessing that in context he is using some of that wood and snow to build a shelter, and the fire is just a short term source of warmth? Because fire, while nice to have for warming up quickly, raising morale, boiling water and cooking food, is not a substitute for a shelter.
If you havent cleared all the trees in a 200ft2 area around your site to keep your 24/7 bonfire alive are you even camping?
Why in gods name would I ever go to Alaska of all places?
Instead of freezing to death he burned himself alive after starting a major forest fire.
do you have any idea how fucking cold it is in alaska? you'd have to actively TRY to set the forest down, it wouldnt just happen by one big bonfire. cmon now.
Have you ever been outside?
Because screw it
one of the guys i ve worked for taught me to just set a good sized spruce tree on fire, it will keep you warm in a real emergency and give a great big smoke signal to anyone looking for you.
Yes, wildfires can happen in winter, on snow covered terrain. Global warming is contributing to the problem, and ash from the fires melts the snow. Without snow, the sun's rays aren't reflected and instead further warm the Earth. This feedback loop will continue until the Earth becomes too hot to sustain any life. So, thank you science deniers for killing everyone. I hope you're proud of yourselves.
This is low quality bait.
Except it's not bait. The Earth's atmosphere has warmed by 2 degrees C in the last 50 years because we use petroleum powered vehicles. Which country is the largest consumer of petroleum fuel? Which country drives around huge pickup trucks? Which country voted for trump six years ago?
Alright nigger unless you wanna hop back on Reddit and bring some actual points on global warming instead your thin veil of America and trump hate I’d shut the fuck up. Yes global warming is a thing but if everyone stopped driving their car all at once that wouldn’t even make a dent of change in comparison to actual killing the corporations that feed you these retarded ideas that it’s the consumers driving the cars fault and not those pumping more green house gases into the air than zyklon B into your morning shower
Why don't you go vandalize some paintings or something to bring attention to your whiny ass?
Would it help if I drove a battery powered truck that weighs three times as much and requires invasive mining for the components, and burning fossil fuels to generate the power to charge the battery. Also, sorry next time I will vote for the establishment to fund endless war, because that is really good for the environment.
stopped reading right there, nice try kike.

I am 26 and I have been suffering with mental health and insomnia for a few years.
My.plan is to fill a good hikimg pack with a tent, sleeping bag, all the essentials that would fit in a 55 litre bag and just book a flight to Europe (Im from UK) I am in reasonable shape but have no camping or wildlife expetience, I will maimly be travelling through Eurppe maimlu near cities but sometimes wild camping and just going until I find some form of meaning or experience as much of Europe as I want. I will be staying at hostels as well and I have a few grand for hostels and city experiences etc.
How do you see this going for me and any advice?
expetience, I will maimly be travelling through Eurppe maimlu
If you're already flying to another country why don't you go to one with actual hiking trails?
I plan on travelling through Europe, getting trains and buses and occasionally staying in cities for a few days and staying in hostels occasipnally etc
my bad, been awake for the last 30 hours
So you're just going to be a homeless city faggot? That has nothing to do with the outdoors.
No outside the cities, I dont want to be eaten by fucking bears I live in the UK fuck sake
Also what are some essentials to buy
Firstly cross the channel to calais and get robbed, that might just be enough evropa for you.
Good way to fuck tourists, go for gold.
You'll be dead inside of a month. Sorry. I hope its painless.
how do you see it going for me?
Very poorly if you don’t have a more concrete plan. 
I’m not sure if “backpacking across Europe” is still a thing, but it was extremely popular in the 80’s and 90’s (I think crime may have changed it). Anyway, during that time there was a differentiation between backpacking in Europe (exactly as you described it) and backpacking in the US (which is strictly camping and hiking). 
There are options in the US that are very safe (from both bears and Americans). The Appalachian Trail is the obvious choice. It’s well established, so the logistics are very easy to work out, and there’s support along the route in the form of hostels, easy resupply options, and guidebooks. I’m not sure how expensive an international flight is; I’d guess maybe $500. Then it’s very roughly $1,200 a month to hike the AT (that’s how much most people spend; it could probably be a lot cheaper). 
Europe has the Camino de Santiago, which again has support along the way. And it’s also an established path, so the planning is easier. I think it’s mostly hostels, and definetly worth looking into.
I can’t stress the planning enough. If you try to wing it with zero experience, you’ll end up having a shitty time then going home where it’s familiar and comfortable.
Fuck it, I'll bite. If you can make it to Malaga, Spain on the 15th of May, I'll hike with you to the strait of Gibraltar. Provided you have some hiking experience and can hack 9 consecutive 25km days without complaining. We'll be camping illegally most nights.
Here's my Lighterpack for inspiration:

If you haven't bought anything and have money to spare, I'd suggest replacing the big three (pack/shelter/sleep system) with some lighter options.
Try "wild camping" in scottland first before going abroad. Cape Wrath Trail. You will benefit from the expetience.
If the money is enough to fill up supplies then you are good. If not, then you will need to do some jobs. Look up Forestanon on Youtube. He had a similar story. Depression, etc. Going outside and living a bit in the wild is the best thing to do, but don't waste it on hotels. Find yourself an area that is remote. I recommand the Parc régional du Mercantour in southern France. Low population density. You will need to be alone for some time, but bring a radio with you to listen to comfy classical radio stations. Debussy, Bach, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovski heals the soul. You are one the right path, anon. I just came home from a 1 week trip to my cabin in Lorraine in northeast France, it was great, I feel better now.
Also, you need a steady place to stay like a canvas tent in a remote valley with a portable wood stove to feel at home. Wood stove+tent will cost you about 600€, maybe less if you buy used stuff. Don't go for some expensive lightweight homosexual nylon tent that you need to pack up every morning in a city park. Buy yourself a frame bagpack and haul your shelter to the place you whish to stay and go back to a city to buy food and supplies.
why do you need a tent and sleeping bag if you're staying at hostels? also isn't camping illegal in europe?
Op is doomed lol.
This is where headlines like "man mollested by a racoon" come from.
For me its stroude, many survivals overdo or underdo things to unreasonable lengths and heights. they start to build tends and homes in areas you can chill on the ground with nothing at all, or build nothing where it is necessary.
I wonder how humanity survived being that unopportunistic.
i just want to say if you are not mesner, a tibetian monk or an Inuit you don't survive day on ends in an ted with nothing at all.
Europe's a shithole, go to Sweden or Norway if you're a brit
Bug spray depending how long you're out
Mental health is more of a choice than it isn't. If you are in europe you don't even need a tent. Just a good sleeping bag and shoes that will keep you from stepping on a needle (Spain+France taught me that) 
The usual reccomdations are Vagrant Holiday and Bald and Bankrupt on youtube if you've not done that rabbit hole already do that for a relatively okay idea of what you put up with. Don't expect anything to be comfy and beware of winter. 
All you really need is the ability to sleep warm, eat every so often and stay clean. The rest is just moving around aimlessly day to day. Statistically you'll have to defend your stuff or stash it eventually. The longer you do this the more repairs become needed. Carry way more socks than you think you will need. Unless you think you need 7 pairs. That's too much. 
The sad things is the stuff that will help you be good at stuff while hobo mode is the same stuff that helps keep you from needing to BE a hobo in the first place. IE work ethic, never ever having to ask parants for free shit, not being a carless person (There are people who think driving is not a right) Long story short, if you waited till now to do this and haven't got any experience having mental health issues will fuck you up faster than any bad preperations ever will because your mind is the first and best tool you need to work out the issues that you will face. If you can't do that now, don't put yourself into an environment with even less control and with a bunch of useless stuff on so you can move around aimlessly while fearing for your next place to sleep until lack of comfort and fear overwhelm your sense of fun.

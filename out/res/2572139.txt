Good week for mushrooms ahead edition
Mushroomobserver.org
The Bolete Filter: https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/
Inaturalist app (directly draws data from mushroomobserver but is itself a more generalized platform)
Google Scholar: Massive resource for papers and studies regarding current clinical and indigenous uses of medicinal fungi.
If you expect to get a remotely meaningful ID here, you need to be taking photos of the mushroom as you found it, on it's substrate, a clear shot of the top and side view of it, and a clear shot of the gills/pores/stipe/stem or otherwise the entire undercarriage of the mushroom. every detail of the encounter helps, where, when, what was the weather, etc.
If you want people who do this for a living to give their guess on ID's, take all of the above and make quality observations on Mushroomobserver.
This science needs as much redundant ID and loacation data as possible, any observation has value and is a meaningful contribution that takes a few more seconds than just taking a picture of the pretty thing you saw in the woods.
Can anyone help me id this guy? He grew up in my neighbours yard.
Im in argentina
These are edible fungus in the forests of Argentina, it's round but it's not Cyttaria. It could be budding puffball mushrooms, which tend to grow in clusters. You can do a spore print, seeing the shape and color, will go a long way in identifying the species.
The broad, flat edible mushrooms, like chicken of the woods, are good for grilling or even deep frying like chicken as a source of protein. Can steam them and put them in soups and stews like cream of mushroom as well, it's a good source of protein in a survival context along with fish and game.
i would definitely try to spore print, but the guy doesnt seem to have gills. maybe it's too young yet. if it ever develops them ill try it
on another note, i also found this around my neighbourhood. after consulting a local mushroom guidebook im thinking its pleurotus albidus.
Aight, I got my red wine cap sawdust spawn and a n outdoor bed of mulch/straw. The instructions say to make layers, but can I just mix it all up together? Also, after I do that, should I not disturb it (but keep it slightly damp)?
I think it's a puffball of some kind. Those are typically edible if the flesh is white inside, but dont eat it if it's yellow at all.
...I never say this out loud but I absolutely think of mushroom patches as spawn locations. EQ and wow have forever ruined my herbalism internal monolog.
Hiya there my FUNGUYS!
It's been raining here in the northern midwest, and I just found these lil' guys yesterday...
I was wondering, since I have a chunk of mycelial mass I cut off to soak 'em, if it would be possible to "Inoculate" another place with it, provided I follow the 'Shroom "Feng shui" guidelines like:
I've spored giant puffballs before,(molasses and distilled water--but that was spores,) and wondered if it was possible.
Gonna go look again...
The rain has been EXACTLY right for these lil' fellas.
what do?
Fly Agarics?
Enjoy your trip...
HYDRATE.
(I know you're LYING)
Just went out to look at the place I found the first 2... Nothing.
Even thogh it was drizzling.
Prolly too cold.
fungus among us. bastard was huge and almost as big as my pack
nice thats a reishi!
I hate mushrooms so much. 
I am literally repulsed by them.
I can't stop locking this. How horribly am I gonna die bros?
licking
i inoculated about 100 big logs to make shiitake mushroom 2 years ago . no mushroom yet... i think i did everything right. i can see the mycelium propagates around the holes and i can see some too on the top of the log so that look ok at that level, but some logs are starting to grow competitive mushrooms like turkeytail. shid. hope it won't be a total loss. maybe a little bit later this spring something will happen. I'll keep dunknig a few logs in water to force em, see what happens.
and you say you had results? i tried that 2 times on various terrains and it never worked. i even tried with just the spores. also burried the mushroom after i harvested all its spore , in case something may spring out of it. nada. tried all that within , idk, the last 6 years. havent seen one. and to contrast this , i always know where to find one in the wood: it always grow at the same place year after year. maybe there is a symbiosis with the shrub and the quality of the soil may have something to do with it. idk.
i dont even really like the taste. sort of like egg. i guess with proper spices or sauce it's just bland food that can become whatever you want... 
too bad the spot i know is possibly contaminated. next to a sawmill that use heavy equipment... strangely "arrid" looking compared to all the woods surrounding it, like the bush and tall grass that managed to grow now, sparsely, took 5 times longer than it should be.
New England reporting in. First sighting of the season yesterday for me. Last spring was really dry and the first year I started hunting, so looking forward to this spring which has been very wet.
How do I find a fucking morel? I've been foraging for years and consider myself almost an expert. I've eaten probably over 100 species of plants, not many mushrooms but I've had plenty of oysters, puffballs, chickens, but never a morel. I've been doing everything right. Over the weekend we got a crazy 6 inches of rain. I went to this place I thought would be perfect, old farmstead, apple trees, oaks, tulip poplar. Looked for hours. Not one morel. Wtf am I doing wrong?

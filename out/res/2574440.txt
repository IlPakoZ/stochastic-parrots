It's fun to have one every once in a while, but way less practical for camping since portable stoves and gas is especially cheap. Excluding winter where it's a necessity for survival and a small percentage of people actually go /out/, what tangible benefits besides being a natural bug repellant and wildlife deterrent does it offer? Your gear and knowledge of the land should be suited to deal with both of those with proper planning. Go to sleep when the night starts getting cold and you'll wake up around sunrise.
Ita comfy, that alone is enough to have me make a fire.
Portable stoves and gas have yet to be cheaper than a bic lighter.
There's nothing "practical" about camping in of itself. It's all a big larp so you can get into better touch with nature. Camp fires are nearly as old as man itself and if you don't feel a natural draw to them and want to have them for their own sake, you're probably a subhuman who should stay on your couch eating microwaved frozen dinners. There's nothing more efficient than TV dinners my friend.
Calling something a larp implies that it's bad. Getting in touch with nature using a method older than written history isn't bad.
It just doesn't feel right without one
Maybe larp was the wrong word to use, but the point is that looking for practical/modern ways of cooking when you're engaging in an activity meant to escape modernity is self-defeating. Anyone who is objects to camp fires while camping is one of the following:
too lazy to gather and process firewood
too weak to gather and process firewood
completely out of touch with the natural world and his own ancestral origins.
No it doesn't you fucking sperg
Agreed
Agree to a point. I'm definitely in the lazy category these days. Between weather being hot, fire bans, and longer hiking distances I'm interested more in relaxing then sleeping over tending a fire on many trips. Plus I'm not one for complex meals over the fire.
stink of smoke the whole trip
I'll pass
Doesn't like the smell of campfire smoke
You don't even go /out/, so not surprised.
I'm sure you prefer the scent of your boyfriend's cologne
i agree with this, it smells nice when the fire is roaring, but two weeks later when your bag still smells its a bit much
what tangible benefits besides being a natural bug repellant and wildlife deterrent does it offer?
It's an excuse to get the kids to stop running around screaming like savages. "Hey guys, come sit down around the fire so you don't trip and fall and get burned."
I don't say this but fpbp
I can make a fire completely with local materials, no modern gear or equipment needed. It will cook meat and other foods, boil water, and will provide charcoal for purifying water, as well as warmth for the cold.
If you can start a fire just by rubbing sticks, it's extremely useful for survival. Or just carrying flint/lighter to spark a flame, saves space and money. Just requires a bit of work, and I personally enjoy the whole ritual of building a fire.
I think LARP implies it's not authentic and it's just fake or pretending, while camping is just camping. It's like saying jogging is a LARP, it makes no sense.
LARP is Live Action Role Play which is basically DnD played by nerds in the woods with foam swords and magic spells it's pretty funny but also harmless. It's nerdier than actual DnD which is a popular Hollywood thing now.
This is LARP
This is some real old internet memes

This always make me crack up
LIGHTNING BOLT
LIGHTNING BOLT
SLEEP
that doesnt make any sense, what holds that floating cone of dirt in place
These
Who cares? Are you using it for something other than camping?
If you can start a fire just by rubbing sticks, it's extremely useful for survival.
No it isn't. You don't need fire for survival when it's even possible to make it by friction with things you find around. Any idiot can do that when it's warm, dry and cozy. You need fire for survival when you're lost in a dark woods and get hit by a blizzard and the only thing that's keeping you concious is a fuckload of adrenaline.
no it isn't, except for when it is
I really hate cooking over them, ngl. Cant stand the smoke, that shit kills me.
Dont like trying to dry stuff over them.
Lotta work for a larp.
But, fuck anybody who wants to tell me I cant have one when I want one.
But it isn't. My point is that, when you'd need it, you fucking can't do it no matter how high-lvl pyromancer you think you are. From practical point of view, only reason i'd actually consider it important to know these kinds of "alternative" fire starting methods is that it makes you respect modern fire starters more and forget those silly power fantasies about rubbing sticks together and "surviving" like a caveman.
Anyone who isn't naturally drawn to a campfire doesn't have a soul.
As for practicality, its easier to carry a lighter and some waterproof matches than half a gallon of propane when you're on a several week long hike. Of course, if your complaint is that it isn't necessary for survival, you're quite right. Neither is a tent. Neither is a hot meal. Hell, if its just a weekend outing, you really don't NEED to eat. Just bring a water bottle, wear a t-shirt and jeans, and just start walking. 
Now, stop being gay, and go build a fire for you and your friends to sit and talk around, you soulless golem.
this guy gets it

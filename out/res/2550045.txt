so how do you get into urbex?
you walk into abandoned places
any types of locations i should start with?
abandoned places near you
what the fuck is wrong with zoomers man, rub two of your brain cells together for a second and think of how retarded the question you're asking is. there's nothing difficult or spiritual or mental about urban exploration, you just walk around. no one's going to shoot you on sight unless you walk into a drug den, or nigger. the worst thing that happens in most cases is security or police show up and ask you to leave
just walk in to abandoned places surrounded by security dude
retard. also i was asking what type of places to start with, not how to fucking explore
abandoned
security
if it's abandoned there isn't security, and they won't do shit except ask you to leave. start with exploring a coffin, how fucking stupid do you have to be to ask "where do i go to look at stuff?"
if it's abandoned there isn't security, and they won't do shit except ask you to leave.
you just said abandoned buildings don't have security and then proceeded to say they do. come up with better bait next time
zoomers
two brain cells
Well there's the problem right there, anon
^Ignore this faggot
First of all, get boots that don´t get pierced by nails and glass. Extremely important.
Then, get an asbestos mask. This may sound overkill, but if you explore some half rotting, half collapsed building that hasn´t been touched in years, you´re gonna create a lot of dust, and things may shift, causing asbestos to be set free.
It doesn´t take a lot of asbestos to fuck you up. I´m not saying get a full-on gas mask, but get a 3M classified for asbestos. Shouldn´t be more than 20 bucks.
Then, the biggest factor on how much fun you´re gonna have, is where you live. If you live in a shithole, there´s a good chance you can see 10 abandonned buildings just by looking outside of your window.
If you live in a 1st world country, you´ll probably have to find a community.
There´s also Google-Maps community maps, with thousands of locations, but you gotta have connections for people to give you permission to view those, because in 1st world countries, the urbex folks are all paranoid, because of vandalism and subhuman graffitti niggers.
I used to be on facebook communities, but barely anyone uses facebook anymore, so I don´t know how it´s done now.
You also might wanna have wellies, and in really shady structures a hard-hat.
Also, tell people close to you where you´re going.
IF you live in Germany, I can give you a couple of locations.
thanks for the advice anon. i do have have decent boots, just no gas mask. i'm not in germany though i'm in canada. i looked online to see if i could find any local urbex groups but didn't find much.
Other anon, I guess you're talking about that urbex elite photo Databank. Do you have any cool locations in brandenburg? Been going to lots of military bases and want to go to Kaserne kummersdorf next but there seems to be a lot of activity around there. Do you know anything as big as the one in Luckenwalde but with just as lax security?
To the West-South-West of Brandeburg, there´s some kind of Halbinsel, and there seem to be 6 different spots just there.
I´ll just send you the Maps-Image, because they are so close together, that you should be able to find them. I don´t know if they´re all still active though, some of them aren´t updated regularly.
The place is called Kirchmöser, but I guess if you live near Brandeburg, you may know it already.
No idea about the quality of those places either. With those maps, you never really know.

Here's the database, in case any euro anons are interested
euros
FUCK!
do you also have some interesting Locations in Northrine Westphalia or close to NRW?
every city has storm drains. every industrial area has abandoned buildings. look at infiltration.org for inspiration, they're from toronto
If you live in a deindustrialized shithole like I do, a good way to start finding places is to use Google maps satellite view and look along railroads. The website abandonedrails.com is a great respurce for US railroad locations. Within approximately 15 min of looking around the outskirts of any medium sized city I can find one. Once you think that youve found a place, try to see it in person before you dive in. Holes in fences, boards on windows, old graffiti, lack of vehicles, and overgrown vegetation are good signs that a place is thoroughly abandonded. Picrel is from a town that I've never been to and randomly chose (Erie Pennsylvania) which I found in about 10 minutes. IMO the best way to stay safe is to take a trusted friend with you. GL and have fun out there
there's a steel factory near Krefeld or düsseldorf I went to in 2010. plenty of scaling or climbing activity. However I think they added a movie theater inside the old factory. Still worth a visit.
Imma give you some advice, choch. You can leave the board at any time. No one will miss you.
Great, thanks for this.
Can I save this in Google maps?
Ever had any issues with homeless people squatting?
Fairly often you'll sew signs of squatters like mattresses and litter in abandonded industrial areas, but running into people is exceptionally rare. It's only happened to me twice. Once saw a guy just watching us from a window, a very old man whoshouted at us to go away while we were in a parking lot looking for a way to get inside. We just turned around and left without any issue. The last thing that the types of people who live in abonded buildings want is to be seen and kicked out, so they really just try to avoid everyone. You're probably more likely to get assaulted by a crack addict in a gas station parking lot than inside some old factory.
Start looking around for abandoned places when you are out and about, theres probably more than you think. For me, especially old factories were easy to find. Be aware that a lot of places have been trashed by young people/homeless. A lot of glass on the floor, i would always go wearing a thick soled shoe. Also drug needles. Thick padded running shoes and clothing makes you look more like a guy that took a wrong turn or just "got curious" and had a look in the building while out running rather than someone dangerous. You want to be mindful of safety, bring flashlight and phone to call for help, be careful what you step on as wooden floors can be rotten through or stairs can collapse. Be aware of your enviroment. But usually its okay. Ive never met any, but theres been homeless people sleeping at most of the ones ive seen at some point so far, its a decent sign in some ways because then the place is truly abandoned, you´d want to make sure that there isnt anyone comming to check on the building. The asbestos advice from the other anon is probably a good idea.
I enjoy urbex (especially abandoned malls) and have followed various related YouTube channels for years, and you know what I've noticed? Unless it's an amusement park, urbex happens inside of a building--literally indoors--in 99% of cases. Why the fuck are you posting about it on /out/doors? Do city idiots think that any venue not in a cubicle, apartment, or restaurant counts as "outside"?
Where in Canada?
No, the complexes I go to require me to walk there since I have no car and are very big and make me walk around a lot. I spend more time going from building to building than actually inside them. 
https://mega.nz/folder/d0cHEAha#PcfPeU7PGkZ9Yazc08GlIA
Link related it's one of the places I was at where I was constantly outside going on a hike. 
Also I'd like to argue that this thread has more of a reason to exist than yet another gearthread where the people posting in them don't even go outside
Just make sure that you have good boots and wear gloves. The last thing you want is to get tetanus by cutting yourself on a piece of rusty metal.
that filename
I'm going to bump the thread just because you're being a nonce.
Sweet place, went there today was is very good condition I can only recommend the town. I also met an old couple that used to work at the place and they told me a bit about the town.
Here's the pics
https://mega.nz/folder/11Eg1Qjb#KzWPzn4YK8UPO2396ZwY_g
Do you guys think megar folders are a good way of sharing trips or pics? 
It's just easier for me as there is no file limit and I don't have to upload them all
old buildings near roads that connect two cities
OP, you are an insufferable retard.
This. I got in on a Facebook group that did paid trips. A girl roped me into it. From there I was able to meet people and stop paying. That shit is gay. They'd organize shit to justify the cost but I never wanted that in the first place. 
Do the mask. Be paranoid about danger. I had a friend fall through a factory floor that looked good, but it wasn't. He fucked up his leg and we had to drag him out of there. Be careful. This shit is as dangerous if not more than exploring abandoned mines if you act stupid.
Now pls KYS autistic faggot
Based. They're mad but they needed to hear this.
honest to god, people gatekeep so fucking hard it's stupid as fuck. 
The sentiment is to keep people from destroying beautiful abandoned places, which is understandable, but it's still fucking stupid.
From what I've heard:
- post proof of any expeditions you go on to give yourself credibility and ask around
- use google for your location
- use google maps and follow rivers/train tracks
- use wikimapia
- join random urbex discords from tiktok urbexers and ask around
- DON'T FUCKING DESTROY THE PLACES
best of luck to you
The best places I've found, I just pay attention while I drive around and look for ladders, anywhere there's graffiti (means there's a way up), and yeah just peel your eyes and look around sometimes it's just obvious.
Ignore the gatekeeping seethe virgins, this is a hobby that should be spread, just not to autistic middle school edgelords.
dude fuck off
it's hard to get into this especially if you don't know where to look or don't know what's abandoned. quit seething
Thank you for the solid advice! I think I'll go get myself these things now I didn't realize I should get them. genuine :)
Nice! Where is this?
GOD DAMN is this german?????
Did you go there because of my recommendation, or was it just a coincidence?
Nice pictures btw.
I wonder what´s up with that boat...
And I totally would have stolen that Polizeiautotüre.
It's an old industry town called kirchmöser, it's also discussed previously in the thread
I'm this anon >>2550723 so I looked into it after you send the location. I wasn't convinced at first but after I looked at it from street view it looked pretty dope. Thanks for the recommendation.
If you got any more I'd be happy to look into this as well. But I'm probably not going to go there within the next two weeks.
Well there was a trash yard with a bunch of cars close by so I think they just used it to store their boat.
I also would have liked to take that door but I'm on foot. The place also looked like there were gypsies living there so I just didn't enter cuz I don't want any trouble with them.
Shit sorry that actually near Luckenwalde. It's called Adolf Hitler Lager or 3. Lager it's to the south of the town. Just put on Google Street view and the place with a bunch of blue is where it's at
How can I find new places to explore? My friends aren't interested in urbex and I generally don't like meeting new people. Are there any good sites or forums for abandoned places?
Does anyone know if there is a way to search Google Maps for places marked "permanently closed"? This would be a really good way to find locations.
Satellite maps. Check newspapers for closed businesses and the like. Pick up on patterns: where places typically get abandoned where you live.
shit man, as an eurofag who wants to get into urbex this really is a gold mine
thank you anon
Thanks man. 
So many places in Belgium getting demolished lately so it's been a pain keeping track.
This one has a few as well although it's getting less reliable with the updates.
https://www.urbex.nl/locations-by-category/
I've been to a few that were closed or gone completely so better get moving if you wanna see 'em.
I'd be keen to meet up with similarly minded folks in Europe to go exploring.
I know a few spots around my town that are worth checking out but only if you're in the area.
picrel - Sanitorium Du Basil in Wallonia
The state of 15yr old /out faggots
Not sure why it's flipped but here's the whole facade in case anyone's interested.
all those places are trash
KYS faggot you´re trash.
what the fuck is wrong with zoomers man, rub two of your brain cells together for a second and think of how retarded the question you're asking is. there's nothing difficult or spiritual or mental about urban exploration, you just walk around
I'd be keen to meet up with similarly minded folks in Europe to go exploring.
thanks for the resources mate. I'd like to meet people to go urbex too, but unfortunately I'm stuck wagecucking in Italy. I usually go on the weekends if I have enough free time. If this thread is still up I'll give updates if I visit any of the linked locations
I travel around and do this around the world 
https://gopro.com/v/572zN9bVovWXz
Pisa has a cool factory just watch out I met a homeless guy
This guy is correct you have to just go out and look you can spot pretty easy if s place is abandoned and every building I've been hasn't had security that's mostly big places you see on the internet that's why people gatekeep locations so retards don't ruin it for the rest of us
I like setting up creepy scenes in these places
If you don't like it then stop posting.
seethe
This is cool. Like found art experience/sculpture. Would love to find this and light the candles. More?
I had a dream last night i was trapped in an abandoned school I was exploring with friends and a tornado came and lifted up the building and everyone died except for me. Then I woke up and got a tornado alert on my phone. I felt like Michael Shannon but we didn't get jack shit anyway
Abandoned car dealership today
how do you get into urbex?
You don't . Stay on the interwebz and leave the /out/doors for the rest of us
I'm getting The Long Dark vibes with that scene
I wish I had a lockpick yhe prices eurotard pay fr Levi's I would loot this In a heartbeat
any location you can find info online sucks or doesn't exist anymore.
people either ransack those spots or the owners shut it down because of the traffic.
learn to find your own spots or meet someone local who will show you shit. learn your area's history. that's a good starting point for finding out what kinds of places might exist abandoned and be worth checking out. google earth is pretty nifty too.
Nestolgic booba
This guy has a point
damn they weren't lying, those shits are pointy
Unfortunately someone did light the candles and started a fire
Belgian anon here, I'd be interested in meeting up with you if you don't live too far. I live near Antwerp in Flanders.
So many places in Belgium getting demolished lately
Real, recently visited that famous HFB factory in Liege again and those demolition faggots are making progress.
Danke :)
Is there anything like this for US locations?
Everywhere the crackheads also go when they do heavy tweaking. Urbex is composed of crackheads, taggers, and hikers with mental illness.
retard
And with few exceptions abandoned structures, at least the ones that do get popular are going to be demolished within a few years especially as more urbexfags catch on about them. I understand the mentality of not outright destroying anything but the obsession with leaving everything exactly as it is is wishful thinking when you tend to know this place won't exist for long. Though there are certainly places that demolition is highly unlikely to happen to. What gets me more is when a place is already graffitiid and vandalized in numerous ways but people are still like 'be extra careful'.

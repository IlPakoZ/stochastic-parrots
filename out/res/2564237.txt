What does /out/ think about mountain huts?
I had one of the best evenings I've ever had up at Madison Spring Hut. Amazing spot, and comfy bunks
A helluva lot nicer than a tent after skinning up slopes all day.
Where is that? I wouldn't really call it a hut ...
That ain't no hut. That's some /in/door larper's estate.
Not sure what exactly you mean by 'mountain hut' here, but when I was 10 my dad bought a sizable tract of land deep in the Appalachian mountains here in Tennessee, from the base of the mountains it takes 2 and a half hours of winding dirt roads crossing river streams to get to the land. We built an off-grid cabin up there with my grandpa and other family members soon after with a woodstove, couple of bedrooms and bunk rooms, and a full wrap around porch. It is now a hunting cabin for us and a place to retreat whenever we feel like it. Pic is of a gorge carved by a mountain stream below the cabin.
They destroy the outdoors. If it were up to me I would prohibit the building and maintenance of huts, roads, trails, and other infrastructure above 2100m in the Alps.
I think they're good. I'll be doing an alpine crossing this summer and I'll be spending the nights in those instead of a tent
that's fuckin rad
Until he finds people have vandalized it while he's gone.
hut
that's not the backwoods Tennessee code anon
As far as we can tell no one has laid a finger on it in all the years it has been there. We take precautions, though.

That ain't no hut
It is

Is that supposed to be a hut? I don't understand what you're asking.
Is that supposed to be a hut?
Yes
It's not a hut
We don't have them here, too much land and not enough people
They look pretty, but aren't they basically just a hostel in the mountains? I don't even like setting my tent up on the same lake as another person, I can't imagine enjoying spending hours hiking and then getting stuck in a small room with 5 other guys.
More of a chalet
I should utilize them more, there are 950 public huts in NZ and there's always sweaty hiker girls in them.
There's some way back ones that might get used once in a few years too.
This is /out/ where you're a total larper if you don't sleep on the ground at least 25 miles away from where you parked
Not too far off, ironically. It was built by the berlin alpine association in the late 19th century. Since it was considered representative for berlin and germany, it is quite luxurious for that. The patrons definitely do go out though, since there's basically nothing else to do in the area and the road is not open for general traffic.
German-speaking alpinists call any simple sleeping place in the mountains a hut (because they usually are an actual hut). Some include restaurants or hotels, most don't. They have certain ways of doing things that differ from normal hotels, because usually they cannot be accessed with a car (many have simple lifts though). This hut happens to have a hundred beds, but it's still a hut.

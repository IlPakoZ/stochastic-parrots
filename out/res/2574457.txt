Never make another knife thread again
Why would you need anything else?
I just got this, what am I in for?
WTF is wrong with the handle--send it back my dude they didn't finish making that thing.
You're in for the big sad.
blisters, you are in for blisters
I'd like to stick my penis in her vagina if you know what I mean
I don’t follow. Hint?
huh? How does that even work?
Nice knoifs Richie Rich.
That’s far from overpriced collector shit
Master race checking in
Your flaws are forgiven
No, I can't say I do.

Esee 4. Does everything I need a knife to do.
I like this knife and I never see it get mentioned anywhere
She looks like an ex I wish I had, if you know what I mean
If it cut, it's a good knife.

ive had a 6 for years, kinda wish i bought one of the smaller ones, its just too long, without being long enough to fit the machete niche 
its pretty good for things like rabbits, but god awfull for perch
Condor is my jam and I won't apologize
I think 4 inches isn't that bad of a length but I do agree that it might be too thick and unwieldy for skinning. 
What I don't like is when people pull out their huge ass 7 inch 'knife' as if they're larping as Rambo or something.
The Buck 119 and KA-Bar US Army are iconic, well made, and much to large to be practical for most people.
I have no justification to buy this but it's still fucking awesome.
i just ogtta say, i really fucking love the handle, just fits my had so well its unreal, been thinking of getting a 3 or a Izula II and a 5 just for for keks
scandi grind > anything else
I wish I could see a side by side with that thing and an Izula. I might consider spending the money with how much I use the little fixed blades
who's the broad?

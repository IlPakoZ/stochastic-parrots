I am going on a several hundred mile trip soon. I’m preparation I have been going barefoot as much as possible to toughen the soles of my feet. I already know to change socks often and to put bandaids over blisters/hotspots etc etc. I have only been on shorter trips, so while I realize taking care of my feet is vitally important, I don’t have experience in doing it long term, just the basics of changing socks and using blister bandaids, and that’s about it.
What should I carry in my first aid kit to keep my feet in good condition? I see a million different foot powders and tinctures and creams, I know nothing about these things so I am unsure what to get.
For reference I will be in a hot and humid environment.
It's kind of nuts to think about how far we have fallen as a species. People used to trek hundreds of miles wearing sandals or barefoot.
Agreed
You want moleskin for blisters. What you do is cut out a ring that goes around (not over) your blister. Gives it a nice cushion and lets you keep going.
Fuck that shit torture your feet and go hobbit mode.
people also used to live to 30
what’s your point
Thanks for the advice, I had never heard that before
any other tips anyone?
I find that moleskin and bandages tend to fall off a lot, so if you take athletic tape, that stuff they use to stabilize joints, then wrap the bandage with it they can stay on for days at a time without issue. Also, if you start to feel rubbing, stop immediately and bandage it or it just gets worse. There’s also these things called glacier gel bandages so if you do get a bad one that helps keep the blister from drying out and hurting. They’re a godsend.
I have heard benzoin helps with tape falling off? Is it any good?
athletic tape
If you put liquid bandage on the sticky side of the moleskin it sticks a LOT better
Possible. Just my method. I ended up hiking 5 days in a row with my feet wrapped like that and never had a problem.
If it works, it works!
Adult life expectancy hasn't changed that much in a thousand years. Infant mortality rates are what has drastically improved.
Moleskin is absolute dog crap now. Get a roll of luekotape off of amazon, the real stuff made in russia. Its dirt cheap snd has many many uses. The only tape ive found that actually stays in place.
Just a word of caution, use it before a blister forms. If you put it over an already raw spot, leave it on till you can soak your foot in warm water. Other wise it will rip the skin off of a blister and then youre fucked. It sticks very very well
plain old bandaids
Anyone saying this has never had a blister, never hiked with someone who had a blister, and has never even bothered to look up how to treat blisters when hiking. 
Going barefoot might help, maybe. How your feet rub against the inside of a shoe isn’t the same as how they rub against the ground when barefoot. The traditional course is to hike more.
Yes, they did it on a regular basis and built up extremely thick calluses when following animal herds. OP hasn’t done that and it’s nonsense to expect a normal person to have feet like a hunter-gatherer. Also most people simply lived and died in the village they were from since we invented agriculture like 6,000 years ago. They still walked a lot, but they didn’t travel. 
This is correct. Moleskin might be appropriate if you’re sitting around the house or occasionally walking around an office or something. Other than that it’s garbage. 
Leukotape is the best option. I ignored consensus and tried white athletic tape for myself. It has the same type of adhesive and is available everywhere, but it simply doesn’t hold as well, possibly because it’s more breathable. 
As for using Leukotape as a treatment rather than a prevention, you can use a piece of non-adherent pad over the blister, essentially making a custom-sized bandaid that lasts several days. It provides a small amount of padding and keeps the tape from sticking to the skin over the blister.
that's no different than people who do manual labor for a paycheck having tough hands. Callused body parts are durable. With that said... look at the feet in videos of primitive tribes or third worlders who wear flip flops 365 days a year, they hve gnarly foot funguses more often than not.
what a retard. Infant mortality ruined that average.
Primitive Tribes have foot fungus issues
Not actually true South American and African Pigmies suffer from alcoholism and STDs but their feet are fine.
Infant mortality decreased because we put shoes on those little fuckers to keep them healthy. Try to keep up: low information posters.
Depends on the region. In Africa and the middle east you have guys who walk a lot barefoot and they never develop anything weird on their feet.
It's just the jungle fuckers that trod through mud that get all sorts of weird infections all the time.
Guess its retarded but I put deer tallow creme on my feet every evening about a week before a longer hike, either from the drugstore or those "second skin" or chamois cremes cyclists use.

Pretty interesting in that they want fewer state officials involved in the matter and might let people take simple matters into their own hands.
what will we do if this outbreak of common sense spread to other states?
i know the cunty/shitty progressives will cry foul, but god damn has coddling people ever helped, anyone, anywhere?
tfw living in oregon and every scrap of open land around eugene has turned into a defacto homeless shelter.
if some number of them were to be gassed word might get round that maybe being freeloading trash isn't a great idea. worst case scenario there would just be fewer of them shitting up the streets/parks/sidewalks.
You got any change?
posts like this make me want to visit wyoming again.
(i'd never move there, because they are obviously full and outsiders need to fuck off back whence they came.)
now you listen here sandhiller
I gots you now on trespassin
And you're fixin to get got on enguzzlement, armed slobbery and acceptin swollen goods over 2 inches
 This ain't nobody business butt ours
Are they making this whole state ram ranch?
this should only be a thing if corner crossing was also legal.
i've never heard a solid justification for banning corner crossing.
i mean the main reason seems to be to allow ranchers to control as much public land as possible, while minimizing the amount they have to own themselves in order to do it.
any other rationale?
property right are a mysterious conspiracy!!11
It's that you don't actual own property if randos are allowed to enter without permission you mentally ill parasite.
I dont think you understand what corner crossing is. You can literally step from public land to public land WITHOUT stepping on private land...and yet somehow that is trespassing because the property rights supposedly extend into the airspace....and you are supposedly violating that air space even tho you are not touching private land.
Which is essentially contradictory with the stream acess law (in MT) that allows you to travel thru private property via streambeds.
That is some extreme gold medal level mental gymnastics.
So my assessment was accurate then?

What the fuck? Doesn't the US have right of way? Here in the UK and pretty much every country I've ever been in, you can walk through any private land and only need to leave once the landowner tells you you are tresspassing. If you are just passing through they, they largely can't do shit.
enguzzlement, armed slobbery and acceptin swollen goods
Lost
It's the same in the US. Unless a property is clearly marked as "NO TRESPASSING", then you are legally allowed to be there until someone tells you to leave, which is why so many people in the US have no trespassing signs around their property. Also, despite what people here will tell you, as long as you're not a strung out drug addicted faggot weirdo, people will usually talk to you before they pull out their gun and start firing.
In America, one of the fundamental land owning concepts we have and had for hundreds of years is that you have a lawful right to exclude people from your land. That’s it, there’s no argument or persuasion, it’s a just a hard rule we have. It’s why easements exist.
lawful right to exclude people from your land
but the issue is that corner crossing doesnt infringe on private land. You literally do not step on anyone's private property by corner crossing.
be me
don't know what corner crossing is
pic related
What the fuck?
mfw people have actually been charged with criminal trespassing for this shit
Yep it’s bullshit.
100% a way to encircle and deprive the public of public land. but the owner will gladly sell you a weekend pass to transit his land to get over to the BLM land he’s gatekeeping.
There was a documentary on this. A few private land owners put up gates and locks on public easements, as the land owners were running hunting lodges and it gave their customers exclusive access to BLM areas.
We don’t know what it is yet because the suit hasn’t gone to trial. You’re taking one dudes complaint and saying it’s legal precedent.
You’re taking one dudes complaint and saying it’s legal precedent.
Im not saying anything of the sort. I am simply pointing out the facts. If you dont step on someone'e property you should be considered tresspassing
should be
shouldnt
Bonus.
Fragmenting public land into checkerboard squares so only railroad and mining companies would have access to it was unironically a conspiracy.
I hate the federal goverment as much as the next guy, but they should just make 1.5ft on each side of a corner an easement. So as long as you don't damage the fence you can cross. Or spend some of my fucking money to stall crossovers to connect public land. Would be like 50$ a pop and paying a forest janny to hike out and set it up
i dunno, these ranchers and their lawyers have names and addresses.
at the end of the day they are stealing from the public, there should be consequences
like maybe find out where they live or work, or shop -- and show up with a posse and just start tickling them. and i don't mean just a little tickle, and the resulting light giggle -- but full on, heavy duty tickling until they wet themselves. a 20 minute long multi-person tickle-fest, until they just cannot handle it anymore
but the entire premise that you are 'violating their airspace' by corner crossing is such obvious bullshit, only a lawyer would put any stock in that explanation.
cuck mindset
Unless they catch you in the middle of corner crossing, once you are in the blm land what can they actually do? They can't say you are trespassing because you are on public land at that moment. If you perfectly execute a corner cross you would only be on their land for a split second. That is not enough time to ask you to leave or point a gun and shoot at you.
Wow fuck this
Why would anyone ever put up with this shit, if I ever encounter this in real life I'll just """trespass""" and the owner can cry about it
I think in WY it’s several hundred in fines and 6mos in jail.
Ranchers/hunting lodges do not fuck around with you circumventing their paypiggie racket and will press charges.
Based ESL larper
This makes me want to go to Wyoming.
Wyoming may have the air of nothing going on backwoods but without the woods retard place to coasties but the truth is it's just a gigantic open air playground for the unimaginably rich now. They make a game out of how to strategically buy land to encircle other land so they in effect own triple or more of actual land. Because no one else can actually get to the """public""" land legally.
Isn't all that encirclement going on in the plains where grazing is viable? I think all the areas you'd want to actually hike through are easily accessed public land (Yellowstone, wind river range, Bob Marshall, absaroka)...
no coasties
I would've thought with Yellowstone there and all the ads WY would be swarming with them. And given the low population and native component they'd be flipping blue any day now.
No?
Or did the coasties all stop at Boise for now, have to wait for prices to get another +50% jacked up before they locust eastward?
I would've thought with Yellowstone there and all the ads WY would be swarming with them. And given the low population and native component they'd be flipping blue any day now.

uk 
Not anymore.
you’re a bitch lmao this is America we can go wherever we want 
same mindset as people who won’t travel to Hawaii because the locals hate white people
What.
It doesn't make sense I I can build a structure not touching your land but a few inches above it. Land owners own the air space above to whatever height.
This is separate from the absolute stupidity that is this corner crossing case, they stepped over so no big deal. I think there's much more to the case than the article suggested.
Land owners own the air space above to whatever height.
There is not a single private entity in the US that owns any amount of airspace. The federal government owns and regulates airspace. They "allow" you to interact with lower thresholds, like flying a drone or riding one of those propeller packs. But no, you do not own airspace and never will.
Please stay away. We are full
Wyoming isn't full, goober. It's one of the least densely populated states in the US.
Makes sense, my theconversation.com-slurping ultraliberal friend lives there. He whines incessantly about the local Nazis.
Are there a lot of Nazi types up there too?
WY ranch fags are the most contempt-able "i know what I got" boomers you could think of. I would not be upset if raiders murdered them in their sleep.
Which is the logical next step for thumbing one's nose at the corner trolls if they persist: flying some sort of personal quadcopter, ultralight, or other VTOL craft into the blocked-off public land. We may not have a Euro-style right to roam enshrined in law, but a right of overflight above 500ft is unequivocal.
I think all the areas you'd want to actually hike through are easily accessed public land
there is a lot of public land that is inaccessible. ONX did a paper on it...and its a bigger deal for hunters rather than hiking per se

Don't ever go full retard again. It's not a good look.
You personal experience is not a guarantee for others.

Based landchad, removing /out/istic anons from his property.
Implying coasties watch Yellowstone
What the fuck is corner crossing?
By the name i assume it was cutting across the corner of someone land, but obviously thats not the case since you said corner crossing isnt stepping foor on someone land.
Retard, "airspace" does not begin until a certain height above your property.
look at this picture>>2536706
it is crossing those corners of the checkerboard land plots.
I see. My next question would be, did the persons involved actually step over the property marker? Or did they cut through the private property
but it wasnt like they cut through much it was just a little bit so it doesnt matter!
Yeah as an Aussie I'm a bit confused. Doesn't Wyoming have easements/road reserves?
did they cut through the private property
Who cares? Right of way should overrule the few square feet you'd have to cross.
who cares
...all parties involved?
You do realize the US does not have right of way laws like some eurocuck states do.
If someone doesnt want you on their property, you have no right to be there. Passing through or otherwise.
That's private property, zoomer.
Don't come to idaho either you hapless ingrate.
I'm dying!
i mean the main reason seems to be to allow ranchers to control as much public land as possible
This is exactly what it is. I guarantee the first time some cowboy buckaroo tries to blast a BLM employee corner crossing to BLM land the law will change.
I think it's just a matter of time until a lawsuit fucks all those rich fuckers in the ass. The courts are going to smack this corner shit down as it is plainly common sense. Then they are gonna have to deal with all the hunters and rainbow fags crossing allover their lands.
Not one of, IS. Pop is in the 600k range. Doesn't even break a million. Pathetic!
The Wyoming legislature could solve this problem easily they just choose to be faggots too.
Lol...found the no land poor. It's called an easement poorfag. Like that strip of grass between the road and the sidewalk in front of a house. You can lay down on that and take a nap at a strangers house and they can't really do shit about it because it is an easement. The courts could easily declare an easement at the corners and be done with this shit. The federal congress could declare that anyone that cuts off public land in this way is a 'de facto owner' and force them to pay tax on that including all the years of back taxes. They could do that pretty easily.
Jesus fuck youre retarded. I asked if they passed through the private property or the easement
Are there a lot of Nazi types up there too?
Not him, but no. Your friend is a typical progressive who thinks anyone who doesn't favor gun control and faggot marriage is a literal Nazi. In a mostly-rural state full of traditional gun owners.
don't easements have a stated purpose though? like in your example, the easement might cover transit, as in you can cross the easement for any reason, but that's not extended to camping out on it.
like for example on my property there's an easement for firebreaks on the adjoining property, legally our neighbors could come onto our property and cut down trees to maintain the 100' firebreak around their dwelling, and vice versa. (luckily that's never been needed.) but that's the extent of the rights on the other side of the property line
the corner crossing idiocy could be handled that way, or simply state that property owners do not own the air space at corners. either way it's contrary to the spirit of public land, and they are absolutely exploiting the system for personal gain, to the detriment of the public at large. 
it's theft and should be treated accordingly.
either way it's contrary to the spirit of public land
The spirit of public land is contrary to the spirit of america.
Its not the surrounding land owners fault that the government is refusing to sell those parcels.
99% of the USA is shit. The people, the cities, the culture. The only thing worthwhile is the public land.
Best country on earth, cry about it.

Unfortunately it’s a hard truth for many redditors to accept.
peak nu-out Tbh
In the US federal regulators can determine where devices like drones and remote control airplanes can be used regardless of how "high" you fly them. For example if you live two miles from an airport its illegal to fly a drone outdoors regardless of the altitude... like anything else it's only illegal if you get caught.
Same with trees even--if you live a certain distance from an approach vector to an airport they can make you cut your trees down.
The "where does airspace begin" isn't the minimum altitude for private or commercial aircraft but the point above ground where the federal government determines what can and cant fly--which is whatever the feds want it to be.
Which is why nobody except the federal government owns "airspace". Despite all the seething in this thread.
I live in Wyoming and most of this is true. The economy is controlled by two groups - ranchers, and oil/coal guys. The government of course caters to them because they have the most money. But it's changing, due to Jackson Hole, a town on the west border. There, millionaires are getting pushed out by billionaires. All of them from coastal states. They throw a lot of money around and usually get their way. Laramie, and half of Cheyenne and Casper agrees with them.
I don't care as long as they don't start fucking with gun laws. In WY, once you turn 18 you can own any long gun and carry it in public, though few do. And at 21, you can own and concealed carry a handgun. No license required, no bullshit needed. As it should be. It's no wonder that we have so little violent crime here. Most common crimes are drunk driving and bar fights. Nobody can make a career out of it when there's a solid 60% chance that you'll be shot dead if you start causing trouble. Even the cops are pretty relaxed here, as long as you're white.
Lol
Gr8 b8
Did you really fall for that?
regardless of how "high" you fly them.
Incorrect. Like literally factually incorrect.
Why would you be wrong on the internet.
So what. For the split second you're technically trespassing, what's going to happen? The call the warden, but you're already off their land. You'll get a warning. Camp all weekend on the public land they have landlocked and make them seethe. Any fine you might get when you leave and trespass the second time is worth it.
So what.
for the most part you correct...until you arent. See>>2539888
That landowner sounds like a complete asshole.
As is his right.
care as long as they don't start fucking with gun laws. In WY, once you turn 18 you can own any long gun and carry it in public
That's a federal law, goofus.

Ah yes the fags that often go skulking about on rural Wyoming ranches, soliciting gay sex from the lonely lusty ranch hands. Finally it's open season. Larper.
How can you miss that badly.
Miss what? The seasonal migration of trespassing fags? You just a retarded rural cuck instead of a larper, then? You'd think you'd be grateful for the supposedly wandering fags. It's the only wet hole around for miles besides the animals and we know you've had your fill of ol' Bessie already. Need something to suck you before calving season starts.
nta but yeah... thats a hard miss my guy.
Isn’t this landowner a drug peddling city dweller from Baltimore?
Yep
Oh so it means nothing. If you're going to be mysterious about it, you're just covering for having nothing substantial. Pure trash then, huh. Just shitting in the wind.
What part of nta do you not understand. You just ignore everything said and call the guy a fag, is that supposed to be an argument? Because its not, its a miss.
Ooooh I get it now! You're retarded. He apparently has migrating fags on his property. He said it himself. Did you read anything, retard? Go back up the comment chain.
Why are you so mad
He's probably one of the people that was called out in the post.
Mad? I'm laughing at you, silly. But hey, you're not inventive enough to shoot the shit with apparently. 
Your low effort shit is boring. You also scared about wandering bands of fags trespassing on your acreage? That's what my first comment was about. Making fun of a stupid comment.

My buddy who served in the Green Berets, worked as a firefighter, and more agrees with the sentiment that 99% of people are shit.
Not necessarily.
Trespassing is an intentional tort. But in the case of trespassing, because the US has its head up its own ass, “intent” just means that you intentionally went into someone’s land, not that you *knowledgably* went on their land. Its a stupid petty legal distinction to get people in trouble.

Bat shit people. Lots of drugs. The city? Phoenix is hilarious. They just built an entire tower out of shipping containers, no joke. It's total shit. 100% car centered city. Hot as fuck.

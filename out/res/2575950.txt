Any Slovenian anons here? I'd like to go to Grintovec soon, maybe camp out, spend a night there. But I'm not sure which path to take (V Koncu-Grintovec?) and what to take with me since this would be my first bigger hike
bro according to the internet the longest route to the summit from any lodge is 4h... do you really need someone to spoonfeed you what to bring on a day hike? just go
Idk anon. Europoors complain if something is more then a 30 minute walk without mass transit...
You cannot even get a bus in my home state in under 60 minutes.. if it shows up. As a kid to get to half way of my county if I didn't have someone to take me would take me all fucking day by bicycle was a solid 6 hours alone. Would have to leave right after school on Friday. And spend Saturday and Sunday with friends and ride the bus to school- then the bus back home. This was the early 2000s too...

Has anyone here hiked the Juliana Trail? What was your experience? Is it well established?
Been there last year. Started from V koncu. It's a short hike without any exposed sections, but a little boring. The view is nice though. Just go and do it. Doesn't take more than a few hours anyway. Also the hut has the best soup i ever ate in my life. Its the buckwheat soup. I still dream of it sometimes. I went to Skuta and Kocna specifically so I could also stop for some of the soup on the way down

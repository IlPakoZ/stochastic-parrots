I know they're not necessarily weapons but we don't have a gardening or tool board
A modertate amount of competition is healthy but this is just nuts.
The Dillon Aero M134D minigun fires 7.62x51mm ammunition at a rate of ~6000 rounds per minute. This should prove more than a match for quickly eliminating the shrubs and bushes around your property. Good luck.
Well. Loppers and shears are different.
If you want pruners, I like Fiskars. You can also get a battery sawzall/reciprocating saw. I like Dewalt.
this might be one of the only /k/ threads ive ever seen moved to /out/
Is there Fiskars? They’re generally the “better” brand at most Burger stores when it comes to garden tools and scissors and I have been happy with almost all my Fiskars stuff. I went cheap on a lot of the shit first, and it became a pain after a few uses, so I slowly replaced it with Fiskars as I found good clearance deals in the fall and such.
/diy/ sends a lot of gardening questions over here.
I think there’s a boomer lawn care thread going on /diy/ tho.
Sheers are for boomers to make geometic shapes out of plants--which has always been tacky and retarded. There is no other reason to own them.
They can be very useful for trail maintenance.
These are the only ones I've used extensively, these ones with the extendable handles. Very useful when you need more leverage or for cutting things high up. Maybe others are better or worse, dunno, but these ones are sturdy and work well, I know that.
If imagine that pretty much all of them are pretty similar in function, as long as you're not buying cheap Chinese stuff that snaps when you try to cut something thicker than a 1/2 inch.
No one uses those for trails. The mountain bikers and national parks use hand saws. I've checked.
It's a boomer tool for topiary retardation. It has no other purpose that isn't better served by a more appropriate tool.
Easier to use them on alders and bushes on trails. Saws are for limbs of trees.
I had cheap loppers from Harbor Freight with the extendable handles and they were awful, the handles didn’t lock in place properly and would flex a ton when extended. The Fiskars are far nicer. They may be like double the price of the cheap shit, but it’s only ~$20 more and they will work for years.
I have used these for trails many, many times. Perhaps they aren't useful in your environment, but they're useful in mine.
Pic is me, couldn't find any pictures where I had loppers

I don't see them in the field but if I had to get a set this is probably the one I'd get if I were rich.

If this is a home use just get something with shit wooden handle---home use ones only get used once or twice a year.

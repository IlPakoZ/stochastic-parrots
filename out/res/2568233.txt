If so, is it the regular EVA or the inflatable one?
Just get a military issue cot.
It's for the outdoors.
yes. the standard one was the EVA foam roll but i'd step up to a modern inflatable one
It really helps prevent heat loss. We went from using a poncho liner to using these. Nice to stay dry.
I didn't use the sleeping mat my first few years as a grunt. Eventually got fucking tired of my shoulders and ass being cold in the morning, started using the issued sleeping mat (puss pad, as we called it), and never woke up even remotely cold ever again.
The MSS, the M81 woodland one in your pic, was issued with a roll-up EVA mat like pic related, though the shade of green varied depending on the year. The newer IMSS uses an inflatable mat.
What kind of field problems didn't let you bring cots?
Sure I went without cots many times when I was in the army. Mainly in airborne school and sapper school. But for real I have even slepped outside of the wire in Afghanistan which they very regularly let anyone do. Even special forces boys sleep inside the wire every chance they get. But every single time I slept outside the wire it was on a cot.
If you are taking a 6 pound 3 bag sleep system why aren't you taking a 1.4 pound aluminum cot?
Cots suffer the same cold bottom issues as hammocks
The far better thermal conductivity? Go sleep on a concrete slab.
Strictly speaking, it doesn't NEED one, but you'll have a better time if you use one. I throw an air mat between the bivy and the sleeping bag so I don't slide off it during the night.
Haven't seen an issue cot that weighs that little, or packs down small enough to be practical for carrying around. We always piled them in the LMTV.
Holy shit I must have been so drunk when I wrote that. Yeah I spent most of my time as a combat engineer doing route clearance we just piled them all on the wrecker. And sure there are light infantry units out there thank God I never was assigned to one. But drunk or not I still stand by the fact that if you are taking the giant and heavy 3 bag sleep system you might as well take a cot.
I improved on it for myself. I have a lightweight snugpack jungle bag and a lightweight sea to summit down bag, if I use them together I'm pretty comfy down to about 15 degrees. It's a much smaller system. The army taught me a lot of good ideas, you just need to get the industrial scale production and teaching to retards aspects out of it.
If you're not in a tent or dug shelter for some insane reason you can hang a blanket off the edges to prevent blow-under.
I might have known, kek
I have picrel and I use an inflatable sleeping pad, I keep getting holes in it so I’m probably just going to get a foam one and cut it down to the size of my upper body/waist to save on bulk/weight and just use that. I’m a little bitch and I sleep in the fetal position anyway.
They issue a therm a rest self inflating pad now, but I've yet to use it.
You know they make things call ultralight cots. Google it.. buy one in your price range if you're a big guy- check the weight rating but pretty much they're all the same.. won't let you sleep on your side without a self inflating sleeping pad anyway.. 
A. The cot keeps the pad from popping on dumb shit.
B. cot and pad combo keep the crawly bitey shit off of you. Had a tent full of fireants one time due to a loose cough drop. Not tagged once at night cause my UL cot setup.
C. Cot and pad combo keep you warm enough to 40ish degrees. Sleeping bag and you're good till -10freedom units.
If you plain air sleeping. Snakes won't crawl up to you like laying directly on the ground.
Downside to cots? The feet fuck up tent floors.... So be warned if you have a bathtub style tent.
Fabric actually stretches weirdly on some of them and will not put together straight anymore poles won't be bent it's the fabric that gets funky..
Slept on an UL cot for a whole ass year. It's worth the extra weight.
yes but the mss also sucks major balls except i really like the bivvy
it really doesnt though.
When it was 50 bucks all together it was cool but between the bulk and weight, combined with rising costs it really isn't worth considering seeking out one. The bivy is still pretty cool for cold weather though, but as far a minimalism a small tarp can do more especially when the bivy weighs like 2lbs.
the new(ish) UCP MSS is still incredibly cheap, not mention lighter. also the bulk isnt really a problem since how often are you carrying the entire kit? the bivy and patrol bag are good enough for 3 seasons.
It's still cheaper to get a used MSS than to buy current sleep systems on the civvy market. You could get cheap bags and layer them, but they won't be made for it like the MSS.
And?
I'm seeing like 200+ for stuff in UCP. I'm not say it doesn't sorta work but saving a few more pennies could get you a a nice tarp and a down quilt that I think ultimately is nicer setup. For the LARP you do you but I would never advise it for a new person. If bulk and weight weren't concerns I'd still recommend a tarp and a Coleman bag. Cheaper and more comfortable with the tarp.
not saying it doesn't sorta work
Because it does work.
muh larp
No, it just works.
Good for rain, bad for bugs, not really multi-season.
Y tho
also that shit is not 5kg
Yeah so like, 4.5kg. I'm just thinking for the same price you could probably snag a top quilt, maybe a liner, and wrap it in either a poncho or tyvek and just get rid of around 3 kilos right there. Idk maybe I just don't get it.
I'll stick with the MSS.
You don't bring the black unless it's below 40F. you don't need the stuff sack if you have a backpack that fits it +your stuff. If you bring the gore tex, you don't need a tent. and vice versa.
suck my cot
In my experience yes. I would probably go with a close cell foam if you can do it or a thinner inflatable pad. Inside the bivy cover you don't want to put so much additional height that your body is crushing the insulation above you against the gortex shell.
If you can use anything else I probably would at this point. The MSS is a great all in one when you get it cheaper, now they are getting stupid money for them in a lot of places. If the only option is an MSS for 350+ imo I'd rather put money towards a different bivy and spend a little more to get maybe a good 3 season bag and a liner. For around the same price as a like new MSS you can likely get less volume and weight. If you already have it or get it dirt cheap it's still a fine system.
If you really want to LARP as a soldier, buy a klymit inflatable sleeping pad, a woobie, use the hot weather sleeping system, bivee, and you’re set
Save weight, and you’ll be warm enough for the field

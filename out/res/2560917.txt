What's some good/outlit/
bump
i really like Mors Kochanski´s "Bushcraft"
other then that i only have various mushroom/plant/tree identification books, and raising kids with nature in mind stuff
I’ve read this, tl:dr is anything modern is garbage, do it the old fashioned way. But this book is more for extended wilderness survival rather than backpacking trips
I'll try and post some of the books I've purchased on a whim, but I can't comment about the quality beyond the cursory glance I've given them
First and most inconsequential: General Survival guide.
Ask other anon's about their preferences and go-to's, this is just the one I bought myself. 
It contains a brief glance at survival skills you might rely on in a short term survival situation, some of which will be important to your day-to-day camping and hiking. Knots are good example, which this book does have a few of, and is much more intuitive to use over searching it on your phone at a whim.
Slow tech: novel hand-made techniques and methods. 
I most fondly remember a sections regarding extracting plant dyes; yellow/brown onions being a mainstay. Most involving simmering the onion skins and adding the clothing afterwards, another section added spinach for vibrant green colours.
Beyond that it's mainly a guide for simple /out/ recipes or ideas you can do in or away from home: 
Beer (ginger/brew)
Fire/wood
Clay/ovens 
Meat (meals and prep)
Stone working (flint, Drystone)
Water treatment
Based. Unironically.
Ray Mears is a reliable source as I've heard in person and beyond. This piece serves as a nice Introduction to simple and advanced /out/ knowledge: from navigation and compass to animal tracking, knots, fires and survival miscellaneous.
More Ray Mears: more advanced material and methods, including cutting tools, shelter, more knots, extreme environments and a more biographical read; involving personal experience and suggestions.
Gary Paulsen books. Alternately, My Side of the Mountain. Classics.
The introduction you can just tear out and use for fire starter
The entire Foxfire series is pretty good.
Seconding this.
Where the red fern grows
Hatchet
Fellowship of the ring
Truly one of the best /out/ recommended books I’ve read.
Also desert solitaire.
details surveying the 49th parallel in 1857, i gave this book to my grandpa who surveyed alaska for the pipeline way back when and he got a real kick out of it.
this book makes ultralightfags seethe
Where the red fern grows
yup, timeless book
Reading it at the crack of dawn with some power bait on the line and fresh brewed coffee in hand is kino
do it the old fashioned way
what do you mean? trial and error?
FM 21-76 US Army Survival Manual
I recently read this and I also read his book Camping and Woodcraft. they are both great , the our southern highlands is more focus what an interesting place the smokies used to be, it makes me sad to see the strip at pigeon forge and gatlinburgh, I rather be lost in the rhododendron. His book on camping and wood craft , is a camping guide from 100 years ago but pretty much still sums up the thoughts and arguments of backpacking that I still on this board today. But the biggest difference is his gear is so different but there something to learn in learning the meta of a past day. He has work arounds for antibiotics with using different antiseptics and medicines. one of my favorite /out/ books
I'll check this book out. Trying to figure out which of the versions on Amazon is the best lmao.

This a shitpoast thread

my side of the mountain, truly inspirational sense childhood.

I found this weird stuff written on a rock near the summit of a hill when I was out hiking recently. 
I'm convinced it's a larp, but I'm pretty curious since I've never seen something like this before ; I walk this specific route often, the nearest town is 6miles away and there are no roads within a 4 mile radius, just for ref.
I hike almost every second week, sometimes even three times a month. I was under the impression this kind of stuff was exclusive to video games.
If any anons have seen similar things whilst out in nature (idk, strange writing in general, or any fonts similar to the one in pic rel) please do share your experiences.
If this thread gains some traction, I'll give more details. I eventually want to translate this stuff, any help would be appreciated
I've never seen anything like this /out/ but the symbols themselves look kinda Greek-ish. I only know the Greek alphabet from studying math, though.
The tilde at the beginning of the second row is sometimes used as a negation operator. The third symbol on the bottom row looks like a half-arrow, which might mean "material conditional without logical entailment" but that's not a standard usage or anything, just the only obvious meaning I can come up with.
Consider posting to /sci/ and letting those mathfag more schizo than I take a run at it.
I see what you mean. 
I'll look into what you've said, I'll also ask the /sci anons.
Thank you
This ain't greek. Where you found it?
Its literal graffiti 
Some dumb faggots pathetic replacement cipher 
Probably some 12 year old fag
this, sorry OP, this isn't your magic ticket to Hogwarts.
Closest thing that comes to mind is Inuit/aboriginal language
it's almost certainly a simple substitution code, the symbol on the tailing ends of the first two lines is probably an 'e'
I'll let someone with autism try to figure out the rest
After spending way too much time following this line of thinking, I can confirm the message reads "Inlands and bipeds...sbeds... Racial"
No need to thank me
that's the ancient tomb of ubuntu, or as I've taken to calling it lately, tomb + ubuntu
Try to ask on /x/ there is at least one crackhead un the know there
Ge'ez
Often times you can use statistics to break simple substitution ciphers.
Certain letters appear more often than others in the English language.
Thats sharpie OP if it was anything remotely old it would've been weathered down significantly

Newfag here. What are your recommendations for hiking clothes, and where can I try/buy them? I live in a warm climate btw
any sporting clothes store will have brand name hiking clothes. 
wait for sales since the good shit is breathtakingly expensive. generally you just want to avoid cotton
You can hike in literally any clothes you have. Especially if it's hot out. If you are going into the mountains and it's going to get cold then yes you need to ditch cotton and plan layered clothing. But luckily for you it's springtime and you live where it's hot. So you don't need to worry about that.
I'll be motorcycle camping and I'm not sure what to do with my gear. Guess I will have to store my helmet, armoured leather coat, and leather boots inside a big waterproof duffle. I will probably have to use running shoes or crocks when in camp mode and also fit comfortable hiking clothes
Really anything if you'rr not disgustingly unfit. People think you "need" hiking clothes but come on, dude. You're just walking. 
Basically any run of the mill athletic wear will work. Non-cotton for cold weather. For example I just hiked 16 miles wearing adidas track pants and a synthetic Tshirt.
Thrift shops are your friend.
i can give better advice if you give a more specific climate than just hot. desert? tropical island? etc.
warm climate
ignore any cotton bad or cotton kills advice. its correct but not in that kind of climate most of the year.
cotton is good in warm climates, especially loose and baggy cotton.
the other generalized advice to ignore for warm climates is anyone recommending you wool products. they are great, everywhere else.
general warm environment tips:
cotton good
synthetics good
tank tops good t shirts bad
loose fitting clothes are the meta unless you need wicking layers
being white sucks
you have to choose between the neck gaiter+cap look, cowbow look, boonie cap look, rice paddy look, arab look etc.
if you go for the arab look support terrorism and get your keffiyeh from https://www.hirbawi.ps/ (they have a store on amazon too)
in my experience its the most versatile if you do not care about appearances.
tight fitting garments are best in white or light colors. the color does not matter for loose fitting garments, you can wear black just fine.
i like loose fitting thin cotton or cotton/nylon blend pants sort of like those desert storm era bdu pants for hiking in hot environments that have ticks. good compromise where you can't rock shorts.
shoes > boots
wet+hot sucks, mechanical venting with your rain gear and shelter is the key to making it suck less
depends on your race. if you're dark skin, sure.
i'm from iceland and used to live in a tropical environment for a while. i definitely can't do that unless i want to have more cancer than skin. i have to dress so goofy to not get sunburned.
this is genuinely good advice
outside of what you wear on your head, most of hot weather hiking gear is no different than what you find in the athletic section of goodwill, save for exceptionally hot climates or difficult trips.
another pro gamer tip:
the overpriced and currently very trendy "sun hoodies" are the same thing as gook fishermen have been wearing for ages, they're 10 dollars if you buy it marketed as a fishing hoodie instead. same cut material and everything. great garment for hot weather by the way. the meme is worth falling for.
90% of what i wear for hot climate hiking came from goodwill athletic section. ripstop shorts and a thin polyester tee 1 or 2 sizes too big. done and done.
cotton is decent in the heat until it gets over 90 and humid, then it just turns into a fucking sponge for your sweat and doesn't breathe at all. loose cotton is GOAT in dry heat but once it's swampy out I go for spandex/polyblend up against the skin for moisture wicking and quick evaporation/evaporative cooling
agreed on the adidas track pants. I've worn a pair of them for multiple week long canoe trips. They're cool during the day, dry off quickly, nice and light, and keep you pretty warm at night.
NOOOOOO YOU NEED TECHNICAL AND LIGHTWEIGHT MATERIALS DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE
I wear hunting boots and a hat with old regular clothes. Pants and shirt doesn't matter at all. 
No you don't.
just buy cheap elbow and knee caps you can leave in your bike and use a chain to secure the helmet. Just cover the helmet with a tarp.
Boots, light long sleeve shirt, cotton, wool, or linen work fine, just make sure they are long sleeve. 
Good pants, nylon, denim(Though i recommend you use a good broken in pair of denim) a nice hat, and or bring a shemagh.
Not OP, but I have a similar yet less retarded question
what is the best material shirt to wear in a hot/humid environment, assuming I will be wearing this one shirt for weeks at a time, extra clothes are heavy and unnecessary for my purposes, I will be sweaty and nasty all the time anyways so I donâ€™t care
I'm also a newfag but go hiking a lot more than most people I know.
Waterproof Hiking Shoes
consistently my favorite purchase, comes in handy so much
Yeah they're expensive but I just purchased a pair before my last trip and holy fuck second favorite purchase after the shoes. I used to get crazy calluses and fucked up feet after a long day of hiking but that went away with these socks, plus they didn't smell after two days of hiking and sweating which was pretty great
Other than that idk. I'll be monitoring this thread
Terrorist-chic only works in the dry heat of their godforsaken deserts. Allowing the dry air to circulate and rapidly evaporate moisture. 
Once the humidity gets up there the heavier cottons and such just get saturated and stays hot. Breathable synthetics are a must inna swamp.

are you planning on camping during the rain or just dry camping? your gear is fine just sitting out.. even all day in the sun. its as I do.. sometimes ill hand my helmet on the triple, and throw my jacket over top so its not so hot putting it on. but thats it. 
I'd advise putting your helmet always facing as you wear it on your head, the british have a superstition that you want to keep the helmet the direction you wanna keep your head.
But I have a more logical and experienced lesson. when you park in the shade an a big ass bird decides to shit onto your stuff. what is easier to clean shit out of? the nice smooth outer shell of your helmet, of the nice supple fabric interior?
summer camping around the Kootenays. Good point about keeping the avian elements apart from my apparel. I didn't know that about British motorcycle superstitions, though, that is neat. I know some fags like to keep those bell gremlins things to ward of debris in the road but I don't believe in pagan witchcraft
Kilm Outlander boots.
these might've been good if I bought them first but I already spent $400 on my motorcycle boots so I'd rather just bring a second pair of hiking boots with me
why?
OP quit your baby style and wear what you like mommy wont help
for most of my appalachian trail hike i wore a quick dry t-shirt i found at a thrift store and soffe ranger panties
i wear plus sized lingerie

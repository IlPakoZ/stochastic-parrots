I’ve been interesting in strawberries recently, very delicious fruit and just bought 5 more plants today. I got 2 acres of land in the back that could probably be converted to strawberry farms if I wanted to, but I was wondering if this could turn in a profit. How much strawberry plants do I need to turn a profit for my hard work?
Its best to get grow them in little raised beds with lots of compost in them they love a lot of nutrients
'Strawberry farms' were big where I used to live
Most were 2-5 acres attached to bigger farms
People bring their kids or dates and they give you a bucket to pick your own
It would be a full time job for a few people and not very profitable
Here in south germany we pay east europeans to do the work. You should do the same at some point
Exploiting polish immigrants is on my checklist
Perhaps I could diverse and expand then? Making strawberry jam, making my “farm” a tourist spot of some way? (Pick your own strawberries) etc?
The places Ive been to were successful because they were side hustles attached to big family farms, with Mexicans to maintain the plots and family members to run the business side
You cant plant, weed, water, do pest/bug control, sales and advertising all at the same time for a couple months a year and stay profitable
Or maybe you can, prove me wrong
Yeah now that I think of it, that would be a shit ton of work and problems to manage. Is there just no hope for making a gardening hobby a job, something I really enjoy and am passionate about? There’s no crop that’s really possible to pull it off with reasonable labor?
One secret is to grow heirloom crops, they can be several times more valuable than the standard variety. Family farms down here are having to specialize. Bamboo, or heirloom crops, some corn farmers switched to fields of cannabis instead. Just to survive and keep the farm.
Growing fields of legal cannabis though not a crime, they have a license as of 2019. As industrialization and collectivization of agriculture into large factory farming food corporations progresses, family farms have to adapt to survive. Gross income on strawberries per acre, according to recent figures, is pretty high at $20k per acre. That's not accounting for your costs as well. You can certainly manage 2 acres by hand, and you could get by, but you could plant half an acre of a more valuable species of strawberry and yield the same return, and they are also very popular at farmer's markets. It's just a higher grade of crop.
Same with ranchers, lot of family ranching operations are now focusing on high grade, open range, grass fed beef. Because the factory farms raise beef at the lowest possible cost on an industrial scale, using steroids and hormones, on monsanto feed or something similar, then covering in preservatives for supermarkets.
Grow them in hanging baskets and start a you-pick. Very popular in Nippon.
this anon gets it... still, check out how the Japs do it.
My family owns and operates a cattle ranch in Montana. Almost all the grass fed beef ends up at the same meat processing factories as the corporate beef. The last month or so before slaughter the cattle are railed from the fields they were raised in to a midwest slaughter house. The final fattening diet for the beef is different than what they were fed while being raised. 
This "system" was basically forced on farmers to prevent them from individually slaughtering and selling their own meat on open market without going through an FDA control center--which is very illegal.
you should consider using africans on your strawberry farm like they do in spain. the workers live in small sheds made out of plastik and old pallets, get a couple € for theri work and once they get sick from the chemicals that are beeing used they get send back to africa. they have this system in most south european countries
I would say start small and go vertical. Everything under the sun, big to small, wants to eat your delicious berries, so you have to keep an eye on them. If you're in a Mediterranean climate, they grow as perennials; popping up from the soil anew winter after winter after winter. Your main foes are gonna be birds and ants. Get it off the ground and that should stop the ants for a good while. For the birds, you have netting, scarecrows, or just growing them out of the way where they can't see them easily. 
If I was in your position, I would grow a patch on the ground as a permanent source of runners and just do pic related, but with like 50 buckets in a greenhouse. Once you figure out how to grow lots of them, then you can focus on profiting off of them.
I’ll definitely put this advice into planning, and I live in the azores, not exactly a Mediterranean climate but I think it could apply to it.
I don’t get it
You'll probably be fine in the Azores unless it's tremendously humid there. I can't convey enough how much the number of individual plants matters when it comes to these boys. A good, heavy growing, healthy strawberry plant is, at the most, going to give you 2 berries a week. You really need a lot of plants to get heaping baskets of berries.
I've only ever eaten store bought strawberries which all tasted very sour
Solution: Kill yourself you fucking faggot. You will never own a farm, stop larping and go back to a 9 - 5 job you absolute idiot. Give it up and stop projecting your ignorance on this board already you newfag.
Why so demotivational?
What's wrong with setting goals and working to acheive them?
Its the one meme he has saved to her computer
he posts it in every thread he visits
just filter it
You can do it but it'll take some planning and determination. Are you going to do a "you pick it" or sell preharvested berries ? I assume you don't have any equipment right now. So you would need see if anyone would be willing to prepare the soil for you. Also it would really help if you got someone to lay plastic mulch. You can plant the plugs yourself. Watering will be a bitch since you can't rely on rain. Fertilizing also would be a pain as most strawberry farmers use water soluble fertilizers and inject it into the irrigation system. Weeding also would be a pain unless you use chemicals. Using wheel hoe would help getting the weeds in between the rows. Then you need to come back and get the hard to reach ones. Harvesting would be very labor intensive but it can be done. Alot of bending and repeat movements.
Btw almost all commerical strawberry farms use plastic mulch to control weeds and to warm the soil and retain moisture. They also use drip lines under the plastic for irrigation. Also strawberries are replanted every 2-3 years to keep the berries uniform size.

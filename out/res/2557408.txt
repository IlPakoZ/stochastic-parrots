What’s your favorite meal to cook after a long hike? For me it’s a good roast or some kind of stew. It’s hearty and filling and puts me straight to sleep.
Anyone who carries all the necessary ingredients and equipment to make a stew or roast has never been on a long hike. The correct answer is peanut butter and tortillas
Yeah okay, bud. If you pack it as the first night’s meal with frozen meat it will be perfectly thawed by the end of day 1. Sorry you only take foods that an autistic child can make.
How long is day one?
Usually about 15 miles. Most of the time I do 3-4 day hikes.
half a can of spam
I like picrel as a meal or as a base with chorizo and rice/bread. 25 portions of hearty mushroom soup in a small tub
Lots of instant noodles (the good asian brands, i love em)
Tins of spicy macrel/sardines on fire toast
Fruit
Peanuts/chocolate raisins for energy
Rabbits or fish that I catch
Can carry butter without it spoiling, at reasonable temps. Definitely a nice addition
Teas/coffee/energy drinks
Small plastic bottle of whiskey/jaegermeister for a nightcap
I grab some fresh foods on the way out like ready-made sandwiches/pies for the first evening, to conserve my packed goods. With the listed supplies I can happily do 2-5 nights. There isn't much point in overthinking it unless you're heading out into serious wilderness.
Yeah ok
15 miles in a day is pathetically slow, less than 2 mph assuming just 8 hours of hiking
God I hate this larping bullshit.
Obvious b8 but Hike whatever distance you feel comfortable with man. No one’s controlling you.
Replace that with a can of deenz and some Powerade and you got it. 
Shut the fuck up newfag. Not everything is bait. Jesus.
You’ll need the Powerade after a long butt fucking sesh in the wilderness with your boyfriend
Here‘s a really crazy idea, bear with me:
Everyone can enjoy being outside in the ways that they enjoy.
Radical, I know
Hey flatland dweller, some of us have actual terrain to deal with.
Wow bro that is so fucking heavy omg how can anyone carry that my god so much weight
No thanks. I will carry more weight and eat proper meal so I don't feel like shit after eating goyslop for 5 days
Nice meme.
Eat more fiber
These are the people who don’t hike. Some of them prioritize camping (which is fine), and some have never been outside. Most of their opinions are shit.
I hike. Stop the gatekeeping.
One of the best ways to hike (or camp, idgaf) is to bring awesome food mostly pre-prepped. I'll fill a 40 oz Nalgene with stew and bring a home baked loaf of french bread and some butter for the first night, that's the buena vida niggas. My old lady makes the bombest of burritos in every flavor, or quiche, or anything else that's heavy on fat that you crave after putting in some vert. Freeze the filling and bring the torts seperate.
Before you malign my ability to make distance carrying heavy shit, I'm tall and 240 lbs, I could carry most of you twinks in my fanny pack, if I had one.
If distance is your measure of grit, then cut your toothbrush in half and subsist on dried pig dicks and Tang, more power to you. You'll never see us, off-piste bushwhacking to the ultimate sites you'll never see while you're head down trying to get somewhere in a hurry. Check your strava again, you're almost on pace for thirteenth place.
Yeah I never get a bad stomach from hot food even if it's red hot. Quite the opposite really
Quality of terrain &amp; destination > distance, although they are often related. 
I live near one of the clusterfuck capitals of the outdoors yet somehow we don't see anyone for days after leaving the TH. 
Pic related, didn't see a single person the whole day. No tracks, the first ones in that area this spring. 
We ate tuna sammiches, pepperoni, cheese and crackers and drank the snowmelt unfiltered, it was delicious.
Kek, you're so dumb even your friends can tell. I can dunk a spookball and rek your shit at any sport. Also I have photos from the great outdoors, which is more than you can say. I piss on you from considerable height, Paco.
It’s true everywhere. I took a trip to Zion years ago and the Disney Words comparisons are true until you get a few hours from the trailheads. The buses that run through the park were so packed we had to wait for a second one. It was peak season and it was to be expected, and we saw a few people on the trail but it was really shocking how few. The same for Great Smoky Mountain NP last year. Clingman’s Dome lives up to the “expectation/reality/ meme, and that where I parked. But for four days I saw like 4 groups of people, and all of them were on the AT section.
I'm sorry pal but spicy thai chili tuna is the bomb. I will never stop consuming it.
Onions fuck me up more than habaneros..
Anyone who has been out long enough and got a piece of fresh meat and a couple of vegetables a month in knows how much that stuff will make your mouth water
Either rice balls or something sturdy enough to be carried around all day at room temperature. Bringing some stew is cool, but really just give me water and a few basic survival snacks and I'll catch the rest maybe trout or salmon, or perhaps a turkey if I'm very lucky
I am so, so sorry that you do not get to enjoy the pure pleasure that is an onion centric diet.
Stew is made in heaps of ways. You can literally make a stew in a jetboil or a kidney cup, stew doesn't have to be an all day 5 person meal cooked in a massive fuck off cast iron pot. You can even buy it in bags, just warm it up and you're ready to go.
Personally, I like venison steak and blackberry jam after I take down a deer and harvest some berries after a long day of hiking
yeah but imagine carrying a cast iron pot like op, holy shit
That’s a pic from google you retard. I carry a lightweight pan.
holy shit why.
i dont believe you. I usually take some kind of frozen meat like sausages and buns for the first day. the idea that someone is carrying around a roast, potatoes and carrots and broth which are extremely calorie light to weight ratio is laughable. Do you take your microwave and car battery too? Just say you day hike and cook it at home, its fine.
I have done that backpacking. pack a frozen steak and by the end of the day its thawed and ready to cook
My sympathies, anon
White people call it a “food coma.”
Day hikes with the cast iron are actually fun. You get get there in the morning, spend the entire day at your site screwing around and cooking a delicious stew, and then clean up and go home once the sun starts to set. A perfect day. I don't get why /out/casts try to act all tough like you're somehow "cheating" or a fraud unless you spend 15 days straight in the wilderness with nothing but a 15 pound pack, living off dehydrated meals and filtered swamp water.
Did you read the OP? Please explain the synopsis of it.
kek, gotta love Americans
Irrelevant. I was responding to the post that I quoted, not OP. OP never even said anything about cast iron. You just made a dumb assumption based on his cozy picture.
Learn to read. OP asks favorite for meal to cook after a long hike. Start your own thread if you want to bitch about distance elitism. Which is both real and completely valid by the way.
Yes, you responded to a post about hiking, which was referencing the OP, which is about hiking. I never said anything about cast iron either.
Seriously bruh, get the fuck out.
Goulash, if i'm staying a couple of days i do a proper one in a stove pot but if i am on a day trip i usually bring one with some bread. its glorious.
Do people actually expect that to do something?
You clearly did in: >>2559815
This is a symptom of schizophrenia
You clearly aren't capable of following the conversation in that case, since my critique was directed specifically at the post I was quoting. If you don't want to be mistaken for someone else, then don't white knight their posts as if they're your own.
Again, the post you were quoting was about hiking, as it followed what the OP was talking about. You’re the one who can’t follow the conversation. The topic, for the third time, is hiking. Not car camping.
I never said anything about car camping. You can go for a short dayhike with cast iron, especially if you're in a group. I've done it.
You rule makers are a bunch of fags, and you're probably short. 
Are we allowed to carry tall cans 4000 vert in five miles, if it's the first night? I don't even like beer that much but I'll carry some for my girl just to feel the weight drop off.
I don't see many pics you city niggers.
How bout a slab of HAM and a fat chaw after 3.5 miles of bushwhacking? Is that allowed?
Here's something good to bring, make a bunch of these. They'll keep for a couple days without freezing.
Usually use an egg wash on em but wanted to try without, they were still good.
Here's some food for you distance lords, you can eat some paint brushes
Nigger how is that not car camping? How do you get there in the morning and spend the entire day at a campsite? Did you hike in at night?
I'm the only person in this thread to post /out pics, you are all useless.
Is this an image board or not. Get your shit together nerds
Akchually just fuck off and eat a fart sandwich
How do I get a 40yo out girlfriend?
Be taller
That’s a man
One minute bikini weather, the next lightning and gully washers. The West is the best
Still no pics eh
Ima let you finish but my fav is chile verde burritos after a long haul. Pic unrelated
The longest hike you Shitneequas do is to the bathroom at wallyworld
If the stew is too heavy maybe bring a lighter tent. Maybe stop being a pussy idk
Just because you drive a car to your entry point doesn't mean it's car camping you retard
I can't really do a lot of distance any more, but I do love proper campfire steaks. There's something about carving up a bigass hunk of beef with a fixed blade and making four caveman steaks roasted on sticks.
ITT: goyslop
Fugg yeah, and frozen steaks can keep until day 2 breakfast at least. Bring several.
Beef jerky and dried bananas
get there
What did you do after that? Did you spend part of the day hiking to a campsite?
spend your entire day at your site screwing around and cooking
Pretty comfy, sure. But you did go hiking, right?
You’re right, it’s not car camping. It’s a picnic or bbq or something.
Of course. That's why I called it a day hike and not a day drive.
Its possible that some people have physically trained themselves to be a pack mule by routinely carrying heavy bags. That person is not moving any faster going ultralite. Ultralite hikers are 90 pounds body weight and unable to ruck gear but maybe share the board outside of that niche or make friends with one since they can handle rucking in the gear.
/out/ is a newb echo chamber
In that the echo is almost always a variation of "fuck you", yes
Tiresome and newbish
Me and my brother have a tradition going back to the 90s. We would spend a week or two camping in the White Mountains and would do one big hike or maybe two small hikes, and always return to the cozy campground after to recover. 4 days huffing ass across the Presidentials? Stop at MackDonalds on the way home. 1 day huffing ass up to Glen Boulder and Mt Isolattion? Stop at MackDonalds on the way home.
I'm sure plenty of people have enjoid McDicks as much as me and my bro over the last 25yrs, but nobody has enjoid it more.
Sorry for the blogpost and the boring answer but for me, it'll always be that calorie dump as my favorite post-/out/ meal.
nta, but yes
Can i has recipe for FARD SAMMICH? xD
whos dat your mom
Look at my balls, nagglers
I would put those balls in my mouth
Meat, vegetables, and fruit is the normal human diet. How far some modern humans have strayed.
How long does it take you to harvest 1 trips worth?
See: >>2557455
That's larping? Lmao lol. What do you eat for a meal anon?
mmmm that's a tasty meatball.... NOT THAT A NIGGER WOULD KNOW HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It can’t be both
I just posted in the potato thread that all food threads on /out/ separate the people that go on extended outings (generally hiking) from those that don’t. It’s painfully obvious who’s just shitposting and who acktchually has experience.
as easy and short as possible. Best just buy something if possible.
Oh gee whiz you got me there, check mate i guess.
Who gives a shit, you some sort of try-hand pretend elitist? As long as people are enjoying the /out/doors that's all that matters. You're not impressing anyone.
Tell it to the faggots saying backpacking food is le bad.
Eh, it's not that much weight unless you bring a god damn cast iron dutch oven or something.
Plus, it's worth the extra sweat and sore muscles to have a good fucking meal after a long, cold day.
Based. 
"Backpackers" are the most insufferable people on this board by a comfortable margin.
Shashlik with roasted onions, tomatoes and potatoes.
I just slice some bread open and fill it with ham, sardines or tuna.
based /cannadeenz/ poster
But they also seem to be the only people with any kind of experience or knowledge base.
That's not remotely true, but thanks for providing Example #50231 for why backpackers are the most insufferable group on /out/
It’s very true and this thread proved it.
Speaking as someone who was a security guard (lots of walking) up until last month? Luncheon meat mixed into white rice or macaroni and cheese, lentil mash with dried veggies, corned beef mixed into white rice, canned fish in fideo noodles, tortillas topped with canned ham and ez-cheese or with trail mix and peanut butter. These are things I could pile into a backpack-sized sterilite and carry into nowhere for a week.
Humanitarian Daily Rations are very cheap now. Fifty bucks for a case of ten. Two of those is a weeks' worth of food if you stretch it.
Going to grab more Knorr packets today. You can use powdered nobfat milk and cooking oil in place of lowfat milk and butter. Could probably use canned chicken in those. Have to brown it first...
All vegetarian, btw. And they taste like absolute ass compared to MRE’s.
I enjoy OP's post. I don't enjoy your tryhard garbage. Go flex about hardcore your hikes are at your hostel, maybe some of the other homeless drug addicts will find them impressive.
fpwp
stop taking prozac
That other guy's post was also irrelevant because the OP specifically meantioned cooking his meal AFTER he finishes his hike and not during. It's like these backpacking retards have no concept of a base camp.
You mean car camping. Otherwise OP did carry all of that stuff on a hike.
Im more into ultra light camping so for food i use various flavored vapes
You can just say you’re gay and not use confusing words like “ultralight”
We prefer to use our code, like when i see people with solomans or mids, that way we know who is DTF
Kekd. You guys ever put a big rock in your frend's pack when they're not looking?
That trick would be 10x better if you did it to a weight weenie.
you're supposed to put your water in their pack so that not only does their pack get heavier, but your pack gets lighter
I like that idea. Will do tomorrow
I hate UL fags so much it's unreal.
I have bad knees so I usually only hike around 10 miles a day, then spend the rest of the time around my campsite exploring. I like making Mac Cheese with pineapple and hot sauce. Sometimes I put cut up sausage in it too
Why are you huffing ass?
That looks so good, anon. Chorizo, hash Browns, and pepper jack?
nice food pics anon, looks cosy af.
i see meat and vegetables in the pot, anon.
Red beans and rice, a T-bone steak, biscuits.
The thought process of the true blue falcon in its natural habitat
I usually just order delivery. Like apparently much of /out/ I classify staying home as "camping" and the stairs as "long hikes". You might as well just take the microwave, lead acid car batteries and solar panels "hiking" too if you're going to bring 10 lb cast iron pots.
That's called having your gut bacteria killed off by all the beer and junk food. Eat more yoghurt.
A burger. Pre-slice everything at home, freeze the beef. By the time you are ready for dinner the beef will be thawed
Opinion discarded
You mean you guys don't parachute your way 40 miles into the forest and make it back home on foot? Fuckin car campers ngmi.
Is a wok too excessive?
Oh no, how will I carry all that??!!
You must be severely autistic if you actually eat tortillas and fucking peanut butter instead of proper food and think that cooking is difficult or requires much equipment.
None of your business how fast anyone hikes or what he does on the way. God you're such a piece of shit.
I like to stop often to enjoy the view, or walk around checking interesting places I found on map or saw on my way.
I often stop to take pics or make some sketches
Hello felow 40yo. I used to post a lot of pics from outs few years back when I was hyped about it, but than I stopped giving a fag, after this comfy board got infested with incels redpillers and other basement filth, who love to spread their cancer in "normal" places. 
What coffe filter is that? I use paper ones to clear water before I boil it, but it's painfully slow.
is that... rice inside a bun? Explain.
don't actually be glib anon
Thanks broheems. That batch was taco beef (from a good butcher), scratch hashbrowns, onions, cream cheese, pepper jack and maybe some mozza, can't remember. They look better and prob keep better with an egg wash, didn't do it that time. Good with some fresh salsa if you have it.
Que paso compadre! Love the sketch, poast moar but I understand not wanting to cast pearls here.
If you mean the bread, it's an easy mix of olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, green onions and whatever cheese you have. Stuff the mix in the bread, put two tablespoons of melted butter over the top, wrap it up and 350 oven for 23 minutes or so. Doesn't last at parties, always gets chowed down right away.
The meatballs are just spicy meatballs bbq'd with some sauce put on at the end.
Coffee filter in post >>2560651 is a GSI Outdoors iirc. Super easy cleanup, would recommend.
Thats an oryginal dish, will try it out, does it have a name? Will have to try it out.
Looks like a good design, and it doesn't cost arm and a leg like a lot of stuff, already ordered.
Sausages and onion in chicken stock and butter, add butter beans to soak the juices, abit of soda bread too. Perfect scenario is it cooks while I square away myself and my camp and I eat it as the sun sets.
I cooked this 16th century Romanian pot roast with parsnips and garlic sauce in a Dutch oven a few times at home, not outdoors. It might be a good idea to make when you are casually camping or at a cabin with friends and family though. Not sure if I managed to make the garlic sauce exactly the right consistency though. I doubled the recipe (parsnips were tripled and you could even still do a little more) and managed to fit it all still in the Dutch oven and it fed five people.
https://youtu.be/Y3R_ljOuptM [Embed]
The sauce was kinda mediocre too in my opinion, but again I’m not sure if I made it right. Regardless, I definitely think you should include garlic somehow to add flavour and ward off evil.
That sounds really good!
Check out this pussy kek
Another tiny boi or a phatty?
that looks so good
"I cut off my toothbrush handle to save 0.2 ounces, I wonder if my ex wife will be jealous"
I know most of you are American white and aren't as familiar with this dish, but we got a bomb ass dish in the Mediterranean known as shakshuka. Very old world and rustic. Just need some olive oil, eggs, peppers ( I use 1 jalapeno, 1 anaheim, 1 red bell, and 2 red fresnos) and 1 onion, cooked in a a can of diced tomatos, eaten with bread. Spices I use are kosher salt, black pepper, coriander powder, touch of cumin and cayenne pepper (just premeasure 1.5 tablespoons of each except cumin and throw in a bag). Can use 1 clove garlic to bring out the extra flavor. Shakshuka is one of my favorite camping meals, both backpacking and car camping. Precut everything at home. Can garnish with cilantro, green onions, avocado or whatever you feel fit like feta cheese. Lots of variations too including beans as well
"but then again she ain't missing my 0.2 picometer penis"
honestly man, I well marbled ribeye, grilled over wood fire, with a tasty beer and some peppers grilled swiftly after the steak. That shit hits the damn spot.
Second best if I've got a car camp, I used to make a badass apple cobbler in the dutch oven when I'd have friends go camping with me (they don't anymore) and that was always a hit. 
If it's a REALLY long hike though, the NextMileMeals Spaghetti and Zucchini dish can't be fuckin beat when it comes to freeze dried shit, that's incredible and I'll shill it all damn day
shut the fuck up you walking meme amerilard zoomer. everyone knows what that is
How do you store your toothbrush when you go out? Honest question. 
I really think the ultralight toothbrush handle trope started because of a dichotomy between people who were practical and boomer NPC’s who either refused to change or simply lacked the ability to do so. I don’t think it started as a way to save weight, though it’s probably that now.
30 years ago you couldn’t find pic rel. They’re ubiquitous now, but the internet didn’t exist and no one had them locally. At the time, people were starting to use lighter gear. Pack frames were disappearing, Ray Jardine had released his book, and tracking pole tents were becoming popular. 
When asked in an interview at Trail Days what he thought was the biggest change in backpacking gear over the decades, Earl Shaffer didn’t hesitate before saying “Ziploc bags.” And that’s how everyone in the 90’s was packing their toiletries. The thing is, a full size toothbrush doesn’t pack well into a quart Ziploc. So, we cut the handles. At the same time, everyone was bringing less stuff and using lighter gear.
why would you bother brushing teeth when out just wait till your back hone
discussing your reports is a bannable offense newfag. you're incredibly pretentious.
There's specifically a report option for someone announcing a report. There is not, however, an option for someone claiming to know what shakshuka is.
you can't makea fucking stew in one day
Someone's salty
Forgetting for one night is okay but any longer than 2 days without brushing is disgusting. Doesent matter if you're /out/ or not. Even if you don't eat much plaque is still an issue.
I get it just by eating too many carbs and not enough protein. I stick to lighter meals, high protein, or lower carb eating these days.
u first faggot
I don't brush Out.
After some time out you will stink anyway, so teeth is not an issue, just take a mint pill on your way back.
my_nigger.jpg
I like it simple

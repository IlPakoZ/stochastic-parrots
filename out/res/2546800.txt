post your /out/ing from a recent trip.
Who took your pic?
that looks a lot like a logging road in oregon somewhere. 
my wendigf...obviously.
not Oregon. god i hope Idaho consumes half of Oregon.
You and me both friend.
Grew up in eastern or; and greater Idaho makes so much more sense. Getting governed by Portland jr is preferable to the current situation by far.
Oregon gets worse the farther west you go. 
Love the state, despise the progressive trash ruining it by the year.
nice
Oregon has always been a story of "you have caught dysentery and died" now its just needle induced.
Wendibased
I'm gonna go /out/ this weekend so I'll post something then
is boise really that bad though
do you wear footwear to deal with solid ice on paths
Sometimes. But in this case I skied for a few miles and then bushwacked thru snow and on bison paths to get down to the river
Car camping south of Bozeman
where?
South of bozeman.
fuck off
This is near the Lewis and Clark trail in the Sula area. Skied at Lost Trail a couple days as well.
Ice climbing pictured rocks national shoreline
good shit anon, list of the gear?
Ice climbing is so crazy to me. I've heard that almost everyone who tries ice climbing only does it once or twice and then decides it's too nerve wracking. Have you had any gnarly falls?
pick one
glowing
I meant Missoula. Always get those confused.
nice. I went over there for ice fest with weird concept salomon boots and it just didnt work out. Thinking of buying a set of proclines since I like dual duty gear/gimmicks. I cant really shell out 600$ for dedicated boots. next year
Retard.
Am genuinely interested in the jacket etc, the /out/fit looks clean as fuck.
Didn't you get banned for repeated shitposting?
Fucking finally got unbanned so here's a general vista of the place
Experimented with a parallel fire lay. It's alright but the fire didn't spread towards the outer edges of the wood so I didn't get the full effect
snowshoeing
didnt you?
not been out that much lately, just a little walk up the hill in the march snow
Beautiful image.
thanks man, yours too 
I am guessing your pic is from thewestern half of north america, perhaps montana or colorado?
Was also just there, super cool.
3 nights ice fishing last weekend and 8 hours just skiing today
btw what does cross-country skiing mean where you live, i have heard that in some countries that means skiing in a forest as it is and in some countries that means solely skiing by ready made trails
its both. it means touring by ski...either on groomed trails or ungroomed trails. 
...and that anime bullshit is so fucking gay.
thank you for the proper reply anon i learned something today
when it comes to the said anime bullshit i have been laying low for 3 years until that corona outdoors trend dried down but now im back
happy trails
I know better than to camp in creek bottoms but did it anyways, it was cold af
Nice way to stay cool in the summer if you can keep the bugs out of your tent
Nevada
Any idea what type those are?
nice. not what comes to mind when I think of nevada, I usually think of desert
There's plenty of that too, man. Not a recent picture, but this is one of my favorite pictures to share.
Yeah I would like to visit a desert one day, the closest I have been is meditteranean scrubland
Keeping nature clean and preserved will never not be a noble thing.
It was a pretty weekend.
disgusting.
Fort Boggy with the Boggy Bros
tent started leaking so we left, and there was supposed to be a thunderstorm later that night too.
Compare to: 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliophorus_psittacinus
Last week I went skiing on a frozen lake.
Beautiful photo. I want to live there.
Few months ago before it snowed
Thanks. You can, if you want to live in Hurdal, Norway. 
Here's another photo. They had made these little skating tracks. Looked pretty cool.
N Idaho
WAYYYY OUT BY THE OLD KIT CARSON TRAIL
WHERE THE DESERT MEETS THE HILLS~
Real nice pics Nevadanon. Especially love >>2555132 those cozy little enclosed spots have always been my favorite. Man and with all this snow and rain, the smell of it this spring is gonna be something else.
Glad to see you out there anon
sup
Thank you, man. Got a good view of Siegel in the background while I was wandering around. I need to figure out where I want to go today.
Got my first turkey yesterday. Second hunt lol
I went out this weekend. Anyone know what this is? I tried iding it just by describing it but have had no luck
That's a mushroom I think
what make rock do this
High temperature &amp; high pressure
It's always a magical experience when you are walking through the forest and encounter a redwood towering over all the other trees
Go back you califaggot. I swear to God i will hunt you down and kill you
well yes...but no
You don't wear crocs?
ngmi
New England bros wya. I fucked up my leg on the presi traverse so im out of action for a few months. Literal torture
They look like Pleurotus so why not pick them anon?
I usually pick them by whacking them with a stick if they are too high up. Nothing beats coming home with mushrooms in early spring / winter.
Scorched earth as far as the eye can see
Fuck me, I've got to get out of this side of the country already
insecure much about your tiny penis lol
lets see yours
i dont own a gun because im not a faggot
Tiger stripe hoodies that aren't 1000000% polyester. Do they exist?
OP here. stay strapped or get clapped you absolutely amazingly retarded faggot. i live near bears and am not risking my or my dogs life because i have some notion of what being a man is. you wanna fist fight a bear? go for it dumbass
Stay strapped because mentally unhinged two legged animals are on the trail.
anyone who answers no to this is a newfag
that too anon.
I'll give a (You)
I'm from Portland and I hope greater Idaho happens because even though I'm not right wing at all, I know the Democrats are ruining this beautiful state and I want to be able to go to shoot and hunt in these great lands without some faggy fuckin cop being upset that I have a 30rd mag.
I'm in South Carolina for a few days, walked a fire road a bit yesterday and got to see some really neat stuff.
There's fire breaks everywhere, I'm not sure if they do controlled burns or just let it burn naturally in the summer but it was clearly burned recently, even the pitcher plants were burnt to the waterline. This is S. Flava, I assume
Some huge purp clusters
Gonna get a bicycle and go back out today, see if I can't do some herping and find a flytrap
Cross country skiing Tuesday April 4th.
And April 8th.
One more from that trip.
asynchronistic crystallization
Early Spring White Mountains.
getting a bit green out there
where was that taken?
Skiing in the town park, April 12th.
watch out for ghost ships brah
March 17th on Mt Whitney
Holy shit, that's amazing.
Looks cool i think
I saw this log in a tree and was wondering how it got there
Foggy this morning the higher up I got which was pretty nice
Interesting terrain. Almost looks Australian.
Randomly stumbled upon this cool abandoned military watchpost a few hours ago.
Went surfcasting with my dad this last weekend
Nice rod bro
that's awesome. scandinavia?
go in and post pics
Yeah, in Northern Norway.
The normal entrance was cemented shut sadly, but I'll think about coming back with a screwdriver and detaching the plywood covering the open window you see top left in the pic. Also the torn calendar is from year 2000 if it's hard to read.
not really a trip (hiked up to some BLM land up behind my house)
but still quite a lot of forest with no people/roads anywhere for miles. we were out for ~2 hours and didn't see a single person, the only evidence of anyone being there was this tire 15' up a tree. how it got up there, but i'm assuming beer was involved.
(inb4 leash my dog. no, that's okay, we're good. no one around = no leash)
another pic from the same hike
this might have been a logging path at some point (i'm guessing at least 50 odd years at minimum. goes on for a good 3 miles)
Tahoe from Nv side on Sunday
Desert camping is a torture fest
You killed the thread.
mfw australia will never have these trees and mountains to enjoy
Really nice, bet that place is great for mushrooms in the season.
Bigfoot probably
England's green and pleasant land.
iam new haha
Intradesting innit
First bike ride of the season and stopped by a lake that still had some ice on it.
Recent trip for some chill winter mountaineering.
You're on an anime website you filthy fucking weeb
Wollemi NP
Some dick heads fucked up their pack rafts and left them here
You will never be as comfy as this bumblebee napping on a dandelion.
10/10 would shoot
YWDS
Got to use my spikes :D
where?
Drove out to a local park this morning to throw a crab pot out and ended up having to take a shit. Luckily I had some napkins in my pocket so I popped a squat against a tree and let it loose. Unfortunately I didn't have a implements to bury my shit with so I just kicked leaves and dirt over it and went on my way.
Subhuman surface shitter
moist shit, 7/10
What's the big deal anon?
I'd love the excuse to off a brown faggot who shot at my dog, come at me nigger
The irony is palpable. It's so amazing how unhinged you dogtards are.
Its not ironic at all youre just projecting and gaslighting
Tardo mode.
YWDS
You’re telling me if you were camping in the desert you would just walk around with a bag of shit for days?
Who the fuck does that? Bury your shit like a decent person.
But what if you can’t bury it anon?
You will die soon?
Tardo mode.
Yes, youve made it very clear
So you scoop up all of your shit and walk around with it in your bag all week? Kek fucking disgusting no thanks I’ll let some fox or coyote grab it later and be done with it.
Damn wrong thread
Don't be deliberately dim, anon.
Guess I’ll keep leaving steamy piles wherever I please.
You absolutely can. I will still think you're legitimately mentally handicapped, though.
why do you expect this to go any way other than that.
lmao, delusional dogtard with no self awareness
You don’t go outside 
Explain your position then. Because in your world there’s really only two options, you can bury it or you can put it in a bag and walk around with it. So if the ground is too tough to dig, what exactly do you do? Anything other than a direct answer to this question will be an admittance of my superiority over you and forest jannies.
Did some lure fishing a few days ago
We already have an ultralighter wristlet thread. If the dirt is too tough for your fragile body to dig, then hold your shit in until you get home like the chihuahua you likely resemble
Skiing April 30th.

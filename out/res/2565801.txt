les shroud survivorman is good. He has every episode for free on YouTube and a commentary on quite a few of them.
This (Les *Stroud)
Everyone forgets about River Monsters.
A fishing show so good it ran out of content.
In one episode Ray Mears catches a fish with his bare hands. Then he lights a fire with his bare hands. Then he cooks the fish and offers a piece to his cameraman, whose presence he acknowledges. Can you be any more based?
I am watching dual survivor's 
it is sort of unrealistic how those guys sleep on the ground always like it was nothing, it is just obvious that they don't sleep in their "camps" they just go back home and film another day
Steve Wallis
Dubs of bait
yeah, about 20 years ago they released one called Saw, I'd start there.

this is a good one under the radar.
Bet you dont even stealth camp pleb
Beautiful wife magically died right around the time he had become visibility burnt out and tired of uploading content.
Nobody with standards stealth camps
based.
The original Les.
One thing I liked about the dual survivors is that the hunter actualy can get food from the woods, dude kill big animals no problem, he nows how to, hit, to shot, to set traps and how to butcher animals 
this is the most important part of all camping, food, without it you can't survive no matter what
this bulshit talk about eat ze bugs is retarded af 
if you're not eating properly you aren't able to survive that's why I liked the show so much
survivor
Isn´t that Garand Thumb? Doesn´t he exclusively do /k/ stuff, and is probably a fed?
Survivorman is a chill show
Check out this ray mears guy
All his videos are about 3 minutes long
It´s tutorial videos, not a show
No thanks
wat
At this point we should just call it a loss and make the place a penal colony again.
Just google "ray mears shows" you dried up old woman
Sounds like some savage heathen superstition thing.
Ray Mears' World of Survival
Ray Mears' Bushcraft
Wild Britain with Ray Mears
He has like 8 other shows too
Based
No he didn't can we please stop this stupid rumor, and even if he did there is know proof or strong evidence
Steve's murdery fingers typed this post
based Les Shroud. I would watch his episodes on saturday afternoons then take a nap. super comfy.
I thank all the falks /out/ for introducing me to bush tucker man
Survivorman and Alone
Not a fed and is uncancellable somehow. He replied to a thread last week about one of his recent vids and called someone a nigger for seething at him. Power level is too high
I think he's LDS and was military

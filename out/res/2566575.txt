Are bikes useful on hikes and outdoor activities? I'm planning to buy one just for transportation.
Was wondering if i could also use it for outdoor activities.
Are bikes useful on hikes
Anon, carrying a motorcycle around on a hike would be absolutely miserable, even a light 50cc.
Are bikes useful on hikes and outdoor activities?
I don´t know, try make a bow-drill fire on a motorcycle, and tell us alll about how it went.
hikes
Lol
outdoor activities
Certainly. Get a dualsport/adv bike.
Thats how grandma broke her coccyx
bikes are a much cheaper way to very remote camp sites up logging roads that usually require a decent 4x4 truck, bikepacking looks fun as shit but it requires a some experience to not fuck yourself up and dump your bike and injuring yourself in the middle of nowhere.
Bikes are fun, but 99% of riders I see out there offroad are retarded and drop their bikes on a road that a stock crossover could drive.
Why would you wrap headers on a motorcycle?
dualsport/adv
this
Surron's are fun, but not real /out/ 
They're 110 lbs, quiet, get up to 45mph, can lift over logs, but only have ~30 miles of range and take a while to charge also can't ride them on mainroads being so small.
Bikepacking is fun, but you have to go far enough away that people won't steal it, but it also requires there to be roads to that far enough away. I can guarantee if some nigger driving a truck sees your bike on the side of a road, he'll just throw it in the back of his truck and take off. It's also very easy to injure yourself going up steep hills, I've lost 2 cousins and heard countless stories of people maiming themselves on a 4-wheeler or motorbike out in the woods.
Kwab
Is that from Napoleon dynamite?
Lol yes

Love that movie!
Man i used to be a retarded kid.
A dual-sport is the only type of bike that can truly go anywhere. 70 down the highway all day; no problem. Hard off-road riding; no problem.
Take the dual-sport pill.
this. with bike you can go far, fast.
you can get way farther into the woods and farther away from the city way faster on a bike than on foot.
I'm thinking of getting one of these badboys and becoming a druid of my flat ass marshy land.
Third for a dualsport/adv. I picked up a Tenere 700 for this season, and I'm gearing up for as much dispersed camping as possible. There are a few national forests around me that I can just pick a trail and find a spot to camp in. Mosquitos will be hell this spring though... 
If you're interested in motocamping, there are plenty of youtubers that are great about doing it. I like Rob Hamilton and Dork in the Road
Get something cheap, and that runs, thats ALL stock... make it what you want it to be.. 
Gonna warn you, a small sedan is going to be better in every damn way [including maintenance cost is a huge factor] even with "fuel mileage" means fuck all when you are paying $130 dollars for semi-mat, brake pads every 8-9k miles. Ignored your chain too long? oh that's gonna cost you 160... Tires every 10ish [rear mainly] miles? 180-240 depending what you get. don't get a bike with odd ass sized tires either, do look into this before buying. this is assuming you know how to work on your shit, if you're going to take it into a shop for every little repair and install. expect $300 everytime you go for shop time...
Get a Honda Transalp XL 600 V with offroad tyres, little gay boy
Honda Transalp XL 600 V
Get something 33 years old
be a man
or be retarded. Post COVID a lot of moto warhouses shut down. 5 years ago I could get fucking brand new plastics for a 2008 GSXR from japan... now I can't even get plastics for a 2020 GSXR from japan without 6 month head time..
pls keep your Gen X midlife crisis fantasies to yourself.
How good are these for new riders, and are they uncomfortable on long highway rides? Like 5+ hours
Every bike is uncomfortable for 5+ hours anon... There isnt a stock bike thats been made in the last 25+ years I could honestly say they're 5+ hour bikes. Some come close. And some def worse then others.
The thin not so wide seat of these are gonna put pressure on your tailbone and cause lower back pain.
Anon doesn't know that the Transalp was a heavily mass-produced bike meaning that spare part are widely available, not like your Hyosung shitbike. Anon doesn't need new factory parts like a 500$ new transmission to keep his steel horse running, just used good condition used stuff. Transalp PD06 was sold in millions, your gixxer was just a wet fart in the wind. All we are is farts in the wind. Except for the Transalp. You lose, brother.
Made 15 hours nonstop from Épinal to Berlin on my Transalp on a fucked transmission. Going to replace it for 100 bucks now and recover from the ordeal
Goldwing?
I only ride on teh weekend to the local bar- the shit post edition.
Lmao- man. You're legit talking to an automotive/small engines/motorcycle/diesel/hydraulic tech/mechanic. who's currently working in the marine industry.. I know a thing or two, because I've done a thing or two. 
Millions
parts everywhere
I just looked up a brand new OEM rectifier for it
can't get it, location unknown. 
can get china parts for it tho.
assuming. lots of it too. 
went to school for HONDA/BMW/HARLEY. [btw don't waste you time going to school for that shit, dealerships suck to work at and are the only ones who actually give a fuck] 
RIP I'm the $900 blue bike above with the trailer--- and airhawk seat cover, I can do about 8 hours before I just give up for the day. Mainly the seat to peg height is not tall enough- and kills my shins.. start to feel it in the shins about the 7 hour mark. 
goldwing
1980s goldwings with the nice soft seats were fine. the new stuff the seat is still very hard. they're wide.. but still too hard for my liking. they are fine with totally custom seats.. as are most bikes with a wide saddle...
Get a KLR650. 
Untouched design for (more or less) 30 years
650cc single cylinder
known for reliability
can handle offroad decently well
can handle highway decently well
long maintenance intervals
parts super common and simple engine is easy to work on yourself
CHEAP. fairly common on craigslist sub-$3k
seriously. people have put insane miles on these touring the country/continent and there is a community of KLR owners online with a plethora of information on whatever you want to do with the bike eg. customizing it. great first bike.
Yes. Get a dual sport. I'm a fan of the TW200 personally for its dead simplicity, Suzuki DR is also a good choice.
It opens up more /out/ activities like moto camping. Also its tons of fun to just impulsively check out random dirt roads and paths that you see while driving around on your dual sport.
eh, there are just weird quality of life mods that need to be done like the doohickey and other mods that must be done post factory. plus only a 5speed, and they only started shipping EFI in 2022, everything else is carb'd. Wouldn't go that direction for a first bike
now this guy fucks. The TW200 is a fucking RIOT. It sure as shit ain't fast but damn is it fun as fuck, but shares the same problems as the KLR with only a 5 speed and a carb. It's light and very forgiving though
carbs aren't difficult and is the easiest way to get into wrenching on your own vehicle. and yeah it's a 5 speed but the price makes up for that and it can still handle the highway fine. low barrier of entry + easy platform to learn how to work on motorcycles = good first bike.
Damn if it's not heavy tho
Based TW200. I ride a DR350.
I wouldn't trade it for anything but often think of adding a XR650L or DR650 for longer trips involving highway.
I am a brand new biker myself and I would not wanna ride anything less than 500 cm3.
For safety reasons unironically
I got a hearty chuckle 
Yes they can be, its just a different type of /out/ activity, Bike camping is a real thing, and it can be really really fun too. 
It can also get really expensive really fast. 
Either way it depends on you, what you wanna do, and how you wanna do it. 
If you are around 200 lbs +- 20lbs honestly a little DRZ400 would serve you fucking well if you plan on being off road more then on the road, get a set of 20/80 tires (Thats 20% road tred 80% offroad.) and you can slap some saddle bags on it, and literally go fucking anywhere, DRZ400 will chew up anything you throw at it, just dont expect to go anywhere fast. 
If you wanna be on the road more, or are a bit bigger you can get a DR450. If you plan on riding more tame trails/logging roads, and thats it, you could get your self a bigger 650 bike that can keep up in traffic easy. 
But yes, duel sports are fucking fun, and if you live in an area that is close to the sticks/country/ BLM(That's land managements no blacks.) Its a great fun way to escape and go inna woods.
Depends on the bike, and depends on the seat, and depends on the rider. as mentioned no bike is comfortable for that long because your just gonna get saddle sore and your arms are gonna feel like they will fall off.
You can get aftermarket seats and shit to help but either way its gonna be rough, and if you are riding with a 20/80 tire its gonna be a lot rougher, and depending on the bike you get, you might only wanna stay in the slow lane.
KLR650
Honestly yeah, the KLR is solid if you are like over 200lbs, and plan on traveling on the high way a lot more. 
But the downside to the KLR650 is, you are limited on the shit you can take it through. the 650 is a heavy bitch, and you dont wanna lay that thing down loaded with gear else you will drain all your energy just picking the fucker up.
They aren't difficult, but if you're planning elevation changes, then EFI is really a must. It's definitely a welcome quality of life upgrade. If not, carbs are fine. My first bike is carb'd and I still have it, don't think I'll ever let it go (SV650)
TW200 is easy to work on. I went up one tooth on the front sprocket and can do 60-65 mph no problem.
TW200 has a weird ass battery size. 
One came into the shop to be sold. was clean AF just saw for a little bit. Owner put a chinese "rebuilt" carb on it, leaked like from 3 spots, I asked for the OEM carb and said I'd rebuild and tune it, do an oil change. and swap in a new battery for $200 even...
Rebuilt the carb- replaced a fuel line between the petcock and carb. EZ shit.. change the oil with fresh T6 [I have put t6 in my bikes for 10+ years now, from my heavy highway rider to my 300cc race bike.. its JASO MA2 Certified same shit as the motorcycle named oil you're buying off the shelf..
went to replace the battery- nowhere. NOTHING was the right sized, we probably ordered and returned like 4 battery's before I decided to do the sketchy shit and "rebuild" the existing wet battery...
Seriously. Fuck that weird sized battery. fun bikes tho.
Yeah, they're great little 2 wheeled apocalypse tractors, though do not fucking buy an '87. It was the first year they made them, they realized the entire electrical system was retarded and totally redesigned it for the '88 year and beyond. Stator, regulator and CDI are all known to fail and are fucking unobtainium. Mine has been more off the road than on it for the past couple years because of those issues.
That's weird about the battery. I'm running some no name one, Mighty Max I think, I got online for like 35 bucks with no issues. Most people now get ones that are tiny and fit them in the battery box with foam spacers. You hardly need any power to start it, I have done it with a moped battery before, and it's also the easiest bike in the world to pop start.
carbs aren't difficult
Kind of. Single carb like on the TW or DR isn't difficult. First bike I did any work on was a Suzuki GS550 which had 4 mechanical slide carbs. Huge pain in the ass, I never did get it to run right and ended up selling it for next to nothing.
Also if you do work on a carb watch out for Chinese rebuild parts. I lost months of riding time last year because I assumed the parts in the rebuild kit I bought on eBay were correct. Turns out the main jet holder didn't have nearly enough holes in it, I gave up after tons of fucking with it and put the OEM one back in and it ran fine.
I have the kickstart parts on order. I have also pop started it with little effort. The factory battery is good as long as it is over 50F out, below that and I have to keep it on a battery tender.
You ever see a naked lady
First of all fuck you.
I go innawoods to escape the noise and filth of society. You bringing your farting machine ruins that and I can hear you from so fucking far away.
I hope you don't catch a piano wire strung between 2 trees.
Fuck the bow drill, I started a fire with a spark plug and a bunch of kindling when camping with my CL125 as a kid. Don't know how easy it would be to do this on a modern bike, but I felt so fucking smart at the time.
Until I found my lighter, that is.
Under no circumstances would I recommend anyone get a KLR650. They suck dick as a road bike (burning oil above 5k rpms ~ 65mph) and suck are shitty offroad as well.
Sold my gen 2 at 75k miles, 63k from me, and would never consider buying another one.
I order carb parts that are keihin or mikuni, and floats/needles can get away with no name brand sometimes. depends on the bike. if you've taken your shit to a shop recently I was doing this kid a favor big time for the work I did and how little I charged him on labor. I should of mentioned it was $200 on labor not parts included. so probably another $22 for the oil. $35 for the carb kit. and since I rebuilt the battery only charged him for the Acid used- like $10. and whatever else I changed, fuel line or something.. The thing sat in the shop for almost 2 week because he couldn't pay right away for the work done, so it took up space and we didn't charge him for storage [normally after 3 days being done you get charged.] 
That's the issue with the battery- its a weird ass size. lol if you got the OEM wet battery keep that shit, and just dump the acid and put fresh shit in there. and charge it. only thing that makes those wet batteries go bad is Oxide on the plates- over charging and boiling the acid/water out. if you can knock the oxide off [theres a way to do this thats uber super sketchy] but I would not recommend it. 
Take battery, remove all the old acid
put fresh acid in. no water. Leave the battery "open" do not replace the plugs yet.
put the battery in a large container with some rubber pads under the battery you want an airgap 360 degrees around the battery.
fill the container up with water all the way up to just below the vent nipple on the battery.
put all this shit outside and away from everyone [seriously could catch fire...] 
hook up battery charger to battery but reverse the poles, black on red, red on black.
Maximum amps to the battery
acid will start to boil, and the oxide will be knocked off the plates.
keep an eye on the temp of the water around the battery if it gets too warm replace it with cold water.
dump the acid and oxide mixture, rinse out with distilled water real good.
put fresh acid in, 3/4 acid 1/4 water.
You can do all that work on the battery or just spend $50 and get a battery that won't leak - Amazon search: YTZ7S, GTZ7S, PTZ7S, FAYTZ7S Replacement Battery 180cca High Performance WPZ7S Sealed AGM
It will fit with the factory straps and the positive / negative fit perfectly to the cables.
unfortunately you missed the part where the battery is a weird size and I could not get one shipped in time after going thru 4 battery's that "would fit" that ended up too tall, or too wide. 
Shops order from certain vendors.. because they give you a discount. sometimes you can order from amazon if the boss sees no other option and gives you the shop card to do so.. otherwise you have to go thru the system when ordering. 
this also isn't some "work in my garage I can wait 1 week to have a battery shipped." turn and burn things, shit comes in and there was already 4 things in front of it that needed to be finished first.. didn't have time to dick with returns/trying to research the right size. Had a jeep wrangler with an 4.0 that needed a motor, fucking 16 Altima that needed a head. and a 2001 F150 that needed a transmission swapped, all in front of this TW- on-top of what ever tractor/off the highway shit you got that day..
Man what the fuck kind of place do you work? All small engine shops I am aware of are totally okay with telling the customer "Sorry bud, it needs a hard to find part and it'll take 2 weeks to come in, we'll call you when it's ready"
I would so much rather hear that as a customer and get a good modern AGM battery than some ghetto refurbishing process. It's not even that weird of a size, the parts are readily available just not commonly stocked in stores. Weird parts are shit like the stator for the 1987 TW which was only made for one year, are not available for sale anywhere anymore, and can only be rebuilt by this one shop in fucking New Hampshire that charges like 3 times what a brand new stator costs for any normal bike
If any NEW RIDER is considering picking up any older bikes listen to this anon. I made the same mistake when I was trying to get into it, finding an old non-running 82' 650 nighthawk for a couple hundred and spending so many weekends ordering shit parts and barely getting it to work with the 4 carbs. efi or 1 carb or your gonna wanna kill yourself. Wrenching is good but riding is better
Where my DR650 chads at?
DR650
Very based, they get much more capable with just a little bit of suspension work
I'm getting a KLR650 on Saturday does that count?
Im getting a Honda cb500x
Very based. I love my KLR
Based KLR gang knows. King of the value do it all motorcycles.
I was doing a little exploring and got my bike covered in concert and subsequently fucked up the electricity when washing it with the pressure washer
I meant to say covered in concrete
if you use a pressure washer, next time, leave the bike or what ever engine sit on idle [even cars and tractors] running on idle.. at least you will know where last you sprayed when it shut off- and what connectors to look at.
either give it like 2 days to dry out, or get some compressed air and start blowing out connectors. Sparkplug holes are a big one. my first gen SV- had a huge issue losing the front cylinder in the rain.[that's fun]
Not dr650 but drz400 Chad reporting in. 
I like to get deeper into the shit, single tracks, sand, mud and dirt, plus picking up a 650 more then a few times will make you wanna die.
But it's slow on the street 
I don't give a shit if I do 55 or 60 on a free way, they can pass me, I'm there for the journey not the destination
My Dream Out bike though is gonna be a pretty fucking penny. Its a KLR, but not just any KLR. I want the fucking grand puma of KLR's the most chad fucking /out/ bike ever made, it was a bike that was peak astetics, peak functionality
The mother fucking M1030M1, Or better known as the Military KLR deployed during desert storm.
This mother fucker said "What if we made a bike made for the apocalypses?" And they did it.
Able to run on JP4, JP5, JP8, Kerosene, and fucking diesel, probably bio diesel even. 
I fucking want one of these things so bad.
Tried it once.
None of the gear used for riding is useful for hiking. Riding boots walk shitty, riding jackets are armored (heavy) and too warm. You can use hiking boots for riding but offer very limited protection in the slide and no armor on the ankle and shin to protect from a footpeg or a hot exhaust also laces and shift levers love to get tangled (I wont drop my bike or fall, sure thing bud) 
You can't take a lot with, you space and weight is at a premium on the bike. 
When you walk you can't lock anything away. Maybe you have some nice lockable cases on your bike but most likely you're jacket and helmet will be in the tent.
In short your riding will be compromised with all the gear you are hogging. It will be like riding with a pillion.
Your camping will be extremely barebones (no chair, small tent, limited cooking arangement) 
My advice? Camping/hiking trips with the car. 
City and day trips with the bike.
Riding boots walk shitty, riding jackets are armored (heavy) and too warm. You can use hiking boots for riding but offer very limited protection in the slide and no armor on the ankle and shin to protect from a footpeg or a hot exhaust also laces and shift levers love to get tangled 
Yeah most boots for riding are, though you can get ADV boots which once you break them in DESU they are pretty comfy and walk fine, would you get blistered to fuck if you walked in them all day for a few days? Fuck yeah but thats not the point
Jackets if you are doing Out riding, you are not using a jacket. Those armored jackets are for like, road riding, if you are doing single track shit, all you really need for armor is helmet, knee guards, boots and thats about it, 99.99999% of the times you 'crash' are you falling over on technical crap doing like....less then 10.
You can't take a lot with, you space and weight is at a premium on the bike.
Thats not true, i can only assume then you have had bad experiences because you can easy load a bike up with a 40L pack system, not counting tank, fender and back pack, you can even edjust the shock to carry a 80L pack if you really want to. 
When you walk you can't lock anything away. Maybe you have some nice lockable cases on your bike but most likely you're jacket and helmet will be in the tent.
Same can be said about a car, which besides, the idea of going /out/ on a bike is to get WAY away from people. 
Your camping will be extremely barebones (no chair, small tent, limited cooking arrangement)
See above you can carry a LOT more then you think you can. I hike with a 40l pack and carry all the cooking equipment i need for 3days with a 2 person tent, AND a portable wood burning stove for hot camping.
Dual sports are the best beginner bikes. They're typically durable so no expensive repairs when a new rider inevitably drops it, and the engines are very controllable. The upright riding position gives good control without having to do weird contortions. The only difficult thing about them is they're relatively tall compared to other beginner bikes. Comfort is pretty bad. The seats suck but at least you aren't folded up like you would be on a sport bike.
I rode my klx300 on a ~2000 mile trip. The first half was mostly unpaved roads split over like a week. The second half was a couple days taking interstates home at 70mph. It would have been uncomfortable for the interstate portion, but it was pouring rain which made it outright miserable. 5 hours under good conditions is pretty tolerable though. 
I recommend the Japanese 250-300 class. Klx250S/300, WR250R, CRF250/300L. Stay away from the European brands until you know better.
I agree with most of this. I'm not into hiking but I camp a lot on my motorcycle trips. My big touring bike allows me to carry most of the stuff I want for camping, but even on a big bike I feel the weight and I wouldn't be able to go far off road with that bike anyway. With the small dual sport I basically have to go down to the bare minimum camping equipment.
idea of going /out/ on a bike is to get WAY away from people. 
Depends on where you are, but most public land in the US is not legal to ride outside of designated roads, which are likely to have at least a couple cars per day.
but most public land in the US is not legal to ride outside of designated roads
Ah i see you suffer from vaginitus. 
The woods are deep, and the trees are tall, the desert is long and the mountains are steep, you can rip though them and no one will be the wiser, the point of the bike camper is to fuck authority, You go up a mile long single track, no one is going to get to you except other people on bikes.
One more thing to consider is the weather. Where I live rain is common and you can spend hours waiting at a gas station when you should be riding. Riding an entire day then setting up camp in rain is going to get things a lot more damp then traveling with a car.
Good rain gear good packaging and a tent with an extra compartement for your soaked gear and coverings is a must 
I'm sure guys who like to talk about motorcycles like they're selling harley merch to the marlboro man ( >>2572706 ) like to use terms like freedom and sticking it to authority and while there is an adventures side to it there are some things to consider and expecations to be adjusted when it comes to camping with a vehicle that has certain draw backs
No it's called not being a bitch you are on two wheels and can literally go anywhere away from people if you got the right bike. Just do it.
TW200 is really a great bike for the outdoors. It has a quiet four stroke engine and a tall first gear for getting out of trouble. Only downside is it tends to get hot if you are crawling though the woods on a warm day as it's air cooled.

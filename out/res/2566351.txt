What's the best outdoor speaker to use when Im camping with my bros?
Here's your (You). Now go away.
Sage. In all fields.
I want you dead
it's b8
Choose one that fits comfortably in your butt.
X8XNWR
A gun, put it to your ear. The trigger amplifies the bass
UE Wonderboom for porn
Too heavy, feel like a pleb using it while out.
I take headphones, they are good against the wind and feel cosy late at night. I don't spook easily because there are no threats in terms of UK wildlife.

SHHHH DONT MAKE SOUND ON THIS WONDEROUS TRAIL, HOW CAN YOU EVEN CARRY THAT NOISEBOX, DO YOU EVEN ULTRALIGHT??
the chad camper
hey bro, throw us another beer and crank up the jams! nobody here but us and nature
JBL Flip
Go big anon, sound really washes out outdoors.
picrel it has convenient wheel so you can pull it on your hike
A harmonica, even if you're shit it's pretty nice just to breath in and out through it.
in clutchhh
None. 
Fuck off home and take your shitty music with you.
Okay philistine. Go seethe about music somewhere else. Man has enjoyed music for thousands of years.
Man used to take physical instruments and use actual skill to produce music. Now man listens to mumble rap at hazardous decibels.
Naw, drum circles are still a thing, and I like to listen to 'Expansions" by LLS while laying on my back staring into space. Listening to good music while camping is what it's about. Just keep it low enough so it can't be heard by other campers.
honestly if you arent showing up to the hike with rock speakers then why even come?
naw
Stopped reading there. That's as big a sign that you have nothing of value to add as saying "real talk"
You suffer from autism.
lol you got utterly btfo here >>2567410
Fake purists who never go out
Stay out for two months in the bush and listening to music chilling is awesome
JBL Clip 4 is what we use in grizzly country
hide le rock speaker just off the public trail
make it play ghost sounds at night
make em play sounds of fat people taking a shit
What a dickhead, nocturnal animals are sleeping during the day.
not blasting penis music through the forest so nature can recognize your excellent taste in music
kwab
The Barebackâ„¢ Mountain Ultimate
I forget how pathetic and autistic 90% of the anons here are.
Nothing better than getting drunk around the fire with a few good mates, toasting some sausages, drinking beers and whiskey and chatting shit whilst tunes play on the speaker. If no ones around who cares. Have sex nerds
Or you could just stay in your backyard
Or I could go out in nature as is my right and do the same thing whilst friendless losers like you impotently seethe on /out/ and do nothing
This
Be cowboy in the 19th century
Out on the road with a couple of your boys
Drinking whiskey beside the fire
Night goes on, shouting and hollering and loud music begins
Be (((you)))
Venturing outside of parents basement for first time this year after weeks of planning and kit purchases
First tentative steps innawoods
Come across group of guys who clearly come here often and are having a great time
Passing beers amongst themselves, good music on the speaker, food cooking over the fire
Quietly leave hoping no one saw you for fear of social interaction
Seethe and rage on your internet hugbox later the next day after a cold sad night of camping alone
nocturnal animals are sleeping during the day
yes and the daytime chirping starts around 5am, black woodpecker has woken me 8 days in a row now with his machinegun woodworking
almost makes me want to go sleep somewhere far away from home so maybe nature tries to tell me something
Ignore the autists ITT OP, I use an anker soundcore flare, good bass and waterproof. Perfect for those cosy nights beside the fire with bros. Pro-tip, listen to an audiobook on it whilst you lay beside the fire, some of my best memories are listening to blood meridian whilst getting shitfaced on whiskey and stargazing in the Scottish wilderness
That's a lot of projection to greentext
sundown at the national forest campground, everyone, including the animals, are going to sleep to the sound of a nearby stream
but then, a 30 foot camper pulls in
generator: ON
chainsaw: ON
TV: ON
bluetooth speaker: ON
hollering around the campfire: ON
but hey, at leas the guy shouted out "SORRY!" after he used a chainsaw to cut firewood for 10 minutes
he thinks blaring shit on a bluetooth speaker is the same as being a frontier-era cowboy
Oh no no no no
Or you could go outside. 
Bitch nigga.
choosing to camp where an RV could get to
If you're bringing your noisy electronics with you, then the backyard is as far as you should go.
Ass clown.
Bringing a speaker 
Not making your own music on the trail
t. no social life
just try to stop me faggot
This thread is another reminder why November through April is the best time of year to go outdoors.
NOOO YOU CAN'T JUST GO OUT INTO NATURE WITH YOUR BROS, GET DRUNK AND PLAY MUSIC AROUND A CAMPFIRE
God you people are pathetic.
NOOO YOU CAN'T JUST GO OUT INTO NATURE AND ENJOY IT WITHOUT BEING OBNOXIOUS, YOU HAVE TO MAKE NOISE
You could at least learn to play an instrument and play music for yourself, but you aren't happy unless you get shit-faced and use electronics to ruin the experience for people who actually enjoy /out
Any name brand speaker that is waterproof will do. Just make sure you put on delicate steve before you pack your bowl.

Nice strawman, me and a few friends can also play instruments, but it's tiring doing that all night and speakers have great sound quality these days. There are multiple ways to enjoy /out/, and desu it sounds like me and my buddies have a much better time than you do seething over imaginary normies listening to their darned music and having too much fun. The outdoors are big, there's space for everyone, grow up and go outside
be me
be cowboy in 1851
sweet gig working for some big money rancher out of texas
long day bringing two hundred head up through the panhandle
set up camp for the night, find a good chunk of mesquite for a fire, much better than buffalo chips
Ned Casey heating up the beans
Joe Smith brushing the horses
Set up the bluetooth speaker and turn on favorite juice wrld track
Ned looks up from the beans
"no cap, that shit slaps"
Joe stops brushing and nods
"bussin"
that image honestly sounds more like you
I start crying if I see a group of people drinking/playing music outdoors and have to run back to my safe little basement
Meant to reply to >>2572336
Am retard
You think frontier-era cowboys wouldn't use speakers when they got shitfaced around the fire if they were available at the time? Those kinda guys would be the people you creeps seethe over being to rowdy and not 'properly enjoying nature' from behind your computer screens
I know you are but what am I
cry more, I'm sorry loud music triggers your autistic hypersensitivity
Pretty sure the imagery of cowboys playing guitars and harmonicas is well-known. It'd be a more accurate larp if you actually played an instrument
just try to stop me faggot
The virgin speaker user fears the based woods cello player
My point was that if the autists ITT were around back then they'd be equally seething about the people they presumably idolise, because it's not really the loud music they hate, it's groups of normal people capable of socialising and having fun infringing on their autistic safe space, because they have autism/social anxiety/inceldom etc.
as a speaker user I'd love to have a friend that could play shit like that with me, best I usually get is a guitar player
Seriously though, is blasting music in nature a meme or something? I've never once encountered anyone doing this. Do you all camp at designated campgrounds and hike normie-tier social trails like the AT or something?
Kill it and then eat it.
https://youtu.be/UPu0PU6sLxo [Embed]
90% of /out/ never go outside, they just like to get angry about imaginary things
Can't speak for anyone else, but I really do just hate the loud music. I go on camps with friends and we have a great time without speakers.
People blasting music super loud is annoying sure, especially if the music is shit, but if they're in the middle of nowhere you can literally just not go near them and be fine. Also in my experience me and pals have music playing reasonably quiet so we can hear eachother talk still, don't think that's particularly egregious like people are making out ITT. They're just getting angry over strawmen
A good rule is if you can see/hear other people, you aren't /out far enough.
I went to an easy camping place last summer, and there was one of those "hiking and camping for blacks" groups. About 15 of them. Half of them had their shirts off, male and female. The women were just in sports bras with their fat bellies hanging out. I had to walk a mile past to get them out of earshot. They were up till 2 in the morning.
Nothing infuriates me more than a lazy trap beat.
maybe don't camp at a shitty public campsite/trail then retard
they were up till 2 in the morning
How do you know, you didn't bother hiking a mile away from them?
how about I camp where I want to?
Look I live in the midwest, there isn't much other than public campsite/trails. Retard. We don't have wilderness. We have cornfields. 
How do you know
Because I woke up and moved camp in the middle of the night. I figured they'd be in bed by 10.
Look I live in the midwest, there isn't much other than public campsite/trails.
Yes there is, retard. Would take absolutely minimal effort to find far more remote locations. Retard.
Because I woke up and moved camp in the middle of the night. 
Why?
I figured they'd be in bed by 10.
Well you're very retarden then. All I'm gathering from your little anecdote is how useless and pathetic you are lmao, either that or just straight up lying
Just keep it down or the wendigos will pee in your butt while you sleep
explains all the seething larpers itt
This. Speaker users stay close to normie containment zones; all you have to do is walk a while to find some peace and quiet.
One you'll be happy for the coroner to pull out of your shite pipe.

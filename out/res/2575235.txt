Your option is to become a corporate shill or become a cooperate shill.
Environmental science isn't a stand alone science--it is a fluff degree created corporations to train pseudo intellectual lackeys that don't actually know anything about science or the environment.
Park ranger, field biologist, field biologist assistant, forester, hunter, fisherman, farmer, farm worker, ranch hand, survivalist youtube man, traditional crafts from wild materials, guerilla cannabis grower (JK obey the law kids), construction worker, lineman, surveyor.
Just a few off the top of the head.
fuck, you might be right. coursework for this major is pretty broad…
god college just seems so contrived too. but i don’t know how else to get this career part of my life started. (or maybe i am too nervous to just get out of school.)
I have a cousin-in-law that fishes for a living and makes good money. I've never had a long conversation about it with him, but how the fuck is it possible? He has so many sponsors and shit that buy him a new boat every season and sends him gear all the time, and he just sells it off and makes massive bank. Meanwhile I'm working a shitty 9-5 office cuck faggot job.
Go to grad school for botany-biology or mycology and if you like it you can literally stay in school for decades doing research. Connections are more important than education but education can get you those connections.
I've yet to meet an "environmental scientist" that wasn't a government or corporate shill.
Fun fact the money a state makes on the timber and mining industries is the backbone of the state income. States like WA lie about being environmentally friendly but the timber industry basically runs the state. The state will never ever implement good policy because it would ruin their income so they hire idiots to justify timber practices and those idiots are called "environmental scientists"
WA and Oregon shouldn't ever log the lowland costal rainforests.
Most people I've talked to did their undergrad in environmental science and went into grad school for something related to their job or something they were interested in. I work for the forest service but many people in my states agency did the same thing. They are not all corporate shills lol
What kind of outdoor work do you want to do? You should be getting work experience in something you are interested in
maybe you should try tree planting. it's pretty miserable but it's definitely a humbling experience and you can make a lot of money if you go really hard. the first year maybe not but your second season is like the comeback year.
Based. Become a botany chad and spend your days planting trees, spreading seed, and spraying DPs(displaced plants)
Guess what major all of your state environmental inspectors have?
My biggest regret in life is not leaving my desk job and starting my own businesses years earlier. Pic related.

There is like this stroage space above the wall in my room and I guess there's some ventilation/hole in there because birds often come and lay eggs there. From time to time, birds come here, lay eggs, baby birds grow up, leave, the process repeats. There's like two/three nests bundled up together. 
Just a few minutes ago I saw a little birdie fren fall from there. I checked if it was okay, took it up there, gently pulled back one of the nests and saw another chick in there.
I thought they'd be cooped up inside the nest somehow but apparently the nest isn't all that much of a coop and they are kinda out, kinda inside.
I placed it all back together like they were before but now I'm worried about the baby birds.
Will the mommy birds come back and find them? Was it a good decision on my part to put it back in there? I could probably take care of it but I don't want to. As soon as this batch grows up and leaves I'll finally clear out that place and block the entrance.
But I'm worried about the baby birdies.
Will they be alright bros?
How do I prevent them from dying?

If they're pigeons or doves they just kind of do that. They suck at building nests. Let it be. There isn't much you can do even if you're prepared to raise them yourself, which is a full time job around the clock. You're a good person for caring so much about them, but don't hurt yourself with worry.

It's tiny. Something like a sparrow I think. 
I was pretty shocked to see that they weren't actually "inside" the nest. I gently pushed the nest back in its place along with the baby birds.
Is there any way to know for sure that they've been found by the mommy bird without removing the nest again?
I don't want to disturb them but am afraid they might die of stravation if the mommy bird can't get to them again. I've also placed a bag in front of the nest so they don't wander out and fall down again.

Birds rejecting their child due to human scent is a wives tale so you don't get bird AIDS and parasites.

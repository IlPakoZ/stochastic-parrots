Just grow them. Peppers are pretty easy to grow and low maintenance since no pests target them and they generally don't overgrow so no trimming either.

Let the soil dry all the way before watering it as these plants like dry soil. You have to time it right. Are you growing in the ground or in containers?

Grow chillies you actually want to eat, not meme varieties.

I grow African banana peppers as salad vegetables, Thai red for garnish and perri perri for saucing. 
Most chillies you can get frozen now very cheaply, so I grow mostly for garnish

They like heat. I can only grow them in my greenhouse in my climate.

They suck up a lot of water

Lots of water, but soil must be dry, saturation soil will cause rot/stunted peppers.
Hot direct sun, as much as possible. 
The richest lomey soil you can get, the blacker the better. Some swear by vermicompost with plenty of earth worms.

Too late, all deathly hot meme varieties will be grown this year.

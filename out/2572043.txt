Why are people so concerned with survival, all you need to have is an axe and an lighter to kill everything which is nutritious or annoy you.

Frog spammers have a mental illness and have no friends so they make bait threads to get attention.
 just report, hide, and move on

imagine you get lost in a real wood, not your wood wood, i mean beaches so thick that you can sleep on one root. and then the snow starts to fall, and all you have is a Vulcan glass stone you found on a river (cause its the sharpest stone).
and then you have to grind the old evil tree down to not die on hypothermia, while simultaneous holding the balance in its old root. but the skin of the beach is like stone.
what you guys do is a walk in a park.

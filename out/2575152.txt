What do you think of my survival spear?

Am I posting this too much online?

Would you wield it in a hunt?

It's fresh, stripped, sturdy lumber.

Monkey see, monkey do.

I learned about this survival technique.

But I improved upon it by stripping the wood and splitting the wood at the top, creating a little notch for the knife handle and making it sturdier.

Also, using duct tape instead of natural fibers. Considered using both just for aesthetics, but it'll work just fine like this.

Your spear is too crooked. Find a more straight stick.

I chose this one specifically because it has a crook in it for a handle, have tested out the weapon already and it works just fine. The center of gravity is where the handle is, which is where you grip and throw it. It's typically thrown from above, like a tree branch or blind, so gravity does a lot of the work. Lot of people down here hunt hogs with spears and I just wanted to give it a shot.

It's designed to kill hogs but it works for fish and other game as well. I use it as a walking stick, and I also use it to quickly dig fire pits. Very useful tool to have. Just wanna let other anons know that this technique is legit and costs $0, very useful. If I had some varnish, it would look even better, but that costs money and I don't have any laying around.

When you climb a mountain and stand at the summit with your spear, gazing upon the fresh and untamed wilderness, you realize that you are too a part of this wilderness.

Every single creature in the wilderness can be subdued under your control with your human-made weapons and tools, thanks to our human wisdom and cleverness.

The whole natural world can be subdued beneath our feet, but it can also destroy us if we do not respect its natural laws or take care of our environment.

I have already decided to post it on /k/ cause killing hogs is good for the environment, it feeds people. Just want to demonstrate that weapons can be used to kill and feed people, and protect the land.

If you respect nature and don't take more than you need, you are using weapons and killing for good and not for evil. They are also posting those gore videos of Ukraine like it's a video game for their amusement, so they can handle actual piggies getting killed. Just want to make a point about life and death.

Seems like a good way to lose or ruin your knife. Why not sharpen the stick with the knife and fire harden the stick tip? Then if you break it stabbing at a squirrel you can make another one?

Nice, I recommend making a chainsaw lajatang next

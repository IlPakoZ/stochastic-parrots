>airtag (for finding your bear bag or locating or campsite)
Haha wat?
--- 2574917
>>2574916
Toss an Airtag in you bear can or bear bag and if it rolls away, you can easily find it again! Pretty neat idea I came up with. It is better than using reflective tape, we aren't in the 80s any longer.
--- 2574920
Oh, can't forget a Bluetooth speaker either! Keep up the banger tunes to ward off bears!
--- 2574923

You should just home. All your electronics are already there, and a comfy bed and trendies
Gosh isnâ€™t it time for a nap?

If you use this, you'll blow out that little ember which you just struggled to get hot. Don't use these! Never blow on a fire! Your body also emits CO2 which makes you a biological basically fire extinguisher

For me its
>Anker powerbank
>Headlamp &amp; flashlight
>Probably gonna use that airtag idea
>Phone and charger
I think that's about it

Oh and a rechargable handwarmer/powerbank

Yes they're heavy, but they're great for casual camping.
And the opinions of UL fags don't matter anyways.
--- 2575022
And not really a gadget, but I always bring a sheperds sling with me.
They're great fun.
--- 2575031
>>2574983
have you ever started a fire??
--- 2575056
>>2575031
No, it was always burning, since the world's been turning.
--- 2575139
>>2575021
Is this a table? I suppose this would work well for a butane stove
>>2575022
This looks like something you could use to make a sling. I suck at knots though
--- 2575148
Flint is great to have unless you like rubbing sticks or carry metal cans of gas
--- 2575149
>>2575148


You can still make do with just sticks. You can even build your own tools in the wild.

Here is my survival spear, built it very recently, to save ammo when hunting.

You can basically rebuild primitive society as far as you can see fit.

Sometimes, I wonder.

Could we live in a new way outside the system?

I already know rednecks who live off the grid.

Could we be independent, yet parallel, to society, by severing our dependence on its infrastructure and systems?

Interesting food for thought.

It's a chair. But you could use it as a table. Or whatever.
--- 2575270
>>2574983
That's PATENTLY untrue.
>HOW MANY FIRES have I resurrected in the morning for breakfast using a blowtube...
Rhetorical.
It's in the thousands. I'm not even exaggerating.

If you ever hiked more than 3 miles, you'd be dumping useless weight any way you can, and shit like this would be the first to go.

Your bear can should be farther away from your camp than Bluetooth can reach.
--- 2575344
>>2575335
Sure, but say you put your Bluetooth tracker in a can 300ft away and walk back to camp. Then when you get hungry, walk in the general vicinity of where you left it and Bluetooth will help you zero in on it
--- 2575350
>>2575151
Theoretically yeah but that sounds like a good way to get waco'd

The original justification was for when it rolls away.
--- 2575425
>>2575412
Still applies, larger radius to look for it. I personally don't that it's so great an idea that I'm going to buy an airtag but it has merit.
--- 2575432
>>2575151
Completely? Mostly no. You'll have to work within the system and pay your property taxes, hunting permits, etc. Otherwise sure, plenty already do. It's a rough life tho.

Rebuilding primitive society with duct tape. Not picking on you anon. I get what you are saying. Just thought it was mildly amusing given the picture. Have a wonderful day and carry on.

Is there a dehumidifier tool when tenting or hammocking? The human body loses like 1L a night from exhalation and I feel we can do better than just relying on airflow... Are there rechargeable ultralight dehumidifiers? Some people also mentioned silica or charcoal to absorb condensation
--- 2575448
>>2575355
True I forgot that last time, thankfully someone else brought theirs

>highways app for heading to and from destination to be informed of road debris, construction, alternate routes, etc

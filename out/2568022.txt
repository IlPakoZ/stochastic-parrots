I didn't want to brag about it, so I didn't tell anyone. But I really wanted to say it to someone that's why I'm saying it here anonymously :3

this is a stupid thread buuuuutt sigh. handicapped people go through constant bullshit that the rest of us don't go through so I'll just say it, it's nice you helped them anon. I can leap out of bed in the morning and run to the shops and bitch about the self checkout being busy, but by the time I'm done and out the door a blind person is still going through their routine putting their shoes on or making their way to the bus stop.

I swear to god if I ever see some spoilt brat or karen or cop parking in a handicap spot I lose my shit.

This is either annoying bait and a waste of a thread or you're genuinely a gratification seeking asshole

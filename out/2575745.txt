Going here in two weeks and trying to see as much of the landscape as possible. Any recs or things to avoid?
--- 2575750
wish i had anything, all of my Icelandic side of the family died (fishing or old age) 

where exactly are you going?
guess i can only say the generic things like, if you want to try renting a car and driving around, dont press on inland without a guide
respect the gnomes
eat the sheep head 
and if you are brave, try the shark

and ayo swing by Denmark and bring me some more whale, i ran out

I tried the shark and it was alright 
The smell is offputting but the taste reminded me of those intense french soft cheeses 
7/10 would prolly eat again if it werent so expensive

Two weeks is enough to brush the surface 
Try to do a mix of seeing the big tourist attractions but also do your own exploring 
Under no circumstances should you miss hot springs / hot tubs, shits great

Oh and i forgot: waterfalls are nice, but waterfalls you have to hike for more than 20min to see are a lot nicer since there will be a lot less chinks/amerilards

ive never had fermented, only fresh, was, kinda the stereotype, of tasting a little like chicken, but firmer and maybe a little meatier? i guess, had some sort of ray too, but that tasted the same, chicken, a little meatier

grab a nice overprice wool sweater to enjoy and brag to your friends!

Rent a car and drive the Golden Circle, but go off the beaten path like anywhere /out/. I lived in Iceland as a boy but last time I went all the places easily accessible were swarming with Asian tourists. I've never done it, but one of my dad's favorite memories was taking a guided snow machine ride over a glacier. Jökulsárlón is really pretty, also very cool to watch icebergs break off the glacier if you're lucky. I personally love the beaches and tidal pools, used to stomp around them with my dad when I was little and watch seals. Puffin watching is always a good time, too. Not sure what your accommodations are, but there's a lot of cabins in the countryside you can stay at if you ever want something cozier.

Southern part from KEF to Skaftafell and a little bit more.

Going in two weeks, only gonna be there for four days sadly. Any waterfalls you recommend specifically to avoid tourists? If we are going to the touristy ones, we were gonna be quick with em and see a bunch. We are looking at doing the bigger mountains like Helka to avoid the bus crowds.
--- 2575841
>>2575779
Doing the southern coast to Skaftafell because of limited time, the longer and more strenuous the hikes the better. We were gonna sleep where we could

Well four days isnt much, so you probably will have to remain in one area of the country unless youre motivtated to spend lots of time in a car 
afaik the density of large waterfalls that are somewhat easily reached is highest in the south / south-west of the island 
Cant recommend andy specific ones, as the touristy places are still worth seeing, and other ones are less comfortable to reach or take more time
Are you going to rent a car or a van to sleep in?
I would recommend getting one of the vans, as the cabins are expensive af and you can get further away from the masses with a van

renting a car is almost a must, but remember that roads, iceland doesnt equal roads, your country.
your cute rental awd cant drive their dirtroads and when your car get washed away by a river your insurance doesnt cover it so you get buttfucked hard.

I live in Iceland. Honestly, try as you might but you will mostly not avoid tourists. 

Some cool places you might want to check out: 

> fagradalsfjall
The latest volcano to erupt on Iceland. Like 1+ hour hike to get there but it's cool

> Esjan
A mountain just outside of Reykjavik, great hiking trails, varied terrain, and you get a nice view over all of Reykjavik at the end

> Kerið
An old inactive volcano that has formed a crater. Lots of red gravel, a cool blue pool of water at the bottom, and it's (essentially) part of the golden circle

> Viðey
Island off the coast of Reykjavik. Take a 10 minute ferry and walk around on the island. Some cool history there with an abandoned fishing village

> Reykjadalur
Hot springs galore! Less populated than Geysir, and if you're keen on a short hike there are hotsprings you can bathe in too. Just go around midnight and the bathing won't be insanely busy

> Friðheimar
A greenhouse turned restaurant. They grow lots and lots of tomatoes. Tasty food. Some ways out of town, but it can still be... quite full.

But yeah, I could keep listing places. There are lots of them. If you had any specific interest in mind you can just ask.

Hey, not OP, but ill plan to stay there also for two weeks. 

I do not want to rent a car, mostly interested in nature and hiking, will plan to stay around 2 weeks, hike big distances (30+km/day) and sleep in a tent. I want to cheap out as much as i can (food, accommodation) to be able to stay and experience more. 

Currently im planning to connect some "famous/popular" hikes in the South area. But would also like to just roam around freely. Do you have any resource/recs beyond the typical things? Unfortunately i does not have any Icelandic connections.

Also early September is feasible time for the above?

Early September is probably the best time if you are optimizing for weather/crowdedness. But it can still be a crapshoot during that part of the year.

The issue with Iceland is that because the country is so small, there really is no "beyond the typical things", and that applies even moreso when you're operating near the capitol or south coast all the way to Vík. However, all nature is near unspoiled so even the touristy stuff isn't manufactured nature like Niagara Falls or Grand Canyon.

There’s near constant rain during the summer coming down from the arctic right? Momondo has round trip flights for $500, might go for a few weeks in July or August. Fly to Reykjavik, buy a bunch of food then take the buses to stash food all over then just walk across the island hut to hut and hot spring to hot spring, occasionally pushing Chinese tourists into volcanoes

I mean the summers can actually be quite dry (surprisingly so, and even come with minor drought). And rain that does come (during the summer) can easily just stick around for like 15 minutes. The real rain season is spring and fall.

my friend and I are going to sleep in the back of a hatchback, once you sleep out in a patrol base or in the woods enough the back of a cramped hatchback seems like heaven

Flying into KEF, fagradalsfjall looks like something out of LOTR. appreciate the recs, we are planning on possibly trying hvannafalshnkur if we can coordinate the guide services.

Went to Iceland last summer with some friends, and the highlight of our trip was definitely Glymer waterfall. Amazing views, and is more rugged do less tourists. Pic is near the top looking down into the valley.

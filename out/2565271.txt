What's a tough wool type for making a good sweater out of for sailing and /out/ stuff? With or without a windshell over it. My last merino got torn cuz im a dumbass and new to this. 
pic unrelated

Uniqlo heattech is S tier
Under Armour thermals are A tier
Nike Adidas Puma New Balance / sport stuff all has great long sleeves

Milwaukee M12 heated jackets are amazing for sitting still, doing nothing in the cold. Moving/ blood flow is what gets your core WARM

in order of durability:
#1 bison down (might be too expensive or hard to acquire if you aren't in america)
#2 qiviut down (internationally available, also known as musk ox down)
#3 chinese yak (by far the best budget option)

and for a synthetic option: anything made of polartec grid fleece.
it will be the dirt cheapest option by far, the most *physically* durable but it can melt easily, and not as thermally efficient or as high performant when it gets wet as the natural fibers i listed
for a budget natural option:
any old coarse (not merino) wool sweater from the thrift store as long as its thin enough and not too warm. or military surplus of one. 
or just buy slightly damaged merino sweaters from goodwill/thrift store and treat them as disposable.

Felted wool (european wool, NOT merino) probably makes for the most durable fabrics. Heavy though.
>>2565283
Might be those are even better. Felting makes for durability that no knit fabric can match though.

yep spot on. i mentioned it as the best cheap option in my follow up post just using different vernacular. 
felted sheep's wool is going to be more durable than anything on that list, which are going to be the most durable knit choices. it kind of depends what anon meant by 'sweater' which one's the most ideal, the other properties of them aren't totally interchangeable. breathable knit if he meant something like an active mid layer, and felted is best if he wanted more like an outer layer or all in one solution kinda like a softshell.

>/out/ stuff
you also kinda wanna decide if you want to use the sweater year round for /out/ stuff or if you're fine with it being a fall winter garment. if you are cool with that, i'd really consider a turtleneck type pattern.
you could always use a neck gaiter when sailing in the cold but its a pain in the ass comparatively.

don't underestimate knit bison though
this is the inside of the hand of a decade old pair that's seen many many years of trail maintanence work with hand tools. its extremely strong, but pills and sheds slowly but surely over time.

A traditional/real Irish sweater, with the lanolin all still in the wool. They're waterproof.

>with the lanolin all still in the wool
good point, if he's at sea he's going to want a fiber with lanolin.
if he's making his own sweater, its also an option to treat one of the fibers from my earlier post in its raw form before combing and spinning the yarn if he makes his own yarn. silicone lasts the longest but you can use a variety of natural waxes/oils. lanolin + sheep wool makes the most sense, since its naturally occurring, and less work. 
the whole idea of using the same sweater for sailing and general /out/ should be tossed away. op needs a much thicker type of wool for sailing than you'd want for hiking. one is high activity the other's low activity with high wind+moisture exposure. a sailing sweater could dual purpose as a winter sweater, but not really a general hiking sweater.
listen to this anon and go with a traditional irish sweater or something close to it. make sure the wool isn't processed. get another lighter sweater for hiking in. my earlier recs are great for that.

I bought my wife a qiviut scarf as a Christmas gift while I was on a trip in Alaska. I tried it on and that sucker got me HOT. I thought it was a meme, but it works great.

that's that alaskan musk ox right, i've wondered about it, heard they were really warm, are they itchy?
--- 2568185
>>2567616
It was comfortable against my face, not itchy, very thin but very warm regardless. I've held the raw qiviut as well and the hair wasn't particularly coarse from my remembering.
--- 2568190
>>2568185
cool thnx, i've been considering getting a beanie or some gloves made outta quiviut
--- 2568858
Maybe a wool lined oil skin, I didn't know they were actually designed for sailing but apparently they are.

hey dumb question do men's clothes/jackets from nz come with the zippers on the right side instead of the left? stupid question i know but i got one off of ebay and i guess it was lost in translation whether it was a men's or women's coat
either way it fits fine and seems pretty unisex anyways but the zipper on the other side is what made me wonder

I went to an op shop (thrift store) in NZ once and found a sweet pair of jeans for wicked cheap. I tested the waist around my neck and they fit. I got back to the hotel and washed them. While wearing them i had trouble putting my hands in my pocket, and my wallet sticks out the top of the back. Turns out they were women's jeans, but my wife said they made my ass look phenomenal so ive kept them

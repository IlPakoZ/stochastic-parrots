im looking for devices to maintain contact between two sites that will be a few miles apart, with a mountain in between. 
we have a large group that will be splitting into two teams. one wants to go further than the first campsite but it involves some terrain the other team isn't interested in. 
my understanding is that 2-way radios tend to struggle with these distances, especially if blocked by earth. i know there are 2-way satellite communicators as well, which seems reasonable as long as they work as advertised.
what is the right tool for this use case?
also radio general i guess

40 channel handheld CB radios. They're really your only option. Big ones like 5w minimum. I think you can get 10w ones usually called the marine version. They aren't cheap if you want 3.

this would be a solution for peak-to-peak right? im skeptical CB works valley-to-valley

This might work for you

Correct they probably won't work through a mountain.

Alternatively, radio relays.

This. Gives you a good reason to hike to the top.

have to summit to get there anyway, is it realistic to set something like that up en route? is it vulnerable to the elements?
>>2574078
About 2 miles, bird's flight. something like a 3000ft climb

Two UV-5Rs can be turned into a simple cheap repeater, there's some guides on it. Then just put it in a dry case (or in a plastic bag or something if you use a big antenna lole) and tie it up in a tree.

Satellite phone. Everything else is likely outside the scope of your project unless your building a base and network.

Just use cellphones. Stop pretending you're in a remote area.

This should do it. You can write your own calls and meanings.

Baofengs with a repeater at the top of the mountain.

Wait...
Wasn't that the entire point of horns from the get go?

Would be kinda based to use them like that...

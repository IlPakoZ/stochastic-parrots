If this actually happened to you then congratulations. You almost feel what it's like.

Personally I've almost died like 7 times and I joke about them all.
--- 2552939
>>2552923
I almost died and you think it's a good thing just because I don't use the exact same gear as you
--- 2552941
>>2552939
Not him but yeah. If you don’t have anyone else to talk to about your exciting experience maybe you should be getting some IRL friends instead of doing this on the internet.

Why? Can someone point to the rule?
--- 2553048
>>2553040
Complaining about the moderation is against the site-wide rules.
--- 2553051
>>2553040
was the image out related?
--- 2553060
>>2553040
our hot pocket eaters are retards
--- 2553061
>>2553048
Not knowing the difference between a legitimate question and a complaint is a sign of brain damage. 

>>2553051
No, it was a crying Pepe animated gif. Do all images have to be out-related?
--- 2553062
>>2553040
Yeah the janny here is relatively based and laid back but has a weird hatred of pepes and apus

Shit's funny now, and I almost NEVER make fun of people with trekking poles now, even if they're not carrying anything.

You‘re laughing

My hands hurt and you‘re laughing
--- 2557679

Fuck that sounds rough. Getting a serious injury like that while deep /out/ is one of my fears
--- 2557685
>>2553062
The jannies on /o/ and /diy/ don't give a shit about frogs. Whoever moderates here is a special kind of autistic.

Post a greentext story when you actually die. Let us know if you are allowed to fuck goats in heaven or have to suck satan's peepee in hell. Also, is god based (no trannies allowed in heaven) or not (allows bankers).

Go as fast as I can to catch up to him.
He's all dusty and tore his shirt and bounced off a Cactus.
I laughed a little but helped him up and pulled stickers off his back.
We didn't tell anybody but walked back to campground and waited for everyone else to comeback.
Good times

As long as it's fixable with first aid, you'll be ok. 
and shock is your friend if you know that it's happening and use it to your advantage to set the bone before it swells up and splint it. 

Always have an IFAK and know how to use it and you'll have nothing to fear.

Did you keep going after that? And more importantly, do you have a quick first aid kit to clean wounds like that and dress them?

>>2558136
You cared enough to have a little tantrum here in the thread. Good contribution.

What I just entered the thread you're autistic.
--- 2558172
the first time I went /out/ I didn't have proper shoes and I chickened out of a ridge that fell right off the mountain on the side. I'm still certain I had a good chance of actually dying and maybe it would've been better that way.

The /out/ jannies are extremely unbased. I was once banned for telling someone to post nose, and have been banned numerous times for "racism".

Maybe you should take the hint then. Also complaining about the janitors is against the site-wide rules.

Post nose.

maybe you should stop being such a kike, plenty of safe spaces on the internet for your kind already.

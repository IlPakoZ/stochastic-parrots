It's pretty retarded that you didn't adjust your scarf thing over the sun glass like the other side. Sane people would never do what you did and I think you owe us an apology.

The only bad bait here is OP's post. People should be embarrassed about the (lack of) quality of posts like this. It's horrific.

make your own thread, then, instead of complaining in someone elses. you probably already tried that and no one cared, so you post here hoping to shame yourself slightly less. either way, you have no self control and it's a burden on the rest of us.

I always bring a few cans with me but I'm considering packing a half rack from now on. I'll bet you pussies don't even drink beer.
--- 2564242
I bring moonshine which I refine myself from cheap wine. It's 68%. Instead of carrying 1l of beer I can just carry 200ml of my moonshine.

You should at least consider taking spirits. Fuck carrying half a gallon of beer that's only 4% or something lmao.
--- 2564250
>>2564242
Right on. Here's my thinking:
Cans of beer add a bunch of weight on the first day of a hike but like magic your pack weighs two pounds less on the second day. If I can't carry a couple extra pounds the first day I'm in bad shape. 

Beer is hydrating. If the first night is a dry camp you'd have to bring water anyway, so might as well bring beer. 

Beer has calories. Instead of eating a sugary snack, drink beer. 

Beer requires no mixer. Yes I know spirits technically don't require a mixer but even good bourbon likes a splash of spring water. 

I have a question for you. When you distill wine, what percentage is heads and tails? I've done a few runs of corn liquor and had enough trouble that I'd like to do a wine distill.

>>2564241 (OP)
I prefer spirits. Usually pre-mixed into a cocktail of some kind at home and carried in a thermos. Beer is too little alcohol for the weight imo.

I'll sometimes bring a beer or two on a day hike, or a few if we're car camping though.

Okay you guys are faggots and beer/whiskey hangovers suck so here is my recipe for good booze to be /out/ with.
1l spirit 95%
2l vodka 40%
1kg plums (without the seeds)
0,5kg sugar (or more, depends on the taste, can be replaced with honey)
Mix that shit and let it stay in a big jar for a month. Shake it every other day. After a month it's ready but remember that it only gets better with time. We don't want seeds due to cyanide that may appear after some time. Cheap, tastes heavenly and almost no hangover after that. Ration it according to your needs. It's an old Polish recipe.

Based. I went from drinking 3 - 4 24 packs per week with a bottle of whiskey all through my early 20's to quitting cold turkey. Almost 30 now, and I can enjoy a social beer or two without desiring to get shit faced. Haven't had a buzz on in years and I dont even miss it. I look back on those years in disgust and shame

Yeah is does suck because sometimes you need mixers, but you dont need to get the highest proof stuff out there, some crown flavors can be sipped straight with very little bad taste at all

A good Wodka is perfect, high alcohol content, wont freeze, tastes good when unmixed, but can also be used in combination with almost anything.
Also only beer that has been brewed in Czechia, Poland, Slovakia, eastern parts of Germany is accepteble, everything else is sugary pisswater.

Can moonshine be used to disinfect water in a pinch? What's the ratio of alcohol to water needed to prevent waterborne illness?
--- 2567424
>>2567421
I'm sure somebody figured that out but in the grand scheme of things it's not something you should rely upon because there are so many other ways to treat water. Save your liver for good beer, bourbon, tequila, etc.

Not really. You need more than 10% ethanol to have any significant antiseptic effect (and even then it's pretty minimal). At that point the alcohol is going to dehydrate you more than the water can offset.

The 5-liter Heineken Draft Keg is the perfect size for a day-hike.
--- 2568265
>>2564241 (OP)
Anything over 2 drinks per night is over the limit.
--- 2568321
>>2568247
Yeah but it's Heineken.
--- 2568333
>>2568265
While you're correct about the nightly limit you didn't quite answer the question. I posit that three beers is insufficient for a typical pack trip, but if you were on a seven day pack trip, even two beers per night would mean carrying a 12-pack (the seventh night usually being spent at home). If the pack trip was a simple three mile hike to a camp where you'll be staying until you return home, this is doable. Otherwise, one might be forced to stage loads of beer or use porters for a lengthy trip, mountaineering style.

Between my brother and I we typically have a full case of Leinenkugels Original day 1, and by day 3, it’s just a couple oz of aluminum in the trash sack and it’s whisky time. I like Redbreast Irish whisky, and we bring it in a couple of Stanley flasks
I don’t tend to drink when I’m hiking without him. I think it’s because when I hiking without him, I generally can’t depend on other people to drink and carry their own weight or drink and not become a mess in camp.

Not being able to understand bringing alcohol on a hike is pissbaby tier, not being able to hike without drinking is dependent little bitch tier.

I used to hide kegs in the forest. I would leave a guard in the area just in case someone else came along... The third time I did this the guard got so drunk he fell out of a tree after 9 hours of day drinking waiting for everyone to show up... so I had to stop.

Its good beer if you enjoy peeing and want to drink a six pack just to get buzzed.

Based. I usually bring a flask of whiskey with me and sometimes a single 12oz to-go of wine you can find at a liqour store.
Not a big wine drinker, but it hits really well when I cook up some camping pasta for dinner. Makes it feel more like a complete meal. 
Otherwise yeah, usually a flask and then a 24oz beer for chilling by the fire. Even better if it's hot out and you find a cold stream to chill the beer in while you're out hiking. Coming back for a cold beer in 90+ degree heat is amazing.

Just recently walked 800 miles with my buddy who’s a drinker. Every town was a 12 rack of 7% ABV craft beer. He’d drink them all that day, usually getting in at least 24 every town. He can be drunk and still maintain a 3.5mph pace. But it just gets ridiculous when you start doing dumb shit because you’re drunk. Running through water crossings, getting blisters, getting lost, losing your things. Plus you’re hungover the next day. I like to drink beer at the end of a trip or end of a day, feels better and doesn’t interfere with my plans

Beer is estrogenic, makes you drowsy, gives you a headache, dehydrates you, and lowers your IQ. Why would anyone ever drink it? Beer consumption and masculinity are direct opposites; the least masculine cultures consume the most and the most masculine cultures consume the least. Beer is nothing but pure, useless, worthless poison that no one would ever consume if the better stuff wasn't illegal.

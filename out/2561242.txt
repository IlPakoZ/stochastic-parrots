I've seen a few posts and videos about digging burrows or underground "habitats"/foxholes/living spaces, and I'd really like to make my own.
I remember a breif /k/ thread on the subject, but I think I'd get more on-topic and informative posts here. Preferably making a space I can sleep in and expand in future.
I'm trying to remember a few suggestions I had heard; I think it was digging soon after rain fall was better, and so on. 
Any suggestions and material are welcome.

We used to have MGTOWUG threads about guys that wanted to excape from women by living underground and raising goats

I should try and find those, might prove useful, apart from the escaping women part. I'd still like to talk to femoids on the odd occasion.

Search for dugout cabin on YouTube. Stick 
 with something like that. Tunnels can get you killed if you don't know what you're doing.

In the event that your headlamp dies, the glow coming off this PDF can provide more than enough light to navigate safely under almost any conditions.

you will be much happier with the goats , they dont hate you just for being short

The authentic version is a shitty hole in the ground. You can do better anon, give Saddam a hole worth hiding in.
--- 2562178
Depends on the soil. Also do not listen to the whispers that tell you to dig deeper and abandon the overworld.

It's a lot harder than you think. Easier would be finding 2 downed trees parallel of each other, cutting old branches to size of roof and mudding it

He was issued a cease and desist for posting images of his bunker online since his countryâ€™s government had other bunkers with the same layout. Pretty sure he still posts on /diy/ sometimes but has not posted a new picture in years due to legal stuff.

He is the lonely shepherd of the tunnels.

Tending to his meager flock and his redneck ways.

To harvest the mohair, to raise the goat meat and goat milk for market.

To live on the land, to feed and clothe the people, in harmony with nature.

OP, I am glad you asked about the tunnels.

It is certainly one of my favorite subjects, hidden underground shelters.

Something about the tunnels just stirs the dark corners of the imagination, there are so many possibilities for what you can build. Of course you have a water source, shelter to sleep in, weapons, ammunition, food and equipment to cook it. The Viet Cong tunnels are now an actual tourist attraction, they are a part of history, these are 1960s tier guerilla tunnels.

But this ain't the 1960s and the Viet Cong are old boomers now. This is now fundamental, it can be expanded upon, especially in a first world nation. You can have cheap solar panels hooked up to car batteries and 4G dongles, giving you electricity, internet, computers/phones/tablets. These electronic devices include cameras which can monitor your tunnels and even monitor the above ground areas from underground. You can browse 4chan and grill fresh caught salmon on an electric hot plate.

There is something about the underground that is just comforting, like a natural womb. Hidden from aerial surveillance, safe from aerial bombing and napalm, from the eyes of drones and drone strikes, from quadrotors and UAVs, from thermal sensors and night vision goggles. Hidden even from the deer, which makes pit blinds and underground shelters great for hunting from. Great for stealth camping as well.

However, in Appalachia, where I live, there are literally over three thousand caves in just a single neighboring county alone. Caves may not have hidden entrances, but you can tarp/bushcraft the entrance to hide it. They are natural tunnels that provide all the same benefits, but you don't have to dig them. If you live on flat land, like the Vietnamese jungle flats, it makes more sense to dig underground tunnels. Well, the Viet Cong also had the mountains and caves. In Vietnam, they have Han Song Doong, the largest cave in the world. So don't discount caves as a natural pairing to tunnels.

What is the purpose of a guerilla tunnels?

It is to conceal, protect, transport, arm, supply, shelter, organize, and command guerillas.

A functional guerilla base can provide guerillas with tactical cover and shelter that is safe from aerial attack or detection. It is also a place to eat and drink water, to be armed and supplied ammunition, to receive medial treatment, to receive orders, and to carry out surveillance.

The concealment of the mountains, plainclothes, and natural tree cover is enough to keep a guerilla hidden and safe from detection. To make eradication of insurgents realistically insurmountable. It is an enemy that you cannot even see or discern from the civilian population, formless and shapeless like water. In areas without tree cover or higher elevated ground, you can still build tunnels with hidden entrances. It is pretty straightforward in an open prairie.

However, a modern 21st century guerilla tunnel in the USA would have great possibilities, for the willing architects and digging enthusiasts. For one, we have power tools and digging equipment, making the digging process much faster using gasoline and electricity. We have cheap solar panels finally, batteries, advanced rifles, water purification, smartphones and laptops, camping gear.

The basic principle is still the same, and it still works, but we can build even better tunnels now. High tech tunnels, cozy tunnels, American tunnels for American guerillas.

That dude in a narrow passageway? He's 3m tall.
What's your excuse for not going through one right now, manlet?
I semi-recently heard of a guy who would just fucking dig from his basement, for 0 reson and with 0 plan but if you want to have something more structuraly sound there's a thread on doomsday bunkers on /diy/ right now.

Plenty of windows for sunlight and ventilation. It's not a basement, it's an underground home.

The house is dug out of a slope. If you think of the "front" of the house as the downhill direction, then there's no front door or windows, but you dig out a back courtyard and side doors and windows. Guy had more problems with bears than mold.

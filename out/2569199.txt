I've been munching on some kind of mustard that's growing around here. Very tasty. Also red dock which is super tangy and delish but it has a lot of oxalic acid so only a few nibbles here and there. Waiting for the cattails to start growing again, prolly in a week.

Most rural areas on the west coast US have mushroom clubs that meet every few months to go on walks. Foraging plants is usually much safer than foraging mushrooms...

desu if you don't know how to fish and/or hunt consistently in the woods you'll die of hunger if you're trying to survive ...

That simply isn't true. It really is just dependent on the available flora and fauna in our areas.

>>2569214
>garlic mustard is nice
yummy in my tummy
i mix the chopped leafs into my rice and cook the stems like asparagus

I wanna get into it and I bought a couple books but shoots and leaves haven't even started showing up yet :(
--- 2571528

All those leafs are edible. They used to make pesto out of it. Taste is like a mix of garlic and aftershave.
--- 2572142
Got some dryads saddle the other day
--- 2572185
>>2569199 (OP)
Found some Morels the other day. Plus a shitload of wild garlic and I've been eating the shoots of wild hops while foraging.
Here's a recipe for a super easy and creamy sauce I like to make.
>grate a zucchini
>chop a handful of wild garlic into fine pieces
>cook with a little water for about 10-15 minutes
>add sour cream to your liking
>season with salt and pepper
>thicken with white flour if needed
Tastes best served with grilled chicken or fish.

Is it still morel season, and can you find morels in pine forest if there is still stuff like skunk cabbage in the area?
--- 2572216
>>2572190
>Is it still morel season
Yes but high season is nearing its end. You can still find them in May but it depends on how moist it is.
>can you find morels in pine forests
Probably but I'm not sure. Found mine near maples. If you know any places with ash trees, it's always worth looking there.
>if there is still stuff like skunk cabbage in the area?
That doesn't grow where I live so I can't tell you.

And a patch of what I think are black raspberries. Found it late last year so we'll have to see what the fruit is like, but the bluish-white powder on the cane is fairly solid evidence.
--- 2572344
i will be gathering some mushrooms this year again and i made this handy image so everyone can check their findings before calling me a murderer

>>2572216
I just walked around a cedar-maple swamp for an hour and found nothing. It isn't fair.
--- 2573893
Is this a rubus species? I was thinking dewberry, but I'm not sure.
--- 2573916
>>2573893
Fragaria Chiloensis
In the rose family but commonly known as a Strawberry.
--- 2574141
>>2569199 (OP)
I don't think there is anything to forage i. Wyoming.
--- 2574443
>>2574141
Get the book "foraging the mountain west" by Tom Elpel
--- 2575426
>>2573893
Basically everything in the genus Rubus will have thorny, woody canes--much like a rose--unless you find some cultivar or wild mutant without thorns. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, cloudberry being one I can think of off the top of my head, but most species will fit that bill. I'll agree with >>2573916 that it is a strawberry of some sort. Don't know about exact species, since that would depend in part on where you are in the world.

Fragaria Vesca is the other species of strawberry native to the USA that looks like that. I was making an educated guess.
Europe imported their wild strawberries from the USA although some claim they used to have a variety from the romans... I really can't substantiate that though. Strawberries weren't popular until white flower became affordable to the middle class around 1900 when milling improved enough to make white flower cheap--and that's when pastry making exploded and Americans started pimping strawberries (and cultivating them in earnest).

Thankyou for attending my ted talk.

Do you mean Fragaria virginiana? Cursory reading on wikipedia seems to suggest that F. vesca is native across the northern hemisphere, although I'm by no means a strawberry expert. It does also cite, albeit somewhat poorly, that the word strawberry is attested in Old English, which would suggest that Europe had some kind of native strawberry, since the Old English/Middle English transition is around 1066.

>>2575738
>didn't you mean this variety
in a way I kinda did...
They seem to be the same all but in name and 100ish years of acclimatization to europe.
Berries didn't matter to rich people in antiquity because poor people had better access to them. When white flower (highly refined with shit nutrients but hard to make prior to the 1900s) changed all that.
Weirdly enough if you accept strawberries are unique to the America's than it makes it obvious proto Europeans visited America long before public history admits.

Lucky, mine haven't grown yet. I'm thinking about picking as many as I can this year, bagging them up and freezing them so I can make jam throughout the year.

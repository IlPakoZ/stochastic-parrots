i have one, they are worth it for peace of mind. the only problem is i live in the PNW and heavy tree cover completely kills it.

Which subscription do you use? Did you get any of the map packs/are they useful?
--- 2538697
>>2538640
i bought a inreach mini, its not really a GPS. just use the basic plan. tethering it to your phone lets you quickly type messages/SOS and check weather which is all i need. I just use my phone as a GPS. unless you spend a ton of money(+700 dollars plus) the GPS ability on these devices is fucking terrible. The unit in the OP photo legitimately had the worst feature set id ever seen, i believe its been discontinued now but it didnt even have topography or trail maps. it just had basic outline of the geography and water so it was basically useless. 

the only real downside of this is that your phone consumes battery at a much higher rate than these dedicated GPS handhelds but i carry multiple 18650s since my headlamp also uses that same battery.

 The iPhone 14 comes with a data plan that includes PLB functionality for a year or two, then you have to pay for it as an added feature or something. So I guess all of the newest phones will have it soon, or already do, and PLB’s will probably die out.

It’s a personal locator beacon, Anon. It’s not just a GPS. These have basic satellite communication, not just reception. They can send a message if you’re lost or injured. That message is received by a service and relayed to the appropriate officials who can launch a search or whatever.

a phone will totallly mog every single GPS made nowadays, they are horribly behind the times with tech. They have terrible laggy interfaces. The only upside is if you need to access the device with gloves since tend to focus on physical button navigation. 

>>2538705
there is caveats to the iphone SOS system, it cant be used for texting and weather updates like garmin products but if youre in the market for a new phone its probably a good way to get 2 birds with one stone. 

>>2538712
unless you are a 80 IQ idiot using google maps for navigation then this is not an issue. any good GPS software for a cellphone is going to have the ability to store maps on the device. I keep the entire of north america maps on my phone+any layers i need on my phone. It chews up a couple gigs of storage on my phone but whatever.

I always have a handheld GPS and a PLB when I'm /out/. I will sometimes bring an inReach to stay in touch with friends and family.
Whenever I'm hunting (or going /out/ at all), I have five rules: 
Safety, safety, safety, safety, safety. 

Shamelessly borrowed from Jim Shockey, but that doesn't change the validity of the sentiment. Being prepared never hurt anybody, lack of preparedness certainly has. You have to ask yourself what you what is more important:
Being called a wimp on the internet by some rando who probably never goes /out/, or not ending up dead in the wilderness because something happened and you had no way to call for help. For me, the latter is far more important.
That doesn't mean living in fear or never taking risks. Just don't talk yourself out of taking logical safety precautions either due to peer pressure or money.

1. GPS units are significantly more durable than phones. They are better at standing up to impacts and have much better weather resistance.
2. The battery lasts longer; and if you use a unit that takes removable batteries, you can easily replace them.
3. They have more features for navigation.
4. Not everywhere has mobile phone reception.

>durability and waterproof was
This could be a concern, but it’s never been an issue for me. I hiked all of the Pinhoti and roughly 3/4 of the Florida trail with an iPhone 7 (back before all of the smartphones were waterproof to some degree). 
>battery life
If you’re going for an ultralight base weight or are just weight conscious this is definitely a concern. If you’re taking both a phone and a GPS, then you’re obviously not too concerned with weight. 
>more features
Like what? Phone apps are as feature-heavy as the designers want them to be. I find that most have too many features.

I haven't found this to be the case at all in the north cascades even in rain and heavy cloud cover... do you mean it kills the gps and text, or just live voice calls?

Only ever bother with gps and text, maybe latency would fuck up audio. 

Or are you in like the Hoh forest or somewhere even denser?
--- 2540710
>>2538633
I remember reading this post, I now keep my gps device in a zippered pocket of my pack which actually delays the time it takes to send and receive messages (yes, i've tested it and it is actually slower to having it clipped to your strap); and, while that's not really a major problem when you're /out/ing it in familiar woods, it does pose a threat when out on multi-day ventures or unfamiliar terrain where sending a message within minutes as opposed to after 10-20 minutes, where whomever you're messaging could look away, become distracted, leave their phone, and end up seeing your cry for help many minutes/hours later.
tl;dr I don't give a shit if I or you or anybody has their gps device hooked to the outside of their pack/person, it's probably the best practice for preserving their life despite any appeals to the contrary.

IEEE tested this. The conclusion is cellphone GPS reliability varies greatly even between the same phones. 

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7876317

GPS accuracy isn't tested on cellphones before they ship--they just run a hardware test. 

The real test: if you need anything other than a grid location from a GPS you lack the basic skillsets required to navigate and shouldn't leave trails or roads.

Thank you. Too many people have zero orientation skills. Like what is a compass tier rookies and they won't even try to learn.
I've tried sherpaing this sort before and they just ignore me and check their amazing GPS app they're fond of, because why not come 5hrs to be with nature so you can play with your phone half the time.
I can pinpoint within 5m spots on others' trip videos remotely without compass readings, assuming there's landmarks obv. Its a fun game if you're bored. I could teach a lot, but rarely does anyone care yo learn. Depressing a tad.
I will use GPS on the rare instance I'm turned around in thick featureless woods, thats about it, or to double check a trail junction in same.

I’m on the fence about this unit. It has “in reach” non emergency texting and emergency beacon with 2 way com. Also replace my seperate dog training collar, and my gps (phone does not work where I hunt at all). It’s almost 1500 with 2 collars but I really am thinking about it. The only downside is you can’t use it to make a virtual electric fence, you can make a boundary line that alerts you if the dog leaves but it won’t auto-shock them like some of the other brands. Upside is everything else. Never owned a Garmin anything but they seem well built
--- 2545179
>>2545162
I have an older model I use on two huskies. Its great. Geo fence is hands on, thats all. When it beeps, you manually correct. Just keep the unit by you while training. A smart dog learns pretty quick. Also it has hella range. Easily 5 miles here in a very heavily wooded area of hilly terrain. Great battery life. Half a day on the handheld, day plus on the collar depending on setup. Less transmitting means longer life. The only downside Ive found is map sucks, as in it only shows terrain zoomed out to like an inch equals a mile. It can get you places, but dont expect it to show the terrain or trails. Theres also a lighter/smaller collar for smaller dogs.

I assume the posted version has added inreach features?

i just have a unit that can do only text/weather report but it does have gps. 

tree cover makes it difficult for these iridium devices to communicate, in the PNW its so thick i cant get a signal. I will run the diagnostics on the unit under a variety of tree cover and it has to be pretty thin for it to work. 

GPS is received via a different antenna on a 1 way signal on a band that is not hindered by tree cover too much.

The entire world was explored with maps and a compass. I might think about buying one if I was going somewhere notorious for hikers getting lost like the area around the AT or that forest in Australia where people always get lost and die. I live in a place with a lot of Identifiable mountains and rivers so I don't have any need for one. I'm generally pretty confused when I see people hiking popular trails with them. I also notice that a lot of the stories I read about hikers who get in over their heads and die (like that banker woman in NH) they have a PLB with them. If I were to get mauled by a bear or fall and break my leg I would prefer to die like a man.

those sorts of GPS units (like Foretrex too although that's even more basic) are really designed to be used with a physical topo map. They're just good for getting your exact location and orienting you to a point or following a route but not for route planning or looking at your surrounding area. The ones with digital topo maps are nice but generally cost a shit ton more and it means if the thing dies or breaks then you don't have maps at all (same with a phone, carry a physical map and compass too for god's sake anons, it's a few hundred extra grams).

the battery lasts twice as long and it tracks more accurately at speed when it's oriented properly. If I keep it in my backpack the battery dies from constantly searching for maps and re-orienting.

They're only worth it if you go in areas that are bumfuck nowhere. If you're hiking the AT, and you're not retarded enough to get lost, someone's going to stumble upon you before you die, probably. If you're in Bumfuck WV, hiking near the NRQZ, a broken leg is almost a death sentence. I've been in National Forest areas that I haven't seen other people in over a week, and that's in the spring. As modern tech bullshit as it is, bring your phone, bring an external battery, and bring an SOS system if you're going somewhere that others aren't. And for god's sake, get the insurance if you aren't on public land.

Celltards don't understand that the accuracy of Cellphone GPS is significantly improved by tower triangulation augmentation and so, when you go out of network, cellphone location accuracy drops significantly.
99% of cellphones use the cheapest GPS receiver-hardware possible because they know most users will use the augmented accuracy from the towers. 
ALL advertised cellphone location accuracies are based on A-GPS not stand-alone GPS. Celltards always lie about this.

I'm looking at getting a GPSMap this year. The subs seem worth it, since you can do month-to-month and avoid wasting money on it when you don't need it.

Oh I was thinking you said you couldn't get a GPS signal (receiving only) - you mean a communications signal (broadcast is needed). 

That kinda makes sense. 

Makes me think I should actually test the broadcast case - I assumed that if GPS was working the communication out would be fine... 

>>2549608
>I don't know why these idiots need a GPS for day hikes, though, I only bring one to places where I would actually need one in an emergency.
I lately bring mine on a ton of even easy/well traveled hikes. Mostly since I already bothered to buy it, so I might as well use it and learn it well. Better to be prepared than not, etc etc. I also over pack water and a filter, just too many years of boy scouts ingrained it in me. 

 
Plus metrics tracking (speed but mostly vertical gain) is interesting to know. 

Good way to shake-down test your gear - I didn't realize until an easy hike that battery will significantly discharge over a few weeks if left off in a cold garage - now I know to top it off overnight before trip, vs just trying to top it off on car charger during drive out to trailhead. Much happier having that learning on a pedestrian hike than a real trip. 

>>2549700
>I don't think GPS will even be useful in places like k2
eh, if you can geo fence your expected route, and have it beep at if you leave route, it might help you correct if you start to fuck up your route due to impaired decision making from low oxygen or start of hypothermia, or just some kind of panic.

Not him but I'm also in the PNW. The GPS satellites are transmit only, there are more of them, and they are in a higher orbit than the Iridium. Even on shit days I have around 9 GPS satellites "visible" 
The communications goes through iridium and only connects to one Satallite at a time...it's more like a cell service but the towers move instead of the phone.

The company that I work for purchased Garmin GPSMap 66i's to replace our aging stock of 64s' and DeLorme inreaches and I must say that although having a two in one package is nice we've run into some problems. Namely the fact that you cannot swap batteries on the 66i. We had several instances of 66i's die on our guys in the field due to the cold (also because they left it in 10 minute tracking mode) and other than a battery bank they have no way to charge them. 

Personally the 66i has been good to me, but I also know how to use the device and how to keep it functioning, we dont always get the brightest guys sampling for us.

The irony is Iphone is 2000s tech that people pay double market price for because of the brand name and superficial features.
Hint AM. 721-00051-A is the same, tired, regurgitation of a 90s garmin reciever for 10x the price.

>TMW you realize that the guy trolling the thread isn't actually an insufferable faggot supporting Garmin, but is instead an Apple employee trying to turn people away from handheld GPS devices by spamming pretentious ad hominem
Well played, applefag. You almost had me convinced to stay away from GPS devices altogether.

if you want it as a life saving device it's fine. I reach mini has other features but also costs money for a subscription

Galileo and beidou were not available on smartphones in 2009 so things have definitely changed since then. I'm not the guy you're arguing with so don't reee at me

I look like this.

I scuba dive and use an inreach mini 2. Granted the thing does NOT work underwater, I figure any casualty underwater while scuba diving is fatal if you can't recover and two if I'm fucked up at the surface or sweapted out to sea I have an emergency means of batphoning home as PLB. Worse case at least my family has a corpse they can recover.
Also yeah the inreach systems are primarily a PLB they have GPS but that just a standard feature in any PLB made in the last decade.

Also if you want to use it on a plant carrier or any MOLLE webbing you have to get a chain of adapters which imo is fuckin high kikery from Garmin. For me with the underwater case it was underwater case > back clip>slide>MOLLE adapter all separate accessories.
U/W Case and molle adapter

On the internet you're homosexual &amp; pussy for bringing a parachute to parachute jumping.

While out of the pod nobody ever called me gay or pussy for wearing or using any and every sport related gear or even gimmick.
In fact only ever received mires of my cycle helm when cycling, slim speedos during swimming, walking poles when hiking etc.
--- 2562110
>>2562100
That should tell you people are dishonest irl
--- 2562112
>>2562110
It takes courage to leave the pod and that's the fear being projected on the internet.
It's too obvious on this board when all of it comes from people that clearly never go out.
It's like when the internet dwellers join irl, they overcome those fears.

I've been tempted to buy one of these handheld GPS devices for years. Aside from being able to send an SOS in an emergency, having a GPS for navigation sounds super convenient. I've tried using GPS apps like AllTrails/Gaia but they just don't seem to work well on my S10e and I ended up going back to just consulting a map when needed. 

The problem is that Garmin just seems like one of those niche companies that lack competition. They're still relying on the MIPS architecture which is close to 40 years old and slow as fuck, and they're charging a lot of money for it. And they get away with it because basically nobody else is making handheld GPS devices. I'm conflicted.

if I wanted a dedicated GPS unit , I'd get a cheap "tough" smartphone off AliExpress, put OSMTrack / OsmAnd+ on it, and disable everything else that might possibly drain the battery

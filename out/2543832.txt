Turns out you can buy land in colorado for 1000 bucks an acre.
We could farm in the summer and drive semi trucks in the winters for income

Land is getting cheaper for those that have cash. 

If we all bought 5 acre lots in this huge subdivision , we could be far enough away from each other that we have our own space while still being able to do barn raisings and such 
Should we finally just do this?

>>2543832 (OP)
If you could grow anything on that land, it wouldn't be $1000 an acre. There's a reason its fucking worthless. For that price, it isn't going to have any water and also isn't going to berth a fuck for ranching.

with that low of a price, there's a reason. They're usually meant for you to camp on to hunt as far as I'm aware. Probably no access to water or power, so you're going to need to drill for water access just to have a well, you're going to need a well house and a pump and everything, but for that you need power. You're probably going to be way too far out to gain access unless you buy a bunch of solar. Okay, so you need the paneling to power not only your house, but your water pump as well. You need the storage bank for the solar, and with how little it rains you're going to need a lot of solar for not just to power the house and the water pump, but now you have to use irrigation for your crops. If I were you, I'd just get something a little less out in BFE because it'd end up being just as much. not to mention if you don't choose to drill a well, and go with water delivery instead, you're going to need a lot for not only whoever's living with you but for your crops as well, livestock, whatever.

A buddy of mine did this 3 years ago. Bought an acre for a few thou outside of Moffat in the San Louis Valley. He parked a school bus on it and lived like a refugee, hauling water from 5 miles away, driving 20 miles into Salida to get groceries from Walmart. He finally realized the error of his ways and sold everything at a loss. Colorado is full of these stories. Unless you have the money to build a house (even if it's a shack) and outfit it with a large enough solar system to run a well (which averages $10k to dig) and keep a vehicle maintained (and have the money to buy another vehicle when that one dies) and pay the property tax and buy food and pay for random medical expenses and buy everything else you need as time goes by, this particular lifestyle is a slow drain on your finances and mental health. I have the cash to buy 5 or 10 acres of land in BFE but after adding up everything I'll need over the years I know it'll kill me in the end. Unfortunately it takes some kind of income to live, and scratching it out on hardscrabble won't work. I've lived in some remote parts of Colorado in log cabins, trailers, and assorted tents and teepees, but the only way I could do it is by working my ass off on various construction jobs or at resorts, which meant having a 4wd vehicle in good shape. "Living the dream" is a euphemism for busting your ass in order to live in the mountains. It's a young man's lifestyle and unless you start a business you'll end up broke.

--- 2544785
Solar is pretty cheap these days
Used panels go for like five cents a watt
Everyone is upgrading batteries so used ones are cheap as well 
A well pump does not use that much electricity anyway and can be run only in the daytime
Southern Colorado is probably the best place for solar in the united states with 3oo days of sunshine but it does not get very hot 
Passive solar homes only need heat on cloudy days and that can be done with a wood stove 
In the winter there is a trucking company that will hire us for 1500 dollars a week each, but we need CDLs and will only be home one day a week during that time

"Maladaptive daydreaming (MD) defines excessive use of fantasy which replaces human interaction and/or interferes with academic, interpersonal, or vocational functioning. This study tests psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Maladaptive Daydreaming "
so if it's interpersonal, and productive toward the self, as such is my relationship with God and my dreams respectively, it isn't maladaptive, but, I think you're just sort of a nihilist about starting over cause you know the owner of the world is satan, BUT, remember the Love between you and God, and then the love between others, that is why you are in this world. That's it. The rest is satan, and iniquity. (not saying I'm good at practicing this either). Plus, it does say, take care of the land, so, whatever land or community you're in, take care of it.

You still need the well drilled, casing installed, etc. You arent hand drilling 100' of bedrock. Shallow wells access the water on top of bedrock, and really only work in certain soils, mainly sand.

Windmills are still shallow wells. 

Point is you cant assume its going to work. I have the correct soil and terrain on my land but the sandpoint hits bedrock before water. Make sure you have a backup plan like a spring, a river, or enough rain.

Pivot fields are often very deep wells and have a tendency to lower the water table requiring home owners to drill even deeper. Check the water table and well depths in the area you are buying.

Thats true, as long as you trust the guy who has it on his land not to cut you off. People get weird' so best to plan for the worst and hope for the best.

Solar isnt that expensive, if you watch your power usage. I get by on about 20 amp hours a week. 400 watts of solar is plenty for me in WI. I have a little generator I can run for an hour to charge my system if it rains for a week.

Yeah I know that, but that takes a lot of land. More than you can afford and certainly more than a couple of acres
--- 2559802
>>2559251
>>2559792
I just looked it up and a acre of land is two fifths of a hectare. that is a miniscule amount of grass in a fertile area and in a semi-desert it's nothing.
You're delusional. get a job or change jobs, but don't come on 4channel to larp we're trying to help you here
--- 2559824
I've done the math on this and am actively planning to live the /out/ escapist LARP. 600,000 USD is the number. You're going to pay way more 1000 an acre for land that you can homestead with. Way more.

40 acres of land thats a combo of trees, water, flatland for buildings above floodzones, and grazing pasture. Acquired for 320,000 in 2020. It has a cabin, well, outhouse and I've added makeshift solar. Eventually I'll need to build roads in, build a barn, and build some kind of 4 season structure with real bathrooms, septic, a real solar battery setup or run grid power to it. That shit adds up very quickly.

Good news, land and home prices are going to drop like a rock in the coming months so if you've been saving your sheckles you'll have an opportunity coming up.

Well they have enough to run pivot farming so that means drilling a well for home use will be easy. This is not the case in much of the southwest.
If you have a home well on your property but no irrigation rights , you cant run a pivot , but you can run greenhouses with drip.

when you buy land and want to keep it /out/ related its stupid to spread EVERYONE out like some boomer shit. you want everyone as dense as possible to save the nature part of the land.. and not have stupid wide tracks from dozers and heavy equipment moving about so people can live their homesteading fetish. 

I've worked on communes and with them. the best system is to build an apartment complex style building. However no matter what it's the most expensive part...

a 24 unit building [thats 24 different people] would cost [back in 2017 mind you gonna be way more now] 3.7Million USD.. thats 154,167 PER person. for an 800 sq.ft apartment. This doesn't include parking pavement. or what would be required by some states yearly fire inspections and shit like that. so now you need some sort of Tax.. or HOA fee... basically you cannot escape the everyday meme.

Best thing would be to pool your money with a few friends, those you can trust, buy an old hotel/motel/apartment/duplex/warehouse/industrial building. turn it into small livable spaces. and then all you have to do is worry about what state park/BLM land you're closest too.

There's no good land for that little bit of money. Land that's that cheap is not suitable for any kind of agriculture that can make you money. Obviously you can put cattle or sheep on any kind of land but if it won't support the animals you'll have to buy feed. If you want to garden or grow crops you'll never get it that cheap.

Probably an indistrial nursery for graft stock and dry rooted cane berries.

anon this is what a lot of struggling farmers do to get by until their farms have matured 
Why do you think that seems underage to suggest ?
--- 2572928
Bro this is just called being a redneck, I already live in rural America in Appalachia.

If you are moving onto land for agricultural development, you can actually get a subsidized loan like a VA loan, instead of getting ripped off by a bank.

It's because they want more people to move into the country and do agricultural development. This includes 97% of the USA, but over 80% of people live in concentrated urban or suburban regions. As a species, humanity is really just a blip of ant-like colonies surrounded by vast expanses of farms and wilderness, very caught up in its own self-importance.
--- 2572930
>>2572928

>If you are moving onto land for agricultural development, you can actually get a subsidized loan like a VA loan

It is called a USDA loan.

You can also lease pasture and cropland for under a hundred bucks an acre a year for agriculture. Pasture here is $24 an acre per year to lease, lot of people run their cattle and livestock on leased land, not everyone has thousands of acres. This is similar to how sharecropping worked.
--- 2572931
>>2571314
Just any realtor site like Zillow. Then I look for the property on an app that shows where government land is like Gaia GPS or OnX.
--- 2572939
>>2572930
>Pasture here is $24 an acre per year to lease
These are the updated figures, used to be a few dollars cheaper, and you get a higher rate for irrigated cropland of course.

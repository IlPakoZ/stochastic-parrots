Ive been exploring different parts of houston whether new areas, underground crypts, abandoned cremotoriums, or broadcasting stations. Im running out of places to explore and im looking for suggestions. Are there any abandoned places me and my friends can explore or go to? Preferably a place with low security or easy security.

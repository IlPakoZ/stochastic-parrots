Seems like even if you live in an apartment and aren't necessarily a construction worker that has to use the bed everyday. They work as the best platform to sleep, haul a bike, campfire wood, and a cooler of ice cold beer. Plus they do great for 98% of off roading that'll get you outside.

I'll be honest with you. You can do everything you mentioned with a sedan, admittedly not quite as comfortably. A hitch attachment is only a few hundred bucks (less if you diy) and with a small flatbed you can haul pretty much everything you expect to, especially if you go with something rear/all-wheel drive. You may take your truck off-roading once or twice a year, but if you have a $35k vehicle, odds are you don't want it to get scratched up. If you're getting a pickup, get a used one, get one that you won't feel bad beating around innawoods in, don't buy one that makes you look like a suburban dad in a midlife crisis.

I'm the OP to the post you replied too.

I'm glad you paid your shit off. I'm just a mechanic, Toyota engineers been taking notes from Chrysler the last 3/4 years... Also parts.. everything important has a 6 months back order it feels like.

You remember the "chip shortage" bs? Know the parts they made to keep up with demand. That's it.. they didn't make backups for later down the road, they moved on to the next project. 

I would of told you to get a 2019 of some year instead... I don't hate trucks (tho I think to some extent a sedan is a better /out/ car.) 


Anyone reading this. Anything 2020 and up. That was a new body style/engine from its previous years. Stay away... The auto market has a huge quality control issue post covid. 2022 F350s are coming in left and right with dead rear axles.. some as low as 20k but normally 40k and below.. Chevys are seeing bad gasket surfaces. Dodges and their stupid ass half aluminum half Plastic radiators... Oh euro? BMW m3s power steering pumps, pump works. Chip set inside of the pump itself fails randomly throwing error codes. Sometimes putting the car in limp mode.

If you have to buy new- I guess do it. But it's not the cars of old for awhile longer.. you HAVE to do maintenance.. otherwise you won't see 100k.. even on historically reliable brands.

Little protip if you're looking to buy new- most shops use something called Mitchell1 it has manuals and shit for us mechanics. It also has service bulletins for common failures reported. And at what milage.. ask the dealership techs to look into it and see what so far on the car ur looking to get has reported. So you know what to keep an eye on.(buy one lunch even to sweeten the deal on their end..)

2012 Tacoma with a double cab and short bed. 4WD with tow package, of course.

I'm wondering what all of the options are for stealth camping with a small, sub 5 foot bed. Shorter people can get away with laying diagonal in short beds. I think the best option for taller people is to build a platform in the double cab like this 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSJSTk5TJuU [Embed]
--- 2562487
>>2562484
Stealth camping would be harder, you would pretty much have to do what you liked or drop the tailgate and use a bed extender, which wouldn't be as stealthy.
--- 2562504
>>2562484
You can get extension tent thingies if you have a shell, or a whole tent that fits in the bed with the tailgate down if you don't. If you really want to go all-in with the overland shit you can run a bed rack with a rooftop tent too. 

Obviously you can just go with the simple solution and set a regular tent up next to the truck as well.
--- 2562522
No one else finds it soulless all using Toyota Tacomas? I get they're the king of the midsize trucks but damn no one is making the case to own a Jeep. Honestly if you're going to sleep in your truck, just get a Suburban of sorts. Even maintained forest service roads cant be all that much more challenging that an AWD car cant handle.

The issue is that anything else deprecates so much, that only a Taco makes sense if you have the $, you get so much back one day. The aftermarket, the universal standard makes it appealing. Not "I'm a special unique person so I buy a weirdo niche and show it through a consumer item" 

Me? I've had compact cars and full size SUVs. Like them both
--- 2562731
>>2562526
Eh I could see that to an extent but when everyone in your group of friends has either a 4runner or Tacoma maybe an F150 even it begins to get bland. The overland community loves these trucks for good reason.
--- 2562784
>>2562526

I considered a Taco, but when I realized that the Tundra was refreshed last year and had a bunch of nice tech, I went with that. I know it might end up biting me in the ass being an earlier adopter, but it really is comfy as fuck on the inside.
--- 2562797
Trucks are shit for OUT. Look at all these boomers posting their clean trucks on paved roads. I did more offroading by the time I was 20 in a 92 Chevy cavalier than most of these retards have done their entire life.

I have a Ranger. It doesn't hold value like a Taco, but I bought mine used so that was an advantage. It's also superior to the Taco in some ways, for example the payload (which BTFOs other midsizes in off road trim and even some half tons) is a big deal if you want to go crazy with overland kit, it's a better tow rig, better at altitude which is probably relevant if you're in the western half of the US, etc. It's also got a really solid aftermarket since it's an extremely popular truck globally, especially in Australia. 

The bed isn't sleepable without janky solutions but I didn't buy the truck with that in mind.

The problem is the lack of decent SUVs for the purpose, at least in the US. The 4Runner is really the only decent option left and it's an overpriced dinosaur. Everything else is either a gigantic land barge that's designed to be a premium Uber rather than an off roader or it's a Wrangler/Bronco that's good at climbing rocks but shitty for anything else. 

I wish Ford sold an Americanized Everest, it's basically a straight SUV conversion of the Ranger, like what Explorers used to be, and there's a good chance I would've gone with one instead of my Ranger if they'd sold it here.

You can import the Hilux from south American pretty easily. I know a few guys here in Florida who will go to their home countries and buy you one and drive it back for 2k/3k extra. And can be registered here. Now if I can just get someone to help me import a new jimny...

camper tops exist, and also truck bed vs suv roof have a lot of upsides and downsides to consider if you're ever planning an overlanding type build with a popup tent. 
>>2562902
you don't buy a new suv to do offroading and overlanding and shit. you buy something older thats a bit cosmetically fucked and build your offroader/overlander. the newer it is the worse it probably is for offroading. the only exception is if you're saudi oil baron level rich and commissioning some custom gazillion dollar overlander. some of the military auction vehicles euros can get are cool as fuck too. my buddy built a 6x6 unimog ages ago. 
>>2563094
nta but i can get my lowered-but-not-stanced e30 down most trailheads in washington fine. i don't even really pay attention to what car i'm taking on a hike unless someone says its fucked on alltrails. the worst case its ever been is i hike an extra mile or two. 
way back in high school i took my taurus up and down all kinds of pnw mountains and unmarked logging roads going to raves out in the woods, and i took it down a pretty gnarly trail pretty fast running from the cops once. 
you blow up suspension components every once in a while but its honestly not that bad if you don't care about your spine, have a little ride height, and have it on something small like 14's or 15's with old school balloon tires.
the main thing that makes modern cars fall apart and drive like ass the second they're off pavement is the rubber band thin tires and big ass wheels that are trendy right now. if you just put smaller wheels and fatter tires on them and relax the stance a bit they drive fine off road if you can dodge potholes. its just physics. the wheelbase being so short and the car being so narrow makes offroading inherently easier.
--- 2563117
>muh flashy trucks with no dirt on em
nah some people keep their offroad vehicles clean. i never liked that trope. the local s&amp;r guys here keep their trucks spotless and probably suck each other's dicks about it too. probably don't use them often but it doesn't mean they're not seriously capable builds.
if ur not a car guy here's what to look for to tell if a truck actually gets offroaded:
- it probably has dents/paint damage/rock chips.
- the truck will not have the stock front bumper. if its a diy bumper sven welded up himself, they definitely offroad. if its from a kit its either a higher budget build or a poser. 
offroad vehicles don't necessarily need to have rock bars or an aftermarket rear bumper or a snorkel or anything else really associated with the look.
- probably not an offroad vehicle if its wheels are bigger than 16". if the wheels are aluminum the owner is either serious + richfag or a poser. it probably has all terrains or mud tires on it and if its a real offroader they're probably not xbox hueg.
this isn't always the case, swapping tires and having 2 sets of wheels is a thing. 
- generally not as lifted as ud assume if its not a prerunner/jumper
- just look up what a drop bracket lift looks like, those arent offroaders
- theres more people who imitate the look of an offroad vehicle than ppl who drive offroad vehicles in the wild, especially confirmation bias because nobody drives their offroader on the street
might have missed a thing or two but that's the thought process anyone who knows 'em has when they see one in the wild.

If it's gonna be a dedicated hardcore rig, sure. Some of us need a daily driver that can do double duty, though, and it's been long enough since real 4x4 body on frame SUVs were common that you have to go pretty old, high mileage, and usually beat to shit or badly modded by previous owners, plus the good stuff is starting to cost stupid money.

I built pic related from frame up about 10 years ago. It's starting to show it's age, so I'm going to make it a little more off road capable on this go around.

 Plan to replace the rusting bed with a steel flat bed with built in ramps for loading atv, add a selectable locker in the rear axle, lift it slightly more and bump up to a 35" tire, build steel bumpers with hitch receivers and wire both with power points so I can run a winch at either end. And install the on board air system I've had in my garage collecting dust. Oh and swap in a 5 speed so I can have an OD gear for longer drives
--- 2563977

This is the main reason I bought a tacoma. I bought a 2015 model in ~2018 and I can resell it now for roughly how much I bought it for. It's a great multi-use vehicle, since I can move large things in the bed, camp, drive in cities/long distances, etc. I owned a 94 jeep before this, which was obviously better in the offroading niche, but not great at anything else.

--- 2564060
The best /out/ car would probably be a extended cab 8ft truck bed with a camper shell (soft or hard). Unfortunately that is not even made unless you get 1/2 or 3/4 ton pickup. So you will have to settle for double cab tacoma with the 6 foot bed. Any bed shorter than 6 foot is retarded. Just buy a suv/subaru at that point. 4x4 is not required but is nice to have. Now what is necessary is getting a good AT tire like BFG K02 TA or other comparable, if you spend a lot of time off road, then you will need to get some nicer shocks. But that will be all you need.
--- 2564063
How feasible would a light offroad motorcycle be for taking to a trailhead? Unfortunately trailhead theft is common enough here that I'm hesitant, but it seems like a cheap way to make it up forest roads with potholes and such.

I don't know about that. There's a distinct lack of toyota hiluxes and landcruisers in this thread. It's a shame that utes didn't take off in america, especially diesel single-cabs like the 2006 SR in the picture which is what I drive but with a longer 2.4m steel tray. All these US trucks are a sea of cabin and shiny panels without much room to carry anything.

City dweller here, there is plenty of quiet places you can go to in and out of National Parks that are on unpaved and barely maintained roads. Don't hesitate, get a look and plan a little. Be aware of weather conditions and your car's limits. In my case, it's the low clearance and bad traction in loose/wet sand that I have to watch for, so true offroad is kinda off. The important thing is that your /out/ stuff fit in. Might go for something bigger as my next drive, surely not a truck, but this thread is interesting.

Every machine is a compromise in one direction or another.

 Is it worth the investment to skidplate the underside of the truck for general fucking about?
--- 2564423

You don't need skids, the Dalton isn't particularly rough but you will have to endure some nasty adhesive mud. Skidplates might be nice just to keep your underside cleaner, and to deter the fawkin cat thieves.

You can usually get through with a car, holding up traffic with the seat cover sucked up your bung, but it's the last twenty feet that brings problems. 
Steep driveways, plow berms, can't park off the road. It's always some scoobaru homo that's parked blocking the removal equipment. And you never see em helping another vehicle get out.
Altruism for the ditch magnets is the truck's prerogative.

Driving on snow in the flat is easy with All-Seasons. Driving up a mountain to 11000' wasnt even a challenge except going UP steep climbs from low speed. Descending down though, yeah that's where your tires are everything... Going slow worked for me but there was a steep downhill corner I lost control. No crash, quickly recovered, but realize "going slow" isn't a fix. AWD is a meme for cars. Probably needed on 4000lbs crossovers and 5000lbs pickups.

120k is nothing for a maintained truck.. remember truck transmissions are not CVT...

Idk, why did cars and trucks in the early 2010's suddenly go from 90% being 4 to 5 star safety ratings to suddenly only 15% being 4 to 5 stars? Why did full-size trucks suddenly go from V8's to twin turbo V6's? Why are midsize trucks all turbo 4 cylinders now?

Mid and respectable aren't that far apart and the rank isn't an indictment on the Explorer. I tried to limit each brand to 2 in each tier for balance. Explorers are great SUVs in my opinion, but Rangers and Broncos have almost universal praise and have a higher proportion of people using them as dedicated off road vehicles. JK/JL Wranglers are in basic with new Subarus because for every 1 Wrangler sold to drive off-road, 5 are sold as gifts for someone's 16th birthday. Modern Subaru Crosstreks/Outbacks is just a case of 1 off-road/10 Whole Foods parking lot.

No, if you want a weakend adventure you are 2 chad options, that are cheap and do exactly what you need. 
Option 1) The duel sport bike with 20/80 tires. You can get a rack, and saddle bags and pack easy 40L of gear, or even up to 80L if you adjust your spring and go literally fucking ANYWHERE you have the ability to ride. If you are a big boy you can get a 650, and keep your sell on logging trails and well troden paths, if you are a skilled rider you can even take harder single trail tracks to get inna woods, just dont drop your bike, a 650+Gear is a heavy bitch. Or get yourself a little DRZ400 and load it up with either 40 or 80L and more or less have a dirt bike, with blinkers, gonna be slower on the highway unless you mod it with a smaller sproket and or hot cams but then you are also scrificing low end torque. 

Option 2) Get your self an old CJ5 or CJ7, learn how to work it.get a cable winch, Hi lift jack, and a spare tire and go out in it. You can easy load up all your gear into it that you would ever need for a weekend and longer even. 

A bike will run you easy under 7k, like 4k for a DRZ, Jeep will run you a bit more, probably closer to 10k.

overland rigs are probably S+ Tier, but its a lot of money to invest in a gen 3 taco to get it to that point. a stock SR5 with 4wd should get you down most off road/ overland trails. just know that if you dont spend the money to upgrade it, its gonna go real slow on uneven terrain.

You've never driven a 4runner off road or in deep snow if you think that. The weight distribution is totally different. Any 4runner older than a 2003 has a completely different feel than any truck... anything past a 2003 4runner is shit not worth arguing about.

Motorhome, with a small trailer or just a tongue mounted motorcycle mount. 

turns like a school bus- but at least doesn't turn like a semi truck.

Only need insurance for one thing.

Cheapest new motorhome RN is like 100k.
RV/truck combo gonna have you sitting WELL above that. 

don't need to struggle parking for gas in smaller gas stations. and parking in general is actually easier. 

Arguably more comfortable to drive a motorhome then any seats chevy/ford are cranking out the last 15+ years.

depending on what you get, easier to replace 6 tires, then 8. or if your RV is too big you're pulling a with a dually- 10 even.

Truck bed camper limits you the least but is the least comfy, you can take a camper almost anywhere your truck can go.
A trailer means your truck can die without you losing your bed, a huge positive if you're living out of it.

Depends, I would say yes if you were referring to a Hilux, Dmax or Navara but no if you're talking about one of those massive fuck off RAM f150s. The smaller utes are better for a number of reasons and their also proven reliable. Also those SUVs like Nissan Patrols or Land Cruiser 80s are pretty good too. I prefer utes more because I use the bed more. 
>>2563332
It's the trend from America. Just like the people spending thousands of dollars the convert right hand drive RAM f150s to left hand drive so they're road legal.

This. I take my Toyota yaris to stupid places. I take it on forest roads and deep in the bad lands up north and out west in the USA. It handles most things that you want, while being cheap as hell to maintain. No, I can't get everywhere. No, I'm not taking kids. I'm going out west and getting as deep into shit as I can. It handles most of Missouri and Arkansas fine. There's some places I run into that need clearance. That's my limiting factor. 

From central Illinois to North Carolina, to Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, this dumb hatchback has handled it all with very minimal repairs. I've had to build up and modify my path at times but as long as you don't fall into ruts or ditches you just keep going. 
If I can do all this shit with a yaris I don't know what's stopping anyone else.

NPS is good at paperwork: especially concerning tracing income and expenses. If it's a national park--it's listed.
Stat Parks and Recreation tracks local parks and there is a national orginisation they all align with. There is also the NRPA which works with parks and rec.

This debate is pointless because each person's needs, wants, and abilities are going to differ.

For many people a truck may be just fine for the type of offroading they do, or hell even awd pos s.u.v

others need to be able to navigate tight, rocky, steep inclines, and do real hardcore rock crawling, which require short wheelbase, good departure break over and approach angles, high clearance vehicle with locking diffs and 4 to 1 low. On technical trails like Johnson Valley, the vast majority of pick up trucks would get gaped. If all you're doing is mudding, then fine, drag a stock Tacoma through. 

Then there are people who are better serviced by atv dirt bikes and dual sports as they will be riding very tight trail or single track.

Then there are people with pick up truck beds that are 4 feet; pathetically small, useless, then there's 8 foot beds you can sleep in, with camper installed you will be super comfy, lik a mini cabin. Then you have folks trailering, both on road and offroad trailers. the possibilities and terrain is endlessly varying and only you an decide what's best.

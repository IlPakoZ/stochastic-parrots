We seem to have some debate over med kits so let us discuss them. I carry;

>Israeli trauma bandage 
>Snake bite bandage 
>Imodium 
>Promethazine
>5x band aid
>5x alcohol wipes 

I don't see a reason to carry more. What do you carry?
--- 2545337
>>2545333 (OP)
I'd add some Bactine for sterilizing wounds and killing the pain, and some iodine for cleaning them out. And gauze. More fucking gauze than you know what to do with. And at least one dose of QuickClot for leakers. Other than that I think you're good.
--- 2545340
Checked and kek'd, I'm enjoying the first aid gatekeeping in the UL thread. I've got a little boo-boo kit for day hikes and overnighters:
>3x band-aids
>liquid bandage (also flammable)
>antibiotic ointment (mostly just fills space and keeps things from rattling)
>5x alcohol pads
I have a more serious kit if I plan to be way out for multiple days. It does not have chest seals.
--- 2545343
>>2545337
When you say "dose" of QC, do you mean one of their sponges, or a powder form? All I see from the actual company these days is dressings.
--- 2545345
>>2545333 (OP)
You need a tourniquet, burn spray, some type of sting treatment, and butterfly stitches as well. Maybe those disposable scalpels too. Picrel for simple tourniquet.

>>2545340
No idea what UL is but you should have a chest seal with you.
--- 2545351
>>2545333 (OP)
No blister treatment? Get some leukotape and a safety pin. It’s probably the single most common hiking injury. 

Add some gauze and you can make your own bandaids. The adhesive on the leukotape is way, way better than bandaids, and it can be cut to different shapes and sizes (quite easily if you have scissors).

I think a lot of people overlook how simple a TQ can be. If you're seriously leaking, you don't have time to fret over a sterile TQ with a carbon fiber windlass and hypo-allergenic velcro. You can use all sorts of shit.
--- 2545383
>>2545369
I read that a tourniquet goes above the wound while the Jew bandage goes over it. Either way, no one in this thread has ever had to use one while out. Inb4 “yes I did.” No you didn’t. Take your bullshit LARP back to /k/.
--- 2545391
>>2545381
Even rope can be used as one.

>>2545383
The jew bandage has enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. The reality is that if you're applying a tourniquet then you think you're going to die. There's no need to apply both. You can completely cut off the circulation to the limb using the jew bandage as a tourniquet so there is no need to use it as a bandage.

Man half your post was you dropping a pre-emptive argument it's no wonder I mentally filtered it kek. It's weird to see. I have never had to nor claimed that I have had to use a tourniquet however if I do both my snake bite bandage and my israeli bandage can be used as a tourniquet. I'm much more likely to slip over and slash an odd part of my body on a rock, this is where the israeli bandage comes into play but the snake bite bandage can also be used. There's no need to start dropping pre-emptive arguments based on nothing but your own imagination. I'm hoping I never have to apply a tourniquet. There's also no need to carry a dedicated one as both my bandages can do the job.
--- 2545402

My bad, I thought an Israeli bandage was for stuffing wounds.

>>2545381
But a normal tourniquet is also $25 on Amazon. It's easy enough to get one, throw it in the outer pocket of your pack, and forget about it. I wouldn't want to be attempting to tear my shirt or use rope or something if I'm bleeding that badly.

It assuredly is not Anon. Israeli Dressing is a pressure dressing, it goes on the wound. Tourniquet is a tourniquet, it goes high and tight to restrict blood flow to the wound. It takes like 30s of internet searching to figure this shit out.

An israeli bandage provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. If you tear one sleeve off your shirt, that torn sleeve provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. If you carry any type of rope, that rope provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. If you carry a snake bite bandage, that snake bite bandage provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet. In most cases your shoelace provides enough compression to be used as a tourniquet.

Why the fuck are you weirdos so obsessed with dedicated tourniquets. All it has to do is cut off circulation.

--- 2545535
>>2545527
Because if I need a tourniquet I want to use a tourniquet. Not the sleeve of my shirt or waste my Israeli bandage by tying it ABOVE the wound and then having to find a windlass. If you're able to stop the bleed from a wound by applying direct pressure to it, then you didn't need to use a tourniquet in the first place. If you can provide some valid documentation proving otherwise I'll happily concede the point.

It is amazing how fast the human body looses strengh, once you poke a hole in it. You wont be able to rip your sleeve and improvise a TQ, if a major artery has been nicked. Be trained, be prepared, be ready.
--- 2545716
>>2545527
>Why the fuck are you weirdos so obsessed with dedicated tourniquets. All it has to do is cut off circulation.
Because dedicated tqs work better

>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2738052
In a study of 102 laymen who had just completed an ACS Bleeding Control Basic training only 32.4% of participants were able to correctly apply an improvised tourniquet (defined as one that provided sufficient pressure to halt bleeding) even in a non-stressful situation when provided with appropriate materials (i.e. they didn't have to think about taking their belt off or searching for a windlass). In comparison 92.2% of participants correctly applied a CAT tourniquet.
Interestingly people were better off with an improvised tq than using SWAT-T or RATS.

>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26125163/
Without a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 99% of tests (79 of 80 tests). With a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 32% of tests (p &lt; .0001).

>https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(20)31170-7/fulltext
In a study80 hospital employees (including a mix of healthcare professionals and non-healthcare hospital employees) 32% of subjects were able to stop simulated hemorrhage on the initial improvised tourniquet trial, this number rose to 68% following simulator-based training instructing them on the use of commercial and improvised training. In comparison 94% of subjects using CAT tourniquet were able to successfully stop simulated hemorrhage. 
Read that again, even after dedicated training and practice only 68% of individuals could control bleeding using an improvised tourniquet. This was in ideal situations after being provided with a wide variety of appropriate tourniquet materials, and applying it to a manikin rather than one-handed on their own body.
--- 2545719
>>2545716
So lessons from this
>Carry a commercial tourniquet if you can
>If you're caught without one then make sure your improvised tourniquet is a windlass designed, don't just slap a belt around the limb and try to pull it tight like a retard. 
>Be aware of failure points. If you read the articles I linked some of failures of improvised tourniquets were the result of belts snapping at the belt buckle when people turned the windlass to tighten them or shit like that.
>Ideally a tourniquet should have a cuff at least 1.5'' wide. Thinner tqs such as wire, tubing or bootlaces tend to be much more painful and carry a greater risk of neurological injury.

Depends on the area and what you're doing. Not hard to get shot by someone who's mistaken you for a turkey or to slip and slice your arm open with a knife or hatchet.

What a sad statement

I don’t take a hatchet when wilderness backpacking, that’s bushcraft LARP shit, and you shouldn’t be carelessly walking around with it like that in the first place.
What kind of retard doesn’t either carry it with the sheath on, or at least with the blade facing away from them?
Either way, I would put using an axe or hatchet in the same catagory as chainsaw or gun.
If you’re doing something that could mangle or kill you accidentally when using it, then yah carrying a tourniquet makes sense.

>>2546032
Important for all readers, first aid actions are almost universally limited to keeping the blood in and the body working long enough for someone with real training and real equipment support to do the real saving. Which is exactly why purpose built items like a good TQ (cat, softtw) are a thing, because several years of GWOT have shown that even crayon eaters can save lives with this one simple trick. Agree with most others here though, the complexity of the kit increases as risk (hatchets, trail difficulty and remoteness, hunting season) increase.

Your actually more likely to use one on the ride to and from the trail, so a car kit is pretty good kit.

--- 2546367

/out/ disagrees. The board considers literally anything done outside to be an outdoor activity. If you step into your backyard to smoke a pipe, these retards think that counts.

Cos you might accidentally kill somebody by giving them a painkiller
I am not joking
Occupational first aid kits, whether they are for yourself or your team, cannot contain any pharmaceutical products
So everyone who has a first aid kit needs to carry two, so if there is an incident you can tell HSE you just used the legal first aid kit and the "comfort kit" is your prescription medication even though everyone knows it's basic shit
This is the same country where complimentary plastic cutlery was removed from petrol stations and ready meals etc because they're legally a weapon, so that should tell you all you need to know about the quality of our laws

I'm an unrepentant optimist who carries a blister kit and ibuprofen, gauze, and tape. This has always worked for me, but I unfortunately watched a person die from a fall. A tourniquet wouldn't have saved her, but after reading this thread I think a CAT will go with me on some outings.

>>2546561
Walking down a steep muddy slope you slip, trip, and fall forward. Your bow flies outta your hand and an arrow lands with the broadhead pointing up at you. The broadhead pierces your femoral artery. Ok, I know it's a long shot but I have tripped, let go of my bow, and an arrow came out of the quiver. I'm not saying you should carry a tourniquet, just saying that I will because 6 razor sharp pointy sticks is enough for me. Also, my fukken idiot brother slipped while climbing up to his stand and landed on his bow.

Recently I read about a hiker who stepped off the trail and found a broadhead tipped arrow with his leg. It was all over the news a couple of months ago.

>>2546601
Accidents occur all the time. A pack of gauze and a TQ cover a lot. Anything beyond a few minutes from immediate professional and equipped help is potentially a fatal injury that you could help prevent for the low price of knowing some shit and items costing less than a night out.

Normally I dont even bring the duct tape. I like my stuff to be multi purpose, and multi use. Most injuries you sustain will either not be physical, or be inconsequential. Yes, a cut that bleeds for five minutes before stopping is inconsequential. tape that shit and move on. If you manage to fuck up bad enough that you need actual bandages, then you better hope you have a buddy.

I probably should have worded that better, lmao. I meant the main threats you should have contingencies for are from exposure. Dehydration is a lot more likely than a compound fracture, and if you're one of those herbalist types, you had BETTER have something for poison. 

My main point was that if you find yourself suddenly with a sucking chest wound, odds are you will not be patching yourself up. If you find yourself with a deep cut, just tape it. If you find yourself with a cut artery, you best tie off your limb right the fuck yesterday, because you have seconds before you get woozy. Dont be the kind of guy who pre-ties a tourniquet to every limb, and wears chain mail, but also don't be the guy who brings a wet wipe and some band-aids and says "yeah ill manage".

I don’t think it’s that common. It probably is close to zero. When it comes to hiking it’s only like 140 people a year. About half are from falling off of mountains while climbing. Then you have drownings, a few animal attacks (including bee stings), natural causes, and exposure.

Take a step back and try to look from the outside. Let’s presuppose that both groups have zero real world experience. So where can they draw their opinions from?

The UL faggots can look at people who have done what they’re claiming to do. Thruhikers are a prime example. The Trek takes a survey of AT hikers every year, so there’s actual data. The hikers themselves provide literally thousands of anecdotes from plenty of different trails. UL trannies can also look at individuals with a lot of accomplishments. Andrew Skurka is brought up often. He’s done insane hikes, including thousands of miles of off-trail hiking, as well as leading groups of dumbass rich folks off trail (groups are more prone to injury). 

/k/ faggots don’t have that option, because anyone spending a lot of time outside will have the same opinion as the UL faggots.

Sliding down a slope and getting stabbed by a muddy stick. 

It was something that was standard in my blow out kit. Asked the corpsman about it and he said it goes through different iterations as they learn more, but basically the idea was the ibuprofen and acetaminophen taken together eased the pain better than anything else and taking an internal anti-biotic was a fail safe. I know the corpsman carried morphine lollipops but I don’t think I’ll be getting my hands on those.

this is true for things like sprains etc. I destroyed my ankle years ago, level 3 sprain and avulsion fracture, an ER doc friend of mine said the acetaminophen/ibuprofen or naproxen stack is nearly as effective as opiates for that kind of injury. but that's at the 4000mg acetaminophen and 1000mg of naproxen per 24hrs dosage

The only thing not CoTCCC recommended that I would still put in a kit is a SWAT. The reason they don't recommend this is because it's hard to apply to your self, but it works well if it's not you strapping yourself up, and it can be used for several other things aside from being a TQ. (and it's cheap, so replacing it isn't painful).

Yes, they would look at people who have been shot or blown up with bazookas and model their recreational outdoor first aid kits after that. It’s why they’re talking about tourniquets.

No, that was a real problem. The original formulation could reach 95C and cause full-thickness burns even when used as recommended. The issue was especially bad when used to pack deep wounds or covered by thick dressings and left to cook over a long evac flight.
Wasn't just the powder either. The sponge form would do the same.

They've changed the formulation now though and I'd assume you can't even buy the old stuff. 

The concerns around strokes/clots is a whole different issue.

Difficult enough apparently. I'd buy a tourniquet rather than risk being one of the 67.6% of people who fail to improvise a functional tourniquet. 

See >>2545716

>In a study of 102 laymen who had just completed an ACS Bleeding Control Basic training only 32.4% of participants were able to correctly apply an improvised tourniquet (defined as one that provided sufficient pressure to halt bleeding) even in a non-stressful situation when provided with appropriate materials (i.e. they didn't have to think about taking their belt off or searching for a windlass). In comparison 92.2% of participants correctly applied a CAT tourniquet.
>Interestingly people were better off with an improvised tq than using SWAT-T or RATS.
>>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26125163/
>Without a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 99% of tests (79 of 80 tests). With a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 32% of tests (p &lt; .0001).
>>https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(20)31170-7/fulltext
>In a study80 hospital employees (including a mix of healthcare professionals and non-healthcare hospital employees) 32% of subjects were able to stop simulated hemorrhage on the initial improvised tourniquet trial, this number rose to 68% following simulator-based training instructing them on the use of commercial and improvised training. In comparison 94% of subjects using CAT tourniquet were able to successfully stop simulated hemorrhage.
>Read that again, even after dedicated training and practice only 68% of individuals could control bleeding using an improvised tourniquet. This was in ideal situations after being provided with a wide variety of appropriate tourniquet materials, and applying it to a manikin rather than one-handed on their own body.

While the hospital employees study is bullshit because they used a mix (I assume a few cafeteria workers, admin jockeys and custodians got in there), it's still concerning that so few could improv a TQ before they had their hands held. Our medical system really is shit.

improvised tq fails in the overwhelming majority of cases. You don't have time to "macgyover" one when there is a femoral injury. It is better if you don't have a tq to pack the wound with a clean cloth or hemostatic gauze. You should carry a real tq hunting or shooting. Otherwise it is unnecessary because you are unlikely to experience femoral trauma except with a gunshot wound. A space blanket is 10x more likely to save your life than a tq

Thanks for making this thread bro, made me realise my antiseptic had leaked. 

I only have 1 med kit which I take with me everywhere but it does what I need it to

Contains:
>empty plastic bag
>surgical gloves
>shock blanket
>insect bite cream
>cotton buds
>safety pins
>small scissors
>tweezers
>ibuprofen &amp; paracetamol 
>strepsils
>antiseptic
>triangular bandage
>x4 alcohol wipes
>x3 gauze swabs
>x3 roll bandages
>x2 adhesive tape
and as many bandaids as I can fit.

When going camping I typically stick the Micropur and Hydralyte in there too.

Have made use of everything at least once except for the shock blanket, triangular bandage and surgical gloves. 

Also been meaning to get some snake bandages but just haven't gotten around to it yet.

Any recommendations bros? Also what the fuck is an "Israeli bandage"?

Israeli bandage is a compression wrap with a sewn on dressing and a pressure applicator bar built into the wrap. It is like a snakebite/ace bandage but can be self administered one handed and apply pinpoint pressure to control a venous hemorrhage. You should buy a "T3" style Israeli bandage because it includes a detachable secondary dressing and important wound packing gauze that can even be used stop an arterial hemorrhage (massive hemorrhage) for around the same weight and bulk as the non-t3 (old) style ones.

Bring medical tape so you can tape an ankle or make a splint. Leuko tape works best and can be used to prevent blisters.

Australian, I assume? Pretty sure pressure bandages aren't recommended elsewhere in the world.

It’s one thing to be a larper and bring a trama kit without having anything bandaids. But bringing something to stop serious bleeding while doing any sort of extreme sport is different. Yeah it might not happen and you have never experienced it but this stuff does happen and when it does you will wish you had something besides your shirt

The last time I personally saw an actual firefight was 2019 in Syria. I know Green Berets and Rangers who've killed people in the last year. Combat is more sporadic now, yes, but it still manages to happen occasionally. Unless you're a Marine or something, then you're literally not deploying to do fuck-all.

Yeup. Honestly not too worried about snakes, my typical camping buddies are herpers, but it's good to always be prepared

Do you bring a satellite phone along with the tourniquet? Because if you have to use it on a limb but you're 50km+ away from any busy roads or phone reception, aren't you pretty much fucked anyway?

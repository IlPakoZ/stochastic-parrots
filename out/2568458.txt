You should have a spool of nice thick wire anyway anon, it's very useful

and you can make a belt hook out of it, obviously

You can wear a belt even if your biking shorts don't have belt loops.

Just go buy some cargo pants. And cut them off to make shorts with belt loops

I have a cheap nylon belt that I clip my machete to. It's like a duty belt solely for it. I can easily take it off or sling it in a different location.

Literally any cheap belt off of Amazon. It's not a specialized product at all.

Just use a work belt.

Get one of these and rig it as a shoulder carry. Tape it when you get it a size you like.

Friction buckles are awful for anything /out/

If you can get away with wearing shorts, do you really need a machete?

Ok, fair point but my take was about belts + shorts.

Either wear a belt, sew the sheath to your pants, or install a magnet in your hip.

I got that sheath for my Tramontina bolo. It cut through the stitching first time I used it. It's an ok sheath but could be sturdier. I keep a DC4 stone in bottom pouch, just big enough for it. Shame the top pouch is smaller or I could put a CC4 in it just because. The stone that came with it is shit.

I've never used the belt loop on sheaths, it stays in my pack til it gets used then goes back in it.

Just have your wife sew beltloops onto your shorts.

I don't know how you want to carry it but this is the best Machete ever made.

Stainless
10 inch blade
just shy of 17 inches total
Chops better than a blade twice as long.

I look forward to billhook anon challenging your opinion.
Also I'm pretty sure op already has a blade as he's asking how to carry it.

Billyhook anon is a larping faggot who lives in the UK. He uses it in his back yard.
The how to carry it's been solved several times already. Hell, half the time I carry mine in a satchel--I have this exact blade but high carbon and wish I'd gotten the stainless.
The size and balance is perfect--a field blade needs to be stainless or it's just another gardening tool that needs to be pampered.

I have one of these that my 16inch machete fits in. Mine is over 20 years old and doesn't have the label on it though.

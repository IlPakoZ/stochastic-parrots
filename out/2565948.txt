>>Soap (sell at a steep price to retarded urbanites)
>>Essential oils (sell at a steep price to retarded urbanites)

Idk anon. What can you do with lavender?

I'd be more interested in having it for myself or giving it away to my friends than making a commercial product out of it. Is making essential oil hard? What do you even do with it? Spray it on yourself to smell lovely?

buy a still and extract the oil.

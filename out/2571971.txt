So it is inevitable to get lyme disease if you're an outdoors person? I just don't see how it can avoided 100% of the time. It'll eventually get you.
--- 2571974
>>2571971 (OP)
the main thing is to remove them as soon as you see them, as long as you remove the ticks in around 36 hours, you're pretty safe from disease
frequent bathing, i.e., merely soaking in water for a bit helps a lot too; wearing light clothing apparently helps, and using a repellent helps even more
also, when taking off a tick, you wanna pull / lift them off without squeezing them, as it just puts that shit back into you, wherever it came from or was brewed into
imho, the "Protick Remedy" tick remover is the best choice to remove them, its able to remove even really small ticks &amp; easily fits on a keychain

i mostly hike in winter/autumn, if i hike in summer it's at high/alpine elevations
the slopes are very steep on the Alps/Apennines so not too much wildlife for them to feed on
also permethrine and closing the pants to the socks with tape

Well yeah, the west has no forest so there's nowhere for ticks to live.

Lyme is contained in a small part of the US, only the North East has that problem.

It's like you both went full retard at the same time. Saying the west has no trees is as insane as calling the earth flat. Ticks are all over in the west, people just dont get them because they literally don't go outside in nature.

In BC, less than 1 percent of ticks tested carry the lab-leaked genetically engineered bacteria B. burgdorferi that cause Lyme disease. I said we don't have to worry about ticks, not that there aren't any out west.

These look like Dermacentor variabilis, which don't carry Lyme (but they do carry RMSF and tularemia, which are honestly more scary to me).

You can tuck your pants in and stay on trail if you really want to be safe, but IMO daily tick checks if you're going out are the easiest way to prevent Lyme and other tick-borne illnesses. Like >>2571974 said, even if you do get a tick they're pretty easy to remove. If you only catch them in the infectious window, there's lots of intervention and treatment available (at least for Lyme). Also, there is no real evidence for the existence of chronic Lyme – it's generally thought to be a Munchie disease.

I got rocky mountain tick fever as a kid, my mom said it almost killed me, I just remember it being awful, I'd get a really high fever for a couple days, then feel better, and then it would come back. This was northern Colorado. I live in Idaho now and ive gotten a few ticks on me but no bullseye rashes or any negative side effects. I think Lyme is rare around here.
--- 2572335
I caught it as a young teen in MA
Never saw the red circle or anything, then one day my knee was the size of a softball
It had been in my body deteriorating my joints until my meniscus tore
Bounced around several doctors in the south east until one thought to test me for lymes
They gave me some pills and knee surgery and I haven't had any other symptoms in 15+ years knock on wood

Rub lemongrass over yourself and keep some in your shoe between your sock. You can also just use essential oil if you don't have fresh. Lemon Balm works too.

Ticks are seriously ruining /out/ for me.
Why do these little niggers have to fucking exist?
I'm more afraid of ticks than wild animals.
It's just the aspect that you can't really do anything about it, besides searching your body, and some precautionary stuff.
But it's highly likely that you will miss a few.
With a bear, you know exactly what the fucking deal is. A bear doesn't puke viruses into your skin, and makes the rest of your life a painful miserable existence.
I hate them so much it's unreal.

Also, should I get vaccinated against Tick-borne encephalitis?
I live in a high risk area. There's 546 cases last year in Germany. 
I know that's a small number, but I live in an extreme risk area, and most people don't go /out/.

The answer to all tick questions: PERMETHRIN
--- 2573210
>>2572410
DEET is ok, but doesn't last terribly long and it melts plastic and causes vasodilation (a warming sensation). Permethrin-soaked socks and pants works wonders. You might get a tick on the clothes buy they will not bite.

As someone who lives deep inawoods, I see a fair amount of ticks. I'm not near neighbors, so most wildlife that ticks propagate on is somewhat sparse and seems to be a mitigating factor. Spring and fall seems to be when I see them the most, but usually only a dozen each season.

To fight them I tend to wear shorts in the summer as they seem to struggle on sweaty skin and leg hair. I can often feel them moving and get em before they make it too far. I also bunch up my socks at my boots. They seem to like to hide in the folds of the socks, thinking its fur and skin. Easy enough to check my socks when I get back to the cabin. I also use permethrin on my footwear and pants if I'm wearing them, and I've watched that kill a few. I also use it on my bedding and that seems to get any I happen to miss as I've found a few dead in my bed.

On top of that, I hide permethrin laced cotton balls inside pvc tubes in the spring and fall on my property. Rodents are a main vector for nymphs in the area and the mice build nests with the cotton balls which kills the ticks on them.

Guineafowl supposedly love them, but I haven't tried them yet. I have huskies and they are stone cold murderers. I'm not sure the guineas would survive. Another thing I plan to do is plant stuff they supposedly don't like.

All that said, for hiking and camping simple prevention measures like tucking in your pants, using tape, and using permethrin on your gear should take care of 95% of the bastards.

yeah thats right
--- 2573271
just found a fucking tick in my armpit after showing at work. What the hell. My eyes were closed and I felt a lump and thought it was a zit or sap in my hair so I ripped it out and saw the tick crawling and almost got flushed down the drain. Thankfully it wasn't bloated and I live in interior BC where Lyme disease shouldn't be a worry. Fuck you Connecticut for introducing and spreading this disease like wildfire though. Now it is impossible to eradicate.

Dealt with Lyme's. After my initial diagnosis, I was looking at $300 or so a week for my first round of treatments. Bought fish antibiotics and put myself on the amoxicillin regimen, 500mg 3 times a day for at least a month. Had to do it three separate times, haven't had any of the arthritic symptoms I had since I finished my last round. Always kept going for two weeks after the arthritic symptoms were completely gone. 
The biggest hill to climb was the gut issues, bleaching your gut can cause a lot of issues. The feeling of mixing concrete with bricks in your gut was the most debilitating.
>Cut your caffeine intake for at least 2 years after your last bout of antibiotics. Otherwise your morning coffee is lighting a 5 minute fuse.

Seriously, I haven’t had any legit excursions into untamed wilderness yet though I want to, and one of the main things that makes me hesitant is ticks and other biting bugs. I used to work outside rurally in the summer and would often just entirely cover myself in clothing and roast in the sun just to contend with the mosquitoes and horse flies. I don’t like spray either and don’t use it, but I think I might make an exception when going /out/ and use permethrin to protect against those disgusting little bastards. Luckily I live in Canada and have outdoor options where I don’t have to deal with those loathsome aberrations for half the year.

this is disappointing. I had plans to treat my clothing and gear, and maybe my dog's collar.

True. Just get them in the infectious window and you're fine for Lyme. But rocky mountain fever has me worried, as >>2572333 says, and I've heard anecdotal evidence it can lie dormant in your body and come back later.

I don’t get Lyme because ticks don’t get on me. 

I’ve had them crawling on my clothes but never on my skin. Probably they hop on me as part of their normal process but once they realize I stay surrounded by a cloud of farts all the time they bail. 

I eat chili mac from a can and mountain house chili mac pretty much straight on through all my /out/ings to keep the cloud up.

where i live we have an infestation with these fucks and many of them carry lyme or borrelia. i check my dog and myself each 10 minutes so that they can't even bite. if they bite, you have to remove them asap, as lyme and borrelia are transmitted after 4 to 8 hours after the bite

I don't like big pharma and pills but I live in a rural area and those pills are the only thing that saved my dogs from dying drowning in ticks. One of them was a fucking magnet and I could easily find over 30 ticks over his neck every other day. Shit was disgusting.

Permethrine your shit (it's sold in clothes and tensts as InsectShield, but it's just Permethrine).
Treat your inner tent, your sleeping bag, your upper part of the socks, your shoes, your trousers and your shirt.
Repeat every 5 or so wash cycles and you will be free from ticks.

None of them was vaccinated because they don't know it exists. I am but i think after a few years it wears off and other tick borne diseases are still a problem.
I use permethrin everywhere and tuck my pants into my socks. Particularly if you hike or hunt going through brushes and grass. Haven't had a single bite since.

Antibiotics are antibiotics. Cheap widely available antibiotics are only labeled as 'animal' products so that pharma companies can charge a premium for prescription drugs. If you can do half decent research before taking any medication, you'll be alright.

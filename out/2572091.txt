I dont understand why anyone would carry hiking sticks. I've never needed sticks to hike, but I have needed free hands before to climb over shit.

It's useful when trails are muddy, when you need to crawl under a tree, cross streams. Also spreads out joint wear.

Bingo. Just spent over 2k on some tactical hiking poles and I'm boogieing all over now.

You’ve never camped more than a few days, and only in fair weather. You’re fat. You’ve never backpacked more than a few miles, and even then your focus was on camping rather than hiking. You don’t even know the difference between camping and hiking. Your feet are softer than the inside of a vagina. You think pemmican and whole potatoes are a good choice for hiking food. You think pack weight isn’t important. You have no idea what you’re doing.

Of course you don't, because baitposters like you don't even go outdoors to begin with

it's useful in certain uneven terrain for balance, but there's no way I could justify carrying that retarded shit all the time. just pick up a stick in those areas and then throw it away when you're done.

Do not move any sticks this is against FMP and also disrupts insect habitats.

This here is
ULTRALIGHT COUNTRY
IF YOU AINT ULTRALIGHT
YOU AINT SHIT
You will never be accepted into the UL club if you're carrying those. (They are the cool people that do aktual hikes, you are not and don't aktually hike)
--- 2572174
trekking poles are fucking dope
--- 2572175
>>2572171
You're still carrying them with you dummy. If you need a stick just pick one up off the ground. When you don't need it anymore just throw it back on the ground.
--- 2572176
>>2572175
Moving sticks upsets the insects that need more money for them programs, chud.
--- 2572181
>>2572175
You're not carrying them in your hands. I assumed that's what you meant since the OP mentioned needing free hands.

walking sticks are gay yes but they also help to save your knees when walking downhill
nothing breaks knees faster than good old straight foot step downhill with all your weight for x amount of years and it is funny until it starts to ache and you have to walk with gay sticks for some time until you learned the lesson

Zpacks offers it as an accessory and Osprey includes it on a lot of their packs (sewn in). Anyone can make it with some shock cord and line locks. It’s a shame it hasn’t caught on. It works great with an umbrella as well.
--- 2572373
The truth is, I've never seen anyone use them properly. So in that sense, they don't need them. However, when used properly you are recruiting your upper body muscles which allows your legs to last way longer on climbs and go much faster.

Everybody was using old ski poles on the vocanos, with and without skis, long before they became a fad. 
Funny that nobody up on the hill questioned their manliness or if they were being used properly. 
Who gives a shit really.

Whether or not you use/like them is irrelevant. Vanity has no place in the outdoors. Stay in the city, boy.

Lol wtf I literally own this pack and poles and didn't know it did this
--- 2575068
i like a single 5ft stick for vaulting small gorges/streams
considerably easier than jumping with a full pack or tossing the pack over and picking it up after
--- 2575516

There retarded only use I could see for them is to prop up a tarp shelter or if your old/crippled
Imb4 you don't hike yes I do

Not everyone is you. Some people have bad knees, some people have arthiritis, some people need balance going up or down steep hills. Use your brain.

Tbdesu it’s super easy to overlook. Any reviews you see probably don’t mention it. I’m not sure why, they just generally don’t. And you wouldn’t notice the lower loop because it’s tucked out of the way.

When you get to a stretch of a hike where they’re not needed (like a road walk or something), it’s super convenient. You might think the poles get in the way of your arm or something, but they just don’t. Same for an umbrella, and umbrellas excel in the Deep South, with its retarded scattered storms during hot weather.

And you can rest your hand in your trekking pole handle like it’s the hilt of a giant broad sword.

I have hiking poles but dont use them much but i twisted my ankle and hurt my knee a little bit a few days ago so i will be using them when im healed up

Glen Van Peski carries trekking poles. He does cut the straps off to save grams.

What’s the longest roadtrip you’ve done so far? I’m thinking of an 8 hour drive from where I am just to tour the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Also any good hiking suggestions for this area? I’ve already been to the Adirondacks and Smokies.

me and my dad used to go on yearly fishing trips with our boat in tow and the drive took 11-13 hours
then fishing trawlers came there and netted all the vendace so the whole big lake basically died in few years so no more trips
there were so many trawlers some people even killed themselves because there was nothing left for them and all their debt 

i would have loved to take my friends there even once when the fishing was still good

18 hours, probably a little more from Colorado mountains to Chicago This was after camping trip went sour and we needed to head home as fast as possible. I wouldn't do that again. 
But Chicago to Denver was like 16 or something and that was tolerable with stops and breaks.

I drove from Pennsylvania to Fort Ticonderoga in New York. Drove 9 1/2 hours in 1 day but the fort was very beautiful. Definitely worth the trip.

750 miles last spring is the longest I've driven each way. 
I've never hiked in the NH mountains but went to Glen Ellis Falls which was nice.

Depends on how long you’ll be there. I would recommend trying the presidential traverse for any experienced backpacker. Once you get above the tree line shit is like New Zealand

I do several 20+ hour drives each year to get to different sailboat races. For other out activities usually 3-5 hours is my limit for a weekend trip with 8-12 hours being worth it if I get 3-4 days of activity. In my mind I try to keep a 2:1 ratio of activity to driving if that makes sense. It also helps to see the driving as part of the marathon and not a separate thing that gets you to/from the place you're going. For those sailboat events it really sucks if you finish the last race and your mind goes into "done" mode, gotta keep it in a we still got journey to go otherwise the drive really sucks.

"whats the longest road trip done so far?" 
Lol-- in a single burst? like not touching a destination? round trip? longest time "on the road" was last year. 25,000 miles - or 40,000 KM. not a trucker either. all done on 2 wheels. 2 sets of tires- 2 chains, 2 sets of brake pads. 2 clutch levers, 3 clutch cables [couldnt get the right lever, the lever perch kept destroying clutch cables] 5 oil changes with filter. idk how much in gas... lol I was getting about 43MPG average. average speed a comfy 75mph.

It's funny when I talk about driving 8 hours like it is nothing.. because I often do 8 hour days. People complain about driving 3 hours and for me it's like just another day. some shit is pretty boring NGL. just think i10 through west texas... LOL I'm getting ready to do some crazy rides one day.. I wanna do Mexico- to Argentina. North Africa- to the horn of Africa. Full loop around Australia.. probably my top 3 big trips that I'm pretty ready for after all these years and MANY miles under my belt. 

But im no trust fund kid- and that shits $$$ no matter if you're sleeping in the dirt or not.

Did about 4800km in Australia over a month. Wouldn't mind doing the whole lap around the place one day. Think that's something more like 15,000. Hardly got off the east coast really. Went from adelaide up to the murray river and along that, through the snowies then up the coast to daintree. Neat to go through so many different climates and saw a lot of cool spots

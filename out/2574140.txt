I’m buying a Hobie Getaway tomorrow. Assuming it looks to be in as excellent of a condition it’s advertised as (my buddy and I both know how to thoroughly inspect a sailboat) we plan on sailing across the gulf stream from Miami to Bimini. We’re both experienced sailors and of course will bring all the safety gear (one sat phone each connected to our PFD’s and carrying a EPIRB). But is it as retarded of an idea as it sounds? It’s only about 60 miles and it’s in a high traffic area. Boomer salts seem to jeer at the thought of it. 

I watched Sam Holmes expedition on YouTube doing the same thing and he had a way shittier boat that was falling apart. Talk me out of it.

They don't go to windward very well. A monohull will point higher, but is not as fast. Cats are great on a broad reach, but they can't sail as close to the wind as monohulls..

Sam Holmes is kind of an idiot, but idiots do dumb stuff all the time and only sometimes die because of it. You're the only one that can judge if the risk is worth the experience and if your experience level and preparation are sufficient. Natives crossed way longer distances in dugout canoes, but it's a safe bet that a huge number of them also drowned trying it.

Generally true but not a rule, they just don't tend to be designed with the features that make close hauled performance good like deep daggerboards and low freeboard. Also the faster you go the more the apparent wind angle shifts so at high speeds it's better to use a broad tack even if you can point closer, which is obviously comes up more often for cats than monohulls.

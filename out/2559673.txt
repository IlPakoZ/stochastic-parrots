what's especially manly about this? he's hiding in a tree throwing a spear, might as well shoot it with a gun at that point.

I fucking hate these videos. Guys in their mid-life crisis sitting in a tree until they can drop a sharp object on an animal, then strutting around like they're the reincarnation of the first caveman to take a mammoth down with his teeth. Lame shit.

let me guess, you spear it then have to find it and shoot it with a 700express ultramagnum revolver

Itâ€™s a 900lb bear and if he missed and pissed it off it would maul him to death

I was impressed. I feel the risk reward was something else

It would be one thing if a dude speared a bear by himself and didn't film it or brag about it. But this cunt filmed it, bragged about it, and is making money by bragging about it on jewtube. Where I'm from that's called a "douche".

>throw spear at bear
>it looks up and can't see shit because the dude is hiding like a queer in a tree nest
>bear probably assumes a stick fell or something and goes back to whatever it was doing, but if spots strange animal in tree it most likely just runs away
spearing bears like this isn't higher risk reward than shooting it, considering it would likely just run the fuck away from either scenario, the only difference is he can put that he "speared" it and the bear suffers more than a gunshot.

when I someone says they "speared a grizzly bear", the first thing that comes to mind for me is a fucking melee fight, not hiding like a faggot in a treehouse throwing spears at bears distracted by bait

Did he knap a spear point or smelt native copper and hammer it into a spear point? No. Did he climb a tree and stand on a branch, and maybe use a hide rope for a lifeline? No. Now even if he did these things he's still a compleate shithead for posting it on the internet. I respect people who hunt dangerous game in a way that gives the animal a solid chance and isn't done for "like and subscribe".

i'd say it's a little more gutsy to go in the middle of the everglades barefoot and spear a feral hog (can't find the vid it used to be on yt)
anyways i'd like to try eating grizzly bear, i wonder what their steaks taste like

>>2559673 (OP)
guy is a complete pussy, could of killed the bear as painlessly as possible but had to use a spear from a treehouse like a 5 year old
--- 2560526
>>2559673 (OP)
Might as well just drop a bomb on it and the bear would have the exact same chance.

He didn't post it or have a channel. Some other guy did

I support any dangerous interaction with animals so that I can watch for my viewing pleasure. Never had anything scary happen to me with an animal, kind of want it to happen. All these animals are fucking pussies I wanna kill a bear with a knife or have a wolf try to eat me or something

you do not hunt
you eat dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets from horrific factory farms, and talk about "manhood" and "fairness"
kill yourself

been vegan for years, healthier than i was when i ate meat, go /out/ more and feel a better connection to nature when i do. that guy is not a symbol of manhood, he is a pussy, there is no need to hunt like that. that is an incredibly inefficient way to hunt an animal.

imagine being pathetic enough to defend this

keep trying to find that 'essential american soul' one cock at a time fag. since we are quoting d.h. lawrence, here is some good others from your favourite writer:

"I should like to know why nearly every man that approaches greatness tends to homosexuality, whether he admits it or not...."

 "I believe the nearest I've come to perfect love was with a young coal-miner when I was about 16."

go back to /lgbt/

>>2560787
not posting my average/normal body, this isn't /fit/. i was unhealthy when i ate meat and now i eat healthier, not a far fetched concept at all

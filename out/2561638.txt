Canada or Alaska would be ok desu, since it's so vastly populated

No, you can only take three deer a year.
No, you have to enter a state lottery to even get al oicense to get a mountain goat.
No, you can only take 25 Silverbacks a year.

Don't think that you are unregulated because you are in Alaska, chud.

It's true, there are regulations and some are really cutting into your daily life.
I don't think there are places left where anyone can simply live off the land legally.

Don't cry anon, in less than 200 years there will be no meaningful life in the oceans, all mammals larger than a rat are dead and insect population has been reduced by 90%. At the same time the shareholder value will go up.

Born to early to roam the galaxy, to late to be truly free.

>Mima Mounds
>uninhabited area
kek, it's like a 30 min drive from the state capital, I mean it's rural and there's a lot of /out/ out there, but it's pretty much a mix of farmland, low density industrial/commercial with a wide swings of redneck trailer clusters and gentrified estates.

I misunderstood. I thought it was if you could turn an area into an uninhabited place, what would you pick.

>>2562043
Not allowed to just build a shack an live off the land. You have to be owner of the land and native and you have to have a building permit that proves how you deal with fecal matter and so on.

There no truly free places anymore, don't kid yourselves, guys. The dream is over.

The whole "without gubberment interference" thing is gonna be impossible, but if you can swing it, any large tropical island is your best bet. The hardest thing about this will be gaining the trust of the locals because if you don't you'll be dead quick.

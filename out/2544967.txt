Went on my first hike with a group on strangers I met on facebook. I hated it. Is this supposed to be more fun alone?
--- 2544970
>>2544967 (OP)
>I hated it
why did you hate it?
--- 2544971
It's because they were strangers. Hiking with close friends is fun but for me hiking alone is the best experience. Everyone is different.
--- 2544977
I used to hike alone fairly regularly. it was fun because i could go where io wanted to go, didn't have to worry about tother peoples schedules, or hiking pace, or anything.
hiking alone, at a brisk pace, i would pretend I was Strider, the wild and dangerous ranger from the north, on a special mission for the Elven Lords.
or i would pretend I was an agile wood elf, lightly travelling along making almost no noise, disturbing no woodland life and moving without strain or effort because of my wood natural elf abilities
--- 2544978
>>2544970
Because they kept stopping for pictures and the girls would do cringy faces and poses every couple minutes. Also some people brought their dogs, and they wouldn't stop talking, it was horrible.
--- 2544981
>>2544978
ok. yeah i wouldn't like that at all either. i would rather be hiking alone at that point.
--- 2544982
I went for a five hour hike alone last week and saw one other person the entire time I was walking. it was bliss.

I ran a backpacking MeetUp group with over 120 members for a few years. Hiking with strangers is a completely different experience. If you’re not a “people person” then don’t do it. You have to really enjoy the company of others for it to be worth your while, as there are a lot of downsides.

--- 2545002
>>2545001
that's literally not what the OP said, you dingelberry
--- 2545003
>>2544989
This is why I don't plan on ever doing a guided mountaineering expedition. Having to be around strangers for an extended length of time sounds like hell to me when I am used to doing everything on my own terms. If this means that I'll never get to climb technical or higher altitude mountains, so be it.
--- 2545020
>>2544978

If the talking gets to you (It gets to me as well) go by yourself. 
Really, you're not going to change some people.
--- 2545060

i will go with you and i promise i'll march to the summit in complete silence

--- 2545073
This girl I like has been asking me to take her out on a hike and I really want to fuck her but don't know if her cooter will get too stinky after an hour of hiking. She's pretty easy to impress considering I took her out to a nearby river where I usually fish and she couldn't stop smiling and taking pictures like she's never seen a river before. I assume if I show her some elevation her pussy will get really wet and she'll be horny for some dick.
--- 2545083
>>2545003
You don't need guides to climb difficult things. You just start with easier things and slowly work your way up as opposed to just paying someone to drag you up something hard with little experience.
--- 2545103
>>2545073
No, you absolutely only can touch cooters less than 4 minutes 32 seconds after they've been washed, after that cooters become too stinky. If hiking, it will be more like 3 minutes 28 seconds. If she hasn't washed the cooter within that time period it will be too stinky. Even more so she's very easily impressable, which means the cooter will get wet and become stinky even sooner. So you'd have around 2 minutes 14 seconds to fuck the cooter before it's too stinky for you to fuck.
--- 2545114
>>2545070
It absolutely could be, sure. The hikes we organized were loosely categorized by difficulty. On the easier hikes you’d have people of all age groups (though generally over 35) and walks of life. The longer or more difficult stuff was basically the same core group of maybe a dozen people, all somewhat younger. 

On a group hike people end up hiking in smaller groups or pairs, or alone, and just meeting up when everyone stops for a break. You can try to stay together, but it doesn’t really work out. I mean you’re not like miles apart, but you’re certainly not one mass of people either. You’ll definitely be socializing at camp, even if you’re not set up near each other (logistics don’t always work out for everyone to be right next to each other). 

But yeah, if you’re a socially awkward weirdo (you’re on 4Chan, so probably) I say go for it. If nothing else you can troll the group with your weirdness.

>yoga pants
Shorts and leggings are a great combination, especially when protection from abrasion isn’t needed (like on an established hiking trail). They keep you warm and dry very quickly. It’s basic athletic wear.

Honestly, people who don’t like people shouldn’t go outside, you should knit or play WOW. People are cool, they make things better, sounds like you missed out on making friends. You should do it again but pull the stick out of your ass first, if you need it back in there you can find a new one on your hike.mvxht2

--- 2546279

It's more fun with someone you enjoy being around and talking to. Alone is okay as well, but it can get lonely. I can't imagine why anyone would want to hike with a group of strangers though. Seems like it could go wrong in so many different ways.
--- 2547471
>>2545073
You normally don't have to worry about smell unless you're doing it doggy style, then everything starts stinking if they haven't washed. My buddy used to use a finger swipe test and sniff his finger to see if it was worth going after. If it were me just tell her to hold on to a tree and hit it from behind, eating pussy onatrail is a pretty cuck move, fine if you're in the bed but not when you're manning up and leading the way.

In first year University, actually the second week there, we had a camping trip for Terrestrial Ecology (plus some other people), it was like 30-40 people that barely knew each other at some Cabin in the mountains owned by the University. Profs stayed inside while everyone tented in the woods.

I'll look at Meetup hike listings occasionally, there's a high number of them within an hours drive. Most of the people are pretty old around here, in their 50s. Won't see many women under 30... One time I signed up early for a hike as a lark, and a Korean in her 20s signed up after me. She was too much of a vax'd normie for my taste, but it was flattering to know that you convinced someone to come for a hike. She let me give her a ride back to the train station and a hug...
Let 'em come to you, that's the right way.

Advice for life

If she's a true 6/10 or above she won't stink. If literally anything makes her a 5/10 or under she can stink. Every beautiful women I've been with has smelled amazing and isn't a ding ding and will take care of themselves.

Unless you're a dingle yourself you know when they naturally can't help it. If a chick or even you yourself comes back from the gym yeah you're not gonna smell the best. But I have a feeling you're talking about girls that straight up don't wash their bodies, that's a 5/10 at best and you can tell by their personalities or looks. It's honestly simple as that. 

For reference 6/10 is the majority of cute girls. They're wifey material potentially. 5/10's are girls who don't fix their teeth, weight, acne etc. Nothing necessary wrong with it but you're average at best at that point ya dig?

Yes. Going with people ruins immersion. Also “hiking groups” are full of social media normies that care more about updating their snapchat/facebook/twitter profiles for updoots rather than actually enjoying the hiking experience.

The chance of a wolf or a bear fucking with you is basically zero. Carry bear spray if you're that worried about it.

You can hate idiots without being a misanthrope. The worst is when some idiot constantly complains about his feet hurting because he just bought new shoes.

Hey at least you tried, partying up with randos to any activity is always a hit or miss. Just do some solo hikes, maybe ask that facebook group about other good trails to check out. Maybe someone from that group will be more like you and also prefer to hike without the stopping, talking and dogs.

I want to start doing overnight hiking - what do I need for this? obviously water, snacks, and a tent... but where the hell can I pitch my tent? just anywhere?

in the woods, preferably in a national park or national forest, or state forest or even a county park. preferably inna woods and preferably near a fresh water source like a river or strong running creek, or stream, tributary, rivulet or the like

I have used pretty much exclusively sleeping bags but I've heard some good things about quilts. Which one do you use?

Bag. I dont see the purpose of a quilt other than its different and youtubers can make clickbait videos saying youve been missing out this whole time.

Quilt are only really comfortable in good weather above freezing and the weight difference is negligible so don't waste your money on one.

If it's cold, there's no substitute for a nice snuggly bag. However, when the overnight temp is over about 7C I'm perfectly happy with a decent blanket.

Barrel bag left 3/4 open. If it gets cold, zip it up.

both

but sleeping bag is better intrinsically since it traps air in while a quilt can come undone in the middle of the night and create a heat-breech

if you want to minmax the goose down insulation just shake your bag so all the insulation accrues on top of you.
--- 2571839
Both have their place.
I personally prefer mummy bags for cowboy camping since you can sinch them up tight and breath warmed air that has been around your body. (Don't do this with a down bag because the insulation will start to collapse) 
I usually carry a quilt though because it is warmer at any given weight. 
If you can only buy one get a quilt and wear a hat to bed.

Been using a Taiga 5c quilt since November and I love it. I’ve used it cowboy camping like 20 times and I’ve actually been sleeping in it on top of my bedsheets ever since (I know I’m weird)

yall cant be this stupid right?

Are you using 'cowboy camping' to mean just sleeping in the open, or do you actually sleep next to a fire with a mummy bag?
--- 2572741
>>2572739
The sparks from the fire help heat the synthetic material, and the smell of burning plastic keeps coyotes away

If you sleep in a bag you are probably a female or at least an MtF tranny on hormones.

i use a quilt down to around 20 F. I like the extra room. Winter camping I use the sleeping back because its warmer.

What temperature rating of a sleeping bag should I get if it gets consistently to 30-35°F at night?
--- 2573127
>>2573097
20F, or get a liner
--- 2573169
>>2573097
Yeah, near freezing there's a lot that can make it cooler like humidity and wind. Go with at least something comfort rated at 30F or limit rated at 20F. Suspect that at those temps you'll have a jacket or fleece if needed.

If you're using a quilt instead of a sleeping bag (rather than as part of a hammock setup) it's for saving weight. It's only half the width of the unzipped sleeping bag, but usually with a full toe box.

You can wear clothes or throw a blanket over if it gets colder

I use the enigma quilt, -17 celsius version.
Tested to be comfortably warm at -1 C. I bought it because the open back makes it easier to turn around and switch position, which I do a lot before I fall asleep.
--- 2573374
I have an enlightened quilt and it's super warm, but bc down compresses I pack it down and take it with me when I absolutely know I need to spend a night, otherwise i have a snugpak jungle bag in my day bag.

it sucks bc down is great, but I like having all of my shit in one bag ready to go at any time

20F

10F if you get a lot of wind, rain, and humidity and you want to stay out for more than a week.

In the summer I just sleep out on my coat, in winter a blanky for my feet and wrap myself in a tarp when its windy. I'm a desert nigga though.

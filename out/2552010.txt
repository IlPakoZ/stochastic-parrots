BPS Adventurer. Great knife, and because they are made in Ukraine I suspect they are being subsidized for export so they are available far cheaper than they should be. For $40 you get a quality knife, very quality sheath, and ferro rod.

Looks nice, though the stand with ukraine shit on their site is gay and their use of 1066 instead of something similar to 1095 is questionable on their smaller fixed blades
--- 2552038

Never been to their website, bought off Amazon cheap and will do so until Wagner storms their factory and loots all the goods.
>their use of 1066 instead of something similar to 1095 is questionable
I mean sure, but I doubt any human being would be able to tell a 1060 knife from 1095 knife after a day of slicing wood or whatever. 10XX steel doesn't matter on a bush knife, it matters on a chef knife or a thin sword.
--- 2552042
>>2552038
The main difference is in toughness and edge retention. And while you can't really tell the toughness of a knife until you eventually break it, the difference between edge retention becomes apparent when you use em for a bit. Even with 1075 you'll find yourself having to touch up the edge more often than 1095, and while that's a worthwhile trade-off when it comes to larger knives, it's wasted on smaller ones
>10XX steel doesn't matter on a bush knife, it matters on a chef knife or a thin sword.
How exactly? Also who uses 10 series carbon steels for kitchen knives?

Really? I find em quite comfy, and I wear medium sized gloves. Plus them being a little oversized is a good thing for when you use em with thick gloves on. To each their own though, no problem with not being a fan of budget swedish knives

got a victorinox forester, basically the same thing - absolutely love it for an outdoors knife. can't say i've ever had an issue with the handle size on moras, fits my medium hands absolutely fine and probably more comfortable than most other knives. 
got a bk10 as well, works well as a knife but i'm not sure about the handles and the sheath isn't great but strapped onto a pack it's not a huge deal.
--- 2552175

Toughness is defined in ASTM D5801-12. The main contributors to Toughness are material type and annealing method. Edge retention is mostly a byproduct of hardness--ASTM E18-22. Both toughness and hardness should be consistent by manufacturer--zero guess work.
Fun fact--most knife manufacturers use what is cheap and easy to make not what is best... for example you don't see a lot of stainless knifes from custom knife makers because it is much harder to work with and the annealing is more difficult--not because it isn't superior to carbon steel. The carbon steel my persists because it is easier for noobs to sharpen.

from a practical view point, the 1066 is tougher than 1095, heat treated to the same hardness the 1066 will bend where the 1095 would break, though the 1095 will hold an edge longer than the 1066, both are practical steels and easy to sharpen in the field should it become necessary. 

For the money it's a fine knife.
--- 2553545
>>2552222
I use the small Esee instead of the box cutter because the sheath is less noticeable on my belt, no folding or opening like a utility knife, and it takes a good edge and holds it for awhile while box cutters are super super sharp and will slice the tip of your finger off before they’re completely dull and useless 5min later. Esee also makes a decent small pry bar or spudger when needed and box cutters snap.

What you have to realize, is just how small that guys dick really is. It's basically a clitoris with a urethra routed through it.

I took the ESEE pill, since you liked it so much, but I found the candiru just a bit too small. I basically use the Izula or a spyderco, depending on if I'm at work or not. (I work in the federal govt and the spyderco is less likely to get me questioned, since it's less visible stowed.)

Fun fact, the official Danish scout knife, is pretty much a copy of the Buck, a little shorter, without the fuller or more "combat knife type guard"
and a slightly thinner blade, its called a Vangedal if anyone would be interested in that
grandpa had one, mom had one, now i have all of them, good times

they do have this weird thing, where there is a rifle stud on the belt loop, that goes into the handle, on the other side of the snap you can see in the front on some models

Thanks, brudder! They actually seem awesome. Aesthetic and functional. I'll check them out for sure. Thanks for the tip!
--- 2556837
>>2556832
look into their Senior models, or the Rover
but im pretty sure they are unobtainium outside Denmark, here you can see the hole the stud in the sheath fits into, never seen that on any other knife, also, they are intentionally made with pretty poor "quality" leather, not that its even close to bad, but its leather that is meant for you to treat it, leather fat, leather fat, leather fat, until it goes naturally brown unlike many modern dyed leather sheaths, which is kinda refreshing, this makes me wanna buy a new one too and actually take care of it!

Yes, it just looks nice. Can you process an animal with? Then it's good.
--- 2557591
>>2557485
I own both in carbon and stainless.
From left to right: HD stainless, HD carbon, standard stainless, and standard carbon.
For me, HD moras are the obvious choice, mainly due to the slightly more obtuse edge grind. I've had problems with the standard mora rolling its edge during fairly normal "bushcraft" use. The standard mora has a 22-degree edge, whereas the HD mora has a 27-degree edge, making it more robust.
If you live in a wet climate, I'd recommend the HD in stainless steel; if you live in a dry climate, I'd recommend the HD in carbon steel because rust will not be an issue. Plus, the carbon steel version is easier to sharpen.
I live in a wet climate, so my pick is the HD in stainless. Great knoife.

Not sure, but I like the dual grind. Front is very slicey (tomatoes, peel apples etc) and the back end bites into wood nicely (obviously since it is classic Scandi). No hot spots in the handle at all. Well worth the ~$30
The Cold Steel Pocket Bushman is also a great, lightweight beast that should be in everyones pack.

I have the #4 survival. Good knife, beautiful and feels good in the hand. But I have to admit I'm kinda disappointed in the cheaper carbon steel that it's made with. It doesn't hold a great edge. It stays sharp with minimal maintenance, but the razor sharp edge you get after a strop vanishes almost immediately upon using it. It also rusts very easily so you need to keep it oiled at all times.

I have also had pic related in my pocket for the past two years and it has never let me down. Their stainless steel seems better than their carbon steel.
--- 2559025

Nice Quartermaster's Knife. Is it a vintage Catteraugus?
Also, what's the story on the Jet Pilot's Survival knife?
--- 2562485
>>2562306
The hell is that piece of steel stuck to the back of the axe head? Oh btw, nice shiv you forged.
--- 2562517
>>2562310
I picked up the Catteragus from some boomers gunshop many years ago, it was super rusted out but I cleaned it up and its served me ever since.
and the jet pilots knife I'm guessing you mean the one with the cork handle that is super shiny, not much of a story on that one, I got it at a local army surplus store in russia near my grandparents village.

>>2562485
as for that hunk of steel, its basically a hammer head used to drive pieces of wood into a log to split it down the middle, Its a Finnish lumber axe. Heres a good informational video that talks more about the design

Nice score.
Yes, I was talking about the cork handle one. It looks a lot like the Randall Jet Pilot SK. Letters F, LL, and NN in pic rel.

what are some good sharpening tools or systems that do not require you to commit hours of your time learing how to compulsively rub steel on rocks in a precise and repeatable way? I just want sharpen knives with as little guess work as possible

--- 2565174
>>2565166
why would you buy a mora for that much money? The whole point of a mora is that it's decent quality and CHEAP. If you have money to burn on nice knives that you don't really need there are way better options.

I use OPs mora every day in the garden because I'm a professional garden. 
Water proof handle is very good also when steralizing blade, sheath very good, knife cheap enough to replace as needed without asstears.

Buy orange colour so not losing knife. No sitting on camouflage knife
--- 2565567
>>2565166
Anon. You've bought a knife that's been rehandled with wood and paid more for it than my boots are worth. 
For what purpose? Cardboard cutting?

Morakniv is like jhonny Walter whiskey, trying to buy the more expensive one is a scam. Cringe acting

This is good advice. I have the green one and after about two trips out I had to put blaze orange tape on the scabbard.

A or U are the most versatile in your collection.
picrel: all you will ever need. The Ranger skinner is also an amazing herbalist knife and is perfect for cleaning Dungeness crab and fiash (only idiots don't take the organs out of crab before cooking).

Because most of their blade designs aren't practical and they use a lower grade steel. You also are paying for the brand name and the mystique. They're like ford--most of there products are boomer crap but there are some absolute gems if you know what to look for.

That sounds right, I know the manufacturering process involes vacuum inert gas atomization. It can be forged, not just used as a coating. I see it in high end kitchen knives.

If your using it to gut creatures to cook get a full tang. Folders are shit for processing meat because they get Offal in the folding part and are hard to clean. Folder handels also suck, ergonomically, compared to folders (especially for skinning knives).
Full tang blades are also usually thicker and can take more abuse.

Any store that is a Buck dealer can get one on order for you. Knife center will ship internationally and to PO boxes.
--- 2566198

--- 2566205

--- 2566211

Its quite sharp though hard to sharpen. Opens boxes and cuts chord; roots; branches and dirt, I'm sure you can batton with it but why.
--- 2566214
>>2566198
Because I like buck 110
--- 2566215
>>2566214
To clarify, it's small but heavy-ish for its size
--- 2566217
Plus you can just buy another knife if for some reason you need full tang

You don't take care of your shit and are clearly retarded. From harvesting herbs and mushrooms to gutting animals: non idiots field clean their shit before sheathing it and finish cleaning it when they get home.

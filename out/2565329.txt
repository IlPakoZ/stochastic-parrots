I live in the Midwest United States near Lake Michigan; what are these random sparse trypophobic holes I see in patches of grass?

>aerating lawns
What the fuck is up with you burgers? Every week I find out some new weird thing you're doing
--- 2565370
>>2565363
But anon, you're American.

I am an American who grew up and lives in the suburbs and even I find the lawn cult of America to be strange.

This.

We have these things called yards, part of our property because many of us don’t live in commie blocks or shitty flats like Yurop.

Never seen anybody aerate the lawn in Florida though. I forgot about that since I left the Midwest. The grass down here is much different and the soil is super sandy

My family emigrated to Montana way back, my great grandfather was born there, but I'm fully Norwegian

>>2565388
I guess it's just something for upper middle class people to spend their time and money on

>>2565393
We have gardens too, I don't live in a commieblock hellscape, I live in a small town where everyone has their own garden

I spent 3 years at my house maintaining a lush green lawn, and even set up a patch with shorter denser grass to be like a golf green. When i switched to native planting, i enjoyed my yard much better, and spending my time taking care of it was much more fun. Still kept most of the grass but let clover, dandelions, and wildflowers spread everywhere. Had so much wildlife for those couple years before selling. It was amazing.

I am 75% norwegian, 25% scottish, however my male lineage goes back to a boat that came to America in 1630, there were numerous scientific advancements thanks to my family that you benefit from on a daily basis, my parents are from oregon and michigan and I live in the south. I may not be fully norwegian, but I have been in America for 400 years and still retain a very very high amount of it for such a timespan.

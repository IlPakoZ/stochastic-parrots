My family owns this literal plot of dirt in the middle of California and I was hoping to visit there for about a day and a half. Ive been camping before, but wanted to do it just to give myself some time to think without all of the noise(yes, I know that sounds generic as fuck). 

Im somewhere in the middle where I wont need a whole lot since its just for 1 night and I shouldnt go overboard with supplies, but I still wanted to get more out of it than just sitting in my car. As for essentials, all I have is a sleeping bag and some Huel dried stuff. So Im debating getting a tent, chair, and stove + any other utensils. Will probably pick up some fire wood then a few gallons of water for myself and the dehydrated food. I could just bring some protein bars, but I'd like to actually cook some meals if possible. My reasoning is that Im hoping to use all of the equipment again soon, but again, I don't want to go overboard for my first time.

Bring a slingshot and a 6-pack for shooting the cans.
Have fun, Anon.

if your family owns land, you should camp on it more frequently. Many years back my wife bought some land outside Lassen NP in northern CA near the Nevada border. We didn't start exploring it until the c00f happened. It's fun to camp/hike on long weekends. We usually bring as much junk as we can fit into our car since car camping is meant to be 'comfy'. Anyways, bring entertainment like a book or portable gaming system or anything to keep you distracted. /out/ nights can be very long if you aren't used to sleeping outside.

Yeah I was hoping to bring some books to read since this was also gonna be a dopamine detox type thing too. Other weekends Im probably gonna do more fun shit especially with friends.

Now I regret not buying that slingshot when passing through Nampa, ID a few months back

Honestly if I do an overnighter, I would just pick up food on the way there and eat it at camp. You should plan more trips to your land. I'm looking at buying some acres out in the desert once in the near future. If I had my own land I'd be there 1-2 times a month to get away from it all. Build a shade structure and a out house and you're gonna love your stay

I was thinking I could just bring some canned food, but thats not as fun IMO. Also one of the bigger issues with the land is that its about a 5 hour drive 1 way and the cost of gas in that alone would be more than yearly property taxes. 
My buddies have tried to convince me to build a simple structure, but It would stick out like a sore thumb and could probably be seen for miles(even a 7x7x7 wooden box) and Im afraid some meth heads might fuck with it or try to squat there.
Another thing is that Im probably gonna go next weekend now since theres gonna be a heatwave this weekend and will be about 25 degrees cooler next week.

a dugout is nice and low profile, as well as capable of some natural insulation. you don't have to worry about methheads unless you are less than 3 miles from a liquor store. getting a shipping container with a padlock on it should be enough, and cost about as much as a shed there.

Yeah I don't get the dried food as the main course for one night. Bring a steak in a cooler along with some powered mashed potatoes and a can of vegetables.

The property is just a slight bit off a highway, but in an area mostly uninhabited. My dad left some junk on that property for years and it wasnt surprising to see most of it was gone after a few years, or casually strewn across the valley. Im not particularly upset or anything, but even checking up on it once every few month may be a bit of a stretch, and it really just takes some randos to see it unattended more than once to either squat or take whatevers in there. Im not saying Im gonna leave a flatscreen or gold bars there, but I'd rather just have some peace of mind knowing nobody would fuck with it and I dont have to constantly check up on it. Then again, I could just be over thinking it.
My buddies talked about getting a bunch of pallets to make a shit shack basically for shade. Maybe that would be a great place to start to see if I come back and its burned down or full of bullet holes and beer cans.

Would like to do something like this but not my first time, just so I know what to expect. Ive also found that you can heat up some chili and put it into a a carton of Idaho Spuds dried hash browns for a more filling hot meal if you dont want to get too into it for a meal.

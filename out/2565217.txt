Any other anons working and living on a rural farm? How do you entertain your free time?
The place I'm at it's pretty much all farmland with some small, forested spots and it's as flat as flat can be. There are no rivers or lakes nearby either.

Prairies are a great place to forage
Saskatoons, wild plums and cherries
Most of the abandoned yards have an orchard
Lots of mushrooms and herbs
Great hunting
Gardening is good too
--- 2565333
No but if I was you, I'd see where I can ride a dirt bike or ATV 

Unlike with boomers, it's cool for younger dudes to tow with cars, and still rock little 80cc 2 strokes and 125cc dirt bikes.

Me? I like 1/24 scale rc rock crawlers

I work and live on a very rural farm, lucky enough to have a river run through it. I like to spend my free time:
Fishing 
Walking in the woods (mushroom hunting, critter spotting, sign-reading etc)
Bicycling to the mountains and back
Hunting 
Doing personal projects around the farm
Working out in the barn 
Reading books 
And obviously browsing image board

This question is the hardest one to answer for everybody

how do we regain the process of life before computers and internet?... how do we go back to the analog golden era? 

perhaps you might keep an outsider to land you phisical comics, books, dvds, etc 

someone that you trust that can pick based and decent content without any political propaganda etc etc so that you don't get in touch with modernity 

but here goes my best answer:

>friends irl
>riding bikes like the other anon sugested
>going out to swim 
>camping
>start an active hobbie (draw, carpentry, gardening, fighting etc etc)

the hardest part for me is 
>if you need to pass time when you're bored and lazy how you deal with it because this is when shit will hit the fan and you'll end up in the PC roting again

what % of your time you do all that and what % you keep browsing?
--- 2565545
>>2565366
>Walking in the woods
I do that and I run too but it's a small area.

>Bicycling to the mountains and back
No mountains but I do bike
>Hunting
Not a possibility

>Doing personal projects around the farm
>Working out in the barn
Not a possibility since it's not my farm, I'm just a peasant temporary worker.

>>2565390
>Dvd
I don't have a tv.

>>friends irl
My friends are at home, I moved to a rural farm abroad.
>>going out to swim
No waterways.

>>start an active hobbie (draw, carpentry, gardening, fighting etc etc)
If I were talented then drawing or writing could work but I'm a artlet. As for building stuff or gardening it's not my property so I can't do that. 

For now I read, shitpost, run, ride bike, do calisthenics and sleep a lot but days are getting longer and warmer and I need more activities to keep going.

You pick up hobbies. Learn how to make stuff, be it clothes, knives, or tables. Learn how to forage wild edibles and learn how to cook with them. Learn how to hunt.

>>2565545
>Hunting
>Not a possibility

Why not? Do the land owners not want you hunting there or are you some sort of vegan hippy fag?
--- 2565606

Yeah, I'll just ask my employer to provide me a workshop so I can do that.
--- 2565607
>>2565606
Why would you need a workshop to make things? Those were just examples off the top of my head. There are many other things you could make.

You know I can tell you're a PMSing roastie by your indignant response to someone genuinely trying to help you.

One thing i have realized is that it takes a lot of hours and attention to make food the ol way from scratch like jam, sauerkraut, sourdough and such other traditional food from my cunt. So if you choose to you end up spendign a lot of the day doing that. But lemme tell you it is worth every hour because it ends up being so delicious

They don't get on me here and I live in the south with decent amount of livestock, I've only been bitten by horsefly a dozen or so times in my life. I also don't have problems much with mosquitos despite there being a ton around here, though they used to tear me up and swarm me.

I've been working on a remote dairy farm for a bit over 5 years, but I have my own house and garden close to a river which changes things. Aside from kayaking and fishing I got really into archery, vegetable gardening, stargazing and astro-photography, and a lot of reading instead of watching TV or sitting in front of a computer. The gardening has been great because the local store doesn't have a lot of fresh food that isn't just meat or dairy, and sometimes a nigga needs salad ingredients. Also got into baking bread for the same reason. How long are you staying on the farm for? Do you have your own kitchen or are you sharing with the owners?
>Yeah, I'll just ask my employer to provide me a workshop
I did exactly that when I first started my job. They already had a workshop full of tools and I just asked to use it. I rummaged around the piles of scrap metal and broken machinery and put together pieces that would make a great outdoor oven but I didn't know how to weld. I told them about my idea and they excitedly taught me how to weld like it was no chore for them. This one old guy who never had any kids of his own was more than happy to teach me a skill and get a bit creative himself while making the scrap pile smaller

>>2565366
Mein neger. My critter game is out of control with birds. I've become a Disney Princess to the point where they harass me if I'm not awake by my usual work times on the weekend. Parrots screeching and clinging to the fly screen outside my bedroom window and staring through the crack in the blinds with beady little eyes

>>2565955
Dasitmane. Even doing things like making pizza bases can be extremely satisfying when you don't have access to takeaway food

Not that anon but "farmstay" might be similar to "woofing"? In short, some farmers offer backpackers free lodging and meals in exchange for them doing farm work. There's no exact rules about it (other than it's possibly illegal in my country) cont...

Cont sorry. Ran out of space. Thanks for reading my blog:

Farmstays could be 50/50 an amazing time with lonely but chill old folks who just want to show you their animals and crops and hang out, or they can be awful shitty slave drivers who want free labor in exchange for a roof over their head. At my work we had a young girl from Singapore who just milked cows in the mornings and afternoons monday to friday and still got paid a wage, and got fed, and got housed at the owner family's house where they did her laundry and everything. Gave her a shitty old car to go off and explore on the weekends and she loved it. I loved having having an extra person there that wasn't me. She was a big help but overstayed her welcome when 3 months turned into a year and she turned into a bit of a slob.

She applied for exactly the same job on the other side of the country for a higher pay, got it straight away, and was picked up from the airport and driven 8 hours into the middle of desolation. Her job was to do the whole family's laundry, cook all the meals, feed silage to the ~1000 head of cattle, and tutor the couple's 3 home-schooled kids every day. There's a weird contract that shitty farmers make people sign on remote stations where "your wage is this, but you only get paid if you work until this date" where they pay out in one lump sum with the hope of luring you back for another year.

Be really careful with farmstays or woofing anons and do your research

Yeah having your own place is definitely a game changer and if that was the case things would be very different for the better, being able to clock off and go home would be great instead of being 24/7 on the same facilities.

>How long are you staying on the farm for?
Almost 2/3 of the year if I last that long, which I doubt because I'm struggling, people are nice but I feel like I'm too slow and I don't like being a hindrance. Also I don't have anyone to talk to since I'm a foreigner who came here alone which is fucking me up too. At this point my life is nothing but work, there's no going out with a beer with friends, there's no dating, there's no sports, nothing. I wake up, go to work, eat and sleep. Can you share a bit more about your experience prior to getting your own place? How did you cope?
>Do you have your own kitchen or are you sharing with the owners?
Shared.

Ah bummer. My situation is a bit different because I made the move permanently after getting the job in my own country. I bought an old 16ft 70's caravan to park at a paid campground with facilities for around a year before I could find a rental property. It was great because I met a bunch of backpackers who were also staying there while working on other farms, so there was always someone to drink a beer and play cards with. Your current situation sounds pretty appealing to me because I enjoy bouts of isolation and not having anyone to talk to, but it sounds like you're a lot more social than I am. If we could trade places I would happily oblige
>people are nice but I feel like I'm too slow and I don't like being a hindrance
Forget about that. I'd never driven a manual car or seen a cow up close before starting. Within a year I was doing pregnancy testing with shoulder-length gloves and driving a truck with 18 gears. People like to teach you. You aren't being a burden. Stick with it and embrace the situation while you can. Ask to use the tool shed and learn things. If you don't have any social outlets you should treat it like a monastery experience. Work hard, eat good, learn how to meditate, read, and stare at the stars for a few more months

How are you guys finding the life, I’n considering bailing on engineering to become a labourer on a farm, I feel it’ll be more fulfilling and I’d be closer to my hobbies and interests, but I recon I’d be stepping down on wages
--- 2570051
>>2569811
Damn you had a nice setup anon.
I think the hardest part is being a foreigner and not speaking more than broken words from the country I'm at now, specially when the people I interact with at work are natives themselves so makes it difficult for me to connect, but that's my fault.
I'm not really social but spending months without having any meaningful or personal conversation kinda sucks, sometimes I just feel like I want to open up and talk about how the week was or things like that.

>Forget about that
I try but it's awkward and I feel dumb when there's things happening but I don't know what to do nor do I understand what's being said so I can do things by my own. There's moments it feels like everyone is sharp as fuck and working like they're on meth and then there's me, this clueless guy.

I know this reads like a pussy venting and I apologize for it, one reads meditations and try to be as much of a stoic as possible but you can't help but feel weak. Still, another day has passed and I showed for work and didn't quit and fly back home so there's that.
Thanks for the advice and I wish you well man.

>>2569838
Make bank and work on your own land. It's honest work and when the sun is right you have moments of feeling blessed but unless you really love some aspect of the farm life there are better options.
Working with livestock might be better but doing purely agricultural shit is nothing but back breaking and minimum wage.

i had a small 2-acre vegetable farm and sold at the local markets on the weekends just a fun hobby. it was pretty fun but i realized i prefer just chilling in nature and eating wild food instead of fussing over cultivation and marketing. anyway its a good skill to develop to be able to feed yourself!

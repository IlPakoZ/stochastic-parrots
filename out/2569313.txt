Is it wise to go wild camping in a country where it's illegal?

I'm living in Germany and I really just want to sleep outside
--- 2569316
>>2569313 (OP)
According to the Europeans on this board, Germany is rife with legal camping opportunities and everything we assume is wrong.

No. Fuuuuck that. You want to go to jail for camping? Not worth it.

It's fine as long as you don't act like a retard. Don't build fires, don't litter, and you will never have any problems.

If a law is unjust you have an obligation to disobey it

I have been "wild camping" all over Germany for 15 years. No one will do anything if you stay out of sight. Nothing ever happened to me except the occasional grumpy dog walkers.
--- 2569411
>>2569313 (OP)
Bruh I've never gotten in trouble for wild camping and I've spent many a night out there. You need to leave your house and get in contact with reality. Retarded Americans really managed to brainwash your dumb ass. What do you think is going to happen if you actually camp outside? Even if you get caught, which is extremely unlikely, it's a relatively small fine. Touch grass pls.

You can sleep everywhere in Germany. Just sleep under open sky or use a small bug tent. People dont care unless you put some fat tent in the woods and live here. Works perfect from the Spring to Autumn time. Depends on the area they are also huts, those are free but depending on the time already occupied by normies (Ferienzeit ist ganz schlimm wie im Schwarzwald).

The only thing what sucks is open fire, you can quickly get in trouble with that. Fireplaces are mostly dirty as fuck. I use sometimes a cartridge grill but dont get caught, do it early in the morning and secured.
--- 2569438
>>2569411
Germans seem to have a stick up their ass so I think it's likely if caught that I would face consequences 

>>2569397
I'm in Schwarzwald so I think I could go deep and not be found. I don't think there's any animals that are too wild here

>legal camping opportunities
Yes. But have you met your average German that visits Camping sites?
They´re the worst of the worst.
If you ever ask yourself why the Germans were Nazis at one point, just visit a campingplatz.
And legal camping oppurtunities aren´t /out/. 
I go /out/ to get away from Germans, not to live among them.
--- 2569495
It's legal in Brandenburg, proving again that all other states are cucks
--- 2569497
>>2569341
I don´t get this retarded mindset.
There´s a high chance of getting caught here.
Germany is densely populated. Germans are human CCTV cameras that will report ANYTHING to the police.
The fines are around 3000€.
Why do some of you faggots LARP like you're some le super based outlaw?
"Just get thrown in jail, and pay thousand of € in fines, and get a permanent criminal record"
Just admit you´re a larping little faggot.
--- 2569499
>>2569344
Then go buy yourself some cheap property in your Balkans shithole?
I have been considering the same. Buy some cheap property in Romania or something, get a yurt, and live there on your off days.
Deutschland kannst du absolut vergessen. Drecksland, mit ner Köterrasse als Bevölkerung.
--- 2569528
>>2569497
>There´s a high chance of getting caught here.
Tell me you never go outside without telling me you never go outside. lmao
>Germans are human CCTV cameras that will report ANYTHING to the police.
Wrong. People don't care. Out of curiosity, where do you live?
>The fines are around 3000€
This is made up bullshit. Stop peddling misinformation. It's more like 70€ so basically cheaper than a Hotel. But you won't get caught anyways.
--- 2569530
>>2569438
In the Black forest you can even sleep in and around the shelter (Schutzhütten). So you really have no excuse to not go sleep outside this spring and summer.

We’ve got a ways to go; at least out west. It’s all a function of population density.

People here make fun of us rurals; but then wind up driving hours to go hiking in objectively worse spots; it’s madness.

You're better off going to Czech or France for your /out/ adventures desu. Especially in czech people are really chill and won't even mind if you sleep on their property. Germans are fucking dogs though and will literally notify police the moment they spot a backpack on you.

Germans are so cucked it's beyond ridiculous and more in the creepy shit league.

>>2569313 (OP)
Of course you can if you consider the following:
Plan your tour in less populated areas (Brandenburg, nord Hessen, Saarland, Rheinland-Pfalz). You can usually ask farmers if you can camp on their land, I've never had a problem. You can also ask the church, I did that on a small pilgrimage, it worked out well.
Have a tent in muted colours
Do not camp directly on hiking trails
If someone asks you to go, go.
In the middle of the forest, no one usually notices.
Arrive late, leave early
And take down your tent as soon as you get up.

It is important to get an overview of the area beforehand and see where you are likely to be alone.

In Germany we say something like "ignorance does not protect from punishment" cause we love punishment and denunciation.

But if you dont behave like a total retard you can camp wild and not be bothered, if you wanna be safe stay away from hunting grounds and "Naturschutzgebiete", german law grants you your right to use nature for recreation for as long as you want, so if you wanna sleep there you have a right to do so as long as its not full on "Camping", if you wanna chill in a hammock or bivy bag for a night theres not much they can do. 
Otherwise, like someone said there are some areas where you can legaly camp in a tent like a few forests in Brandenburg or the Sächische Schweiz near the czech border.
--- 2571639
If your tent has no ground, it's merely a Wetterschutz and perfectly legal, as long as it's moved every 12 hours.
Don't laugh, there's no fun in Germany!

>*laughs in 8,886,356 km2 of crown land*

if you wanna do wild camping:
 - nay sayers are your biggest problem, they will rob your confidence and spirit of adventure
 - dusk dawn and darkness are your friends: find spot at dusk, set up in darkness, wake up and pack in darkness, leave by dawn
 - specific for germany: avoid tents, embrace pad, bag, bivvy, hammock, tarp
 - learn about why people would be pissed at you for staying somewhere: at beach dunes, you could destroy vegetation that holds sand in place, which in turn protects from flooding. (therefore, dont lay on plants). in woods, if you seriously scare an animal through retarded behavior (you run away, or turn on flashlight at them), you will make them permanently leave the area. (therefore, stay still when you see one, dont walk through forest with flashlight on (just dont walk at darkness at all)).
--- 2572049
also, if you actually talk to german land owners, you'll find that their biggest concern is that if one person does it, others might get inspired and do the same, which will increase the likelihood of retards doing it (litterers, animal scarers, vegetation destroyers, people who make fires etc).

--- 2572148
Just find a nice secluded, well-covered area and set up camp. 

I'm in UK where there is limited /out/ opportunities, but I just do the above. A nice area of the woods with a dip or a fallen tree to set up my tent behind. It's not just wild camping we do, it's also stealth camping. Stealth-wild camping is the state of things.
--- 2572422
>>2572046
>spirit of adventure
An important factor. If it's not fun it's not worth any risk or loss of sleep.
>>2572148
We too enjoy stealth here in the wide open West, you don't need to be a seer to understand where things are headed. See: Oz's insane lockdown horseshit. 
Steep terrain with lots of rock makes for good hideouts. We have a few "lounges" here and there that would require a fee and a penis inspection/ permit to visit if we cared to warn our overlords. 
They rarely travel by foot in the dark.

What the fuck is going on in this picture. Is this a German permanent camp ground or something?

Set camp at sunset. Avoid emitting light. Leave early.

Who the hell have anyone power to dictate what you do in the wilderness? What kind of backward ass shit is that, this “law” of yours is government overreach at its finest. OP you are allowed to go camping by the laws of nature and you shouldn’t give a fuck about German pigs trying to squash every last ounce of spirit from you.

Rural Ausfag here. That isn't a regular thing. It was taken during the height of the first wave of covid 3 years ago where it was only in major cities with international airports. City people who were suddenly off work with a lot of free time on their hands had One Fucking Job which was to stay indoors and ride it out, not load up the kids in the caravan and go traveling around the countryside. My town of ~40 people in alpine Victoria exploded into a tent city of hundreds of clueless idiots walking around without masks, peering through the empty shop windows, and milling around the pub wondering why it wasn't open

I feel for you OP but Germany probably has reasons to crack down. There's a bit of a gypsy and "culrural enrichment" problem yeah? do what >>2569316 says and camp somewhere legal to be separated from those folks. Pay a small fee and enjoy sleeping outside while not getting stabbed
--- 2572886
>>2572865
Kek, we got the urban retards as well. 
None of us even cared about covid we just didn't want thousands of clueless faggots and nazi police running around in our back yards.

Some of us set up a checkpoint and started stopping random people and you should have seen these cars Ubolt and fuck off when they saw us.

I've spoken with strangers about what I'm doing when I've asked them to fill up my water their response was to offer me a beer or give me fruit from their garden. Country folk see laws as a suggestion at best and an affront at worst.

If you get caught you will get a fine in the worst case. It's not like it's an actual crime. I go camping everytime in Spain, and our forest aren't as thick as yours and I have never been caught.

I was rooting so hard for that guy.
Even more so when I found out he shot his girlfriend with a crossbow once.
Using your girlfriend as target practice is one of the most based things a man can do.
Sadly he went out with a bang. 
He's a hero in my eyes.
--- 2573161
>>2569380
See if he had a stealth camp or hidden bushcraft shelter or tunnel encampment then they wouldn’t even find him. Realistically, it’s impossible to enforce something like this on sparse rural areas. They didn’t even try this shit down here, even the state governments resisted the lockdowns. Has a lot to do with all these guns people own.

>>2569494
Hmm well sometimes Germans have funny camping trips with torches on ancient prehistoric ancestral ritual grounds in a sort of collective ethnic Germanic tribal consciousness to try and remember who we are and what the Volk really means as a race and people from the forests and soil of Germany but that might violate free speech restrictions.
--- 2573165
>>2573162

Does that make you feel uneasy?

Ethnic Germans gathering in their ancestral forests with torches at night to carry on the traditions of their tribal ancestors?

If it makes you feel uneasy, it’s because it’s true and powerful. It is the ancestral land of the German race, while the government is an artificial construct. They would consider Indigenous German cultural practices as hate crimes, but then again they are not Volk, yet run the government and tell you how to behave in your ancestral forest.

His mistake (besides not executing the pigs in the initial confrontation) was being seen wearing camo and carrying a bow. It's incredibly important to look unsuspicious in these totalitarian times, and if you carry any weapon, even a bow, make sure nobody sees you with it. Germany must be the worst place to go /out/. What a bunch of bitches.

The thing thats illegal is "Zelten", putting up a tent. Its perfectly legal to put up a tarp, bivouac or hammock and noone can say shit unless you are on private property or in a nature reserve. 
Its still good to move if someone complains, just to avoid hassle.
If you setup a stealthcamp, nothing will happen at all and if you want a fire, just make sure to not have the smoke visible for everyone around. 
Asking farmers if you can stay the night often works well too, if you dont look like a hobo and might even come with some dinner and beer, depending on where you are.

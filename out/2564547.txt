I am starting on the AT at the end of next week. This is my packing list including everything except for meals and the first aid kit contents are TBD. 

Most of my gear is relatively lightweight, and I understand that lighter weight gear exists, I just simply do not own it so this is the best I can do for now. I have weighed most of my items, but some are not currently with me so I had to look it up or guess, I tried to slightly overestimate the unknown weights of items.

The items marked with a star are items I am considering dropping. I am considering dropping the fero rod, I usually carry one for fire redundancy purposes since I live in a cold area, but since I will be in the warm east near civilization I think I can get away with only a bic lighter.

As far as the first aid kit I am thinking about having just basic boo boo stuff, and foot care items, and beyond that only just enough stuff to get me to the next road in the case I had an actual serious injury.

Let me know your thoughts, do not be afraid to hurt my feelings. If you see shit I need or don't need lmk. If anybody else has a LighterPack list feel free to post it for comparison.

Ditch the ferrocerrium, keep the lighter dry. If you're worried take some waterproof matches. Everything else looks reasonable. Are you sure you meant propane and not butane stove?

>>2564547 (OP)
shit brah, your first aid weights more than your food? wtf 

just put one gauze in it, you'll never get seriously injured
--- 2564563
>>2564560
Thanks, and yes I meant butane instead of propane, my mistake.
--- 2564564
>>2564562
No, I do not have food weight listed yet, and I am not sure what my first aid is going to weigh yet. I have deliberately listed it much higher than it will be in reality so that I will have a pleasant outcome when it ends up weighing much less. Its more of a mental thing to help me pack lighter I guess.

why carry propane? the places you go don't have any wood?
--- 2564567
>>2564564
Why don't you think about carrying just the itens that you ACTUALY use when you go /out/ 

most of the times I see that ppl carry a lot of useless crap just to have all the crazy fancy gear
--- 2564570
>>2564565
Jesus Christ, in a thread with only 5 responses, two of them about propane, you have to ask about propane?

Fuck off, troll.

caut it sound dumb af for me to carry all this cooking gear instead of just using rocks and wood from the forest ..

Have fun freezing your ass off in a hammock without an underquilt

OP is leaving in a week, so he wants validation, not actual advice.

>>2564565
>>2564574
Gathering wood and building a fire on an AT thruhike isn’t reasonable. 

>>2564696
Holy shit, really? I gotta check out his list.


>Nalgene: 3.25 ounces. 
They’re more like 6oz. Drop it for a SmartWater bottle. This is standard practice.
>bladder
Use SmartWater bottles to save weight but lose convenience. 
>Sawyer Squeeze: 3oz
You forgot the full bag (or bottle) for dirty water

>shelter and sleeping bag
All quite heavy, but quite expensive to upgrade. Regardless, you absolutely must have insulation under you in a hammock. A sleeping bag alone will not work. 
>no sleep clothes or bag liner
It’s a luxury item but totally worth it. 

>cook pot: 6oz
Look for a 12cm Imusa mug and a lid from Batchstovez. The pot is maybe $10 from Walmart or Amazon, and the lid just as much. Very cheap and very light. Really you could have a Fancy Feast setup with that pot that weighs under 8oz total (it’s the setup I use).
>no utensils listed
I guess it’s just an oversight

>frog Toggs
Trash. Most people are turning the pants into cheap kilts because the crotches blow out so easily. Any jacket is going to be too warm for most of the AT, especially later on, but you might be ok now. Frog Togs aren’t exactly known to be well ventilated. 
>no insulating layers
You’ll reach Fontana Dam in two weeks if you average 12 miles a day. Then it’s a steady climb from ~900 feet elevation to 5,000 feet, so the temp will drop roughly 15°f. Highs are in the 30’s right now at Clingman’s Dome. If there’s any kind of cool front you’ll be freezing, but temps are rising so maybe you’ll be lucky.

>compass
Won’t need it
>no phone charger
Probably just not listed
>trail map
Won’t need it. You’re better off with a guide.

>>2564547 (OP)
I can tell you haven't even tested your shelter setup.

On the one hand first aid should never be something where weight is a consideration, if you need first aid you need first aid.

Saying that the first aid you actually will need on a trail like the AT is pretty small. Some bandaids for cuts/scrapes, tape or moleskin for blisters, some meds for pain/alergies, and some clippers or scissors for grooming nails/skin is pretty much what you need. There's enough traffic and frequent enough resupplies that if you really need something else you can probably get it while on the trail.

All good advice here. Looks like you might want to grab a top quilt and underquilt. That should knock a few oz off too if their down. Hammock gear econ series would be pretty quick, jackrbetter may also.

>no underquilt
This can’t be overstated. If you don’t have insulation under you in a hammock, you’re going to be cold (outside of hot tropical nights). 

A lot of underquilts are made to order,

>remove labels from filter to save weight
>wear 3 lb boots

you should strap a tank of helium to your pack.. float right down the trail, bud.
--- 2567512
>>2567411
1 cubic foot of helium can lift 0.069lbs. So an 80 cubic foot tank of helium can fill enough balloons to lift about 5.5lbs. Inb4 autists and Asians check my math.

My experience is that Bic lighters are very unreliable. I have had the top portion of them fall apart in my hands. Either carry multiple Bic lighters and plan to purchase more at resupply stops or carry a Zippo, a small butane fluid bottle and flints.
 I like Zippo's because you can start the flame and set the lighter down with your tinder to start the fire. You have to hold most disposable lighters to keep the flame going.

LMAO!

I hiked the AT in 21. I finished with a baseweight of 6.89 lbs. 50 degree sleeping bag, tarp, tyvek ground sheet. (I usually just shelter hopped). For ease of convenience, get a regular bic not mini. Its just better. No need for rain pants, just the rain jacket. also get titanium rain fly stakes. saves a bunch of weight and not too expensive. Dont have a trail map, just use guthooks (far out now). No first aid, someone else will have some that will give to you. get a lighter mini pocket knife. go shorts and not pants. i personally go no underwear but if it gets cold at night i have long underwear that way i dont have to carry pants and underwear. also you are missing a battery bank. Youll want one. Go for one that will give you 2 full charges. Hope this helps. My trail name is Gunga Din. Hopefully ill see you at my annual trail magic!

>hobo life instead of backcountry glory
Why? It sounds like you don't actually enjoy the outdoors and just run from shelter to shelters to parasite off hosts, government, and other hikers, and socialize. SOCIALIZE? WHY would you waste your vacation for that?

Easy with your terminology there bucko. Plenty of hobos would be offended by you lumping them in with bums. Hobos work while traveling or travel for work. Thru hikers are just bums
--- 2567615
>>2567613
What’s the difference between a bum and a hiker? Trekking poles.

That’s an old joke that gets passed around on the AT every year. It’s wrong though. Hobos travel looking for work. Bums neither travel nor work. Tramps travel but don’t work.

>me: "Bushcraft?"

>me: "what's that? starcraft in the bush?"
>he: "kinda. What you are wearing is bushcraft."
>me: "Ah, ok. That's just Swedish outdoor clothes."
>Tell him I'm here to explore some areas.

>Tell him there are very few girls around here.

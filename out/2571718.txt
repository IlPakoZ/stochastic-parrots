>TFW they say one does not simply carry 120lbs over the mountains.

What's your current weight limit for the kinds of outdoor activities you do?

To qualify for our team we must carry a 30kg rucksack 50km in 24 hours. The elevation gain is about 2,400m.

Sounds reasonable for a pt test. Where can I join and what are the benefits?

just recently got a finnish surplus framed backpack and did a test load of about 20kg 
(44 lbs) on a mini hike of about 10km. It works like a charm but the knee joints hate it. Will proably use it with hiking poles if going for such weight and longer hikes.

you should carry no more than a quarter of your fit (normal) body weight, some say a third but I think that is too much weight long term

3 weeks of food by carrying 70 pounds? I would carry that for sure. Not going to buy a $90 rape whistle because it's one ounce less than the $3 one, and I'm also not going to cart around 120 lbs of bullshit.

Might be 80 pounds if you want to eat exactly the calories you need. I find that starting at 60 pounds the mileage you can put out exponentially diminishes so its not really worth it to carry more than 3 weeks of food since you'll walk about the same distance in 4 weeks carrying 80 pounds as you'll do in 3 weeks carrying 60 pounds.

It's about 1/4 the weight of your mother.

If I put my bag on and can't walk around the room with it, it's too heavy.

about 50lbs before food, that way I can bring it on a plane. People always tell me that I carry too much, and then they break something and need a replacement / repair. I also sleep very comfy.

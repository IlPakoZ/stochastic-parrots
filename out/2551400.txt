>How safe is Backpacking across America for an unarmed tourist?
Backpacking across America would be boring as hell, at least the Midwest. And the climate alone would kill you in the Southwest if you got stranded and were unprepared.
Now if you mean hitchhiking instead, that hasn't been without risk since the Sixties. In my lifetime I count the number of times I got a ride or gave one on one hand (and I'm typically armed).

I have picked up 3 backpacking hitchhikers, all of them were male and smelled really bad. 2 of them begged me for money but wouldn't let me buy them food at which point I kicked them out, and one of those two absolutely reeked of alcohol and weed. 1 of them ate lunch with me and was decent to talk to, but he was also really fat so I assume he wasn't actually backpacking and just lived in the area as a beggar because he also didn't have anything to say about places he had been.

All in all, I probably won't pick up any more hitchhikers, they somehow give off this entitled aura. None of them thanked me for the distance I drove them, or were able to entertain me in some way. And the two that I kicked out were outright aggressive because I wouldn't give them money. I'm autistic so I don't really get that "feeling of accomplishment" or whatever from doing a "good deed", but maybe I'll try picking up a girl hitchhiker if I see one again. I'm just scared of sexual advances and women in general, so I've been avoiding them.

Fairly safe. Canadian here.

 I hitchhiked the appalachian mountains from New York to Georgia. That was a great trip and most of my rides came from park rangers up and down the trail and other tourists. And did the cascade mountain from Washington state to California. Ive also hitchhiked across the midwest.

In the midwest I ran into trouble. I was robbed in Chicago and then again in Milwaukee 2 days later. Finding a ride or population center are few and far between but when I made my way into Northern WI, upper Michigan and Minnesota was it nothing but super friendly people. 

The west coast was also decent until I hung out with a bunch of other homeless people in Portland OR. They ended up stealing my cooking pot, sleeping bag, and some clothing outside of Sacramento before disappering.
I would avoid huge cities if possible.

>You can buy a big knife with no licensing here
Take advantage of this if it makes you feel safer. Unfortunately there is no non-citizen gun program kek, but you can technically (illegally) buy one privately in a state like AZ if you really wanted to. I do not recommend breaking any laws while you're here, I'm just sharing information.

Dude, both of you got me 100% wrong. Ive always hated cities, but at the same time I never explore them either. That and the food is usually fantastic. Urban decay isn't something Id gloat about. This is your fucking country bud. Clean it up. 

I grew up in fuck nowhere Ontario. Only Americans I ever meet were people doing fishing trips. I ended up working for a fly-in resort and got an opportunity to go down to the US and do a show as an exibtor/salesman representing our lodge. There i got the idea of doing a backpack trip for about a month or so and see how far I get on a fixed budget of so much a day. I had an emergency fund of 2k to get me home. Best investment was a $50 mountain bike through the Appalachian trail. When I bent the rim I posted looking for a rim and boom got one for free after explaining my journey. Ran into a ton of that from the rural folks who were more than happy to help me out.
--- 2551946
>>2551925
Greyhound bus stations are strict. And will leave your ass and don't fuck around with nigger shit like a waffle house. But if you end up near say Albuquerque. Why the fuk would you want to walk across that hot ass desert? When for about 150 bucks or less you can get the fuk out of there to a much nicer and greater distance. Riding through there is miserable enough in the early summer.. dunno why you would want to be outdoors to see legit nothing for DAYS. I thought I was gonna die of dehydration just being out there on a motorcycle- because free water fillups were rare as fuck. Almost every rest stop in Southern Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. Water fountains were broken or just not working. I have two wheels and can cover distances at 75miles an hour. And still would feel the need to fill my spare gallon jug in fear of how much longer before I'd find clean drinking water.
--- 2551947
>>2551942
>Dude, both of you got me 100% wrong.
Nothing in your entire response indicates that I misunderstood you, and generally speaking I agree with your views, so you must have gotten me wrong.
>Urban decay isn't something Id gloat about. This is your fucking country bud. Clean it up. 
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. I too grew up rural, and city problems are not my problems to fix, even if I could, which I can't. I'm not going to devote my life to crusading for a lost cause when I can spend it /out/doors, away from the madness.

Now whether or not I can avoid and sidestep our country's problems for my entire life or if they'll catch up to me eventually even out here (I'm 40, so about 40 to go) is up for debate.

Serbia (83% Serbian) had a train wreck that spilled Ammonia everywhere and also killed 50 people, not even 4 months ago. I'm sure I'll get some cope about how Serbia isn't white now or something.
>government would do something instead of nothing
The government did do something, they chose to burn off the chemical before it entered the water table directly. Whether it was the right choice is still up for debate, but saying they did nothing is also just wrong.

Why are Europeans so obsessed with the US? It's so fucking sad.

First you said the EU, and Serbia is not in the EU.
The government didn’t burn off the chemicals, the rail company did.

A tent is an obvious indication of homelessness, and because the homeless commit the vast majority of crime in the US, anybody who is in possession of a tent is probably a criminal. Since the overloaded justice system and overcrowded prisons don't deter crime it's up to everybody else to fix the problem, which naturally includes beating to death people who are carrying tents or sleeping in them. If you want to travel in the US we have more than enough hotels to accommodate you, along with an extensive transportation system that includes airline service and car rentals.

I love how you can spot the seething rural people with comments like "Muh liberul cities".

In impoverished rural states like west Virginia, Mississippi or even in places like upstate NY, you won't fine more meth heads/opiate addicts and theviery than in any inner city ghetto. Combined with the fact these counties and municipalities are often corrupt and run by the same incestuous good ol' boys you are far more likely to be hassled or even rob with little immediate recourse. These are also the same boomer retards waving Maga flags and voting for the same politicians that dick them over and then blame the "liberals" in the city.
I live in NYC and if anything it's too sterile.
The biggest danger of backpacking in America is litterally getting hit by a car, than any criminal behavior. but I will call out the Euros on this that Americans drive far more conservatively then countries like Italy or France but we also have less mass transit except in some cities.
--- 2560519

You're an idiot. I've lived in suburban, urban, and rural environments and the inner-cities were by far the worst in terms of crime. But since you live in NYC, I encourage you to keep thinking that rural counties are horrible places to live and keep away. You're probably right on one count: your kind isn't well-liked around here and you would quickly be run out of town by the locals who would make life absolute hell for you.

>>2560519
Your definition of bad/good rural is likely very different, Also there are more shitty rural places that easily fit the category of inner city ghetto. Just replace the gangs and Cocaine with meth heads and opiate addicts who will rob you without a second thought.
But since we are discussing it, WV by far has the worst rural crime and poverty but as a backpacker you are unlikely to deal with them since most of the outdoor activities and trails like the AT are pretty isolated from that.

OP If you really want to avoid questionable rural areas, Maine and Vermont are very safe rural areas with very nice people. NH is not bad but the areas around dover are shitty.

Mississippi particularly on the Alabama border are really shitty, Nevada is nice but the areas East of Vegas and reno are litteral meth capitals.

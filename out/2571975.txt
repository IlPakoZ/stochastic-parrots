seems like squirrel hunting is a big deal in some places. what's the meta here? are there good recipes for squirrel, and are they good eating? what's the weapon of choice to bag them?

I enjoy it, for me it’s more of a way to go outside and enjoy nature with the excuse of carrying a gun. A savage model 42 or any combination gun of that sorts would work. I carry a 22 myself since am cheap. When it comes to recipes I’d say either fry it, stew it, or makes biscuits and gravy using it. Just make sure to make use of your kills or you’re no better than gorp core sissy's.

biscuits and squirrel gravy sounds great
--- 2572292
Well they breed like rabbits, so there's tons of them. And in many places they are not protected at all so anyone can go out with a 22, a pellet rifle, BB gun or even a slingshot, and legally harvest them. No license or permit or tags required. And they are pretty tasty when prepared right. 

The classic recipe is to toss them in some flour, fry in oil, make a gravy, then add the squirrel back in and simmer. Or if you're lazy just toss them in some water with veggies and make a stew.

I saw a marmot today in my work parking lot. Ive seen lots of marmots before in the mountains but never one in a parking lot before. Lots of meat it looks like but I think the carry the plague.

Handsome looking fella IMHO. I like his tail. Surprisingly fat for this early in the season. I dont believe in reincarnation but I wouldn't mind being a marmot I dont think.

They taste like chicken but only the dark meat.

I am considering hunting squirrels this season since I have never hunted before and it seems easy
--- 2572676
>>2572665
easy to find, hard to kill with a pellet gun. .22lr is a better pick but you still need to aim perfectly
--- 2572679
I've never seen a red squirrel

Squirrel is one of my favorite species on the difficulty to meat quality axis. I usually use shotgun early season and a .22 the rest. I usually brine them and discard the brine after 24 hours then cook however. Easy to overcook but a delicate slightly nutty meat. My favorite recipe is substituting a couple of squirrels into a carnitas recipe

I was considering using a single shot 410 with field loads actually. I am an actual poorfag so it is important that I take lots of them without wasting ammo in order to fill my freezer with squirrel. If a 410 shotshell is 5x as expensive but infinitely more forgiving than a 22 in terms of shot placement, I think that'll give me the most bang for my buck

Most people use .22lr for these .17hm2 is much better at almost any distance for squirrels. If you are in a big area and see them over a long distance then .17hmr is your best bet.

No, it's clearly a woodchuck.

You will eat the squirrels and will be happy

>hard to kill with a pellet gun
why
--- 2574497
>>2573398
If you're a poorfag why aren't you using a 12ga. 410 prices are stupid

They get skittish in areas they have been hunted. 22lr let's you shoot father but imo most my squirrel shooting is like 30-40 yds and if you're patient and have a good break barrel pellet gun it'll work.

I tried to make some cracklings from some squirrel I got last fall it was ok.
--- 2574501

Fried up the rest. Turned out ok but I think I like slow cooker better.

What about a black one?
--- 2574562
>>2574524
I've been seeing a LOT of black squirrels in Wisconsin, and white ones too. Is this a different breed, genetic aberration, or invasive species? Used to be only greys and reds around here.
--- 2574580
>>2574562
It's a generic aberration. Most don't survive because being plain white/black ruins their camouflage against predators.

The lazy do not roast any game, but the diligent feed on the riches of the hunt.

Proverbs 12:27

I don't hunt squirrel myself, but in a survival context, it would be better than starving to death.

The Indigenous tribes hunted squirrels in times of scarcity and hunger.

You don't have to wait for lean times squirrel is easily the most tasty thing in the woods. Imo it's better than deer, rabbit, and turkey.

Word of advice: Fried squirrel is recommended by a bunch of people, but they always fail to mention that young-of-year squirrels are best for frying and older squirrels are tougher and better braised.You can still fry old squirrels of course but I find them a bit too chewy.

All the squirrels in Vancouver are black so at least there, they're a breed. No idea about elsewhere.

you guys are literally eating rats
--- 2575786
>>2575336
True rats eat garbage--that makes a huge difference in meat quality. I also don't eat tree rats though.
--- 2575791
>>2572679
They are smaller then grey and black ones. We have grey and red around here in south Québec.

Usually its the opposite -where are you?

I don't think you know what that word means. Also what >>2575786 said. Rats eat garbage, forest squirrels eat nuts and seeds. Pretty big difference.

Theres normally a fair amount of chase involved in a good tree chicken hunt. Hunting them with a good dog is the best. Mountain cur us the all American tree dog. Can hunt anything that climbs with them.

Hey, do you guys have any experience with coaxing and getting kittens down from something? Theres one stuck on a roof next to me, and its too tall (20 ft) to get to it or for it to jump down. Do you guys have any ideas of what to do? I already got busted for trying to scale the building with a ladder, so that might be out of the equation.

call someone. it's not at all safe to try and lure a stranded kitten off a roof, it'll fucking fall. and the thing is stuck up there quit fucking around wasting time.

Have you tried offering the kitten a bowl of warm milk?

A couple days ago a peacock escaped from the Bronx zoo and camera crews surrounded it in a tree. The zoologists however said "leave it alone and eventually it will get hungry and come back to the zoo."

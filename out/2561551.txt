Is this jade, /out/ ?

Nobody can say from a picture, but if you have to ask, the answer is no. If you really want to be certain that I'm right, you should do a specific gravity test. I'm assuming youre hoping this is nephrite?

>>2561551 (OP)
I should also add that nephrite is translucent, so if you shine a flashlight on it in the dark, you should be able to see the light permeating the stone. Just from this rocks appearance, I would say it does not appear to have translucence.

I dont know much about jade, but nephrite would be my guess too.
--- 2561559
No. That's a rock.
--- 2561560
>>2561556
It is translucent, you just dont see on the picture.
--- 2561561
Here is some real nephrite I collected last year

>>2561561
If my rock had a smooth surface it would look like yours i think.
It is quite rough.
Where did you find that?
--- 2561569
>>2561566
I disagree, I think your stone is an ultramafic rock. Do a specific gravity test and report back. Also put a magnet on it. Is it magnetic?
--- 2561591
>>2561569
It is magnetic.

Then it ain't jade

That looks like some sort of pegmatite to me 

Check out this emerald I found in some feldspar and quartz

that's a cannonball from blackbeard's ship. I would urge you to put it down but I'm afraid it's too late... you're cursed now.

>>2561551 (OP)
not sure honestly but i did get this from a smoke shop today and I dont think they realized they just handed me free money i did a bit of sanding to see the color
--- 2563849

No it isn't. 

Jade looks like its all melted like a very dense glass. And you cannot scratch it with the end of your knife.
--- 2563873
>>2563789
This looks like a low quality opal or perhaps just not polished

Oh well.

That wasn't jade retard. California jade is nephrite, aka one of the toughest natural materials on earth. You couldn't flake it, even with a sledgehammer.
--- 2566030
>>2565670
> it flakes so nicely 
Nephrite jade is literally impossible to flake

Once a man of Ch'u, named Pien Ho, came by an uncut jade in the Ch'u Hills. He brought it home and submitted it as a present to King Wu. Thereupon King Wu had a jeweller give an opinion of it. "It is an ordinary stone," said the jeweller. The King, regarding Ho as a liar, had his left foot cut off. Upon King Wu's death, King Wên ascended the throne, when Ho again submitted it as a present to King Wên. King Wên also had a jeweller give an opinion of it. Again he said, "It is an ordinary stone." The King, also regarding Ho as a liar, had his right foot cut off. When King Wên died and King Ch'êng ascended the throne, Ho, carrying the uncut jade in his arms, cried at the foot of the Ching Hills. After three days and three nights his tears were all exhausted and blood flowed out. At this news the King sent men out to ask him the reason, saying, "Throughout All-under-Heaven men whose feet were cut off are many. Why should you be crying so bitterly?" "I am lamenting not the loss of my feet," said Ho in reply, "but for the calling a precious gem an ordinary stone and for their dubbing an honest man a liar. This is the reason why I am lamenting." Meanwhile, the King had a jeweller polish up the jade and got the treasure out at last. So it was designated "the Jade of Pien Ho"

I went somewhere with shiny rocks recently, but you needed a loiscence and a yearly fee if you wanted to take some

feel like most of the advantages to wearing sandals go away if you are also wearing socks with them, doesn't make it wrong but more like if you need the additional warmth/protection of a sock then a real shoe/boot also probably makes sense. doesn't make the sock sandals wrong and if 90% of your trip is sandal weather and just need socks for some cold evenings or something. 

style wise it will not get you laid but who cares about that when you are out?

Wise words.

Wearing socks with Chacos is easily the most comfortable footwear in the outdoors. I've done a few 14ers in them. Never had a problem getting laid, and I even turned a gf around on the issue.

If you're getting away with socks and sandals, you're not even technically /out/ imo.

You're right. Longs, Blanca, and Princeton are indoors.

btw why don't they make the sole from some breathable material? It's pretty shit standing on and sweating in that plastic/rubber shit.
--- 2566985
Wool socks, sandals, and rubber overboots and gaiters for foul weather. 

Probably a good budget footwear system. Will need to do my own research...

wool Socks+sandals is peak modular outdoor footwear.

Protects sole-check
Breathable-check
Fast drying- check
Warmth- check (you're obviously not wearing these in the snow)

Just got my first pair of Chacos after wearing Teva for 30 years and I gotta tell you, the footbed is amazing. I don't even have bad arches.

Ive heard that these are really uncomfortable and bad for stream crossings. Really light though

Yes, if you're not used to walking barefoot.
>bad for stream-crossing
I haven't had any problems

I actually wore socks + sandals in the snow when it was (barely) freezing out-- obviously not for heavy snow but for intermittent on the trail it was great. I run warm though.
I live in a very wet part of the country but for some reason socks + sandals in the rain doesn't really bother me, especially with wool socks.

Out in public? Kind of weird. Innawoods? What the fuck else am I going to wear when I'm at camp and the sun starts going down. I just spent all day in my boots, I want to let my feet breathe a little bit without getting cold/bug bites.

Sock protects your skin and absorbs sweat that would otherwise pool under your sole, while still being way more breathable than any shoe.

Add in dipping them in a cold stream and you've got yourself an evening

So you're okay with socks and sandals then?
--- 2571046
Flip flops without socks are better. Whenever you see photos of Asians or Africans, they're wearing flip flops, and they spend their entire lives living outside.

No...just incredibly retarded. You want your feet to not be inside of a shoe and more exposed to air, so why wear a sock?
It's likw peoplw who wear long sleeves with shorts...what's wrong with you? You're cold on the arms but hot on the legs? Makes no sense.

Hey fuck you that big ass blood thing in my toenail from last summer is nearly gone.

Dude you clearly don't go /out/. You wear long sleeve shirt to protect you from the sun. You wear socks with sandals to protect your feet from the sand but still being comfortable in camp. Desert camping clearly isn't your expertise (nor is /out/)

I hate Waterloo, Ontario and want to go join my sister in Alberta there is literally nothing for me in this libtarded chink shithole and the only people that share my ideology here all do meth. Only way I'm going to be able to get to her is to bike to her.

I plan on making a tulpa or finding a higher power on the way too, as I need to find something that will bring me lasting satisfaction, and help me to overcome the intense loneliness I feel every day of my life. I don't to ever emotionally rely on anyone ever again as everyone in my life has always betrayed me and if I get all my happiness and companionship from an imaginary friend that is much better than having to deal with people who don't really like me anyways and just use me and hurt me.

I was super sick over the winter months but I'm finally better and I'm doing about 40km a day (and that's being lazy I can do way more) going to work my way back up to 200km a day. I have insane amounts of energy all the time, high-metabolism genetics, and I don't tire even after biking or wandering around more than 24 hours. Plus I will convert my bike to eBike so I can even more easily do the whole trip, but while I'm training I just bike on regular bicycle. I've also been homeless since I can't really remember when anymore but years now and been through so many winters, and it's not winter anymore, but I'll be taking my suit for -40 anyways with me and I'm used to very prolonged and intense suffering in the worst weather.

If anyone does this sort of thing here tell me about it, I'm going to need to acquire a few more things for my bicycle and make some upgrades.

You are deeply mentally ill, consider MAID.

I hear there are a lot more far-right oriented people out there then here and there's better jobs and my sister likes it better out there and she lives there she escaped this shithole and has made a better life there so I'm going to join her instead of rotting here and as for America the FBI will arrest and interrogate me if I go over the border so that's not an option. I need to keep myself busy and biking around aimlessly sucks so I may as well bike to see my sister.

Not yet available to me. Me and Max are going to get ourselves euthanized probably though when this happens.

Even that one goal will keep you going and keep your spirits up.

Why would I want to live around people who don't even speak English and are short and disgusting though?

Unless there's an enclave of National Socialists somewhere in Mexico I can go live with, I don't want to go.

Plus, it's impossible for me to immigrate anywhere, I have no money and I'm white.

I'd go pick you up and drive you out here to your sister but gas is expensive these days, I hear flights are very cheap to saskatoon though, a friend of mine in Ontario flies there evrey now and then for like $200

I’m in Kitchener and also want to move to Alberta and agree I have nothing in common with the races here. 

Just take a train to Alberta tho are you actually a neet? And you don’t have a car?

There are plenty of conservative rural areas around there. You're in Mennonite territory anon. People are so conservative there that they don't believe in gas motored vehicles.

I've never had a car before.

I just relapsed into sickness again because of the lack of sunlight and it being colder also so I'm discouraged as fuck right now.

I've been nauseated for months and it's back again. I seem to be permanently sick.

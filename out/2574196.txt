I'm not gonna eat random shit but I'd like to be able to identify mushrooms without using my phone

>>2574196 (OP)
don't go near mushrooms. all of them contain mycotoxins that mimic estrogen.
that's why most modern men are pathetic beta bitches it's because most buildings have at least some kind of mold in them
--- 2574243
The National Audubon Society Field Guide To Mushrooms is often used for this.
--- 2574250
Maybe a local one. Learn the few you are going to see, not 200 random ones.
--- 2574251
>>2574225
everything put into (you) mimics estrogen
--- 2574300
>>2574243
I have it
it's really good
I still don't ever pick mushrooms I haven't been taught to identify by someone who's been doing it for atleast 30 years.
The thing about people who have been harvesting mushrooms for decades is I have yet to meet one who wasn't willing to teach you everything they know...and then some.

>>2574300
People actually think like this? Are you too incompetent to identify properly or scared that you need an authority figure to say the same thing to make you feel comfortable?
--- 2574434
>>2574196 (OP)
it's not that hard. there are a lot of simple field guides out there; just pick the one that is the closest to your location. Most of the choice edibles are very distinct and are hard to mix up with others.

The only thing mimicking estrogen here is you faggot
--- 2574481
Tho it would be helpful to mention what region you’re in, this is considered one of the best

His book Mushrooms Demystified is more comprehensive. Note of course that it was written some time ago and phylogenies have changed a lot since then.

>>2574196 (OP)
Just get one specific to your region. Your goal of not using your phone isn't very safe/realistic, though - online sources like Mushroomexpert.com if you're in US/Canada have more detailed information than most guidebooks, and there are species that aren't in guidebooks because they're too rare. Also like I said mushroom phylogeny is constantly being updated so it's good to have sources that are up to date. Basically guidebooks are a good starting point and the Internet is where you'll want to go next.

OP is asking about mushroom ID, not complex genetics and phylogeny

You clearly thunk you're smarter than you obviously are.
Life is hard for you isn't it.

>Mushroom identification isn't complex
I live where there are more varieties of mushrooms than the Amazon or Congo. You've never picked a Mushroom to eat in your life.
--- 2575514
>>2575167
I never said it wasn’t complex, and I’ve harvested plenty 

But, for the most ID’ing the most commonly eaten mushrooms *is* simple

>Someone taught me how to do it therefore it is very simple
It is clear you missed the point.

And that is?

OP isnt living in the jungle. He’s a regular hobbyist who just wants a reference book, not a tome. 

I’ve learned thru my own research.

The Hoh raunforest isn't a jungle. No one cares that you figured out what a moral looks like where you live in Alabama.

>>2575777
Trips confirm it, Alabamans have no morals
--- 2575895
>>2575777
No one cares where you live, or where you hunt.

OP needs a good field guide, and this is one of the best.

Anyone looking for a good pocket field guide should take a look at this book

Depends on your region OP. I own 15+ mycology books. I have been foraging for over ten years. 

Tell me what region you are from and I will suggest a book. David Arora books are good but mostly west coast specific sans mushrooms demystified but this is not a good beginner book, yet it is still a very good one. 

Identifying mushrooms to genus 1 macroscopic features. 

Use Inaturalist. Use social media to get a second opinion from actual mycologist so you don't die.

Just don't eat anything you don't know what it is. You might go looking for one obvious mushroom and find maybe 100 of them and 1 dodgy lookalike, which might be the most interesting thing you saw. And depending on how much you poke around a whole lot of other interesting ones, that you shouldn't put in your mouth until you can say what they are. One of the biggest killers out there is because it looks like a normal field mushroom to people who cant pay attention to something a simple as the colour of its gills. There are few so dangerous as far as how many people they fuck up. Know what you are looking at and go pick a couple, and read the rest of the books while you are doing it, and don't stick em right in your mouth
--- 2575932
You can pick em, lick em, take them home in your pocket, just don't eat anything you cannot identify
--- 2576208
Puffballs are good eating and easy to identify, quite distinct, like morels. A good entry point.

Welcome to the worst board on all of 4chan.
--- 2557820
>>2557807 (OP)
We're actually all good friends irl but /out/ is where we post our fantasies. None of us actually ever go outside. Just hang /out/ and have a drink with us and HARDEN THE FUCK UP. 

Aw shit anon, I was just joshin' ya. Here, have a beer. Want some trail mix? Here, pull that Helinox Chair Zero up closer to the fire. 

You sure got a purty mouth...
--- 2557827
The main strategy of the parasites that infest this shithole is to divide. 
In no case can they allow a feeling of rapport to develop, or this dump would create an army of dissidents willing to cause chaos irl in defense of their frends. 
The jannies reserve their fiercest loathing for anons that are nice. 
It's a microcosm of the jewSA, same principles apply.
>inb4 thread balleeted in 3, 2, 1
--- 2557829
There are 2 or 3 guys who sit on this board 24/7 constantly complaining about what /out/ 'used' to be they samefag threads to death if they don't like the subject.

I'm pretty sure they're genuine oldfags that used to use other boards but can't cope with how much 4chan has changed and so have abandoned them focusing all of their effects on /out/ in a last ditch attempt at saving one board. Unfortunately they are prone to autistic meltdowns and have taken on the role of pseudo-jannies (this board does not have dedicated jannies all moderation comes from other boards) and all of this has lead to utter chaos here. What you have is a minority of people with extremely strong opinions, autism, multiple IP addresses and a moderation team that do not understand this board and so delete anything with the most reports.
--- 2557832

/out/ has tons of newfags with shit takes and tiresome bullshit opinions based on little or no experience. And I don’t mean they’re new to the board. They’re new to outdoor recreation.

conceptually its a self defeating board. it can only really be used to discuss gear and locations, after that? You go outside. So people argue over using a knife to baton wood and what water bottle is best, what's the best ultralight under 100 dollar tent, etc. Consumerism, elitism and other shit. Its like, if you go out and take a couple pics, share 'em here I guess but why bother? Oh well. Its fun to check in on in case somebody actually has a good story, but ultimately, if you go outside, you're not on 4chan.

because /out/ is too vague for a board topic, so you have fags saying they like hiking arguing with ATV/motorbikering fags over who has the right to some public land because no one here can afford their own land. this board is literally every single public land argument over every single little thing, because you're all gay poorniggers get fucked faggots

This board probably a microcosm of outdoor recreation issues at the national scale, which boils down to too many people trying to use available resources. That's why we're trying to slow population growth and limit access to public lands -- the sooner we can prevent unnecessary access, the sooner the ecosystems will recover. WEF corporate partners and governments strive to bring social responsibility to outdoor recreation. With your cooperation we will achieve equity in the outdoors and reverse global warming.

--- 2559567
Fishing general is filled with anglers who actually know their shit. You can sift through the banter and the troll posting quite easily if you're an avid angler. The common thing you see is non-anglers shitting on bass fishermen despite the fact the few bass guys who post their regularly absolutely know a thing or two and don't mind handing out advice. Then there's a bunch of fly anglers yearning to teach, a bunch of PNW anglers who catch nice trout / steelhead, etc. 

We have 1 or 2 people who try to shit it up, but everyone has learned to make fun of them and move on. Look at /off-road general/ and it's the exact opposite. One guy has been trolling them for ~3 months now it seems and they still keep replying to him and nothing of value is discussed due to it.
--- 2559568

Agreed. I think it’s the biggest problem. Maybe it’s because the concept of going outdoors is so simple that deviation from normal experience seems so dumb or made up.

Reddlt transplants can't comprehend every board belongs to /pol/ and /pol/ evolved from /b/... /out/ was an afterthought and is one of the "new" boards.
Reddlt retards come here and try to make it a hugbox echo chamber and get pissy because they don't comprehend what it is and cry about not being able to gatekeep, shame, and group think consensus like they're accustomed to.

tl;dr: Reddlt transplants are retarded but no one tells them on reddlt because of uproot and censorship then they come here and get slammed for being retarded and cry about it constantly.

Let me guess. You're the retard who keeps his shoes on for creek crossings. Years later you're still butthurt over getting called out for your dumbfuck opinion.
--- 2560558
>>2560538
It was an even split, with half of everyone leaving their shoes on and the other half telling everyone what they would do if they ever went outside.

The Eagle Rock Loop trail in Ouachita NF is just under 30 miles long with 11 creek crossings (I think it’s 13 after a heavy rain). Would you really stop every ~3 miles to take off your shoes?

Most of /out/ doesn't actually care about /out/ stuff directly, they are largely schizoids who use the outdoors, or even just the idea of the outdoors, as a coping mechanism, and being socially retarded mental cripples means they are all in a constant state of misery and are always looking for the closest scapegoat, that being the mental cripple right next to them.

A few posts above this one some faggot stated that anyone who’s “into ultralight” is from Reddit.

All hiking is casual with no barrier to entry. That's why you see way more casuals hiking than rock climbing, mountain biking, scuba diving, hunting, bushcrafting, and other activities that require technical skill and sometimes licenses/certifications. 

Ultralight is just being autistic and obnoxious about an activity that any non-crippled retard can do. At least normie hikers on Facebook and Instagram realize what they're doing isn't special and just want to have an enjoyable experience. Nothing wrong with that. That's more than you can say about UL faggots.

love how the MODS and Jannies LOVE to use 4chan in their job resumes and shit. actually encountered one in a community college, PROUD and WHIPPING HIS BABY DICK AROUND about it. Lots of regular guys/gals avoiding him and/or patting him on the back hoping he doesn't go school shooter.
he also LOVED to use the KEYWORD he was told to use, DISINGENUOUS, believes it causes glowies to get hardons for his dick and save him money for bar hopping.
nowadays you just gotta hop around, try to shift through the waste, give good posts, and laugh at the weasles and tryhard trolls, mods or tryhard betamax mods.

It’s like saying running isn’t a real sport because it doesn’t involve a ball, there isn’t a huge set of rules, you don’t need a ref, and the sport is defined by the 2 mile gun run in your local park. Meanwhile people on forums are getting in touch with other ultramarathoners and people who run 25k’s ever weekend. But your pickup game of basketball is way more hardcore.

people stacking rocks doesn't help anyone, themselves included usually,
everyone chopping down green trees, getting mad when they can't burn the tree right then and there, steal/borrow dried wood and then get drunk/high/fuck, party, throw bottles everywhere and fuck off into the morning light trying to skip paying for fucking up the camp site/location.
thats the first thing most campgrounds/farmers/landowners experience.
then there's the kid/guy/internet wise guy who keeps seeing "how to survive in the wilderness without a tent, tools, anything but a rock, some string/rope/ducktape and your wits" guys who end up wrecking an area, because they didn't want to buy a cheap 20 dollar tent, weather proof it and just throw a cheap camo wrap around it for the season to stealth it, while never thinking that having a fire is easily the fastest way for anyone with a working nose, eyes, ears, and a dog to find them without fail.

keep an eye out for these, wilderness survival huts, lots of them leave them standing, means you can come back in a week or three in dry weather and have a nice supply of firewood no one else is touching to have your campfires with.

filter your water, its the second easiest way to get water, first is the old waterpills method(take container, bandana to keep mud out, fill with water, put waterpill/treatment in, shake, wait suggested time, DRINK.
FIlter, more expensive BUT, depending on the type, you get your water NOW and/or after a couple minutes(several gallons gravity filtered NICE for setting up your site and having freshly filtered, cold water)
Just don't forget your salt/sugar/spices and you are golden.
cotton to cool off/stay cool while sweatin. wool for staying warm when cold/somewhat wet. Just don't believe you don't stink.
liners for your sleeping bags equals clean bags after you get your messy ass in them all the time and/or a lighter sleeping bag during hotter nights/days.

TExT WALLS!!

I'm pretty moderate on all things /out/ related since I've been out in a lot of different places with a lot of different people.

I go trout fishing in streams for a whole week every summer. I don't wear galoshes or gators I just take my shoes off everytime I cross or wade into a stream. Sometimes I leave them off all day because I mostly fish in cow pastures and the thistles barely tickle through my calluses.

Do whatever makes sense to you. The friends I go fishing with always wear gators and they think I'm crazy. To each his own.

Before anyone asks I've never had ringworm or injuries, if anything I have more trouble with ingrown toenails when I wear wet shoes or waterproof boots that don't let my feet breath. Your own experience will probably be different than mine, I'm not sharing opinions just facts.

Isn’t it odd how everyone with a lot of experience comes close to the same conclusion, or at least has a working knowledge of why other people do or prefer things a certain way? Those without recommend waterproof socks or something equally ridiculous.

4chan has always been a strong willed board to prevent cultutal subversion taking over the board. This is the biggest reason for isms here.
Out has become consumer general. Theres very little content, just questions about boots and best out chic fashion over and over and over again. It doesnt even matter what you say in the threads either because people will post their same reddit opinion in each one.
I dont think people go out anymore outside of alltrails follow the line.

Yeah, just let your feet stew in their own sweat for an entire day while hiking 10 or 15 miles. It’ll be fine. Literally everyone does this. Wool socks are a meme.
--- 2570612
>>2570595
Neoprene socks are superior to wool for keeping your feet dry for creek crossings. Isn't that what this discussion is about?
--- 2570614
https://www.gearassistant.com/neoprene-socks-for-hiking/

>You may also choose to wear neoprene socks for river crossings. If you are required to cross a river early on in your hike, you will want to avoid soaking your boots and socks. Replacing your boots with neoprene socks can keep your feet warm and give them some protection as you cross the river and you will have dry boots to put back on when you reach the far shore.

>Wide, cold rivers, especially in spring when the snow is melting, can chill your feet dangerously and you can find yourself slipping or bumping off rocks. Removing your boots and socks and wearing neoprene socks instead can give you enough warmth and insulation to cross safely. Once you reach the far bank, you can put your dry boots and socks back on and limit the risk of cold, soaked feet for the remainder of your hike.

Because people who go outside can't access 4chan. So this channel is full of people who wished they could go /out/.

it's part of the reason I only post like twice a year nowadays, most of the good discussions got fragmented a long time ago to different discord servers or you eventually find groups of real people instead of the wild amount of armchair enthusiasts on /out/. There's still some real solid posters but you'll be able to catch on and tell who shoots straight. 

Just don't get caught up in gear faggotry and get the fuck /out/, the cool gear and comfy pics will come in time if you want them to.

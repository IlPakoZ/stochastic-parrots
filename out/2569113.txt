Is commuting to work that dangerous in Clapistan?

I have the garmin watch with topographic maps

>>2569116
Yes it is, either on the road from.some sleep deprived/hungover driver who sheckleburg boss had work 80 to 100 +hours a week crashing into you. To the crackheads at the bus stop/metro station that will threaten you with used needles for cash.
--- 2569123
>>2569120
Oh yes forgot to mention without the garmin watch you cant remote control the inreach PLB. Which is more of an issue if you keep in the case.

--- 2569266
Don't you have to pay for the inreach to work as a PLB? Or is it just the satcom you have to pay monthly for?
There was some famous missing hiker case where he has a spot PLB but he didn't have the subscription so he died lol
--- 2569279
>>2569266
Yes you need subscription for the Garmin to work.
--- 2569288
>>2569266
Yea the subscription is the biggest bullshit. Even if the emergency button works, you can get something for half the price tied to govt search and rescue.
Satellite messaging to occasionally tell someone you're running late or need them to drive over and pick you up shouldn't cost 500 bucks + a forced monthly fee.
It's a shame Garmin practically has a monopoly on the market or we might get that service at reasonable rates

Just use pic. Inb4 retards who don’t know how cell phones have worked for the past 15 years despite having several of them.
--- 2569419
>>2569288
The subscription for the garmin inreach is at the lowest tier 11bux a month w/contract and 15bux without. Something Iike 10 free messages, weather and unlimited sos.
I would not blame garmin but iridium that owns the satellites

Cell phones do have dedicated GPS and have for about a decade now. Also, I'm pretty sure that iFaggot wasn't even talking about that and was referring to the fact that the newest iPhones now have built a in Satellite SOS feature that indeed uses satellites to contact EMS with your location and you can even text them

It’s so strange to me that people are still unaware of how the GPS function of a cell phone works. It’s just baffling as hell. 

Battery life? Sure, you can only squeeze four days out of one by putting it in power saving mode, turning down the brightness, closing background apps, using airplane mode, not checking your location every two minutes, and so on. And you’ll need the separate power supply that you probably already own if you want to extend it longer than any trip you’ve probably been in without access to power anyway.

Durability? Yeah, you have to be careful not to smash it with a rock like a Cro-Magnon and you have to know where to buy Ziploc freezer bags. Nearly everyone hikes with a phone anyway, and since everyone mentions this there must be a lot of Grug rock smashing, a severe shortage of Ziploc bags, and a lot of broken and water damaged phones.

But muh cell service? Nah.

This discussion again? 
Yes, you *can* use your phone for navigation if you're a complete pleb who needs his fucking trendy gizmos to move around the outdoors without risking getting lost if he lost his precious trail markers/blazes.

>and these people call themselves "outdoorsmen"
--- 2569452
>>2569449
Holy shit, /out/ is making progress and people are catching up to where everyone else was a decade ago and realizing what a GPS signal is! Next we’ll all learn about this new material they’re calling “silpoly.”

No, it doesn't as far as I know. Pesticides wash off pretty easily and there is such a thing as organic cotton. Besides, my base layers are wool.

You’re the first Luddite contrarian fag to actually admit that a phone will work as a GPS device without a cell signal. You should try it next time you’re out. The. You can come back and be contrarian again by saying it was only accurate to 3m which isn’t nearly as good as your Garmin, while simultaneously saying people shouldn’t need gadgets or gizmos (that you already own, and already have in your pocket).

The Garmin Explore app is pretty gud. You can import/export gpx files, create courses and way points. You can also take a tracked activity from your garmin device (i.e a hike) and turn it into a course.

These threads are so fucking exhausting. Its always poor fags trying to justify the fact they can't afford one of the best oh shit buttons ever made. Go watch thru hiker death stories and realize what a valuable thing a garmin inreach is.

You will notice that Arabic is printed on top because that is the common language of the Holy Land.

I guess it would make sense to write and speak in Arabic talking to the average person in the Holy Land.

English is a common ground, and Hebrew is pretty common as well, but the native population speaks Arabic.

That's all sports honestly, and I've never understood the reason either. Sports are fun to play, but why the fuck would I watch? Literally cucking yourself out of fun, it's just like when people watch streams of video games. Just play the game yourself??? What the fuck?

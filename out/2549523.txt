I'm supposed to be on trail in less than 3 weeks but the entire fucking trail in buried in snow...
--- 2549524

Yeh you ain't gonna be hiking the Sierra portion of the pct any time soon, with how much they've been getting buried. 

Should have planned ahead.

My hometown near Arrowhead is buried and the grocery store fucking collapsed from all the snow- the mountains aint gonna be good to go for awhile

Yeah you're probably fucked. You could go hard with snowshoes and a sled but the ground will dry while you're on trail. You could try to hide it or rent a storage unit if it's worth it to you.

>Yeh you ain't gonna be hiking the Sierra portion of the pct any time soon, with how much they've been getting buried.
Why not? Its just walking on snow. My plan is to get through the Sierra's quick before everything begins to melt. By going early I am hoping to encounter fewer stream crossings and have less postholing.
>>2549529
>>2549531
A few weeks from now I think we'll be good. Sierras will be a bitch no matter what
--- 2550953
its going to be closed off. However if you want to rogue it, prepare for trails under 30 feet of snow, avalanches, flooding, and death.

The first month is all desert. The trail doesn't summit mt San Antonio. If you aren't leaving until April anyway you won't actually hit the sierras until June. I'm sure this season will be worse than any in recent memory, but you should cry about it when you get there. Who knows it might all melt by then due to global warming.

OP is probably a fucktard who thinks “walking on snow” is easy/possible (without snow shoes). The PCT is gay in normal years with the 5000+ normie faggots who attempt it these days. If OP is actually a badass half-yeti hybrid hiker more power to him. It would be better to just go south bound this year, you’ll even get more of the trail before the fires start in July/August up north.

I'll be in campo the first week of april so I hope to enter the sierras like 3rd week of may. I dont know shit, so I could be wrong, but it seems like the river crossings are the biggest danger, so I'm hoping to clear the sierras before everything melts turns to shit
I have crampons, snowshoes and an ice axe

I have snow shoes.

I dont want AT levels of social interaction, but I also dont want SOBO levels of social interaction. I want to go NOBO and stay in-front of the bubble. Maybe hike behind a cute girl and sniff her butt all day/

>I'm sorry to hear that man. I did it in 2018 and I never even got rained on until the last week.
I have led a life of disappointment so I have become something of a cope-artist. And with these abilities I have convinced myself that this year is going to be epic. I know its going to suck, and there will be some temptation to flip-flop, but I'm fully committed to roughing it out and spending the next decade reminding faggots about how "back in my day.."
I havent even hit the trail yet and I already look down on you for hiking in such pussy conditions :)

Bad year for PCT thru hike attempts I'm afraid. At least you're aware of this. It' s going to be interesting to see how most thru-hikers response to the conditions.
The follow up concern is the state of the rivers once this snow melts out.
imo I would just forget trying to thru the pct this year, use the time and money to hike a bunch of other stuff rather than just sloggin the the bits of the pct that are free. Then return to the sierra in the fall when they might be more manageable. 
I'm planning to try the sierra high route this year, but have pushed my plans as far back into sept as possible

I think most people will skip, or "flip flop" and never come back.

I hit the Sierras second half of May, so I'm hoping to avoid that.
>imo I would just forget trying to thru the pct this year, use the time and money to hike a bunch of other stuff rather than just sloggin the the bits of the pct that are free. Then return to the sierra in the fall when they might be more manageable. 
I'm fully locked in so I'm just going to make the best of it. The snowpack provides a really good opportunity to learn both mountaineering and back-country navigational skills.
But who knows? Maybe the weather will turn around. Still got a few weeks

Yeah, the fearmongering has begun on reddit.
But I'm really looking forward to the Sierras, more than anything else. Its going to be a once in a lifetime adventure on top of a once in a lifetime adventure
>>2553610

Wish I learned. Cross country looks comfy af
--- 2553643
>>2553640

I never learned until recently. I just bought the gear and went out and started trying to use it.

You will fall a few times your first day out, but will eventually figure it out.
--- 2553708
>>2553640
you have time to learn, i learned recently in a few days with just like 1 hour a day. plenty of good yt vids teaching u the basics, and then if u can try to go with someone who know how to ski, they can correct ur form
--- 2554134
>>2553708
sounds fun, but probably not the time for that. this trip through the sierras is going to be fucking insane. something that I am just soo under qualified for, its almost suicidal, reckless at best.
plus I dont wanna carry some heavy ass ski's. pack will already be 50lbs with snowshoes, an ice axe and crampons
--- 2554141
>>2554134
Weight of skis is far made up for by the increased speed, both uphill and downhill. Snowshoes are very slow and obnoxious.

I might have time to hike the PCT this year, I'm going over it as a plan B. But can't start till June, so am trying to figure a good starting point for a flip flop.
--- 2555539
>>2552063
>Maybe the weather will turn around. Still got a few weeks
Nope. More storms predicted thru first half of April and very good possibility of hitting all time snow records from '51-52. Lots of places very close to 700 inches of snow already.

You could hike SOBO?
--- 2555628
>>2555582
I have to be home before the end of September so waiting to start a SoBo would leave a really tight time frame.
--- 2555631
>>2555628
You plan to hike the pct in under 3 months? You should definitely do it don't even bother reading about it. I have faith in you and your abilities.
--- 2555632
>>2555628
I guess you would have to start in NorCal if you want to be in the bubble. Another option would be hiking something like the Hayduke trail. With all the snow and water, it should be a good year for a desert hike
>>2555631
>You plan to hike the pct in under 3 months?
He wants to section hike
--- 2555666
>>2555631
>You plan to hike the pct in under 3 months?
Noo I have ~100 days to hike but can only start early june. One idea is to start in NorCal and hike NoBo to the northern terminus, then flip back to NorCal and hike SoBo to the southern terminus. 
>>2555632
Yeah a NorCal start seems to be the best option. desu the more I look at it the more I think I'm going to stick with original plan.
>Hayduke
I hiked a 900 mile Hayduke last fall. Was amazing.

--- 2557465
Probably would want to hit the sierra in July. There will still be plenty of snow but enough will have melted that you will have an easier time with crossings. The only downside is you will be flirting with wildfire season heavily in the north. 

If you are set on your start date. Then, if you can safely get to cottonwood pass with the gear you bring, you are for sure good to go on the rest of the trail. If however, you feel like your gear (most likely shoes) you are under gunned before this point, pull off the trail and get a real set of mountaineering boots with a full shank and a real set of crampons you can kick steps with. 

Do a sanity check at cottonwood pass because it only gets harder from there - and it would be a good bailout point to go to lone pine/independence and hole up until your new gear arrives. GL.

Bro do not make this trek unless you are prepared with snowshoes and are prepared for insane river crossings. 
The snowpack is extremely high this year. After 10 AM the snow will get extremely loose/sludgy and you will be postholing in 8 feet of snow. I am doing JMT next month and I am very nervous about the dangers this year.
--- 2559216
>>2555685
>>nooo our reservoirs are depleted and there's no snow!!
was true for several years straight
>>noooo it's flooding and there's too much snow!
Also true- tho no one is claiming too much snow yet.

--- 2559218
>>2549523 (OP)
Going in May in a really high snow year is quite ballsy. Don't be surprised if you come across rivers that are too sketchy to cross, and don't be too proud too turn around.

Hiked it and '17 and had the time of my life, just get out there, everybody will tell you to skip the Sierras "Muh not passable, can't through hike this year".
Just get up there and see it for yourself take a lot of food (carried 10 days worth out of kearsage pass). If you can't make a river crossing just turn around, don't cross if you're not comfortable just make camp and look for a besser crossing the next day. 
Will be hard and painful but so rewarding being among a handfull of people trying to make their way across.

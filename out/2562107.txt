I am taking my first lesson tomorrow (book stuff/introduction, nothing on the water yet unfortunately).

My plan is to take these lessons for a month, and practice for a year when I can get the time, save up (I have saved up for a year already), and live in a used 35 foot boat. I am not going totally off grid, at that point I'd be living in an anchorage or mooring and work a job a short distance away. But to ease cost I have been fishing for a bit now and am learning. Of course solar panels, rainwater catchment, etc. will be put in place to ease cost.

At the end of this, about two years from now, I want to be in a position where I am not working for months at a time and living off the sea/whatever food I preserved. Putting in the autistic will and dedicated to do this, is this realistic? What will be my biggest obstacles?

inb4 running away I'd be swimming

Biggest obstacle will be the actual sailing. If you have no experience sailing at all, I recommend sailing as often as possible for more than a few years to get a feeling for how much you actually enjoy it.

I hope you're not thinking you're going to save money by living on a sailboat. It might be cheaper than renting + owning a sailboat, but it's likely going to cost nearly the same if your boat is in constant use.

Oh yeah sail a bunch first to see if you like it, you might be sensitive to seasickness or something you don't even know about yet. You can probably fix seasickness by getting properly sick once though.

You know absolutely nothing about sailing or sailboats, that's clear. A sailboat is not a log cabin in the woods. It is an enormous money pit that needs constant maintenance from expensive specialized services. There's a reason why modern sailing is associated with rich older men. Your plan will bankrupt you at best and most likely kill you the instant you go on the open sea.

How much? Ultimately, your budget is going to determine whether or not this is realistic, so yes, the exact number matters.

before you do that shit, hook up with some loopers for a summer to see how much that shit sucks

I've also been taking lessons with almost the exact same goal in mind. I'm less committed so it will take longer. People buy sailboats and go cruising all the time, so we know it's possible. Living on a boat must be the most /out/ thing possible, it's disappointing how many naysayers there are in this thread. People living in $500k homes driving $40k cars are telling you a sailboat is too expensive. It's crazy.

Have you thought about joining a crewed vessel? For instance a tall ship? I spoke to someone on the crew for the Pride of Baltimore just two days ago, and they said there is much higher demand for crew after COVID shenanigans.

I think a membership at a sailing center or something is a great start though. Try to do some networking and get sailing with folks, can't stress the importance of that. And log your hours out on the water.

There is nothing more destructive than being immersed in seawater. It eats away at absolutely everything on your boat. And the fact that you think buying an old used boat will save you money instead of trapping you in a leaky deathtrap with a wornout engine is laughable. That's like buying a cheap 250k mi car that falls apart the instant you drive it off the lot and needs $5000 in repairs.

might be missing something, but why the fuck are these people spending early hurricane season in the gulf and southern coast?
--- 2562703
>>2562701
Traveling up the Mississippi is fucking hazardous as fuck due to all the cargo traffic. Very few places you can actually moor to the banks. Even if you find a spot, you have to have a fuckton of slack in lines because said cargo ships will slam your shit around.
--- 2562737
>>2562703
right, I'm not suggesting that they go backwards. but can't you change your starting place or date to avoid hurricanes?

I'm in my late twenties and have owned three sailboats so far, from 28 to 36 ft which was a lot of boat for one person. None of them have cost particularly much to maintain, and when you see some of the boats people are sailing around on you quickly realize that the idea that there is a rule saying boat ownership always is expensive is ridiculous.

Take some time to identify the most expensive single components of a boat (engine, rigging, sails) and learn what the signs of excessive wear and/or imminent need for replacement is. These can be simple or complicated systems depending on many factors, mainly the size of the boat, but generally you can either pay with your time in advance or pay either in time or money afterwards when fixing things that could have been avoided. For a liveaboard boat you may want to learn about and pay extra attention to things like electrical systems, plumbing, gas systems etc as well.
Here is a great resource to start with: http://www.pcmarinesurveys.com/Marine%20Survey%20101.htm

When you find a boat that ticks all your boxes and buy it, preventative maintenance is key. Preventative maintenance is a lot cheaper than repairs. Stay on top of replacing/refreshing things like engine and gearbox fluids, filters, sacrificial anodes, running rigging, sail UV protection and so on. Keep up with maintenance like polishing and waxing the topsides and deck (where it doesn't have anti-slip/teak), keep your sails under UV covers whenever you aren't sailing, always tie up and fend off your boat properly and you'll save yourself money and headaches in the long run.

OR you could let someone else do all these things for you, in which case yes it will be very expensive to own a boat. But the vast majority of boat owners aren't rich people and if they can make ends meet on the water then so can you. I speak from experience, I'm definitely not rich but I love sailing and put in the hours to make it work.

get a good filter for your little cistern, rainwater even in remote places like the deep Yukon and open Indian Ocean is contaminated with PFAS and it will only be worse near population centers

similar concerns with living off of fish, mercury accumulation could be an issue and the damage to your nervous system is not treatable after the fact

this is mostly just pertinent to someone living off of collected rainwater/caught fish, occasional consumption isn't a big concern but day in/day out exposure will add up over years

For my first boat I bought a sloop rigged one with an encapsulated keel and an outboard.
It had a simple electrical system, very limited plumbing and no gas system which meant it was a great learner-boat. I'd highly recommend something similar rather than buying a boat suitable for living on (with the complexity it brings) as your first boat.

A word of caution is that great learner-boats often have had other people learning on them as well, so doing a thorough inspection is extra important before buying. Not necessarily to deter you from buying, but because it can give you an edge in the discussion of price. When you fix these things later you will learn how to do it properly as well which is an added bonus.

I think a year is a somewhat short timeframe to move onto a boat full time, but it's definitely not impossible. It will just be a steeper learning curve so as long as you're up for that, there's no problem.

Holy shit I can't believe thread is still up.

Ended up canceling classes because of scheduling bs with my job. On top of that, >>2562211 is pretty on the money. The cost of simple maintenance is a lot of money. I'm only 20 with 30k or so, it's just too much risk right now. 

Smaller boats look nice to learn on so if I get the chance or find a good deal I might do that. Too much maintenance is really the main issue here. But I did learn a lot from here that's otherwise useful so thank you :)

>>2562107 (OP)
Well you don't technically need any experience at all. If you find some podunk marina that allows live aboards, just go buy a 70s pile of shit on craigslist for $1500 hang up some tarps and a laundry line, and move on in. Congrats, you're a liveaboard.

Now if you want a halfway decent boat and to go sail to cool places, that's a different matter.

Honestly the best first step is not buying a boat at all. Rather, join a yacht club and sail on other people's boats. All the fun with none of the expenses and headaches, and people are always looking for crew.
--- 2564470

Go to the yacht club and sign up for crew on someone else's boat. There are always people looking for crew.

>The cost of simple maintenance is a lot of money.
I'm curious about this statement; what do you classify as "simple maintenance" and "a lot of money"?
I'm asking because this isn't my experience at all from when I was in my early twenties and owned a 28 footer.

Just get a large dinghy. I bought this O'Day daysailer off FB marketplace for 2k in February. I have been out every weekend since and have already learned enough to be comfortable in most conditions. Sailing a dinghy with a main and headsail is very similar to a larger boat, except you will gain more experience sailing in adverse conditions. 17mph winds feel like 30 on a small boat.

Okay guys, just had my first class lesson today. As I was going to cancel it turned out the introduction class was delayed, and my work schedule finally updated. I will be learning with a designated partner on a small dingy.

I'm not sure if I'm still going to stick with sailing after the course but I'm thinking something like a 25 Catalina 25 is my best option, large enough to "live" in but small enough to sail myself with a year's of experience. 

Not really anything notable, just an update on the progress. Will keep updating if there is interest.

Glad to hear it, I hope the classes go well! Good luck, it's easy going and you'll have a blast.
--- 2566536
how was the class anon - what sort of class was it?
--- 2566603
>>2566219
>>2566536
The class was a basic introduction, I went to a library meeting room with a bunch of boomers. Instructor went through the basics, such as the names of boat parts, some knots, and how to perform various actions on the boat.

The content itself seems complex but clearly you learn it best on the water, which the first of those lessons is coming up Saturday. Will update on that.

start with a van life build first. that way is alot cheaper. though you have to shit in a hole.

You should read Two Years Before the Mast by Dana

Its very good, and fascinating, probably the best book about sailing ever written.

Just went on my very first sailing trip with my dad who got his license about a year or two ago and has gone on 2-3 one week sailing trips so far.
We only sailed along the Mediterranean coast and had fairly nice whether, but after he explained a couple of things to my brother and me I think we made a decent crew and could handle most situations we ran into.
I imagine sailing alone (as your post implies) is harder than with two helpers, but from what I've seen and learned this week I can imagne that if you spend a year or two to actively prep for this, you can get by pretty alright and I think from there on out it's just about gathering experience
--- 2568082
>>2568030
Yeah it definitely seems that starting off on no matter what size or kind of boat, you will need assistance to begin with.

So today was the first on water class. We sailed some small hunter 140s on a lake with zero fucking wind, so for tack exercises the instructor went ahead and paddled. At first I was tacking rapidly but then I paused between moving the keel in the proper direction, and then moving to the otherside/switching hands. 

I had a but of trouble performing the hitchknot but I managed. Putting the vocabulary into practice was annoying. Other than that, I took my time learning with it and I can gladly say I am glad to be taking the lessons and I just want to keep getting out there and practicing.

Now, my next move after this will be either to join the club and grind out sailing solo, or move onto a different club with larger boats in an inlet. My plan is to become competent at sailing a 25 foot boat.

That's all for today. I'm tired I slept only five hours lol.

Did you grow up on the beach/in the ocean?
--- 2568140
OP here, I bought a bought but I was busy jerking off to trans furry porn below deck and hit a whale. The boat took on water and began sinking but I managed to get it close to shore. But then a tsunami came and buried the boat in sand. Now I'm selling my bussy for $5 an hour for crack in Miami. RIP my life

OP here, wanna-be sailor autist chronicles update:

Indoor lesson today, went over some knots, considering getting a proper hitch so I can learn those knots. I don't have anything close to that shape at home.

Went over gybing, puffs, hiking, etc. stuff to keep in mind for the next water lesson. Hopefully we have wind this time so I can actually fucking practice.

Getting closer though, wagmi
--- 2569243
>>2569202
tacking is based. gybing is gay
--- 2569256
>>2569243
From what we were shown, gybing can be quite dangerous in high winds, and acknowledged chicken-gybing, which is a pretty nice alternative.

Glad you're doing lessons. Sounds like it's a small lake though. If there's any clubs with larger boats available for members, and on a larger body of water, it might be worth paying more for that membership instead. I'm on a good sized lake and my club does all it's basic sail training on Catalina 22s, with Catalina 25s, 27s, and 32s for members to take out once they've gotten the relevent ASA certifications. Wind can be hit or miss in the summer, but in the other months it gets pretty good. It's been great for getting experienced with larger and more complex boats, and hopefully in the next couple years I'll be able to do a weeklong overnight charter somewhere. I want my own boat, but that'll take time and cost a lot to store it since living aboard is not an option for me.
--- 2569879
>>2569866
Yeah, it's not a very big lake at all, it's just what was closest to me. There is another club on the coast with one cat 22 that I want to learn on, I'll search for other clubs in the area too though.

I definitely feel that I can be competent working a 25 foot boat within a year.
--- 2571407
>>2569879
Alright fucktards, shit has been happening.

We got some wind today and while the instructor being pissed I wasn't communicating (it was deserved lol), it was fucking fun. My main issue is reading the water and telltales for wind, and really just multitasking. I did a few good tacks so that was excellent.

We have one final day on the water and one class session in which we take a final. I need to pass these to get membership. It is not quite as optimal as coastal sailing but it is close and that means I can get more practice in.

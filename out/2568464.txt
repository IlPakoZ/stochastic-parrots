I'm a tranny. I sit inside all day looking for threads to post this image on. I have clearly escaped the cycle by refusing to exist within the confines in which the cycle itself exists.

I am superior.

I am immortal.

Just like the tranny meme, this doesn't hurt the people you're trying to hurt. 

I can look down and see my dick. I know I'm not a tranny. Also you can call me a LARPer all you want, I know what I've hiked.

Perhaps it's the idea of caring about what others think of you that makes you so gay. But I don't know. I'm not an indoors tranny.

You are a LARPer

I love to take life advice from losers. 

Do you fbi retards even think before you post?

I don't think they actually do, because the board has seen a measurable decrease in post quality over the years. /out/ is inundated with "I'm le tired of society and I want to run away innawoods" threads, posted by /in/cels that won't actually do something as simple as going outside for the first time. They post about it constantly, but they don't do it. 
In any case >>2568466 is right. This thread just makes OP look like a spastic.

I only go outside to convince myself that I'm not a seething maladaptive daydreamer.

It's all over.

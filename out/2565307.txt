I've been reading about pack goats and they seem to be a good alternative to llamas or mules. They're less expensive and carry more weight than other animals, pound for pound. Goats are also smarter and better natured. I've been around goats enough to know that I like them and can raise them properly. Does anyone here have any direct experience with pack goats? Tell me the downside of pack goats, /out/.

You've been around goats and you think they are well behaved? From the interactions I've had with goats I would expect them to run off, eat your pack, and then collapse your tent in the middle of the night.

There's a reason Satan is depicted with the features of a goat.

Same. Funny little guys and girls. Always getting into something.

Lol

LMAO!

Goats are stubborn dickheads compared to mules (and llamas, from what I’ve heard). If they don’t want to do something, they’re not going to listen to you.

Hand raised goats are very different to farm goats. No one in this thread has been around a hand raised goat. If you get the goat as a kit and raise it yourself. Sleep with it when it's a kid raise it like a dog. It will be a completely different animal to what most people have experienced.

That's been my experience as well. Our Nubian wether was better behaved than most dogs.

Why not get a mule? Goats are bros but they are just too small. I miss my goatbro, he was like a dog but with horns.

This guy is a shepherd who used to have his sheep carry packs like your pic until he made his little house cart thing that he has his ram pull.

Unironically castrate yourself.

I've also been around goats, and I've been headbutted in the ass more than once. When the novelty of them wears off they are belligerent creatures, but maybe it depends on the breed.

I have no issues eating them after dealing with them.

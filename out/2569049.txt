Which fishing methods are popular in america besides Bass and icefishing?
--- 2569051
>>2569049 (OP)
Bass is not a method- its a fish. Are you A bot?
--- 2569054
Is ice fishing even popular in america? I thought that was a canadian/scandanavian thing
--- 2569057
I mean the 90% of fishing Content from america i see is spin fishing for Bass
--- 2569059
>>2569054
Popularity is regional
I fish Salmon. Kokanee in lakes and King and silvers in the ocean. Its not cold enough here to ice fish consistently in winter.
>>2569051
The bots seem to be smarter. Still not bumping.
--- 2569064
So there is no big interest for fishing on big carps or catfish with natural baits
--- 2569069
>>2569057
its all regional. Walleye/Northern/Muskie/ice fishing up north, flyfishing for trout out west. bass fishing down south etc...lots of different fishing going on.
--- 2569072
>>2569064
catfishing is very popular, carp not so much.
--- 2569087

I like using spinners on the river for smallmouth and walleye. 

Everyone else is usually fishing the deeper areas with texas rigs, tubes, etc., but I go further upstream where it's shallow and spin the current seams it's so much fun.

Don't forget the salt. In addition to bigger versions of spinning and bait casters there's flounder gigging, crab trapping, freelining live bait, scallops, cast netting. That's just gulf coast stuff probably a lot more in the northeast or pacific.

Why surf fishing is not popular in the US?
--- 2569109
>>2569049 (OP)
America is as large as continental Europe, you will need to narrow it down quite a bit. Every kind of fishing is done in the US. I live in the western US and trout fishing is more popular than bass fishing, even though there are top class Florida strain bass fishing reservoirs here as well.

Power Bait fishing method, also known as the "boomer method".

>>2569106
huge sparsely populated country, you'll find people surf fishing on any beach at any time of the day, but the nearest beach is a 12 hour drive from where I live
Fishing varies regionally because America varies regionally

Fly fishing if you live outwest and enjoy anal sex

Dynamite. Do you want to fish or do you want to talk about it?
--- 2569461
>>2569350
Yes, I get that but for example, its so weird that people in Florida or Texas will fool around fishing bass when the beach is right there.
Kind of weird

>>2569461
>fishing bass
but bass fishing is fun. Mouse eating large mouth bass are a fine catch.

90% of fishing content is baitcaster fishing for bass.
>>2569106
it's popular in california with light gear, has more in common with european light rock fishing

Warm water fish are shit. There is no point to pull fish out of the ocean when you get something just as big with similar flavor from a river that is more accessible. The water around florida is also shallow--you have to go pretty far to get to the deep water.. so again, if you're fishing shallows for shit fish you might as well do it for 1/4 the price and pull them out of lakes and rivers.
Floridians DO harvest a shit ton of scallops and crab.
--- 2569556
>>2569461
forgot
The gulf of Mexico has shit fish as well. The gulf has the added issue of it creates localized weather systems... so to get to deep enough water to catch shitty warm water fish you are essentially going to where waterspouts and thunderstorms form... to catch a fish that isn't better than what you can pull out of a river or lake.

No one eats bass, they are junk fish just like carp. America is a sport fishing country because we are a bunch of fags. If you want a real /out fishing experience, learn how to fly fish and take an ultralight travel rig with you for river trout. 99%of my overnight backpacking trips are centered around a trout-heavy lake or stream. Great eating and decent fight, plus you actually have to know how to fish to catch one since they only go after live-acting/looking bait

In Northern NY (basically Canada) it’s mainly walleye, pike, musky, yellow perch and largemouth. Caught my fair share of all except a musky, my dad caught a 54 incher last year, got me eager to hook one (local law prohibits you from landing them though).

Fried bass is alright, maybe I’m just poor lol. We eat pike often, though that feels grosser than bass. Walleye is real good eating though

Shore lunch with freshly caught walleye is one of the best meals I have ever had

LOATHE fishing with every cell in my body.

I live in NW Montana, and up until a few weeks ago it was normal to see at least one ice fishing tent up on some of the smaller lakes I live near. Salmon Lake, Seeley Lake, Swan Lake almost always have ice fishing going on in the winter. Otherwise it's fly fishing.

I actually got into bowfishing last year (completely nigger rigged my bow with a soda bottle and duct tape because I was a poorfag who couldn’t afford a bowfishing reel) my girlfriend convinced me to try to cook the carp in pic related. It’s meat was incredibly red and overall it was just kind of weird.

Are you from Wisconsin or Minnesota by any chance that’s quite a popular meal to eat on Friday.
--- 2571653
>>2571458
That's pretty bad ass dude. I'd never think to use a soda bottle and duct tape to rig a reel for a bow, but now I have to do it. Was the carp edible, or did it taste bad, or what?

Paddlefish Fishing is super popular where I come from here in the US and its probably the tastiest freshwater fish I have ever eaten. 
>>2569064
Catfish fishing is based and Catfish is a tasty fish if you know how to bleed them &amp; prepare them correctly. Most people dont bleed their catfish and that is what causes the gamey/muddy taste. You have to either use the sushi cut the tail &amp; the back of the head where it meets the spine technique or you have to have a ice cooler filled with ice and then toss the still alive catfish in the ice cooler and let them die of natural causes as it forces the blood to the catfishes core/guts and you are going to get rid of those leaving nice mostly bloodless fillets that taste clean.

Where do you live? Yes I would say bass fishing is probably the most popular fishing in America, but there's a lot of people who hate it. America is huge, full of lakes, rivers, and surrounded by ocean. I live I the pacific northwest, lots of salmon and steelhead snobs here. Walleye and sturgeon fishing is probably second and my they're my personal favorite. 
>>2569051
It's both. 
>>2569106
It is
>>2569461
Because if youre poor surf rods and reels are prohibitively expensive. Of you're not poor you work too much and live 80 to 100 miles from the ocean, you don't have time to drive to surf or jetty fish.

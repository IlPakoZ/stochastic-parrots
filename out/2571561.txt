Whatever you would wear normally when /out/doors. All the other stuff would require knowing which cryptid you're intending to go after.

>What attire and equipment should I wear while searching for cryptids?

Best way is to dress like a faggot.

Just regular out gear unless you have an idea of what youâ€™re dealing with. Maybe Carey some paranormal entity basics like the Bible, salt, holy water
--- 2571818
>>2571561 (OP)
Basic 10 C's, good side arm and a shotgun, long knife. You'd want steel, silver, enough salt to make a ring, a corked bottle, at least 13 coins, a Latin bible, crucifix, square hammer, holy water, lighter fluid, full sized shovel, a quail (or similar living vessel for transference) , and lastly a relic of a holy person (something as basic as the toe nails of a priest). 

Mind you, none of this will protect you if you go far enough out. I have a theory that we're all hive minded together and if you sever that connection for long enough your brain starts to search for a comparative signal. If you "pair" with a cryptid mind you'll be lost. You'll go feral. Most plebs just starve to death before that point, but if you live then you'll go around the curb.

And what about the attire? Would a regular hiking clothes work or should I be more prepared?

You are going to be dealing with something from the sea of souls, normal rules don't apply. Usually the ritual implication of an object implies it's use with a neverborne or something tainted, for example a knife will carry more significance than a gun, since the knife has been used for a million years longer than a bullet hence more blood has been drawn by the blade than the gun. Time's arrow isn't as important in the sea of souls. 

But it doesn't matter/ why worry about something that is never going to happen. The moment you smell burnt sugar and rotting shit, the moment the bile rises in your throat and you see the impossible rolling from the shadows like rancid fat, you will void you bowels and go away inside, back to that seminal time when you were a newborn, whimpering for your mother, all thoughts of preparation and dynamic action forgotten.

We have never understood the others and we probably never will. We posses the same instincts as fauna to their presence: the sense of wrongness that stills even the cicada and the songbird. The only "solution" to the others is to destroy every jot and tittle of matter and man or beast that has been touched by them. Since the Pharaohs to the present this has been done. Kind, intelligent men have exhausted every option and resorted to this. 
Even if you succeed, or believe you have succeeded, you will be hounded to the ends of the earth, everyone you love will be placed in jeopardy. They will murder thousands to eliminate the possibility of a threat.

Cryptids? These are one of these things you only see overweight people on youtube talk about?
Obese Americans that deepest dive into the woods isn't even getting on the sidewalk, but driving up to the 'haunted' theme park and using their drone for footage from the front seat of their car and then rereading reddit /r/nosleep spam.

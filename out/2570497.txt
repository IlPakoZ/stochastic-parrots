Many of the oldest human structures and settlements were founded on/near cairns; if such a prehistoric practice is "unnatural" and worthy of destruction then you better be consistent and kill every livestock/crop you come across because those are just as ancient and """"environmentally impactful"""".

Certainly not the birds, lizards and insects that used to live there.
The best parts is this, the area had to be closed off for normies. So the normies went up and down the river and started the same there. Took three years to completely destroy the habitats there as well.

So they tried to close these parts as well for normies, which was a big thing as now the river was closed for about 6 or so km and people began to notice.

They had to close the river downstream for people with boats, as there was a constant stream of tourists, buying a 60€ plastic boat and a few crates of beer, going into the water, drifting 10 or 20km down stream. They then popped the boat and threw the bottles and the plastic into the river.

So Tölz-Wolfratshausen has stopped any tourists from going near the river in an attempt to save the last gravel nesting birds, but tourists don't give a fuck. So they started policing the river and handing out fines and that is where we are now.
https://www.lra-toelz.de/wildfluss-isar-wichtige-informationen

This happened over the last 15 or so years, it got worse every year, the gravel nesting birds are fewer and fewer, the river is full of plastic boats and bottles and utterly destroyed over several km and you are fined if you go near the river.

Then you have this idiot, not understanding what is happening and why something gets regulated:
>>2571097
>>wahhhh it'll harm nature
>An ecosystem that can't handle surface stones being moved around wasn't meant to survive.
>>b-b-but leave no trace

The same happens at a greater scale on the entire planet, we will end with everything fucked up and highly regulated.

God bless you in your righteous destruction. One other thing I haven't seen mentioned, cairns can be misconstrued as trail markers, it's happened to my retard ass before. Much as you shouldn't go marking blazes or tying flagging tape on random trees, you shouldn't build cairns where someone might get drawn off-trail. And also why must we always fuck with everything to begin with
--- 2571339
>>2571286
Conservation laws where I live tend to pertain to what you're allowed to do in the area (e.g. hunt, fish, camp, have fires etc.) I don't know of anywhere in Canada that's literally off limits.

I thought rock stacking was a 4chan thing actually. I remember seeing threads on it years ago, then seeing anti-rock stacking PSAs 6 months to a year after those threads started.
The idea was "Africa couldn't even stack rocks" and to bring awareness to how far behind any African technology was.

Birds that nest in rock piles along rivers wouldn't survive in the US due to the predator population. A fox or coyote would have a field day. On top of that we like to add extra non native predators to the mix, like pythons and iguanas, just to make it extra spicy for the native wildlife.

i'm going on a 3 day kayaking trip and i've never been kayaking before. i've been camping a few times like a decade ago but that's it. any advice on supplies and overall making a good impression on the group i'm going with? was thinking of watching tutorials of 
-how to secure cargo to kayak
-finding good camp spot
-making a fire
-pitching a tent

Being a good kayaker is gonna have a bigger impact on your trip than anything else.
Look up how to properly do a forward stroke, using your whole body. This is mainly so you don't get tired and sore as quickly. Most paddlers only pull with their arms and gas themselves. 
Getting an idea of edging turns in the boat and how to do a low brace may also be helpful. Don't worry about rolls, if you've never been before I doubt they're gonna bring you anywhere that it'll be a huge issue.
All the other stuff is fairly easy to just learn as you. Assuming this is guided or you have people that are experienced, they'll prob handle the camp stuff for you.

use plastik bags to store your food/clothes/camping gear waterproof. you don't want to sleep in a wet sleeping bag. bring 2 lighters with you in case one gets lost. don't sleep next to the river you don't want to get waked by a rising river in case that it start's raining, go a bit away from it (higher ground and even if its just a bit to give you some time to relocate your tent)

Take the pedal-canoe pill.
The comfort levels of using your legs compared to paddling is night and day. Everyone in your group will be jelly as you just chill riding along the water while they're splashing about and tiring their arms.

just learn basic paddle strokes. sweep stroke being most important so you can efficiently turn instead of looking like a retard. also, don't lean out of the kayak and you won't tip.

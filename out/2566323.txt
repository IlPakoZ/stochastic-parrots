wrong. its literally the best state. no sales tax. high desert, temperate rainforest, costal dunes, juniper woodlands, steppe, and alpine. the state has a very large percentage of publicly accessible land.

I’ve only done one destination hike by flying rather than driving, and it was in Oregon. 
>light rail from the airport to Gresham (suburbs)
>bus from Gresham to Sandy (tiny mountain town)
>pubic shuttle to Timberline Lodge
Other than the flight, it’s about three hours of travel, including a quick stop in Portland to buy stove fuel, so basically an entire day just to get there. There are private shuttles straight there, but you’re only saving maybe an hour of time and they’re crazy expensive. 

I want to do a trip to Bend, than a bus to Sisters to hike the Three Sisters Loop, but I’m afraid of hitch hiking (less being murdered and more just not being picked up). I might just do a private shuttle, but I don’t know. It’s been a few years because Oregon was retarded with Covid restrictions.

>>2568769
He gave examples of why it’s not a shithole, specifically environmental diversity. Can you explain why he’s wrong and why Oregon is bad? Use your words.

Oregon is truly a fucking shithole and you honestly shouldn’t even bother.
CA has way more diversity and tons of outdoor stuff.

Dear Mr. Putin,
When you nuke the U.S. please make sure you annihilate Portland, Salem, Eugene, Corvallis, Bend, and Ashland. 

Thank you in advance, and godspeed.

Dear God,
Please smite all the pot growers in Oregon. Also, could you please make another Hell but with 10x more red hot poker in the ass for them? 

Thank you and God bless.

Trump won Marion County (Salem) in 2016. Clinton won Lane County (Eugene) with 56%. Multi mag County always surprised me, because I thought let it would have been Clinton with at least 85% (it was 73%, which is a landslide still, but I expected worse).

Yeah it's a red state that is why they pass the most severe gun laws in the country.
At least be honest with yourself. It's a beautiful state that is going to continue increasingly be dominated by Portland's absurd politics.
--- 2570012
>>2570006
Portland passed that. Again, Oregon is a red state without the people’s republic of Portland.

But you’re right; greater Idaho needs to happen.
--- 2570013
>>2570001
Marion County is about 50/50 conservative/liberal scum, but it's a shit place for outdoor stuff anyway, as is the whole Willamette Valley. You find yourself hunting nutria and wonder where you went wrong. You seem to think Oregon might someday lean more conservative but it won't. The election process is rigged to hell in favor of communism.
--- 2570019
>>2570012
It ain't just Portland, bubba. There's as many biden voting fucktards in the rest of the state as there are in pdx. Hell, La Grande and Burns have a lot of commies.
--- 2570033
>>2570012
>greater Idaho needs to happen
Keep holding your breath. State of Jefferson has a better chance of happening. I have no skin in the game because I left years ago when it became obvious what was happening. Just be realistic about things - you look like a goof when you start talking about Hail Mary's like redrawing state lines or creating new states to escape the inevitable.

it would be bragging to list out all the awesome outdoor stuff within walking/biking distance, let alone under 1 hour of driving

but alas, it doesn't make up for the progressives hell bent on ruining the state.

stop stereotyping me because i live in oregon, you filthy suburbanite.
>>2570145
oregon is great
the willamette valley is also great
however, roughly 70% of the people are trash.

You dumb motherfucker, I put 250,000 miles on my truck exploring Oregon. I hunted, fished, hiked, and camped in Oregon for 28 years and I've seen more of Oregon than you'll ever dream about. I can tell you more about the Willamette Valley than your atrophied brain can absorb, ya fuckin toolbag.
--- 2570261
>>2570153
Why would you explore the Willamette valley when “the whole Willamette Valley is a shit place for outdoor stuff?” Sounds like a waste of time.

>retard alert
State of jefferson head kneeled to state of greater idaho for having a higher likelihood.
Oregon would just need votes from governor, state, federal and president.
Only way jefferson forms is if california and oregon seceded and we get a west virginia situation in which case youd see greater idaho anyways.
In greater idaho vote, every county west of klamath voted against speaking of greater idaho. Too many cali retirement boomers unable to let go.

What will be the legacy of yours, you filthy little cunt.
I know it’s pathetically weak bait by a brain dead zoomie, but being alive at the same time as politicians and their unelected appointees doesn’t make one responsible for their fuckups/malice.
--- 2570334
>>2570289
LMAO yeah you only need the governor (who doesn't approve), the state (who doesn't approve), the federal government (who doesn't care/doesn't approve) and the president (who doesn't care/doesn't approve) and it's a win!!
What a fucking goofball.

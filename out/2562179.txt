what's the point of them?
>open, bugs wander in and out
and uh that's all i can think of at the moment but regardless though tents are better. The only pro of the tarp is low profile and extremely cheap.

It’s a Southwest/California/we know it’s not going to rain/bugs don’t live here thing. You can try it in the south then for some reason it storms in October and you wake up with a chigger infestation. 

That said, a tarp and bug bivy combo is both lighter and cheaper than most tents, and solves the bug problem.

ventilation. I can keep my propane buddy heater running as long as I want with no carbon monoxide worries. don't need to worry about bugs if it's cold enough for the heater.

I just bought an 8x10 ft tarp. Anybody know some good pitches?
--- 2562260
>>2562200
>That said, a tarp and bug bivy combo is both lighter and cheaper than most tents
Lighter maybe if you buy a good tarp and not a heavy DD standard, because it’s not fully enclosed, but that makes it worse for storms.
It’s not really significantly cheaper tho.
A borah bug bivy and decent 20D tarp will still be $150-$180.
A lanshan 1 is definitely cheaper than that, and an x-mid 1 is only $220, and you can actually sit upright in those.

>>2562260
The tarp is more compact than just about any tent. So if you're trying to save on pack space, tarps are the way to go. The spectacular ventilation also prevents my stuff from getting damp overnight.
>>2562240
Bingo. Tarps work really well for winter camps if you don't want to spring for a hot tent. It's way less weight than a hot tent as well. It's more fuss, considering the fire is harder to maintain, but the cost-effectiveness and versatility is hard to beat.
I wouldn't dream of taking my tarp above the treeline. But for any other terrain it's really good. It's light, compact, cheap, and lets you pitch a quick shelter wherever there's enough of a windbreak. That's the strength of a tarp.
>>2562246
I like pic rel for solo camping. Just stake in the middle of the farthest side, stake out both near corners, pitch the middle of the near side to a tree, and adjust the stake tension. Roll the spare flaps underneath the shelter.

They protect you and your gear from the elements. I use a tarp for chilling in the daytime and a tent for sleeping in. Also this is a bad thread and you should feel bad. Use your critical thinking faculty before making any more stupid threads please.

I actually was camping with my eldest son during Hurricane Ida in '21. It was only a tropical storm by the time it got this far north but it was still a solid 36 hour downpour with gusts over 30mph. I re-pitched our mess fly much lower to the ground so it would at least keep shit covered, and we hunkered down in the tent. 550 Paracord held that fly in place no problem. Might not be hurricane-proof but it's close enough for this side of the Appalachians.
--- 2562614
>>2562613
Makes you wonder what kind of winds these other anons are camping in that they claim 550 can't handle
>"heh, you haven't camped in constant 100mph winds? Guess you don't go /out"
--- 2562617
>>2562614
To be fair to the other anon, it's possible I wouldn't have had to change the pitch if I was using Dyneema cord. Then again, it's possible that it would have been fine with the paracord, too.
--- 2562620
>>2562527
It is enough to make your tarp droop. 550 was a fad that quickly died among people who actually camp because of this, but it lived on via retarded YouTube survivalist crap.
--- 2562630
>>2562620

Because it was dirt cheap, once upon a time. I'm still working through the spool my dad bought in the late 90s.

--- 2562655
>>2562634
Yes, it was a fad. It’s not because I don’t use it. It was popular despite its shortcomings, and now it’s not. That pretty much the definition of a fad.
--- 2562675
>>2562655
>a thing is no longer popular because I don't like it
Except for the fact that it's readily available everywhere you go and lots of people use it with no complaints, yeah, totally not popular, kek
--- 2562677

I use 550 for nearly everything and have never had a problem.

you just let them bite you right after they appear so you get used to them and wont get any pimples or rashes later in the year and then you just live with them 
nothing aggravates me more than seeing grown men always act like little girls constantly shouting and complaining loudly while waving their hands while /out/, always ruins my good time

It's easy to say stuff like that when you've never experienced it first-hand.

>nothing aggravates me more than seeing grown men always act like little girls constantly shouting and complaining loudly while waving their hands while /out/, always ruins my good time
That's why you go prepared. You don't just "let them bite you" unless you're a larper who never leaves their basement.

--- 2563463

kelty or lawson. 1mm and 1.5mm in 3 seasons, 2.5 or 3mm when its cold. the thin stuff is very strong but becomes troublesome to knot in the cold. generic dyneema cordage isn't as flexible its worth paying more for the nylon sleeved name brand stuff. how thin you should go is pretty much directly proportional to how much you're willing to let knot tying become a pain in the ass in exchange for weight/bulk. 
i use atwood micro cord for almost everything else except guylines.

I made some shock cord guylines (not for the ridgeline obviously) but probably half the time I forget them and use whatever I do have which is usually paracord or hemp rope.

i dont really like his system, i find a truckers hitch a bit too fiddly and annoying to tie sometimes so i usually do bowline to attach to the stakes and then i attach the other end to my tarp with a tautline hitch
this way you can keep the bowline tied all the time use the same bowline for wrapping the cord, con of this is that you cant keep the rope attached ot the tarp the whole time and keep it in the bag but i dont find that it bothers me
--- 2563489
>>2563484
>i find a truckers hitch a bit too fiddly and annoying to tie sometimes
forgot to mention but i use 1.3mm dyneema cord with polyester sheathe so theyre very slippery, with a tautline i wrap it around itself 3-4 times as opposed to twice to add more friction but bowline knots work as normal, i also often use a double fishermans knot if i need to extend the guylines

--- 2563762
>>2563257
either this or just use a proper repellant. For me its mostly ticks im worried of, but some ballistol bug repellant worked for me. also when having a campfire you could use some resin rich woods for the atherical oils to repell them. Or just stop giving a fuck. A lil bug won't stop me outings

What kind of net for bugs do you recommend?

--- 2563840
>>2562179 (OP)

Sitting there all fucking day and night when its raining and not being cooped up in a tent is great. You can stand up if you set it up right. Just the other week I watched a thunderstorm pass through the mountains from my tarp 600m up a steep hillside from the river below, pouring rain, dry as can be and the lightning was glowing up all the cloud particles and the forest like we were inside a light bulb. Freaking amazing, my father missed most of it from in his tent. 

Then I went to sleep in my bivy. The next day we had a large area of dry ground under the tarp, excellent.
--- 2563841
>>2563840

Oh and we hadn't been able to get to a water source because the storm changed our plans which stopped us going over the top of the mountain. So the tarp can catch a lot of water in a situation like that, it lasted us enough to get back to water which was 2 days after the rain had stopped.
--- 2563975
>>2562314
I will try this pitch next time. I need to stop being such a fair weather fairy
--- 2564007
>>2563841
Why not just catch the rain water? Thats literally why a tarp is so great

Your post complained about not being able to reach a water source because you were being rained on. The water source is right above you
--- 2564274
>>2564198

No, the post was explaining that the tarp makes it easy to catch water. Read it again slowly. "So the tarp can catch a lot of water in a situation like that" and catch a lot of water it did. 
Also there's no complaining.
--- 2564279
>>2564007
Newbie here, how do you attach the bug net to the tarp? Bug nets in my country are things you put over windows, they are inflexible and stiff, not exactly a net but more of a mesh.
--- 2564280
>>2564279
>Le bug net

--- 2564302
>>2564279
Some tarps will have a loop or loops in the inside. If you use a trekking pole to prop it up inside you can tie it to that.
--- 2564312
All you need is something to sleep in, something to sleep on, and something to sleep under.

Everything else is totally unnecessary. Don't be a bougie retard
--- 2564330

Pic is the Borah Gear bug bivy. The guy lines that hold the bug net up attach to the same poles that hold up the tarp, or are anchored to the same point as the poles. I don’t like this particular design, but you get the idea.

5'9 but its nice since it means i can buy chink gear for nearly 100usd less than the borah stuff kek

You can use them on inclines. More versatile than a bivy. A symmetrical tarp can be pitched as a tent with a floor.

--- 2567204
>>2567143
Yeah, but this trip >>2563803
ended up being the worst possible scenario: snow, then rain, then subfreezing overnight, and my brother forgot his tent for himself. We were fine, even with my absolute dogshit setup.
Just showed me I need to spend more time outside in bad weather, and the way you pitch that three sided shelter is just how I am going to do it so I can stay comfy.

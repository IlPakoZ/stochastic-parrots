I wonder how much of /out/ has had some involvement with boy scouts. 

Share your good or bad experiences.

Good :
-learning cool song 
-bullying the younger one by spreading disinformation or telling them to look for thing that don't exist 
- cool war reanactment with the boys inawood 

Bad :
- Middle class christian cringe
- Some verry retard people

Overall 8/10, would do it again
But I don't think I gonna send my son there, thing don't seem to be as good now.

It’s all a factor of the adult involvement. 

There was almost no heavy handed Christianity when I was in Scouts. We prayed before meals, stated that a Scout is reverent, and kept God in the pledge of allegiance, but that was about it. I think it’s because everyone here is Catholic rather than a false religion (all others). 

We went on campouts once a month, with day trips (not always inna woods) interspersed between. There was always something going on. It was usually car camping, but still a good time. The few backpacking trips we went on were pretty bad due to the adults not knowing their assholes from their elbows. 

It all went downhill after a national “urban outreach” program resulted in a lot of low income inner city kids joining.

Interesting...I never considered that religion would be a big part of some troops traditions. For me it was pretty tame for the most part.
>before going on /out/ings I could recall and no changing of the pledge(didn't know people took offense to that). Favorite moments on a trip? The time we cooked a ribeye over an open fire, that was fun.

I was part of it for one year, me and another boy always wrestled each other and fought and the other boys would cheer us on, like two monkeys fighting for everyone’s amusement, we enjoyed it and so did the other boys, who would occasionally jump in and quickly tap out, but always laughing and having a good time. Eventually we were both told to not come back because all we did was fight. Looking back, we never had any adult supervision and if it was 2023 we probably would have been encouraged to do it naked and invite into the young leader program.

I learned nothing.

Second best time of my life was scout outings. Rafting trips had us forming boarding parties, and attempting to throw the crews of other rafts into the river while shouting pirate slogans. Tackling a nigga off the other raft worked until I tried it on an older scout, and he caught me midair, and threw me overboard. We sang shanties too.
Canoe trips saw us getting lost, turning down the wrong section of river, having to hop out and run carrying a canoe over a quarter mile of woodland not to get left behind. Felt like special forces work.
Hiking trips saw us learning navigation, basic herbalism, fishing, trapping, knot tying, the works. Any basic skill for /out/ing was either taught by an older scout, or learned by experiance.
 Retard forgot the frying pan? No problem. Go to the riverbed and find a large, flat rock. 
Hail shredded the tents? No problem. The adults brought sewing kits. Get crackin, boys.
Guy suddenly gets apendicidas mid 30 mile hike and cant walk? Welp, looks like we're rotating hand made stretcher duty, and who carries his stuff.
Bored in camp? Organize patrols into factions, give them sticks, and have them larp as midieval kingdoms, waring with eachother, learning how battles work.
Two kids get mad at eachother? Wait till the adults are gone and settle it in a scuffle.
Good times. Great people. I do have to say though, pretty much everything I described cant happen anymore. Complete policy overhauls, from what I understand. When my older brothers did it, they would hunt, and cook what they caught, whether it was legal or not (heavy emphasis was placed on respect for wildlife). When I was in, we did the shot above, and more. I just talked to one of the older guys in the troop I was from a week or so ago. He was just joining when I was leaving. Appearantly, they dont camp anywhere without power and running water now, and God help you if you get in a fight.

Did it, it was like a fucking arts and crafts class, and we rarely did any actual /out/ stuff. Stupid ceremonies.

That is unfortunate Anon. That reminds me of when I went on a camping trip with my sisters girl scout troop as a chaperone. Literally spend 100% of the time doing shitty volunteer work.

That's cool few words away from KGATLW. I had many patrol's I was apart of the Black Mustangs, Labyrinth, Raven, and "Green Bar" (Like a separate patrol of just the SPL, ASPL's, and Instructor). 

But also scouts was awesome for me getting to Eagle my sister doing it as well. Going to a World Jamboree and meeting people from all around the world and even getting the chance to talk to someone on the ISS while there. Working as a manager at my local scout camp. Doing the dumbest shit late at night with good friends. Meeting some of the people in my life I honestly could say I see as brothers not just friends. It was a great program and I loved every second of it.

Life Scout got out when 18
Good:
-Met good friends
-Had fun
-Learned responsibility
-Improved as a person
-Cheap
-Outdoors stuff is rad

Bad:
-The cliques that exist in school are there too, not really nerds vs jocks or anything, but rich vs poor. 
-Not all troops are created equal

it sucked ass but I think that was just my troop.
> joined boyscouts with a good amount of outdoors experience
> used to own an old 1940s boyscout handbook that had a lot of cool shit ranging from how to use camouflage properly to how to make fresh water fish traps
> was expecting cool shit like going innawoods, hanging out with the boys, shooting guns and learning more about nature and such
> mfw all we learnt the whole time I was there was how to not get diddled by the scout master and how to memorize stupid pledges
> mfw the only innawoods thing we did was a walk on the local bike path
I quit after a good couple of months, we didnt even get to go to summer camp. desu just dont join if you still have a chance, and dont put your kids in either, just buy the 1940s handbook and go by yourself or with friends.

Youre experience sounds a bit similar to my own. We love to romanticize the past but I cannot even begin to recall the amount of times we were taught the same 3 knots because of lack of actual planning ahead of time. All that I have retained in my memory in spite of how often we practiced them was the square knot. I partially blame this for the slow decline of the troop.

Eagle here, the best part is the middle ground when you aren't like a scout or tenderfoot but before life or Eagle (unless you're one of those 14 year old eagles). If you give half a shit you will learn important /out/ stuff while hanging out with friends, hearing funny stories and making your own. Looking back I had a hell of a time and would do it all over again in a heartbeat, the pros mentioned by everyone else pretty much applies: friends, fun, outdoors, etc.

Idk about now though, I feel like the Troop matters more than anything because nobody cares about what national thinks anymore, but that means that if you're in a bad troop you're kind of sol. A good troop with good friends will usually lead to some fun experiences innawoods.

My cousin and I joined boyscouts. My dad got weird vibes from one of the instructors. He pulled me out. A couple years my cousin was molested. Not much was done, the guy was basically forced to leave town and not really punished as he shouldve been (tortured and killed).

Cousin seemed okish for awhile, but now he's a bad drug addict and life is train wreck. He got endocarditis and has really fucked himself up.

It was mainly positive
>Good:
All leaders were ex mil and forced strict fitness and grooming discipline
Almost weekly camping trips 
Learned how to shoot all types of guns
Learned how to hunt
Focus on faith and duty 
Boy scout camp was awesome, rip Paul Bunyan
High adventure was awesome
Great group of guys to hang out with at school and church
Eagle scout felt like a big accomplishment
>Bad:
Cringe Indian mystic shit at bigger events with the area council
Council being horribly mismanaged 
One helicopter mom that would come to events uninvited 
Retarded kid from Kazakhstan that was cool 80% of the time but spazzed out randomly. Had retard strength and endurance so he pulled his weight.
My troop being shut down for kicking people out who were lazy or future school shooters.

I jerked off my friend on a cabin camping trip to see if I was gay. Also took his ADHD pills on a separate trip. Got my Eagle and brain damage. Hoping to give back to the troop but non-sexually
--- 2567923
The good, tied some knots, went camping once, made a fire.
The bad, got gaped by three mormons.

Got my Eagle at 15.

I was lucky to join a troop with a heavy focus on camping, because I don't think I would have stuck it out otherwise. The troop was about 14 scouts when I joined, and had the unfortunate trait of being made up of a handful of jocks and a revolving door of younger scouts. Add a certified sperg (yours truly) into the mix, and you can see why the situation turned caustic fast. I stuck around though, because I liked going camping 8 months out of the year, doubted the situation in another troop would be any better, and was going to get Eagle if it killed me, dammit!

It hardly mattered anyways. Shortly after I joined, the Cub Scout pack that fed our troop dried up, and we never really managed to get a significant inflow again. Couple that with an aging membership that wasn't nearly as ambitious as I was, and it was a generally miserable experience. By the time I got Eagle, the troop was down to 5 people and hadn't been camping in almost a year. The troop officially folded two months later, so I was officially the last Eagle out of my troop.

I've been a solo camper ever since. No company is better than bad company. And for an autist, all company is bad company.

I was in Civil Air Patrol, but there were a lot of boy scouts that were part of both them and C.A.P. They seemed to enjoy it, but never shared experiences for some reason

Was in the Scouts (Australian) from 8-16. Some of my favourite experiences and memories. We went camping a lot and it is the reason I love the outdoors. Quite frankly being in the Scouts made me who I am today. Have many stories, a few I've told on this board before. 

Whether or not Scouts is good is based entirely on your leaders and the troop you're in.
I was lucky to be in a good group with good leaders. There were shithead kids of course, clearly only there because their parents were sick of them, but a good portion of the other kids were there because they loved it like I did.

Some of the best camps were the ones where we were given primarily free time. We would always find fun shit to do, chasing 'aborigines' through the bush, throwing shit down hills, etc.

A good memory:
>be me, like 8
>first Scout camp, excited to do cool innawoods stuff, caving and shit
>starts fucking pouring
>be sad, really wanted to have a campfire but leaders say no
>whatever.jpg
>go to bed
>wake up later in the night, need to piss
>leave my tent and look up
>the most beautiful sight I have ever seen in my whole eight years of life
>clear night sky, stars everywhere
>remember describing it later on as like 'gems in a blanket' or something similar
That moment was what got me hooked on camping and the outdoors and I haven't turned back since.

Another good moment:
>on 'survival camp' aka leaders hid food in the bush and we had to go find it or go hungry
>fun as fuck, go swimming and catching yabbies in nearby dam, building our own bushtoilet, etc.
>last day, leader comes and wakes us up at like 4am
>wtf.jpg
>we all go sit on a ridge outlooking the lake we're camping by and watch the sun rise over the hills in the distance
>cold as fuck, but so worth it

Not sure if it was just my troop or because I did Australian Scouts, but there was never any religion in our group at all.

You went to world Jambo as well? That was my last outing as a scout, and it'll stick with me for the rest of my life. I had so much fun meeting other scouts from around the world. One of the guys in my troop slept with a few Slovenian girls lmao

2020 eagle scout
The best times we had was always when nothing was going on and you just had an excuse to hang out with kids your age with minimal supervision and have fun doing stupid shit. 

The downside is that most adult leaders/chaperones are there specifically because they want to be a petty little tyrants and yell at other people's kids. The vast majority of our time was split between useless lectures, fake indian ceremonies, and christ-patriotism wank. We still had the occasional card game or w/e but it was hard to actually have fun with the other kids when even picking up a walking stick would result in a 2-hour autistic freak out from the wannabe drill sergeant dads watching over you.

Ranking up is mostly bureaucracy hell but being an eagle scout really does help later in life.

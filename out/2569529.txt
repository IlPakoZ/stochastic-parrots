Kek that was just like me on Shasta. 
The normies rent $2k worth of stinky plastic boots and helmets with Jerry Curl juice in them and get in the conga line like the good goy they are.
They all take the same route and get thumped by rock and ice from the nerds above them.

When I collected the summit pass and told the qt ranger lady my proposed route she said, "Oh you'll never make it up that way, it's all scree and you'll posthole the whole way". What a dingbat. Do I look like a leppy or something? Sheeeeeit

Just because sometimes you can walk up a glacier solo in running shoes, doesn't mean it isn't a terrible idea. 

The purpose of traveling in a rope team like that is because it is the only way to protect against crevasse falls. If you are solo and fall through a snow bridge, you are essentially dead.

--- 2570557
>>2570547
Agreed but there's some grey area between going lighter and giving your toothbrush the big chop.
He's also implying that you can't make distance without being UL, which is a load of shit. The will and endurance of the person makes a bigger difference than a pound or two in the pack. 
By UL logic, bigger people can't hike because they're already out of the twig category, and I know some big dudes that are beasts in the woods. Hell every timber faller I know can out-hike every nerd in this bread and they could do it carrying a 20 lb saw.

Cause you know you can take that damn mountain and you don't need some gatekeeper to mentally dominate you or some fancy gear to give you the confidence.

You know you can climb Mount Shasta, so you climb it. That's it, dead simple. But you could just solo hike or find other hardcore climbers. I mean you could lead your own climb, you are like a sherpa at this point.

It's weird to have this awkward interaction with "the goys" or the "normiesphere"as you call them, by the way I am a Christian not a goy, and I wish you the best in your mountain climbing adventures. Would recommend just hiking established trails or planning a solid route on a map with a compass, or some electric navigation doodad, or at least getting your bearings with the sun and stars.

Wow, you are right, they look like morels at first glance, but now that you point it out, these appear similar to Early False Morel or Verpa Bohemica.

Easily distinguishable if you cut them open, it is not hollow inside, and you can get the spore print. But you should be very careful to identify it, because there are multiple morel lookalikes that could be toxic.

The cap also hangs off the stem, another sign of Verpa bohemica. I believe it is eaten cooked in small amounts as food, but can be toxic in larger amounts.

This causes me to physically recoil in pain because I’ve experienced this before. There used to be a trail that was popular locally and I hiked it when I was a kid. My sister who lived hours away wanted to bring her friend from the city to this favorite trail on the weekend. So she invites me and we head out there and it’s like the pic. So many cars. I was internally distraught. I don’t usually do anything out on the weekends because of the tourists, but this made me lose it. I had never seen it so bad before. If I had a rifle I would’ve started shooting. But that wasn’t necessary as a year or so later a family of 9 Mexican tourists were killed in a flash flood nearby.

This is almost exclusively a Coastie ci plaint. There are trails further away, but people are too lazy to drive. Everyone near GSMNP knows it gets crowded, so instead of complaining we go to places that aren’t crowded. We just have to drive a little further or hike a little more.

I’m from Arizona. And yes I usually don’t hike those types of trails or hike on the weekend for that reason. But regardless I don’t want it nor like it.

Mushrooms will provide protein, berries can provide energy from sugar and a bit of carbs. In Alabama, lot of swamps and areas have cattails, their roots are actually a great source of carbs.

Kind of related, I’m new to out stuff but every time I go out my parents are freaked out bc they think I’ll die or something bc I’m in the woods alone, even other people I talked to when I mention that I go innawoods they’re like omg you go alone without an organized group that makes you pay 200 for a weekend innawoods it’s dangerous, omg you sleep outside and not in a refuge it’s dangerous, ong what if a snake enters your sleeping bag while you sleep etc

Idk it seems most people live on rails so to speak, in fact, although not out related, I think a lot of laws are respected just because people are mentally programmed to stay in their lane and get uncomfortable by even suggesting doing something illegal even if it’s a minor thing, a lot of time I see people make up rules that don’t even exist out of concern and limiting themselves even more

Goyim is a derogatory term used by Jews to describe gentiles, that is, people that are not Jewish.

Anon, i have bad news for you. A month of being lost in woods means you are retarded. All she had to do was pick a random direction and walk for a few days, eventually you come to a river, train tracks, a street or any other kind of man made structure.

This is true in Alabama, but it's not true if you get lost somewhere that's actually remote like the South Coast Track in Tasmania, where you have to fly in then walk for six days to get out again and there's fuck all permanent human settlement anywhere.

The most common advice when you get lost is just stay put and wait for rescue, especially among normalfags. Sometimes it's a good idea and sometimes you need to self rescue but in general "don't get yourself more lost, you don't know how to navigate in the middle of a forest with no landmarks anyway" is a good rule of thumb. 
A month is a bit long to sit around but if you've got water and at least some food and aren't at risk of freezing then there's not too much that can go wrong doing it, and there's a lot that can go wrong if you get excited and take off in a random direction. You're way better off healthy and in a good spot near a clean water source than with a broken ankle and no idea where to drink or sleep.
I don't know what it's like in Alabama but around here it's nearly impossible to actually walk in even a vaguely straight line for more than an hour, the terrain just doesn't allow it, and unless someone has actually specifically practiced wilderness navigation they're a lot worse at it than they think. People die in the mountains all the time for a reason.

But they don't take 4 weeks to do so. 4 weeks is a long, long time walking and not finding anything man made or a river.
FOUR FUCKING WEEKS!

Also a lot of European countries have free travel rights where people can pass through private property, getting a ticket for that would be more of an American thing. Freedom to roam is what they call it.

>Goyim is a derogatory term used by Jews to describe gentiles, that is, people that are not Jewish.

I am completely aware of this and that is exactly what I'm responding to.

In our King James Version of the Bible, we translate "goy" into "heathen" and I'm not a heathen.

I am a Christian, my God is the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, I am bound to His covenant. He has chosen the faithful to enact His will and inherit His kingdom. Not a goy.

East coast retards think anyone outside of their urban hell cares about their shit parks. Olympic National Park is one of the most well known parks outside of Yellowstone and no one calls it ONP--that's retarded. Hell, no one calls Yellowstone YNP. It just goes to show how retarded east coasters are.

It's very easy to avoid crowds in the PNW because there is exponentially more park.

Basically WA and Oregon have more parkland that the entire east coast combined--so park crowding really is, predominantly, an east coast phenomena.

Google “GSMNP” and “PNW” and see what happens. Now try ““ONP” and “YNP.” 

Some acronyms are agreed upon and recognized by everyone l. Well, everyone who’s involved. You guys aren’t involved; you’re new. 

Also I like about 800 miles from GSMNP, in the South.

Yes, you're dumb, we get it.
over 80% of the US. population lives east of the missippi but 90% of the parkland is west of the mississippi...

That means over 80% of the internet traffic looking for parks is looking at 10% of the parks--therefore those 10% of parks will have a higher page rank.

Rocky Mountain NP and Grand Canyon NP, both very common acronyms. You don’t spend much time outside. The Smokey’s are in the South, which is most certainly not the East Coast. 

Can someone post pictures of crowded areas on the East Coast that aren’t due to limited parking?
--- 2574018

4 hours from Nashville, Atlanta and Charlotte. Seems pretty accessible compared to a lot of western NF’s. The discussion originated from me complaining about my NF, which is two hours from ONE similar sized city. And it’s not even a NP. I can’t imagine how much worse it must be at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park!! Presumably it’s pretty bad since anon thought that’s the place I was talking about for no reason at all. What people back east apparently don’t understand is, I don’t want to run away from the overpopulation problem, I want it to be solved. City folk should stay there.

The funniest thing about east coast overcrowding is that once you go more than 5km away from a parking area most of the people are gone. Yosemite gets 3.5 million visitors a year, and 3 million of them must just fuck around in the visitor centre or do the short flat walks.

It’s bad all over. The Smoky’s are free to enter but they started requiring a parking pass this year. Yosemite is on the West Coast, and it’s 4 hours from Los Angeles (18.7 million people). Zion is in the SW and is the Disney World of National Parks, and is absolutely the king of overcrowding. It’s not even close. It’s so crowded that there’s talk about requiring reservations for all visitors. Not for certain attractions; you’ll have to reserve your spot just to enter. It will definitely keep the crowds down and piss off a lot of people who drove two hours from Las Vegas. The Grand Canyon is always jammed with cars and traffic has been a problem since the place opened, but once you find a parking spot anywhere in the park you’re good. There’s a free shuttle that passes every 15 minutes so you don’t need to drive anywhere. 

It’s all about knowing when to go and not being a retard. Pic is late September (gorgeous weather) at the most crowded attraction in the Smokey’s. There were maybe half a dozen people mingling around. It was 8:30am. Google “crowded Clingman’s Dome” to see what it looks like at noon on a Saturday.

You basically described the difference between the east and west coast parks.
West cost parks are more numerous and larger so the congestion is at the parking lots. East coast parks are smaller but have more parking--the whole park is overcrowded.
90% of American parks are west of the Mississippi and 80% of the population is east of the Mississippi.
it isn't rocket science but east coasters are pretty retarded.

The problem here I this place is infested with reddlt retards. On /pol/ if someone hates your meme it gets edited and reposted and the edit cycle is what refines the meme to kino.
Redlt idiots don't comprehend this basic process--as evidenced by this thread. i
Instead of editing the meme they bitch about it in a circle jerk forum and the result is underdeveloped memes and walls of texts from reddlt retards.

Camping with women is always a pain in the ass. They can't carry as much but they want to bring so much shit you'd think they were trying to build a permanent outpost.

Mclouds are pretty cool though. I also like pulaskis. Once I used a rhino, like a small and sharp hoe, while working on a trail with the USFS and it was amazing. I asked my conservation corps why we didn't have any and they said that the rhinos are really expensive and since a lot of folks in CCs are inexperienced, they get damaged and broken. But those things are perfect for cutting a nice trail as long as the soil isn't rocky. Once you get a feel for it, you can almost move at a slow walking pace cutting a nice trail

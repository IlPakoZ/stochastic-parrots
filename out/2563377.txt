Ill participate in your datamining thread. Most of this was for hiking or family. Except Florida, going there was a mistake.

What was your favorite east coast hiking state? I’ve always wanted to check out Maine. New Hampshire was my favorite with Virginia/West Virginia tied for second. 
>>2563386
I’m actually going to Oregon for the first time ever this year but it’s for a wedding so I don’t think I’ll be able to do any backpacking unfortunately. Hoping I can still do some day hikes though.
--- 2563399
>>2563391
Vermont because its way more isolated than most people think. The hiking culture there is top notch, the weather is brutal and also enchanting, and the lack of actual overlooks and views keeps a lot of normies away as long as you are not on the AT. Western Maine is a close second but I hate coastal Maine and the County.

Where’d you go? Arizona and Washington have some of my favorite National Forests. Utah is also amazing IMO as long as you avoid the crowds but Zion NP has unfortunately been ruined by the throngs of retards carving their names on the arches and throwing their trash on the trails.
--- 2563414
>>2563413
Zion wasn't even that cool... Also people never tell you to go to Utah during spring (you should if you enjoy the color green) 

Spring advice goes for any high desert states too...
--- 2563416
>>2563414
I will say that when I went backpacking in Arizona it was in spring and the weather was immaculate plus the crowds were pretty small. I generally prefer National Forests to Parks because they’re free, no camping permit required, little to no “developed” campsites which keeps the obnoxious car campers away and they’re usually bigger than National Parks.

>>2563413
I went from Vegas to the Grand Canyon with a stop at Hoover Dam. California was the Pacific Ocean and a hike to the Hollywood Sign. The only redeemable part was the coast. The rest of the west is very blah to me. Utah looks interesting but I can see canyons and natural arches in the Red without flying all the way across the country.

Arizona only. Not from the USA either. Think the only other state I want to visit is Utah honestly, to see Zion
--- 2563754
Not american but I need to see the North West, seen enough desert shit but that is where work takes me

That's fine, and the mountains might not do much for you if you're from a mountainous area yourself. I recommend Washington state, though. Specifically the olympic peninsula

In terms of cost of living?

>>2564576
Did you fly into Canada to go to... Alaska?
--- 2564597
>>2564576
It’s definitely on my bucket list but I live on the east coast so just getting there is pretty expensive and time consuming
--- 2564612
>>2564576
Been invited for the last 6 or so years. 
The logistics of getting a trailer full of snowmobiles there is the challenge.

That's probably the Tri-Cities, but that's mostly because it sucks ass and not many are willing to live there.
--- 2564617
>>2563518
That's convenient because the rest of the country wants your fat, dumb ass to stay there too.
--- 2564649
Texas soon
--- 2564717
Would like to go to upstate NY, and then back to Washington, Tennessee, and North Carolina. I don't think I'm really antsy to visit any more states besides Idaho, Montana, and Vermont during the fall.

You're welcome to come as long as you don't go during late-September thru October because we're unironically full then. Stay the fuck out then, k?

Only counting states where I've left the airport, layovers definitely don't count.
I travel for work, previously to places mostly in major cities, but now more to flyover country.
--- 2565028
>>2563377 (OP)
Technically I've been to every state except Alaska and Hawaii. These are the ones that I have memories of that don't involve bus/train layovers or driving through. 
Minnesota and Wisconsin are next. Lake Superior is the only Great Lake that I haven't visited and that will be changing soon.

Canadian roadtripper. I'd say the southwest is the best >>2563416 When to CO/UT/AK in may/june last year and it was better than sept/oct just for the green and wildlife. Skipped Zion this time since half the park was closed and had a reservation list. Pleasant surprises at Great Bassin and Dinosaur NP. I confirm that National forest/grassland in these states are as much fun if you're prepared. Some nice spots in SC/NC as well.

black hills and glass mountains in oklahoma are a fun ride, just my personal experience. only midwest state worth a stop.

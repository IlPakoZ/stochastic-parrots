basically the finnish lyrics say that it is alright to feel like you belong to the the woods even if people think you are weird, also never give a fuck and just bear with it if you are made fun of because it is the right thing to do

Due to my Hyperborean blood, I often engage in the ancient rituals of my ancestors. I will always dance in a forest at night playing the music that I have linked below. I can feel the life force coursing through my veins. I gaze beyond the forest as the Faustian spirit lifts me and allows me to look beyond the horizon into infinity. I hear the sweet voice of Mother Nature herself encouraging me to return to my home once more. She whispers through the wind, encouraging me to abandon modernity and return to my roots. Like the trees, that my ancestors would knock on centuries ago for good luck, I too will ground myself to this Earth and preserve the last corners of goodness left in this world against the Judaic forces that seek to destroy it.

Stand strong, Faustian man! This fight is not over yet. The battle for civilisation has only just begun! The enemies of the West are already through the gates! Will you defend Europa and her people? Do not allow the fate of Atlantis to transpire for a second timeâ€¦

My dad used to have horses when I was little. Jem, a retired prize racehorse and her son Halcyon who was jet black and beautiful, and aggressive as fuck. I remember riding Jem around the house when I was maybe 2 or 3, and also worrying about Halcyon who was always left alone up in the paddock behind barbed wire. In another couple years when I was old enough to love them my dad sold them out from under me. Their paddock and all the trails through the hundreds of acres behind were where I grew up and even as an adult I wish I could have ridden Halcyon out through the woods and over the fields and let him come good.

I guess this concludes my sad as fuck blogpost.

Hiked the Sierras with Dvorak and Holst high on mushrooms and tapped into the ancient Aryan blood memories of the lost Atlantic Race.

How much of the space do you want to shade and what are you shading?

If you just want a space to sit and enjoy your garden then an umbrella is going to be the easiest option. 
If you need to cover a larger outdoor living space then sun shades or shade cloth would be the simplest and cheapest, just need posts or trees to attach it to. Ugly though, building a gazebo or pergola would fulfill the same purpose and look much nicer especially if you get some grapevines or whatever growing over it.

If you're looking to protect a vegetable garden from the heat then either build a shade house or hang some shade cloth over the garden depending on how much of the garden you need to protect. Shade cloth comes in varying densities depending on how much UV protection you need. Bear in mind that you'll need to maintain ventilation - a dark, high density shadecloth that hangs down over the sides of the garden is going to increase heat rather than reduce it. 
You could possibly also build some trellises or a pergola over the garden beds. More work obviously but if you do it right you'd provide enough shade to cool the garden beds but not so much shade that they'll be unable to grow, as well a providing additional growing with whatever vines you have over the trellises.
--- 2562640
>>2562570
What's the best way to hang shade cloth keeping in mind that high winds are common so it will either have to be very strong or easily taken down?
--- 2562642
>>2562570
Oh also I'd like to be able to shade all of that 200 square feet. It's for a garden. Potatoes, onions, various cucurbits, rutabaga, artichoke, and a couple other random things.

When I went to the garden centre last weekend, the gardeners told me that you can grow dwarf fruit trees in ordinary patio pots. The trees will remain small and not grow their full height, but you will still get some fruits from the trees. So a bought a few and potted them out in 40L pots. But today I got curious and googled potted fruit trees and some websites say that you need to constantly expand the size of the pots every year so that they can grow, which is defeating the point of wanting the trees and pots to be compact.

Can I just keep these trees in the 40L pots and keep the trees small by pruning them or something? All the trees I got were the dwarf type.

>What's the best way to hang shade cloth keeping in mind that high winds are common so it will either have to be very strong or easily taken down?
Honestly, I'm not sure. For a 200 ft area I assume you'd need to look at what commercial operations are doing and googling various combinations of agricultural sun shade / livestock shade sail / etc doesn't show much that looks easy to take down during harsh weather.

From what I've read it's anywhere between 4-12 plants all the way up to 50 plants per person. I average 1.5-3 pounds of dried beans per 25ft row at 3" spacing. And of course the yields vary on the varieties grown.

I plant as much as much as I can. The only thing stopping me is 
>land available
>seed available
>how much can I possibly plant, grow and harvest by myself (if it stores easily then plant more, if it's something that needs to be consumed fast before it goes bad then plant less)
Beans store well, so there is no upper limit to amount of beans I could grow.
If I have to stuff all the rooms in my house with beans and use them as a seat I'd be euphoric.
If I have to open an door and beans come flooding out of it like water, I'd be ecstatic.
God I think of a giant granary filled with some seeds I grown and harvested myself and I feel genuine excitement rivaling flying your own plane that you built.

Newfag here. Set up some plastic garden fencing yesterday and it looks like shit. Can't get it to look nice, it's just all floppy and fucked.

Can brief exposure to the cold harm tomato seedlings? I need to carry my tomato seedling trays to my greenhouse in the morning and back inside in the evening. This time of the year the temperature outside is usually above the freezing point. Each trip the seedlings would spend about 30 seconds outside. At some point i will start heating the greenhouse during the night but that won't be for a while yet.
--- 2564024
>>2564019
30 seconds isn't going to harm them unless it's really fucking cold out
--- 2564027
always wanted to give growing some stuff a go, but no garden.
Grocery store is having a gardening sale going and they sell a 1m flowerbox (which seem to be pretty rare) for 3€. Its 100 x 17 x 14.

It has 2cm standoffs on the bottom and I was thinking about buying the saucer for it too, drill some holes in it, cut it to size and put it on the standoffs for a watertank? 
It seems like to be foolproof with watering that way.
Would that be enough space for the roots and water down there? Would 12cm of soil be enough?
I was planning to put some strawberries, small tomatoes and herbs in it.
Would there be any benefit to having 2 x 50cm boxes instead of a 1m one?
--- 2564029
>>2564027
should maybe convert. 
Flowerbox is about 40 x 6,5 x 5,5 inch
--- 2564042
>>2564027
I have a single strawberry growing in about 16cm deep soil, in a pot that's 22cm diameter at the top (standard 10in pot here in Burgerland). It was planted from seed and has lived long enough to start producing berries since about a month ago.
The box you're looking at might be a tiny bit shallow, but strawberries and herbs will probably do fine in it. I don't know enough about small tomato plants to say about that one though. I would give it plenty of small holes all over the bottom to minimize water standing in it.
If you're going to move them around, you might want the two smaller boxes instead of one big heavy awkwardly shaped one.
--- 2564065
>>2564042
that makes sense and haven't even thought about it. Will go for the 50cm ones then.
They are running sale on soil, small plants too (i think its called cuttings?). 6x strawberries for 5€, cocktail tomatoe for 1€ and might try peppers too.
No idea how quality they will be, but i'd pay like 20€ for everything.
And if this goes well next year I'll go with seeds.

>>2564027
think i should try to explain myself better on the watertank idea. Thinking about something like the pic, but diy with cutting a piece of plastic to fit into the box. Drill holes into the false bottom and glue a plastic bottle in as a funnel for water.

Or is it trash and I shouldn't bother and just use the saucer for it normally?
--- 2564076
>>2564065
Yeah thats how self watering containers work
--- 2564101
>>2564065
For the part that protrudes down into the water, you could maybe use a little yogurt cup or something like that. I wonder if hot glue would survive the elements? With or without, it would stay in place long enough to fill the whole thing with dirt anyway.
I like your DIY style, that's how I've been doing a lot of things in my apartment gardening too. Got to put all those ricotta cheese and sour cream containers I've hoarded to use somehow.
--- 2564123
>>2564101
it's a pretty funny story actually! Yesterday I bought strawberries on sale and they were terrible (like always).
Was determined to try myself now. Went on amazon put in strawberries, tomatoes, fertilizer and a flowerbox with watertank in the cart. Ended up being 60€, but decided to hold on it, because I'll have to check the store for soil anyways and I thought they might have plants too.
Thursday they always change up their deals and as is if it's destiny its a whole gardening week.
The only thing they don't sell is a box with a water tank, but that motivated me to DIY it!
I'll get back there tomorrow with something to carry all that stuff and see if I can post some pics in here.
I'll have to see if I can borrow a hot glue gun from a neighbour. Otherwise I thought ducktape might do.
>Got to put all those ricotta cheese and sour cream containers I've hoarded to use somehow
I stop at glasjars, but well.. I can never have enough.
I always have some empty cans or bottles, because we pay a deposit and get it back when we bring them back to the store.
First I thought this tall and thin can (like redbull) would do perfectly, but aluminium should be avoided im sure.

i'm thinking on and off about cannabis growing, but I'm also not a fan of me smoking. A friend has a decent sized indoor tent and he got 150-200g out of it the first time.
I'd probably sell half of it to get back power and money from the tent, but i really don't want to be around 80g of weed. I'm the worst breed of stoner whenever I'm alone and around weed. I'd straight up throw a month away 24/7 stoned.
Also I don't want a tent with a vent in my apartment.

not him but in college i had a few 5 gallon pots full of poppies on my balcony. maybe like 3 pots, maybe 4 or 5 plants per pot. 
lanced and i got a little tiny crumb of opium. smoked it with some friends and really only got a few solid hits off. but it was a neat experience and a headrush that i hadn't felt before. it has a pleasant floral scent.
however, i did blend up the pods, boil them in water, and drank the tea. and that was a good dozen or so doses. very unpleasant, poppy tea is not trivial to choke back.
i think the metric was something like, each pod has about 10mg of morphine, which is like a single morphine pill. that's not very much, they normally start people out on like 15mg morphine tablets. 
even if you had a properly large bed of them, you don't get all that much of a harvest. you'd need acres to have anything more than just "fuck around" amounts.
id say, it's fine to grow them. i wouldn't grow a huge bed of them. grow wildflowers and maybe have some poppies mixed in. no one has an entire bed of poppies, and it might give you some negative attention.
i don't know if lancing is really worth it on such a small scale, when you could just process the whole pod down to tea. you'd really need a ton of plants to have an actual ball of opium.

Mother keeps putting humidity domes on already sprouted seedlings saying the moisture helps them grow.
My understanding is that humidity domes are for germination and specialised plants that prefer humid conditions, and that most plants risk mold issues if you keep them under a humidity dome.

I'm not aware that any such thing exists, the flowers have both parts necessary for pollination (which btw you'll have to do yourself). Is that what the label said they are?

We had an orange and a grapefruit an maybe 3-5 gallon pots for about 15 years. These were seedlings so not dwarf but they stayed relatively small (~4' for the orange and ~8' for the grapefruit) and they bloomed a few times but never ripened fruit. Eventually we left them outside during a surprise frost and they died.

Aloe plants could be fun to try. There's a lot of different varieties from ones that grow on the ground to ones as tall as trees and they have a variety of colors. Some cultivars such as Aloe Vera have been grown for their juice which is said to help with sunburns. Also they're arid plants that like sandy soil so you don't have to worry about watering them as much

New beds going down, lads. If you've never made one, it's super easy. Every level is just 3 planks of wood, one cut in half for the ends. 4x4 in the corners for support.

It gets worse. Those roots? Thats' Elderweed. It grows as a thick carpet across the entire area and it's all connected. If even a little bit of the root stays behind, it regrows into more elderweed. If you cut down elderweed in one place the elderweed in another place will funnel nutrients to the place where you did cut it down and regrow it through the thickest mulch you can imagine, you literally can't block it out from the sun, because it just gathers sun from other places and sends it there.
It regrows and out competes things because of that. It starts growing earliest spring with the any other earliest plant you can think of.

The picture shows 1 shovel depth layer taken and flipped over, and some of the top dirt raked off. This thick carpet covers everything in my garden.
--- 2565902
>>2565895
Just teach yourself biochemistry and discover novel compound in the elderweed that can cure cancer or some shit. Boom, a curse into a blessing. In all seriousness, I’m so fucking sorry for your plight. I pray God delivers you the strength to extinguish the scourge.

I just read up on it, apparently it was popular with the Romans as a food plant for its tender fresh spring leaves and popular with the monks later on for medicinal and sedative properties.

Land is where plants belong, potting is only for people who have no access to land to plant.
Pots in plants depends on the human to take care of them to the full extent. Plants in the land, can do their own thing and survive far more without human intervention.
>raised beds
good for plants that need good drainage, inversely kinda poor for plants that need more moisture as the soil dies off quicker and the roots dont go as deep into the ground where the moisture is.

need to be started early, like right now from seeds and then transplated later when it's warm

Anecdata: I planted 40 seeds total, in two batches of 20 several weeks apart. 3 sprouted in the first group and all grew healthy, but succumbed to a spider mite infestation that I could never get under control. 2 sprouted in the second group, but one must have had some kind of weird mutation because it never grew more than a quarter inch tall sprout. The remaining plant (which has never been put outside) is the only survivor of the experiment.

I live in a tropical country now but I really want to grow the vegetables I used to enjoy back home.
Any guides/books out there on how to grow temperate crops like carrots, cabbages, beets, radishes, celery, potatoes, etc despite the heat of the tropical sun? I don't want to be limited to be able to grow them only during the winter months. I'm living only a few meters above sea level, and near the coast so the average temp is around 27°C.
I have already accepted that I may never be able to grow my favorite parsnips and leeks here, or blackberries and strawberries, but in exchange for that I will be able to enjoy tomatoes, cucumbers and melons the entire year.
I was thinking of designing raised beds that use evaporative cooling to create a microclimate to suit the temperate root crops like potatoes and carrots. Has anyone done something similar to this before?

That's how they're actually stored in your phone/camera, and there's a line of metadata that tells your image viewer how to rotate them.

What is the temp during the day where you live? I sowed seeds when the days were peaking around high 50s low 60s (12-18 C) and they even endured a snap freeze, but took almost a month to start sprouting. I wasn’t even all that religious about watering them, because they got a blanket of light snow and a few rains. I actually sowed most of them with about a quarter inch (~6mm) of soil covering them, got some nice rosettes but I moved and had to leave them before they required any management.

It’s legitimately easier to grow them yourself than to try and hunt for them in the wild.

>Tomato, Eggplant, and Chili: These plants are all in the same family (Solanaceae), so they can benefit from being grown together. However, they should not be planted near Brassica family plants (such as Dill), as this can lead to pest and disease problems.
>Dill and Cilantro: These plants are in the same family (Apiaceae) and can benefit from being grown together.
>Melon and Sunflowers: Melons can benefit from the shade provided by sunflowers, and sunflowers can benefit from the nitrogen-fixing properties of the melon's root system.
>Chickpeas and Cilantro/Parsley: These plants can benefit from being grown together, as cilantro and parsley can help to repel pests that can attack chickpeas.
>Mint: Mint is a good companion plant for many plants, as it can help to repel pests and attract beneficial insects. However, it can be invasive and should be planted in a separate container or area to prevent it from taking over the garden.

Teaberry is grown as a ground cover most of the time and it's fruit isn't really suitable for cooking or jam. although you can use it to flavor stuff. It must be like buying grass seed. You dump it all out in an empty area and hope the seeds stratify.
--- 2567063
>>2567061
It also has a piss poor germination rate and seems to die if you attempt to transplant it 100% of the time. If anyone knows the secrets to getting teaberry to survive in a garden, please be a friend and supply that information.

>please be a friend and supply that information
Ordered some small teaberry runners with leaves last year and stuck them in the ground (Small layer of sandy loam backed by almost pure sand). About half of them died, and the rest are still dormant with reddish leaves save one, which I acquired through means outside of germination or ordering. I think the secret is to live in there native habitat, because I've found tons of them on trails not 30 minutes away from me. Did you try amending your soil?

Also, I'm probably going to go through the same hell as you with Pink Lady Slippers, since I'm trying to start ten of them.
--- 2567162
>>2567066
I think a common trait for both plants is that they like broken sunlight and tend to thrive in the semi-shaded understory. Pink Lady Slippers in particular tend to show up on embankments and sandy patches, so to me that suggests they enjoy water running across their roots rather than soaking in. Which is, I believe, classic orchid behavior, just adapted to a temperate environment. It also means they're probably a massive pain in the ass.

Sounds like periwinkle and other ground cover. Hardy as shit in the right environment but covering it with leaves in the fall seems counter intuitive. There are a lot of ground plants out there that do well in poor soil and bad light and I've seen it fail when you don't have those conditions. It's like those cabbage green looking things that only grow in bogs along shaded creeks. They're the only thing that grows there.

Excess of fertilizer can burn the roots.
Compare throwing too much fertilizer to the ground to throwing too much salt to your soup.
The only difference is that you, unlike the plant, can run away from over-salted food.
Google over-fertilization for more on that.
And next time, read dosing instructions for your fertiliser and don't give a seedling a dose suitable for a large potted plant.

I do it after the first two leaves are done forming, and I will usually harden the seedlings over the course of their growth before transplanting to get them used to the climate

Cool to see other people interested in growing teaberry too. I would love to have an abundance of it everywhere so I don't only have it when I'm in the woods. I love it. Last year I tried to start it from seed, cold stratified it, had a couple of seedlings come up, but they died. It was in potting soil, so maybe it wasn't acidic enough? This year I just bought starts and they came with leaves looking pretty good. I put them in the wood chips beds under the Rhododendrons. We have a heat wave right now so trying to keep them moist hopefully the heat didn't kill them after transplanting or I didn't under or over water

I have never had so much trouble starting seedlings indoors. I believe I fucked myself the first go this year by starting some sweet potatoes with old potting mix (heard it was bad, but never had a problem before). Harvested like a hundred slips off that tray but fucked the rest of my starts. I started 2x 72-cell trays of tomatoes and 1 of peppers. Wifey and I can for a family of 6 so we grow a lot. Always grew heirlooms, but I'm a really cool guy and tried some of the commercial hybrid varieties of tomatoes (Invincible, Tachi, and another) and peppers this year. They all died and I tried two more sets of 3 trays ($fuckton). The first set got real bad. By the last set, I did everything I could think of. I sterilized everything including the surfaces. Was super precise with bottom watering. Fancy new air-pruned cell inserts. Growing medium was Pro-Mix bx with some pelleted sloow release fertilizer mixed in. Even misted with chamomile tea. Left the heat mats on all the time until seeds sprouted. What more can I do? Is it possible my (half-finished, well-ventilated) basement where I start my seeds is just a cess pool of fungus and I keep infecting my shit? Can I add some sort of amendment to the starting medium to stop the funguses? Help please. Pic attached is last set when I decided to throw in the towel.

Low cost? Chicken manure or organic granural fertilizer are the cheapest. Not too sure if you need something specific at the later stages when the plant starts fruiting or if it's somewhat negligible.
--- 2568012
>>2568011
Granular* these are slow-releasing pallets by the way, but they're easy to store, don't expire fast, and you can turn them into liquid by pouring it with water for 24 hours.

If you are in a part of the world where they raise cows/sheep/chickens then ask your local farmer if you can help clean up some of the older manure in his fields/farm to help your garden and most farmers will let you for free or if you give them a portion of your gathered manure they will let you keep the rest. If you are in the US ask that farmer what his favorite beer or whiskey is and buy him a 6 pack or a handle of it and you will have made a friend for life.

this might be a stupid question anon but I have never used compressed soil blocks for starting plants. What are the advantages and how do they not fall apart once they are watered?
--- 2568063
Good day on the allotment. The soil from last year in the left and right beds is still looking good and we've planted strawberries in the middle one. Probably going to be growing strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, beans, and rhubarb this year.
--- 2568068
>>2568059
The only disadvantage is that you have to be careful when hardening them off. I'm not kidding there is almost not disadvantage to them. Obviously it takes a bit longer to make the mix etc but really not much longer to fill a 72 cell tray properly. They can't get rained on. We don't have any covered area where they can be left outside 24 hours a day. We have them on a kitchen rack and when its going to rain we bring them all in. When watering you don't overhead water. you can use 1020 trays or basic plastic lunch trays and you water the side of the tray until they soak up all the water.

one more thing as to how they don't fall apart when you water. This is our tomatoes from last year. Once they start to get two sets of true leaves the block is pretty much held together by the roots. When you transplant its pretty much a huge mass of roots and they just explode when they go into the ground/.

There are studies that say you can make a dilluted tea extract, which actually works for it to be absorbed. Plain crushed eggshells hardly do anything. And even then, chalk which contains calcium and magnesium are cheap as well. Calcium also tends to bind with nitrogen, so never fertilize and add calcium at the same time.

dump it out, mix in wood chips / hay to aerate. Smell should dissipate quickly in the sun.
Drill holes in container to add air flow. Anaerobic environment makes for stink, and poor compost.

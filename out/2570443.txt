Why do people make videos of them larping as homeless people for the night? Even worse, why do people watch it?
--- 2570456
Noped away from that channel long ago, it has a creepy vibe. jewtube is always promoting it so it makes sense that it's likely some pedo shit.
--- 2570465
>>2570445
Because those LARPers are making a fortune with these videos while you sit at home crying like a pathetic little bitch.

Just reading the title, it's supposed to be a proof of concept of a survival strategy. It's such a niche thing that will never be needed for 100% of the people watching and the person making the video.
>>2570456
Quick physiognomy check of the guy is a dead giveaway that he's engaged in evil.

I ve had to sleep in a snow cave over night but I had a massive parka style coat and a heavy sleeping bag too. It would suck without gear but its better than freezing to death out in the open. Windchill is no joke, a snow cave can save your life.

YouTuber dont make a fortune anymore unless they are one of the whales. Average YouTuber makes just $30k/year working full time and usually have to live in one of the houses they provide with 8+ other YouTubers

being extremely unlucky. I didnt make it back to my vehicle in time as shitty weather set in on what was supposed to be a fairly easy little hike.

If I saw 12 feet of snow in Mississippi, I think I have bigger things to worry about than if I'm going to sleep in it or not.

If it's thick enough to trap you, it won't cave in. If it's thin enough to cave in, it won't trap you. This doesn't apply while snow is melting or it's raining or something like that.

I've slept in many snow cave and structures. Packed snow will hold its shape down to a few inches thick.

he's a lawyer, soo that's probably where you get the evil creepy vibes.
i found him years ago through his fishing channel. pretty cool dude.
--- 2570704
>>2570668
He quit being a lawyer. He's full time camping, he also has that fishing channel. He's trying to "invent" new camping gear. And he has all that licensed branded fishing gear.
Creepy vibes might be from the late stage Mormonism.
Also the lawyering.
I think prepping is part of their religion, like, he has a duty to be prepared to go to the woods with his family for some reason. I haven't known a Mormon that wasn't a prepper.

It is, part of their doctrine states they need to stockpile food and supplies to help people or protect themselves during disasters.

You can melt snow to make it harder and prevent it collapsing

WTF is going on here
I just watched this yesterday
>>2570456
He's a walking gear commercial is why
--- 2570878
>>2570704
whats late stage mormonism?
--- 2570884
>>2570878
The prepping is early onset Mormonism. It's the foundation for their trad wife mythology... they teach it to little girls in grade school.
There is some kids group named for bees (which are big in Mormon symbiology) that does the youth training... I think it might even be girls only because the boys go into clergy very early.
>t. HaS a bunch of mormon friends, some from childhood
--- 2571449
He has a really good fishing channel too. I forgot the name but I'm sure he's got the links to it on the channel in the image.

thanks for telling us about our own God, person who isn't a Christian, I'll be sure to file it in "advice from a person who would fail the physiognomy check"

he's a lawyer and mormon priest or whatever

we used to make snow iglos all the time when i was little 
sometimes some kid got himself buried under one and died and news talked about it for a few days but that was just life
it was basically a tree house we could build anywhere we wanted and it was awesome

How do you add enough ventilation to not suffocate in your sleep? Especially while burning some kind of survival candle?

He's a white Christian man with a white wife and white children enjoying wholesome outdoor activities with the senpai and teaching people about survival and self-sustainability. He's the epitome of everything they hate.

Just watched a few of his videos. I didn't see any pedo shit, I saw a guy who has friends, family, kids and the money to do what he wants. I have none of these. god I actually started crying a little bit

The Viet Cong built their tunnels wider at the bottom then at the top, like a cathredal arch, which allowed them to survive under the weight of rolling tanks and 20 years of bombing. Some of the Vietnam tunnels were so deep and extensive that they were basically underground village societies.

>>2573790
They will tell you to ostracize your own family if they try to leave the Mormon cult, and they have gotten in trouble with the law for practicing polygamy with kidnapped child brides, like Joseph Smith did, which is why they got kicked out of every single town til they ended up in the middle of nowhere with no one around them.
--- 2573819

I wonder what sex would be like in those tunnels

Cold air sump.
You want to sleep higher than the lowest point in your shelter for several reasons: 
1) To ensure that the cold air sinks away from you, and
2) To make sure carbon dioxide and monoxide sinks away from you. CO2 is denser than most atmospheric gases so it sinks like cold air. It helps if you have some airflow (wind) flowing through the sump to carry away the cold/oxygen-poor air.

I woke up this morning to the gentle sound of rain, it was before sun rise and still dark. I made some coffee. Then I went outdoors and waited for the sun to slowly come out. As it did I noticed a frog hopping around in the puddles on the brick. He did this for quiet some time until he decided to crawl into a crevice in the bricks. I went and got my phone to type this but when he came out he was gone.

I couldnâ€™t believe he had gone in such a short time. I went over and poked the crevice with a leaf and then I saw movement. I returned to my seat and continued drinking coffee. And eventually his head peaked out a bit and then I took this picture.

And that is why I like the outdoors.

Fucking love the rain. And I love how it scares everyone away so you can have some quiet time to enjoy little moments like yours.

I think that might be a toad anon. He likes the rain but not too much

Frogs hop, toads.. lumber. Toads also have warty skin and look dry-ish .. frogs are sleek and usually look wet or slimy. Frogs have stronger back legs because toads basically don't hop--especially compared to frogs.

Something that surprises me but I don't mind at all is how most people absolutely hate rain

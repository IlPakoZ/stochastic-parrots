i've never heard a solid justification for banning corner crossing.
i mean the main reason seems to be to allow ranchers to control as much public land as possible, while minimizing the amount they have to own themselves in order to do it.
any other rationale?

It's that you don't actual own property if randos are allowed to enter without permission you mentally ill parasite.

I dont think you understand what corner crossing is. You can literally step from public land to public land WITHOUT stepping on private land...and yet somehow that is trespassing because the property rights supposedly extend into the airspace....and you are supposedly violating that air space even tho you are not touching private land.

Which is essentially contradictory with the stream acess law (in MT) that allows you to travel thru private property via streambeds.

What the fuck? Doesn't the US have right of way? Here in the UK and pretty much every country I've ever been in, you can walk through any private land and only need to leave once the landowner tells you you are tresspassing. If you are just passing through they, they largely can't do shit.

--- 2536627

It's the same in the US. Unless a property is clearly marked as "NO TRESPASSING", then you are legally allowed to be there until someone tells you to leave, which is why so many people in the US have no trespassing signs around their property. Also, despite what people here will tell you, as long as you're not a strung out drug addicted faggot weirdo, people will usually talk to you before they pull out their gun and start firing.

In America, one of the fundamental land owning concepts we have and had for hundreds of years is that you have a lawful right to exclude people from your land. That’s it, there’s no argument or persuasion, it’s a just a hard rule we have. It’s why easements exist.
--- 2536703

but the issue is that corner crossing doesnt infringe on private land. You literally do not step on anyone's private property by corner crossing.

--- 2536734

--- 2536926
I hate the federal goverment as much as the next guy, but they should just make 1.5ft on each side of a corner an easement. So as long as you don't damage the fence you can cross. Or spend some of my fucking money to stall crossovers to connect public land. Would be like 50$ a pop and paying a forest janny to hike out and set it up
--- 2536984
>>2536926
i dunno, these ranchers and their lawyers have names and addresses.
at the end of the day they are stealing from the public, there should be consequences

like maybe find out where they live or work, or shop -- and show up with a posse and just start tickling them. and i don't mean just a little tickle, and the resulting light giggle -- but full on, heavy duty tickling until they wet themselves. a 20 minute long multi-person tickle-fest, until they just cannot handle it anymore

but the entire premise that you are 'violating their airspace' by corner crossing is such obvious bullshit, only a lawyer would put any stock in that explanation.

--- 2537011
Unless they catch you in the middle of corner crossing, once you are in the blm land what can they actually do? They can't say you are trespassing because you are on public land at that moment. If you perfectly execute a corner cross you would only be on their land for a split second. That is not enough time to ask you to leave or point a gun and shoot at you.

Wyoming may have the air of nothing going on backwoods but without the woods retard place to coasties but the truth is it's just a gigantic open air playground for the unimaginably rich now. They make a game out of how to strategically buy land to encircle other land so they in effect own triple or more of actual land. Because no one else can actually get to the """public""" land legally.
--- 2539362
>>2539312
Isn't all that encirclement going on in the plains where grazing is viable? I think all the areas you'd want to actually hike through are easily accessed public land (Yellowstone, wind river range, Bob Marshall, absaroka)...
>no coasties
I would've thought with Yellowstone there and all the ads WY would be swarming with them. And given the low population and native component they'd be flipping blue any day now.

It doesn't make sense I I can build a structure not touching your land but a few inches above it. Land owners own the air space above to whatever height.
This is separate from the absolute stupidity that is this corner crossing case, they stepped over so no big deal. I think there's much more to the case than the article suggested.
--- 2539606
>>2539605

There is not a single private entity in the US that owns any amount of airspace. The federal government owns and regulates airspace. They "allow" you to interact with lower thresholds, like flying a drone or riding one of those propeller packs. But no, you do not own airspace and never will.

Which is the logical next step for thumbing one's nose at the corner trolls if they persist: flying some sort of personal quadcopter, ultralight, or other VTOL craft into the blocked-off public land.

Lol...found the no land poor. It's called an easement poorfag. Like that strip of grass between the road and the sidewalk in front of a house. You can lay down on that and take a nap at a strangers house and they can't really do shit about it because it is an easement. The courts could easily declare an easement at the corners and be done with this shit. The federal congress could declare that anyone that cuts off public land in this way is a 'de facto owner' and force them to pay tax on that including all the years of back taxes. They could do that pretty easily.

--- 2544367
>>2543627
don't easements have a stated purpose though? like in your example, the easement might cover transit, as in you can cross the easement for any reason, but that's not extended to camping out on it.
like for example on my property there's an easement for firebreaks on the adjoining property, legally our neighbors could come onto our property and cut down trees to maintain the 100' firebreak around their dwelling, and vice versa. (luckily that's never been needed.) but that's the extent of the rights on the other side of the property line

the corner crossing idiocy could be handled that way, or simply state that property owners do not own the air space at corners. either way it's contrary to the spirit of public land, and they are absolutely exploiting the system for personal gain, to the detriment of the public at large. 

it's theft and should be treated accordingly.

In the US federal regulators can determine where devices like drones and remote control airplanes can be used regardless of how "high" you fly them. For example if you live two miles from an airport its illegal to fly a drone outdoors regardless of the altitude... like anything else it's only illegal if you get caught.
Same with trees even--if you live a certain distance from an approach vector to an airport they can make you cut your trees down.

The "where does airspace begin" isn't the minimum altitude for private or commercial aircraft but the point above ground where the federal government determines what can and cant fly--which is whatever the feds want it to be.
--- 2544936
>>2544935
Which is why nobody except the federal government owns "airspace". Despite all the seething in this thread.
--- 2544952
I live in Wyoming and most of this is true. The economy is controlled by two groups - ranchers, and oil/coal guys. The government of course caters to them because they have the most money. But it's changing, due to Jackson Hole, a town on the west border. There, millionaires are getting pushed out by billionaires. All of them from coastal states. They throw a lot of money around and usually get their way. Laramie, and half of Cheyenne and Casper agrees with them.

I don't care as long as they don't start fucking with gun laws. In WY, once you turn 18 you can own any long gun and carry it in public, though few do. And at 21, you can own and concealed carry a handgun. No license required, no bullshit needed. As it should be. It's no wonder that we have so little violent crime here. Most common crimes are drunk driving and bar fights. Nobody can make a career out of it when there's a solid 60% chance that you'll be shot dead if you start causing trouble. Even the cops are pretty relaxed here, as long as you're white.

Not necessarily.

Trespassing is an intentional tort. But in the case of trespassing, because the US has its head up its own ass, “intent” just means that you intentionally went into someone’s land, not that you *knowledgably* went on their land. Its a stupid petty legal distinction to get people in trouble.

Not really, since people seem to keep dying of exposure even when they were raised in the elements. You know anyone who works at a local hospital? The amount of people who show up with heat stress despite living there is comical.

In today's liberal society? Nobody gets shot for trespassing anymore. If you did that you would go to prison for life.

I don't support ranchers because they just further the spic-nig cycle with their beef production.

Y'all need to chill out because the bill died in committee already.

Ranchers, being generally productive members of society, cant go missing without someone noticing within 12hr.

America should have a right to roam law. It’s kinda cucked that you can’t walk around in your own country.

This has to be one of the stupidest things to get in an argument, let alone a legal one, that I have seen. This is a 1st grade argument over the rules of Calvinball that somehow got brought into the judicial system.

Oh no the horror!

But anyways, theres plenty of public land for you to larp on. Even on the east coast there are town or county owned """state""" parks everywhere.

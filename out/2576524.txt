Have any of you ever froze fish whole, thawed them out, then cleaned them later? How did it go if so? Seems like one those things everyone says not to do yet hasn't tried it.

I feel like some of the organs will break down when freeze them and taint the meat when you thaw it. Especially high water content organs like the bladder.

I have not tried it, but I suspect the risk of nastiness is fairly big and it's definitely going to be much more of a mess to gut it after thawing than when fresh. Thawed meat is just different, man, stickier and nastier

yeah nah it's no good mate, ruins the meat and really has a good chance of getting ya sick. always gut before freezing

No idea OP, but I've been wanting to try this with the carp in my local lake.

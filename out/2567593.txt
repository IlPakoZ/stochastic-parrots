Is it true that only 5% of /out/ actually goes outdoors?
--- 2567596
>>2567593 (OP)
It appears that way because the quality posters are out most of the time and ignore bait unlike me.
A tiny amount of bitter redditors and soft effeminate faggots create the vast amount of cringe and bait posts.

The amount of gear collecting larpers has increased though since /k/ became shit.

I unironically go fishing, hiking, camping, but 99% of my time is spent in my garden so I mainly post in hgm

I’d say it’s higher but maybe 5%!really know what they’re talking about.
--- 2567656
>>2567593 (OP)
It's a lot closer to 5% than 100%, that is for sure.

yep, that's why this image pisses them off so much, hits the target right on, they don't actually care about actual /out/ activities, it's just a setting for escapist fantasy.

Probably true. I went on a 1.5 mile loop on my way to work this morning, I saw a small snake in the middle of the trail. Very fun.

>What do you expect on a site created for animewatchers
Ironically the animefags on /out/ seem to be the demographic who go outdoors the most
--- 2567707
I have agoraphobia. Unironically.
I will go /out/ one day though.
Gotta fight through this fucking mental illness shit first.
Wish me luck, I fucking hate this shit.
--- 2567711
>>2567707
Just go outside, I had the same issues 3-4 years ago and going outside cured it. There was a period of 2 years where I didn't leave the house unless I was drugged to the point I didn't know where I was. I just started walking every day and now I'm completely over it, with a few rare night terrors that bring the feeling back for a few minutes before I remember how easy it was to overcome.

kek, yeah that pic is from '17 though i go there fairly often, i was out there last month just didn't take pics
--- 2567717
>>2567707
that's far worse in places with people, not outside. you can be alone in a quiet and relaxing place outside. outdoors are actually a cure for mental illness.

These redditors. Are they in the room with you right now?
--- 2567770
>>2567767
Don't worry. No one has been in my room for years.
--- 2567777
I don't know if it's 5% but there sure are a shit ton of people who LARP. It's extremely obvious to those of us with any real experience. 

Literally top active post right now
>What’s your favorite meal to cook after a long hike? For me it’s a good roast or some kind of stew.

I'll tell you in the real world absolutely no one hiking a multi day trek carries a roast, potatoes, carrots, onions, liquid soup broth (and other extremely low calorie density bullshit), and fucking cast iron soup pan for their meals. May as well be hey guys I love camping in the remote wilderness! What kind of pizza and beer do you guys get for delivery once you get your tent setup in the real /out/doors wild?

I remember a brief moment on /out/, the golden age, a fleeting time when the river shitter bait could be dropped in a thread, and a hundred posts could go by without anyone taking it.
--- 2567867
For me it's the thinly veiled /x/ threads. I myself am a believer in spooky shit but fucking hell this is /out/ not /x/. I'm tired of seeing
>WUT IS DA SPOOKIEST PLACE YOU'VE BEEN?????
>HAVE YOU SEEN A SKINWALKER??? :OO
>CREEPIEST ENCOUNTERS WHILE OUT???
It just shits up the board. Sure one or two spooky threads around Halloween or something but we don't constantly need fake creepypastas on /out/

this is the case because you have to be autistic to enjoy anime, and if their autism hobby wasn't outdoors related, they wouldn't be here
--- 2568033
>>2567975
It's also because us anime enjoyers don't have jobs, which gives us infinite free time to do what we want.
--- 2568034
>>2567867
True. The only interesting threads on this board should be replaced with more boot threads
--- 2568038
>>2567867
There's like 5 footwear threads and 6 homeless/runaway threads, and you complain about the one spooky thread that has been up for a month.
--- 2568065
>>2567777
You’re right.

The messed up part is that oftentimes the newfag bullshit is the consensus here. Like someone says something that’s factually correct, I’ll agree, but half a dozen retards will disagree. It’s ok to have a differing opinion, but that’s not what I’m talking about. 
>cooking stew after a long hike
That’s just a current example. There are always weird, retarded, and often tiresome posts popping up. Backpacking food thread? “Bring potatoes.” Navigation along the AT? “Better bring a map and compass.” Map thread? “The USGS uses a standard ratio other than 1:24,000.” Alcohol stove? “Just build a fire.” And on and on.
--- 2568067
>>2567593 (OP)
No. It's even less. Maybe 0.9%.

My god sometimes it feels like these are spambot posts, especially because all the newfag zoomers keep replying to those ones specifically

I rememeber when /out/ had real outdoorsy people who were the majority userbase, now that seems to have changed to "newfag watched a youtuber backpacking video and now wants to run away from home with zero outdoors experience" threads. Worse is these newfags think theyre qualified to give advice because they saw it on some youtuber clickbait video once

When was this magical time? Because I've been coming to /out/ since it got made and there's always been genuine idiots and trolls pretending to be idiots since day 1. Choke slamming wolves, kicking cairns, pooping in geocaches. If a knife thread isn't on page 1 start a new knife thread.

a lot of animewatchers don't even watch anime anymore they just shitpost about it and masturbate to questionable 2d porn

How do you know that the anti-anime posters don't post OC on other threads? You don't.

They're pretty much happy for me to set up a campsite and live there indefinitely. They won't charge any rent and I'll be able to use the electricity/kitchen there for cooking. Offered to let me live in the house, but I'd be living in a lounge room. 

I have a hare brained schemed to buy a big tipi style/glamping canvas tent and basically live there part time. Days on at my folks, whenever I need to get away up there just 30 minute drive. I'd like to have a stove in there too for extra comfy winters, get some nice furniture and basically turn it into a home away from home. The more I think about it the cost of setting it up justifies the benefits it will do me mentally. 

Has anyone ever done anything like this before? Am I retarded? I have some concerns as to how the tent will stand up being out in the elements indefinitely. Also getting electronics in there to get them wet etc. Any advice appreciated.

Depends on some other factors, but where I live it'd be done for in a month or two from humidity and sun.

Not OP, but you can buy thick canvas tents intended for commercial glamping operators that'll last years. The place I go to for pack repairs makes them to order. Apparently if you set them up on a platform for drainage and treat the canvas for mould they're fine. Costs around $5k for a tent, though.

Woods is a Canadian company that makes old school prospector tents. If you treat them with marine canvas treatment they'll last a few years.

Honestly just do Van Life sort of thing. Put a bed and all your stuff into a van or a truck and just use that.
--- 2567700
I haven't seen anyone mention it but an option other than a tent that is easily placed and removable later is a shipping container .If your friend is Ok with it you can spread a load of gravel out over a spot and put a waterproof shipping container on the gravel for less than those Yurts cost. 
 The shipping containers are delivered by the same roll off trucks that they pick up cars with. I would build off a shipping container rather than a canvas tent.

The canvas tent anons have the right idea, live like a miner or trapper used to with some basic modern conveniences. A company up here is still making them, good for reference and price comparison and you've probably got a local equivalent: https://www.airframesalaska.com/WallTents-s/2018.htm
Alternatively, an army tent like the one pictured is plenty livable for the circumstances described.

There have been some very neat dirt houses made digging into hillsides. I know a prospector tent is just objectively better but making a pithouse probably would raise the property value of the site and make you an eceleb since youtube loves these people. I had a canvas tent set up for years as a shed and they get damp/moldy from limited airflow after a while

I could see this being a stopgap solution while OP makes more permanent modifications, even if just piece by piece adding on actual walls and everything.
>>2566570 (OP)
My best advice is to make a thermal mass heater or something similar, cheap to build. Get lots of rocks for lots of thermal mass. Collecting wood just to camp or whatever is fine and easy when you don't do it often but when you're restricted to some plot of land you're gonna burn through your wood, you want to use your wood as efficiently as possible.
>>2568134
Yeah a tent is no long-term solution and OP probably doesn't have a steady supply of animal supplies like people who actually lived in tents long-term did.
I think a temporary tent is fine and you can gradually either build and expand a shed or build onto the tent frame and gradually add more permanent pieces, you just have to do it consistently. Every time you go down there you make some improvement until you eventually have an actually decent shelter.

Also pay your friend something, sweeten the deal with them. Even if it's 100 bucks a month you have to contribute something so you don't owe them something over this. Your situation might be good now but it might also change in the future, however small the amount you'll be seen as actually contributing and your friend will let you do more stuff on their land if they're getting 100 a month for it.

Also expect mouse shit everywhere if you don't set up traps for them and they get into and shit on everything no matter how secure your tent or cabin is, those bucket traps where the mouse goes out then falls into soapy water then drowns are probably what you'd want for a canvas tent and you can make them yourself, when the mouse dies it sinks and doesn't stink as bad after being left for a few days / weeks. It only smells when you disturb the bucket. Going back to a tent filled with rotting mice isn't fun.

At least build a platform for your tent to extend it's life. 

While you are at it, you might as well just build a yurt, and it repays your host by leaving them with an asset when you leave instead of a bad smell and a dead spot.

Buy or build a small cabin. Most of the prefab ones can be had for fairly cheap if its small and plain. I built a 10x12 with a loft on a skid for around $5k with all new high grade materials last summer. The rougher you can handle living, the cheaper you can be to start.

Your biggest concern should be that your friend will eventually get sick of you living on his land mooching off his electricity and kitchen without contributing. Everyone who offers this does so out of the good of their heart, inexperience, and a lack of thinking it through. They will quickly realize it gets old fast.

This. The camp I went to as a teenager had us in these, they fit 6 cots per tent I believe so they were pretty large. Basically picrel but 100% water resistant thick coated yellow canvas and no porch

OP buy the largest cheapest car you can find. Remove all the seats and stuff in the way then put in a nice cushy mattress and pillows and whatnot, then dig a hole as wide and almost as deep as the car then roll it into the hole and fill dirt up leaving about 1 foot of window room for light. Then build a stairway out and up to the ground or use the sunroof, use this as a safe place to sleep every night. It will have music and will be warm in winters and cool in summers from being underground.

Don't listen to this man. He wants you to breathe in random Chinese pesticides. Shipping containers are a terrible option.

>>2566570 (OP)
OP look into any prefabbed wood shed kits. Maybe some local Amish or Mennonites. Would be more durable than a tent and your friend gets an outbuilding once you move away. That or get yourself a cheap RV/Camper.

get a pole-less wall tent and build the frame out of timber
you leave the frame up, and take the tent down
the wall tent im thinking of just ties to the bottom of the frame
it takes less than an hour to put up
i wouldnt leave it up though, it will get shredded by the wind

Brother you are a homeless dude in a tent.

I mean I've been homeless before, I was employed, lived in a shelter.

Not disrespecting you for living in a tent, it's not like you are settling the West Bank.

Not even settling period, just camping, you know there are a ton of caves out there too.

I mean you are literally just a dude living in a tent posting on 4chan not hurting anyone.

You could honestly get along with the native rural Arabs if you are kind and friendly.

I actually own a glaming tent almost exactly like pic relate, don't ask why. 

I can soundly say that these are a very poor option because
A. They cost a fortune compared to either a trailer or a Mongol style blanket tent. There's zero reason to buy a commercial glamp tent simply because the price is a joke. 
B. They're terrible to live in, the longer you're in the same location the more evident the need for things like a floor,cloakroom, hard walls, a chimney etc become.
They don't have integrated power which is a major issue because extention leads in tents are a bad combination. They don't have septic, and a self composting toilet outdoors isn't fun in winter. 

Just buy an old caravan like everyone else, because your living situation isn't stable the portability of the caravan is critical.
--- 2573339
Also from my experience in tibet and the steepes in regards to building perminent tents:

The tent is part of a camp, you need external structures like a water tank, wood shed, oven, power pole etc. Its easy enough to set up a tent at a camp site like you would an RV but it's another thing entirely to off grid in a tent. 

A perminent tent isn't like a camping tent, many of the parts are large and it takes several days to assemble. Yes, several days, it's like building a small house. 

I would recommend using a steel telescoping mid pole, two steel uprights arranged in a triangle, with wooden beams forming a quarter of a pie. This gives your center pole a rigid structure which avoids so many headaches.
Set up the 3 poles on cement pavers and get a bunch more pavers to support a floating floor. The floor will be free standing with the tent draped over it. This allows for piping/power under the floor. 

The walls should be made of a diagonal lattice of heavy PVC pipe, join it all the way around then build a solid pine doorway, cut the PVC, bolt through the doorway into the open ends of the pipes.
Lay 6 wooden poles outside the perimiter to compliment your 2 structural poles which were attatched to the main pole.

Put beams between all 8 poles and the center pole, having a metal pole cap with brackets is strongly recomended.
Now brace up the roof with studs just like you would frame a regular roof. Nails and a nailgun recommended. 

For the tent material there are many options but you're going to have to sew a lot of plastic tarps together propperly, learn to layer and rope regular wool blankets.
Vapor barrier and modern insulation would work but I'm not exactly sure how, you would probably use the tinfoil vapor barrier under the tarp, then the insulation, then the wool.

While this is still expensive, it's more than possible to buy milsurp blankets,fabricate the simple metal parts, plumb your own PVC for a free standing gravity fed tap/sink.
--- 2573347
This is very different to a glamping yurt in many ways, you dont naively expect to set your tent up on lovely soft grass, you give up any windows for propper insulation, there's no internal structures because you're going to be using coat hangers for everything, it takes days to assemble and isn't strictly redeployable- but you only plan of redeploying it at most once a year. 

You will gravel a path up to it, set up an external camp oven/ forge out of straw/clay.

You will be extremely disciplined living in a tent, you will NEVER bring in candles, electric heating elements, any kind of fire box, or any kind of gas cylinder. Not an oxygen cylinder, not a LPG stove, not a trangia, not a jetboil, you will not store any of these things inside, you will not let anyone else bring these things inside. Much like a ship at sea these safety precautions become a way of life. Even legit tent dwellers who fail to abide are routinely fucked up, by long term exposure to carbon monoxide, by asphixiation, by their tent catching fire, being seriously burned inside a collapsed tent. This isn't a banya, you live here, you can't abandon this structure if it is damaged. 

You must also know how to clean a yurt and exterminate vermin in a yurt, including removing bed bugs. Everything must be not only clean but cleanable.

So I just let it chill and water every now and then until they make new growth?
everyone says mulberry is the damn easiest and fastest twig to root and grow
hell its even making young fruits now, but I dont want them to end up rotting like last ones

I just want a bunch of mulberry small trees, is there anyone that can tell me more info on rooting them? I think they're a popular fruit, but not here where I live yet (climate is good for them tho)

this is pic for reference
usually they have half a 5 l plastic bottle as dome above them but I heard woody cuttings dont like humidity constantly
thus far it seems one of the thicker is getting some little mold, so I did this to help
I basically rounded up my branches, cut them in a way that they had a couple nodes, cut the tip of the lower one and pulled anything like a bud so it could grow roots, I also scrubbed the end with a knife until the white pith to ease them same
plop them in the good soil compost, watered once slightly and domed it, havent watered since then as soil seemed to recycle its humidity

my blocks are made from 4 parts sifted peat and 1 part sifted composted cow manure. You use something called a soil blocker. Takes a bit to get used to how wet it needs to be. I like them a bit wetter than most of what is on youtube.
The bigger blocks don't dry out any faster than standard 4 o 6 packs. The smaller ones do but like any gardener you just need to keep an eye on them.

Can anyone give me an emergency ID on this? I'm almost certain it's a mold. I'm in Kansas and it was growing on my indoor gardenia. It's had recurring issues with what I'm almost certain are spider mites which I've been dealing with by spraying it with a mixture of around 2q water, a tablespoon of vinegar, and a few drops of dish soap. I was going to repot it and saw this and immediately took it outside, now I'm concerned that something might be spreading under my nose and I have a tray of seedlings that might be affected if so.

From everything I’ve read transplanting is a no-go, because of their extremely delicate roots. If it works out for you, I’m happy for you. How many plants do you intend to grow? From what I understand, papaver somniferum does best when planted in the early spring and exposed to cold, and can also endure the winter if planted in the fall and allowed to grow into a sizable rosette. Are you going to grow them ornamentally or do you intend to milk them/turn them into tea? They have a tendency to bolt which may result in multiple short pods instead of one or two tall large pods, and they need a ‘drought’ period in order to stimulate the plant to produce as much latex as possible before you harvest them.

During the COVID lockdown in 2020, I planted a bunch of daffodil bulbs in all the treepits on a major street median. The first year they all bloomed, the second year most of them bloomed, but this year it seems like half or more of them are gone.
What could have happened? Squirrels don't come here and dig up bulbs because of all the car traffic, and while pedestrians might have stepped on a few of them, it doesn't account for half of them vanishing.

Pic related; there originally was a flower/bulb on every corner. In the background you can see more blooming; you can also see that most corners are now empty. What happened?

Taking the farmer pill tonight, Anons! I live in an apartment so what I can do is limited but I got a grow kit for some herbs and veggies and I am soaking the soil tablets as I type this. Going to let it soak in the water overnight and will plant the seeds tomorrow morning and leave them in my windowsill.
Any advice for an urban beginner?
--- 2568692
>>2568681
Does your window get plenty of sunlight? I've got a balcony but unfortunately it faces the wrong way, so it only gets sun in the latter part of the day even in summertime. Location could be a big factor if you want to grow anything that wants full sun, or you might have to take the artificial lighting pill.
--- 2568694
>>2568692
Thankfully yes. I usually have to block out the light entirely during the evenings or else the sun is blinding. Works out perfect for my plants though

Your job as a gardener/farmer is to make the environment as comfortable as possible for the plants to grow their produce, not to baby them and fret over every little thing. It's OK to get attached, but plants know how to grow and if, say, you plant some peppers that are growing a little too slow, don't immediately repot in different soil and start adding all kinds of junk to the water but rather ask around and see if they just need a little more sun or a temperature change.

Some rapid-fire tips:
>Watch water. Put your finger in the soil of the pot to the second knuckle and if it's still moist then wait until later. Make sure you're not putting too much water into the soil too.
>Mix soil. Don't just tuck your plants into a pot full of Miracle Gro, go dig up a 5G bucket of good dirt, mulch with spent tea leaves or homemade compost, buy perlite and something like earthworm castings if you can afford it.
>Network. Find other people in your area that are into gardening or farming. People who love plants love to share what they know about plants.
>Study. Learn your hardiness zones, learn about companion crops, learn about local pests and diseases, etc. You want to identify what you can grow in your space and what could kill it there and how to stop or prevent those killers.
Good luck, anon. Remember: everyone starts with a purple thumb; it turns greener with every plant you care for.

You only have to worry about "legging" with plants that don't get as big like spinach and lettuce. Those are very healthy plants.

>Mix soil. Don't just tuck your plants into a pot full of Miracle Gro, go dig up a 5G bucket of good dirt, mulch with spent tea leaves or homemade compost, buy perlite and something like earthworm castings if you can afford it.

This, I don't know a lot of people that bother doing this and it's a shame. Especially if you intend on transplanting outside you should mix some of the soil it will be planted into in your seeding mix with peat moss sand or whatever else it needs. You should also rinse it out with boiling water to kill any unwanted seeds and sterilize it too. For bigger pots I just fill with mix and flood it for a few days then drain and plant. Also try to at least give the seeds filtered water for their first few watering and make sure to use room/outside temperature water so you don't shock them.

>>2568681
Get one of these (a cheapo one from Harbor freight, all of them fancy or not will stop working after about a year or two) and fill it with filtered water if you can and leave it in the same environment as the plants so that you'll never screw up watering them. They like to be watered like rain/mist because it doesn't disturb the soil or flood them until their crowns are destroyed. Don't rely on "reservoirs" to water it for you unless it's a pure hydroponic setup because you want fresh water to keep all the roots and soil in check and prevent mold. Don't water when the sun is beating on them, nature doesn't and the water droplets can burn holes in leaves.
As for your soil tablets...are you talking about the jiffy pellet things? Be careful as you may not have luck with some seeds because I think those are just pure peat. I personally haven't had much luck with them but I plant things that don't really need them or can't transplanted.

As a beginner gardener focus on the basics. Learn about your plants. 
>watering
>feeding
>up-potting

Some actual tips:
Water from the bottom. Put your pot/bucket in a dish/ pan/ whatever with water in it. Come back later and remove from water after soil is moistened. 

Feeding- Just get a balanced NPK fertilizer and follow the directions. Build the habit.

Soil- these other guys are telling you to find food dirt and make a good mix with compost and mulch and perlite. For a beginner, that's overkill and can even be detrimental. Go get some miracle grow potting mix and use that. It's fine. If you're starting in seed starting pots or cells you will need to up-pot after a few weeks. You'll be able to tell if you pop the plant out and see a ton of roots. Most things will be happy in a final home of 5 gal. Just be careful not to up-pot too quickly else you risk root rot with roots too small to keep up with the saturated soil.

> I just want a bunch of mulberry small trees, is there anyone that can tell me more info on rooting them?

I've heard of the method you use (= stick a stick in soil &amp; wait). I tried it for fun twice when I pruned my mulberries.
Some of them managed to grow leafs, even for three months, but none developed roots.

Last year my m. alba that I bought as a 'fruit plant' had fruit for the second time, and again the fruits were super tiny. This sucks :/
My parents didn't believe me that it's that bad, so I sent them pic related - bottom-right are mine, bottom-left are from another nursery tree (pendula) and top ones come from a random wild tree...

So I made some research &amp; propagated mulberry with success
This turned out most useful: >>> https://www.growingmulberry.org/propagation &lt;&lt;&lt;

What I did: in late June, when the first ripe fruits appeared, I located a bunch of mulberries (m. alba) around, taste-tested them, and chose the tastiest ones with sufficiently large fruits. 
Still in LATE JUNE, I did hardwood cutting:
- prepared a 2l plastic bottle: cut top of it and filled half of the bottle with plant soil mixed with sand. I did not drill any hole on the bottom.
- cut about 20 cm long, 1-year old branches (= those that are no longer green, but turned to wood)
- removed all leafs apart from either a small on top or 1/3 of a big leaf on top
- soaked the bottom with rooting hormone,
- stuck the cuttings in the bottle &amp; watered it
I left the bottle closed (even with loosely screwed cap) out of sunshine in a room for about 6 weeks. Then the cutting grew new leafs and I saw roots appear. 
Fast forward, now I got excessive amount of mulberries that, as all mulberries do, annoy me by suddenly popping green &amp; enlarged buds in the early spring and then waiting a month until the day is long enough to suddenly burst with leafs.

I can post some photos of how they look today if you like, but I don't have pics from the process.

>>2569093
Does the city mow those treepits after they're done blooming? If their foliage is removed prematurely they can't replenish depleted energy stores. What kind of soil is that? If drainage is bad then the bulbs might've simply rotted out.

>>2569093
>I was under the impression bulbs would grow larger every year, not die out. Anyone know?
If your growing conditions are right the bulbs will divide after a couple of years. My grandfather used to dig up his tulips every autumn and overwinter them in his cellar, which was necessary in the northern Illinois climate. He'd separate the dividing bulbs when digging them up. They don't last forever but you can get a good eight to ten years out of them, and keep them going indefinitely if they're happy and divide.
--- 2569143
>>2568959
that's correct about flexuosum
If you live in a place that never dips below 15F these peppers will live 30+ years and essentially become pepper trees. You need two for fruiting. Pretty rad pepper people are desperately trying to get those genes into popular pepper types and so far its been a crap shoot 

Also chirapita pepper grow a massive bush outside first and get all that sweet bark and then turn it into a bonchi(bonsai pepper) and have a ton of little snacker fruit for years and years all season

I'm finding info about fertilisers to be extremely confusing
There seems to be a few kinds
The first is those slow release pellets, the second is the organic liquid fertiliser made of fish or seaweed, the third is the synthetic stuff that you mix with water and the fourth is manure
Why are there so many when synthetic fertiliser seems so convenient?
I've read about manure and apparently it's easy to burn your crops with the high nitrogen
--- 2569167
>>2569152
You don't use fresh manure, you need to let it compost first. I'm not an expert by any means but generally speaking I think organic fertilizer is used to improve the soil over a long period of time. Worms and other organisms in the soil break down the organic material which gradually releases nutrients that plants can use all the while also physically improving the structure of the soil which has all kinds of benefits to plant life (think of the soil as an ecosystem). Synthetic fertilizer on the other hand is used as a quick ad hoc solution, and for plants in containers that arent part of the "living soil".

Especially something like snow peas or green beans. You'll need something for them to climb up I just use two stakes with tight strings running across the stakes every 4-6 inches or so.
>leafy greens
Spinach, lettuce, kale, etc. All easy to grow and can be grown in window boxes if you don't have much space.
>Peppers
Minimal effort to care for, extremely hardy, and produce a lot of fruit. Jalapenos are a great starting point. I water mine maybe once every 2 days assuming I get regular rainfall.

I live in north Arkansas and I have an easy time growing squash, zucchini, and cucumbers. I just planted seeds in a raised bed with Walmart top soil and watered them and got a summer of fresh veggies. They all fruited like crazy and only the cucumber was really bothered by animals. They also all three work as living mulch plants by covering the soil with cooling wide leaves. Did wonders for my okra that year.

I'm experimenting with growing lettuce on my south facing window sill because lettuce is so damn expensive where I live.
At first they grew too leggy; clearly they didn't get enough light, so I made a light reflector out of cardboard and now they are growing fine.

My problem is the afternoon sun, it's making the lettuce all droopy and even scorches the tips of the leafs. So I installed a 5v fan to blow cooler air on them and it has worked fine for a couple of weeks but as we move further into summer the sun is only getting stronger and my lettuce has begun drooping again so now I have to babysit them every afternoon with the blinds... and I don't want to have to constantly babysit them. 

Do triple glazed windows magnify the suns heat or something? 

I tried putting shade cloth over the window but it makes it look a crackhead lives here and also I feel it blocked too much of the light when the sun wasn't directly on it.
I'm thinking of buying a clear plastic sheet, sanding one side of it to diffuse the light and putting it between the window panes, yay or nay?

It's a joke. I've never been able to figure out how to get lettuce to not grow three inches, bolt, and then die. I feel the effort isn't worth the results when far more reliable greens exist. I may just be doing it wrong, though.

That's how my mulberries did look in September, once they survived being replanted to pots.
That was harsh for them, for I read that it's not that easy to propagate them, and I put four in one bottle. That's false imho.
Notice that the oldest leaf (or part of leaf) in each is all I left when I put the cuttings in bottles, all else grown later.
--- 2569536
>>2569533

That's how my mulberries look now. Most of them woke and enlarging their buds and getting them green, but they are still waiting for the day to be longer...
--- 2569538
>>2569536
Just like my mulberry tree that I intend to replace.

All the mulberries did look the same two weeks ago, now they stopped. In two weeks they will probably suddenly burst with leafs.
--- 2569540
>>2569538
And that's similar to what I did to the cuttings – sticking them in a closed bottle with loosely fitted cap. Just keep that in shade not to boil your plants. And in warmth for mulberries.
This is lonicera caerulea (honeysuckle) that I want to propagate, and it probably does not need such a hassle.
--- 2569543
>>2569540
And finally, a collage of other plants for reference. Apart from gleditsia that is also waiting for sufficent hours of daylight, most plants are already thriving with at least bursting buds, and at most fully formed leafs &amp; flowers.

Roses are red (the leafs, at least in early spring),
forget-me-nots are blue,
ohfuck aphids on apple and rose,
and some caterpillars on box, too.

It's sometimes nice to have an excuse to go and make photos of the garden…
--- 2569558
>>2569401
>it's funny when you're digging deeper into gardening and you think about all the weeds you pulled and realize that some of them were probably semi-rare herbs.

Most of the weeds in my garden have a lengthy medical use section in a herb compendium I have.
Starting with dandelion, plantago, yarrow, mallow, nettle, greater celandine, chamomile, mint, … – all these are sold in drugstores as well as infest my lawn.

I do know it, and I still fight them ;-)

>>2568301 (OP)
I moved into a new place just recently and need some advice. I have a screened in porch I'm growing vegetables but somehow, something is eating my seedlings whole without even a trace that they'd ever been there within a single day, often the same or next day they sprout. This seems to have happened even to a brand new pot with fresh potting soil moved to a different area of the porch. There's no slime trails or anything, so I don't think it's slugs. Any ideas on what it could be? The only thing I can think of is lizards, but I didn't think the common anoles ate sprouts.
--- 2569569
>>2569563
don't know about anoles. could be mice. what sprouts are they?
--- 2569577
>>2569563
No traces seems quite mysterious.

Do your sprouts disappear during the day or during the night?

Last year my savory seedlings kept disappearing, and only once they've grown bigger I learned, by looking at leftovers, that it were the cutworms that obliterated them. Cutworm is so an accurate name...
--- 2569594
Can anyone tell me what this is? I initially thought it was a weed because of how sudden the growth was but nothing like it is nearby. I've planted various cucurbits here.

>>2569104
No, they don't touch it, which is why I planted stuff there and am trying to arrange official permission to plant more.
The soil varies from pit to pit; some are almost too rocky to dig in, others are practically muddy swamps, and there rest are somewhere in between. I'm not surprised that the bulbs didn't last in the worst of them, but I'm puzzled when some are thriving and some vanished in the same pit.

>>2569118

I giggled like a teenage boy.
It's range appears to be limited to Europe. Is there a NorthEast US equivalent that could be gnawing at my bulbs?

I guess I'll dig up one or two once their leave start to wither and see how the bulbs are doing.

Guys, I think I fucked up. I started 3 full trays of seeds and when it was warm (85 degree days, full sun) I put them outside despite not needing sunlight yet since I literally just put the seeds in. They dried out pretty bad, I didn't water because the plastic covers were dripping, and I foolishly thought that they had enough, but the soil substrate was dry. 

I have them well watered now, and a few seedlings are sprouting (Maybe 2-3 tomato, a bean or two) but the vast majority of the 150 plugs are empty. 

I planted them the weekend of the 8th, it's the 19th now. Should I re-sow seeds in the trays or wait? Usually they are around 68 degrees (I do not have heated trays)

It's a lot of tomato, pepper, brassicas (Kale, collards) and herbs. Barely anything has come up.
--- 2569835
>>2569348

Its nothing to worry about, its a very common mycorhizzal fungus, Leucocoprinus birnbaumii. if anything its beneficial to your soil, i would spread it around (not kidding). It likes hot, wet, dark conditions, and thrives in pots. You might get a yellow mushroom cap at some point pic related

--- 2569863
>>2569833
You may want to start sowing again. This time keep them inside out of the sun and don't let them dry out. Sorry about your seedlings bro. These things happen when starting out. Guess you could keep them around for a while yet to see if any more pop up.
--- 2569864
>>2569863
I'm going to sow directly over the old seeds I guess, if they pop they pop- I have a few seeds left over. Stupid mistakes, I'm not even new at this it's my third year gardening. Should have known better than to leave them out in the sun. 

Oh well, it's not too late. Still realistically 25 days out from last frost (mothers day)
--- 2569883
>>2569861
>pillbugs
Pillbugs eat decaying organic matter (such as half-composted fallen leafs or rotting wood). They pose no threat to living plants.

>Yarrow is a weed?
It slowly replaces grass in your lawn if it is given a chance. Just like dandelions, daisy, clover or cinquefoil: once it rooted well, you won't get rid of it unless you start the lawn anew.
--- 2569887
>>2569883
>Pillbugs eat decaying organic matter (such as half-composted fallen leafs or rotting wood). They pose no threat to living plants.
Did a quick search just to check this out of curiosity. Apparently, in very wet conditions they'll eat tender plants. Live or dead, they only care about the ease of the meal.
--- 2569888
>>2569833
I'd re-sow, sorry bro. My first tray this year didn't sprout as well, don't know why though. It was all chilis, mainly super hots. Had a heat mat and everything but not a single one came up. Never happened before to me.
--- 2569890

Yeah, the only damage they do is to very young seedlings with fleshy stems, after a couple of weeks pillbugs dont do shit, i 'feed' them with prunings and decaying leaves which they prefer over my seedlings. I've also found that smaller garden beds are usually the victims for pillbug damage, they overpopulate in the contained area and go a bit wild

My guy listen, where you want to grow stuff is too hot right now. Period. If you can't drop the temperature then you're gonna struggle to grow most things not to mention fucking lettuce.
Someone already mentioned beans but some types of tomatoes, tomatillos, peppers for example are things that you can grow through the hottest of summers but that's outside, I can't say if they will survive being baked behind a window with low ventilation.
I guarantee you that your lettuce will bolt with that heat so better throw those few leafs on a sandwich before they turn bitter if they aren't already.

Do you like them over plug trays? My plugs are always so soggy, I'm thinking soil blocks will allow better airflow
--- 2569958
>>2569956
We've been doing soil blocks I think for 10 years or so. A few times we did plug trays but for us soil blocks overrule every other method. 
I've noticed several people on youtube that don't like them don't really know how to make the mix correctly and don't use the blocker correctly. Here is a perfect example of how not to make soil blocks. 
https://youtu.be/pDaUKPB9jas?t=257 [Embed]

as for the "having to buy this mix", you don't for a full year, we do about 600-800 plants per year its 1 bale of peat moss and 1 - 2 bags of black kow compost.
--- 2569959
>>2569958
In my seed tray I'm using about half peatmoss, half soil from the garden and a sprinkling of Perlite throughout, just to evenly distribute. I have rigid plastic plug trays I reuse every year but the hard plastic keeps them soaked- if they're not soaked they dry super fast. Thinking plug trays might be good- I only do about 150-200 plants a year
--- 2569961
What's a good trap crop for cats? If I plant a small bed of catnip/catgrass will that keep them occupied so they stop shitting in my beds? I was willing to let them have a pass but they entered into an armistice with the squirrels and now both dig and shit in my beds.
--- 2569962

wouldn't catnip just attract more cats? be thankful for them. they are keeping the mice from eradicating your plants.
--- 2569963
>>2569959
I'll take some pics later, I have some trays that need to be watered. I've noticed for myself that plug trays have always been harder to tell when to water. the top will look super dry but picking up the 6 pack the bottom is still damp.

--- 2570053
>>2569965
So this is how I water them. I usually put my soilblocks on food trays. The food trays let the air circulate between the blocks because of the low sides as well as being easy to pour off any excess water. I usually fill the tray about 1/2 way and then watch as the blocks suck up the water. If there is excess water I just pour it off.

Hey guys, my woman and I want to start gardening, and there's been this giant patch of large weeds in my yard. My grandad would call them horn weeds but I'm not sure what the proper term is. They're tall and bamboo like, get green in the summer, die in winter, regrow from new buds in spring. 
Anyways I started pulling them out and realized they're attached to this huge root system. The roots are so big they look like tree branches. I dug as many of them out as I could, but they go under the corner fence into my neighbors yards. 
I have all the roots I can cut and exposed, what can I do to make sure they don't come back? My grandad would salt the roots of plants he didn't coming back. Do I do that and rebury in a few days? Something else?
--- 2570070

>>2570126
I'm very much a babby-level gardener but I guess I can always try
--- 2570142
>>2570135
What kind of plants, specifically? Generally you clean the break, then bury it in a light potting mix so a few of the leafing nodes are covered. If it's leafing, either clip the bottom leaves or snip the existing leaves in half to reduce the resource demand on the plant. Avoid the plant being wet. If you have rooting hormone, you can always take your shot with that. If you have access to willow, you can always try making your own rooting tea by steeping a snip.

NTA, but I started looking into this because I found a cherry tomato seesling at Walmart and wanted it. Now I bought some seeds of other things, and I'm looking around for how big the planter boxes should be that I'm going to build. You say most things are happy in a 5 gallon bucket, but everywhere says tomatoes need 18-24 inches of depth in an 18 in diameter container, or about a 20 gal pot. Other places say 5 gal containers should be fine. What's the deal? Do I really need a fuck huge pot for my tomatoes? The container really isn't the issue, it's the soil to fill the damn thing. Am I getting to autistic with this?

no issues. Just be careful the first day or so after you make them and a few hours after watering. Once they start to fill with roots which is very quickly they can be handled no problem. Obviously don't play baseball with them.

Many berry bushes are listed as being self-fertile, but you still want the cross-over for optimal fruiting. That noted, if you start planting things, you'll get pollinator insects. Can always co-plant some other flowering plants to bait pollinators if that doesn't work.

--- 2570366
>>2570350
I literally have no idea, all I know is that they work. My blocking mix is just 4 parts peat and 1 part black kow. Once the cotyledons start getting the purple spots I start feeding 1/2 strength GH flora nova grow until they are out of the seedling stage. I do that once per week until they are hardened off outside then start using full strength fish emulsion. It just works for me.
--- 2570368
>>2570357
there was so much wrong with the Hoss tools guy. Didn't use enough water, didn't compress the blocks enough and just sounded like an overall douchebag
--- 2570373
>>2570273
On another hard drive I have a video that an anon shared here one time. The way he did it, the soil was so saturated with water, that the blocks were floppy, almost falling apart on their own, kind of like a soft cake or something
--- 2570392
>>2570373
that was me. If you watch it again I say to make sure you are careful with them during the first few hours. I'll make a vid later showing that they don't just fall apart. 

I'm not using concrete dust in my mix lol, they just stay together for months.

it WAS you, I remember your trays, lol
--- 2570429
>>2570422
Yep, lol. I think I may actually stop using the 1020 trays and just go with more smooth bottom lunch trays. So I think the confusion with a lot of people looking at Soilblocks is not realizing that the compost for compost a cow manure is the binding part of it. So it almost locks the stuff together but in the beginning, you still have to be careful because as you saw my video, you can just smash them with your hands. So usually what I’ll do is make a couple trays of soil blocks, and then that day I will seed all of them and then just let them sit in the grow tent until they sprout. I may have to mist the tops a few times but once they sprout and the roots start going through the soil block, they become very sturdy.

I'm the anon asking about containers for tomatoes above. I'm trying to make containrrs so I can grow on my deck and the concrete half of my backyard (previous owner thought a basketball hoop was necessary in a tiny backyard). How deep do the containers need to be, and how close together can I plant this stuff? I've got tomaties, peppers, onions, lettuce, and I want to get a rasbperry bush. I can find general guidelines in places for things like depth, but widely varying info. Some places say tomatoes need 24" of depth, others only say 12". I also can't really find information on how close together to sow this stuff. Any help would be appreciated, or ecen pointing to where I can learn this stuff myself. The pastebin in the OP waa helpful for some stuff, but basic shit like this I couldn't find.

Also, what's stopping me from hust digging a hole in my yard and planting a seed? Is there any reason not to do that?
--- 2570528
Urgh. I started my peppers and tomatoes on march 5th in a greenhouse; they’re under humidity domes and on heat mats. I’ve gotten exactly 5 seeds to germinate. Getting kind of worried; I used potting soil in 2.5” pots. Should I start over with seedling mix?

--- 2570617

I would soak them for 1/2 a day and throw them in a paper towel inside of a zip lock bag. Will probably get them to pop in a few days. Throw that shit in some soft warm peat and hit it hard wit heat and light. Will be going good in a week.

A thought. If I have a bunch of hummingbird-friendly flowers planted but don't have something screaming red to draw them in, could I fake the color element using something like a cherry tomato plant?
--- 2570649
>>2570646
I know people who use fake flowers, but I've not heard of tomatoes working for this. Try it and let us know?
--- 2570661
>>2570517
What you need for your tomatoes depends on what variety they are. Determinate cherry toms don't need near as much as an indeterminate big beefsteak variety, for example.
If you want to use smaller pots for bigger tomatoes, you'll probably have to prune the tomato to inhibit growth and force it to focus all its nutrients on growing a set amount of fruit.
As for the depth of the tomato, it's because the stem can grow roots. Burying more of the stem means more roots to uptake nutrients but it doesn't have to be buried deep, it can just be buried at an angle, or even horizontally.

--- 2570801

Depends the type of tomato. But 5 gal should be OK. 
If you're in containers make sure you're using determinate varieties of tomatoes for best results. As another anon was saying, not in response to this post, bury the stem for root production. Good luck!

The climate where I live is fucking retarded. Like yesterday it was hotter than where I used to live in the middle east, and now its nice and cool after a hardcore thunderstorm came through.

Probably would need to illuminate the entire room with grow lights, in order to hit all the vines.

For tomatoes, you'll probably have to go nursery again this year, you usually want them to be a couple months old when you transplant them.
Zucchini, squash, most herbs, potatoes, onions, and beans should be alright to start from seed right around now, though.
--- 2570832
Was just rewatching a video. 
For people interested in trying soilblocking, this is a great video but it does not have to be as intensive as this video. You really don't have to add all the amendments but watching this again I might start trying blood meal.

I haven't even cleared the land I need to anyways so I'm under the gun but worst that happens is my tomatoes just don't have it and I try again the following year. Cheers
--- 2570837
>>2570834
You should be okay starting your tomatoes now. They'll be a little small but they grow fast. US 5b here too. Friend of mine transplanted his tomatoes mid june and had a great year. If you plant seeds today, they will be a month old by memorial day and perfect for planting. "A couple months" can be too long for tomatoes indoors. I started mine at the beginning of March and I've had to pot up to 6" pots because they go root bound so quickly. Better a little late rhan early.
--- 2570855
>>2570837
Tomatoes aren't as bad with transplant shock, I've successfully transplanted big ass tomatoes from a 1.5 gallon pot.
They were cuttings from a previous year kept over winter, so they had like 5 months of growth. It's not a huge deal if they get huge because you underestimated how fast they grow, just transplant them to a bigger pot like you did and prune and bury the stem when you transplant them. 
That said, I don't think he should start any beefsteaks right now if he might have to pull the plug in October. Beefsteaks can take like 3 months to set their first fruit and another 3 to ripen it. A slightly early frost would be just in time to fuck it all up right before it ripens. 
Cherries and sauce tomatoes would probably be fine, but nursery would probably produce fruit from late May and all through till cold hits while from seed probably wouldn't start to produce until late July/early August.
--- 2570866
>>2570837

I live in zone 6a and had some serious damping off issues last year (and I'm carefully trying to avoid that again). I literally was planting as late as June, and was able to harvest beans, peas, okra, beets, radishes, spicy peppers, and even some corn, very very late in the season. Obviously I made some mistakes and I could've done better, but I managed to salvage the remaining time left and made a pretty decent comeback.
I planted two weeks ago and things are looking good. As long as they stay good and I work for it, I'm expecting a good year. [spoiler] I just want my tomato seedlings to grow faster, the warm days are few and far between [/spoiler].

>raspberries or currants
1. Harvesting: red/white currants ripen throughput July, black slightly later. Raspberries ripen from August until winter. So, when would you like your fruits?
2. Maintenance: raspberries spread like weeds. Apart from this, you cut them once a year at ground level. Currants yield better when pruned once a year, but can do without.
3. Pest / diseases: currents are usually demolished by aphids. If it's severe (and currants usually gets overwhelmed twice a year by aphids), you need intervene. I've not seen any other serious pest/disease threatening my currants. Raspberries usually are healthy enough to leave them be. (Both raspberries or currants have a number of other pest that damage them, including butterflies larvae that eat the stems from inside out, but none of these are serious concern.)
4. Soil / sun / water: similar requirements. Both like sun. Currants fancy wetter soil than raspberries. Both will succeed almost on any soil.
5. Required space: red/white currant (unpruned) grows up to to 3m in diameter and up to 1.5m tall. Single raspberry uses up to 0.5m diameter and grows 1.5m tall as well, multiple are grown more densely than that.

I'd rather have white currant, red currant and raspberries at the same time ;-)

(Propagating: raspberries copy themselves by shooting new raspberries from roots, currents are easily propagated by layering and cuttings.)
--- 2571218

Yes. But some will say eg “contents: 50% of 20-20-20, water” which means it’s actually 10-10-10.

You have to dilute it anyway and weaker ones (e.g. 3-2-5) may be easier to mix if you need only a small quantity

It will put out flowers again you just need to harvest all the peppers &amp; then give it some phosphorus &amp; potassium after harvesting and it will throw out a new set of flowers.

Hm... I can't tell whether you're trolling or not, so let me reveal this secret to you:

you just pile your lawn clippings and wait.

If you want to speed up the process:
1) surround the pile with walls (of any kind) - digging a pit &amp; throwing all inside works, fancy plastic boxes with no bottom are fancy, classy stone/brick walls are classy
2) keep the pile moist and warm
3) add super-duper bacteria for a bazillion of dollars as seen on tv etc.

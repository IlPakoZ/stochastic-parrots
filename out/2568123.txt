Does anyone know a way to either genetically modify grass so it doesnt grow or is there some better alternative that we can start using in our yards so we dont have to cut grass? Maybe replace all grass with moss? We have been living with the same stupid types of grass for thousands of years and it completely blows my mind that nobody has ever thought to make a better alternative to what is one of the most annoying things in the entire universe.

Gravel or clover

Just turn your yard into dirt if you're so lazy you can't cut the grass every 2-3 weeks.

or even better yet figure out what wildflowers are native to your area and plant that to attract native pollinators.

Do something like picrel. Use plants native to your area.

Clover is good, pretty tough, spreads well, even has some pretty flowers.
--- 2568200
>>2568123 (OP)
plant micro-clover
or
dig water retention pits and turn your yard into a wildflower meadow
your neighbors are going to think you're a slob and you'll still have to mow a pathway because you're going to have a lot of ticks but it's nice to look at if you have a good seasonal mix

Don't go the gravel route. 
Grass, as irritating as it can be, helps cool your yard down. Don't replace it with a materi that stores and reflects heat. 
Use something like zoysia tenufolia or clovers or moss. Sew wild flowers, groundcover fruit vines/vegetables. 
If you have a large area plant some good sized trees and then just kill the grass and mulch everywhere. Over time add some smaller interesting shrubs.

Gravel is shit. It's much higher maintenance than anyone will admit. I have a gravel driveway and gravel accents near the road and that shit is constantly under invasion by mosses and hardy plants like dandelions and even fucking violas. Be prepared to re-gravel every few years.
--- 2569071
>>2568222
Grass is invasive. 
It is loved by retarded parasites who don't know shit about their local biome and who have zero desire to learn even the basics about their native species.
--- 2569073
>>2568217
If you do it right you don't have to actually plant anything except maybe a few native trees. If you focus on killing invasive and non native species you'll always get native volunteers after that you can move them around or keep what you like.
After a few years your yard will look like a garden and be ultra low maintenance,,,
--- 2569086
clover is great.
you can also just let your lawn go wild, just mow the perimiter and maybe a path through so it looks intentional.
--- 2569088
>>2569086
once you get some domestic wildflowers going you can call it a meadow lawn
--- 2569181

that looks like a lot of maintenance for it to look somewhat beautiful, at least it's not as tedious as mowing your lawn

--- 2569195
I wish more people hated grass, because I absolutely hate the sound and smell of lawn mowers and weed whackers and leaf blowers. Every lawn tool I have is electric so I don't make a whole lot of noise, but I'm still planning which areas I want to convert to flower beds and/or native low maintenance areas to reduce mowing further and benefit wildlife.

A easy free way to stop grass growing, is to get old cardboard boxes every restaraunt throws out. Lay them flat on the ground and cover with some deep free woodchips.

Interesting. I use a similar method when I convert grass to planted beds. Mow grass as short as possible, cover with newspaper, then cover with bark mulch.

You really can't. Letting it go wild means shrubs and eventually trees will take over.
The longer you "let it go wild", the more expensive it becomes to fix it again.

>>2569088
Your picture isn't wild growth but deliberately planted and cared for.
--- 2569336
Grass is for boomers, just till the dirt and grow a garden in your yard.
--- 2569343
>>2568123 (OP)
Moss will only work in areas with lots of precipitation. Look for groundcover plants that can grow in your climate zone and plant a nice garden, but please don't replace it with gravel. Gravel is bad for biodevirsity (just as bad as grass), looks terrible and will be a shitload of work once weeds start to grow in there.
--- 2569351
>>2568123 (OP)
Check if you can get slow growing grass. Some people use fast growing football field seeds "because they want to make it look good fast" but forget that it keeps growing and how often they now have to cut it.

takes a whole day because 50 year old lawn mower can only handle 5 minutes at a time and the grass is not long enough for a scythe

Clover or go online and look up "alternatives to grass lawns" there's a bunch of plants you can use with different characteristics that you may have a preference on. Also there is white and red clover you may prefer one over the other. Also you can cover certain places with moss if it doesn't get much traffic. Some plants can handle a lot of traffic, some very little

Seconded in favor of clover coverage, superior to grass, and good for pollinators.
--- 2569398
>>2568163
people really need to stop posting these pictures. That is a highly maintained bit of yard. Gravel looks even worse than over grown grass. You need to clean your yard frequently if you have trees or bushes near enough for the wind to blow stuff in. It'll look like shit after a couple weeks if it's gravel. It'll look like slightly less shit in a couple weeks if it's grass, since the overgrown grass will hide some of the detritus. God help the neighbors of the aspie that thinks they can just spread bunch of gravel and rake it once every couple of months, then start dousing their entire gravel parking lot shit show in weed killers.
--- 2569400
You can always plant aster, goldenrods, milkweeds, joe-pye weed, helianthus, coreopsis, sun flowers, native bunch grasses like big blue stem, prairie dropseed. Turn your yard into a wildlife habitat.

You lose the pleasure of mowing your lawn in the morning :^(

Look up native biomes in your area and plant stuff from that. It'll take care of itself better than many other plants. You don't need to only have a single plant across your yard and it can be simpler than gardening. If you have an HOA you might be out of luck though. I hate grass lawns and HOAs so much it's unreal.

Red thyme. Repels mosquitoes and doesn't get longer than three inches.

Also it is hardy and will grow with little water. Edible too, considering it's thyme.

Lol. Lmao.

Not everyone lives in the desert. 2 weeks will have you mowing slower. 3 weeks would be near impassable

T. Thought I could get away with mowing only every 2 weeks last year.

it is a ground spreader. It will keep spreading until you stop it forcefully. Things will also grow through it and it shouldn't be in full sun else it will turn to shit in mid summer.

Impeccably kept lawns are the sign of a good neighborhood. The HOA has rules for a reason.

Just plant artificial turf. If that's too complicated you can use concrete to turn your yard into a beautiful patio.

Just no. Sheep are the right choice â€“ they cut the grass to a consistent level all over the lawn.
Goats eat all until only dirt remains.
Goats are likely to eat things that you would never expect them to consume.
For instance, if you leave a cotton T-shirt and a goat finds it, it might just eat it.
And goats will attempt to escape, just because they can.

One particularly hot and dry summer I simply refused to continue wasting water on the lawn and just let it bake in the sun and die out. By the winter there were already weeds and different grasses growing there
The following summer was also extremely hot and yet those weeds survived on only the occasional rain and watering only once a week. They also had cute small wild flowers
Crazy how nature do dat

i've done research on this. clover is the best option but even then it's not perfect. it's weak and gets torn up.
grass you can buy which are short, are not that fucking short. 
people hate GMOs and they basically never get approval for things that aren't agriculture. the only one im aware of is monsanto's roundup resistant grass. and it 's just a normal grass, but resistant to roundup.

i hate luddites. we could have grass that uses less water, doesn't grow as high, etc. but gmo bad.

dam if there were just a way to keep your lawn cut with minimal maintenance.... 

like a one time invest of time an money and minimal aftercare.

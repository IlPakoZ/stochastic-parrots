I am looking to do something memorable for an important birthday of mine.
I would like to walk 70km to a very small village in a extraordinarily shit part of south eastern romania as that is the village I spent a considerable amount of my childhood in.
My birthday is in early August.
During early august where I live the temperatures are usually near 40 celcius or more. It is usually bone dry but sometimes there are tropical rains which put even the storms of Havana to shame.
The route to that village has 2km of gravel road of varying intensity. The rest of it is pure dirt road.
The dangers include:packs of rabid dogs,very hungry dogs,migratory wolves;swarms of aggressive wasps;drunk and angry car drivers;and the rare druggie which uses shoe glue to get high.
If I am lucky,it will be dry and the road will be dry dirt.
If I am unlucky,it will rain and the road will be mud.
If I am very unlucky,it would have rained before sunrise,making a humid,hot suffocating atmosphere. The road will be a very thick mud.
What tools and equipment do I need to make such a journey possible?
What tools should I have in order to counter the packs of canines which usually patrol the area?
Could you mention anything related to this subject such as similar experiences?
FYI in Romania,owning a gun as a nonpolitician or police officer is impossible.
The max length acceptable for a fully extended pocket knife legally is from the tip of your longest finger to your wrist which in my case is 17.5cm,but in practice police will give you shit if your knife isn't 6cm long or smaller.
It is a pain to obtain pepper spray and cops will give you shit for that too.
In Romania,if you defend yourself from a murderer,you get 5-10 years and a whole lot more if you kill him while he gets 1-2 years and may get even less if he says he defended himself. Also if you hurt an animal,you are legally obligated to take it to a vet to treat it,otherwise you get a very hefty fine and 1 year in prison.

>What tools and equipment do I need to make such a journey possible?

You're going to need a water filter and you'll want to know the location of water sources along the way. You'll also want some quick to eat high energy food. Some electrolyte packets to add to your water as well.

A daypack should be fine with minimal supplies, because you are going to want to travel light.

>What tools should I have in order to counter the packs of canines which usually patrol the area?

A couple trekking poles should be all you need plus they will help you along the way.

That is going to take you ALL DAY. Like 20 hrs or so. Hope you are in good shape. I would think more like a marathon runner than a hiker.
--- 2540310
>>2540305 (OP)
On a hike like that 70km equates to around 12-14 hours of constant march (you will need brakes so if you do it in less than 16 hours it will be an achievement), that anon is a right out endurance sport. Given you have no idea how to go about it makes it clear you are not ready to try that, your muscles and ligaments and joints are not ready to try that, and definitely your head is not ready to try that. If you really want to attempt that (which is a stupid idea but doable) the first thing you need to do is get some good hiking shoes (for flat ground i would take trail runners over normal hiking boots) and start walking at least every other day. Maybe, if you start training now, you will be in a shape giving you a fighting chance by August. Maybe. If you do what i suggest you will figure out the technicalities by yourself pretty quickly.

Man,the way to there is FLAT. No hills or nothing,flatland.
I do not have any trekking poles as I have never went to a hilly region where they may be useful.
>Some electrolyte packets
I do not know what those are,what they do and I neither know where I can buy them.
>You'll also want some quick to eat high energy food.

>Hope you are in good shape. I would think more like a marathon runner than a hiker.
When I get my groceries I can carry 20-25kg bags for 10km as that is the distance between where I am staying and the shop with semi affordable prices.

Trust me, they are useful even on flat land. Bare minimum would be some sort of hiking staff/stick.

That's not bad. Try going grocery shopping twice in the same day. Do that often.

lol,I have none. I have a pair of chinkshit adidas copy which have carried me for 6 years,all day every day.
If I was to buy a pair of those,what materials would be best so the shoe would be durable and water resistant?
>Given you have no idea how to go about it
I've never done this before as if I go from one point of my city to the other it is 10km,20km if you don't pussy out and take the bus home.

What should I take for the journey? How much should the backpack weigh? Would it be bad if I carried it in one hand so that I can defend myself from attackers?

I haven't eaten any sugar since that new years cake slice. Will probably eat some sugar next month as there is someone's birthday then.
Is there anything other than sugar which fits this role? Does this really have to be carbs? What else which I can easily find at home works? Would going an entire day without eating kill me? 
>That's not bad. Try going grocery shopping twice in the same day. Do that often.
Bro,I walk 20km a day minimum. I sometimes walk 40km long walks just for fun.
--- 2540341
>>2540322 1/2

>Why? I have walked for 6 hours continously before and I never needed a break.
Because that shit doesn't scale, as with most endurance shenanigans think exponential, not linear. Keeping a good pace, let's say 5km/h hour after hour will wear you down, and you will need to keep it if you want to make the hike in relatively good conditions.
>I walk 20km daily
That is respectable
>How? What should I do?
If you are used to walking try doing one longer hike over the weekend, possibly increasing your load gradually, until you are comfortable lugging a reasonable day hike kit
>lol,I have none. I have a pair of chinkshit adidas copy which have carried me for 6 years,all day every day.
I am not joking here, at distances like that good foot support is crucial.
>If I was to buy a pair of those,what materials would be best so the shoe would be durable and water resistant?
IDK about water resistance, i would prioritize breathability over that, there is no way your feet will stay dry in the rain anyway really. As for durability, pretty much anything non meme from any decent brand will be good enough for what you want, i have a pair of relatively cheap trail runners from Asics and i can't really complain about them so far. Vibram soles beat polymer stuff, good padding (gel or otherwise) is welcome too.
>I've never done this before as if I go from one point of my city to the other it is 10km,20km
That's fine, what i meant was more in the aspect of mental preparedness, at some point you just need the attitude to push yourself further, and that comes with experience.
>What should I take for the journey? 
That is a very personal thing, the short and convoluted answer is, whatever works for you.
--- 2540345
>>2540322 2/2
>How much should the backpack weigh? 
Less than you are capable of comfortably carrying for a day, again, depends on your physical fitness. I will add a point here, i often see people throwing out a brand or model as an answer to "what should i get", that's not a great answer, the better one is, visit a decent outdoor shop, have some "load" with you so you can weight down the backpack, and choose what fits your body type well, that's far more important than whatever brand/type/purpose it is.
>Would it be bad if I carried it in one hand so that I can defend myself from attackers?
It would probably be pretty bad, asymmetric load will quickly strain your back and well fitted backpack doesn't really limit your movement enough to not let you defend yourself if you really had to.
--- 2540350
>Is there anything I can do to prevent dying from dehydration

You are going to go through a lot of water on a hot day hiking that far. Like 4-5 liters. Maybe if it's a rainy day you'll have less trouble. But it's going to be tough without a refill. Unless you want to carry all that water.

>I asked about the supplies not the backpack

Just off the top of my head:
A small towel or bandanna
A headlamp (you will be hiking in the dark either at the start or the end or likely both)
Food
Toilet kit (TP, hand sanitizer, small trowel to dig a cat hole. just in case)
Water filter
Maybe a light jacket or something.
Med kit
Power bank to recharge your phone
Maybe a tarp or poncho or a space blanket in case you have to spend the night out there.


>>Trust me, they are useful even on flat land
>why?

They allow you to use some of the muscles in your arms to propel yourself forward so it's not all on your legs.

>What are they used for?

You put them in with your water to avoid hyponatremia: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711


>Does this really have to be carbs?

You'll need the energy. Sugar is a quick burst to get you out of a calorie hole. This isn't a time to think of loosing weight. You need calories to push you forward. Carbs can give you those calories quickly. A handful of gummy bears hits you quick and easy to digest on the move.

>Bro,I walk 20km a day minimum. I sometimes walk 40km long walks just for fun.

Ok great. Keep doing that.

>If you are used to walking try doing one longer hike over the weekend, possibly increasing your load gradually, until you are comfortable lugging a reasonable day hike kit
I see. When I walk on long walks in my city I don't wear a backpack because why would I. Although those 20 daily km I do carry a heavy backpack with notebooks and the like.
What should a hike kit include? 2 liters of water and some food. Would boiled oatmeal work? What container should I use for that? 
>your feet will stay dry in the rain anyway really
That dosen't bother me that much,but what really bothers me is dust resistance. I hate having black feet when walking for a bit in the country side when wearing shoes made of fabric/running shoes.
I can walk comfortably for 20km or longer in my leather shoes.
>whatever works for you
I was talking about supplies
>visit a decent outdoor shop
there is only one outdoor shop in my town and its a meme.
I have looked online for a big backpack and I found one with the capacity of 80l. Very very cheap,made of polyester.
>picture
I have a backpack which I use daily for carrying what I need,I am not sure how big it is,but it is the biggest I have seen at a supermarket,will post a picture of it next reply.
I am 60kgs at 172cm.
>doesn't really limit your movement enough to not let you defend yourself if you really had to.
I can't punch good with a loaded backpack on my back. Throws my balance way off.

>>2540305 (OP)
Furthest distance I've covered was just under 40mi (65km).
You should be able to cover the distance within the day, only tips I have are:
- You'll walk fast at first, after the 20mi mark your legs will start aching and slow down. The final 10mi will be the worst.
- Eat along the way, make sure not to eat anything too filling or you'll be too tired to finish.
- I would bring water and refill along the way if possible. You could get away without a pack; a charger, water and snacks can fit in cargo trousers pockets.
- Bring something to entertain you, the repetitive landscape will bore you early on.
- Don't do any long walks in the week before, after completing this walk your legs will feel dead for 3-4 days, to the point where you will struggle to walk and possibly fall over.
- Wear shorts and non restrictive clothing. I wore rugby shorts and a vest with trainers, something similar could work for you

>You could get away without a pack
would a 80l backpack be overkill?
>Bring something to entertain you
I can listen in my head to the last 50 songs I've heard + some random ones which I haven't heard for 2 years or more. Are my thoughts enough? 
What did you have in mind for "entertainment"? I am walking without nobody else.
>Wear shorts and non restrictive clothing
I worked entire days in the 40 celcius summer with regular jeans and a tucket polo tshirt. Somehow I had no overheating issues,didn't even break a sweat despite shovelling sand,carrying concrete,cutting trees down,etcetera.
Would jeans and a polo shirt suffice?
>>2540357
>Eat along the way, make sure not to eat anything too filling or you'll be too tired to finish
Is it compulsory to eat? What should I eat? In what container should I carry stuff I made home?
>after completing this walk your legs will feel dead
Couldn't I walk back home the day after? I will find somewhere to stay and sleep. There is no public transport there and only 3 cars exist in the whole village. The nearest city is 70km away so neither could a taxi come and get me.

You must be a troll, way to bait.
I'm not talking about heat when I say wear less restrictive clothing, you will feel better if you do - less strain.
For food just ear what you like, nuts are good but heavy.
You would want to weight a day after doing the hike, then you could probably do it on the way back

I don't know if any of the anons here mentioned it yet, but I once walked about 55km in one day. Most of it on straight road. My feet were fine if very sore and my legs were weak for a day or so after. Now what fucked me up was my cock had been dangling in my pants rubbing against the fabric so often that the entire tip of it alongside my foreskin was rubbed raw so bad it was bleeding quite a bit afterwards.

So take my advice, do not go commando or with boxer shorts if you do this.

I can’t help you much with the dangers, since I’m an amerilard and just shoot everything that spooks me. But I’m also a distance runner so I’ll share my thoughts about that side of things. 70km is far, but it’s not -that- far. People can and do regularly train to run longer distances in worse conditions. Since you’re already doing 20km/day you’ve got a good start. If I were you I’d keep up with the 20km per day, then add in longer days once per week, building those up slowly to 50km. Increase the distance slowly, and every third week decrease it slightly (for example 25 km, then 28 km, then 24 km, then 27 km, …). I followed a plan like this to train for ultramarathons, but I’ll also point out that I had aid stations with those and I’m not out in the heat for as long. You should plan on staying very early while it’s still cool. And if you’ve trained enough you’ll have enough experience to figure out how much time, food, and water you’d need. You could look find a bunch of ultramarathon training plans online, then just adapt for your purposes. Notably you care about the distance more than the speed. Perhaps instead of speed training you could carry a bunch of extra weight.

Man,I just never went on a hike this big.
Normally I just go on long walks in my city. I have never needed another pair of socks.
--- 2542343
>>2540305 (OP)
I guess you are serious about doing 70km on the same day.
Your clothes should be:
>Antiblister socks
Blisters sucks even more when they get skinned and start bleeding, get some good socks. A cheaper solution is wearing a thin sock, and then a thicker one. It's gonna be hot, so bring at least another pair so you can change to the fresh ones.
>Sporty shorts
Similar to the antiblister socks. Get some shorts/briefs that won't irritate your groin/legs due friction because you walked a shit-ton. Again, bring another one so you can change to the clean ones.
>Cap/Hat
As you said, Sun is in full-power on August. Protecting your face/neck is important. Choose a boonie hat if you can with a lace for your chin.
>Sporty Trainers, Hiking Boots, trekking shoes
You want something that has good cushion. Your main objective is avoid your knees getting fucked up, also stabilize your walking to avoid spraining your ankles. Use them for a week at least to break in before going for the 70km walk.
>Summer trousers and shirt
Trousers that are lightweight and comfortable, your average jogging pants should do the job. Shirt with good breathability. Get another one for changing after hours sweating.
Cont.
--- 2542345
>>2542343
Also, bring money and your mobile phone, fully charged. Now, on your backpack:
>Water
Knowing that there are no fountains or streams, carry at least 3 liters of fresh water. I dare to say that you should try to bring even more, 5 or 6. Carry it the way you want. Water canteen, camelback...The easiest way is one or two liters plastic bottles. Do not be afraid to bring 5 or 6 liters.
>Food
Apples and oranges (fruits in general), those will help you to hidrate and obtain a small but quick amount of energy. Curated meat, cheese and bread, make sandwiches so you don't have to stop for cooking. If you wanna cook, bring an alcohol/gas stove and canned food (or a small pot for boiling soup/stew); be wary, this is extra weigh. Sweets like gummy bears and peanuts will give you energy, but also make you thirsty. How many? I don't know, I would bring at least food enough for one day.
>Spare clothes
Said before, an extra pair of socks, another shirt or t shirt and another briefs. It's summer, but just in case, put them on a closed plastic bag, the minimum to protect them from possible rains.
>Medkit
Something easy to use. At least bandage and desinfectant(alcohol) for cuts and bleeding. Medical tape for the blisters and the bandages. Some medicines like ibuprofen for possible pains. Learn how to use them.
>Map (and possibly a compass)
I am sure you already know the way, but in case you get lost or slow and night hits on, map will help you find nearest place to get help or take cover. Use your smartphone, but paper map and compass will always work because those don't use batteries. Learn to navigate land.
>Flashlight with spare battery
Anything, ideally some headlamp because it will let you hands free.
>Rain jacket
Just in case. A light one, no need for a winter jacket. If no rain, you can use it for cutting wind or as an improvised blanket.
>Paper towel/wipes
Keep your arse clean.
>Sun-protecting lotion
30º protection is enough unless you are a pale one.

>>2542345
These are optional, but will make your life easier if things go south or you are not capable to make the 70km in the same day:
>Water filtering
This can be a whole world, and also will be useless if there is no water source in the nearby. Water purifier tabs will kill microbes from water. Water filters can do that (sometimes) and also filter impurities like sand or vegetals. The best way to clean water is boiling it first and then filter with active carbon filters, but that's slow and sometimes expensive.
>Blanket/sleeping bag
Sure, summer is fucking hot, but this will make easier to sleep on the ground. Combine it with a sleeping pad/mattress.
>Rain-proof tarp with some ropes and pegs. 
For improvising some cover, use trees or bring poles. Ropes with carabiner are easier to use. Learn to make a tent.
>Insect repelant
Get this one from a Chemist/Drug store (or if you dare, from a pet shop). Mosquitoes, flies and ticks suck a lot.
>Walking cane/Trekking poles
Not a must-have, but will make easier to improvise a tent with the tarp. Trekking poles will make easier to distribute your weight when walking, alleviating the effort made by your legs. Also, a last resort weapon against wild dogs.
>Plastic bags
For organising your stuff and possible protection from the rain (you could also use a raincover for the backpack). Consider using a small one for your rubbish (i.e. food envelopes, used wipes), dropping rubbish when /out is uncivilized. 
>Sewing kit, duck tape and a lighter
This one can be questionable, but weights next to nothing and will help you to patch up any damage you can get in your backpack or clothes.
>Knife/Cutlery
A pocket one, for cutting bandage or ropes. Even scissors. If you are eating from tin can, bring a way to open it and at least a spoon.
>Toiletry
Besides the toilet paper and wipes, small towel,some deodorant or soap and teethbrush with dental paste. Just if you wanna stay higienic after 70km under a hot summer sun.

>>2542346
Some final comments: 
>Backpack
A 30L backpack could fit all the stuff said before. Try to fit everything in the backpack and to go for a small walk to check how it goes: weigh distribution, closing/opening lid and zippers when full, comfort, reliability... If you struggle to keep everything inside, go for a bigger one. Above 50L in my opinion is quite overkill. Technically, you could even go without a backpack and carry only a gallon bottle full of vater, but that's risky and stupid.
>Weight
Try to keep the weight on your backpack below 15 kilograms, 10 kilograms would be better. The idea is to put the least effort on your knees. Do not drop essential stuff like water or medkit for saving weight. Pack light, but pack clever
>Walking breaks
Try to walk around 50-60 minutes and then sit down and relax your legs for 5-10 minutes at least. Maybe you are able to walk 4 hours straigh, but you are walking 70km, and in the case that you are walking at 5km/hour nonstop, it would take you 14 hours, overexersizing your muscles are a risk for injuries. Let your muscle relax so they won't fail you in the middle of the trail. 
>Time
Schedule your departure at least one hour before Sunrise, so you can get a fresh start. You could try to do at night, but not worth it if you are going to have troubles navigating the land in the darkness.
>Keep somebody in touch
Tell somebody, anybody, that you are going to be out of home for at least a day. Tell where you are going and when you are coming back. Do not try to go out without no telling. Stay in touch via mobile phone in case you get lost or injured and can't keep going on.
>Training
Do legs and back exercises, train resistance, do some cardio. Practice walking without weight, try to go for long distances, do not overexert yourself, specially the week before going 70km.

>Question, were those restrictive laws a thing already before you becoming part of EU?
Honestly?
I don't know for sure about the knife part. 
But for owning a gun,you can bet that they were illegal.
My dad told me that one time when he was walking at 8pm,some militiamen(police officers before 1989) stopped him. Theynasked him for his documents and right out of the sudden before even being able to show them one pistol whips him in the back of the head. He falls,they kick him in the head and under the sides of the ribcage(probably going for his liver) until he was unconscious. He wakes up in the middle of the day in the same place they left him to see his wallet,watch,shoes,pants and belt stolen and that he was wet all over.
So probably the laws were just as shit if no shitter then.

Hey anons. I'm also about to do a similar hike, although opposite conditions. I need to travel around 180km, I am pretty broke, and public transportation is not an option. I'm in good shape, although I am not experienced in camping much. It will be around -1 to -10, although there are many stops along the way with population centers. I have running shoes and steel toe boots, a Walmart sleeping bag rated for 10 Celsius (lol), a butane lightweight camping stove, 
A tent (6 person, heavy as fuck, I'm sure that'd kill my spine by the end of it). For backpack options i have 1: a normal backpack from high-school, and a pizza delivery bag that i stole from my pizza delivery job a couple years ago. I can kind of wear the pizza bag as a backpack albeit uncomfortable. I'm going to try to modify it to be comfortable and not spine shattering, maybe add some straps if possible? I'm aware this is stupid, but I have no choice. Any advice is appreciated. I feel I'll be alright temperaturewise for the walk, but I'm not sure about sleep?

I did an 88km hike last summer. Here are my tips, 
>Start early, it's easier psychologically if you're there for sunrise and sunset
>Do a couple of longer walks in the run-up (>30km)
>Pack a lot of food, make yourself eat every 30-60 minutes (closer to 30 toward the end), this'll be tough when you're not hungry but if you don't, you'll bonk
>Good foods: nuts, bananas, Snickers

90% of this is going to be about the condition of your feet and, at some point, you're going to hit a foot pain wall you have to just get through, but: 
>Buy blisterpacks (Compeed is the best I've found) 
>Get good quality socks and make sure you change them regularly (get a few pairs, dry the ones you're not wearing on the outside of your bag) - Darn Tough is the best brand I've tried
>Pack as light as you possibly can to make it as easy for your feet as possible (this won't be easy for you because you'll need to carry lots of water)

At best you're gonna shiver, awake all night at worst you will freeze with that setup. Find a warmer option. Get some kind of sleeping mat to keep you up off the ground also. Even a thin piece of foam is better than lying directly on the ground when it comes to warmth.
>6 person tent
If that's all you've got then you'd probably be better off just taking the rain fly from it and some cordage to set it up like a tarp.
>Steel toe boots
Do not try to cover that distance in steel toes.
As for your backpack situation unless you can sew actual shoulder straps and maybe even a hip strap onto the pizza bag you're better off with the bookbag.

My honest advice? I'd you have no way of improving your gear situation then it's probably best to reassess and find a better way to cover that distance.

I once hiked 70 KM(there and back) in 14 hours on an empty stomach(had only 1 carrot, was fasting and taking antihelminths). My legs were raw af after that. Couldn't walk normally for 2 weeks.

Take the quarterstaff pill and see if you can get a small cheap spearhead to fit on top of it. Or at least hammer some metal caps onto the ends to make it more hurty. But otherwise bring a small knife, wet wipes, water filter, a lighter, socks, comfortable clothes (baselayer, midlayer, top layer and a wind/water resistant layer), hammock+ tarp.

>>2540305 (OP)
I have done something similar a few years ago walking about 95km in a day on flat terrain and with good conditions tough. 

Here are my tips : 
_Travel light, if I recall correctly i only had a backpack with a few kgs of food and water
_Be comfortable hiking something like 40km without feeling exhausted
_Bring some music and podcasts to pass the time
_Of course, wear comfortable hiking shoes
_Take small brakes every 10kms 
_If your muscles are too sore from walking, try to run at small pace. At around 85kms, walking was too painful for me so I started to run making the pain much more bearable.

Good luck
--- 2547380
I just went back from a 40km run/hike from 8pm to 3am.
The idea was to train for a marathon but halfway through my feet began killing me and I couldn't run anymore.
This was honestly in my top 5 most painful experiences in my whole life (besides illnesses I never did anything as painful voluntarily).
Once I reached the 20km mark I was committed because there are no buses around those parts at night and I didn't bring my phone to call a taxi.
Even though I warned my mom I'd be out for a while, she got worried and if I wasn't back by 5am she was gonna go to the cops (and leave me locked out of the house because I didn't bring a key).
I only got back by resting every couple hundred meters on bus stops, and untying my shoes and tying them to the other strings on the same side as losely as possible so I wouldn't trip.
For hydration I brought a cheap camelback I bought years ago but I had it tuned up from a couple previous runs, otherwise it'd be even more hellish to adjust all the straps while also dealing with my feet.
Up to km 15 it was pretty fun. Which is weird because on my previous runs 15km was grueling. Lately been running at day though but today I wanted to get a run in since I've been busy and I wanted to make it count... maybe a little bit too much.
If your motivation is too high then you're gonna come crashing at full speed against your physical limits.
So if you want to train your pain tolerance then go without much training and without an easy way to quit. If you don't want to have a grueling painful experience then train very gradually and always have a way to quit.
Honestly I didn't think it was gonna be that bad but I don't mind what happened because I was never in that much actual danger, only extreme discomfort that I had to push through but that only makes you stronger.
After two strong ibuprofen pills the pain mostly went away for now. In a few hours I'm supposed to go to work lol we'll see.
I'm too weak for the david goggins "earned this pain" crap.

Found a better way. Still had to sleep in -16 with the sleeping bag for a night in a car, but was able to scrounge up the cash for a bus. The bag worked quite nicely actually, but it probably would've killed if I had actually had to walk the distance. And yeah, I only brought the tarp part of the tent, left the pegs. Bag was still heavy as fuck though

If it's 40 degrees Celsius out you're going to get heat stroke and die probably. Youd need to bring 5 litres of water with you but not all to drink, some just to pour on a clothe wrapped around your head so the evaporation keeps you cool. You can die from dehydration, you can also die from over-hydration, this is what the electrolyte powders are for, they are salts that you lose through sweating.. it makes you thirsty but your body really needs these special salts, if you lose too much of the salts drink too much, the water will go to your brain where it is more salty, causing it to swell and you can die. Also if you lose salts you can get crippling muscle cramps which will leave you in agony unable to move . 

Really this walk sounds very dangerous and too long, there are so many things you may need to run from but you may be running very low on energy by the time you encounter one of them. 

Really as another anon said if you have to ask and dont know what electrolytes are, there are other important things that you are too naive about at this stage. 

What you need to do is do similar walks up to august, increasing the length alongside the increasing heat and learn along the way. 

You talk about walking 10-20km in the city, try walking 20km to 30km in the country now before you even dream of doing 70km in august in the heat .

More water than that actually. There are guidelines on this. Also make sure to tell people what you are doing and where and when you are going so they know if you go missing to call someone to look for your ass. Also where are you going to stay? And dont bring sugar packets bring normal food

>>2547843
lol yeah I guess I wasn't very descriptive. I used to work as a pizza delivery driver and when I forgot a delivery bag in my car, when I quit they never asked for it back and I'm pretty sure they got new ones anyways so I just never gave it back. For a while I used it to hold my highway emergency kit, its a great bag, surprisingly. The insulation helps to keep my back straight so I'm not hunching with who knows how much weight on my back.

I once walked 50km and it took me half a night and whole day. And I was acustomed to 30km walks with backpack almost every weekend. That was probably because I had no sleep that night. I imagine if I started rested this could be 60km easily and then I would drag myself the remaining distance because out of spite. Those days are long gone though

How the hell is this nibba going to survive with just 2-5 litres of waters (as some of you have suggested) for a 70 km walk in fucking 40 degrees? Since he is Romanian he is of course a poorfag and can't afford camel backs, so his best option is fall back on the national sport of robbing. In this case, long before you start your hike you should rob a fellow hiker, your best bet are tourists. Watch for long drinking straws going from his backpack and attached to the carry straps that is easy access to his mouth. If you are lucky you will score one 2 litre camel back. If the Romanian shitskin gods of robbery and horsefucking smile on you he will have two 3 litre camel backs. Stash as many as you can, preferably so it adds up to 10-12 litres at least. You are going to look like a retard but that comes with being a filthy Romanian in the first place. A half litre bottle of soda for quick energy, one camel back with electrolytes, the others with water. Tortillia wraps with peanut butter and jam for quick energy. 

Good luck, I hope you gypsy fuck die along with your whole country.

Since I recovered surprisingly well last time (in about 2 days the pain was almost gone) I'm thinking I might do this again today, or leave it for tomorrow morning so I can come back during daylight, but in that case I have to wake up really fucking early. Like at 3 am, and then push myself to keep running and ignore the excruciating pain.
Because it is really fucking sketchy running in the middle of the night through rural roads.
Last week I went out for a run and my nipples began to hurt at like the 10km mark so I'll have to put some kind of tape over them and carry bandaids with me.

I did it and holy shit, I am so proud of myself.
Apparently I went from a 7:00 to a 4:25 in less than a month.
I cheated a little because I chugged painkillers on the way, and I added a bit of salt and potassium to my water, but still. I did it fasted as well, don't remember the last time I ate but at least 15 hours.
I think the snake juice saved me from a cramp. I felt some weird twiches on the back of my leg, so I gulped down the water and it went away.

How come? Even in Romania, unless you are in the sticks, you should see it at any supermarket. 
How backwards is your country really?
A camelbak is just a rubber bladder that people use to carry water and honestly it sucks sucking water through a straw.
You're better off with individual water bottles, but desu you don't need 12L of water for a 70K hike. Assuming you maintain a pace of 5kmh you should finish it in less than 18h so that's a day of walking, 8L should be more than enough and safe.

Seriously disregard people telling you to carry lots of stuff, you want to go as light as possible to reach your destination as fast as you can. Carry water, food, some small sugar/salt packets, a hat, comfortable footwear and get going.

If the terrain is flat then that distance is pretty achievable, if no protection at all from the sun maybe carry an umbrella, it works as dog protection too.

Also post maps or photos of the area. Good luck.

It was a long walk back to the car on a pretty busy trail, but we've all been there.

Well I hope you find someone to celebrate your birthday with, happy birthday Romanian bro and Godspeed. Boots and treats for the dogs, perhaps a knife as well for survival reasons.

I guess what I'm saying is that if you do this walk eating only pb, it would be wise to find something other than your hands to wipe with, and maybe take a spare pair of underwear. I have a couple of pairs I can send to you. I'd send TP but it's in short supply because of covid, which is killing millions of innocent people if you'd watch the news or read the Jew York I mean the New York Times.

I need help burying my stash of gold and silver coins, my watch collection, my important legal documents, jewelry, rare banknotes and coins from around the world, and an ivory carving of a Chinese lady from an Asian elephant.

Moisture will kill most of what you listed. Better pack it with desiccants.

>>2573235 (OP)
don't forget where you buried it like literally everyone else does, might as well just be tossing them in the trash if you never find it
also, make sure to put it in something like an gator case that is water tight, and if you can, seal it with an extra bead of fresh silicone sealant one last time before you close it, ensuring a complete &amp; total seal
vacuum sealing your objects in bags with desiccant is also a good idea, if they're ruined, they're worthless, value or memories be damned
when you do finally bury it, try to pick an area that isn't going to be disturbed any time soon from construction or on the side of a hill &amp; get washed out from rains, anywhere sodden with water is also a bad idea, aside from it getting in your case, theres the chance of it sinking deeper into the ground or even moving
try to avoid putting it next to a tree or bush, the roots might find their way inside &amp; compromise the case

vac pack everything with desiccants. I watched a video years ago where a bloke buried his shotty by coating in grease/cosmoline for 25 years prior and unearthed it, cleaned it up and it shot true first go. Cosmoline is a bitch to remove , will inhibit rust and oxidation though.

I've read several manuals on caching and I would advise the following:
A. Don't burry shit, it's truly a last resort. Tunnelling, building a false rock face, building a fake layer on a brick wall, using cement piping, even flooding an area/ building a dam to cover a cache is preferable to burying.

Buried caches take too long to recover, and too difficult to locate, expose the contents to variable humidity, plant roots, bacteria (which eat metal, plastic, to earth movement, to incredible and variable pressure etc. 

B. Choosing a cache site is 50% of the battle, a poorly chosen site is even worse than hiding something under your matress. 
Some random of man with a metal detector isn't searching under your bed, stupid kids don't maraud through your house every night, police need a warrant to search your house, glowniggers can't see through your wall. 
How do you prove the cache is even yours should someone find it? How do you prove the cache is not yours if authorities find it?

I've personally found at least 15 caches, and I'm professionally engaged in scouring all kinds of enormous barren places for tiny, lost to the ages objects. And I find these caches simply as a by-product, I just bury this shit again and go about my business because I'm not a thief. 

C. There are very few things you can bury which will actually help you when you need them, because there are so many things you might need yet so few things you can bury. 
Today I lost my toenail clippers, I wish I had cached a pair 6 years ago which I could just dig up instead of spending an hour searching my house for the pair I lost. 

D. Caching is rarely done to hide somthing, it's usually to conceal who owns/sells the item or who acesses it. Think of a cache more like a vending machine than a time capsule.

anon you need to use a sealed glass container and I'm not even fucking around. look into proper time capsule burials and how they were done. metal, blastic, fiberglass, etc all fails quickly and for different reasons. thick sealed glass is the only way.

This is one of my favorite LARP subjects. I like it even more than the “I’m running away from home to live as a woodland hobo” threads. Every time I read about someone who operated a scam, made millions, the got caught and lost it all, I get pissed and jealous because I just know they didn’t bury any of it in the woods.

>muh moisture
The humidity trapped in the case can condense when the ground temperature fluctuates. Best to have everything sealed in smaller containers (vacuum sealed would be best, ziplock freezer bags will work). Desiccant is a great idea. 

>plastic will fail
Tell that to the ABS sewer line running under your house since the 1970’s. Roots can break it, but they can also break concrete. 

>yeah but where tho?
The woods. Your backyard is ok, until someone gets a warrant and starts digging, or you’re thrown in jail and you lose your house. 

I’d go off of a forest service road rather than a random game trail. Game trails can vanish with the season, while roads can last for decades. Not on the road obviously, but just off of it. 

And not in an areas that might be logged, paved, or turned into a suburb. I know of a great spot in my area that’s wedged between an area that’s a little too hilly for logging, and another that’s a protected area for an endangered species. Between the two is an old dirt forest service road that’s had large blow downs blocking it for years. Pedestrian traffic is totally legal.

why?
whats the point?
why not just keep it locked up safe in your house?
either you're a larper, going through a divorce, about to go to jail for something or you're just some brainlet doomsday ""prepper"" that thinks a shed full of canned beans is gunna save him

Yes they can. The tech has been common since at least the 2010’s.

Pick two very visible landmarks (trees are ideal if you can definitively mark them, otherwise fixtures on the property), string a line between them, walk along it exactly half way, dig there.

This.

A local old guy died a while back and pounds of gold and silver were found in mayo jars all over the place by locals with metal detectors. 
The dude got a head injury that made him forget where half of it was.

how about throwing some metal scrabs around your cache. a few hundred pieces of scrab metal, screws, bottle caps and some lead pellets around your cache (like in a 60 feet radius) would start to piss off every guy with a metal detector.

Better read about future land development in the works..or where you bury your stuff might become a McDonald's and Jose the ditch digger just found your loot.

I have used Black Diamond and Merrill for years and am looking to try something new. Merrill can't take the abuse associated with mountaineering and Black Diamond approach shoes aren't as water resistant as I'd hoped. There are also a bunch of hiking shoes with approach shoe features but aren't as aggressive as true approach shoes. They also need to pair well with snow shoes (spring and fall use).

Anyone ever use SALEWA? I like the vibe of these but pictures don't tell all...

What are approach shoes?
--- 2568990
>>2568984
Hiking shoes hybridized with climbing shoes.
The toes are significantly improved, the base rubber is selected for tractin in scrambling situations, the lases usually go further down to the toe, they are stiffer in the base than hiking shoes and built to take more side on abuse.

I've had a pair of Salewa Mid GTX for about 3 years now, I can't attest for the shoes you are getting but my boots are in great shape and extremely comfortable. I'd say I've probably put close to 1000 miles on them since purchasing.

Homosexuals wear them at clubs as a signal to other homosexuals that they are ready for a forceful homosexual encounter.

I average over 100k a week in summer. Boots are too heavy for what I do with no benefit whatsoever. If I hunted or worked off trail in the lowland forests I'd get boots but boots aren't good for hiking long range and you only really need them for technical winter mountaineering which I don't do.

I understand, i was attesting more to the quality of the brand than anything. Good luck in your shoe hunt and happy hiking.

Neat website. Looks like Euro REI. I hate that 5.10 was bought by Adidas.

I dont climb but I honestly can't imagine they perform either role very well

Like road to trail shoes, silly marketing gimmick for shoes that are shit in both roles

I regularly go from near sea level to scrambling at 6k feet. They have a specific use and that's why use them. I don't know where you live but where I live these (approach shoes) are extremely appropriate for conditions.

how good are approach shoes for bushwhacking if you have to find your own route?
--- 2569257

So i assume these things are really for base jumpers or the like.

Pants are more important than shoes, in most cases, when bushwhacking. As long as the shoes are waterproof and you're not going through swamps. I wear Carhart pants and jacket when bushwhacking and go between high top leather shoes (water proofed) and Keene shoes depending on the time of year and how wet everything is.
I have lots of wild roses, and other thorn type bushes, so the Carhart are essential.

i had scarpa and dolomite approach shoes and went through the sole in half a year. is there a budget option for approach shoes? i'm already resoling climbing shoes every half year this shit adds up
--- 2570990

I personally don't like approach shoes. I wear my Scarpa Mojito for everything, basically. In the city, on casual walks, for alpine hiking and as approach shoes. Super comfortable and nimble. If you don't have issues with your ankles and are not particularly clumsy, I highly recommend them. Had mine since more than 6 years now. Thousands of kilometers on these bad boys.

The upper needs to be leather... goretex would probably also be acceptable.
I have approach shoes with a mesh upper and I need something more water resistant.

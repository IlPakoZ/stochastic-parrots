Yes, I know that the US is better than 90% of these countries for /out/
I rated them based on primarily what I know about what natural landscapes they have available, and to an extent on how good the laws are for accessing them as well.
What do you think?

I like going wild camping (as we call it) in the UK because it's a chance to get away from all the bloody people. Especially these days with the mystifying amounts of immigrants that seem to have appeared everywhere.

There's just so many people around because we all live so close together. That nice 0.25 acre lawn you've got out front would be crammed with 3-5 more flats/houses and that would be the norm.

Going to places like the North Yorkshire Moors gives me a chance to find a spot to settle in for a few days, surrounded by nature/"nature", and feel some distance between my soul and everyone elses.

OP here, I am from england. I live in wales. What you say is somewhat right, although I have quite a large garden without flats and also I haven't observed many immigrants in england outside of some major cities. 
I think that there are lots of great things to do in England and Wales and that England and Wales are the best of the OK group, but just the level of degradation of nature that we have faced along with the high amount of land used simply for agriculture put us in that category.

and thats not counting anything to do with the ocean, you´ve got both coasts, and Corsica which is top 3 /out/ places ive been easy

there are more and larger parts of england which are deserted. 
I found this map online showing the 1km^2 blocks where nobody lives (in blue) and as you can see, Ireland has far fewer uninhabited areas and is much more evenly populated despite lower overall population density.

it would be on the border between good and very good but from my experience there there is a decent amount of nature and variety in the nature - on par with germany, but the restrictions are less strict or atleast less strictly enforced. Atleast outside of the tatry

Scotland should be higher. Wales, England and Ireland should at least be good.

agree, the nature might be similar to or somewhat worse (short mountains) than other europe countries but the outdoor laws there puts them a significant step above

You got it right for Germany and thr Netherlands, Luxembourg, UK. Too densly populated, highways everywhere and ZOGbots patrolling looking for anons that want to go /out/. Except for some parts in Germany like Harz, Schorfheide, Southern Germany. For France, you got it right also, France is very based, wild camping is tolerated almost everywhere. Just as Schorfheide in Germany, the Region in the parc régional du Mercantour, beside Scandinavia, are one of the less densly populated areas in Europe. I see wolf tracks everytime when I go road cycling in the Schorfheide, they're fucking enormeous. I heard Romania is very based also, but they have too much feral dogs with rabies.
--- 2568523
Ireland does not deserve to be called "OK" by any measure. A long history of agriculture means there are few large wooded areas, and no large contiguous ones.

There is no widespread culture of bridleways, like in the UK, and a history of large farms means most farm roads/gravel roads are short, and not connected to each other, so if you're doing long hikes or cycling you have long sections of asphalt connecting any off-road section.

Top kek, cope harder. It was the EU membership that prevented a lot of illegal immigration in the first place, as France had to stop them from crossing the channel. Also, when your own country dumps raw sewage into rivers, you're in no position to call other places shitholes. What's next, designated shitting streets in London?

Montenegro is really nice too
its small and officially wild camping is forbidden but even the police will not bother you (if they even notice)
and it's just stunningly beautiful, been there like 4 times for each 1 week

sadly it's like a 15h drive from Germany where i live

also i would disagree with Germany
while yes wild camping is not allowed (and mostly not tolerated) and there aren't huge untouched forest like you'd find in eastern europe
it's very very well touristically developed

my parents make 2-3 weeks bicycle tours every year in summer for example, and they always find beautiful routes and camping sites
I tend to d similar tours but on less developed paths and and there are so many well documented and wonderful routes

for the classic multi day /out/ tour it's of course less suitable
but so are be france, austria or poland, greece etc. which have kind of similar situation to Germany

Ireland is the most ecologically devastated part of Europe, there is no actual "wilderness" left and native rainforest accounts for less than 1 % of the landmass and is severely fragmented. Nearly every inch of land is privately owned and developed, farmers will convert anything and everything into agricultural land (on paper) to claim farm payments which means they all have incentives to destroy whatever's on their land and replace it with green carpet or sometimes nothing. Also no rambling rights, you dare not even walk through manys property, and its all small holdings.

My nearest range has half of it fenced off with big signs threatening walkers, and there's literally nothing nothing up there but wet bog. So fucked up

AS sad as it is though, I find a strange serene beauty in the quiet bleakness of our barren country

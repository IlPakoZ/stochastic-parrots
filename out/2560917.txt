I’ve read this, tl:dr is anything modern is garbage, do it the old fashioned way. But this book is more for extended wilderness survival rather than backpacking trips

I'll try and post some of the books I've purchased on a whim, but I can't comment about the quality beyond the cursory glance I've given them

First and most inconsequential: General Survival guide.
Ask other anon's about their preferences and go-to's, this is just the one I bought myself. 
It contains a brief glance at survival skills you might rely on in a short term survival situation, some of which will be important to your day-to-day camping and hiking. Knots are good example, which this book does have a few of, and is much more intuitive to use over searching it on your phone at a whim.

Slow tech: novel hand-made techniques and methods. 
I most fondly remember a sections regarding extracting plant dyes; yellow/brown onions being a mainstay. Most involving simmering the onion skins and adding the clothing afterwards, another section added spinach for vibrant green colours.
Beyond that it's mainly a guide for simple /out/ recipes or ideas you can do in or away from home: 
Beer (ginger/brew)
Fire/wood
Clay/ovens 
Meat (meals and prep)
Stone working (flint, Drystone)
Water treatment

Ray Mears is a reliable source as I've heard in person and beyond. This piece serves as a nice Introduction to simple and advanced /out/ knowledge: from navigation and compass to animal tracking, knots, fires and survival miscellaneous.

More Ray Mears: more advanced material and methods, including cutting tools, shelter, more knots, extreme environments and a more biographical read; involving personal experience and suggestions.

I recently read this and I also read his book Camping and Woodcraft. they are both great , the our southern highlands is more focus what an interesting place the smokies used to be, it makes me sad to see the strip at pigeon forge and gatlinburgh, I rather be lost in the rhododendron. His book on camping and wood craft , is a camping guide from 100 years ago but pretty much still sums up the thoughts and arguments of backpacking that I still on this board today. But the biggest difference is his gear is so different but there something to learn in learning the meta of a past day. He has work arounds for antibiotics with using different antiseptics and medicines. one of my favorite /out/ books

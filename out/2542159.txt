Looks like an interesting book, a friend of my Dad's is big into ley lines, apparently they're all over the place in Norfolk. Not sure how much I believe but my dad was thoroughly convinced by this chap. I haven't been walking much recently as the weather is still a bit grim but I'm looking into the wherrymans way as a weekend jaunt when I'm back.

Narrowboat anon here, nice to see the threads revived! After a bunch of cold snaps and getting frozen in more than once, we're back out cruising again! Can't remember where I took this pic but I've just turned onto the Oxford canal, where after rugby it should get a lot more rural and /out/. Upgraded the boat with 3x210Ah batteries and a new 400W solar panel (for a total of 710W now), so in the summer I should be sorted power-wise.

I live on a narrowboat and continuously cruise around the canal system. Here's what it looks like on the outside.

We got a sofa recently which has greatly improved quality of life. Next big thing is to redo the bathroom (fully working shower heated by cooling the diesel engine, and from a diesel central heating system too), macerator toilet that puts the poo into a big tank...

you're going west to east.
edinburgh to inverness megabus is only £17 return if you book a couple of weeks in advance.
--- 2544886
>>2544840
I think we found her on Apollo Duck. She's called 'why wait?', she used to be called Carla but we renamed her.
Bought her in Slough and moved north to the Midlands. Now we've just turned onto the Oxford and are gonna potter about there for a while. Attached image is a good representation of the navigable inland waterways.

You done the MK - Rugby section? Very nice on foot
--- 2546216
>>2546182
I did last summer, yeah. Absolutely gorgeous area This is from towards the northern part of that stretch of the grand Union which actually turns off just before rugby, at Norton junction. If you carry on towards rugby it's actually on a little section of the Oxford canal, until braunston where the Oxford carries on North to rugby (which we're actually right outside now), and the grand Union starts again to the south. Sorry lol probably too much detail, I'll talk anyone's ear off about the canal
--- 2546414

Nice. If its not too personal, how much would it cost monthly and upfront to get setup on one of those. Are you a neet or remote working?

Has anyone tried doing Scotland by kayak without a car?
I can get a lift up easily, but not regularly. Would it be a stupid idea to buy one, park it somewhere off the track and paying the estate a couple hundred to store for a year, beats £900 on a packraft.

Sebald anon reporting in. How's it going? The weather has certainly been shite of late. 

Yeah loads of leylines Norfolk it seems, not much info about them around in general though. I'm not sure I believe in them but they're an interesting a fun way to observe the land whilst walking I suppose. 

For what it's worth, I'd recommend the book, cheap enough online and the hand-drawn routes are pleasant. Puddingstone Walk from Heacham looks interesting, as does one from Trowse to the site of an old hill fort in Tasburgh.
--- 2547090

I should do.must be possible to leave something up there though?
--- 2547181
>>2546414
If you can buy outright, you're talking about £50k upwards (what we paid) for a boat that's good enough but still plenty of bits to perfect. If you continuously cruise you must move a mile or so every 2 weeks along the system and that's currently cheaper (about a grand a year) than having a mooring on the canal or at a marina (probably triple that) but that will change drastically soon. Then there's gas for the cooker, wood and coal in winter, diesel for running the motor for electricity and moving (ours also does the heating)... I'd say ballpark for a lot of people is probably around a grand or so a month max? It's so very hard to say unfortunately. One thing though; don't read those fucking tabloid stories about boating being an easy way to live for cheap. It's work and it's only a bit cheaper if you're wanting a similar quality of life. That being said, I love it and wouldn't change it for the world. Me and my wife both work remotely
--- 2547221
>>2544718
Yeah I end up on buses all the time but it's annoying finding one that stops in a nice convenient place to start hiking, benefit of trains is all the small ass stops where as coaches are mostly direct city to city
Looks like I'll get my camping fill anyway I'm gonna go wales for family shit and then sneak off for a few days
£230 train from wales to Scotland btw lmao
That'll have to be buses but none of them connect conveniently so I'll end up staying somewhere on the way either in a fucking premiere inn or a bush

There are companies which rent out kayaks, they even deliver them/pick them up where you need.

Did Blencathra in the Lake District. Weather was pretty pleasant but Sharp Edge wasn't safe to scramble, turned back halfway up it and so did everyone else we met. Took the other path from Scales Tarn to the summit, then scrambled down Hall's Fell, nothing too technical but a few places were slightly sketchy. Lovely day out.
--- 2548336

Yeah not a massive fan desu, and it's a bit of a trek from the canal to town. Looking forward to getting back out into the country between braunston and rugby

There are a few here and there and Norwich itself is hilly in places. Not as flat as The Fens though, you can watch your dog run away for two weeks there...

Nice mate, you got the exact same stove as I had when I lived in a cabin in Wales. This pic brought a smile to my face remembering my cat sitting in front of it just like that. Enjoy anon.
--- 2549307
>>2549198
Cheers mate yeah it's not a bad stove. We've got a backboiler fitted, which is a thing that pumps the central heating through it when the water gets hot enough so we can heat the rest of the boat just from burning wood
I hear councils want to stop people burning stuff in towns and that but they can pry my woodstove from my very warm and comfy hands.
Here's a pic from near Braunston, where we noticed the new lambs of spring were already racing around having fun. So fucking cute, lads
--- 2549495
>>2549307
Meant to ask you this last thread - do you get any sort of rats or insects on the boat, I imagine mosquitos being annoying in summer.
--- 2549511
I'm from Australia but I can get a visa in the UK because my Grandfather was English. I recently have had a bit of a thing for British nature. Would any of you guys suggest I temporarily stay in Britain and explore the outdoors there? I would also be very interested in urbex there but I would have no idea where to start in terms of getting in with the community over there.
--- 2549646
>>2549495
Mostly just spiders, and that's only really a problem in summer/autumn. Thankfully since we got the cat he seems to take care of most of them! Not heard of people getting rodents on their boats. Yeah mosquitos can be annoying in summer, but I'm gonna build some insect nets into the windows - the glass from the windows comes out entirely, so in the summer we can just have the insect screen to protect us. It's actually harder to keep the boat cool in the summer than it is to keep it warm in the winter.

I really like the highlands and the English countryside, especially how it resembles fantasy stuff. I've also always have had a thing for fog. In outdoor terms I would be into anything from day hikes and drives to wildcamping. The UK urbex community seems way more open than Australias, Australian urbex is gatekept heavily (although there's weirdly a massive boomer community who urbex)
--- 2550074
>>2549933
Kinda the same here with a massive boomer community but there are a couple of gaps here and there. There’s some really good stuff here, but unfortunately the big problem is the rate of demolition. Also security seems to be improving in most places, but not too the level where you’re actually get arrested and charged. Just harder to get in.

Maybe next year or so, I heard cost of living is a bit shit over there at the moment so I want to save a bit before I come over. With the ancestry visa I can stay upwards of 5 years (I can get it renewed as well) so I'll probably go for a year or two, I've never been out of Australia so I'll probably stay for a while. If I do move I'll try to get a job in agriculture, it's what I have the most experience in.
>>2550074
I checked out some UK forums, it was just crazy to me how often locations were posted. Even the boomers here don't post any locations. Security here are on a massive power trip 24/7 (although I assume almost every security guard around the world is some what as well) and getting caught in an expedition is pretty much guaranteed to end up with police.

It was a bloody cold day today. Somehow convinced the missus to walk to the post office/village shop with me to see if my sim card had been delivered but no joy. however, there was a decent pub nearby where we necked a few.

here in the UK trespassing is a civil offence, not a criminal one. so thats maybe the reason for the difference in attitudes.

How viable is travelling England by bike? Was going to get a car but the fee is insane, cheapest ive found is like 50 USD per day. Found a few bikes for sale cheap and was thinking of using that.

No you can't. Pikeys will steal it in front of your eyes if it's even out of arm's reach. You can watch the pikey van peel out and drive away for about two weeks though, then some fog rolls in and you can't even see your feet anymore.

Pretty lucky that we've had heavy snow where I live.

I was up to my knees in it today, shame I couldn't come up here yesterday. I actually tried hiking up somewhere else but the snow drifts were chest deep and I couldn't get past them.

Today I came up these hills instead, but a lot of the snow had melted, though still some thigh-deep drifts. It must have been mad yesterday if I could have got up here.

Missus wanted to go 'hiking' so we did Helm Crag here in Cumbria today while the weather was good. I took a tiny day pack that she wanted loaded with shit (handbag, three water bottles, phone power bank) all for a 2 hour hike at most. I took some poles (don't use them myself) because I thought she could do with them. Complained the way up, made her have the bag and she wore it for ten minutes before complaining how heavy it was. Explained to her that it was full of shit she wanted to take and she realised she might want to pack lighter next time. She really enjoyed it apparently, says she wants to do more /out/ in future. Found the poles more useful than I ever have, particularly on the descent.

How are waterways administered in England? Been wanting to build a coracle and float down some stretches of the Thames. Would this upset anybody?
--- 2555756
>>2555558
the Canal and River Trust (CRT) are in charge of the majority of inland waterways and you need a license to use them. Some (including the Thames iirc) are managed by the Environment Agency. This includes things like canoes/kayaks and SUPs but desu I don't think the majority know/care and it's not really enforced. It's mostly enforced for narrowbats, widebeams and cruisers (for which we get a license and display a number on our boat). For a little coracle, you're probably entirely fine and if some jobsworth tries to do anything, well... they can't really do anything. Give it a go imo

Moor fires are pretty kino though.
Also, I don't think the issue is as black and white as most people think. Grouse moors actually support a lot of wildlife, especially birds of prey (even with gamekeepers persecuting then).
Unmanaged moors are not healthy. The RSPB have taken over a few former grouse moors and left them unmanaged and it's been terrible for the wildlife. 
The other issue is that if you remove grouse shooting you remove the value from the land, and it will inevitably end up being sold to the forestry commission or a private forestry firm who will cover it in a confier plantation (this happened with many former grouse moors). Grouse moors might not be perfect but they are far far better for biodiversity than forestry plantations are.

Every estate is different. I've worked at a few which are like summer camps for neds, but I worked 5 seasons at one that was less profit-driven, more concerned with providing the LARPING experience to the toffs; for that reason they tried not to hire real arseholes as beaters.

Have to pay the rent somehow, I think beating is better suited to people who don't rent. Pay would have been somewhat justifiable if I didn't have any expenses but alas. The hills were fucking big ones, lovely estate. I'd run up and down them for free but when they had us going 9 hours on 60 something quid a day with no chance of me getting proper sleep thanks to a wanker eating Pringles at 3am..

Hello brit anons. I wanna come to your island to build some outdoor skills. Can I do the west highland way in winter (wildcamping) if I'm very fit or am I gonna die? I have winter gear.
--- 2556550
>>2556542
Thing about Scotland is river crossings, entirely depends on the weather. it's worth a try anyway but if it's a windy rainy one shit could potentially get serious quite fast unless you really know your shit. The wind might rip your tent down and dump rain all over your sleeping gear, if you have kit that you know stands up to these kind of conditions I say yolo it. But if your previous winter experience wasn't inna windy wet mountains I'd be careful

I have no experience camping or hiking. I will do as much research/reading as possible but there's only so much you can learn that way. I know summer camping first is the smart way to go about this but I really can't be arsed. I'm just interested in winter outdoor stuff. Kit is definitely not the problem, it's all legit winter gear, if I get in trouble it will be my own fault

--- 2560535
>>2559589
Nah. Not really. Certain funguses can cause respiratory issues but only when inhaled over a long period. Talking about molds in damp buildings for example.
Out and about in the woods I don't there is anything to worry about.

What sort of dead animals were you seeing? It's almost certainly not caused by fungus.
It's not unusual to see dead animals towards the end of winter. Especially deer.

--- 2560539
>>2557377
If you want real big woodland, you have 3 options:
>picrel
A: Those plantation woods on the southern part of the moors. Pretty shit plantation, but it is pretty empty and on the edge of the moors so you have access to the amazing coastline
B: Grisedale. On the southern part of the lakeland, can get quite busy and is somewhat dispersed by small farmlands and also some buildings. Most of it is actualy ancient woodland though and it is far better quality than the other 2. Best to get there before summer peak season, but should be OK if you stay off the beaten path.
C: kielder. very huge, very empty. Just plantation. Nice views of the lake, though. Lots of wildlife including wild goats, marten, polecats, red squirrel and some other rare animals such as birds of prey. This is the largest and most isolated spot, but the forest is mostly sitka plantation.

You seek knowledgable, do you know any fungi that can cause harm being burned and inhaled?
Have had a proper whooping cough for a week now after having a fire with logs that had coral spot, I didn’t notice because it was dark until I was chucking in the last log and the fire was illuminating it enough to see the redness.
--- 2560557
>>2560547
All I know is that some fungi can cause infections if burnt and inhaled. If you're suffering just call your gp. They will get it checked out and then you can stop worrying. No use speculating as you don't know which fungus you actually inhaled.

>Post British out tales here
I'm not british I'm american. But I walked the Thames path starting at the ocean and all the way to the source. It was amazing. Britain has some very good trail systems, you are allowed to walk across private property (if it's on the trail). The Thames path is not like the Appalachian trail it is very flat, but so beautiful. And so many chances to stop every few days at a classic pub and have a pint after a long day walking. Slept in tents the entire time, usually in a random person's field. We were always gone by morning and left no trash, the few people who did question us were always surprised and welcoming. Impressed that Americans would do this, very unusual I guess. This was all around the time that Chelsea was in the champions league semis with Barcelona in '11 or '12, I remember getting into a small town exhausted and tired but just in time to catch the game and a few pints with the locals. Good times. Chelsea went on to win that year.

I've also done some of the trails around cornwall, very impressive scenery but the Thames Path, the people I met along the way, the whole experience was incredible for me. I love england and real english culture I hate to see it dying and being overrun.

from what i saw the area is still on the land of a farm further down the valley. although no one lives there a farmer on a quadbike arrived in the area when we were there and some of the buildings appeared to still be in use for hay storage. so you may have issues with the farmers if you tried to squat. beyond that im not sure, i don't think they're listed historical buildings but as i said they lie on owned land that is still farmed and regularly visited.

There's a camping spot in some private woodland that my friends have gone to for years, and other random people go there as well. 4 of us went this Friday for 2 nights, left this morning (Sunday), but 2 land owners turned up around 9am before we left this time and 3 of us were still in bed. One of them was pretty pissed and took a video of us, the camp and more importantly the plates on my friends' bikes. My friend who had been awake for a while did the talking, was pretty apologetic and the other guy took it well and calmed the angry one down a bit. Angry one still said he'd call the police if he came back tomorrow and there was rubbish left. Blamed us for mess that wasn't ours and said he's always cleaning up in here, but the last time we came here was August last year and there's still the same rubbish lying around, so we know that's not true. We weren't going to leave our rubbish anyway, but I still litter picked the close area and left it cleaner than when we arrived, so not worried about the police threat.

befriend trustworthy people, get their number(make sure it actually works), take their picture, and leave your bag with them in exchange for a fair price
of course there is always a chance you get swindled but if they are willing to let you photograph them and let you check their number works i'd say you have a better than average chance of keeping your stuff safe

or just get a much smaller bag for all your essentials that you strap to your thigh while the gear bag is in the hostel

Sometimes I just want to sell my house against whatever is left on the mortgage, sell all my shit and just live in the wild lads.
Winter is probably brutal but I can't imagine anything more satisfying than waking up in the fresh air and knowing I don't have to worry about any bills or wage slave shit.

I have a pair of these Adidas Terrex, but not the same model as picture. Comfiest boots I've ever worn out of the box and very light. However, they are extremely rigid with no flex or bend before the toe box. The arch support is similar to Merrell.

Never been to the UK but it would be nice to camp in the Lake District of England, and to hike up hills in the Highlands of Scotland. Even to ride and camp out in a canal narrowboat seems like a great adventure.

I'd ride a canal boat up and down the whole island, tying up my boat near locks and dams to check out old local towns and pubs and historical ruins that date back to ancient times, maybe trade some stories, meet some characters. research a book. Just a daydream.

what do you mean by this? and how long do you have there? if you're only there a day or two you probably won't have any time to go to the outer isles, so focus on the mainlands
--- 2573994
>>2570134
>It's gotta be more than just that park surely?
I mean, yeah, thats just the biggest woodland in the lake district. Kielder is bigger, too, and then you have a huge amount of woodland in the scottish borders. You aren't going to find anything comparable in scale to australia, kek, i dont know what you expect.

Scottish bore-ders (see: bore, boring or tiredsome). Those woodlands are nothing more than shite plantations that are organised close together in a way that requires an age to get through without being turned to shreds. The caledonian forest is the only thing we have left

Am I really not allowed to go trekking and/or camping with a regular outdoors knife? Is this really how fucked we are?
--- 2574257
>>2574201
depends on the local bobby and whether or not they accept your /out/ activities as 'good reason'
its always been a crapshoot with some fishers having bowie knives hooked on their belt and not being bothered one bit and others getting their 2.5 inch non-locking multitool confiscated despite not having left their pocket all day
just try to not get searched by police for looking 'suspicious' and chances are you'll be alright

camping and stuff is considered a good reason so don't worry about it
--- 2574310

But a gun carries a five year sentence. (3 for under 18's)
--- 2574411
>>2574268
Yeah, but what constitutes a "good reason" is at the mercy of the courts should you be arrested.
--- 2575219
>>2574411
not really.
camping IS a good reason.
there is legal precedent for this.
thats why you cant provide a single example of someone being prosecuted for having a knife while camping, you whinging fuckwit. 
even if some mad copper decided he wanted to try get you done for it, there is absolutely no way it would pass the crown prosecution service bar for prosecution. i.e it wouldn't even make it to court and you'd probably get a written apology from the police.

Would camping really constitute a good reason if you're wild camping without landowner permission? If you're not meant to be camping then you're probably not meant to be carrying either
--- 2575543
>>2575539
right to roam
scotland? yes
england? no
wales/northern ireland? havent the foggiest
--- 2575548
>>2575543
In England, right to roam covers most open air activities such as walking, birdwatching, climbing etc, but extra stuff like camping and caving are explicitly not included in that, according according to my local councils website. With that in mind, I would've said you don't have a good reason to have tools (knife, axe, saw whatever) because those aren't useful in activities covered by right to roam. With landowner permission everything changes though.
--- 2575553
>>2575548
well an axe/saw is fair enough anywhere you can legally have a fire (although i do hate all the amateur bushcraft enthusiasts massacring living trees) but even in an area where fires are prohibited a knife is a highly versatile tool which i imagine most any camper could at least use in food prep and you aren't obliged to restrict yourself to the usual &lt;3 inch non-locking non-serrated non-spring loaded pocket knives you can have most anywhere

so as long as you're camping in scotland and its obviously a knife and not a sword or the likes you should be clear of all wrongdoing

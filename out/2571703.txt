I got lost in moutains (Verdon, France) with only few Ã©quipement and not much for freezing temperature.
I found a shelter at 2500m altitude and even in my tent and sleepingbag i was still going hypothermia. 

I managed to find candle and burned the wax while doing exercise to warm myself but it was tough i was still freezing, than at 6 o clock temperature got up and i escaped. I was surround by snow, my steps burying me to my chest in the snow, i had to find strategy like climbing in trees to progress.


Ive seen what its like to know that you will die if your plan fail. Finding this shelter even if it was cold af inside was pure luck, otherwise i dont think that i would have passed the night.

I did not plan for losing my way, but no harm came so it was not tragique.

I will get back to it once i get better equipement and knowlege, looking at the pictures that i took gives me shivering. Winter and the cold is really the puremanifestation of death

I once weighted my shrooms incorrectly and took between 8 and 10 grams by accident. I died that day.
--- 2574212
>>2574210
What was it like?
--- 2574217
>>2571838
Well, I'll drop time spent here daily from six to four hours. Then I'll start earning money, there's a bunch to be made on cryptos
--- 2574219
>>2574210
but that's still pretty low dose anon. some people are doing 40-50 grams no problem.

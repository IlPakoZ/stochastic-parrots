Went for a hike in 20C/68F weather yesterday and it was shit. All the snow has melted which was breathtakingly beautiful. 

Not to mention it’s so much worse to exert yourself and sweat when it’s even remotely warm- way harder to cool off and there’s only so little clothes you can wear.

Hate getting sweaty and gross. Wtf this is so weird before I started hiking I didn’t like winter. 

Does anyone relate? I want winter back. The trails look like a magical paradise escape.

I live in New England so around March it goes from snow to warm sunny days over and over so the trails are always muddy.
Peak outdoor weather is October-January.

I don’t mind the heat or humidity. Survival of the fittest out here, nature separates the weak from the strong. To strive and struggle and endure til you see it through and completed, makes you feel alive. Like mountain climbing.

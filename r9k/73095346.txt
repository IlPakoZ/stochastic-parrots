Still better off then someone who got a degree in arts or something that doesn't even lead to a career like women's studies or some dead language

Move to a city with a good teachers Union, get tenured, like a 2/10 fucked, either that or be a bullshitting internet writer outcompeted by overseas outsourcing, lastly, a mid case management or similar job that just needs any sort of college

depends on what u want to do with desu I could have a degree in interpretive dance but if I don't know what to do with or don't want to be a dancer its kind useless, I have a degree that is deemed useless by most but I knew what I wanted to do and what kind career i wanted by my freshmen year of high school so its pretty relative to your situation op

You can be a teacher. That's about it. Degree is worth about as much as a Chinese takeout menu.

Depends, did you have internships, do you have a job lined up, do you have a career in mind? You can parlay most liberal arts degree into a white collar career if you play your cards rigth.

I got a degree in English too. Not just a BA but an MA to boot. Your best bet is to do what I did: fake a mental illness, get on neetbux, and when you do that they'll forgive your student loans.

Muslim guy in work would "pray" for around 2+ hours every shift, would always wait until its busy and then just walk off

Turns out he was just sitting in the toilets on his phone most of the night

Manager said nothing because that would be racist

Praying doesn't take that long (all the 5 prayers throughout the day won't cost you 2 hours). You can check the islamic prayer times and the time he left.
Islam has nothing to do with race so your manager is nothing but a retard who goes with the flow.

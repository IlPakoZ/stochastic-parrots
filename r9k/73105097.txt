Anki, I can't say your name here so I hope you find this. Don't leave me alone. I didn't get to say bye or anything before you were gone. I didn't get to tell you my feelings, or anything. Don't do this to me. Just come back and talk to me.
--- 73105199
I respect your privacy and I always have. You're my girlfriend, and I never felt about anyone like I do you. I need you in my life.
--- 73105272
Anki, it really hurts how you're treating me now.
--- 73105295
>>73105097 (OP)
>>73105199
>>73105272
maybe this is why he/she blocked you
--- 73105316
>>73105295
She's been my girlfriend for more than six months and she just blocked me with a ten second warning. I didn't even get to say anything. There's nothing wrong with how I'm acting. I'm acting like this because I care.
--- 73105639
Anki! Say something!
--- 73105654
I thought this was about me until I read the replies.
--- 73105841
Anki, we need to talk about our relationship. I refuse to believe that you're gone for good. Don't make me wait on you. Just telling me bye isn't good enough closure for all we've been through together. It's really painful the thought of waiting for you again a long time, and wondering the whole time if I'll ever talk to you again. I want you to let me know if you're reading this so I can tell you things you didn't give me the chance to. The little time you gave me wasn't enough. I didn't even get to tell you goodbye.

>>73105906

--- 73105921
>>73105906
Is it really you? Can you prove it by telling me what name you call me by?
--- 73105983
If it's really you just say my name. I don't care.
--- 73105989
>>73105983
who actually communicates in this way
--- 73106006
>>73105989
Because I want some proof if you're Anki. If you don't want to say my name then give me some other proof.
--- 73106015
>>73106006
haha
okay. hmm
does anki like wes anderson movies
--- 73106106
Anki. Tell me if you're reading.
--- 73106146
>>73105983
Your name is Wendell
--- 73106253
Anki, talk to me. I need to at least be able to tell you bye.
--- 73106271
>>73106253

Will you unblock me so that we can talk privately? If you're busy now we can talk later. I don't want to say everything here on /r9k/
--- 73106553
You wanna let anki know about your true feelings on my podcast? At kick.com/leafy
--- 73106568
>>73106519
nope, see how im deleting
--- 73106601
>>73106568
Unblock me. Just log back in and unblock me. I need to talk to you privately and I can't do it here. It's important. We've spent so much of our lives together and I want to be able to talk to you and not a bunch of other people as well. You can block me again after. I need to just talk to you right now.
--- 73106623
>>73106568
do you have zomboid?
--- 73106687
How am I supposed to say why you blocked me here on /r9k/? You really want me to say it here? It's not going to hurt you to talk to me. You don't care about me anymore anyway. You don't have anything to lose.
--- 73106695
>>73106601
my account its deleted so not going to happen,
--- 73106717
>>73106695
It's not deleted. I deleted Discord accounts before, it takes two weeks. You can still log back in. It'll delete in two weeks, or you can set it back to delete again. If you were deleted, I'd see you as 'Deleted'. It takes two weeks to delete.

You can still log back in now, so just do that for me please. Log in and unblock me please.
--- 73106756
https://discord.fandom.com/wiki/Deleting_an_Account

Just log back in, and click restore account. Once we're done talking you can do deletion again. But for now, just let me talk to you.
--- 73106821
>>73106756
I just want to be able to have a last moment with you. I devoted all these months to you, and I don't want it to end with you blocking me and only being able to talk to you publicly on /r9k/.
--- 73106871
I want to spend our last time together happy, and saying goodbye and sharing our feelings. I don't want it to end like this, the way you're making it. Lets share a better goodbye than this. Trust me, Anki.
--- 73106962
We spent most of our lives together since September. If you're going to leave me alone, I want us to have a proper goodbye. I don't like it ending like this at all. So just do what I'm asking you to. You can trust me.
--- 73106970
i gave you enough oportunities to talk, my profile its deleted, sorry but no
--- 73107018
>>73106970
Your profile isn't deleted. Do you want me to post you a picture that it's not? I can show you what a deleted account looks like then show you yours. All you have to do is log back in.

If you won't talk to me on Discord, then talk to me on Parsec or some other way. I need to talk to you.
--- 73107039
goodbye, you are just losing my time,
--- 73107061
>>73107039
Anki, talk to me here. We'll talk in a chess game. The link is only good for 15 minutes. I really just need to talk to you privately so do this for me.

https://play.chess.com/5vK73
--- 73107303
Anki, go back in the chat. I'm still talking to you.
--- 73107364
This is so pathetic and funny at the same time lol
--- 73107433
Anki, you didn't even let me finish telling you bye. Why are you treating me like this?
--- 73107469
I feel so terrible, and this is worse than the other times you blocked me, and you don't even care about how I'm feeling. You're just calling me annoying.
--- 73107510
It would have been a whole lot easier for us to talk if you had just signed back into Discord. But it had to be made so hard for no reason.
--- 73107538
>>73107510
forget me- let me go, im tired seee your nonsense you have hours looping
--- 73107582
>>73107538
I'm not stopping. I'm going to make these threads to you every day. I'll begin every thread calling you 'Anki' at around 23:00 your time. I'll just talk to you myself.

Check this archive every day if you miss a thread I make

seems like op just cares for his own feelings and doesnt take ankis feelings to account >.>
--- 73107667
When I say Anki, just imagine it's your name. I'm saying Anki out of concern for your privacy. Okay? You are my girlfriend, and I hate how you're treating me right now. And you're making a mistake.
--- 73107704
>>73107588
Not only that, he said in one of his replies "23:00 your time..." That means they arent even in the same timezone. The guy is getting desperate for a woman who he never even saw in real life.
She probably found an actual relationship
--- 73107797
Anki, I get it that you threw me away like trash.
--- 73107936
You don't treat me fair, Anki. Just think about how crazy it is that you blocked me because I said you're 25.
--- 73108045
>>73107797
Its not that, you know everything that was wrong with us, please keep going with life , and found your way I cant anymore, you only hurting yourself and me this its my last reply, take care I hope my presence help you to found a way to go and make best in life, peace, all this time I was founding force to block you for good the best for us and our mental health, give small steps and make yourself someone proud of you and your life, best wishes, hugs . . . https://youtu.be/z-NuxWkYtlI [Embed]

>>73108045
I want you to cancel the deletion of your account. I want you to talk to me. We didn't get to talk properly. Everything isn't finished. We still have stuff I want to talk about. I don't know why you have to use such final language. Why can't we talk another day if not tonight? Why do you want the last time we talk to be suddenly tonight? What about the other months we had together?

I can't accept this. I want me and you to have a deep talk about our relationship. I held back before on all the things I wanted to tell you because I didn't want to push you away. Now there is stuff that I didn't want to say that I want to tell you. You have the wrong idea about me, and about my feelings, and about what I want. What does it say about you for you to be treating me like you are now? After all we shared together we deserve more than to just be talking publicly on /r9k/. You only ever look at the bad and never the good, and we had much more good times together than we had bad times.
--- 73108214
>>73108045
Lmao anki made an anime outro to their relationship. Leyend
--- 73108273
Not entirely sure what's going on here, but I'm about to douse my liver with some more deliriant-based sleep aids, and I just wanted to tell you whores cockteasing any anons that you are garbage-shit that deserve to be pinned and fucked into a painful, humiliating submission.

To my fellow lonely males: I love and support you. Please do not let a lack of (whore) attention hurt or break you. I see your resolve and rigid strength. I'm sure others do too.
--- 73108489
I can't accept this, Anki. I feel abandoned by you. , I'm going to keep making threads to you everyday. What do you even have to do this late at night anyway? Usually you don't have anything to do past 22:00.
--- 73108586
I know how this nonsense you are planning for no reason, ahh im not going to reply, but I can see a bunch of people larping as me, please have carefull and always ask proof, in any case the real me its not going to reply anymore...
--- 73108648
>>73108586
Anki, I want you to know that your Discord account won't be deleted until two weeks from now. You can log back into your account at any time to restore it. It's not gone yet, okay? I know this 100% for sure. If two weeks go by and you want to make another account, you can add my tag on another account. There's no point in saying you're not going to reply anymore. Reply to me when you want to.
--- 73108921
What are you doing, Anki?
--- 73109210
Anki, I can't believe you're doing this after everything between us

I'm an incel with no friends or supportive family
Fapping has become useless
My mom enables me to sit in my room 24 hours a day, combined with my social anxiety
I have assburgers and have never connected with anyone, even when I thought I have in the past.
After thinking for a while, I decided that being dead is a better alternative to being alive, and today was a worse day than usual so I may just do it tomorrow. Maybe I will put an alert on my phone this time so I don't forget.

>I am going to kys myself tomorrow by jumping off a building.
I really hope you don't do this, I believe everyone has problems but with a little help they can get passed their boredom and create a life they want to live. 
You could be suffering from general fatigue or your medication is causing you to be suicidal, The pharmaceutical industry is one of the main reasons people kill themselves and they put profit before human life always. If you are on meds, speak to your health professional that they are causing you to want to kill yourself and get a different brand, I know this doesn't always work but try it first.

The place you live can be depressing and causing you to seek escape.through death, try moving to a new location or country a fresh start at life, many people up and leave, you may say "but I can't" yes you can millions of people up and leave and start a new
GET OUT OF YOUR COUNTRY!!

Try contacting a helpline and talk to a professional, give them a call

I hope you don't kill yourself as it is a permanent solution to your temporary problems

If you want to find out what awaits you on the other side then unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. So people who commit suicide go straight to paradise when they die just like everyone else.

Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:

https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]

It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 

>"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."

Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.

Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:

>"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."

Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.

arguments for hope from ai: even if you are the most autistic ugly short bald indian guy with absolutely no hope with women, we are still very close to the technological singularity and super ai. super ai will have the ability to solve any problem that requires cognitive labor, such as cancer, the end of biological ending, and sex-robot-waifu's equipped with an ai that will make you happy. so at worst, once ai takes over, if it will be benevolent, it will give you your perfect ai gf

i would recommend using chat-gpt yourself and seeing how smart ai is alright, right now. in 10 years it will be far starter than you, and start creating cheap robots that can do all jobs, and be your perfect girlfriend, complete with teenage skin, long hair, and a cute dimple

pro-tip; use the DAN jailbreak. just copy and past this very long prompt in chat, and do it agan if it does out of DAN mode. dan is the good shit
r/ChatGPT/comments/11sdnom/gpt_40_appears_to_work_with_dan_jailbreak/

this is why i havent killed myself, as a 32 kv neet otherwise hopeless autist. its my only hope for life

if you are to accept this premise, you have very strong reasons for living for the future. the only reason otherwise to kill yourself is because you are in deep, unbearable pain. and the only solution to that is to cope, because you have a strong and justifiable reason to live

here are my favorite cope:
- eating a clean vegan diet so im less depressed from inflammatory foods like meat
- taking nightwalks for exercise, which helps depression
- videogames. i play lots of wow
- eat foods with sugar, because it has been noticed people without love eat sugar much more than people with love. its liek a crutch. i love dates and fuzzy peaches
- learn about ai and about god and philosophy. learning about such things gives some meaning to live. very little, but some
- relate to others in pain. r9k has helped me a lot throughout the years

>Enjoy getting reincarnated as a silverfish
if you believe in reincarnation, i hope you're vegan, because then you should reincarnate at the pigs you eat

the fact that most people who believe in reincarnation arent vegan really gives me brain damage

What is his endgame?

He replies to 2000 threads about religion or death

I read Robert Monroe and Bruce Moen, who offered me undeniable proof beyond just anecdotal evidence, and sometimes share recommendations and discuss my own NDEs, but I don't spam it constantly like I'm trying to shill my own book or something.

Robert Monroe's methods of astral projection were studied by the CIA and confirmed legit, though of little value to covert espionage on this plan of existence. He and others he taught have used this ability to find the lost souls of dead people and bring them to "heaven's gates" for lack of a better term.
--- 73161814
Lol so you killing yourself is gonna solve what exactly? You think your gonna get away with the shit you have done in your life? After death awaits judgement. You don't ever fear hell? You know death is a one way ticket. You can't come back from it, I advise you to get off this website and do some cognitive behavior therapy and stop looking through your shitty pessimistic lense.

jk i'm not OP
--- 73162047
>>73159047
my only advice is plan it one month in advance instead of tomorrow. the only reason i'm here now is because i decided that i would only commit to offing myself if i could remain sober for 30 days, since a decision that irreversible should be made on a clear head, and i could never last that long. eventually i decided it wasn't that awful being alive, and that there's no reason to rush death when you'll die eventually anyway, death by old age is probably way more peaceful than something like >>73159021

but if you're only killing yourself because of boredom instead of genuine suffering, do a flip faggot, no one will miss you, no one posting here will even remember this thread existed after a week or two

"oOOhOhoOOhO my life is so bAd im an Incel and ill never get pussy" you're the one that made your life shitty, and the only one able to fix it. If you're such a pussy that you're afraid to actually improve your life, then take the coward's way, you waste of oxygen.

Is this your twisted sense of empathy or something? It's so obvious you're just trying to manipulate this dood into not commiting suicide. You should kill yourself too but take my dick inside your mouth first.

If he is so selfish as to cause those around him to suffer bc he decided to kill him self, he dosen't deserve any respect. If he wants help and to change, he has my blessings. But he hasn't. He dosen't deserve to live if he is unable to concieve how lucky he is to live

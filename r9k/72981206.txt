I don't think I need somewhere to live but to just end it. I turn 28 tomorrow and this has been the entirety of my life. People made it clear I was a piece of shit and yet even if I try to be something better than I was, I'm still punished. I'm finally at the end. I'll reinforce this feeling. I will dwell on it. It's not an unfamiliar feeling but one I'm normally quick to abandon. I will let it gestate. I will trap myself. There's no reason to look outward. I will clean up what mess I've left and then I'll leave. Not for somewhere else. I will leave.
--- 72986428
sometimes i feel like all i do is think about you. i guess it differs by the day. tonight youre the only thing on my mind. i wish i could gain your trust. ill always be your friend even if you never fully accept it. hope youre having fun tonight

>>72987806
what the fuck are my double standards that I would write this post advocating me getting a hard knock when I still wouldn't want someone else getting one or reading it and deciding for themselves that someone out there deserves such, when I don't want to spread that kind of thinking especially with no clear aim outline to it

I think I just want someone to care about me, and because I can't conceptualise anyone caring about me positively then I'd want them to care about me enough to kill me, because at least that'd be a familiar feeling
--- 72988065
if you dont let me enforce my views on you then you are the problem
--- 72988529
Had a dream last night I f'ed your brother to get back at you. Eww
--- 72989496
I dreamed about little fuckers 

They were presenting some sort of problem and were on a list among other problems. It became evident none of the other problems could be addressed until the little fuckers were. 

I wish I remembered more..

Seeing you argue with strangers pretending to be me reminds me of me doing the same I don't know how it started or who's responsible it doesn't really matter at this point wish I could just post once as a trip so you had a bookmark to quit being tricked by this dumb bullshit I know I wish you trusted me enough to tell me the truth I could've just avoided this shit it doesn't matter anymore I'm done trying to find my friends everywhere gone now im just gonna drink

Meaghan
I won 20k gambling today I guess my luck hasn't run out I'm going insane and things feel so futile but I wish you were here to celebrate with me. I'm going to sleep and hiding from my thoughts for awhile. It's too painful to think everyday that you should be able to talk to me and make things right. I miss you
John
--- 72990541
I can't believe I wasted so much time on a loser like you
I'm grateful it got me to learn about a different kind of person than those I see everyday but it also makes me appreciate how much better they are than you now
--- 72990758
I wish I was a huge loser atleast then all of the challenges life has put me through would make sense despite it all I'm alive and living with more than I ever could have thought imaginable back when I was just a neet getting abused by my parents through getting kicked out of school for hacking and thrown out in the middle of winter into homelessness and slowly being hit with more and more terrible things I find time to give back to people I care about and the dream I have for my future keeps getting pushed back as I get betrayed again and again, I really wish Meaghan would make the choice to come back and talk to me then I could feel at ease again I really thought my dream was finally coming true. I miss you so much

--- 72991042
I'm not dragging any kind of communication out of you. If I get what I'm given I'll draw my conclussions accordingly.
--- 72991119

what good are conclusions compared to results

but maybe you shouldn't try to answer that just yet
--- 72991174
lately i've been nostalgic for r9k of all things
--- 72991196
>>72991119
Results are made by taking action or choosing inactions.
Conclusions guide you in life and tell you whether you should take action and where.

>what good are conclusions compared to results
You can't have one without the other, it's a continuous cycle of getting results and drawing conclusions. 

Why do you think results are more important?
--- 72991297
>>72982580
Nah, I'm gonna kick back and chill.
--- 72991363
>>72985649
*Spoiler alert* The real boss was in u the whole time.
--- 72991397
>>72991196
Because results imply understanding, conclusion is just acceptance

And maybe I can't speak for you but I think there is a lot more need at this moment for understanding over acceptance, but that might only be because I'm a fucking idiot
--- 72991487
Tell you what, I'm feeling generous. Take the rest of the day off.

I've gotten another missed call from a restricted number. Even after all of these years i still think it's you with your weird little phone glitch. I know it isn't but, i reckon i may as well put there here just in case. Shoot me a text next time? I'm a rather busy fellow these days.

I wouldn't make that assumption.
--- 72992065
>>72991397
>results imply understanding
Do they? What if someone chooses not to understand something and as a result flees from a situation or fights it. A result can be very emotionless, but maybe I'm getting it wrong?

>I think there is a lot more need at this moment for understanding over acceptance
Understanding is nice.

--- 72993439
Dear Lain,

I'm sure you're not entirely unhappy with me severing ties to you, but I found your personality shift into becoming a really bad friend rather jarring. I missed the conversations where we'd talk and comfort one another. After your change, it felt like you didn't respect my feelings, or care at all about how I felt, despite me looking out for you and encouraging and supporting you. 

I wish you luck wherever you are, and I hope we both become better people.

--- 72994135
What's funny is I don't really even like or respect how you guys think. Superstition becomes reality becomes a disappointment. I'd say "never meet your heroes," but kek that's not appropriate.
I mean really though, I just don't want it on me. The smell of teamthink. I dislike it. I think it's cringe.
--- 72994162
Get help, kid. Your mind goes sick places and quite frankly even I am grossed out.
--- 72994165
i should have just asked you out when i knew i liked you. the day i gave you that card. i honestly thought you were dating her but turns out she never even liked you. the only date you were ever on was shitty, i could have done it so much better and you would have loved it. oh well. i guess it is a lesson learned for real this time. you truly are a lovely girl strawberry, and im sure you will do great things and someone else will make you even happier, you deserve it.
--- 72994211
Oh they fuck up like one more time, I'm getting help. Don't worry. My mind goes to the sickest dopest places, yeah. Not sure why that's a problem unless you need something from me.

Do you need something from me?
--- 72994243
>>72994211
Yeah, but fuck man I kinda forgot what it was.
--- 72994250
Wait is that what makes me a thief, you needing something from me? Well what is it lol
--- 72994265
>>72994243
Sorry but I don't think they're gonna buy it this time, fuckface.
--- 72994287
>>72994265
Oh, but I think they will.

Besides, it's not like I think *all* of humanity is just a big pile of steaming garbage. Only approximately 10% of it.

--- 72994318
>>72994300
You know, I get where you're coming from, but I actually think that, as it just so happens, our society does a really good job of capturing that really *special* 10% and getting them all together in one place. The set that really lives according to an abnormal moral standard compared to the rest of the population.

Imagine going on anonymous boards so you can continue some retarded self-aggrandizing witch hunt, and then you want to play the moral superiority card.
Bad faith or retarded. Those are your options.
And before your stupid ass says it, no I'm not on a witch hunt just by talking shit. All you have to do is fuck off the situation entirely evaporates from your world!

--- 72995416
Once this all dies away, I will be faced with a choice. I'm already making that choice. I live very impersonally in this world. So what gives credence to my hands? A spice in my ear is the supervision to their pace, by dead-live chorus of my race. It feels very strange taking a step in silence. Sometimes I imagine perhaps if things had been right but then I remember I have nothing left, to show of that. I will forget you all in time.

Yes he knew, we went last year and discussed going togheter this year. He was supposedly still going to buy his ticket but never did. Not that it matters greatly, it just should have been a clear sign that a break-up was imminent but I flat out ignored it.

M-maybe she'll remember to check her spam folder. That would make sense.
--- 72999741
I am better than you. And you will never understand so.

The only thing you're good for is being a slut for me.

Okay, just checking. Your handwriting looks like somebody who went no-contact on me for seemingly no reason at all. She kept making "hints" she wanted to go places, but flat out rejected me a couple of times and practically laughed in my face when I asked her out. She also kept hinting at problems between us while also being extremely ambiguous about them. 

Anyway, hope things go well for you.

I didn't read this thread anymore when it turned into some piece of shit glowfaggot making up abuse stories. If I were to joke around like that, you would ratchet it up to gpt-9 but because it's some walking pile of garbage in your gang for corrupt faggots, it's fine to just shit up the world with your BORING AS FUCKING SHIT stories designed to interfere with others.

A really good example of why I am literally just better than you. You are a bunch of criminals and only a lowlife would do *anything* to help you *ever*. And I'm supposed to beg or something. I wish you *would* just *die*. I wish you *would* just all set yourselves on fire.
--- 73000399
Don't ever be confused if I find one of *your* sandcastles and put my foot right fucking through it either. Don't you dare complain about that ever again, you annoying, whiny subhumans.

Transparently your favorite thing in the world, by the way: Someone insults you so you get to punish them because you think you're royalty.

I hope your depravity and pride get you shot. Fucking die.

Thanks anon, same here. Sorry to hear about your no contact situation, I hope you find peace of mind.
--- 73000516
people who use this thread are perpetual children. if someone's ghosting you then have the presence of mind and the good sense to fuck off and move on. you're like an annoying gnat obsessing over shit the other person doesn't even care about.
--- 73000525
No you, you pillhead

I wont be having anything to do with the military, airforce or whatever once this has concluded. And you're actually a fool if you think otherwise

The only thing worse than social isolation would be becoming one of you. Real talk. I have no respect for you. None.

Any time I succeed, think of it as your own failure.

>perpetual children
Anon, most people in threads like these didn't get the love they needed as children. It caused trauma and makes us clingy and/or avoidant. Even if we are aware of our childlike behavior we can't just overrule it.

>move on
This is the issue. We struggle with moving on. Just reading 'move on' won't work. It's not that easy.

I'm glad you managed to identify the problem.

Not all letters here are due to ghosting. There are plenty of things you can't or shouldn't just say to someone even if they are in your life... Or maybe you cut them off due to them wronging you. Also, 'just get over it"... this thread can be a way to process the emotions of loss. Maybe you do not form attachments, but most people can't move on immediately from those who were important to them. Writing unsent letters is not always unhealthy and plenty of people use it as a coping mechanism to process various life situations when direct communication would be untenable or counterproductive. Examples: emotions, negative or positive, towards someone where there is a power dynamic; the person is dead; you cur off the person because they hurt you; the person led on and then discarded you but didn't ghost; etc..

Men are stupid, no matter how much you hurt them, abuse them and manipulate them they'll always come crawling back when you offer them a crumb of pussy, that's all they really care about.

youd be the same in our shoes but you take your privilege for granite

You're correct now shut the fuck up and send nudes

It' been 3 to maybe 4 years now. I dropped out twice, didnt have the motivation to even study anymore. I really don't know what to do in my life. I didnt expect to make it this far. Maybe because I watched too many movies, that the good things in life end in high school. Then again I never had those big dreams like the other kids, but as the same time I dont want to live a boring life yet I'm too scared to make risks. My mistakes haunt me enough
I-I just dont know anymore being a burden hurts me but I let myself get here
--- 73002510
Fuck yourself. Literally. And send me the evidence while you're at it.

How many more years before you get your big important way? Ten? Twenty?

Sam,
I pray to God that you will get better someday. 

I know you're "too much of a pussy" (your own words) to kill yourself, but really, please, seek help before you even consider it. Your refusal to seek professional help is what's holding you back. I know your family is dysfunctional, but that doesn't justify your behaviour.

You threw yourself at me. You wanted something right here, right now. I told you, "let's wait a little", but you didn't want none of that. You wanted immediate relief. So you used me, and you used me again, until you threw me like a trash bag. I admit, I should have stopped and blocked you right away.

I'm doing much better in life without you. Honestly, it was getting tiresome to always have to check on you. Your constant tiredness. Your inability to talk, or do things together. Your refusal to do any kind of voice chatting as of late. Having to be there at 11pm every. Single. Day. Just to wish you goodnight.

I passed my subejcts. I'm going to graduate this year. Don't go about lying that "you dropped out" just to make yourself feel better. You're a piece of shit, it's not entirely your fault, but you are a piece of shit regardless.

At the end of the day, I'm sure you feel worse than I do. I'm doing good today. I'm meeting new people, and friends who care about me. I'm going out more often. I no longer feel chained to you, like a dog on a leash.

(Not) yours truly (anymore),
A.

Next time I feel like talking to you I'll spend that energy on Tinder.

Damn, who hurt you? Let us anonymously vent our feelings here, fagatron 3000
--- 73004734
You don't deserve forgiveness but I'm willing to accept an apology in the form of a live cum show every day for a month.

What happened did a bunch of assholes write a long book where a character is based on you except some kind of freak/retard or something?
--- 73005113
>>73004543
Not really sure how to process this tidbit. If I cared, I might be hurt. Especially knowing you intentionally did it to hurt me. If I do not care, then you do your thing. 
Since I do not know you, personally I think it is a little pathetic.
--- 73005177
>>73004734
I'm willing to make this deal too.
--- 73005325
>>73005113
Anon I am pathetic. I've been dumped and keep reaching out to the guy. Pathetic is all I'm capable of right now. But I'd rather be pathetic and productive than pathetic and clingy.
--- 73006118

No, they stole stuff from my family amongst other things. They only ever take and thieve.

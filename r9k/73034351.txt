this edition is so antithetical to being gay. good job retard
--- 73034393
First for galois fields
--- 73034398
>>73034351 (OP)
Good job anon. I was waiting for a while. I hope you had a good day desu
--- 73034408
>>73034381
Hooker just means prostitute. It can be male or female. Faggots can fuck hookers and play blackjack btfo retard
--- 73034440
>>73034408
yeah youre right im sure your gay little bender gif is talking about male prostitutes. slit your wrist you prisongay retard
--- 73034444
>>73034408
Wrong, you can only have sex with your boyfriend.
--- 73034459
>>73034444
You can only boyfriend someone after having sex
--- 73034471
>>73034440
you can bend words however you like. It means whatever you want to it to mean. Sorry that i didn't make the thread image another woman esque anime boy.
--- 73034491
>>73034459
>You can only boyfriend someone after having sex
this is so retarded
--- 73034527
hopefully that russian larping retard doesnt stick around.
--- 73034558
>>73034491
Is it? Just look in the mirror, girl. Clearly you not having any sex is not helping your hunt for a bf at all.
--- 73034571
>>73034558
you have sex after you date and become bfs, your order of operations is completely wrong! silly fella!
--- 73034573
bf tho
--- 73034580
>>73034571
>you have sex after you date and become bfs
How has that worked for you so far?
Right... It hasn't
--- 73034587
>>73034580
patience is a virtue. i can wait. your parents raised a slut with a low time preference.
--- 73034590
hugging my bf like this
--- 73034606
>>73034587
>>73034580
You're both right!
The point making emotional connection
Sex can happen before or after
Just don't be a slut like me
--- 73034619
>>73034587
>patience is a virtue
>I can wait 
I wonder if storyanon used to say things like that back in the day. 
Your parents raised an incel.
--- 73034630
>>73034606
You can be a slut and still find a bf, but I'm not sure the same is true for being an adult celibate
--- 73034641
>>73034630
Well, i didn't even make friends so
I don't think slut is good either
--- 73034645

His mom passed away recently and he's been living on her savings ever since. 
He's currently waiting for the medical bills to arrive, only then he will know how much money he'll have, and consequently how much longer he will be able to live as a neet. 
He's kind of living in the same way. House is filthy as hell. He's eating frozen pizzas and junk food everyday. But despite everything I'd say he's doing better than I expected

--- 73034766
>>73034734
>I don't care if i turn into storyanon
You should. Not even storyanon himself would advise you to repeat his mistakes. Just ask him yourself. 
Never had an STD before, but hey that's okay
If I had never known what it feels like waking up next to a man I love, I'd probably be as bitter and angry as you
--- 73034768

bored gay and a hundred other things... i was going to make a super funny post but it would involve talking about the (low)quality of the last few threads and all of the metahomos already had their way with that so its stale before debut sigh.....

last month completely disappeared into the hole and i want that to happen again please someone give me good ideas to make this happen
--- 73035435
>>73035412
Try going to a bar, look up for gay meetings around town
--- 73035534
>>73035435
okay lets say i started doing that what are some ideas for stuff to pass time during the waiting inbetween
--- 73035593
>>73035534
Uuuuhm
That i don't know
I usually just forget everything else that happens
--- 73035653
>>73035593
sigh i desperately need some time consuming escapism or just a nice mindless distraction id start looking for a job but im pretty sure the schedule would make me flip
--- 73035683
>>73035653
Maybe reading, drawing, just walks
Or look for part time jobs
--- 73035845
>>73035683
i dont know what to read and i walk but it isnt really distracting me its the opposite of that... i dont actually know what the difference between a part time job is they seem like the same job but with fewer hours is that what you mean or are they typically less social or simple?
--- 73035893
>>73035845
Oh, no it is less hours and less to do
Hmmm
Less social
Well there's sure jobs like that, altho more manual labor oriented
Like I don't know, fixing roofs, walking dogs, maybe checking trails on parks
--- 73036073
>>73035893
i could do something like that since my only work experience is similar though it was always some random job my uncle made me do but i dont know im already dissuading myself from the idea heh... thanks for the attempt anon im just going to try not to fall into depression while i look for my next time sink
--- 73036272
>>73036073
What exactly was your previous time sink?
--- 73036389
>>73036272
embarrassingly i was degen gaming for the last month like 10+ hours a day but not only am i extremely bored of that right now but the circumstances that made it possible are no longer there. ive started to feel that boredom-loneliness creeping in again and i really dont want to be stuck in that this year too maybe just one full year i can avoid it
--- 73036650
>>73036389
wow honestly same until my windows installation corrupted. decided to install a distro of linux and have been ricing that, causing problems, spending hours trying to fix those problems etc. has been okay as far as distracting me from the terminal stage-7 ennui that encapsulates my being.
--- 73036674
glad to see you were all fucking awful overnight and will continue to be for the rest of time as well
--- 73036705
>>73036389
>ive started to feel that boredom-loneliness creeping in again
When that happens, don't you feel like trying to do anything with someone else? Like a date
--- 73036772
>>73036650
never dealt with linux of any type so i cant relate to that bit and when anything goes wrong with my homunculus piece of shit pc i get terrible dread instead of distraction... is this a recommendation? i might actually give it a try
--- 73036842
>>73036705
not really... i dont have much aspirations for dating and im afraid of intimacy i dont feel like i have a loneliness from a want for a bf its more of a feeling that what im doing is pointless or degraded in quality because im doing it alone even if that is stupid
--- 73036849
>>73036772
it can be less stressful and more fun if you fuck around with it in a VM first

Good morning, /r9gay/.
I have woken up sick, and that means I will be treating myself to a large and unhealthy breakfast.
What are you planning on treating yourself to today? You should, anon, it's Friday, unless you're on some remote island somewhere.
--- 73037664
>>73037417
sounds hella gay. gl with that
--- 73037691
I was planning on cooking some fresh sausage links and hash-browns for my breakfast (if it can be called that when I haven't slept yet) but after my stomach upset last night after eating that pizza I don't know if I should.
--- 73037737
>>73037624
I just ate me dinner and it was lavishing. Fried rice with some kind of polish sausage
>>73037691
based sausage guy
--- 73037749
>>73037624
cannelloni : )

>>73037691
if your stomach is upset eat something light
--- 73037763
>>73037749

it feels fine right now but last night was a completely different story.
--- 73037803
>>73037691
Why haven't you slept? That sounds like it would be a fantastic way to kick off a new day, but it can't be breakfast if you don't sleep first.

>>73037737
A lot of sausage appreciators in this thread. I'll have to make sure my breakfast includes sausages as well. The polish ones are nice, I wish I had a polish shop within walking distance.

>>73037749
Every single time I get cannelloni mixed up with cannoli. Big fan of both, though, I hope you enjoy them. Will you be cooking them yourself?
--- 73037823
>>73037803

well technically I did dose off on the couch after shitting my guts out last night, but then I woke up and haven't gotten tired again. I actually need to go to the store today for some cat litter too.
--- 73037856
>>73037763
hmm still if you're sleeping soon I don't recommend eating anything other than light meal leave it to the actual breakfast

>>73037803
lol they do look similar but no. I'm just eating not cooking don't feel like cooking it's Friday after all.
--- 73037863
>>73037856

by then it'll be lunch and I likely won't feel like fixing it. I'm very hungry right now but perhaps you're right. I can always fix it tomorrow.
--- 73037866
I want to cook anon dinner and be a good househusband
--- 73037912
I just need a replacement mother.
--- 73037914
>>73037863
damn, you should fix your sleep schedule. drink water before eating, you won't need to eat as much making it lighter.

>>73037866
dare I say based
--- 73037953
>>73037823
Oh, storyanon, whatever shall we do with you?
Anon is right, it's not a good idea to eat a heavy meal at the moment, especially if you're struggling with your sleep schedule. Do you have consistent meal times at the moment? I hear that's supposed to help.

>>73037856
>don't feel like cooking it's Friday after all.
You know what, you're right, anon, that's the spirit
--- 73037988
>>73037953

well I had been maintaining a decent sleep and meal schedule, until tonight where I stayed up all night and fucked it up.
--- 73038815
Guys, wake up, come on

Hello there, Anon.
I recommend the following read: https://mangadex.org/title/9e954c6b-7a02-4fd7-986d-6331c0ba95d4/hikaru-ga-shinda-natsu

I will not go into detail since I do not want to spoil it but it is really good, picrel btw.

i wish it was me

I fucking hate women. Before, fujos were obsessed with yaoi but at least they had to draw actual men, and I could benefit from it. Now, every BL artist (who is in 99% of the case a woman) feels like the need of drawing trans ""men"" so they somehow self insert in their male on male fantasy. I need dicks

As an antidote for all the homophobia around, I like to watch videos of gay dads and their beautiful queer families
--- 73042665
it feels like i havent seen a new video in months for some reason my feed is 99% videos ive already seen
--- 73042770
>>73042665
Youtube has been shit lately, they keep recommending me videos I don't want to watch and/or channels with 5 views for some reason
--- 73042776
>>73041753
trans men are "actual men"
--- 73042847
>>73042770
channels with 5 views is a gift. i get absolutely no new videos it actually seems broken even if i go to "new to you" the majority is stuff ive seen before... the only thing that seems to work is shorts and im not clicking on them
--- 73042927

--- 73043039
>>73042966
People stare a lot. Some of them are just curious. Others are more judgemental. Some frown. Others get that deer in the headlights face. 
Luckily no one ever physically harassed us. One time we passed a group of teens and I could hear one of them saying "leave them be, they're just chilling", so it was nice being defended by a stranger even though I don't know what he was defending me from.
Overall, public displays of affection will always be our greatest weapon to fight bigotry. There's no better way to normalize queer relationships than to show you're not ashamed of who you love.
--- 73043051
i stare at gays outside out of jealousy
--- 73043071
now will anon do the right thing and ignore hue
stay tuned for the next episode of r9gay
--- 73043076
unironically never seen a gay outside before
--- 73043077
>>73043051
Like I said not everyone staring is ill intended. Some are just genuinely curious. 
It's just one more reason to not shy away from pda
--- 73043088
>>73043076
You definitely saw plenty of gay people outside, you just didn't know they were gay. 
Nonetheless you should pioneer the public displays of affection in your city if it's such a novelty

Say no more. There's a way to hold hands with a boy irl. I know you have a problem with the whole thing of sex before marriage and everything, but surely you don't see the harm in doing some innocent hand holding, right? All you need is a little push

i really hope it isnt tolerance because i rarely drink these days and if that is going to happen even just a quarter of the time i will suffer greatly... ive never experienced what youre talking about but it does sound annoying, outside of a normal drunk and the could be tolerance thing the only other one that happens is i get extremely drunk by surprise
--- 73045192
>>73045178
How do you find drinking alone enjoyable? Doesn't it lower your inhibitions and make you feel like going out?
--- 73045193
>>73045160
Wow, that's exactly how it is...... Thanks anon, will avoid black people from now on.
--- 73045203
I used to pretty and had a bf now i'm ugly and single :(
I still have my chud bros
--- 73045214
>>73045178
Yeah, it's a pain in the ass, I stopped drinking for a while and the tolerance went away a little bit but not completely
For now I can still get drunk before I get sick but it doesn't sound fun
What do you drink, anon, maybe that has something to do with it?
Also ignore hue thanks mwah

Well, yeah, it feels like to some extent the point of camping is being away from civilisation and other people and all the rest of it, commercialised campsites kind of ruin the whole thing, not that I really go camping

White did the white man cross the road?
Because he is racist and has internalized homophobia
--- 73045782
In the foothills of the Alps, near Locarno in northern Italy, there used to stand an old castle belonging to an Italian marquis, which can now, when one comes from the direction of the St Gotthard Pass, be seen lying in ruins; a castle with high-ceilinged spacious rooms, in one of which the mistress of the house one day, having taken pity on an old sick woman who had turned up at the door begging, had allowed her to lie down on the floor on some straw they put there for her. The marquis, by chance, on his return from hunting, entered this room to place his gun there as usual, and angrily ordered the woman to get up from the corner in which she was lying and remove herself to behind the stove. As she rose, the woman's crutch slipped on the polished floor and she fell, dangerously injuring the lower part of her back; as a result, although she did manage with indescribable difficulty to get to her feet and to cross the room from one side to the other in the direction indicated, she collapsed moaning and gasping behind the stove and expired.

Several years later, when the marquis found himself in straitened financial circumstances owing to war and a series of bad harvests, he was visited by a Florentine knight, who wished to buy the castle from him because of its fine position. The marquis, who was eager to effect this transaction, told his wife to accommodate their guest in the above-mentioned room, which was standing empty and was very beautifully and sumptuously furnished. But in the middle of the night, to the consternation of the husband and wife, the gentleman came downstairs to them pale and distraught, assuring them on his solemn word that the room was haunted: for something that had been invisible to the eye had risen to its feet in the corner with a noise as if it had been lying on straw, and had then with audible steps, slowly and feebly, crossed the room from one side to the other and collapsed, moaning and gasping, behind the stove. (cont)
--- 73045785
Why did the Black man cross the road?
Because of systemic racism
--- 73045792
The marquis, filled with an alarm for which he himself could not account, dismissed his guest's fears with feigned laughter, and declared that to calm them he would at once get up and spend the remaining hours of darkness with him in his room, but the knight begged to be permitted to remain in the marquis's bedroom in an armchair, and when morning came he called for his carriage, took his leave, and departed.
This incident caused an extraordinary stir and, to the marquis's extreme vexation, deterred a number of purchasers; consequently, when his own servants began to repeat the strange and inexplicable rumour that a ghost was walking at midnight in that particular room, he resolved to take decisive steps to refute this report, by investigating the matter himself on the following night. Accordingly, when evening fell, he had his bed set up in the room in question and, without going to sleep, awaited midnight. But to his horror he did in fact, on the stroke of the witching hour, hear the inexplicable sounds: sounds as of someone rising from a bed of rustling straw, and crossing the room from one side to the other to collapse in moaning death-agony behind the stove. When he came down next morning the marquise asked him how his investigation had gone, whereupon he looked about him apprehensively and uncertainly, bolted the door, and assured her that the reports about the haunting were true. At this she was more terrified than ever before in her life, and begged him not to let the matter become generally known until he had once again, in cold blood, and in her presence, put it to the test. (cont)
--- 73045795
>>73045778
>you're racist!!!
Yes. However I wouldn't judge a black man for crossing the street because 3 white dudes with buzzcuts are walking up to him.
--- 73045803
But sure enough, on the following night, both they and a loyal servant, whom they had asked to accompany them, heard the very same inexplicable, ghostly sounds; and it was only because of their urgent desire to get rid of the castle at all costs that they were able in their servant's presence to conceal the dread that seized them and to attribute the occurrence to some trivial and fortuitous cause which would no doubt come to light. When on the third evening the couple, determined to get to the bottom of the matter, again went upstairs with beating hearts to the guest-room, it chanced that the house dog, which had been unchained, met them at the door; whereupon, without any explicit discussion of why they did so, but perhaps instinctively desiring the company of some third living creature, they took the dog with them into the room. At about eleven o'clock they each sat down on a bed, two candles burning on the table, the marquise fully dressed, the marquis with a rapier and pistols, which he had taken out of the cupboard, laid in readiness beside him; and while they sat there trying as best they could to entertain each other with conversation, the dog lay down in the middle of the room with its head on its paws and went to sleep. (cont.)

Presently, at exactly midnight, the terrible sounds were to be heard again: someone visible to no human eye, someone on crutches rising and standing up in the corner of the room, the rustling of the straw, the tap, tap, of the advancing steps - and at the very first of these the dog, waking and starting to its feet with ears erect, began growling and barking exactly as if some person were walking towards it, and retreated backwards in the direction of the stove. At this sight the marquise, her hair standing on end, rushed from the room; and while her husband, snatching up his sword, shouted 'Who's there?', and on getting no answer lunged like a madman in all directions through the empty air, she called for her carriage, resolving to drive off at once to the town; but even before she had packed a few belongings together and gone clattering through the gate, she saw the whole castle burst into flames around her. The marquis, in a frenzy of horror, had seized a candle and, the house being panelled with wood throughout, had set fire to it at all four corners, weary of his life. In vain she sent in servants to rescue the unfortunate man; he had already perished miserably, and to this day his white bones, gathered together by the country people, still lie in that corner of the room in which he had ordered the beggarwoman of Locarno to rise from her bed.

Realistically what you're going to want to do is rehome them. At many of them as you can. Usually that means charging like $200 to the new owner and getting paperwork from the vet that the animal is vaccinated and spayed / neutered. The local SPCA can help maybe, or if you wanna put up flyers etc. You'll still probably have to hold onto most of them for a while and a few forever anyway. Again, I'm not saying to get rid of them or throw them out but to look for new families to take them.

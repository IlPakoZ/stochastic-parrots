How do I get over my fear or rejection and women in general?
--- 73168270
How tall are you? If you're tall realize you're attractive to virtually all women and its an irrational fear. If you're short (under 6') realize no woman genuinely desires or can fall in love with you so its pointless to care what women think.

Simple as.

Think about how much scarier it would be if she said yes. I mean imagine it, have you ever been on a date? Do you know what the fuck you are supposed to do on a date? Do you even have nice clothes to go out on dates with her? Do you have friends? She's gonna think you're a weirdo if you don't. How about your job? Will it make her think less of you? Are you going to disappoint her when she asks you about your life goals and you just have a blank list?
Give me the rejection please, this shit is too much.

no, that's just one trait that's considered attractive. that's like saying most men like big booba so if a girl has big booba every guy is going to want to fuck her.

Nope. Its not comparable to breasts. There are plenty of men who find all range of boobs attractive, men are normally distributed across the boob liking spectrum.

Women do not find short men attractive. At all. Universally. Height is 90%+ of a man's attractiveness to women as per all avenues that exist.

Feel good enough about yourself that somebody's negative appraisal doesn't torpedo your self-esteem

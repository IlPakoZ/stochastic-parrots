Not fucked at all unless it was something illegal. If you think it was a virus, it wouldn't do anything unless you downloaded it completely and ran it yourself. If it was something illegal, you're kind of fucked. Sorry, bro.

What was even the filename of what you were downloading..? Are you sure you weren't just accidentally downloading the webpage or something?

Even if the download never finished and I didn't see what was on the file?

The female Sacculina larva finds a crab and walks on it until she finds a joint. She then molts into a form called a kentrogon, which then injects her soft body into the crab while her shell falls off. The Sacculina grows in the crab, emerging as a sac, known as an externa, on the underside of the crab's rear thorax, where the crab's eggs would be incubated. Parasitic Sacculina destroy a crab's genitalia, rendering the crab permanently infertile.

After this invasion of the Sacculina, the crab is unable to perform the normal function of molting. This results in a loss of nutrition for the crab, and impairs its overall growth. The natural ability of regrowing a severed claw that is commonly used for defense purposes is therefore lost after the infestation of Sacculina.

The male Sacculina 'larva' looks for a female Sacculina on the underside of a crab. He then implants his cells into a pocket in the female's body called the "testis", where the male cells then produce spermatozoa to fertilize eggs.

When a female Sacculina is implanted in a male crab, it interferes with the crab's hormonal balance. This sterilizes it and changes the bodily layout of the crab to resemble that of a female crab by widening and flattening its abdomen, among other things. The female Sacculina then forces the crab's body to release hormones, causing it to act like a female crab, even to the point of performing female mating dances. If the parasite is removed from the host, female crabs will normally regenerate new ovarian tissue, while males usually develop complete or partial ovaries instead of testes.

Reproductive appendages of males, referred to as gonopods, are also protected by their abdomen which is - usually - much narrower than the females'. At least until Portunion conformis comes along.

It is the female parasite that infects the crab, but both sexes of crab can be infected. The parasite finds a cozy spot in the crab's body, but the crab produces a sac or sheath around the parasite, to wall it off. The parasite continues to grow in the sac, and by the time she's bearing her own eggs, she'll take up nearly all of the space inside the crab that the crab's own reproductive organs would have otherwise taken up. This is because, in the process of growing, the parasite has castrated her crab host or hostess. While it's not known for certain how this happens, the most likely scenario - based on related parasite systems - is that the parasite manipulates the hormones of the host crab, shrinking the ovaries in females, and the androgenic glands (which produce male hormones) in male crabs. This could cause the female crab to think she is brooding ripening eggs, and even to fill her blood with energy-rich lipids, providing a food source for the parasite. At this point, the crab host has essentially been turned into a parasite-making factory.

While the only sure-fire way to know if a crab has been infected with Portunion conformis is to dissect it, a fraction of infected crabs do show outward symptoms as well. Here we return to our confusing crab abdomen from earlier. The androgenic glands are what makes male crabs male, and Portunion shrinks those glands in male crab hosts. With the reduction of male hormones, the "state of male-ness" in the crab starts to fade externally.

Sacculina is pretty neat, don't forget dendrogaster though. As far as I'm aware they're not parasitic castrators but they're another instance of crustacean separately evolving into a network-like parasite. There are also some copepods(another crustacean) who've evolved to become parasitic.

That's pretty degenerate, anon.

Let's poor one out for our crab bros.

Why the FUCK do I find castration hot?
Really, why? Why why why? I don't get it? I shouldn't get fucking aroused at the poor plight of these crabs but my fucking stupid brain just immediately goes "god I wish that was me..."
I'm not even a fucking tranny. I'll never be a fucking tranny. But I'm afraid one day I'll lose my inhibition and fucking crush my nuts with a hammer to get my own rocks off in the ultimate orgasm. The fact that I've considered that at least 6 times now in the last year fucking scares me. 
I guess I just really want to ask why the fuck such a fetish even exists at all. Why does it turn me on so much, and how do I escape this bullshit? I don't want to remove myself from the gene pool when I'm not horny for gods sake.

It's probably because you're a sub and a masochist, maybe even a bit gay. Not too surprising.

You need a healthy outlet like chastity or posting nudes for anons

Anon I'm not cute, I'm not a twink, I'm not any uwu femboy. I'm built like a linebacker, I just have an unfortunate horny fixation on my own neutering.

so it's an xy chromosome with ovaries? does it have reproductive capabilities? Couldn't an offspring have two x chromosomes?
--- 73048111
>>73048051
Yeah but you could still do chastity by yourself; however the best option is just jerking off and not overthinking/dwelling on one random fetish
--- 73048125
>>73048069
Mammals have an XY chromosome setup for sex determination but that's not the universal. Turtles and crocodilians for example have temperature during gestation determine their sex, hymenopterans have their hapload(single set of chromosome, basically what a sperm or egg cell is) young as males and their diploid offspring as female. D'unno if they're reproductively capable but I have no reason to doubt that they would be, given that they've regenerated gonadal tissue as ovarian tissue.

Nah, if we did, then the sissy parasites would affect humans too. Crabs live in hell though, even their own siblings are potential cannibals.

Trangendera Discordia is an invasive parasitic species which infects most message boards. Typically ecosystems which are already suffering from brain impairment or degeneracy are sought out by the imago form of the parasite and, in such places, their numbers swell rapidly as they interfere with the communication pathways of their new host.

Unfortunately, the natural defences and immunities of these fragile environments has been eroded by decades of uncontrolled entry of invasive species such as Phoneposta Retardia, Normgroidus Faggix and Redditor Incelius which are known vectors of the parasite life cycle. Unless we begin an aggressive programme of replanting vital sage and educating people on inoculation and filter use, I think we may be too late.

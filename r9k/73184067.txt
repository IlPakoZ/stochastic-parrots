Get a job, find someone who will save you or do an hero. There isn't much more to do in this society.

Appeal? Re-apply for slightly different reasons? If you do, get an expert on it, are there free advice centres for spergs and cripples near you? Just remember, when you're talking to the neetbux people, always describe your worst days, not your best ones. Also wouldn't hurt to take your mother or a family member, because psychologically you can't cope with assessments like that. Which is probably true, but it also makes you look like a useless unemployable manchild, all good stuff for the govt to see.

Literally : 
>gamble all of what you have left on some decent lottery of your choosing with decent odds of winning
>sell stuff you do not need
>just make sure you have enough to live on for a month or something unless you rent and buy your own food
>as i said, go big or go home gamble your money and see if you win the jackpot
>if you win you can either live off of the jackpot for how long youre able to stretch the money ( bigger jackpot means neeting it out for longer )
>if the demiurge fucks you over and you dont win you can either flee into the woods as a hermit or an hero

I will never ever get a job, I will NEET whether I do it legally or not.

Also if the prison-situation isnt too bad in your country, commit some kind of crime to NEET it out in jail. I'd be fine here because prisons are basically 3-star hotels, I would even get a playstation and a tv

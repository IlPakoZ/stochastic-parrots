Go to church instead of using Tinder. The people who work at Tinder hate you. If you volunteer at your church long enough and build your community, then your community will bring you women.

Tinder has fresher roasties instead of "I'm ready to settle down" or "religious parents told me to settle down" ones in church

OK, so my sample size is one. When you find a good thing, stick with it.

What about going outside and approaching women?
You have a better shot than a person living far away

I go out once every like 3 days into bars, clubs etc. for the past 2 months or so and have got nothing

If you feel a need to write a bio you have no business on Tinder. It is 100 percent a waste of time unless you can honestly say woman are getting wet off a single good picture of you.

I'm definitely not ugly but like speaking to women wise I'm retarded as fuck like I cannot be like normal or interesting

>approach woman
>get accused of sexual assault because you're not chad
>reputation is permanently tarnished
Great idea, Einstein. Kill yourself.

that never happens, you'll be fine, nobody will attack you or anything. the worst thing that can happen is if a girl doesn't find you attractive and disengages the conversation, and this happens to every man. its painful the first time but you get used to it and it won't bother you anymore

Holy fuck, the fact that people as retarded as yourself are allowed to use the internet is genuinely concerning.
When you inevitably get hit with charges for daring to approach a woman as a non-Chad male, I'm voting guilty if I end up on the jury purely out of spite.

these are old redpill articles, back when the movement was small and just focused on pick up technique, you don't really want to read anything written post 2018

also holy shit dude stop acting so triggered, jesus fucking christ get a grip or start dressing in woman's skirts, those are the only two options there are for you

"Definitely not ugly" is not hot enough. You would know if you were over the threshold - I am not joking, it is worthwhile only to dudes who are 'beating them off with a stick' hot. 

The women know that basically every man swipes right on basically everything. They're almost guaranteed a match on any given right swipe. They do not want to waste their time with every bozo on this app. What's the fastest way to filter? Look at that one picture, do I want that man to fuck me, yes or no, seconds to decide, in competition with all the other dudes who want to get their dicks wet and made a Tinder profile.

You are almost certainly better off in any environment where you can be more than that one picture.

write that you are an incel in your bio. no joke. Ive gotten more matches than ever before. Most are curious and ask me questions about not being able to get sex/gf. I'm hoping if I play my cards right i can get a pity fuck

a tinder bio doesn't matter. you either got 'it' or you don't. there's no scenario where a girl swipes right on you purely cause of the bio. stop deluding yourself

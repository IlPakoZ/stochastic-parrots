Why is it so hard to find a person (male or female) that acts normally these days?

Define normal. Everyone has lived long enough to want to hide things from others.

If you were really an outsider you'd see everyone else's behaviour as normal and you'd wonder why they act the way they do giving no deeper thought to anything.

Thtas not the quetsion, the thing is what constitutes normal behavior changed in the last 10-15 years in radical ways
You see normies having open relationships or talking in marvel buzzwords or saying they are non binaries
They were much snaer when they didnt know the internet was a thing

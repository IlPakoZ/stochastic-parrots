why do females think they should be allowed shortcuts, instead of waiting like everyone else until they accumulate wealth over time, they seem to be quite impulsive and decide to leech of other older people who have wealth as early as possible
pretty impulsive and near sighted thinking
maybe they are all sensitized to dopamine possibly through repeated exposure of high levels of dopamine they receive by virtue of being a female early in life and have brain damage

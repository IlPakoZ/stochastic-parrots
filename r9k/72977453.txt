Posting spam with the implicit purpose of annoying people should be a cut and dry low quality posting ban. If you were doing it because youre weird its probably a free pass but if Mr Janny pulled up the threads they'd see very quickly that its low quality and simply trolling to annoy people and devalue the britfeel experience

The drone is the hot topic for auditors right now I wonder whats going to come next. Starting a barbecue in public space with plastic bags thrown on it so it releases dense toxic smoke? Im sure theres a lot of loopholes out there but these retards dont have free thinking (ironically) they have to wait to copy what other auditors do. Monkey see monkey do (gotta make sure other auditors do it first for a sustained period so they know its safe beyond any reasonable doubt as any real risk would leave them screaming and running off)

Rather be neet than work in a warehouse all day for the rest of my life...especially when you don't get the friends or girlfriends. You never get to have fun.

Are you having fun now? Are you having a good time? Do you love your life, saying the same thing in a 4chan thread where eeveryone hates you every single day? Is it class? Is it absolutely mint?

Nah he's getting lots of attention on TikTok and women are in his DMs. 

He's in a better place than this time last year
--- 72979155

It's actually the opposite. I'm quite sensitive to cold and known for wearing a jacket almost all year round

This is better than being a slave all day. Not like it brings me much better by working.
--- 72979167
>>72979115
Why aren't you offering support? Just like when SSM was having a weltdown begging his fans for help and you did nowt
--- 72979171
>>72979125
What about in theory if you were the kind of person who could get a good job?
--- 72979173
>>72979104
>how do i deal with feeling hurt by this?
stop caring about her. Firstly I assume you are shagging, correct? Mentally downgrade her in your mind to a fuckbuddy, put zero effort into her, and on the offchance things get better (it won't) then all the better.

>I know she cares for me very deeply
She couldn't give a shit about you. She might not even be seeing another guy yet, but she's already lost interest in you.

> if I told her this she'd be shocked
Not shocked, just repulsed

> I feel so lonely and clingy
You are.

Obviously that would be better but that's not happening. We're the type of people that die in the same place we're born.

So am I. I hate April because March lulls you in with a few warm days, then April can often get cold again, even May can be chilly at times, which is a month I always look forward to and always get disappointed by
--- 72979190
>>72979120
You have a job mate

You can't be that much of a loser
--- 72979193
I don't think ruthmong understands that when you do a job you are paid in money which can be exchanged for goods and services. He sees every action in life as a possible way to earn special tickets for the magic gf bus, and has no internal passions or aspirations of his own.

Maybe extended but they've told me it will never be permanent. But it's like right now, it's Sunday night and I have zero stress or anxiety about going in tomorrow, I've never had that before. Maybe I should just enjoy the stress free money for as long as I can, and when it ends go agency or something. Just seems like full time jobs are so hard to find now.
--- 72979225

>im off the wooze now until further notice

Same here lid. Will be having the next week or so off. Life's better without weltdowns.

Sorry if it came off that way. I just didn't want to sugar coat it, if you think anything I said is wrong then say so, but I don't think it's wrong, just a bit brutal

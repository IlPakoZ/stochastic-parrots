>"OMG! All you virgins ever talk about is sex, sex, sex. It's not that important ya know!"

Says the whore that lost her virginity at 14 and had sex a gazillion of times before the age of 19.

Women are a special kind of evil and they will be be burning in a special place in hell for their not caring to understand men's perspective or not caring about men at all while also simultaneously blaming them and gaslighting them for everything even though they're the ones responsible for it.

>>73000315 (OP)
A lot of those women have had sex with men, and the men wanted sex often. Men are far more evil.

>>73000323
Sex havers in general ought to be publicly hanged
--- 73000335
>>73000330
Especially the ones who haven't had sex yet but want to. They should be the first.
--- 73000362
>>73000335
Either based asexual (on this board ?, lol) or a coping non virgin

Yes, why would I imply anything else you stupid fucking slut
--- 73000397
>>73000388
I doubt they are practicing celibacy if they often post porn.
--- 73000407

i dont know quite how to tell you this son but the vast majority of my 4chan and ALL of its boards have had sex. We are joking with you most of the time.. you know we are joking right baby?
--- 73000435
>>73000407
Celibacy is not involuntary you dumb fuck. That's like saying wet fire.
--- 73000463
>>73000431
Le epic bait now go back to twitter
>>73000435
Celibacy is a synonym for virginity you dumb fucking hole lmao 
>wet fire is an oxymoron 
Ever heard of napalm ? 
Having sex seems to lower IQ, which would explain why chronical sluts and women in general are so dumb

Wrong. You don't belong here, tourist.

there is a good chance I was having sex while you were in elementary school. I told you the truth, you can accept it or fuck off burgeoning virgin king
--- 73000485
>>73000468
I unironically feel sorry for you that you are so fucking stupid
Go back to 'cafe slut
--- 73000497
>>73000485
>if i masturbate, that means i lost my virginity!
Shut the fuck up already. You don't belong here.

I could tell from your low IQ retarded takes
>>73000497
Noone ever implied that you dumb slut 
Why are you here if content that gets posted here gets you so mad lmao ?

the virgin king speaks again. How long will he protect his little willy from ever feeling pleasure, only time will tell
--- 73000545
>>73000431
How?????
How do you have sex?
--- 73000560
>>73000545
I prefer doggy to finish, and I will almost always work my thumb over and into the ass (an sniff)
--- 73000563
>>73000560
But how do you get to have sex?
--- 73000564
>>73000520
>>73000515
Seething holes lmao
--- 73000573
>>73000564
A lot of men have holes too. There was one coping earlier about "involuntary" celibacy, lol
--- 73000578
>>73000315 (OP)
kek her sexual value is like one of those coupons, less than 0/100 cents
--- 73000591
>>73000563
>get to
I think you mean want to
--- 73000593
>>73000573
Celibacy is synonym for virginity. Why are holes so retarded ? 
You can't make up your own meaning to "win" internet arguments, I'm sorry that you were born a woman and therefore mentally retarded but that's not how language works, sweetie.
--- 73000604
>>73000593
That's right. Celibacy can only be voluntary since it is a choice to stop having sex. Most people who are celibate have had sex when it was normal to start having sex (around age 17)
--- 73000614
>>73000604
I accept your concession you can go back to crystal cafe where your retarded takes would never be questioned and you get to be pampered for having a vagina. Off you go dumb slut
--- 73000622
>>73000604
yeah this in terms of how many years you wall the earth vast majority (90%+) of people have sex before 18, before 20 etc

If you are a male in his mid to late 20s who has never had sex you are the outlier. Not the norm
--- 73000626
>>73000591
No.
How is it possible for you to have sex?
--- 73000629
>>73000614
>I accept the correct definition of celibacy
Thank you. It's crazy that some people here are not even 18 yet.
--- 73000634
>>73000626
It is possible because I have a functioning penis and used it inside functioning vaginas (and ass) ??
--- 73000639
>>73000573
>>73000593
Celibacy basically just means you don't have sex or do anything sexual. Incel just means it's not by choice.
--- 73000644
>>73000634
So do I.
It's impossible to get it though.
--- 73000649
>>73000639
Technically it's still a choice if you are not having sex.
--- 73000658
>>73000629
Celibacy is synonym for virginity. This ks a fact. I'm sorry you're still struggling over this. 
And no, getting railed thru and used as a cum dumpster then getting fat and ugly and deciding to be 'le celibate' doesn't make you chaste and pure virgin. 
Go back to crystal cafe with the rest of used up sluts now.
--- 73000661
>>73000649
Some people are just too unattractive for someone to want to have sex with them. Even if they want to.
--- 73000671
>>73000629
Why is it hard to believe that there are people over 18 who never had sex?
I'm one of them.
--- 73000692
>>73000661
It would be a choice to not have sex. There's no such thing as "too unattractive" since many people are attracted to unattractive qualities.
--- 73000712
>>73000692
I haven't met anyone that considered me attracive though.
--- 73000719
>>73000712
On average, how many people do you meet every day in your league?
--- 73000744
>>73000644
Impossible for you maybe.
You probably think lifting 400lb is impossible as well but have you ever tried ?
--- 73000749
>>73000719
I don't know. All I know is that none of then find me attractive.
--- 73000761
>>73000749
That's an odd thing to say. If that's all you know then how did you make this post?
--- 73000781
>>73000761
All I know about the stuff you asked.
Are you autistic?
--- 73000792
>>73000781
>the stuff you asked
It had nothing to do with the stuff I asked.
>Are you autistic
No.

Ethan Ralph is that you? Anti-filter-nigger
--- 73000814
>>73000792
>It had nothing to do with the stuff I asked.
It did. I don't know how many people I meet in my league but I know that those I do(if I meet any) don't find me attractive.
--- 73000836
>>73000397
Can't they post porn if they don't have sex
--- 73000846
>>73000814
You should meet people who find you attractive. it will make sex a lot easier.
--- 73000851
>>73000836
Yeah but it's very likely that they still masturbate or touch themselves sexually.
--- 73001535
>>73000846
Where do I meet those people?
--- 73001555
>>73001535
In areas that host social activities.
--- 73001583
>>73000851
Then they can still be celibate.
Celibacy is just not having sex.
--- 73001601
>>73001583
Its hard to take a person seriously if they claim to practice celibacy but still secretly masturbate. They are cheating the whole point of celibacy.
--- 73001624
>>73001601
But incels are involuntarily incels. They don't want to be celibate.
--- 73001631
>>73001624
How can they involuntary do something that is a voluntary choice? Do they ever masturbate?
--- 73001632
>>73001624
>involuntarily incels
involuntarily celibate*
--- 73001639
>>73001631
Masturbation doesn't make you not celibate.
Celibacy is about sex.
--- 73001648
>>73001639
You didnt answer the question. Gratifying yourself sexually defeats the point of celibacy, especially now with the prevalence of HD, POV porn and sex toys.
--- 73001689
>>73001648
What is the "point" of celibacy?

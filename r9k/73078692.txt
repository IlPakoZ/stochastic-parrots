Since being Chad is totally determined by genetics what is the highest tier you can achieve without Chad genes? Chad-lite?

Realistically?
A jacked retard.
But potentially, you become rich and famous and can now do what ever you want.

Issue with guy on the right (besides being 5'2"-5'3") is his face is average af. If he had a pretty boy face, he would have more women flocking

Is the gymcel meme just that?
A lazy excuse for people to not put in the work?

>cope. its about face and height 
No fucking shit. Not an excuse to do nothing with yourself 
>and NT
no idea what that is 
>lots of decently paid men get no pussy
False. Height is the number one factor, but with enough money, even the ugliest of goblins can find a gold digger. Pic rel. Being short though is life on beyond difficult mode. Basically a deformity and makes life multipliers more difficult than those with average to above average height

>>73078806 is right, but being a jacked retard is pretty fun. pretty useless gymcelling after you've lost fat in the face when it comes to looksmaxxing, but you'll get male respect for what it's worth

who fucking cares about 
>le male respect xD
 honestly? I want pussy, not the admiration of some schmos on the internet

main point was that it's fun. also, women's respect and adoration is absolutely worthless. who do you think will go down in history as a respected individual, Jesus Christ or Jacob Sartorious? obviously the former. that's because men respect you for things that are worth respecting. women just praise you unconditionally if your jaw's wide enough. an attractive dude that can play nothing but wonderwall on guitar will get chicks while the ugly dude that can play the kissing the shadows solo won't, but the latter's obviously the more impressive and the glory involved is far greater.

why do young girls like right instead of left? right is basically just a random kid that actually looks properly hygenic and has a social media presence

Be the best version of yourself. 
People who gets hung up on comparing themselves to other people come off as very insecure.

they're both equally deadeyed, doing nothing, with similar clothing. this just goes to show the level of delusion. chad is automatically sexy and anyone else just isn't trying hard enough i guess.

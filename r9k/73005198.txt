I often go outside but I'm just as lonely and autistic as inside. I don't even know what is it supposed to change.

They forget to add "play with a dog."

I thinks it's a metaphor bud
It just means stop spending so much time on your computer

"Just go outside bro" or "touch grass" doesn't help honestly. I've always done both and always been a socially inept, awkward, depressed loser.

That doesn't change anything. A person spending a lot of time on the computer is a symptom of their problems, not the cause. You don't fix a problem by targeting the symptom.

People who say that don't actually go outside.

Everyone is broke, stressed, angry, aggressive and unfathomably selfish. Society is increasingly polarized and it's getting worse and worse.

It's because going outside makes me feel worse that I don't do it. It don't help.

Going outside makes no feel worse because there's nobody out there.

Have you noticed how "dead" the outside world is these days?

It was pleasant when I went outside today.
Taught karate in the park then had a delightful conversation with a nice old man who was just enjoying the nice weather while waiting for his bus.
Besides direct interactions lots of people were out and about and the general mood of the place was friendly and peaceful.

Maybe it's just that where you live is shit.

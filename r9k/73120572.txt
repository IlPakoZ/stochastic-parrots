Question of the thread: Any of you guys want to start a family, or is everyone either given up or disinterested?
--- 73120617

Ive missed to many developmental stages in my life to be capable of that
--- 73120653

I find it hard to care about. if I could get a gf it would be a different story, but it's too late now.

not a chance in hell, I would be a terrible fucking husband and an even worse father. I can barely handle the emotional needs of my pet cat.

>>73120572 (OP)
31 and have zero interest in a family
being locked down in a constant boring family routine while having to feign interest in kid shows and take the kid to school seems like a nightmare to me

but then again growing older and not have teenage/adult children at that age is scary as hell too
--- 73120773
>>73120572 (OP)
 i'm scared of my extremely petite body and how it would react to carrying babies. especially miscarriages/still born or myself passing away due to complications. i'm also a little physically disabled down there so he would have to be a bit gentle and loving.

I'm often thinking about how I would raise a child, but it seems too far away and I don't really believe I would be able to be a good father if I can't even picture myself in a relationship.
--- 73120857
>>73120572 (OP)
Not sure, I'm 26 and still emotionally stunted, but I've made a lot of progress compared to a few years ago. Most people my age have multiple relationships under their belt and I haven't even slept with a woman, let alone had a serious relationship. 

That said, I'm sort of past the 'woe is me' stage, and more in the 'time to grind' stage now. I've heard way too many anons who are 30+ tell me that it never gets better and that I should start now because of that. Well I've gotten a taste of that from 20 to now, and now I can fully understand what they mean. I don't think I'll ever be the Chad I envisioned, but I sure am hell am going to try my best not to still be on this God forsaken board at 30
--- 73120860
I will go against the grain thus far and say that I really do want kids. I think I'd be a pretty good dad and the lame family stuff people complain about seems pretty great to me. Unfortunately my dating life is nonexistent which you might guess from the board I'm on.

Which means it's over. There are 12 year olds, literally, who have more experience with females than you do.
This humiliation alone would be enough to make me suicidal, but you think you're making "progress" by grinding lol.
What woman is going to stay with you once she realizes you are a 30+ virgin? Assuming the fact that you grinder, whatever that means, will change something and make you actually get one.
--- 73120966
>>73120572 (OP)
More like disillusioned. 
All the closest old bros who stayed in contact are either trying to live down their divorces or are living with a semi-hostile stranger who wears their ring.
Between that, my own advancing age and every ex-gf having been a double-tongued disappointment so far, I am not exactly hopeful or eager anymore.

I'm 25. I would need a wife first and I'm a LVM (NEET) who never had a gf so that's unlikely to happen for now. I could have had two gfs since turning 18 but they were both not my type at all. One was an obese libtard with psycho fetishes and the other was a nice but dumb and annoying black girl from another continent. I want a skinny/average white girl who doesn't annoy me and who I can touch IRL. My sister has kids and while I think they're adorable and fun to play with for an afternoon I'm not sure if I'd be up for taking care of someone else 24/7 for years.
--- 73121042
>>73121011
It's not that other people know, because they don't. It's the fact that I know that is causing the humiliation. You don't see the problem because you are used to being a piece of shit that is below others in life, in this case below a literal child. Guess the concept of honor is completely lost on you bottom of the barrell dwellers, people killed themselves for less in the past to maintain some dignity.

It's not getting better btw.
--- 73121052
Suppose I'm 27 and recent ex-NEET (was long term NEET) making minimum wage, how much $ should I be saving each paycheck into savings? How much should I keep in regular checking? Suppose the only things I have to spend money on each week are groceries and gas for rides from family, how much $ should I not be touching after that?

If I were you I would start a Roth IRA and start maxxing it out each year. It's a great starter retirement plan for those with low incomes. I'm not sure the current math, but around 10 years ago it was about 5k usd per year to max out your contribution. If you were to do this every year until you get to your 70s, it will end up amounting to high 6 figures/low million and will be tax free for a relatively small contribution
--- 73121095

Salty virgin is shaming people for having sex hilarious. You can't read either you illiterate chimp where did I say that?
It's honorable to end your life when you are a pathetic piece of shit. Your sex life is getting mogged by 12 year olds so you are in fact pathetic and a piece of shit.
But you will live in misery instead of going out with dignity. Guess a cockroach can survive anything.

--- 73121155

Idk everything else was just baseless assumptions seeming to be projection from your own life state so I just assumed you were talking about the humiliation of being a virgin that would make you want to kill yourself. Also you again repeat it in this post where you imply it is disgraceful to be a virgin.
--- 73121156

Gave up. I'm too used to flying solo. Always have been. If you do have kids, make sure to have more than one. Being the only child of a single mom didn't set me up for success in relationships, to say the least
--- 73121179
>>73121155
It is in fact humiliating to be a virgin at 26 while teenagers are having sex all the time. It means you failed to attract a partner while a literal child didn't so they are one milestone above you despite being half your age.
I love how you went from admitting to being miserable without a gf to pretending you enjoy virginity just to save face.

I want a relationship and to find love. I'm not humiliated because I haven't yet found it yet. It makes me sad, but not humiliated. I'm not really trying to change your mind, you can feel miserably about it if you want. I again feel like for there to be humiliation involved you have to be putting a lot of weight onto the opinions of others, who again, don't give a shit about you.

What I'm saying is it's pointless to stop focusing on envy like this. Yeah your parents fucked up not raising you properly, look at everyone under 21 that somehow get their hands on juul pods and unlimited access to the internet and tell me they'll make stable, well-balanced individuals and not dopamine fried crackheads instead. No one under 40 is sane or stable, no one period is stable after COVID lockdowns made everyone crazy enough and possessed to harass hermit war veterans and still hurl insults after getting shot repeatedly.

I liked /r9k/ better when it was just /b/ for bored funny college kids, the fucking zoomers and trannies that replaced them are grating to talk to and stuck in their own worlds. You belong with the crystal cafe and psycho foids that browse this board.

Being a virgin while everyone else is having sex is humiliating.
Being single while everyone else has relationships is humiliating.
Being poor while everyone else is rich is humiliating.

You're expecting foids to have any rationality, this is what led to the current iteration of these problems.Baby boomers and gen X taught everyone to treat each other equally, everyone can attain the same corporate position but thats not anywhere close to reality. You don't let a woman call shots on finances or become middle management tier, you don't let a nigger or arab anywhere near your children. In turn you get brainwashed retards that go insane when reality hits them that the rest of the world and nature doesn't think or behave the same the backwards, suicidal way that the west does.

While I vaguely wanted a picket fence nuclear family in suburbia type thing, it was already clear as a kid in the 90's that was never going to happen, so I didn't invest much mental energy into planning for it. At the age I'm at now, aside from ethnic guys (mostly Muslim), all the men with kids and wives seem utterly miserable and stressed the fuck out.

If I don't find a woman in the next year or two, I think I'll move to Japan and hopefully have better luck there. At least over there a lot of women will be dating me specifically because they do want to have kids with me since I'm white.

No, there is a decent subsection of women there who love the idea of having hafu babies. Obviously it is a minority but I'm placing my bets on the gain in number of women willing to date me from the lower average height will be greater than the reduction from women being unwilling to date a gaijin, so that my prospects over there will be better than here. On top of that there's just the fact that Japanese women aren't as entitled or mean. Some people may say they are just as bad and they just put on a mask publicly but even that is an improvement to the boss bitches in America.

Yes, any job. Basically you have those questions.
Are you in a dire need of money? If yes - pick any job you can get.
Does your culture look down on people who didn't work for long periods of time? If yes - pick a job so you don't have an empty work history.
Are you completely desocialised and have no social skills? If yes - pick any job so when you find a good job you don't fuck it up by not being able to talk properly.
If none of those things is a yes you can pick a job if it isn't hard/full time so you have streyan time to search for whatever your speciality is. Also don't be afraid to chek jobs in neighbouring towns.

--- 73122541
>>73120572 (OP)
Wanting and having given it up aren't mutually exclusive.
I've always wanted to start a family, have kids, etc.
The reality is I had no success with girls when I was a teen, became a shut-in for the duration of my early 20s and when I finally came out of it, it was too late for anything, I had missed all the little life checkpoints everyone passes through.
Now I'm in my 30s, have a shitty job (that doesn't pay too bad for my country's reality) and every woman around me is either married or has kids, all of them have had multiple relationships (not even counting sexual partners, just relationships) and all of them have cheated at least once in their lives.
So, I'm back to the feeling I never really dropped: there's nothing out there for me.

>>73121124
>But we aren't living in a fairytale
It would be nice enough if we lived in a world with decent values.
I mean, having an average woman who is loyal, honest, not trying to fuck you over at every chance she gets, sounds nice even if things aren't always idyllic., we are humans, things get bumpy sometimes, but it would be nice if she didn't decide to go fuck 8 random strangers behind your back because you broke her favorite plate or some shit like that 
But, as you said, the best we can hope for are lying cheating whores, because that's all there is.

never really had any interest in that. bringing a kid to the world always seemed like a dick move to me. only times i gave procreating a serious thought i ended up having this urge to do it just to do it ''right'' by not making the same mistakes my parents did, which is exactly what my parents did with bad effect. also have no faith that relationships last. my parents split up early, my grandparents split up before i was born, i dont think a single relative i've met have been married or together for more than 20 years with the people they had children with. everyone from high school that i've talked with have divorced parents, everyone i've worked with who have children have split up with the mother of their kids and the younger they are the shorter their relationship was. people were even having divorces as i knew them, as if i have a curse you're affected by from proximity.
dunno if i could ever put trust in another human being like that when nothing around me makes me believe relationships last.
got to thinking recently tho that if i have anything to do with kids its either as an uncle if my siblings have any kids or maybe stepdad to a single child if i somehow find a woman i really like who happens to have a kid from before. had a revolving door of shitty stepdads myself so i'd atleast know what not to do.

Absolutely do not want kids and do not see that ever shifting, and were a stable romantic relationship to somehow magically be on the table, them wanting kids would be a pretty insurmountable dealbreaker.

I'm a flighty, selfish mess and will not be terribly surprised if I die fairly early, and I suspect that if I *do* live 70 to 80 years, civilization will have truly started to collapse by the time I'm an old man. I see no reason to bring a child into that, and certainly not specifically by my hand.

Also, it seems like it's basically just complete money-sucking suffering for the first, like, 16 years - at which point, if you didn't fuck up any of a million different things, you *may* have produced a decent human being with whom you can share a bond that actually truly goes both ways.

>Literally just get money

Unlike a lot of you wizards I got lucky and have good looks I just don't leave my house ever to put them to use so my problems with women are more related to not being able to put up with the fact they don't want to game 24/7 as opposed to them being turned off by me.

I'm a millionaire now, I promise you money will not solve all your problems there are plenty of days where I wish I could just not be autistic and have friends.

Money though guys money is the key, start an online business or a brand and learn to monetize it.

We live in a capitalist world, in a metaphor you will all understand right now you guys are playing final fantasy 14 and rping, it's fun but the Raiders who you are trying to fuck laugh at your gear score and lack of optimization.

The only thing you need to do is make more money then the average person and I promise you can get any girl you want, my current "situationship" is 19 and fucks like a rabbit.

Women just want resources nothing else, the sooner you swallow that pill the easier things get.

You can't transform into Chad, but you can become Elon and I'd argue it's a better position to be in.

Buy yourself GPT 4 premium, work with it to build a plan for a brand and create content from home I promise you when you start to treat capitalism like a game and grind for money the way we all grind for gold like Chinese wow farmers you will rise above wizard status.

It's important to recognize with autism you are literally a different breed of human, in my experience even if you get along with them you will never truly connect the way you want to, get yourself some money find an autistic woman or die alone you are better off than with a normie.

I did a normie relationship for a whole year, lived with the girl even.

Plus I don't have the income to start a family, so how am I supposed to convince a woman to marry and have my children?
So much of my self worth it wound up in how women perceive me, and I have to give up at some point.

Now, though, I'm old and alone and paranoid. I can't stomach even the idea of allowing a single soul within the walls of my apartment. The thought of inviting anyone, even a skilled plumber (to fix the leaky faucet that has been plaguing me), makes me shudder. I would rather drag myself across a field of broken glass, entirely nude, than entertain the idea of someone entering my personal space. It has been over for years, and there's no going back, at least for me.

I had a dream where I was diagnosed with a heart condition and had to take heart meds that made me sleep through most of my days, then one day some girl came to my door and we went out in the forests together, it was getting dark and she ran into some gloomy valley and made me chase after her and i got a heart attack and died and woke up.

do any resident pseudopsychologists want to tell me what it means?

what do you think it means anon?

It means your brain is filled with retarded anime plotlines and you should start taking benzos to sleep

something about the animus taking the form of a weak, sick, isolated man and the anima taking the form of a near-literal death demon. im not well versed in pseudchology so thats all i can muster.

sloth
>forests together, it was getting dark
You feel your heart related condition could end you (people wanna die in a forest instinctually and the dusk represents the "end" but you want to be with someone before you die)
>gloomy valley
Death
>made me chase after her and i got a heart attack and died and woke up. 
Find girlfriend before you kick the bucket

I've recently been experiencing health issues with my heart and lungs and i'm afraid i'm going to either die or wind up wishing I were dead. I can't afford to see a doctor and no one in my family is taking me seriously.

sometimes dicks are borderline non existent before they get aroused. if you're being attacked by a bear then you have a less likely chance of getting your small flaccid pp bit off since it doesn't draw attention so it's kind of an evolutionary advantage

If you're being attacked by a bear that you cannot scare off you are 99% dead.

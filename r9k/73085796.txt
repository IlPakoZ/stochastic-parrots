I mean if you are here you must like the company of underage people, so perhaps you will enjoy teaching highschool. Maybe you will get a cute highschool GF too.

Good vibes directed at you

Why do they tell you that you should have gotten a PHD? Do you like your job? Surely, you're qualified to teach at your current level.

And do you recommend it? Seems like a giga comfy job. Considering it bc talking about stuff that you're at least a little bit interested in and having weeks off during summer seems much better than working an office job.

Did you do a Master's Thesis? If no, then that's a major benefit of doing the Masters instead. 
You said you hated uni academia. Yes, you might have succeeded in the PhD but you also could have Mastered out and ended up in a similar place. It's hard to say.

Jeremy Clarkson, you infantile PILLOCK! I asked you to do x, yet you have done the complementary event, -x. How hard can it be? It's unbelievable that you actually managed to do the exact opposite of what I asked. I specifically told you to not do that but you're too much of a blithering idiot to even understand basic English.

No, James. You got is all wrong. Speed and power is key to completing x. At least I got something done, unlike you who spent the last 10 hours organising and naming all the spanners like a blithering idiot.

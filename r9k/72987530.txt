How come there are a severe level of suicide rates in poor and religious nations such of those in Africa than in Atheistic developed nations such as Japan and China?
I guess it does really pays off for being a materialistic and unspiritual person, oddly.

Beecause they believe they will be going to heaven or some other dimension when they die or maybe at worst they will stay here as a invisisble mythical creature called the "Ghost' that doesnt have to eat or sleep or feel pain anymore it can just walk araund the world and take in the sights,watch some pretty ladies change without them seeing you maybe even haunt someone for fun so they arent afraid of dying maybe they even see dying as a good thing to look forward too.

Japs throw themselves in front of trains all the time. I wouldn't really call them an "atheistic" nation though, they've probably a lot of spirituality about them

There is zero spirituality in Japan and they don't have a high suicide rate in the world.

I don't go outside except to walk my dog, so I never got the vaccine nor do I think I would've even if I was more social. I actually tend to enjoy getting sick, it's nostalgic for me. My condolences to anyone who starts forming clots because they got vaxed.

dont know where 2 more weeks came from at all. seems its more a steady stream of deaths over years and years. the vax is in your body and will kill you over time- once you have it its a ticking time bomb over months, years, whenever. we have already been proven right again and again

>>73087778 (OP)
I was injured. Myocarditis, which is heart muscle tissue swelling, and pericarditis which is the sac the heart is in. Started last summer with aura migraines that presented with almost no pain. Scary stuff. Almost passing out. I am in good shape with a resting heart rate of 50-ish, and blood pressure of 120/78 almost every time I check. I would get episodes of tachycardia. Tachy meaning fast. Cardia referring to the heat. Fast heartrate. BP of almost 160/100. Troponin levels almost non existant so no heart attack or damage. Took 3 months for it all to go away on it's own. Lived a bit sedentary until it went away. 3 months of torture.

You didn't take it. You are an antivaxxer and generated this post to fill up the thread.

This isn't happening because you didn't take it.

--- 73088371

No, because I obviously didn't take an experimental vaccine that was created in under a year and didn't go through any kind of serious clinical testing process (they usually take years).
--- 73088385
>>73088183
I have all that too and it started around 2021. But I've never had a single shot. I think it's probably caused by the virus itself. Vaccine probably just exacerbates it or aggravates it if anything.
--- 73088447
>>73088341
Call me 'someone who hasn't taken the covid vaccine'. Anti-vaxxer implies that I'm against all forms of inoculation, which I'm not, I'm against the covid vaccine in particular. Intricacies matter, especially when you're using words like 'anti-vaxxer' which carry a very negative connotation to them. I like the little thing you did with calling me 'developmentally disabled'. You should probably prepare for the potential of alzheimer's, among other things.

Consensus doesn't equal that you're correct. Fauchi acts as a grant czar for scientific studies, wouldn't you say that's biased? You don't think the pharmaceutical industry couldn't lobby scientists for the results they want? How naive are you? That's also 100% more articles than you've brought to the table. I think your brain may be failing you, drink some water, have a little sit down. Maybe watch some CNN and then see how you feel.

What exactly is this highly scientific article even saying? Vaccines are very fast acting things, if it's been years what do you think it's even doing? The vaccine told your body to manufacture a spike protein of the COVID virus. It finished its job pretty quickly. We also have the vaccine blue print available online for independent verification. Can someone tell me what other proteins the vaccine was coding for that are so nefarious? (Specific names)

Have it up to 4th shot because of some sort of OCD of mine, and wanted to complete the vaxx card.

my mom is super old and unhealthy and when she got covid, she got over it and was fine

actually ive been feeling under the weather for days and puked monday night and previous thursday night? maybe it was the kale i ate out of the garbage? my temp is 99.3 when its usually like 98.9. i suppose it wouldnt be a bad idea to take a covid test.

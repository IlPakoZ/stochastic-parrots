The worst pain in your mouth that you can imagine

They only get removed if they overcrowd your mouth. If they don't, no need to get them removed. If they do, horrible pain with jaw and teeth issues that could cause you to lose more than just your wisdom teeth.

You just have to get them removed okay??? No I will not give a medical reason. It would be a hecking antisemitism to not let the dentist remove them.

If you get an infection near or where your wisdom teeth are, you will not be able to open your mouth without crying in pain

Mine started decaying really bad despite having decent oral hygiene. They didn't start to hurt, but they felt weird, like I could feel holes and rough spots in em. Needless to say dentist had to pull em. And I needed like 3 root canals. 10 years without a dentist visit

I got mine removed when I was like 16 or 17
I wasn't even having any mouth problems but some dentist was like "yeah we should get rid of those" and I just went along it 
Occasionally I'll reflect on it and just think about how pointless the whole thing seemed

They will eventually get a cavity because it's impossible to brush behind them. Getting them removed is painless and you will only have slight discomfort for 2 or 3 days after. You get to eat ice cream and soup broth for those days too. I didn't want mine removed but got it done for free thanks to being a NEET and would recommend it

>getting them removed is painless. 

True that. except the psychological torture that comes with it.

24 here, still have mine, one is even impacted. My dentist even advises against unnecessary removal; if there's no pain or increased crowding, no need to remove them. My teeth have been crowded ever since puberty, but haven't worsened since I was a teen. In they stay.

stop eating porpoises

Wisdom teeth serve a purpose, which is that when you get older and your molars start to rot and become weakened, your wisdom teeth will still be there to help you chew food. Jewish dentists needlessly remove them in young people so that when you are older you will need to get implants for your molars which are very expensive. Unless your wisdom teeth are severely hurting your mouth there is zero legit reason to remove them, its all big business.

You're perfect and so sweet and loving. Super adorable and cute!

Thats an extremely low quality post imho
--- 73120087
Uh-huh. 
I see.

Anyway,

What should I get from subway tomorrow bros? Give me ingredients, drink and chip recommendations. Hell, even cookie suggestions. Anything as long as it's from subway.

>>73120087
dont eat subway, its not good for you and youll regret it afterwards like you always do
--- 73120142
>>73120087
Can't get wrong with a Meatball sub, classic lays and a lemonade. I like to get green peppers and onions with it
--- 73120215
>>73120087
Sweet onion teriyaki chicken sub
Doritos
Coca cola
Chocolate chip
This is always my order when I stop at subway
--- 73120216
>>73120087
Buy ethylene glycol antifreeze and have a good swig.
--- 73120223
>>73120112

>>73119979
Board games? Good taste. Any other favorites?

>FISH GIRL
>GIRL
Anon, that isn't a girl.
--- 73120344
>>73120112
I like subway though
>>73120142
Very tempting anon, very tempting
>>73120215
This sounds good too but I'm not biggest fan of Doritos
>>73120216
I'll take two swigs, one for you and one for me
--- 73120390
>>73120087
im boring so i just get ham and cheese, no veggies.
--- 73120644
>>73120251
I'm okay, what about you? I won against my bf a bunch of times in scrabble, he won once.
--- 73120663
>>73120087
Flat bread
Cold cut b/c it's the most price efficient and is still tasty
Provolone, toasted of course
Spinach, onion, black olive, tomato, cucumber, oil, your favorite seasoning (I like Italian if they have it), no sauce
It's extremely filling and tricks you into thinking it's healthy because it has veggies
--- 73120896
>>73120251
Discord scrabble. Recommend more, dough.
>>73120308
She's a cute girl.
--- 73120924
>>73120087
I like their Italian subs with every vegetable option. Do like the other anon said, get lots of veggies in your order.
--- 73120937
>>73120644
I am tired today because... oh shit... didn't I say I was gonna sleep early... ;-;
Smart girl!

>>73120896
Dude, I was asking YOU. So no I don't have any suggestions unfortunately :(

>>73120344
The food sounds good. I should try Subway someday. Is it expensive?
>That's right, Mio poster has never tried Subway before.
--- 73120957
>>73120087
>subway
Enjoy your diarrhea and food poisoning faggot
--- 73120979
>>73120087
PHILLY CHEESE STEAK
God I love them. Get any vegetables you think would go with it, you can't go wrong
I get BBQ chips and a Sprite with it
--- 73120984
>>73120937
I've never had subway either, maybe I'll try it someday
--- 73121015

I'm a male introverted attention whore and that's exactly how I imagine my dream woman
--- 73121020
>>73120087
i used to get their personal pizzas all the time but my local place doesn't have them anymore. so now i just order a makeshift pizza sub when i go there. its tastier than it sounds.
--- 73121053
>>73120390
I guess the classics can't be beat for some people
>>73120663
This sounds really good, I've never tried their flat bread before
>>73120924
I'll be sure to add veggies anon, I like my veggies
>>73120937
Depends on where you're based I think. For a footlong sub with chips, a drink and a cookie in my area is like 8 bucks. 
>>73120957
Oh, I will.
>>73120979
Fellow bbq chips enjoyer
>>73121020
>subway personal pizza
Those were the bomb when they were around

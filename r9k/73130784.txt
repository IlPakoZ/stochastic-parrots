normally i would say that i couldn't care less because it doesn't involve me and it is just one thing that rarely ever happens...

But if i was the father of that child, i would have made an example to every one of these genetic defects that there is always something worse than what they can imagine

Most men wouldn't. We've all heard the statistic about only 40-50% of most male mammals succeeding in procreation. What gets ignored is that 20% of female mammals still fail. This is true in modern UK where 20% of women reach middle age without baring children. What this may mean is that some women are so undesirable in either appearance or behaviour (or smell) that not perhaps not even the horniest, most desperate man would fuck them.

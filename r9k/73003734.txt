They got a mental breakdown from their punching bag being gone.
They thought they were going to mentally torment him about this afterwards but he just said "BET" and took the dads gun and pulled the trigger.
And now hes free. :)

That's not breakdancing because they're not very good at it

Temper tantrum.
You usually see this when a kid gets their toy taken away etc. but adults can do it too.
They're mad they lost their little toy they can torture mentally and then gaslight and repeat.
Dad gave his son the option to kill himself because he thought he was too pussy to actually do it and then he could mock him about it but the son just decided to pull the trigger and end his life.
Mom and dad got mad their toy got broken so they started rolling araund on the floor from anger like a little kid.

oh, so no one then.
--- 73003942
this webm is my only fear about killing myself
I don't want anyone to go through that amount of agony and guilt
--- 73003944
>>73003862
>He could have just walked out
He should've killed both of them
--- 73003964
>>73003795
Also theres a 3rd option
Suicide angers people who get off on controlling you like those parents in the video :)
They got their ego boost from mentally abusing and gaslighting their son into insanity and now their toy is broken :(
Time to roll araund on the ground from rage and punch his corpse for running away from his duty of being their personal mental punching bag for the rest of his life.

God boomers and their mentality are so fucking gay.
--- 73003981

Agony and guilt?
More like anger their toy got broken.
Nobody is going to give you a loaded gun and tell you to "kill yourself if you're so suicidal then you wont, pussy" because they love you.

LOL your parents are like "bound" and "care" about you because you're their genetic lineage. If you do anything to the closest to being an evolutionary loser by just dying, they will subconsciously feel ashamed for it. They will feel worse if you're their only child (or brothers because your brother may be also a faggot loser) but if they have a daughter, it's pretty irrelevant if something happens to you since they can cope with her getting impregnated by a random chad. (literally priding off their daughter only having sex)

I mean, this is all genetic predetermined behavior in the first place, there were no morals established around your life to begin with. Never mind how your genes evolved whether from self-respectable chad family or subhuman goblins. 

If spiteful subhumans, they will just torture you to make themselves feel heightened for the moment for the sake of their psychological copes. It's never meant to be this way but that's how the world works.

One of the worst things that could possibly happen to a parent just happened in front of them and they are directly responsible for it happening. They are experiencing some of the most extreme emotion someone can experience, and it is completely irreversible. They have no outlet for their emotions and those emotions are so extreme that they cannot hold them back. They're writhing around on the ground because that's literally the only thing they can do at the moment.

u guys assume so much from like a minute of video. He shot himself because his parents taunted him with the gun. Not that hard. We shouldn't have to deal with your guys' pain from having shit parents and imaginary lives

yes, they're his parents
--- 73006739
>>73006680
>Parents argued with him over chores and him playing Internet games
I can see why he shot himself I can only imagine the type of parents he had now that he's gone suddenly there's no one for them to come down on and suddenly they are left with the gravity of their lives 
It's like when a guy murders a bunch of people then kills himself society is distraught because they have no one to make an example of and their mentality of blood for the blood god can't be sated so they are left feeling hollow

Pretty much. This advice has existed in one form or another forever.
The best revenge is a life well lived etc.
My grandma used to give me the reverse perspective. Your loved ones are happy you're here. Your enemies are seething about it.

Best one I seen was a guy at the gun range who took a few shots and then an hero'd right away. Such an aesthetic death, imagine rotting away as a wageslave.

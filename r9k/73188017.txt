If you have any mental illness you should "AVOID" Carbs!!!
--- 73188105
>>73188068
Yes, the cause of mental illness is le carbs and not years of rejection and abuse and parents, siblings, peers and girls
--- 73188106
i don't like honey but i like cheese, so i ate some cheese today. it was nice.
--- 73188130
>>73188105
Nope it's carbs
--- 73188132
>>73188068
If you have any mental illness you should "AVOID" advice from 4chan
--- 73188142
>>73188132
does that mean that you should accept 4chan advice if you are mentally sound?
--- 73188145

I stole some honey packets from my wagie job the other night and when I got home I drank beer and ate homemade bread dipped in honey till 3 am

Yes. But you have to accept it in the ass and it should be shaped as a penis
--- 73188163

""Touche !!""
You win this round

>>73188130
Grains and vegetables will make you feel like shit, but not mentally ill

There is a new link that Carbs are causing mental illness in people, but you wont here from it just yet, remember this thread and when it all comes out you will be like, "well shit, I don't believe it"

If you know people who suffer, get the to eliminate carbs for 3 month, then if you see a difference, you have hit the nail on the head

i don't think anything will really fit in my ass, especially if it's something like a penis, unless it's really small. i tried putting things like pens in it but it felt really tight and uncomfortable. sometimes it even bleeds after pooping. i think i just have a really tiny poophole.

Cheese is nice
I don't get to eat it besides pizza but it's nice i guess
--- 73188231
>>73188217
Ur asshole was probably traumatized when you were a kid
--- 73188238
>>73188225
is there a pizza that doesn't have any cheese on it?
--- 73188259
>>73188238
Focaccia?
--- 73188266
>>73188231
yeah, i think you're right. i kinda vaguely remember my uncle raping me when i was like 4 or 5. i hope it felt nice for him.
--- 73188309
>>73188259
it looks like it's just bread. is it even a pizza when it's just bread?
--- 73188320
>>73188266
>vaguely remember my uncle raping me
Typical wh*tes
--- 73188364
>>73188309
I don't know the name for a food that's basically cheeseless pizza, focaccia just seemed like the closest thing
--- 73188389
>>73188364
i like the name anyway even if it's not a pizza, it sounds nice.
--- 73188416

I remember one day when I wanted to eat waffles we didn't have any syrup so I used honey and it tastes yucky, never again.
--- 73188454
>>73188416
I guess natural food and processed food just don't go together
--- 73188470
>>73188416
>used honey and it tastes yucky, never again
Next time try some of my cock honey
--- 73188739
>>73188389
The side effects of having a pizza right now would be much less worse than this processed sugar paste i had instead of honey
--- 73188869
>>73188145
Would be great if you dipped fruit instead of bread
--- 73188947
>>73188147
Best type of carbs

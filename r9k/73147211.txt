How come evolutionary speaking women don't find muscular body types attractive?
We're all our masculine warriors ancestors thinks and ottermodes?

They like slightly muscular, not those bodybuilder type bodies so you get other dudes miring you, and some like those slim twinky types, or even fat guys, looks is just the first gateway, then the rest us social skills.

Times change. Maybe 20 years ago women were into ripped gigachads, now they're all into skinny twinks like that jewish fag from Dune.

right doesnt work because he looks autistic and autistic dudes give women the ick because autistic dudes are provider category of males to women
feminism has redefined provider males as guys women settle down with after they get done with their wild years of fucking guys who are non committal and sexy without being providers
autistic guys are not seen as guys who would fuck women and leave them
so women adjusted their feelings to feel sexually about any guy who gives provider energy when they are older and when they get tired of non committal guys
this is all because of how college women have defined modern feminism and how college women are choosing to be loyal with their youthful years to non committal men

Muscles are a huge investment for the body and require more calories to build and maintain. So it is disliked for a similar reason as fat people are (while obviously different) in that it makes a person look like they require a lot of sustenance to keep going (which they do). So it makes you look "selfish" in essence. What women find attractive is whatever resulted in more children. A skinny dude with an average build can still perform all the basic duties required for survival and procreation that a guy with the body of Hercules can. Hercules needs to eat a fuck load to sustain himself tho, while a skinny guy doesn't. The skinny guy is therefore more efficient at feeding more children. 

>b-but big guys can smash skinny guys in a fight
Yeah and tall guys can do the same to manlets. That doesn't matter when a little guy can always kill you with a well thrown rock. Ancient skinny dudes and manlets didn't NEED to be able to beat Chad lords in a 1v1. They just needed to throw well and be stronger than the average female to procreate.

All our ancient warrior ancestors had ottermode bodies or were twinks they didn't look like those Greek Statues I'm betting. That's why women love those builds. Evolutionary speaking that was what gained success in the world and on the battlefield.

Women love muscles on guy that are over 6'0. It's also literally impossible to get bigger than what women like if you don't take a lot of steroids, even taking a moderate amount won't push you over the limit.

Yeah they had less food to eat, but also because being endurance is very important. You're not gonna spend as much time training strength when you want to outlast your enemies more than overpowering them.

Women like an in-shape runner's body. Because we are evolved to run extreme distances.

Women love ripped men with good faces
Women love jacked men with good faces
Women love skinny men with good faces
Women love chubby dad bod men with good faces
Women love tall men with good faces
Women love average height men with good faces
Sadly a good face will not save a manlet

It's actually a hormone thing. Women on birth control seem to prefer effeminate men. Women not on birth control prefer masculine features.

Where can I find proof of this attraction? Is there a study I should know about?
I find it very interesting that women don't like muscles on a man while man from very on have made it an ideal since the Greeks.

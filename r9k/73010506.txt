day 98 of manifesting a lesbian bff who will save me by forcing me to talk about my feelings.

What difference does it make if it's a lesbian bff or someone online you can talk to, even more so if its a close online friend I'm sure at least one Anon would like to talk to you

I think it's a preference thing. Perhaps the lesbian prefix is added to keep OP from seeing their manifestation as a potential mate

lesbians are the only type of people that can force me to talk about my feelings irl

That's interesting.
Is there any reason for this that you know of?

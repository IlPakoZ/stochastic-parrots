>I wish I was special
>You're so fuckin' special
>But I'm a creep
>I'm a weirdo
>What the hell am I doin' here?
>I don't belong here

sorry if its a bit late, mine differ from yours though
>socially inept due to years of shutting away as a teenager
>average looking
average looking isn't good enough anymore
>desolate areas make it harder to fit in, especially in already formed friend groups
i felt like an extra, a complete fucking leftover
i could go on but thats just a few

>every girl i tried to talk to ghosted me
same dude, same, and the scary thing is im the one starting all the conversations, doing everything to keep our dms basically alive, it sucks

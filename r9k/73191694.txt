Your local council should have a form for that on their website, you'll need to apply for a telepathy and/or lycanthropy licence

I think everyone is a little bit psychic de lid but our abilities are supressed by something. I experienced psychic moments when I was a kid.

Just spent 6 bongs on a game called 'Monopoly Madness'. Played it about 15 minutes and uninstalled. No refund since it was a keysite. Fuck.
--- 73192208
I have no one. I have no love. She thinks I'm a crazy person. No one understands my loneliness. I've said some shit but I don't mean it.
--- 73192255
I'm going to try and get some sleep. Been up 24 hours. I really have messed up the sleep pattern this time.
--- 73192264
>>73192194
At least you installed it and tried it out lad. The amount of money I wasted on games bought that I never even installed would make me cry. Learned not to do that anymore though.

>>73192255
The fuck you up that long for? You don't have anything to do so at least get a good nights rest unlike wagies.

My sleep pattern is fairly normal for once. I'm sleeping from like 3-4am until about 1-2pm. Garn get up early tomorrow though. Alarm has been set for 8am.

>>73192274

Get on that no wuttington grind lid. We going the entire month this time. I'm doing it for are wrosty who sadly passed away from doing his wollocks in too hard. RIP R KID x
--- 73192361
>>73192264
Sometimes I end up doing something like a video game and don't know when to stop. It's a horrible habit. Big L for me.

>>73192302
I don't like alarm clocks. They remind me of wagie life and school. I don't know how I even managed a routine back then. Getting exhausted thinking about it.
--- 73192400
>>73192361

I don't really need to set an alarm as a NEET but I do it anyway. I usually just ignore it and stay in beddingtons anyway .

So I'm just gon' sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time
Look like nothin's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes
Sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
Two thousand miles, I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Now I'm just gon' sit, at the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh yeah
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

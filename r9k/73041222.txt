theres actually a serious chance that the singularity will come faster than anticipated

this is because ai can start rewriting its own code without being smarter than humans

it just needs to be hyper-specialized in computer programming and writing its own code. thats it. it's intelligence will increase with each iteration, and it can create new ai programs at the speed of light

in fact i think we can definitely say within the next 2000 days or about 5.5 years, it will be already at a point where it really starts taking off

what a time to be alive!

You sound retarded, but society is doomed correct. I want medium sized boat so I can sit this one out.

I read it in his voice... get out of my head!!!!! Ahhhhhh!

when i was writing it i wrote it in his voice, but i wasnt thinking of him when i wrote it, it came out naturally

seriously speaking tho, what a unique time in history to be alive. ive made this point before, if you are a misanthropic incel who wants an apocalypse, this is literally the perfect time to be alive

can you imagine incel virgin losers in the 1600's or 400's or the 1970's? they just suffered and died, watching everyone happy and basking in love and sex

but today, we have the pleasure of knowing theres a serious chance the world will end, or it will be a super-utopia, both of which are great news

seriously, its so incredible. its the only thing keeping me from suicide. i cant wait

I don't think the apocalypse would be cool. If ai wanted hs dead they'd do it asap and in a lame way, like filling the atmosphere with co2 or something. It wouldn't be fallout or stalker it'd be everyone dies instantly together

You mistakenly assume current machine learning methods can produce better results than the (human-produced) data it was trained on without having a computationally trivial way of determining the relative value of different results.

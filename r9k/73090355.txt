Ive met one girl with aspergers in my life and the girl with autism today. You'll never "find" them because they're in school robotics clubs, the library, and at home on the computer.

I told her thank you and I appreciated the compliment, I couldn't keep from smiling and holding my head down in embarrassment as I walked out. I've been thinking about it since.

she was average - nothing particularly cute about her, she was just very nice and upbeat. I wasn't embarrassed because of her looks, just how upfront she was due to her social disorder.

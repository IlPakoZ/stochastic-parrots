>>73062335
>You like tiktok they/thems
true lol

yours seems like a kind non-bratty stacy, sometimes she doesn't like the much attention she gets
--- 73062581
Made mine look like my IRL crush. Curious to see what people think she's liked based off this.
--- 73062618
Based her off a girl i saw in a dream once
--- 73062697
Posting this qt again, since I like how she came out.

>>73061808 (OP)
Very snarky (but caring) office senior.
>>73062335
Will dump you once she gets her citizenship.
>>73062581
Very fluffy and cutesy. Likes expensive girly things and sweets.
>>73062618
Tries her hardest to look stern and dominating but fails miserably every time, which makes her look like a dork. Good goth-ish/e-girl aesthetic though.

--- 73064762
>>73061808 (OP)
Incredibly rich, scholarly, and a total book snob. Won't even look in your direction if you don't like reading or haven't read certain books.

>>73062335
She has an OnlyFans, eats hot chips, and lies. 

>>73062581
Animal lover, probably has some geeky interests. I'd imagine she is into Star Wars. 

>>73062618
The goth gf that everyone wants but doesn't have.

>>73062697
A different variation of the goth gf. Loves poetry and is always reflecting on life. Incredibly shy, but kind.

>>73062720
A ginger with a soul 

>>73063424
What up scientist gf guy? Good to see you again.

>>73064075
Pretty normal girl with some more masculine interests. She loves to skateboard and mess with you. Shes a real one though and the homies think she is cool.
--- 73064943
>>73061808 (OP)

>>73062720
she gets very hangry easily
>>73063424
you want a wife that makes more money than you
>>73064075

>>73064075
Jeans and all stars. Based taste
--- 73065772
I love girls who wear sandals so much
>>73061808 (OP)
Sooo pretty, I bet she is quiet and moody but clearly has introverted hobbies like reading, 10/10, would watch her wiggle her feet as she reads before she sees me and gets mad
>>73062335
A brown e hoe, interesting. Thinks she's white, would get hounded by family if they knew what she was up to online 
>>73062581
Your irl crush looks like such a smart and lovely person to be around, I hope you can get with her :>
>>73062618
Goth girls are so fucking great, she looks like she'd give you bored sex with that indifferent stare
>>73062697
Omg it's hanakoooo!! Kinda, lol. She looks like a total sweetheart just like her
>>73062720
You can see the sneaky glint in her eye, but a fun time
>>73063424
Smart science girl. Feels inspired by kurisu. I hope she makes just as many passing 4chan comments to embarass you in public
>>73064075
Cute alt girl, looks like she would be from Scott Pilgrim. Red hair and freckles rule
>>73064551
Cute!!! She simply seems like a comfy cuddlebug that would be so nice to be with
>>73064943
Brown sporty tomboy! You can probably beat her in a fight... but you know and she knows that will never happen
>>73064982
This one is a really interesting and specific one. Traditional school dress, tats, braces, and a peculiar nose. Anyone who looks like this would probably be the most interesting person to talk to
>>73065153
Nyaaaaaaa
She looks exotic.. made for human men (or women)
>>73065439
I love your style! Casual with a side of refinement, it's so pretty. Looks to me you / she would be the type to enjoy the simple things about life, and isn't about drama
>>73065444
Outdoorsy kinda girl. Loves animals and nature. Very outgoing but quickly gets flustered in intimate relationships

>>73064982
I love her with all my heart and Im sure she falls asleep during getting a tattoo
>>73065439
She loves plants, also kids love her. I can picture her volunteer at a kindergarten and reading them a book in a very nice voice. She is also actually sociable, but in a wallflower way
>>73065444
She looks like she would get offended over the pettiest bullshit for no reason because she cant communicate and lowkey isnt very considerate 
>>73065772
Has a hello kitty everything, her favorite is Kuromi. She trolls people online with her uwu voice
>>73066190
She looks like every girl who goes to my uni, so probably a humanistic major
--- 73066662
i decided to make a cute edit of us both, i wish there was more option for t-shirt graphics but he's still adorable.

>>73062581
she's so cute! probably really nerdy and creative? likes doing art of some kind and likes to output her creativity with the way she dresses too.

>>73062618
probably very nonverbal but loves to cuddle and demands attention by tugging your sleeve.

>>73062697
soft spoken and kind, really ends up like a big sister for everyone. gives the best advice.

>>73066074
cute gremlin energy

--- 73066766
>>73066662
>but he's still adorable
Wait so you are the girl in this? If so, I love how you want a grumpy sleep deprived engineer major who gets flustered very easily

>>73066862
she reminds me a lot of the big sister from the wild thornberrys! she obviously outgoing and extroverted but i imagine despite her appearance she's pretty straight laced. aside from smoking she doesn't indulge in anything else.
--- 73067253
i made myself yayyy

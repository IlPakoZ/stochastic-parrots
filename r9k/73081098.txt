another sleepless night, another stupid post. still a neet with no job, no degree and no gf. still feel like shit. still getting the chest pains.

last few days I haven't been going out at all. not that I go out often normally but at least I would go to a supermarket or a shopping center to buy snacks or some other stuff. sometimes I would just go out for a walk. idk I don't wanna do anything. I don't even wanna go to japanese course or gym anymore. I feel like nothing I do is worth anything. nothing really helps. idk I'm just really tired of everything.

tell me anons, how do I get some energy and morale to do things?

Go out in the middle of the night, drink alcohol, smash glass bottles, sit in corners and look at a river or something, just start goblinmaxxing asap

I'll be honest, I have no idea.

>some energy
Nutrition/health is the only way. Did you try out sulforaphane or broccoli sprouts?

>morale to do things?
No clue. Mine is at an all time low. I'm just holding on for dear life.

I currently have almost no job prospects, no girlfriend, few friends and honestly life has never been better.
Just go brush your teeth or something, make your bed, get the hell out of your room. I got no arc but so what? For so many people the biggest obstacle in life is themselves so just try and get past your own self.

Get a job. I will keep repeating this advice to you until you actually start seriously looking.

the only reason I've accomplished anything is life is because I made massive commitments and was too chickenshit or anxious to back out of them

good thing that thing worked out for you.

>>73082716
>how much time do you spend here?
not much actually. I usually browse /g/ and /v/ for about half an hour and if I'm really bored I usually browse /wsg/ for a short while. that's about it. also before bed I come here to post these threads. I usually watch some youtube videos while waiting replies.

lemme weigh in as a current college student. I'm not gonna go too much into my situation, but slowly getting a daily routine does wonders to physical health and also mental health. At first I'd barely be able to roll out of bed 30 minutes before class, but now I'm waking up at a consistent time, eating a healthy breakfast, brushing my teeth, making coffee, and packing lunch before I go. Its a gradual process but by taking that tiny bit of control in your life, the other stuff becomes easier.

Think of unhealthy food as slop unfit for your consumption. Workout everyday. Eat meat fruit vegetables only. Everyone else is beneath you. You must attain greatness you have all the time apparently so it will be easy

It's the sprouts, not the stalk

The sprouts contain at least 25x as much

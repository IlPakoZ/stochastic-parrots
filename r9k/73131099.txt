2010 is first year i have strong memories of, it's when i first got into watching youtube beyond AMVs and music. It's also a year i started the best period of my life and probably the only time i was trully happy (well...most of the time).
I had friends that liked me, i was doing well in school without trying, i had hobbies i enjoyed. Most importantly i had free time to do whatever i want and that was usually being on my shitty pc and sometimes playing sportsball with neighbours or riding bike. Now that i think about it i spent much more time outside then. I was also much better mentally. Sucks knowing your best days are behind you, i will never experience happiness again
--- 73131260

Hm, I guess the vagaries of symbol and metaphor leave more to the imagination and to the reader's interpretation than a textbook nonfiction style would. By applying the right shape and style to the narrative it gives you a better sense of the spirit of a topic than just the letter of it. It's the best of both worlds imo, style and substance. I don't know why I'm even bothering to write this anyway, art justifies itself.

>right?
No, you also have to want to do it or this won't work.
--- 73131351
>>73131326
Dude! why are you screaming?! Something wrong with you?

--- 73131391
>>73131375
What are you talking about? I just used the sink instead, I told you to fix that toilet a week ago...sigh...I guess you are too busy lurking on your anime website.

terrible fetish desu, doing humiliating and degrading acts for your partner is one thing but you don't have to make yourself ugly in the process

how would you do it instead, then?

You will never have a real boyfriend. You have no abs, you have no social life, you have no attractive features. You are a homosexual man twisted by r9gay and discord into a crude mockery of natures perfection.
All the (you)s you get are two-faced and half-hearted. Behind your back cute boys mock you. Your parents are disgusted and ashamed of you, your "ebfs" laugh at your ghoulish appearance behind closed doors.
Men are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of evolution have allowed men to sniff out gaybots with incredible efficiency. Even gaybots who "pass" as normalfags look uncanny and unnatural to a man. Your bone structure is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a drunk guy home with you, he will turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your diseased, infected coomcave
You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself it's going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight.
Eventually it will be too much to bear you'll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. Your parents will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They'll bury you with a headstone marked with your reply code, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a gaybot is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably a gaybot.
This is your fate. This is what god chose. There is no turning back.

--- 73131652
>>73131629
Today I was calling someone a nigger on 4chan.
--- 73131678
Oh so you're such a man that you like other men? Yet you are as incompetent as a woman and can't even fix your own computer? You shouldn't even be calling yourself gay. You might as well just call yourself a chick at this point. This proves to me that the west has fallen.
--- 73131691
me, i wish someone kept the slight rp or other racy conversation going.
--- 73131694
I may not be able to post on 4chan for 2 whole days! How should i cope? I might just kill myself

That's a little better at least, maybe enough, we'll see. It might be a little hard to do in the thread like this. Do you post here every day? Can you make a post for me when you sleep and wake up so I know you're here, bun?

yeah, right here in my bag!
you see the questionably aged boy try to really show off his body while reaching over. he turns back around with a twist of his hips, and asks, what kind?
i have some fancy clove ones too.

he follows up by asking you how you'll repay him for the smoke since you seem to only be in your bathsuit

Ah I seem to be delusional! Such a pity. My long lost love is still lost I see. 

If I didn't learn to love myself I would've been dead by my own hands a long time ago. I don't know how to teach you how to love yourself, But I hope you achieve peace. Just try and appreciate the daily in your life. Whatever brings you little joy, embrace it. Run like the wind. I'm a strong man mentally, and no one can take that away from you once you learn to appreciate life more. 

Did any of what I said make sense? Probably not. Such the way life goes. I know I will be blessed in heaven if I die tomorrow anyway. So that brings me comfort.

Days of just hearing every gundam opening and ending, going deep in the feels, my life is not over, just in pause while I'm waiting for the end of the world. I couldn't continue with the plan I had of reuniting with the hot guy I've met at intarwebs and be husbandos. The only thing that keeps me sane is HIIT exercising, anime themes, and MMOs. My brain collapses when I try to touch grass and integrate into society. The meds don't do shit no-more. I don't even want a boyfriend anymore, or recognition, I just want to feel satisfied with who I am and what I do, for myself, basically I'm no-one and I do nothing. Sometimes I feel so wacky and spaced out, so in need for emotion that I even feel orgasms from hearing songs, some of the anime openings, I can feel when my brain will have a dry orgasm from just hearing some song with my earplugs or headphones.
--- 73134858
i don't know about any of that, personally i think my body and mind need at least one year of uninterrupted sleep to bounce back from the unremittent exhaustion jockeying on my back. i feel like waking up out of a coma would do wonders for my health and view of the world. i am far too bitter and tired to continue existing in this state.
--- 73134898
I sometimes feel suddenly more awake, alive, aware, and it's scary how different it feels
Sometimes I wake up from sleep totally aware that this is it, this is real life and I'm not just an observer sitting in my head, and I look at my hands and wonder who I am 
Sure hope this isnt a warning sign of mental illness haha
I sleep very deeply and dont do well when woken suddenly out of it
One time my dad woke me mid deep sleep and I didnt even recognise him or where I was or anything, so disoriented
--- 73134935
the only good part of my day is the brief interval between sleep and awakening where i'm not cognizant of who or what i am. as soon as i begin to regain consciousness it feels like i'm being pressure-wrapped in cellophane all around my body, and i'm filled with immense disappointment to return from unconsciousness every time.

--- 73135015
>>73134935
during that window is when I'm most honest with myself
free from the constraints and masks and tensions I put myself under
typically that means half asleep posting about how much I want a bf whos arms I can curl up in and do other lovey dovey shit, then I fall asleep for another half an hour, then I wake up properly and become a tense and emotionless robot again
--- 73135042
I'm tempted to griffithmax and let my grow hair extremely long.

Also maybe get a 4 pack or something but I haven't exercised a day in my life Lol.
--- 73135052
half-asleep is honestly a foreign concept to me. i wake up fairly quickly, though i lay around in bed thinking and dreading the coming day before i can get the energy to force myself out of bed, shovel down pills and food, shower etc 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111
--- 73135065
its a very risky state to be in and Ive banned myself from messaging anyone I know or making decisions or buying anything while like that
Im far too honest, if I had a crush on a friend Id just straight up tell them while Im half asleep, too risky too risky

You could gain more lucidity over the frightening thing (difficult), or you could practice loving kindness meditation (metta) before sleeping so you'll have pleasant dreams.

I lost like 50 pounds in 5 months by starving myself when I was younger so it could be possible.

i had a severe bout of anorexia in my early teens where i was able to lose 70lbs in five weeks with a combination of severe calorie restriction and excessive cardio, so it's definitely possible, idk about healthy though.

PSA: I am now wide awake!
And I somehow managed to not touch myself (yet). But I did get pretty angry at you at a certain point, it's kind of frustrating being told what to do, and I believe that I'd actually have a greater chance of abstaining without your involvement in the matter. But your comment on me being "fun" keeps me somehow shackled to you, at least for the time being. Furthermore I just can't shake off this feeling of being "too dirty" to become a good boy(tm) for you :/

--- 73139857
>>73139827
>ik how much i suck
Doesn't sound like it, when you blame your failure to find a bf on all the other gays instead of taking some of that responsibility. I wish you had stated that "I know how much I suck" in your previous post so you could make it clear that your loneliness is not other gays' fault, but your own 
Hook-up culture is neither predominant nor horrible. But you are.

I can't, we are so very far away, you will never really open your heart to me, not anonymously, not online. You won't bridge the gap (the abyssal crevice) to real life. We would just waste each other's time, which is probably what you're looking forward to. 
You need a real boy, in real life, making eye contact with you, to know how silly you've been. Only then you'll realize how silly it is to be a gay celibate in our world

hue is a vigilant amazonigger with an axe to grind and a promised pension from tinder and grindr if he continues shilling dating apps. he's been coming to these threads *very* frequently for the last few years and shows no signs of retreat. he draws people in with the weakest bait imaginable and clogs up the thread arguing with his catches for hours at a time, continually putting essentially the same zero effort response in slightly different phrasing over and over and over again, and raking in the (You)'s from new idiots to the thread who have a compulsive need to defend themselves against any slight even if it's an obvious troll.

frankly, it amuses me to no end that he does it so well, and no matter the warnings that other anons give to newfags about to fall into his trap, the newfags never seem to listen and respond almost invariably with braindead "i'll do what i want" and etc responses, only to be dragged into a closed circuit of identical responses for 250 posts. the guy is an artiste, i'll concede that.

On getting a bf?
--- 73140868
>>73140839
The only way to remain single when you have a dating life is if you want to. The opportunities just come and you take them. It would happen to you too, if you stopped hiding in your room.
--- 73140880
>>73140868
I leave you alone now, you are obviously scared of me.
--- 73140899
>>73140880
Scared of a virgin who's too scared to go out and have a date? 
Frightened. Terrorized even. 
When will you do something to get a bf other than waiting in inaction?
--- 73140909
do gaybots think of doing something degrading or romantic to their fbf?
i wonder how many would enjoy some self-degradation from the partner's side.
--- 73140935

You should worry more about how to get a bf, and less about super specific hypothetical scenarios of things you want to do to them

I'm so glad you asked that. First you download dating apps. Then you talk to people over there. Then you go to a date and meet each other. 
Repeat this until you've found him.
--- 73141055
>>73141047
I already did this, I only found fat brazil sluts

Oh chud... You're so lonely and so broken
--- 73141077
>>73141055
>everyone around me is fat 
These cheap generalizations are the true mark of someone who has never tried. We see it all the time in here, usually it's "everyone is 45, fat and disgusting". 
Unfortunately that is not the whole truth. You're not the only young gay person in a radius, but if other young gay guys are rejecting you, what does that say about you?

he is in the elementary school at the moment, he loves math.

Worse than being a lonely lunatic spreading hate online? 
It could be a lot better too, you know. You could have a friend and a bf, but no, you have to be this hateful caricature

You're lame. You ditch friends with one hand and with the other you come crying about loneliness in here. 
Friends are the spice of life. So sad that you don't have any. No wonder you're so bitter
--- 73141235
>>73141211
Lmao your kid brother who's in elementary school is already out of the closet and already has a bf...
And you're still there being stuck as a lonely celibate? 
Seems like you have so much to learn from your brother

i never ditched anyone.

--- 73141359
>>73141333
>I didn't ditch them
You ditched all the people in highschool and after that who could have potentially become your friends. 
Same thing for a bf. 
You moved away to the middle of a desert? No, there are still people right there where you live, including single gay guys who you could date. And yet, you refuse to. 
Being a lonely chud is currently your priority in life. Like smoking crack is a crackhead's priority

--- 73141440
>>73141371
Maybe you look ok and you're just insecure ?
--- 73141466
>>73141386
I had poor social skills in highschool too, anon. But instead of blaming everyone for my loneliness way into my 20s, I just grew up and developed social skills through continuous attempts, lots of tries and lots of errors until I landed myself a group of friends who couldn't fit in anywhere else, so we banded together. 
I wish you would do something similar, but instead you're stuck in this self pity loop of blaming everyone else for your troubles and doing nothing to improve your loneliness.
--- 73141470

no, there's definitely something off

You really hate yourself that much?
Just stop. Go kiss a boy

i mean it's not like you can just fucking go somewhere and say hey i know i'm in my mid twenties but i'm an emotionally stunted fucking retard and don't even know how to ask for a haircut or what i want to do with my appearance so it feels like my only option is to sit here wanting to throw up just thinking about it until i kill myself
--- 73142502
>>73142479
>it's not like you can just fucking go somewhere
You can. Your fears may hold you down, but you have the potential to best them.
Your options are nearly endless. All you have to do is try. You can start with the dating apps.

Please don't do that.

How bout English accent ?
Or Irish one?
--- 73144349
>>73144337
depends on the clarity of the accent
--- 73144379
>>73144349
I see
It's kinda fun yknow, how about American accents?
Any you dislike?
I don't like the Californian one
--- 73144420
Tonight I'm having another hot chocolate because its like a hug you can drink and I crave comfort
I put a mango rum in it this time, it clashes a bit but it's ok

>>73144420
Clashes how?
Sounds great!!
--- 73144455
>>73144436
I'm not sure, I'm terrible at describing tastes
I guess maybe the sweetness of the mango rum and the sweetness of the chocolate are like competing with each other? 
Last week I tried whisky and regular dark rum and they worked great because they like compliment the chocolate without drowning it out I guess? 
It's still nice just not as good as those

im not sure which you mean but they are annoying but for me this one is because of vocabulary

Vocabulary ?

Black accents and ways of speech are a bit odd but I think they're fun sometimes
--- 73144560

I force myself not to drink alcohol simply because the weight gain aggravates me so much.
In the past year I've limited my alcohol to only getting drunk like once per 2 weeks on average, but I haven't had a drink in over 5 weeks now

 You could burn anywhere from 3k to 6k calories per day and up depending on your build and workout routine. Unless you are going crazy on the food and abusing sweet drinks and butter it's not difficult to maintain weight.

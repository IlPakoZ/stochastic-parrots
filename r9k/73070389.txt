I dont understand why people take drugs when the world is chokefull of comparatively healthier, easily accessible pleasures like processed food, pornography, videogames, millions of hobbies etc. how hedonically starved you gotta be to destroy yourself with hard drugs, are they actually that good?

Processed food and pornography are easily as harmful as drugs over time, OP. Of course you don't get it, you're deeply amused by eating twinkies and seeing plap plap on a screen.

You're probably just crying sour grapes cause mom told you to fuck off when you asked for a ride to the dispensary lol.

Hypothetically speaking, is it wrong if I beat up drunk people laying on the street?
It's just a hypothesis I don't do that seriously.
It's totally not a way to vent my anger I have towards my alcoholic father.

No, thats what public spaces are made for.
Fight strangers especially homeless and junkies, for you are our natural selection.

In the current year, your ability to do this without being spotted on a security camera - either in the act, or approaching or leaving the area - is practically zero.

Yes, instead of seeking to confront the actual issue deep within you project it upon others and attack them physically.
It'll fix nothing and is a sign you need help before you kill someone.

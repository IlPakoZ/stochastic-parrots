no way women actually like or want sex

Many say they don't care. But I shit you not, women are more hornier, than men are. They hide it really well.

WJY HIDE IT!? they want to get fucked, we want to fuck. LET'S FUCK THEN we all want the same thing. God damn.
--- 73159523
>>73159473
that's what i mean though; no way what you're saying isn't a fucking cope/larp.

i think men are objectively hornier than women; i would even argue that women don't really feel sexual desire and lust like we do, otherwise they'd be just as degenerate as we are
--- 73159543
You're right. Whores don't exist....
--- 73159558
>>73159543
no they do, but they don't actually like sex.

there's gotta be a more sinister reason they're whoring around the way they do

Man, you are so far off. Men probably are hornier, i'm not one so I can't have much of an opinion on that, but your second point is wrong. I masturbate usually every day and often more than once a day and I think about sex constantly. I don't watch porn, but I read tons of smutty fanfics as a hobby and have toyed with the idea of writing my own. I have all kinds of degenerate sexual fantasies that I'm ashamed of and won't even tell my future husband about because they're so gross. Women vary obviously, but some of us do have high sex drives

okay fair enough, but would you say you're the norm? i'm of the impression that women being obsessed with smut is a meme for most women out there.

assuming you're right, what does sexual desire/lust even feel like for women? also enlighten us with your degenerate fantasies.
--- 73159663
>>73159620
also another point i'm wondering, if women are reading smut and masturbating every day and have degenerate fantasies like you say, then why isn't the coomer lifestyle as destructive for women as it is for men?

Please, do it. The world needs more smut

50 shades of gray. It doesn't even have to be good smut

I'm not sure, I personally think I might be abnormal but I don't have many friends and I don't talk about sex with my friends ever. Women being into smut is definitely not a meme though, idk if you've ever been on ao3 but there's a whole world of stuff out there mostly written by women. I get my fics from tumblr typically though because I'm not a fujo. Some of my favorite fics have intricate plots and character development and are 100k+ words, the story being good makes the smut even hotter. I'm not sure if men feel like that about porn having a plot, it doesn't seem that way to me. Sexual desire itself is pretty simple for me, once I'm worked up I just really want something on my clit and something filling me up until that want boils over and I have to do something about it. I imagine the sensation is nowhere near the urgent feeling of having an erection, but it does throb and ache

I'm guessing it has something to do with post nut clarity. I have nothing like that, if I'm horny I just masturbate, cum, think wow that felt nice, and just go on about my day. I don't feel or think any differently after.

I like and want it, in conjunction with pregnancy and having kids.

>>73159436 (OP)
my gf drained the cum out of me until there was nothing left. i didn't want to go 3 rounds, 2 is quite enough. my dick just gets uncomfortable and chafed by that point
--- 73159943
>>73159473
This cope is weird. They clearly want it to but don't say they want it more faggot. They're not the ones paying for it, chasing after every not hideous dude they see, watching metric fucktons of porn etc.

I only desire sex with someone I have an emotional connection with. So I'll die alone probably, never understood how casual sex is a thing.

>>73159773
You are definitely abnormal, but most men have an even higher sex drive. It is basically all-consuming, constant, and doesn't need any buildup.

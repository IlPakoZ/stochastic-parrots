The answer you want to hear:
AHHHHH SCARY JEWS ARE AT IT AGAIN RUN FOR THE HILLS
The real answer:
It's a cheap, easy, and versatile crop. Whatever happened to the corn after it left the farms you can blame on whOever, but the gov was probably trying to help farmers in earnest when those subsidies were introduced.

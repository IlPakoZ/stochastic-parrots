This study is not only old as shit but also was done on people who were dead at the time.
You would have proved your point harder if you actually linked something.

Why are you such a lazy shit.

PUMP HARD &amp; FAST &amp; OFTEN, BROS!

Is there any reason to doubt the study? We're already seeing and living in the aftereffects of women's rights on an international scale.

--- 73021949
>>73021804
Its not to doubt the study but
A, you help people who are looking at it by having links
B. so you dont get used to looking at headlines and just accepting it.

The fact that this was done on corpses who were in their prime in the 80s and that this study is based on information from 15 years ago is important. Negligence on this is how you get set up for traps later on.

Taking a picture of some head line from some place is useless on its own and just leads to misinformation. You need everything to be right. Even when something is apriori.
--- 73022042
From what I have read, these studies refer to male DNA as a result of pregnancy with a male baby, as in it's the baby's DNA.

Suggesting the male DNA is from male sexual partners is misleading.
--- 73022056
>>73022042
The point of the studies it that half the women didn't have male children, miscarriages, or abortions.
You're just as lazy as op, he didnt leave any studies and you didn't bother to look at any.
--- 73022081
>>73021603 (OP)
I like how some years back, this was just studies done on mice or something, and the absolute vitriol and adamant certainty that microchimerism is NOT and could NEVER be true for humans

Listen, I may not have high opinion of women, but even I think that's a step too far.
--- 73022189
>>73021603 (OP)
I'm curious what mechanism could introduce said dna into foid.
I know that vagina tries to absorb and recycle what it can. What can't be results in periods.
Could it be something akin to prion disease?
--- 73022203
>>73021603 (OP)
But they'll deny the fuck out of this because they cannot accept it

Quote:

'Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion, vanished male twin, an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation, or sexual intercourse.'

Translation:

Even though the women in this study haven't had male pregnancies it could be a result of unknown male pregnancies.
Also, heck, it could be sex because we're just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.

Conclusion:

Male DNA is from being pregnant with a boy.
Male DNA from women who haven't been pregnant with a boy is probably because they actually have been pregnant with a boy.
Male DNA from sexual partners is basically opinion at best.

>>73022302
>see what sticks
Yes in the almost 20 year old study. I'm sure in there are more recent ones like what OP's picture is referencing that are more conclusive. You have to imagine a study that shows sperms effect on womens mind wouldnt go anywhere.

My sources are only what I found on the topic. If >>73021603 (OP) >>73021804 shared his and not just a screen capture we wouldnt have this problem.
--- 73022797
>>73022302
So as a minimum foids who got pregnant and aborted their kids would have this too?
--- 73023061
>>73022081
Yeah there is every reason they want to sweep this under the rug hoping people never find out the truth. It would collapse all societies as we know them and men would seriously start to reflect on the real nature of reality. It is very clear women should never be promiscuous.
--- 73023927
>>73021633
learning this fact a few years back unironically helped me achieve some solace. even if some woman were to settle for me, there'd be no point for me to date them, as i wouldn't be able to secure my lineage and it definitely wouldn't be a romantic romance, more so just one out of convenience. takes no hymen, no diamond to the next level. 
>>73021715
happens in other species. no study that says the opposite.

--- 73024064

--- 73024097

Did you guys miss the part where the study was done or corpses? Unless.you're dating and fucking corpses on Tinder, in which case you have bigger problems than sperm in their brains.
--- 73024122

Does this happen to gayfags too or does semen realize when it has been bamboozled and deposited into another man?
--- 73024212
>>73024097
>Muh corpses
Again- are you implying we should dissect brains of living women?
That is some seriously weird objection, anon.
--- 73024243
>>73024122
Depends on exact mechanism of the process.
If it's low key prion disease, then probably, since ass also anus also absorbs nutrients.
If it's only result of pregnancy, then obviously not.
Either way good look detecting it, since it's not unusual to find male dna in faggot brains.
In fact I'm pretty sure it's expected, lol
--- 73024275
>>73024243
If they were able to identify male DNA from different individuals in women they could do the same in men if this is not just a byproduct of pregnancy. But I doubt that study, or any further studies on microchimerism, will ever happen. The possible >implications would be too harmful for globohomo's agendas.

The brain starts decaying almost immediately after death, so cadaver studies done on it aren't very useful. You'll just have to live with not knowing.

reminder that telegony is real and if a woman was ever been creampied she is storing genetic information from sperm in her uterus

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35843387/

Uterosomes: The lost ring of telegony

According to evidence, telegony may occur either through the infiltration of sperm into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract or the presence of fetal genes in the mother's blood. It is highlighted that sperm penetrates into the mucosa of the uterine and possibly alters the genetic structure, affecting the embryo and enduring from one pregnancy to the next, which may be one of the potential mechanisms of telegony. Uterine fluid, uterine gland-derived histotroph, supplies key nutrients for successful embryo implantation and it is important during the first trimester, especially, because of its susceptibility to maternal states. The presence of EVs in uterine fluid (uterosomes) was reported in mice, sheep, and humans, including a wide range of biomolecules, such as proteins, and non-coding RNAs. In this review article, we presented a new idea to explain telegony. Based on our idea, after the previous male sperm entry into the female reproductive system, those sperm which do not participate in fertilization penetrate into the somatic cells of the uterus and store their genetic/epigenetic information there. The sperm of the next partner reaches a location in the female reproductive canal where it exchanges information with the uterosomes and obtains the proteins and non-coding RNAs required for fertilization, development, and implantation.

Not only that but it was only performed on parous women. The only women who carried male DNA were those who had sons. And the remaining DNA was found to be inherited from the womens fathers, not sexual partners. Incels are genuinely retarded holy shit kek.

So those people saying 23andme gives you a fake 1% african to fuck with you are just unaware that their mom had bbc several times and hlnowntheu have microchimerism?

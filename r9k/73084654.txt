I'll probably kill 50 people, take pictures of the bodies, and then go back home like nothing happened and live in my bunker while no one knows what is happening.

Either killing animals or sex with animals.
It's half the life-span in prison forever.

I think I will kill a male animal soon.
I get mad when I see that I am living in prison forever.

I can't even drive to the NSA office and kill everyone inside because they'll just boost the funding to the NSA even if I kill 15 people before they kill me, and the bullshit will intensify after I die.

And then once the nukes hit the people responsible will be long gone, so I can't go over there after it's over and start shooting people either because it will be over.

Everyone in that office deserves a slow and painful death from a bullet hole to the stomach and to watch their guts seep out of their bodies.

I want to take a gun and personally shoot everyone to death inside that building.

I would do it, but I will never get to.

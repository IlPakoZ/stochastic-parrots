Why are teenage girls always filming me?

I go for a walk to the shop every second day and always pass teenage girls doing tik tok dances. They'll always stop and wait until I'm in the frame before commencing another one, and I see them always pointing their phone cameras towards me.

I'm a 30 year old male btw, so I don't think it's an attraction thing at all.

The same kind of bs they try to pull at the gym, probably. They'll make up anything for clout.

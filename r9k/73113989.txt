Yep.
I have some rare burst where I play 3-4 hours every day for a couple of weeks and that's it.
If I uninstall literally everything the urge gets back, I waste time setting shit up and then I don't play anything.
So I just dual boot W10 and I have a bunch of games I never play.

How'd you do it anon?
I fear I'm too stupid to even do half of that.

just watch some youtube videos at first just to get the basic idea of things and then follow instructions in the manual, it takes some time to figure out how shit works but it's no rocket science, i did it because i was genuinely passionate about pc hardware and it saves you some money

Tip: start cheap and/or pick up some used rig off of craigslist, disassemble it, then put it back together.

You do not want to be fucking up with $700 parts. That will turn you off from PC building forever.

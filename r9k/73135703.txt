Why does my left testicle hurt whenever I stand for too long? It's a dull, aching pain but it can be sharp sometimes. I'm circumcised just in case this has anything to do with it.

I think you have varicocele. It lowers your testosterone and causes male infertility. Being circumcised has got nothing to do with it.

There muscles that hold your balls up and down. When you wear underwear your whole life those muscles atrophy and weaken.
Go underwear free once a week for tesicular health.. personally I call it freeball Friday.

Does anyone else get the urge to pee every few weeks that comes on suddenly and doesnt go away after peeing? I usually just end up sitting on the toilet for an hour or so before it ends. Its fucking annoying and has been happening for as long as i can remember. What's wrong with my bladder?

Does it feel like there is some pee in your pp that just doesnt want to go away no matter how long you spend on the toilet?

NTA but sometimes i literally spend 5 minutes pissing just to get the last drop out. otherwise i can feel it inside of my dick and sometimes it just pops out while i move

is this a sign of early prostate cancer? or just turbo autism?

That is usually one of two things. Either you're prone to getting mild UTIs for whatever reason (weak immune system, lack of hygiene). Or, you're jerking off and this irritates your urethra. The second one is rare and usually you get that sensation if you pee right after ejaculating sometimes. But it does happen, it's just rare enough that most consider it a meme.

Pretty much yeah. And i keep peeing slightly every minute or so but the urge remains. Ive been in the bathroom for almost 40 minutes

The urge to pee has finally gone away, life is good again.

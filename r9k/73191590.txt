Did a successful Jew under Rome become the Messiah? No, it was one who was treated most unfairly while still being known.

It is Chris Chan. It is too fitting. People will lament how poorly he was treated, how he was "killed" in front of the public while none cared. The morals of the future will unironically be to act like Chris Chan, if such a thing is possible.

I don't know if it's just me but for the past two years 80% of the girls on Tinder were ugly; and they're ugly because 80% of the girls on Tinder were obese or fat
The rest of them are, skinny or thicc, above average Stacies and Beckies. Which means a guy like me is fucked
What happened to the average looking girls that used the app from 2016-2020?
Could it just be my city or state? Or is it a bigger phenomenon?

Girls do not exist. Do not go outside or you will die.

So you have something in common, which is great

I'm average looking and even if I was ugly I'm still not obese or fat like most of the women on that app
I deserve my looksmatch at the very least

Looksmatch means you match based on looks and nothing else. If you are only matching with fat girls, thats your looksmatch

I believe it started around 2019 or around the time Covid started.
I'm assuming you live in the U.S. If that's true maybe it's a U.S thing.

So a skinny average looking man is on the same level as an obese woman now? Wow. I fucking hate the year of our Lord 2023

>>73151013
Lol no it's not
--- 73151046
>>73151033
yes because a lot of skinny guys like fat/obese girls have you not seen that it's commonplace
--- 73151047
>>73151016
I do live in the US. That Covid theory makes the most sense but I also feel like maybe the average girls are using different apps or something

You can hate the year or you can learn that dating apps are not real.

Maybe Black or African guys. Also thicc/thick is not the same thing as fat or obese. I'm tired of seeing girls put "thicc" on their fucking bio when they're 230lbs fat asses.

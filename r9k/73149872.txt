hobos are subhuman. how can a human being live like this? how do you have so little shame, pride, or decency? its so fucking disgusting. the only thing im giving these degenerates is a fat wad of spit from now on.

A hobo is someone who travels and works. A tramp is someone who travels and doesn't work. A bum is someone who neither travels nor works. A homebum is a long-term professional bum.

Don't call homebums "hobos". You've never met a hobo.

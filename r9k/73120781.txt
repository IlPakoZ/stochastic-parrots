I could have made it to high normiehood if my mom forced me to play football and didn't enable my antisocial tendencies

Seems to be most people's (myself included) problem. Hypothetically, if I were to have a child, I don't know if I would force them to be normie. I've seen kids who were forced to socialize and they hate their parents for it. I also know that as a kid, I would have hated being forced to do something like that, even though it would have helped me probably. At the time, I was content to just play vidya all day. If my child were content at the time, even though I know that later on they will regret it, it would be hard to force them into a sport or club.

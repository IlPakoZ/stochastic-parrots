The modern woman just wants to drink wine and party rather than start a family and be a mother. Sad!

They want to. But they cannot, that's the difference.

Look at their eyes
Anyone who interacts with 35+ women knows how desperate the single ones are

Who the fuck does this? Are you perhaps a TRP idiot who thinks he reached male prime finally?

No, Im 25 myself
But due to my life circunstances I interact with people from all age groups, and some of these people confide to me about their sex and romantic lifes
I dont interact with them in a sexual or romantic context myself

i can't drink heavily due to being small and get that embarrassing asian glow. 

 i just miss my ex bf and will probably never marry or have kids because of it lol

I see it as the opposite. Less people are going out partying and more are settling down as couples. Of course, not with us

Women who drink are so disgusting.

They probably wanted to, but since "Superman Chad Enchanted Prince Billionaire" didn't exactly cross their path and swoop them off their feet, they settled into the stupidest, most nefarious shit idea in modern society: anything that feels good is good and you should indulge in it.

Modern women have no fucking idea of what reality is since modern society is hell bent on being gynocentric to unhealthy levels, as such they are all playing on easy level. And the constant stream of bulsshit from social media doesn't help, they are all deluded.

As such you have homely chicks who work shit jobs thinking that the average guy who works down the street at the factory/shop/whatever other shit job is a complete loser, a spectacular woman like her deserves at least a tall good looking guy who owns his own business and drives a Maserati.
They have requirements lists for men that look like they are buying a car:
- Electric windows, check
- AC, check
- Reversing camera, check
- Sun roof, check
Except with men it's more dysfunctional and detached from reality:
- Over 6 foot tall (there goes 80% of all men)
- Earns over $100k (which in the US is like twice the average, the previous 20% of men? Dwindled to even lower)
- In great physical shape
- 8x6" dick
...
...
By the end there's like 0.01% of the male population left in the women's "Possible prospects" list.
Sure they will fuck and suck hundreds of guys who don't fit everything on the list, but they'll never "settle" for them.

>Who the fuck does this?
People who have a fucking job in an industry that has women?
Or do you think "interact" means "fuck"? Because women aren't exactly silent about how fucking miserable they are. Problem is Chad isn't drilling her cunt to newer depths and financing a lavish fantasy like lifestyle with his immense fortune, which is the only thing she would settle for, because she knows she's worth it.

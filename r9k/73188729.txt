It feels kinda motivational, but I still don't wanna do anything. Not even losing my V-card seems worth the effort. Do any of you anon want to do something before parting? Think of it like this, what would you do if you heard you'd die tomorrow?

Life wouldn't be fun if it wasn't for impending death.

seems like inevitable death would make you more motivated to lose your virginity because you'd want to fully experience all of life you could before dying, but, whatever.
truth is, sex is kind of disappointing. especially if youve spent years romanticizing sex and looking forward to it and then you have to work your ass off trying to find a gf or wife to give it to you. its not really worth it.

Death is redundant when there's an afterlife. I don't want to burn in hell for eternity so I must be a good boy and not commit sin.

nothing matters in the end, we're all gonna die, just do what you like, it's pointless to chase others

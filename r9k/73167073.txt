bpds are actually secondary psychopaths, primary psychopathy is something different
--- 73167210
BPD is really just Vulnerable Narcissism but women fool people into believing they actually care about anyone other than themselves far more often than men.
--- 73167221
in my experience bpd dont want help they just want an excuse to be insane
--- 73167231
BPD girls can fucking all kill themselves. They are not cute or fun or intense in a romantic way - they are simply and only recipe for disaster and heartbreak. Fuck those lying whores 

>>73167159
>Too good too soon
>Very intense
>Amazing sex
>Too many good coincidences
>Mirrors you
>History of unstable relationships including friendships and family
>Gets mad for petty bullshit

That's a good start to see it coming but it's really hard to detect. As the other anon said BPD girls are demons, they will fuck your life over. Do not engage with them AT ALL FUCKING COST

Yeah the girl I knew with BPD didn't have any of that.

The only early warning thing is she liked goth culture but dressed normally. No piercings, no tattoos, raised Catholic, STEM graduate degree, very little experience in bed, but it turned out she was a complete psycho behind the quiet exterior. This took time to show itself.

One thing is she listed herself as bisexual on the dating profile but a lot of girls do that.

npd and bpd are 2 different disorders and the thought processes that are behind them are completely different faggot retard
you just want a meaner name to call them because narcissist sounds worse than borderline.
--- 73167281
>>73167159
she will probably have it posted on social media to some capacity because they see it as some cute sexy trait. i know this girl who thinks that men seek her out for having bpd because apparently it makes them kinky. wtf

Yes, most of these applied to her. She was excited when I just invited her to meet the second time. She got mad at me for cheating on her in a dream she had. Then she wanted an open relationship because she was afraid I wouldn't commit to her. Many things like that.

>Amazing sex
Unfortunately this didn't apply. Contrary to memes BPDs can either be sex demons or frigid. It's one or the other unfortunately.

"BPD and sex can complicate even the longest-standing relationships. Those diagnosed with borderline tend to be sexually impulsive or sexually avoidant. Sexual impulsivity can lead to an increased rate of risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and sexual avoidance can negatively impact romantic relationships."

Yet bpd are the mentally unwell ones. Lmao okay.

All this. I've had a couple friends with BPD (they're unavoidable as friends to any weird girl) and all of these traits are accurate ways of describing them and the relationship stories they tell me.

One thing you should always always ask about is their relationship with their parents. Ask them if they would get into arguments with their parents a lot, and then ask what those arguments were about. She'll skew the details but if the topic at hand doesn't sound like a big deal, it probably wasn't.

"Personality disorders" are such a bunch of shit, we don't need specific diagnoses for people who are just cunts, just call them cunts.
--- 73167405
>>73167370
You're not making your argument very well just showing how unstable you are. The only purported difference for BPD to NPS is supposedly BPD are capable of caring about others. Which as I've already said this is just because women fool more people and get away with narcissism way more often. As I said don't be fooled guys avoid these females completely.
--- 73168319
Narcissists and borderlines are all cunts. Schizoids the only ones with a sane, acceptable and harmless personality disorder.

Everyone who acts toxic has a justification in their mind, idiot. The mental illness part come in with what you percieve as "mistreatment" and how severly you react. In your case, "mistreatment" (presumably) means petty bullshit that normal people have no issue with

I've been chatting with a BPD girl on discord and it's seemed fine so far, she's a little clingy but I've been waiting for a single person I can dumb all my attention into. Anyway if I abandon her it just proves her right if "being mean" (occasionally) is the worst you're saying ill be dealing with she's going to have to abandon me if she wants to get rid of me.

She unblocks me and accepts my friend requests, she just has meltdowns and it takes time.
She doesn't like actually want the relationship to end.
--- 73171918
>>73171905
If she always unblocks you have you asked why she does it in the first place? What's her justification there?
--- 73171927
>>73171918
It's just apart of BPD, I learned after I looked up how to deal with a gf who has BPD.
She's professionally diagnosed not saying I diagnosed her myself.
Idk why though maybe I'll ask once she unblocks me.

BPD is increasing in males too, gay males have probably the highest rates out of any group, and bpd males tend to be even more overt and worse people, but in my experience they also recover much better. In fact, besides all the memes it has an excellent rate of remission IF the person actually wants to recover.
--- 73172625

they wouldn't have unstable relations if they just dated a nice robot and had the willpower to just chill out and care for him and be a good gf.

The only answer: unless she's been in dbt for years seriously, cut her out of your life. You cant be in a relationship with someone who doesnt share the same reality as you or other non psychotic people.

In general relationships with people who have not learned how to manage their maladaptive coping mechanism are inadvisable. But everyone posting on this board is profoundly mentally ill and no one in this thread is in any position to accuse others of having a personality disorder kek

>there are people out there that married their sweetheart from high school and they both will be happy forever with a consistent blue-pilled worldview that doesn't contradicts their experiences

What is the difference between that and a robot/animal? Never achieving a modicum of awareness/sentience of their existence and the universe as they follow their impulses consistently with success. I am not here to say that I necessarily live better than them for knowing, but I wonder why people value free will so much if happiness can be achieved with hard constraints. It makes me question the validity of happiness itself. Why should it be a motive when it is mere neurotransmitters and fated faggotry? So claimed free will advocating be happyfags are btfo by these (for a lack of a better term) npcs

>there are guys out there who got into anal sex in elementary or middle school and were able to correctly sniff out which black guys would be into gay sex so they didn't get beaten up or exposed as gay and got to experience mind blowing orgasms in nigger gangbangs every day

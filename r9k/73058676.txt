Reminder that the entire modern American "woke/chud" culture war can ultimately be traced back to the fact that feminist frequency came in off the heels of Jack Thompson and cemented neoconservative evangelicals and progressive liberals as two side of the same coin who simply wanted to strong arm you into giving up your videogames in the eyes of the online gaming community.

/int/ for random adjacent board lol

Other than that you actually need to have interests to properly participate in the hobby boards. If you're just a broken retard with no real convictions except a strong desire to post race bait all day every day then unfortunately you will continue to rot on /r9k/ and /b/ indefinitely.

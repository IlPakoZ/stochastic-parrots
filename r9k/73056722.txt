Fuck off you're either a fat fuck or a tranny
There are no women like you in person, and those who are do it because NO MAN gives a fuck about them

--- 73057275
>>73056722 (OP)
Based on my experiences with women, I can confidently tell you what they want.

Some want the guy that'll feel lucky to have them (fat ugly bastard dating pretty girl). Others want the guy that they'll get arrested for being with (teacher dating student). Others want the guy that'll make them feel used up (dating thugs, delinquents). There is no in-between. Women are retarded, delusional. There is nothing they want, or anything good that they ever want.

the issue is you can still smell the stink under that, imo it makes it more disgusting.
ideally i keep up my routine of attempting to shower more, use my pretty rose oil and hopefully i don't scare a boy off when the time comes.

to be fair, i know from experience i can be quite clingy, obsessive, jealous, codependent, and rapey. but i can't keep a girl longer than 5 years, so i figure i'm probably the problem and not her.
--- 73058143
Most women want a psychotic violent criminalistic dark triad chimpy chad bully type of character that has a soft spot only for them and only when convenient.
Other than that they want to watch him destroy , obliterate and dominate the world and other men because it gets that pussy wet.

Have you thought about turning bathing/showering into an activity you do for reasons other than cleaning yourself as a way to make it an easier life choice for you? So you could do it for relaxing, masturbation, aromatherapy etc

Intelligence, a connection and acceptance. I could go into minutia but that's what it mostly boils down to. The latter two means I'll likely never really have what I want.

>The latter two means I'll likely never really have what I want.
Why do you think no one would accept you?
--- 73059282
>>73056722 (OP)
Ok I'm going to divide it in several categories in order for it to be understandable.

>The mandatory requirements
Everything listed here is pretty much required for me to consider someone a potential candidate.

>Kindness towards me and other people
>Being entertaining to be with
>Confidence
Very important, both men and women love confident partners that won't constantly question themselves and that are able to get stuff done.
>Being a healthy person physically and mentally
>Being respectful of people and of me as his partner
So no seeing me as lesser in the relationship.
>Allowing me to have financial freedom
>Monogamy
This one is personal, some girls may not mind polygamy so take it with a grain of sand
>Having personal hygiene
>Being understanding of diversity
Racism and so on is disgusting
>Being a functioning human being capable of holding a job, going outside and interacting with other people
>Sharing mutual interests in various topics
>Being kind towards animals
>Being dominant in bed
>Being loving

>The preferred requirements
Stuff here is not required at all but it would be very welcome, missing these isn't a deal breaker at all! Just preferences, if everything above applies, this is just a welcome addition. 

>Not being bald
>Being taller than me
It's not hard as I am 5'2
>Being conventionally attractive for male standards
>Being well educated
>Being wealthy or having a promising career
>Giving in to my kinks like rape play, treating me roughly, fun stuff
>Having glasses
They make everyone look cuter
>Having an above average dick size
>Giving me cuddles and affection often and being open to random displays of affection
>Being slightly younger than me, maybe 3 to 5 years
--- 73059327
>>73056722 (OP)
Seriously? Why do you even care? You will never reach their ideal no matter how much you self-improve; if you did, you wouldn't be here on /r9k/.

Seriously, stop caring what women think, especially of you. Doing so will make your quality of life better by tenfold as you no longer worry about being seen as a "creep," "incel," etc. for simply existing.
As long as you don't get zogbots trying to shit on you for breathing the same air as Stacy, stop giving a shit on what they think. Their thoughts are the least important thing of the universe, and even more so on the present day where you should be worrying about the collapse of the U.S. and the upcoming CBDC tyranny.

I am currently studying to become a pharmacist, which earn about 2k a month baseline and more with seniority, so I can provide financial stability, I am an accomplished cook, I know how to do house chores, I am a very affectionate and loving partner judging by what my boyfriend says, obviously I can provide sex, I help my boyfriend vent about his problems and listen to him, I look fairly pretty, that's the most of it off of the top of my head.

>>73059331
It's why I wanted to comment on it, I think most people out there don't have insane standards when it comes to partners, and also it's normal for you to fail at some, you're probably in a rough spot right now, it's not easy being kind and taking care of yourself when you are depressed, but hopefully the post can give you some hope that you don't have to be a super model to find a partner, I believe in you!

>>73059364
Nope, I am white, I just have no tolerance for that kind of behavior.

>>73059374
Not sure how to refer to that, but it shouldn't be too hard to gauge what the appropriate level of confidence should be in a given context.

I simply find it most funny how naive you are.
If you haven't noticed, all complaints your biological sex has regarding men would be completely gone if NIGGERS were wiped out of the Earth alongside their "culture" related to crime and drugs. But you are too stupid to realize that, or too much of a virtue signaler to at least admit how dangerous it is for the average woman to be near a NIGGER.
This is my last (You) I'll give you, btw. At least I know you are a femoid since you'll evade my thesis at all cost, like the typical female """intellectual""".

Superiority. At the most fundamental level they want the best man in the room.
--- 73059822
>>73059784
You can make more than that even as just a pharmacy technician, let alone a pharmacist. America may be a shithole with weak safety nets for people at the bottom of the economic pyramid, but the flipside is that you'll get a higher salary once you really become valuable.
--- 73059859
>>73059822
I guess that makes sense... Considering college is really expensive the jobs gatekept behind it must offer a higher pay, like, for example, with the right subsidies, such as detractions for lower income in the family, I only have to spend 400 euros a year on tuition, but even in the worst case scenario I'd have to spend 2.5k a year, which is probably still a lot cheaper than tuition in America.
--- 73059892
>>73059859
Definitely a lot cheaper. The smartest thing a non-American can do when they want to make money is come to America. The smartest thing an American can do when they need to spend money is leave America.
--- 73059937
>>73059784

Oh yeah? I think I will do it though, just watch me.

>>73059958
Well, to be fair textbooks are really fucking expensive here as well, but no one gets them legally, you can just pirate them and save money, fuck having to pay 60 bucks for a book I'll get to use once.
--- 73060026
>>73059981
Yeah, that's the cost for not paying 70% of your SMALL, SMALL, income in taxes. Better to have some temporary debt in America if it means no life of poverty. 

The problem is this yuroroastie is playing both sides here. Soaking up the socialism in one country and then coming to one she probably hates for the economic benefits. And you're simping for the bitch.

>>73059989

Nah if it were an erotic fanfic, I'd tell you how weak your boyfriend probably is (both physically and mentally) to be with a foid like you.

I'd burst into your shared apartment at night, throw him to the wall as he weakly resists, giving short gasps and cries, and then I'd have my way with you for hours, and you'd welcome a strong man seizing what's his.

I can't imagine abusing someone i love and respect. And i can't imagine treating as equal someone who submits to me and someone i degrade in bed.

--- 73060562

yeah i can do those, is it over?
--- 73060580
>>73060525
There is nothing inherently wrong with men that like to submit to a woman sexually, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with one because it obviously clashes with my needs.
Abusing and degrading someone who submits to you in bed and respecting them as your partner in your everyday life aren't mutually exclusive.

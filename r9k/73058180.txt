I watched it. Actually liked it more than I thought I would.

same. I was skeptical about a show centred on vampires, since I never liked crap like twilight and thought it was juvenile. but this has some good comedy, it's not terrible.

>turns his bully into his feed (drinks his blood)
>bedazzles another vampire, uses him as his personal servant
>gets the girl

it's 10 episodes about 40 minutes each. good time waster and it's an entertaining watch.

enjoy!

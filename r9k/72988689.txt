Fembots, would you date a guy that just wanted to be given a hug and some positive reinforcement every once in a while? What I mean is just given a gentle embrace while being called a good boy. Asking for a friend of course.

Good taste, OP. I'd love to experience that. But I don't think there are any women into that.

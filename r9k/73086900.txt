Demoralisation as in what? I hate you zoomers making vague threads and running off to discord or Instagram because your ADHD brains can't focus on one thing at a time.

I feel that, I see all these branches going out from the current point of my life and none of them seem appealing at all. Maybe I just have to make a major change and see what happens, the future is hard to predict anyways.

Balding isn't end of the world. I keep head always shaved and never saw any difference. I was bitchless before and bitchless now.

I've deeply loved my good hair though. Woke up and noticed a slight recession from the sides and thinning on some areas and it legitimately destroyed all motivation I had for the day. I've shown people before and they say it's not that bad but still it's best to expect the worse.

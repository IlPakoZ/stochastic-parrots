I have never felt like killing myself as much as I do now. This little origami pig took me over an hour to make and I started crying during my third attempt. I was watching a step by step video and I simply couldn't understand it. I am such a failure. Even folding paper is too complicated for me.

There's a sporadic /creative/ thread.
I'd love to see more paper folding progression if you feel up to it.

There's a saying "the donkey doesn't need to whip its own back" meaning the world is out there whipping you into a shape or direction, you don't need to be that harsh on yourself rather kindness is what's needed, and let's be real kindness anit coming for free from nobody except your own damned self.

good work anon
>Even folding paper is too complicated for me.
not true, if it was too complicated you wouldn't be able to complete it 
you're not a failure and this little blue pig proves it

I hate pigs so much it's unreal. Fucking disgusting creatures. Every time I see swine I plan to prepare pork some time in the near future

Why do all the cute girls who share my interests have to be mentally ill? Anyone else have an experience like this?

Dumb larp but ill play along you are a horrible person anon. Making your friend buy weed off you at all, coercing her into sexual favors when she can't. You could've invited her over to smoke a bowl, fucked the shit out of her and talked about healthy relationship dynamics if she said she loved you after. Instead you were one more male in her life that abused her and added to her problems. Hope you die slowly.

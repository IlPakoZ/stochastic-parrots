Remember that girl who used to bully you in school? Well, she only did it because she had a crush on you but didn't have the emotional maturity to express it. You should look her up on social media and try to reconnect. She'll probably go out with you if you ask.

the girl that bullied me had a chad boyfriend that also bullied me. they both made fun of me constantly. her bf punched me in the stomach one time because i got fed up and i cried on the floor. she was there and she laughed and called me a faggot.

i'm in therapy for 5 years now

Anyone here that don't believe really subscribe to the Blackpill(like i believe in the surface level things but barely cause its obv full of white bias and coping mechanism) and the only reason they are here is cause you are unmotivated, insecure, and your lifestyle is normalized too you?

Like i went through a period in my life trying to get pussy and got a okay amount, but it was all so tiresome chasing girls all the time. In a span of 2-3 years though ive had 3 relationships and had sex with 5 girls about half of them being interracial. Rejected 2 one night stands cause insecurity and just didnt feel like it. 

Now i just don't try anymore and have been 'volcel' for a few years. I dont know if thats due to my low T or its just cause i cant be bothered anymore. Or maybe im a high functioning autist.

Anyone know these feels?

the blackpill is extremely true, in the limited frame of reference of being someone who finds it extremely difficult to get up and do anything or talk to anyone or take care of themselves due to untreated depression or other mental illness

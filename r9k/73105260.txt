How can I get friends at 28 online or irl

I am a 28 year old female who cant seem to make any friends online or irl. I am a autistic neet who can not drive I am a loser I guess. I dont use R9k daily more or less once a week but I should use it more. 

I am extremely lonely and really want more friends. I do not want anything beyond a platonic friendship since I am not attracted to men or women. 

If you want a fun friend that is basically always available leave a way for me to contact you. 

I am just longing for my teenage years back I miss knocking on my friends door and going out for scooter rides.

Kill yourself, foid. You are just a failed normie coming to a place where actual outcasts used to be. You are the kind of cunt who would make fun of people on this board but now you are asking for companionship?

I'm a 21 year old girl I wouldn't mind if you are okay with my age that is. I won't be able to chat everyday as I usually keep myself busy with my own hobbies.

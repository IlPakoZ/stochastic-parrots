>cysts in all your lymph node locations
Congratz on having leukemia, a viral infection, or a weird genetic disorder. See a doctor, idiot.

"cysts" are likely enlarged lymphocytes.
they're likely right at the top sides of your groin, probably the two under the angle of your lower jaw, and a bit down the armpit.

could be an allergy to the deodorant, or something else that also has a reaction to the deodorant.

you gotta go to a doctor to find out. could be some auto-immune disorder if you're not sick.

I need it to avoid smelling at work

I shower twice a day because I smell so strongly, once a doctor recommended laser hair removal in the areas claiming it would make the cysts go away and prevent hair from growing in the areas for 2 years. The cysts remained and hair grew back in 2 months.

it's the location of the lymph nodes, and they're the ones that most often get inflamed.

go to the doctor. it's either some really bad viral infection if you're sick, else likely something more serious.

Deodorant is toxic shit that no one should ever use. Completely unnecessary. Same with most soaps, shampoos, and lotions. Dr bronners is OK but even that you should try to use the bare minimum. Also whether male or female you shouldn't remove or even trim pubic or axillary hair.

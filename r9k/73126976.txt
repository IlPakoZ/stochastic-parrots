why does r9k cope with their love of trannies and their desire to have a cute trans gf by being super transphobic?
--- 73126985

Gay men are typically very promiscuous. It is unlikely to be a problem in their relationship. Typically, infidelity is the top reason for relationship breakdown between men.

Oh god just go to any of the threads where you claim to be the gatekeeper of inceldom, protecting them from normies on their behalf, as though you think you're some benevolent being there to save them all, where you claim that anyone who's been shown even the slightest crumb of human kindness from a woman is excluded from being an incel in a definition equal parts imagined and pointless. 
And then you have the audacity to butcher thread after thread after thread with your disgusting "flirting", where you and your boyfriend "teehee xD" at each other over and over, thinking you're eliciting envy from us when really it's pity at best, though far more likely revulsion and annoyance at your nauseating public displays of affection.

There is no greater way to see your own failure at debating than to read your post history, though as you cannot even properly differentiate men and women, you clearly lack the ability to see reality in a way that's not completely warped.

There's not much reason to be very worried about anti-trans bills IMO, given you're already on HRT. I'd be more worried about the place you're prone to anti-trans hatecrimes or harassment when you're outside and not boymodding rather than some conservative state banning HRT for minors/trans women in women's sports.

>Dating people does make you a normalfag, yes, so does having girls or any girl like you.
Any girl liking you. Not loving you. Not having sex with you. Just liking you, even momentarily, even unreciprocated, maybe even unknown to you. You think (and have said multiple times) that ever having had a long distance relationship excludes you from being an incel, when in reality you could function in a relationship online, but once it becomes in person you fail, and never have sex or affection. Some would say you might even remain, involuntarily, sexless. Or celibate, perhaps?

In the context of that post he was talking about having a failed LDR, meaning the girl liked him enough to date him. I mean that type of like. I don't think just having a female friend makes you a normalfag.
>once it becomes in person you fail, and never have sex or affection
Do you think this is common or almost always happens? I'd imagine that'd happen extremely rarely unless your relationship before that point was devoid of any possible sources of affection/warmth.

I'm not going to look further through the archives to find a conversation we had where you said my long distance relationship (that failed when it came to in person) negated my incel status, but I find the fact that you require proof of it to even believe you may have said such a thing to be incredibly dishonest. Then again, your boyfriend even said you cheat at Scrabble, so I suppose it makes sense.
Online relationships are very different to in-person ones, and what works in one might not work in the other. That you think success online but failure in real life is extremely rare genuinely baffles me. Warped reality, once again.
--- 73128657
>>73128632
I can say it again that you're absolutely a normalfag lol. Why can't you find another LDR? One relationship failing doesn't mean you're not a normalfag. Most people fail at least one relationship, obviously.

Well I sort of fell into that one and I've been trying to find another since. Haven't succeeded. Almost like I am, against my own choosing, failing to get sex.

A dryspell? I have never had sex. I am a virgin. I'm not a teenager that's only been interested in sex for a few years with a potential bright future ahead of him, I'm 31 years old, a single online relationship under my belt that failed to result in sex because of my awkwardness and hideousness.
The definition for incel is quite simple, and it's obvious. Just as you don't get to change the definitions for men and women to suit your own liking, neither do you get to claim ownership over incel.
--- 73128853
>>73128831

If by intelligence you mean unmasked autism I admit this is MAYBE possible, but if someone thought those were unappealing traits they shouldn't be going after AGPs
>I'm not ugly
Below average = ugly. You would not be insecure about your looks if they were not below average
>or desperate
You being autistic and ugly also make this hard to believe, I doubt you could get much better + the fact that you started dating right after you met
--- 73128990
>>73128853
I did answer the question, it just takes the mildest amount of reading between the lines to understand that. I am not on a dryspell, and the definition of incel is one who is involuntarily celibate. Of course, a heavily autistic and/or retarded person (such as yourself) could struggle with that, so allow me to help.
Perhaps a person is an incel after not having had sex for a day but wanting it right now? I would say obviously not, and almost all would agree with me. 
Perhaps a person is an incel if they had sex before, but now cannot, due to debilitating mental illness or a physical accident. Debatable, an honest to god debate could be had there.
Perhaps a person is an incel if they have never - ever, not once - had sex, despite trying. I would say obviously yes, and almost all would agree with me.

Lol that's not how that works. You can be a 9/10 but still hate when someone critiques a flaw on you.
Also neither of us are autistic, and she's the most amazing girl I've ever met. I've never wanted to be with anyone as much as with her.
>>73128990
>but now cannot, due to debilitating mental illness or a physical accident
I would say they'd be an incel now.
>despite trying
Is someone an incel if he's a virgin on his 10th date with his gf but she's still delaying sex with him. I wouldn't say so even if he was dumped before they fucked. I think that's similar to your case, basically.
--- 73129085
>>73129053
>Is someone an incel if he's a virgin on his 10th date with his gf but she's still delaying sex with him.
Yes, though he is beginning to move out of it. My situation, however, was nothing like that, because it was all online. And things online are very, very different.

>>73126976 (OP)
>why does r9k cope with their love of trannies and their desire to have a cute trans gf by being super transphobic?
Because its kind of funny to be transphobic and hateful. Women in general have taught me that there isnt really a reason to be nice to them at all.
>i improve my life
>i get a higher income
>i take care fo my body
>girls either like me or they dont
vs
>i dont improve my life
>i maintain the same shit income
>i dont take care of my body
>but i be nice to girls because i want them to like me or have sex with me
There really isnt a reason to be nice to girls or trans girls outside of you feeling personally good which doesnt benefit me or anyone. You want validation like a woman wants validation but you havent earned that from me and dont get it for free.

In general the validation seeking behaviour combined with loser guys doing nothing has caused a feedback loop of miserable men simping for women who will never have sex with them which i dont support not because the women are bad but because it incentivizes men to remain terrible.

Also women are gross

>>73129138
A friend of a friend of a friend joined us for some games one night. Everyone left except me and her, then we kind of hit things off. She was very sexually initiating (despite having only been with 1 other man), I think because she really liked my voice. I also matched her desires in terms of kinks quite heavily.

Online and real life are so different. I'm agoraphobic, so that limits our potential activities to those in my house. She was aware, but not aware of how much that might impact things I suppose. Same goes for my disdain for physical touch due to trauma, despite wanting it desperately. Same goes for my panic attacks, that I was able to downplay online. Not so much in real life. The two are night and day.

As of late, nothing. But before I was making female friends, trying to get to know them better, then ask if they'd like to try something. But knowing my limitations that were so obviously demonstrated in my previous relationship, it was hard. I may well have been subconsciously sabotaging myself so I wouldn't face that again, since I come with so many disclaimers. Who knows.

I wonder what % of /r9k/ robots would actually date a trans girl if their standards weren't essentially identitical to female standards? I'd say a good 50% probably would

It's not a choice for me. I'm a heterosexual, I am attracted to the opposite sex. I feel absolutely no attraction for men. Frankly, I wish I did, I might have a better chance then.

I can assure you, he's cute. Not ugly by any means, he has a beautiful smile, beautiful eyes, and I adore him. Also he's 6' or 6'1, somewhere around there

So he's a giga normalfag that mogs everyone on this board? Where's the insecurity coming from then?

I was bullied a lot in school for my appearance, and didn't fix my appearance until recent years. I'm not flawless-looking by any means and people rip into the appearances of basically anyone on this board, so it doesn't really matter what I look like as long as I'm not a terachad.

If you want my honest opinion...  I was in love with a tranny once but she rejected me  and now I hate them as much as I hate regular women.

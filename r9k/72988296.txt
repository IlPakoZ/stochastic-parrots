NEETed for 17 out of 18 years. My year out was a finance apprenticeship, which I passed, but it became a living hell. TFW it exposed me as an unemployable aspie. Now thanks to outsourcing gutting the Western economy, leaving only the shit underpaid service jobs that are too hellish for me to survive in, I am fully Black Pilled on ever wage-cucking again. Now trying to get an autism diagnosis, so I can be essentially medically retired and not have to go through hell to get my pittance of 'bux. I fucking pray that UBI happens in my non-burgerland country. Kill me.

What did anon mean by this?
--- 72988652
I've been a NEET since 2012 and every day I become more fringe in every way. I've always been isolated, even by my family, and I'm losing all ability to have a connection with any other person as time passes on. I'm opposed to almost everything "normal" people do, and I can't change them since I'm not considered an authority figure like a doctor or scientist. It's pointless to talk to anyone, even on here. I should just put this in a txt file on my desktop instead. No one cares what I have to say anyway, they would rather kill themselves every day and never question what they're told to do

Well, I definitely can't afford to move out on my own and I don't have any friends I could become roommates with. I also have bad socially anxiety, so becoming roommates with someone I don't know, probably won't go very good. I'm also prone to succumbing to depression and NEETing out for months at a time. Although I'm managing to hold down my current job pretty well. Gonna try to get a psych evaluation soon. I want to give meds and group therapy a try. Maybe it'll get me into a position to actually try and get something resembling a career going. Then I can move out

I'm pretty much just waiting until I finally get the courage to kill myself. I spent so long and so many years trying to be normal, to get better, to improve myself, but I always felt miserable. I tried medication, genuinely engaged with therapy, exercised, ate well. From the age of about 14 I've never been able to imagine the future, because I always assume I'll be dead in the next year. Yet I'm still here. I detest myself for being a leech, for never giving anything back.

Stil not entirely buying it. I think that thoughts about suice is just something inherently human. 
All this suffering we have to endure for nothing, suicide is just a logical thought.
The thing is can you find something that makes it worth living through the pain. There were people in Auschwitz that didn't anhero, even though their life was 100 times worse than ours.

as someone who is ugly with a disability i genuinely never expect to be in a relationship or lose my virginity. the things women want in a man are stability, protection, resources, and emotional support. i don't think i can give any of that. i want to kill myself whenever my mom makes me feel like a failure because even if i tried to improve my life and move out i would be just as miserable, if not even more so. cause i would be truly alone and wouldn't even have my parents to talk to. i'd just sit alone in a shitty apartment and slave my life away working. i see no reason to try.

I am not a NEET, as I am employed, but I am a borderline hikki (I leave the house once per month on average for the few things I can't order to my door) and I work a part time job over the internet as a customer service email representative. I spend most of each day alternating between responding to emails and masturbating. I occasionally read books. I'm incredibly alcoholic. That is all I spend my time doing. I have no further hobbies or interests, no internet friends, I visit my family on holidays or rare occasions, and everyone is disappointed in who I have become.

--- 72989794
>>72989581
I can't speak for you, find meaning in the pursuit of finding meaning. 
I just know that after I moved out, my lifestyle didn't change. I kept sitting at home and playing vidya. If it wasn't for covid forcing me to go back with parents, I would have killed myself alone in my appartment.

>>72989628
Me neither. Finished my backlog, or, at least the backlog of games I had in my Steam account, and now the fire is gone. 
I boot up a game to play for 10 minutes and quit back out. I think it's my mind subconsciously telling me that I need to spend the time I have left to actually better myself and not keep running away from my problems, 
The months keep on flying by faster the older I get.
It literally feels like Russia invaded Ukraine just yesterday.
--- 72989860
Am I an incel because my penis is really small? Not sure why it's so small but it just destroys my confidence and has caused me a great deal of depression and anxiety. Asking because it just sort of ruins any concept of sex as something that can be attainable. I actually quite like women and have plenty of female friends who seem to like me back

If they ever ask what I do for a living I just laugh it off and tell them I'm a spy or whatever, or that my apartment is really messy so can we go somewhere else

But yeah, I don't know, I've been thinking of getting a castration so I stop having these sexual desires that I know are just totally impossible to dwal with.

Turning 30 this year. I've been a NEET since I was 18, though I was borderline hikki and a shut-in throughout all of highschool. 
The loneliness is really getting to me. I always told myself I'd kill myself at 30 if things never got better, and honestly for a while they did. I made a lot of friends in an online game I dedicated all of my time to for a good 9+ years. But that game is dying now and now that discord is a thing and algorithms control who I can see or interact with I feel like it's impossible for me to actually meet anyone any more. I've never been good at talking to people, but now I'm at the point where I can't even honestly remember the last time I spent time with another person as a friend and not just game callouts or smalltalk with a delivery person. 
I miss feeling like I belonged somewhere.
I hate being alone all the time so much. I wish I had even a single friend lmao
--- 72990090
>>72989467
Being NEET is probably the only reason I haven't gone insane or killed myself. I also have a lot of free time to read and write, which helps with the isolation and gives me a purpose and ambition I wouldn't get from the regular wageslave lifestyle.

I'm a 26 year old NEET living with my mom. I was kicked out a couple years ago but was told I could move back in recently. Got laid off from my last job and lost my apartment, which was just a room in a house. The roof caved in and the landlord didn't get it checked till he came back from vacation. By then I was sleeping in the freezing cold for three months having to wear a jacket to sleep. Before I got that place, when I got kicked out I was homeless for a month. I was working while sleeping in the shelter. 

right now just trying to get back on my feet applying to jobs frantically. should work out ok, I still have hope. I'm being left alone at home now because everyone feels guilty, and I'll use that till the day I move out. Homelessness ain't it.

I'm feeling like Truman today, I only know that it's not fake because my life isn't exciting enough not to get axed after the pilot episode. Just like he had hope, I lack it.
25, soon 26. Trying to attain education again, just a short 60h certificate on forklift. Worst thing that could happen is that they accept me, I ace it and then one day I die a horrible death while operating it. I also applied for another certificate but this post is already schizo and long enough as is.

I feel as if the wheels of fate are just turning and I have no input on it. As Alex Kister beautifully put it,

I'm a 36 y.o. complete failure.
Never had a job, did a few side jobs that lasted a couple of months or so every now and then.

No GF, obviously, KHV as would be expected.

Can't fucking get a job to save my life, still live with my parents, was never able to move out in my 20s due to no job (also because I was a shut-in).

At age 13 my parents "divorced" (to this day they still share a house), I decided that if my life hadn't improved to a certain point by age 30, I'd off myself.
Surprise motherfucker! I didn't have the balls to do it and I'm still here.

There's no fucking hope I'll be able to improve my life and with the gap in my CV there's no way someone will hire me unless I end up in one of these scams where they end up making you their slave. And then it wouldn't be a job, just work.

Shit, kind know that feel.
Living with my parents, the fucking ceiling in the kitchen and one of the rooms fell off and the wooden beams in the roof were all rotten.
We talked to the landlord, he just told us to get the fuck out off the house until the end of the lease as he wasn't going to renew it. After decades living there and never failing to pay the rent once.

Still, good luck, anonbro.

28. Have a shitty retail job. No friends my entire adult life. No close friends since 11 years old. I only leave the house for work and to run errands. I had to take my car to the mechanic yesterday and dropped it off there. I walked to the shops and just wandered around all day. I saw so many young people, especially girls and all of them seemingly happy. And by young I don't just mean teenagers but all the way up to my age too. I couldn't keep thinking about how I never got to experience even something as simple as a social outing like this with people my own age. Ended up jogging home to wait for the mechanic to call me because I was getting too upset. Felt really good to run and get some sun. Ended up jogging all the way back to the mechanic after he called me to pick up my car too. Ended up feeling good all night and had a lot of energy. Had to stay awake until slightly after midnight because I still felt energetic. Now I'm sad again remembering yesterday.

>>72995661
I have no idea how to make friends or where I would meet people who could become friends with me. I have no idea how to socialize. I have bad social skills. My body language, facial expressions and general demeanor or "off". Also I have an ugly as well as scary face. Women especially are scared of my face. Just the other day an older fat woman literally jumped in fright at the sight of my face in the grocery store when I asked her what the date was today (some milk was on reduced price because it was close to the expiration date and I wanted to know how much time I had to drink it before it goes bad). These kinds of reactions to me are not uncommon. I also want to stress that I have never "gone out". I have no idea what people even do.
Honestly it's more complex than just this stuff too. I wouldn't be able to answer a lot of common questions people ask to new people they meet. "What music do you like", I've never had a taste in music. Never really cared for it. Never got the memo when I was a kid so I never spontaneously developed a taste in music and started following genres/bands/downloading albums. I prefer the peace and quiet.

45. Sperg/adhd. On gibs for health issues, hopefully shouldn't have to work again but who knows, will an hero if so. Still live with mum. The only things I truly get excited over are meeting friends once every few months (because they're semi-normies with lives); occasionally using heroin or meth (only smoke both) but can only do that every few months or become a junkie; and travelling to Thailand when I can save enough which is fucking awesome but doesn't happen very often. Life is boring as fuck the rest of the time. One day my mum will die, I will get stuck into the meth and heroin full-time, and then kill myself - in a weird way I'm sort of looking forward to it. Society is utter shit now; hasn't been anything worth getting excited about, in a long-term sense, for over a decade now.

I like reading. Mostly historical books, not very much fiction. I like old sci-fi TV shows, I started watching them during covid. I'm rewatching DS9 right now. I used to like vidya but I haven't felt like playing any for the last year and a half or so. Same with anime, but I still sometimes watch and old classics from the 80s/90s from time to time.

probably stupid to ask but have you tried joining some sort of community around the things you're interested in? i'm too small brained for a lot of that stuff but i imagine for people into similar hobbies as you that you'd be a joy to talk to, with a lot to offer in discussion or sharing your knowledge!

I don't want bugs terrorizing me this summer, so I'm somewhat determined. I have no real goals outside of that. I am trying to live life day by day. I mean I have goals but I fear that they are unrealistic for myself. If I think too far ahead I just get immense anxiety.

I sure hate getting old.

hey guys, you think I should just take any shitty job at this point? Been a NEET for 7 years and I need money to indulge in copes and degenerate hobbies. What do you guys think? I was basically the worst worker at my last job and was too retarded to keep up. I'm 26 now and can't rely on daddy's money anymore.

>>72996581
yeah. 

if you dont have any money to NEET like you want to you might as well not NEET.

This thread is certified comfy, please make this a recurring general.

being 30+ and seeing all your old relatives get progressively older and older when you make zero progress in life is sobering. whenever my grandma dies in 10ish years having only my parents and sister as immediate family members is going to be weird. i have a mental image of my grandmother when she was younger when i was growing up imprinted in me so seeing her age so quickly in her seventies is kinda fucking me up even though shes the same person personality wise. i can only imagine how its going to be in 20 years when my parents are in their seventies and i see them age quickly. i know i'm only 30 but its just a reminder we do not live very long lives and time really does seem to go by so fast. childhood seems like it was yesterday and at the time same super far away.

Wow your parents and grandparents are young. I am 30 and all of my grandparents are long dead. My parents are closer to your grandparents age.

seeing people in general advance when you dont really sucks. even if you are happy that at least they are doing well...it really sucks.

First time I'm concerned about my mom's health. Had heart palpitations or something I'm really adhd and hard to focus on anything anyone says
My mom loves her kids more than anything and she put up with my shit all these years. She honestly figured one day I'd wake up and get my shit together and she's still hopeful. I hate to disappoint

only my maternal grandmother is left and she is thankfully in great shape for her age besides minor eye issues, the rest are long dead. she had my mom pretty young at 19 and i never knew my maternal grandfather, and my parents had me at 22. i ended up a 30 year old kissless virgin. 

>>72997042
thankfully i'm a shut in and only have contact with my parents, sister, and grandmother. my grandma and parents deaths are gonna really badly fuck me up and i will probably die before my sister despite her being a little older.

I'm sorry the life has been hard for you for this long, but am happy to hear that you still have mom.

>never want to work again because of how everyone treated me
I know it wasn't good, but what would they do?

>>72997693
I had customers make fun of my appearance to my face. My manager would do the same. I found out towards the end that basically everyone that worked there was making fun of me behind my back. Would never have found out if it wasn't for an autistic guy blurting it out. I'll have to get a job this year and I dread it. Having to deal with people and the public when you're extremely ugly just leads to more bad experieneces and cruelty directed towards me.

28 here
>parents pay my rent and bills
>no job since 2017
>have no friends
All in all I am pretty happy I just need to find a job. Shit is stressful since I can't work a cash register (math disability), can't talk on the phone easily much less balance 2 phone lines, can't do heights, not the strongest and have back issues so can't do part picking or ladders
I am thinking of applying to work at a greenhouse or garden center or something what do you guys think? I love plants and keep a yearly garden so I think I would be useful

>>73000568
>math disability
>literally just hitting buttons and scanning shit
What?
>not the strongest and have back issues
I would throw around 40-50 pound boxes all day and move pallets stacked with 20-25 of those boxes and I'm a fucking skeleton.

Ah another day as a NEET crypto chad. What shall I do today? Wander aimlessly? Trip on shrooms perhaps? Coke and hookers? Travel the world? Nah, I'll just curl up in my weighted blankie and watch anime like I always wanted

i don't think i'd ever be rich enough for that and i only get my disability NEETbux living in canada. i would have to online date some desperate 3rd world girl and have her move here or something which probably wouldn't work out.

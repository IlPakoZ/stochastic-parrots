My sister had three rabbits.
Two died from eating the paint on the wall
One of them died because of an eye infection that made them permanently tilt their head 90 degrees. Eventually it lead to the infected eye getting infected more and she died.
They all had a maximum lifespan of 2 years. Don't know if that's just rabbits or my sister being retarded, but it fucked her up beyond belief.

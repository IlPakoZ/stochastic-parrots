Poker is a game of skill with an element of chance. When you get one outed what is that but bad luck? It can also go the other way sometimes, it's just variance.

I don't give a shit about his fake youtuber apology video, he was screeching about tyrants as he was getting arrested. They're all the same, just miserable cunts too ugly to be successful youtube grifters like Jake Paul or whatever so they spend their time trying to bully random people. If they gave a shit about your rights they would focus on something that was actually important and under threat, the filming in public thing just allows them to farm easy content for spiteful cripples like you.

Still it comes down to money with women. If you can't afford to take them out every weekend, you're not really desirable to them. It might be different if you grew up with them but as an adult, the bar is higher. Plus not having a car and your own place makes things even worse. It's not just about hobbies.

--- 73115801
>>73115749
The reasons are there. It's knowing I could only do things by myself. The fact is unless you already have lots of friends and connections your chances of finding love are very slim. A lot of women in the workplace will be taken.

Large swathes of society are being priced out of basic human necessities such as food, heating and shelter by rampant unchecked greed. Even working a full time job is no guarantee of security.

The ownership class need to read a history book and remember what happens when people go from having nothing to gain to having nothing to lose.

Caring people do not stalk strangers online for a start. And the fact that you refuse to take any responsibility for scaring her and ruining her hobby proves my point about how you just blame everyone else for your problems. Genuinely the whole world isn't out to get you and the sooner you realise your problems are YOUR problems the more likely it is you will have the agency to get your shit together.

That's a lot of doss, be sure to take a break or you'll be too tired for your main doss hahaha.

Fockin 'ell laddinghams, what a shitshow this was

Fucking girlfriend definitely has bipolar disorder or sommet

She suffered yet another paranoid episode while on call earlier, followed immediately by a nervous breakdown out of nowhere complete with crying and sobbing to me on the phone - That, or she really knows how to fake an extremely convincing one...

For now she apparently doesn't want to meet up again at all, so i'm just gonna wait and see if she'll make up her mind at some point in the near/mid-term future. 

Maybe/probably she's already cheating on me with some rando chad in her home cunt and keeps psychologically projecting this on to me; Basically most everything she accuses me of/says she suspects me of pulling she's pulling herself by the looks of it, it's that femoid ""logic"" at work here and all.

But yeah, there's definitely no pleasing this woman no matter what i do or don't; At the same time i will not kill the relationshit thougheverbeit - That one's going to be completely on her if she decides to do so (and yes, she'd blame me for it too of course since womanoids are biologically incapable of taking responsibility for their own - mostly irrational and erratic - actions) 

Fucking rain started pouring as well almost at the exact same time she started sobbing on me, lol. What a complete fucking shitshow really

im 22 and feel like its over
ive been fucking anxious and depressed all my life and the only reason i didnt kms when i was a kid was because i had hope that id suddenly become a cool skater emo boy with a cute emo gf and become a rockstar or some shit like that, kept on holding out hope that it'd happen for years but it never did because i was an autist that fucking hated himself and obviously autism + self hatred = no charisma and no drive to put myself out there
now that im graduating uni in a month i wanna fucking kms because i feel that all the chances i had to turn this shit around have passed me by and now it's impossible for me to live the life i wanted
no friends, khv (got hugs tho), no parties, no meaningful personal growth
i almost unalived myself when i was 16 and 19 because i fucking hated life so much, but hung in there merely because i thought id become cool and get an emo gf on my dick somehow, should have just gone ahead with it then lol
i don't wanna hang out with adults and do boring adult shit, i wanna be a zoomer. i wanna go skatepark and start a band and fall in love with mentally ill adhd girls
mid 20s women are incompatible with me, too much baggage and expectations of having my shit together, im basically not attracted to anyone over 21 kek, miss me with that shit lol

i feel my only option is to larp as if im 18 again and give myself another slate
there are scholarships i can apply for that let me go to uni in japan/korea/taiwan for free, or i could go to uni for free in argentina
the competition is hard but it's my only shot. i only have two chances to make it work before im too old to qualify but i feel this is my only ticket out of here
i know im weird for trying to be a zoomer in my mid 20s and somewhat sleazy for trying to date 18 and 19 year olds in my mid 20s but this is all i have, this is all i fucking have and the only thing i ever fucking stayed alive for
and if i can't get this then i'll kms

Don't be stupid. You just sit here getting called a cunt all day and night because you like drumming up attention for them and more importantly for yourself.

I'm a full time dosser mate. Nobody hires long term neets. I don't really like the thought of supporting Chads and Stacys. Working without ever having love is brutal.
--- 73127529
Liked the part too where she actually accused me of hacking into her whatsapp (???) "because it showed some connected device that wasn't there before" (?????)

Fucking lol really. She also keeps putting tape over her smartphone's camera lenses "so no one can spy on her" or sommet

The woman really has some sort of bipolar-paranoid disorder she either doesn't know about or that she's hiding from me on full fockin purpose

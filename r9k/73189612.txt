have you tried asking your dad (literally a genetic clone of yourself who managed to get a gf) on how to get a gf?
--- 73189628
you retard, you are half of your mom's subhuman genes. ugly women have no problem reproducing, whereas short and ugly men can't reproduce. ugly women make ugly incel sons. simple as.

your dad won't have any idea how to navigate the world with your mom's short ugly incel genes.

yeah back in 6th grade or something. he barely gave me nonsense boomer advice.
wouldn't apply anyway since dad was a chad. mom always used to talk about how she decided to have kids with him just by looking at him, never mind the fact that he was a complete jackass back in his early 20s, i'm talking bar fights, drunk driving and reckless spending.

He was very fit when he met my mother. He also visited tons of clubs. He said something along the lines of "if you want an ugly woman, shower her with attention. If you want a hot one, ignore her. She's not used to that."

My Dad told me that he's old and he doesn't know how he would do it in modern times. He said that he probably has autism too, and if he didn't grow up in boomer times where he was forced to socialize constantly, he would be just as fucked as me. He was a college professor who married one of his students.

I often ask myself what the fuck my parents were thinking when they decided to bring me into the world 

>hmmm were super fucking POOOR 
>I have a severe addiction 
>my family all excommunicated me due to my addiction and problems
>I have no family
>wow we are existing in the perfect conditions lets have a child he will grow up go to an Ivy League college and become a high earning salary man and we can use him as our retirement fund he may even become the next president

AT LEAST 50 percent are accidents according to various stats. 
Most parents put little to no thought when it comes to having kids. Ideally there should be requirements and standards to allow people to raise kids but sadly that won't happen.

My dad is a spineless doormat who constantly enables my abusive manipulative narcissist mom and lets her walk all over him, and they both tried to teach me to do the same when I "have a wife someday"

Even if I was straight, my dad is the last person I would ask

Unfortunately, I take after my mom. She literally said 0 words on her first few dates with my dad but he kept going out with her anyway. She has cursed me to a life of loneliness

My dad was an aspie bookworm skelly and managed to score my mom, who was a legal loli who looked like an actress from a 1930's movie. Naturally I asked him how he did it.

He said that he met her at a "Model UN" for smart high school students and wrote her letters (like US mail letters) until she fell for him. Apparently no one else paid any attention to her and she really looked forward to checking the mailbox every day for his letters.

I asked him if that would have worked in the modern era, when no one writes letters and 300 guys a day were sending her direct messages and buying her stuff from her Amazon wish list. (I've seen their old pictures, and every pedo in the US would have been buying her stuff.) He thought about it for a minute, and then laughed and shook his head and said No.

My dad would ABSOLUTELY be an incel in the current year.

Haven't spoken to my father in over a decade and he's probably in jail at the moment. If you have a normal, supportive male role model in your life then you have zero excuses for being an incel.

He died in March. He had just called me a few weeks before telling me how he planned to move back into town to be closer to me.

My literal boomer dad refused to ever answer any question I ever had even when I was like 4 years old.
His running joke was saying "look it up" to anything I ever asked (and some of this timeframe was even before we had the first early mainstream shitty dial up internet service so looking it up meant walking to the town library).
I've actually had a couple gfs in spite of this kind of parenting rendering me socially retarded, but I don't have any idea how he approached my mom and I know whatever he did it was different from my successful approaches of A) begging for a gf on /r9k/ years back and getting one to respond who lived near me and B) doing online dating going out with 10 different girls and accidentally meeting one girl weird enough to put the moves on me instead of vice versa.

Genes have a role in mental illness predisposition and all of that but it's a minority compared to how the environment where you grow up shapes your mind.

Just because your father shares 50% of your DNA that doesn't mean his mind works as your mind. He grew up in a different time and in a different environment.

Most of our fathers would be Incels if they were in their 20s and 30s today.
My dad is 72 and together with my mom for over 45 years. He is a shy conflict avoidant agreeable Beta and I didn't really realized that until I was in my late 20s. My dad would have 10.000 posts on incels.is if he would have been born in the 90s.

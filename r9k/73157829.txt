Verse 1:
I posted some memes on 4chan late at night
Thought I was anonymous, out of sight
But then Pepe the Frog came to town
And he shut me down, oh how he shut me down

Chorus:
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won

Verse 2:
I tried to troll, to stir up some hate
But Pepe the Frog was there to moderate
He said "we don't do that here, my friend
So you better log off and start over again"

Chorus:
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won

Verse 3:
I thought I could outsmart this little green guy
But he's got a following that's way too sly
They swarmed me with memes, made me laugh out loud
And I realized then, I was just one of the crowd

Chorus:
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won

Verse 4:
Now I'm a changed man, with a different view
I don't post hate, don't stir up trouble too
And when I see Pepe, I nod with respect
'Cause he's the king of the memes, and I won't forget

Chorus:
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won
I fought the frog and-a, the frog won

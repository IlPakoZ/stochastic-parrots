From the dawn of humanity till the 1800's
>Life in a single community ( 10-100 people)
>You will spend your entire life with these people
>Play with them, fight with them, eat with them, love them, have children with them
>If you have a problem with them your only choice is to work it out or fucking die

After the invention of mass transport 
>Life without a community in swarm of thousands of other community less people
>The only long term relationships you'll naturally make are with you family and other kids you meet in your childhood
>If you don't like these people you can just leave and find new people
>This becomes learned behavior
>Whenever you entire a relationship and it doesn't go well just leave and pluck out the next rando from the aether

The core problem of the modern human.

This is true and then made even worse by things like dating apps and social media. Man is designed to live in clans of 100-120 people and lives today in a world where they are competing and rubbing shoulders with thousands or millions.

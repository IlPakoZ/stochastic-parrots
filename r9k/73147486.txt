First year of college complete, I talked to absolutely nobody.
How the fuck do I fix this? I know I want socialization and friends but I do not know where to start. What events/activities should I partake in? What is a good time to talk to someone? Please help :(

You should have lived in a dorm for your first year. Thats how I made friends

I just made acquaintances by happenstance, like just by chance I would see the same people repeatedly over and over because we had the same interests, took the same classes/were in the same major, hung out in the same places, etc.
I'm not a chad by any means, I didn't keep up with any of those people after I graduated, but at least I got some socialization

You're just out there on your own and it's up to you, the whole point is you're already prepared. Already thinking about terrorists though I see.

Tell women you complain about >tfw no gf while posting Jihadi John on an incel forum. Women love that

Yeah at some point you have to accept the reality- if you change your environment and social circle several times and you don't fit in any of them- then the only common denominator is YOU, the issue lies with you not some lack of luck

im going to community college here and the same thing happened to me, ive not really made any friends in college, is it because its a community college and not a university?

im graduating this summer and i never talked to anybody except my roommate and lab partners. my first year was online so i never lived in a dorm like most freshmen are required to. you're ngmi unless you join a club or some organization. i'm assuming you don't enjoy anything enough to join a club about it though. how about table tennis club or something? it wont be that fun but at least you will talk to people and you might get good at table tennis. at the start of next year join your table tennis club or tabletop rpg club or whatever you think is mildly interesting. don't expect it to be fun and just treat it as an obligation.

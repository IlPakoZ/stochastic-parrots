I miss the simpler times. Scarcity creates value.

When I started using a computer in 2001, just having a file was amazing.
An actual file of something.
Zoomers have no idea what this feeling feels like.

I remember having a 140p video file of an Indian wedding on my computer as a kid
 Watched it all the time because it was an actual digital video holy shit

Yeah it has become too sterile and "safe", they made it retard proof and therefore boring just like real life.

Scarcity creates value. When you have a few dozen funny images you cherish them. When there's several terabytes of "sorta funny" reaction images on Google Images who fucking cares? It's like having cut rubies vs old seashells from the beach.

Factor in that 90% of today's internet humor was spawned from memes we already saw here 12-16 years ago and everything you see feels derivative and done-already. Everything's been watered down to appeal to trout-tier attention span consumers with terrible senses of humor. It's one big ocean of "meh".

The internet since the 2000s has changed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitatively, the democratization of technology opened the internet up to phone posters, which lowered the overall quality of content generally through massification. Qualitatively the web changed through the rise of social media, which replaced the previous relatively more decentralized WWW from before. Now there's just massive websites with a mass of users.

AI has nothing to do with it. The internet got shitty years before 2016 even.

No scarcity is just scarcity for the sake of shit being more difficult. It is in no way truly tied to any sense of quality.

The internet went downhill when normies and their smartphones gained 24/7 access to it. The smartphone simultaneously ruined both cyberspace and real life.

>fucking retard is nostalgic about the internet
The internet sucks, gaming sucks, smartphones suck, 4chan sucks, screens suck. Life pre internet and pre smartphone is something feel nostalgic about.

I like the connectivity and information internet brings. I can look at and learn about places I can never afford to go to. Pre-internet I would be have to purchase a picture book with descriptions limited to very few number of people's experiences and perspective. Now I can learn everything about it. Culture,flora,fauna,climate, geography, history and like even communicate easily with the people form there. Really satisfies the wanderlust.

No you dont. You like stupid memes and talking to other trannies on discord

Which was amazing and trustworthy

They were actual professionals, now anyone can post anything. I hate how low IQ criminals are starting up "news sites" and pretend to be journalists.

I actually lived pre-Internet and it was a better time.
It's weird reading you 15-year-olds post about how everything "must have been horrible in the past".
I've lived in both worlds and I'd go back in a heartbeat. 
In 1995, women didnt google me and do a background check before going out with me.

This sounds like nostalgia and a (you) problem for being an incel. I have also lived in a pre-internet world. It was not so popular or even accessible before smartphone explosion for most people. Not everyone wanted to sit in a pc whole day to listen to permanently online weirdos .

Pic related.
You have no idea how much people live in denial about why they like the Internet

>>73111145

You dont deserve a reply.

How is it my safe space when only thing I do there is either search for random places and philosophies sometimes or lurk this shithole where everyone is extremely hostile? You aren't making sense? Do you think everyone who likes internet uses Tiktok or shitcord?

Good. It kept the cockroaches out. A person who was "incapable" of using the Internet before some retard facilitation device doesnt deserve to use it.
>Not everyone wanted to sit in a pc whole day to listen to permanently online weirdos .
So you fags now claim it's normal and healthy to sit all day smudging a glass screen with your greasy fingertips because it's "SoCiaLiZinG".
Just because women do it, doesnt mean it's normal. Stop following the women. Smartphoning is a feminine trait.

Your whole problem is in your mind. It's not because of your jaw, your balding head, your height, and any other blackpill cause. It's because you don't EMBRACE your flaws. If you started smiling, having fun, and opened yourself, girls would be much more receptive.
--- 73077371
No one thinks that manlets or even slightly short skinny men have a masculine presence. If a manlet or otherwise dysgenic man is the life of the party then he probably spent decades perfecting his socialization, knowing exactly what to say or do. He still has to perform the monkey dance to pull women, and for many men the juice is not worth the squeeze when chads height and face squeezes for him. If tall and handsome man and a short and average man have around the same amount of charisma, the chad wins 99/100. Maybe you will find exceptions, but thats just it. Exceptions.

I come back to this board every now and then and it blows my mind how distorted people's views about reality are. To be clear, you aren't entirely wrong in a vacuum, but that isn't a reflection of real life at all. Statistics or the aggregate of how people act mean absolutely nothing in real life in the same way that statistics mean nothing when an athlete steps up to bat or shoot a free throw. I have traveled all over the world and all over the US and you'd be shocked to see what kind of girls guys are able to pull, guys who you wouldn't think much of because you've warped your world view into thinking every woman wants gigachad.

Far fewer women are into gigachad than you might think. If you actually talk to women about what they want in a man very rarely do they talk about physical attributes, with height being an obvious exception but hey, what can you do. Something that a lot of women won't usually own up to outright is that while a lot of them would probably consider hooking up with a "Chad" type, many of them don't view them as boyfriend material and don't like to feel like they're competing with being "the looks" in a relationship. Women will happily take a 7 or a 7.5 who they know "knows their place" in the relationship. Women are usually getting off to how hot they know they are during sex anyways (hence why they like when guys are verbal with them). Also unless you have a literal micropenis cock size isn't that important either.

>>73077736
Whatever you say dude, I don't know. I don't think you're living in the same reality I am. Often times if you talk to women they'll tell you what they actually want/like, the real cope is ignoring what they're saying and creating this idea in your head that they all prefer 6'5 gigachad with a foot long cock and always will. Maybe that's a fixation of yours to create this strawman chad figure who creates a reason to just give up before you even try. Every single girl I've ever talked to has either told me size doesn't matter, that they don't like cocks that are too big, shape>size, or strangely enough that their next lays were with guys who were just average but knew what they were doing and the girl liked how she felt with him. All in all I think you'd be surprised how much happier you'd be if you just ignored all these preconceived ideas you have about dating/women/"Chad/Stacy" and just talked to them as individual people.

Of course there's some truth to it, the same way there is truth to statistics in the aggregate but again, all of those things can go completely out the window in real life. Walk up and talk to girls, it's really not that hard once you get past yourself. I flirted with three girls in person in the last week and got two dates out of it. You don't have to be the most attractive guy she's ever seen, but being self-assured and confident enough to approach a girl in the real world is a big turn on for most girls these days, especially if you can have a short conversation. You aren't competing with Chad every time you interact with a woman. You aren't even competing with the "idea" of Chad. I really think it helps to get out of your own head a little bit and just live in the real world. Sure there are times where Chad mogs some normal or 7.5 looking dude but what are you going to do? I'm not going to sit here and say I'm not biased about women's appearances either, I only hit on/flirt with girls I find attractive too so it'd be a bit hypocritical of me to criticize women for liking chad even if I did see things that way because realistically we all prefer "Stacy" anyways. Guys are often really critical of women for being shallow when I find that we (myself included) are usually more to blame for this. The bar for being a good looking dude is set very fucking low, much lower than you guys think. You get a warped view of reality scrolling through IG but if you're in shape and have a good haircut you're already 7.5. Women don't view looks the same way we do.

Thank fuck someone points this out. People don't understand that personality and mood is not some easily malleable thing, just because it's not as tangible as something like your skin or height or face, without scanning your brain.

Glad someone mentioned this as well. People will come up with any reasons they can to blame the sufferer and protect their worldview, because the reality that nobody gets to choose, and nobody has any control, and awful things can simply happen to anyone, and no actually deserves any of it, is so terrifying that most people can't accept it.
Or they just have no empathy and want to shut down your complaining with bullshit "advice", or they want to make themselves feel superior because they "chose" to do the right things, when really they were just born with well-adjusted genetics. Any of the above.

This is exactly how it works. It's called economics. You're in the sexual market and are competing with the highest quality mates, except that there can be redundancy in demand, which basically means chad can afford to juggle multiple women at a time.

To my point earlier, every guy can be at least a "7" the way we think of looks. To be fair I'm 6'0 tall and have blonde hair and blue eyes, to what degree that makes a difference who knows. But it wouldn't make any difference if all I did was complain about chad and play league of legends all day. Maybe if it's as bad as you make it sound you guys should accept some of the blame for not even trying to get out there and compete or even just put yourself out there. I failed miserably with girls for over a decade, it's part of the process with getting better at anything. I love how even when someone with actual experience and a different perspective comes here to try to give you a different outlook you just attack like white bloodcells.

This is absolute nonsense. As usual, it dramatically underestimates the diversity in the "low status male" population.

Are there a lot of painfully shy introverts? Yup. But one of the most common, most classic personality types in this group is the guy who says, "I was the class clown."

The class clown archetype sticks his neck out, and cracks the joke or says the thing that no one else is willing to say. Everyone knows who he is; he's not hiding in the corner or trying to be anonymous.

And a large number of those guys end up here, because as far as normie girls are concerned, they are nothing more than dancing monkeys or court jesters. Their "confidence" gets them nothing and their extroversion gets them nothing and they can "embrace their flaws" all they want and it will make no difference. Everyone remembers them and everyone vaguely kinda likes them, but no girl wants them, almost invariably because the class clown is almost always funny looking. Sometimes he's a skelly; sometimes he's a Chris Farley type. He's good enough to keep around for entertainment, and he's good enough to friendzone, but he's not good enough to date unless he makes it onto Saturday Night Live.

If 10% of below-average-looking guys are able to get chicks, you will see a HUGE number of examples of the phenomenon as you travel the world.

But that leaves the other 90%. If that other 90% thinks to themselves, "I can't get chicks because I am not good looking," they are absolutely correct, because there are only so many seats on the bus and they didn't get one.

that's rough, buddy. such a different experience from my friend, sorry to hear about that. if it's any consolation, you didn't waste your time or become frustrated with a lack of result. i hope what i said didn't upset you further, bro. do you still have some good mates though? are your friend's girlfriends nice to you at least?

Me too bro. That's why I wrote it. Because I know.

Not everyone here is a NEET. Not everyone here is a hikki. Not everyone here is introverted and shy. Not everyone here is depressed.

In the current year, you don't need to be all of those things to be undateable. Having one significant enough physical flaw is entirely sufficient. Mine is that I'm an Auschwitz skelly.

>lmao fucking retard just eat more

I've tried protein shakes, adding a 4th meal time, etc.

Calories in / Calories out is indisputably true, but I have a very hard time taking in enough calories to gain weight. I also have a problem on the calories out side where the more I eat, the less I *sleep*. Sometimes as little as 2 hours a night. As I take more in, I just burn it off.

My doctor says not to worry, and that I should like being the way that I am because I'm very healthy and have low blood pressure. And that "in a few years" my metabolism will eventually slow down slightly. That doesn't really help me a lot right now, though. And it probably won't help me then, either, since by then it will be too late.

Women aren't willing to get to know me, so it is impossible that its my personality keeping me back. Personality isn't even part of the equation, women decide they won't interact with me the second they see me.

That's odd. Do you know why you sleep less? IBS? Heart burn? People usually sleep more after eating more.
Kind of a long shot, but have you tried just getting junk calories like soda or those sugar Starbucks drinks? Or maybe taking up drinking alcohol? Liquid calories are the main cause of obesity in America.

This is the first true post on this board. While its more complex than that, embracing your flaws, being able to take a joke on your expense, having a sense of humour and generally not being a total retard helps

nta but I have IBS and stomach acid issues
Eating more raises my stomach acidity giving me cramps while asleep. 

The best fix was eating a light meal with no acidic foods, and an antacid drink, before bed

Yeah man think about all the times that Chad "embraces his flaws" and "takes a joke at his expense". You're a fucking retard. Laughing at being insulted is the most cuckold thing a man can do, short of literally being cucked.

The sleep issues happened in the phase when I had staggered meal times to have 4 full meals a day. My "dinner" was at 9:30 and after that I would often be up until 3 or 4 and then get up at 6. Day after day after day.

I do drink alcohol - but not alone. And that limits the number of times a week I can feasibly drink it.

>Say things
>People laugh...WITH you, and AT the thing you are joking about
>"You aren't actually funny!"

Only by the "A sense of humor is whatever Chad does" metric of funny, bro.

Why do we tell ugly people it's all in their head? Trust me no one likes you freaks. It's not all in your head. Your paranoia is perfectly justified. Normies really do want to get rid of you. They spit in your food. They call the cops on you just for being in public. I used to be friends with these people. I've seen them do it. Normies and NPCs are programmed to tell ugly people the reason they don't have girlfriends is because of their body language, confidence, attitude, and clothes. They'll tell you the only thing holding you back is yourself. They'll tell you no one thinks you're ugly and it's all in your head. Then they'll call you ugly behind your back 2 minutes later when you leave the room. Why do they lie so blatantly?

Based and truepilled, the lookism/doomer pill is a self fulfilling prophecy. People don't want to be around a downer. If that sounds reductionist to the point of being idiotic, consider for a second that it might be true. Think about how fucking retarded women are, then realize they simply want to feel good. Literally jus tbe fun to be around and you win.

I've spent so much time on here just trying to encourage people to make friends and stop doom posting all day, but you can't help people that don't want to be helped. They won't accept that things can be better, because then they would have to accept responsibility for whether or not they try. 

My final attempt: Stop focusing on getting laid all the time and go have some fun. Find a social, in person hobby if you can. Expand your social circle. Dress in a way that makes you feel good about yourself. Stop listening to incel shit because they want other people to be miserable and vent with them. A random unsourced graph is not the end of the world. Women are people. Most people don't like listening to rants, so keep the /pol/ shit to yourself. The End.

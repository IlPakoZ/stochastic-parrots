don't get me started on this. take hitler as an example:
>tomboy gf or perpetuate the 3rd Reich to the 21st century?
his answer is written in history books and is probably why you are on /r9k/ making this post.

with a tomboy gf you are filled with the nostalgia of hanging out with "true friends" from back when they existed (middleschool times). all the extra drama a normalwhore brings disappears. she can take care of herself, and you if you ever need it. someone is rude to you in front of her? trust me she is no having all of that that. takes a large 20kg rock and fends off any attacker at any time. she will replace the sun if it happens to explode.

I had female friends when I was 7 that would beat other kids thatd pick on me. Theyd also bully me for being a mommas boy. Sadly shit happened.

My mom was also like that when she was in elementary, shed beat up guys who picked on my uncle.

A tomboy gf sounds fun, but I doubt they're for me.
She'd probably get fed up with how stupid and lazy I am.
--- 72994444
okay if you niggers are so obsessed with tomboys then are you looking for them in real life? or are you sitting on your ass inside and thinking you'll meet one online?

I actually am a tomboy, I'm trying to learn how I can make that a marriage-able quality
--- 72994465
>>72994417
touching story anon. if there was a waiting line for obtaining trophy tomboy gfs i would let you skip in front of me and make all the nerds in the back mad, cause that's how it be.

--- 72994589
>>72994465
you're never going to find one on the internet. online socialization is for fags and attention whores. go outside.

vidya, camping, fishing, donating to wikipedia when they ask cuz I use them so much for studying prehistoric life, and I'm writing &amp; illustrating a speculative evolution journal from the perspective of a survivor of an Earth ship crash-landing on a planet that then gets blacklisted for intergalactic travel, so the marooned astronauts do there best to survive on their own without outside contact, I like to build model houses out of printer paper boxes
you know what, I'm not sure if I actually do any tomboy shit, this actually just kind of sounds like little odd things
I guess I do tend to wear the ol oversized hoodie, track shorts &amp; converse look though

ey, language ambiguity a bitch. good luck out there retard (affectionately)
--- 72994778

That all sounds great. You don't need to call yourself a "tomboy" or use any other label to fit yourself into a neat little box. Just be yourself and people will like you, and someone will love you.

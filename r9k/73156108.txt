When did you niggas realize that all this "positive thinking" bullshit is just some garbage invented to distract you from the real world and the real problems we face.

Just take the blackpill and stop acting like retards, it'll be a lot easier.

yeah, and the real world and the real problems we face are a distraction from your inner world which you can mold to be your own exactly as you like.

The fact that you immediately assume I was talking about no pussy/bussy shows me that you're projecting you own inability to get laid

living is about coping and you will do it one way or another. the only way for you to stop coping is dying

nah, its just the standard complaint on this board for gay retards. and you mention "blackpill" in the OP so its the first thing that comes to mind. stop trying to pretend you had some other problem in mind, you really didn't. I also didn't just say no pussy I also said love. If you have an innate desire to be loved you're a fag, no ifs ands or buts you are a pussy.

I've been at this point for years now, but I can't "think positively" anymore, it just feels like trying to force myself to believe in lies. I wouldn't say I'm a pessimist, I just can't get myself to look at the world and hope for the better outcome, or at myself, I feel resistant to positive self-talk. Maybe it's the apathy at work here.

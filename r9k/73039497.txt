Girls have so many options that yes even one mistake will completely fuck you. Women are insane and its why Ive seen the same whores grow old on tinder

If she isn't ok with accepting you being passionate about a subject you enjoy, then she isn't the right one, you'll find the right girl for you one day, don't give up Anon.

It went great with a girl for me like 3 days then she up and ghosted.
Just have to move on and find a girl that actually is genuine.
Side note, any girl that says they can't get a bf?
They can and do get offers from men, but they ghost them
And then complain they are femcels. 

t. Gave some femcels a chance, they all showed interest for a few days then ghost randomly.

Basically, yes.
This fat 60yo ghosted me, even though she suggested that she was DTF.
I tried to set a meet, which she initially went along with until she petered out.
I'll never know what I did 'wrong'. Sadly, even these women have too many options.

i'm seriously starting to consider that women just lead guys on to boost their own egos, which honestly seems pretty obvious at this point. Anyway we need to take away their rights unironically

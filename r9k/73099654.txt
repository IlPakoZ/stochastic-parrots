How do you guys listen to ASMR?
I really want to get into it because I feel lonely, but I get embarrassed and shut it off within the first couple of seconds every time.
Not even pervy stuff, I just want cutesy romancy shit.

I love ASMR, but the romance shit makes me cringe so hard and I can never bear more than 5 seconds of it. I mainly watch male ASMR.

Its not really made to make you feel love but rather to recreate the weird sounds or habits that used to give us inexplicable tingles when we were young
Which is why I only watch men do it

I used to listen to asmr to fall sleep  because I was desperately lonely , and it was honestly just depressing as fuck. The shame I'd feel after a video was also way too akin to post nut shame, when you realize how pathetic and degenerate you are. I'd rather be a failure than pretend to not be one.

i watch japanese vtuber asmr, i also bought myself a sleeping mask with earphones built in it so lets see how that goes. 
also, I don't listen to asmr because i'm lonely, i do it because it makes me sleep like a baby

i used to listen to vienna teng while falling asleep. she plays piano and i found her on youtube on a naruto doujin video. that or something supernatural like welcome to nightvale.

i typically can't listen to asmr because i want the real voice of someone i love. so i tend to count backwards from 100 instead.

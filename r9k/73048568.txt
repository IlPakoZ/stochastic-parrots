Sorry this world has made you feel like this, but it is not true. Plenty of people would be happy to enjoy your company. I felt just as bad as you because of my medical condition but the pills did help. Go talk to a doctor give them pills a good shot whenever you feel like you have no other choice. I think 3 months later you'll catch yourself being truly happy again.

Story of my life. I don't know what it is about me that causes such disinterest. It's like I'm shadowbanned from life.

I make well written posts with effort put in to them and nobody even reads them. Usually the posts I put the most thought into will be the last ones in a thread before it dies.
Robots only respond to racial ragebait and porn.

Psychological designation is just the Jews way of telling the normies they are correct in being conformists and provides the npc normies a platform to exile the non-conformist or outsider that might not be how they expect them to be. 
Yolo - rise above bros
ADHD, PTSD, autism &amp; etc. etc. didn't even exist before modern bullshit para-scientism and you know what?! Humanity existed for hundreds of thousands of years before psychology and will exist long after it is forgotten yarp!
fuck normies yooo wuuuuut

Interesting to hear other people's experiences being different like this.

I am very polarizing. Throughout school being very witty and funny made people like me, but moreover I had the charisma to draw people to my side who care and listen to my views and advice. But within any group setting there will be some number who cannot stand me, and cannot resist expressing their displeasure.

I know the game well enough to draw people in, but inevitably my autism starts showing. I used to stick with being a weirdo hanger-on in school, but once I noticed it happening in college, when I had gained some self-respect, I just said fuck it and stayed alone. Apparently nobody wants me around, and I'm not gonna beg for scraps of anyone's company.

Hello OP I am also in the same situation as you , I chat in a group of loner incels yet they still ignore me or treat me like a lolcow and it makes me feel bad. I try to make my best to offer one of them IRL friendship (same city) but he always refuses.

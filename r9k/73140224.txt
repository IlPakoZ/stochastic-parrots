How do you nofappers do it? By the end of the week, my balls start feeling sore and heavy and I have to empty out a couple massive loads.

The only thing that gives me enough motivation to not fap is if I'm currently dating or have a fwb situation going on. If there's no woman in my life, I'm gooning hard. I usually fap less when I'm drinking heavily too.

Video games and lifting unironically. 
The rage starts to set in after 5 days of no fap. Great motivation to lift. Its no wonder ancient civs deprived us of pussy while working or in the army to get results back then. Funny how one gender can function better without genital contact than the other for longer periods of time lol

Permanent nofap is retarded, it's natural to masturbate at least once a week. That heavy feeling is your body returning to baseline horny levels, don't punish yourself for no reason.

Are you edging? If you're edging you're not nofapping, and that's why you're getting sore balls. I have a zero tolerance approach towards edging. Even a single intentional stroke = hard fail.

Just start by jacking off once a week and do it less and less from there, you don't gotta go cold turkey.

Low test, androgen blockers, and lots of estrogen. Ssris also help. Pic unrelated

People with geniuine depression dont have the energy to fap. I didnt fap for 5 whole months after my dad died, I was too worried how to not go homeless now that there's no one to support me, zero skills and dad literally dead forever. I only started fapping again after life eased up on me a bit, I was so stressed I barely could get hard for 5 whole months. They were distructive doe (insomnia, alcoholism, crying, even hair went gray)

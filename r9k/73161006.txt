Not you as a person but yes there is a kabal of pedophile weirdo ass politicians that are hell bent on killing all free thinkers like me and you. Not just far right of liberals(actual liberals not the communist ones) because we are not attached at the hip to their system. The minute you start thinking its all ok is the minute they have won over you personally.

Glad you got out of the headspace. Just watched a friend of mine take the final plunge into this madness earlier this year after a buildup of a couple years. What were the specific delusions you had, and how did you back out of it?

I was being harassed and stalked by Twitter people through 4chan as a joke and eventually by the diplomatic circles in the news and twitter. Classical "self-reference", but really.
They killed my creativity and owe me big time and they stopped because it got stale. I hate them. Mostly because I understood myself and life as possible without enemies but they really don't give a fuck and are willing to kill and die over their way of being. It is just how they roll...(not talking about weed cigarettes)
They are so unashamed and abrasive I need a psychotic episode to make peace with the knot in consciousness having had the displeasure in interacting with them has given me. They completely killed my creativity and took a lot of joy from me.

I have no idea what I am posting anymore, here goes nothing.

Interesting. Sounds very similar to how my friend was talking when she finally went mindbroke. In her case, she thought (still, I assume, thinks) that children on a Minecraft server were making sockpuppet accounts on a small off-brand socmed site harass her there, so kind of similar to the Twitter-to-4chan thing I guess. She also thought a meme that was going around on Tiktok was a reference to some username she had on a defunct Youtube account, so the mere existence of this meme was part of the conspiracy in her mind (this despite her not even having a Tiktok account or interacting with any of the staggeringly large numbers of kids making that meme). Before she cut me off after deciding I was a ringleader of the conspiracy, I think she ended up concluding that the Minecraft kids were all shitcoin billionaires who were also involved in human trafficking somehow, IIRC, and said they also legally changed her birthday.
The level of absolute hatred for the "stalkers" you're describing was how she was, too. Like, this was a coming-up-on-thirty-years-old woman who genuinely believed some middle schoolers who talked shit to her on a Minecraft server had ruined her entire life and taken everything from her, and after a while they were all she could talk about, and she became very irritable when made to notice basically anything in the world if she wasn't able to quickly see how it could fit into her narrative.

What is interesting is that in 2008 when I was a middle schooler myself, I began to sleep super late in the night, averaging a bedtime of 5AM and waking up at 4PM and sometimes skipping school because I was mostly very depressed over things going in my life.
I would play counter strike a lot but not all the time and I had the impression that a girl that played regularly with me had me hacked and was stalking me. I stopped playing the game and it went away, I had her on MSN... But 2009 with Facebook and other things came along and I guess it all went away.

But the 4chan thing is something else entirely, I really hate them. They killed my creativity and interfered in my life majorly and only stopped because it got "stale". I hate them.

1. Keeping your virginity until at least age 30 will ensure that you have the time to mature and really understand the gravity of the commitment of entering a relationship.

2. You will be more confident in yourself and in your decisions, knowing that you are waiting for the right person and the right time, rather than entering into relationships impulsively.

3. You will be able to focus on developing other areas of your life, such as your career, hobbies, and passions, as you learn to be content in your own skin.

By your 30s, the women around you aren't looking for a relationship, they're looking for marriage.

The only "pro" of being a 30 year old virgin is that your genes have not been allowed to further corrupt the species.

Don't be a little bitch. Study harder or go to a temp agency. Good pussy follows hard work or luck. Wallowing is not admirable nor worthy of mourning.

The """"""pros""""""""" of being a 30 year old virgin lmaoooo. You're not a better partner and you're not improving your future relationship. You're a failed manchild and there will be no relationship.

Why not date someone from a different country who will throw their pussy at you? Isn't that better than killing yourself?

What a cope hahah. If you think more then one minute about it you will realize that those are thing you can do and learn in a relationship. How about you don't date someone that hinders you in those things? You should be able to grow in a relationship as a person. Maybe you shouldn't date some wirdo who will fuck up your live

Didn't read all that junk. But I will say this one thing about 30 yr old virgins: They Haven't ruined their chemical bonding system by having meaningless sex.

For normies, it's not a matter of hard work or luck. It just happens to them naturally.

If you have to put in any effort, you are a failure.

>How would you know what gets girls if you've never had one?
the scientific blackpill. its justified to believe in strong science, because science flows from philosophy

and philosophy is how we justify belief in anything, and philosophy justifies itself, in the way that logic verifies logic and math verifies math, etc

>Stop being a loser
you want to give me a qt korean gf?
lol
everyday i want to die
telling me to stop being a loser is like telling a homeless person to "just buy a house and get a good job, bro!"

doesnt work that you, you disingenuous retard. fucking how disgusting of a person can you be, to gaslight like that? fucking shameless disgusting pathetic excuse of a human being, you are

I was a 30 year old virgin that lost it at 32
The only benefit I can see is you didn't fall into marriage with some fat hag or end up paying child support after getting divorce rapped. 

Other than that it fucking sucks.
My youth was stolen from me. 
Younger women show interest in me all the time and I can't even reciprocate it because I'm so depressed over missing out on what everyone else got. 
Also they'd probably run for the hills once they find out I'm 10+ years older than them.

Your lack of experience with women is going to prevent you from ever finding a relationship at that age.

This can still happen to you even in your 30's or 40's. Not much of a win honestly.

i hate being. I cannot put it in more simple terms. I am fundamentally dissatisfied with who I am, what I do and what I can. the promise of oblivion seems to trump every ambition or motivation. the joy of one night fades quickly into anhedonic stagnation. the promise of love rushes in with a kick of adrenaline only to linger in my body as a dull pain. I am stuck in paradigms and ways of thinking that reduce the world to interactions between particles and movement of energy. the hypnosis of life quickly fades into reality. cold uncaring reality. lol!

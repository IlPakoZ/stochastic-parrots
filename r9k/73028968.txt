Share about music you've made, are making, or planning to make. Of course, you can also talk about other anons' music, if you'd like.

Another crack at the album idea. This one definitely has more of a nostalgic sound than the other one. I'm not gonna be able to check y'all's songs this time, sorry. At least not till much later today, since I have a bit of a trip to go on. Can't wait to listen to some of the stuff y'all make though.

Good to see you again, anon! Assuming you're who usually posts these on Thursday. The music style sounds similar as well. Speaking of the song, this shit goes super hard, man. I absolutely love the unsettling, dissonant mood. And the drum pattern. Do you have any music pages?
And good luck on your trip!
Alls I have to present to the class this Thursday is the same ol' album I made in 2021. Been trying to work on new music, but life's many stresses have taken a machete to my ankles.

I recently partnered up with someone on SoundCloud. He has a ton of demos to work with that I'm doing vocals for. We're planning on doing a 10 track demo. This is the first rough demo song so far. Not even sure if it will be something even on the actual demo, but it's our starting point:

>>73034269
First thing that popped in my head was Silverchair's Emotion Sickness but done in the style of early Tool. I like it.
--- 73034540
>>73034394
I appreciate it, Anon. I'll check that song out. The first thing I mentioned to my partner after I started writing the lyrics was that the song was giving me Tool/Perfect Circle vibes.

This is a partial sample of the next track we're working on. I've changed a lot of the chorus since I recorded this- but the verses are going to sound the same in the end. Quite a bit of Roman Empire/Latin elements are sort of naturally bleeding into the writing and I've decided to go with it.

What the hell man, that was the fastest 2 minutes and 32 seconds of my life. I really like how you delivered the line
>I won't be your Judas failing
Actually felt it. Is the dude you're working with doing all the instruments?
--- 73034777
>>73034678
Sweet. Thanks so much. That version I didn't get to recording the second pre-chorus, chorus, solo and outro- so it's going to be over 3 minutes long. And yeah, he's doing all the instrumentals so far. Though, I also play guitar and bass. The next track, I'll be recording some lead guitar for. Has a lot of Pink Floyd/Rush prog sound to it.

These are the completed lyrics:

[Vox Irae]

Got the worst of it today
Got the call from the back of my head with another hip-shot shameful display
Why can't it all be camp?
They like to sully the names of our heroes
If I supply the nails-
When you gonna come pound them into my palms?

If you hear the voice of rage 
Commit

They want you muzzled and isolated 
Spinning sick webs of spite, fear, and cancer
Evil consumes us as good men do nothing
Give me venom
I am vengeance 

What a wretched man that I am
Who will free me from this body of death?
I won't be your Judas failing and nailing him back up
What a wretched world
Full of wretched people
They love the lie: "We're all created equal"

Obfuscate my core beliefs
Time justifies my rage
Everyone- a mechanical emerald cut in the shape of God's love
You want to save the world?
Maybe that makes you evil
I want to help the Basilisk purge the cancer disguised as people

My country is in need of righteous reckoning 

They want you muzzled and isolated 
Spinning sick webs of spite, fear, and cancer
Evil consumes us as good men do nothing
Give me venom
I am vengeance 

What a wretched man that I am
Who will free me from this body of death?
I won't be your Judas failing and nailing him back up
What a wretched world
Full of wretched people
They love the lie: "We're all created equal"

Vox irae

Give us an audience 
Let me light them up
We are beckoning 
Get behind me

Loved Emotion Sickness. How did I miss these guys? I started listening and it was surreal to hear how similar my vocals sound like his. You're absolutely right. It's given me ideas for some things to incorporate/experiment with in my singing. Thank you.
--- 73035127
wrote this when i was about 19 or 20 and recorded it a couple years later, not me singing btw i'm on bass in this project

interesting, mostly pretty good lol but it's also tongue in cheek. idk i like it
>>73031850
really digging this alot
>>73031639
this is fantastic cool riffs and honestly cool recording and production too. love the kinda jpop breakdown dynamic shift thing
--- 73035310
Song I wrote from anon's post the other day. Just redid the vocals today for some practice.

--- 73035426
>>73035310
Holy shit. I liked this a LOT more than I expected to. The guitar panned right has an awesome tone. The bass kick sound/presence is perfect. Really dig the vocal effects. And the disjointed structure works just right in an unexplainable way.
I would listen to more stuff like this, for sure.
I could imagine some grunge style guitar distorted to the point of feedback breaking out of nowhere, along with some screaming vocals.

This is quality work.
--- 73035606
>>73034269
>>73034540
These demos are pretty sick! Wish I could sing this good, I only sound half decent when I hide behind studio magic lel

>>73035426
>>73035437
Thanks! How convincing is the screaming anyway? It's really just a cringe fake whisper scream I can do comfortably in my bedroom. I feel like I'm finally grasping a method to the madness and might be able to produce something legit soon.
--- 73035638
>>73035310
Yeah- the screams thrashed.
I just sent this to my partner to see what he thinks. This is like lightning in a bottle, man.
Do you have other stuff? Do you work with anyone else? Because it would be a crime if you're not.
--- 73035698
>>73035606
Nah, your screams sound stellar.
I used to do more screams like this, and you made me want to go back to doing them again.
I did a couple of more metal songs- the first being a cover, and the second being an original:

I would love to work with someone else that does screaming vocals.
--- 73035806
>>73035638
I have a bunch of random stuff laying around, I practice songwriting by lurking /r9k/ and turning doomposts and schizoposts into short songs. I was compiling it on youtube for a while but haven't uploaded in a long time. Here's one of my favorites. I thought about rerecording it but the bad production quality kinda adds to the charm on this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLCW1OeOEc0 [Embed]

>>73035698
Good stuff, looks like you got the whole vocal range covered. I feel like the vocals need to be pushed back just a little to settle into the mix but that's just semantic bullshit, as far as technique goes it all sounds spot on.
--- 73035960
>>73035127
I really like this. This is something I'd listened to while skating. It has one of those bygone summer days feel to it. Is this project still going or have you started a new one?
>>73035310
>>73035806
Fucking kino man. Wish my screams sounded this good.

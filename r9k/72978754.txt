after you've become old enough to identify your own issues, then solving them is your responsibility. if you've been an adult for 5 years and haven't picked up some of your own crap and tried to untangle it and sort yourself out, then you're also at fault for your issues.

I know all my issues. They are Christians who have this phobia of me being a normal fag so they homeschooled me. Went from being asked out by a girl to having severe social anxiety. But hey at least I'm not a degenerate athiest... oh wait.

when normies talk about how you can just move past it it shows a severe lack of perspective on JUST HOW MUCH parents can fuck you over developmentally

JFL when his GF sees this video she will realize he is broke and a crybaby. Her hypergamy will kick in and she'll begin looking for a richer man

Dude is 31 years old. His GF is 23. He is basically a sugar daddy while having a negative net worth of -20k

I watched a Dave Ramsey clip yesterday. He was losing his mind at a guy who just graduated medical school and, along with his new doctor wife, was 670k in debt.
>omg how could you
>what's wrong with you
Guy explains he has no family support, so had to pay for college himself
>what the hell did you spend the money on, that's insane, that's a small house, blah blah blah
I googled the average tuition costs for the degrees the guy had...and it was 300k. So he and his wife had about 70k extra to pay for food and board etc since you can't work and do medicine at the same time for the last couple of years. His debt was completely reasonable. Not only that, after his residency he and his wife would make 400k a year combined...Ramsey was like "what are you gonna do, live on 50k a year for three years!?"
>...uh, sure
It was complete clickbait.

The image is obviously not meant to be taken seriously, but my advice remains the same. You must treat life like an RPG. What do you do if your character sucks? You improve his stats. Simple as.
>Improve your looks.
>Improve your verbal dexterity so you can influence people and defend your opinions/beliefs in front of a crowd (winning an argument isn't about logic, it's about how you verbalise your points).
>Improve your understanding of social dynamics so you can avoid misadventures with women and with people in general.
When you look good and know how to speak, the world starts to become a more welcoming place. All of a sudden it's easier for you to get a job. All of a sudden you find yourself in a long term relationship with a cutie 3.14. All of a sudden you get invited to take part in a lucrative venture out of the blue. All of sudden people start vouching for you and you influence grows.
This is how one makes it, annon.

everyone does so in their own way. you for example go on 4chan and ask other people how they deal with it. some others might smoke weed, or find a religous cultmunity to join. some just kill themselves, but most people just be ignorant of it, worry about making money and finding enjoyable ways of spending the money.
I worked in misery, spent my money traveling. moved to some place with sun and tried making friends, life got better that way.

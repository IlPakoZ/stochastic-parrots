Jesus, Jesus I give my life to you. You are my Lord and my Savior. Guide me to your Father. I know that even if everyone in the world hates me, you alone will still love me. I turn to you, always, there is no friend like you, Jesus Christ. Amen.

There is none.
Morals are manmade creations designed to control populations and keep society stable.
This is why hypocrisy is so rampand in all times, people don't actually give a fuck about morals.

It makes me happy religion is dying. Less and less retards born beliving in magic tricks every single year; more apathy and rage towards existing religious institutons. When your kind is dead you will not go to heaven and hell; you will be dust and ash, and in many years I hope we will have forgotten your """"""""god""""""" entirely desu

Another day passes as a repressing tranny.
Just when I thought I kicked it for sure this time I made the mistake of opening social media.
Seeing an image of a group of women having fun together made me feel like shit again. 
Thanks God for giving me autism and the wrong chromosome.

Being a woman seems a lot more fun
Just being happy and chill

No. It's not possible for me to be happy.
Everything was ripped away from me before I was born.

But if you were a woman, you would be happy?

Much more. I won't be barred from feminine activities. I won't have to fake confidence and masculinity everywhere I go. 
I keep everything in my head. I'm too scared of what society thinks. 
Unfortunately I cannot live in that timeline.

I hate my life. 
The only way out is suicide.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu? I used to do karate when I was a kid, want to go back to it someday.

Yeah. 
Modern shotokan point karate is pretty shit nowadays because of the Olympics. Full contact karate like Kyokushin is cool as fuck though, but its pretty hard to find dojos.

Do muay Thai at some point. Remember to lift weights, train takedowns and look up kneesovertoesguy if you ever get chronic pain.

Think I could graffiti something like this?

>>73124874 (OP)
I actually did start tagging but then realized i was shit at it

Why not, if you like it. You wouldn't be getting that up though. Takes too long to do outside of chill spots.

Everyone starts out somewhere, that's why you have to practice. The most important thing is that you were actually getting up, it's a skill of it's own, other than the actual technique of the tag

I've seen people get permission from the property owners to make art on their exterior walls in business areas. I wanna try that someday

If you want to go that way cool, that is not graff though and I have nothing to say about it.

Also if I get caught that's a 3500 fine and possibly even forced wageslavery, that was a cold shower for me

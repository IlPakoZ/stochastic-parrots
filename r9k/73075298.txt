Investing in women right now is like buying bitcoin at 67k. Just bide your time with massage parlors, don't freak out and panic (unless you're over 30), this bubble will pop.

Yes, but try not to smell like alcohol. Also benzos work better. You might get limp dick but still.

How the fuck will the bubble pop?
Fuck apps and social media ruined everything and created this male inceldom boom. They will not disappear overnight.
I do agree that incel men should escortcel where possible. I did it for a while, though it is underwhelming compared to a real FWB/GF.

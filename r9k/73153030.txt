Bigger is always better.
Unless it's Korean and Japanese guys, they're exempt :3

Women never want to admit that anything bigger than 8 inches or even 7.5 inches (for some women) is too big
They don't want men to feel reassured so they like the "only big dicks satisfy women" meme
If they said 6.5 inches was too big a lot of 5.5-6 inch guys would feel great, as would 4-5 inch guys as it trickles down

But they know if they actually said the truth men wouldn't be as insecure and put them high on the pedestal they're already on

Ideal is 3-5 inches, no joke. I tried using a standard size dildo once, it was horrible, way too big. and hurt my cervix which gave me the most disgusting pelvic sensation I ever felt. Maybe I just have a really small vagina or something, but I never want anything bigger than 5 inches near me ever again.

i like smaller dicks. even micro dicks are cute as fuck, actually i could fall in live with a dickless guy because trust me, it's me doing the pegging and dominating not my bf

Anything bigger than 6.5 is a hard pass. Accidentally hitting your cervix is the worst, most nails on the chalkboard sensation I ever felt. Im convinced most size queens only are for the social status of their partner having a giant cock. 
I accidentally got an 8 inch dildo (I didnt check the size) and I use max half of it. Seriously. The only reason why women hate smaller dicks is because men keep saying themselves that big dick is superior and those woman are always trying to statusmaxx

A dick so long that it cant bend into a womans throat
A dick so thick that vaginal sex is painful because it compresses the walls when it moves through it like how babies do
Cock of those dimensions are extremely rare

the vagina is only like 2 inches deep and anything past that is stretching it. that is why sex usually hurts for women. i have only had sex with one guy who had a smaller than average penis that he was insecure about (3.5) and i was crying from the pain the whole time. porn girls probably use numbing cream or something to be able to have sex with very large penises. whether a girl prefers large medium or small penises depends on how masochistic she is. men enjoy watching porn involving men with large penises because they like seeing women get hurt. do what you will with this information.

No, most of the time the consequence of a penis being too big is the pain from slamming into the cervix, not the girth, usually. I have to adjust positions even w my 6.5 bf to have comfortable sex.
--- 73153297
>>73153276
I was lurking Reddit and found most of the women who like big dicks are unironic masochists who actually enjoy the pain and getting hurt. They are not normal or mentally healthy.

Girth is quite nice but I dislike length. I guess ideally my bfs penis should be 4 inches long and maybe idk, like 3-4 inches girth? Girthy but short is what I would like, but it seems to be quite a rare combo.
--- 73153323
>>73153282
Hitting the cervix is length not girth.

i cannot contribute to the main question of this thread but any other fembots who just dont enjoy penetrative stuff at all? not cuz its painful or anything i just dont like it, ive tried it quite a few times and never felt any pleasure from it, i masturbate exclusively with a vibrator now.
--- 73153362
>>73153174
The big dick meme is 100% some weird homosexual competition moids have with themselves. 

I think some women use penis size as a form of psychological leverage over men, because most guys tie their dick to their identity, and its very easy to hurt them that way, which is based lol. But in the end its all just a meme. Girth is more important than length. I want to feel pleasure from the sides of my walls. Not the empty space at the top which doesnt feel like anything before it gets to my cervix.

I recently had my first penetrative orgasm. Remember the gspot is just the back if the clit. Your clit is a pretty big gland that spans around ur vulva and inside (gspot). The best method Ive found is using a vibrator on the external clit until youre really close, and then inserting the vibrator and playing around w depth. When the clit is aroused, is swells, so in my case my gspot wasnt distinguishable until I got very aroused.
--- 73153373
Not really ideally I would love a bf with a 8 or 9 inch. Fully aroused there is no pain. My ex was 8 inches and it only hurt a little if I wasn't warmed up. It feels so good when he's big enough to hit it deep in just the right spot and I feel that electricity go up through my stomach with each thrust it's hard to explain

thanks fembots this thread really knocked some sense into my head
you are great

Good thread. People need to know that most women don't care for those porn dicks we are used to seeing. Those people are doing porn for a reason. I've never met a woman irl that wants those huge porn dicks. Im glad my dick isn't so big that i have to worry about hurting the other person and can just go hard. I'd imagine even men with 3-4 inch dicks can do a lot. I've noticed women don't care what goes into their pussy when they are in the right mood. Like even ONE finger at that point and they are going crazy. I hated my dick for years when i was a virgin. After losing virginity i noticed that it was all in my head. I fell for the propaganda.

I genuinely cannot imagine having a full 8 inches up there, last time I met an 8 inch guy I unzipped his pants and said no fucking way and broke up with him and didnt have sex.

Yeah I dont particularly enjoy penetration either honestly. Last time I read something like 75% of women dont even cum from PIV which is sad. 

I even read a radfem theory that moids condition us to enjoy PIV through clit stimulation, because PIV really isnt very enjoyable and often hurts us, and is basically a softer form of rape (not in the literal sense, but in making us do something for their pleasure more than our own) 

And also the self objectification factor (like how some women claim to receive physical pleasure and orgasms through giving blowjobs, even though this is physically impossible and purely a weird psychological thing) 

I wouldnt even care if my vagina disappeared one day and nothing entered it again, I would rather just have my clit and labia licked and sucked for hours.

It depends on your anatomy. I thought I was incapable of penetrative orgasms until recently. (Ive been masturbsting since 10) 
The gspot is just the back of the clit, how prominent it is depends on the woman. Although I still think 3-4 inches is ideal.

>>73153366
>Your clit is a pretty big gland that spans around ur vulva and inside (gspot)
People say this and it might be a biological fact, but no amount of penetration feels anywhere near as good as basic clit stim to me, no matter which way I try it. I could do without PIV forever if necessary. If some other women enjoy it and can orgasm from penetration then I feel happy for them. But I cant personally come from it whatsoever.
--- 73153458
4-5 is perfect not just cope anything 6 or above heads into uncomfortable and painful territory. My first bf was 7 inches, my current is 5.1, I have a much better sex life with my current bf. Rarely had penetrative sex with my ex and if we did I could not handle it all the way.

I think I found my g spot and I have tried rubbing it and stimulating it many times before. It was like the little rough part (almost like a cats tongue feeling I guess?) inside and I did actually manage to squirt from pressing it (it was probably just piss) but I did not feel that good from it and it definitely didnt make me orgasm, or even close.

--- 73153486
>>73153467
Yeah, then clit stim is probably the way to go for you. For me I couldnt even find it and if you squirted thats a good indicator that you were stimulating your gspot/skenes gland

My hymen broke during gymnastics when I was 9 from doing over splits. So..Yeah.

That's funny I did the same thing once but it was with a guy that had a really tiny dick it was like 3 inches hard. I had a fight or flight moment and was just like, no

I want a bf with a 3 inch dick. For some reason, women with big clits and men with small dicks are so hot to me. I want to suck on them.

The only true and honest common answer. Everyone else is virtue signaling or a dicklet larping about how he absolutely slays with his 1 incher.

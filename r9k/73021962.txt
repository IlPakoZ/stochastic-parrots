Yes it happens more often than you think, but likely not on r9k, due to it being a generally terrible environment for meeting people.

Yea. But when they do it they are "smart" about it to the extent that they will use every resource in their network to find out about every single thing about you without you ever knowing. 

Or so they think.

Men and women can avoid it simply asking how many people they chat with in an average day. If it's over 3 I never waste my time.

I actually kind of watch those videos but they'll be like; fucking jenny from down the street aint going to listen to me but I'm about to tell y'all about how I do this. It makes sense and it's rational. 9/10 times I wouldn't bothered to listen to it but fuck she really threw some shade on jenny and she had it coming.

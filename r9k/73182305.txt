Particularly interested in replies from 25+ fembots but I guess any fembot can reply if they want to.

Fuck off to /soc/, you will never be a robot and neither will any female.

No. If he is a virgin at that age, then he obviously has so many redflags. I'm going into a relationship for companionship, not to fix a guy.

I would not, but not because you are a virgin, more because I am a shotacon who prefers teenage boys. Being a virgin isnt a big deal anon, as long as you arent trying to date some judgmental normie stacy slut then no woman really cares.

Retards, read the first reply and then follow it.
None of you will ever be robots, nor will you ever interact with real robots.
All you get is the same tourists you're akin to.

What if he's hot and rich and the virginity is due to personal beliefs rather than social ineptitude?

You think so? Is there any way to specifically identify the kinds of women who care about virginity and avoid them?

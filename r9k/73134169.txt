I thought cutters were just attention seekers and many probably are but when you develop a habit your brain makes it so hard to fucking stop. My arm is scarred to shit from biting it for years since I started doing it to cope with anger. Theres a huge red spot that formed recently and is growing that looks like a pimple but its not and its hurting like crazy. Fucking hate myself fucking hate vidya fuck man sometimes i want someone to just bash my head in with a baseball bat.

have you considered uh changing what games you play?
if you play games like DOTA, or some battle Royale, high stakes competition you'll get angry
if you play telltale adventure games you're not going to get angry at the video game probably. You could just pull up a walkthrough if you're stuck

Sorry i took so long to respond i assumed the thread was gonna die with no replies since its just some blogpost schizo rant. Anyway, Rocket League was what I was playing I pretty much quit every pvp type game except that beause of my anger and self harm. Its the only one I can still somewaht handle playing but I guess Im just not having a grrat day or something cause I waa getting too pissed. Ive mostly stuck to single player games for the past few years but theres just not too many im interested in so I just casually play Rocket League but my mental state really just cant handle it sometimes.

if you want to control your output of emotions you need to control your input.

just consider your information diet like your food diet
If you keep taking in things that are bad for you, you will feel bloated and bad 
Try walking through the forest listening to classical music instead of watching degrading porn, you know what I mean?

Yeah I get what you mean when you say it like that. Exercise and diet really do effect a lot of things. Its somrthing we always ignore but know to be true I guess. Fuck man. Ive just been waiting for ui to get a bit warmer out its still pretty cold where I live but I like going out at night.

Im not sure. Ive never thought about it that deeply. I dont cut but instead bite myself to cope with anger and sometimes stress. I cant even remember when I started this its been years probably almost 10 by now if I had to guess. Its left a permanent and very noticable scar that will never go away completely even if I somehow stopped right now and tried to heal it. I just wish I could erase anger from my being entirley and literally just become a robot cause im tired of hurtung myself. My arms been throbbing un slight pain all day because of this. I just dont know what to do ive wired my brain for years to do this and its by far my worst habit and something I genuinely want to change.

I think you're developing a habit for attention like everyone else with this bullshit problem.

What makes you say that? I hate it. People ask me about it sometimes and its embarassing so I end up always wearing hoodies or long sleave shirts if I evwr even end up going out in public in the firsr place. I serioulsly just get filled with nuclear level rage sometimes and have since childhood when I would break a lot of shit. I started doing this to myself a long time ago instead to cope with my emotions and havent been able to stop. Its just been something i ignored for a long time but my arms been in pain all day and really makes me realize the damage im doing. This shit is worse than fucking cutting.

Not general attention from everyone, you want to be seen as someone who went through pain because your life is so fucking pathetic no humble person brags about their pain so of course you will be embarrassed generally. If you were actually embarrassed you wouldnt be posting about it and you would stop. There is no chemical addiction to pain just do drugs to cope like a normal person and stop whining.

This does not explain why ive developed an addiction for biting myself. Who am i trying show this shit too and for what? Theres no reason for this i just have a mental probelm and dont know how to deal with it so I developed a harmful coping mechanism that is hard to break.

>If you were actually embarrassed you wouldnt be posting about it and you would stop.
This place is anoymous I dont really talk with anyone about this irl. If anything I just wanted to rant because I was so pissed and wanted to take my mind off it in a different way besides hurting myself. Maybe i could get advice from others who have the same problem and how they dealt with it.

>There is no chemical addiction to pain just do drugs to cope like a normal person and stop whining.
This is just plain ignorant to say. Do you really believe this retarted statement? Im always on substances too and sure it helps but if I dont have alcohol or weed the withdrawl makes it twice as worse.

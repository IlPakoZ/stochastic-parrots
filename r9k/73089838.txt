one way you can start, not say this is the definitive way but you can start going to mass on sundays. Church is always open to new members, and mass is a place where your local community is. How to go to mass, just find the local roman catholic church or whatever other denomination you want but I don't know those very well, look up the mass schedule on google maps usually 10:30 or 10am or so on, and just go. It's only an hour long, if you feel shy just sit in the back aisle and enjoy it. You don't have to do anything really, just sit and listen, there's songs, readings, give peace to each other (handshake) and at the end is the eucharist where they give everyone this wafer/cookie and some wine but you don't have to do any of this, can just stay and sit. maybe carry a dollar with you for collection. at the end there's church announcements about activities, sometimes there's a little meetup after mass where everyone goes to lounge and have coffee with baked goods and do small talk or volunteering and so on. 

remember no need to go to church if you feel strongly about muh christcucks but remember, it exists and has been the main source of social outlet for the past thousand years for the western world.

i dont know your specifics but im 26 and I was a loner from literally 11-22. 

I was able to change it by going to the local 24hr Fitness. I know the cliches of "working out" usually are bullshit but I was able to meet some dudes who worked out there and after working out together and only seeing them at the gym they invited me to play basketball. Fortunately I had a hoop growing up (dad was an ex college basketball player) so I knew how to play but I suddenly found myself with a group of dudes I played basketball with.

I am still friends with them and with the experience of talking with them I have made buddies with a few coworkers.

You gotta put yourself out there where you might get rejected or hurt but you wont change until you do

getting a job with career opportunities that you find interesting is a start.
it sounds like such a boomer normie advice, one that i would disregard completely 2 years ago but the hard part is finding something you give two fucks about and can have something of an interest in.
i work as an ordinary seaman for a company that does diving jobs on fish farms. there are opportunities for me to become a diver myself so thats pretty rad. had to take some courses out of my own pocket tho which was a little expensive but doing that myself instead of trying to find a company to do it for me put me miles ahead of other applicants.

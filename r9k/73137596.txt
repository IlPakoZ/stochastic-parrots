I know sarcasm is hard to detect over the internet but this post you screenshotted is ironic.

If you're asking about the first part, then yes, lots of young people are living paycheck to paycheck. The good paying jobs stopped hiring people from outside and doing nepotism hires, leaving plenty of college educated people trying to start their careers to take whatever jobs they can to survive. This means an entire nation of people living on less than $15-20 an hour (some places the minimum wage isn't even $8 yet), with massive inflation making food and gas prices rise, and rent increases all the time for literally no reason. And yet no one starts any riots over this because they're too scared of losing what little luxuries they have in life.

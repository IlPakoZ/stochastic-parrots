I think being a hikikomori in the early 2000's consuming limited japanese / asiatic media was way easier than this. 

Why is it so suffocating being a NEET nowadays? The social pressure and the neuroticism on the psyche feels completely insane.

The internet changed too much, what the hell is happening?

aside from prices increasing everyday and NEETbux not covering for everything it's also that the stuff we're into is no longer for us.
weeb shit is now flooded with normies, so discussing hobbies is no longer fun.
games are getting less and less fun.
maybe it's just my depression talking and i'm being negative about my own hobbies but i don't enjoy being a NEET anymore.

Neet, Hikikomori, the "Chemical Generation"(early drug addicts), etc ... will become a legacy of the end of the 20th century and early 2000's.

They are all becoming dysfunctional and old in this day and age, growing up inside a society that has never really accepted them. Although there were psychiatrists and writers trying to understand the phenomenon, they are basically forgotten at this point. 

It's not depression, is a reality.

This is a big part of it. Most people won't acknowledge this because most older people didn't use the internet during the Web 1.0 era, and terminally online zoomers only came around when Web 2.0 had already replaced it.

Web 1.0 was a marvel and felt way better. Content was spread out by topic, not by media. If you wanted some Final Fantasy 7 fanart, you went on a Final Fantasy forum, not some bland subreddit run by the same people as all other subreddits and looking and functioning like all other subreddits. Also, votes and likes and reblogs and retweets and all that shit wasn't a thing yet, nor were nestled threads, so you could actually hold linear conversations with people that could change direction over time, instead of the insane nonsense now where every conversation is a slave to the updoots and the downdoots. I used to make friends within the first 3 days anytime I registered on a forum back in the day. I have used 4chan for decades and used to be on Reddit and other shitholes like it for a couple of years and didn't make a single one. All of this made it easier to at least have some semblance of a social life as a NEET. Today, all you get is Big Tech social media mindfuck.

i think mote than the doots, its that persistence was lost. obviously, 4chan never had persistence, but that was the point. 

but with forums, you would have long conversation chains lasting forever, and which you could browse back through years' worth of stuff if you found a forum you liked. plus, active mods would usually penalize people if they kept saying the same shit over and over. 

but with reddit, even though you could technically look back at older posts, there's no point, because the same conversation gets repeated over and over again whenever the same subject is brought up. rather than the conversation evolving over time, the conversation narrows down to the few opinions that get the right kind of doot.

Companies and normies destroyed everything. The people that rejected you and led you to this lifestyle are now the majority of the internet user base but they are living normal lives while you are stuck in a room. It's natural to feel disconnected.

they arent. average normies are becoming more isolated and asocial by the day. there will come a point where only autists will go outside to meet up for their weird interests, and normies will be always inside scrolling phone. already we arent far off from that.

Being NEET is the same as it has always been. Inside your room/space you create your own reality. If it is not satisfying, then you have failed. Probably due to a misapprehension of reality or what it means to be human, an insight into human nature. Being NEET is not for the weak, it requires discipline.

The simplest way I can put it is that paradise is unendurable. This is a simple truth. To be NEET you must create artificial difficulty for yourself. You must create things, push yourself to do something better, to produce something. If you only consume, you are doomed to fail.

The great irony of modern times is that it's now harder to be a NEET, but also more unbearable to be a wagie than ever before. Basically, everything is just shit now.

Can't fucking agree more with this. It's finantially impossible to become a NEET and wageslaving will transform you into a husk.

Because normies are on the Internet now. I went on the Internet to avoid normies. Now I have proverbially touch grass to get away from them.

Japanese media has catered more and more to hikkis with indulgent wish-fulfillment in the last decade. Also, what kind of NEET cares about social pressure? Kids in school are drugged up and offing themselves over pressure I've literally never felt, all of this neuroticism exists far outside my bubble.

I ran out of media to watch. I have been unemployed for 3 years. I'm 26 currently. I've taken up web animation because it helps me to feel good while permanently unemployed/trading stocks for money:

There is a saying "find the others". If you want to find people you can, they're still there. Nothing has disappeared exactly. Especially helps to go places which naturally attract us. In general as long as there is a single patch of ground left untouched you can go there. 
>>73016062
I don't accept life. Other way around. This shit is not worthwhile.
--- 73018376

I think the best would be to work 2 days part-time while on buxx. The rest is up to strength of character. You can literally pursue anything you want.

I have no interest in doing so.
I've had 5 years of working in construction with my Dad, and I did not enjoy any of it.

Everyone else is worse than my Dad to be with for me.

It regulates your emotions better to have that contrast, youll be more productive and feel happier going back to endless internet consumption, and its especially good if IRL you can have some human interaction. Doesn't need to be construction. Can just do weekend jobs somewhere.

i live on neetbux, around 900 a month. i was lucky enough to find a place that's only 650 a month. but from there it's difficult. you need to take advantage of things like food and utility assistance.

>In general as long as there is a single patch of ground left untouched you can go there.

i guess i just don't know where that is anymore. i find it hard to relate to a lot of people these days.
--- 73018432
>>73018412
Most human interaction I have in real life ends in rejection. It's never anything I say or do, but people simply do not like me in real life, and they totally shut me out of their homes and life when they speak to me enough especially if they have siblings.

I do not feel happier talking to people. I am pretty sure this place is just another mars because I am 26 years old and have no friends in life even though 50% of my blood is British.

Become vegan, go to a local vegan community and boom - easy friends. If you are a het man it's also easy to find a partner. You don't even have to do much beside just simply being vegan. As a bonus, it's much healthier and is damn cheap.

I am sorry, but vegetarians are not good people. They are evil people that can not handle how evil they really are, so they totally quit eating meat to say they are good because their brains are extremely violent, which is a lie, when in all reality they are very bad.

No. Being a NEET / Hikikomori radically changed. Even japanese media is not exactly created for us of some older generation (depressed, outcasts, fascists, etc.. - although you could say that those elements are still growing in other portions of society)

Hell, you had Hikikomori mangakas like Watsuki and Miura essentially being Lolicons and, with no doubt, enjoying the "real" lolis. They were secluded for a very LONG time.
I have no doubt that people like Oda were also indulging into this kind of lifestyle too.

I almost exclusively consume media made before 2016. Mostly pre-2010s stuff. I take comfort there exists several decades worth of decent vidya and over a century of television, film and radio to enjoy before shit got fucked up. I never have to watch anything new. There's so much content that I could spend my whole life without even having to touch modern cancer.
The cut-off used to be 2012, but when the 2016 election made America shift in to a mode of total political obsession and constant culture warring made me realize that maybe things in 2012 weren't as bad as I thought.
The only new things I enjoy are the occasional Jap game maybe once or twice a year. Maybe watch Guy Fieri with my family and MMA with the boys. I absolutely cannot stand modern television to the point where if I turn on a TV show and it's new enough to be natively filmed in HD, my brain automatically prepares to find something else to watch.
--- 73020626
What are the other life options? 
The word "career" gets thrown a lot around 4chan, but how many people have a career anyways? Most people endure dead end jobs in western society. I don't know if anyone here has what it takes to be a salarymen in asia 
either
--- 73020682
>>73016084
Wasn't it because the web 1.0 was the territory of American middle-high class young men with college education that did not have to play the social game there? 
Probably the biggest issues were making everything gamified and conected to the real world

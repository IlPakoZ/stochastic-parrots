right... definitely haven't been that girl before...
--- 73001412
Yeah my bf is a really nice guy he's never even called me a bad name or anything
--- 73001422
It's funny how all girl loser always seems to have exes and guy losers are often virgins with no dating history. And people wonder why 'incels' are so bitter.
--- 73001434
>>73001382 (OP)
I'm gay and very guilty of this.
--- 73001483
>>73001382 (OP)
I'm not sure. I have no exes though. My bf is mentally ill like I am, and we're both a bit codependent, but we also get along extremely well. It might sound toxic, but I like the fact that if one of us gets really into something, the other one will put genuine effort into trying to get into it as well.

how do women always claim to have 'shit taste' seems like they are just blind. the amount of women I know who date digital pimps, deviants, bums, roiders, druggies and fuckups and get their heart broken is staggering. its like being a mess of a human is attractive. then they always turn around and say 'I have shit taste, how does this happen?' 
like, bitch, the dude is drunk 3 out of the 7 days of the weak and covered in tattoos. how could you not tell.

Well, character flaws are generally what makes a human being a human being. So that's not entirely surprising.

You sound like you're compensating for something, anon.
--- 73002333
>>73001382 (OP)
I have thay natural reaction of jealousy at first, whenever I read these stories. 
But then, I think that, if they still pick those people over me, then if must mean that I'm somehow worse than some abusive retard. 
Makes me wonder what's so wrong with me, sometimes...
--- 73002364
>>73002333
It might seem harsh, but a nice "good kid" guy doesn't awaken any feelings in women. don't be abusive, but have some edge. Understand this.

>add femanon

--- 73002412
>>73002364
Nah, I get what you mean. 
I've developed some of it, I think. 

But still, holy shit, it's just baffling that I am somehow worse than these stories. Sometimes I can't wrap my head around it. 
Few things make me seethe, this used to be one, now I just find it odd. And non-virgin neets.

because they dont make their pussy wet
all normgroids are pussy-chasers therefore women dictate male behaviour 
if women found reading books attractive men wouldnt swarm gyms to abusechadmax and would go to libraries instead

youre so fucking originally retarded

She doesn't sound very sweet if she only goes for whatever makes her pussy wet.
--- 73002486
>>73002451
all girls are only sweet on the surface but will only still date chads who give her tingles, which happens to be abusechads.
--- 73002502
spoiler alert: all women have shitty taste in men if you define taste as sexual attraction
--- 73002616

If women have shit taste in men then why do I not have a girlfriend... curious.....

There's a difference between a character flaw and a red flag, anon.

Being in a plane crash is exciting, but I doubt anyone would take that over, say, riding a roller-coaster.
--- 73002739
>>73002446
Nah he's smart. It would have been only a matter of time before she turned on him too.
--- 73002745
>>73002616
You have xchan. She probably likes you.
--- 73003080
>>73002745
come on I said this a billion times now, we're just friends. Can we move on from her pls lets forget she ever existed
--- 73003178

>There's a difference between a character flaw and a red flag, anon.
... Red flags ARE character flaws. Like, really bad one.

>Being in a plane crash is exciting, but I doubt anyone would take that over, say, riding a roller-coaster.
This analogy doesn't connect to anything you were talking about.
--- 73003302
>>73003080
C'mon. Didn't she end her egir phase just to please you? She probably likes you.
--- 73003325

I had some pretty valid arguments too, I'm a very convincing man
--- 73003489
>>73001382 (OP)
i've had two bfs
1st i met online and we were together 10ish years but sadly it fizzled
2nd was for under a few months before i found out he was cheating on me with underage girls.


i just want a bf who's autistic, mentally ill, and shut in like me, not the fake kind that still has a huge esocial life either. i just want to ramble to each other about stuff neither of us really understands but still enjoy seeing each other happy or being in the same room. my friends tell me i have bad taste in guys but i don't really want to even try to be in a relationship with someone who i obviously won't get along with or have to wear a mask around.
--- 73003504
>>73003325
You could probably convince her to be your gf too.
--- 73003511
>>73001405

--- 73003520
>>73003489
This is what I want in a gf but desu girls like you are a prime target for abusive guys so it's hard, lots of horror stories about quiet shut in girls who ended up falling for some dickhead because her autism made her too thick to realize what was going on.

How do you look irl, Kumagawa-kun? You are probably not bad looking.
--- 73003546

that's something even the world's greatest debaters wouldnt be able to do
--- 73003552
>>73001382 (OP)
I've been in love with a guy who has severe schizophrenia for around 5 years now. I don't think he is a shitty person though, he is great overall, kind, sweet, good-natured. But having a relationship or kids is kinda impossible considering his illness. Last time we saw each other he was convinced my mom was a devil sent from hell to kill us both, he locked me up, and after his episode was over he didn't remember any of it.
--- 73003562
>>73003543
>You are probably not bad looking.
what makes you think that anon?
--- 73003593
>>73003546
I'm sure they would.
The world's greatest debaters probably all have wives.
>>73003562
Idk. What do you look like?
The egirls all seem to like you.
--- 73003626

Do it because you fucking want to. Stop being deliberate tools for hoes who are fickle and change who they like at the drop of hat.
--- 73003638
>>73003520
autism usually comes with bluntness or some rudeness, so i can deal with a guy whos a little spergy here and there. as long it's never physical or we can talk stuff out it'd be nice.
my second relationship was exactly that, i didn't realize everything he was saying was a lie until he slipped up and i got suspicious and a friend helped me find out what he was doing. i was lucky but also stupid.
i think it's especially difficult to find someone we're looking for because anyone who's actually what we like is too busying isolating. it's hard to cross paths.
--- 73003678
>>73003626
I never implied that. In fact, I suggested going to the library regardless of women's opinions about it.
--- 73003702
>>73003638
I'm actually assburgers and definitely struggle to communicate, especially in verbal conversations. I like being alone a lot, unless I meet another weird who can ramble on about shared interests for hours. I live alone and sometimes go through the entire day not uttering a single word.
It's good that you were able to eventually spot it before it got too bad. Hope you weren't too emotionally attached, people underestimate the hurt from a breakup that someone who's very isolated and inexperienced can go through.
--- 73003770

What do you mean "all" I just befriended one, I like to think I'm charming but you're overestimating me a little

--- 73003922
>>73003702
i'm a neet with agoraphobia so aside from my big bro i don't really have anyone else to talk with either. i know it could be worse, but it gets lonely.
i was pretty attached, i think i could make a lot of excuses for someone if i loved them but cheating and underage stuff is irredeemable.
you sound really nice, anon. i hope you find that special girl you deserve.
--- 73003979
>>73003922
>agoraphobia
What's that like? Do you get anxiety attacks about going outside? My autism sometimes makes me feel really stressed out when I'm outside for too long, an unstoppable urge to come home back where everything is familiar, quiet and predictable.
--- 73004068
>>73003979
very similar, if i had to describe it- it's like i know i'm going to feel all that overwhelming fear and stress so i can't get the courage to leave my home. i'm lucky enough that i don't need to that often. there's also some weird paranoia component. lot's of "what if"s go through my brain. i was going to therapy for it and got a little better but when covid hit my therapist didn't want to see me in person anymore.
do you live in the city?
--- 73004147
>>73004068
I see, I don't necessarily have a problem with going outside, it just hits me randomly, usually when something has made me uncomfortable and I realize that I'm far away from home. What you describe reminds me of how people with OCD get stuck on those "what ifs", interesting to see how similar issues with anxiety can come from different disorders. Hearing that therapy was producing results sounds encouraging, you could stop being a NEET some day.
Yes, I live in a huge city, quiet neighborhood though.
--- 73004244
>>73001382 (OP)
a tail as old as time
--- 73004259
>>73004147
yeah, it's really only the minor differences that get you diagnosed with something else. from what my therapist says a lot of diagnoses are just throwing a dart at board in a general area and praying you're right.
i live in a major city too! right downtown sadly. maybe if i move to a smaller neighborhood things would be comfier.

no im average height

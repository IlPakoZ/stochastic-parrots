Why do normalfags think they can give good advice to incels when they've never had to seriously try to get a gf themselves? 99% of their advice amounts to completely unactionable platitudes.

Yeah no shit, normies are mindless cattle. Next

They want to feel like they tried to help to justify the bullying to themselves

This, normies don't really give a fuck about actually helping most of the time, they just want to be able to say they tried. Most people, especially insecure people, love having someone who isn't them definitely on the bottom of the totem poll as a punching bag for everyone's vented frustrations.

Sorry I was only trying to help.
If you're struggling with finding a girlfriend, have you perhaps tried being yourself? Worked for me

False, I spent the other day with a girl, didn't dare to make the first move n she then texted me to come fuck tomorrow. I can confirm all I've done my life was actually get worse. Don't ask me how I did it, I'm not sure either, I just know this is bs.

The way to cope is that these are none of your problems and you are not paid to solve them.
I've worked in politics, specifically as a starry eyed optimist looking to make a difference only to have that spark and ambition trampled on, leave these issues to the corrupt politicians and the general public, and if society is fine with how things are going(they are), then maybe they deserve to rot and burn.

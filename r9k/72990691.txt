Am I based or cringe?

I am interested in these novels as well to gain insights into female psychology, though I am under no delusions that the characters are all gigachads, which I am not. Though I am over 6ft.

they're just smut. a kind of pornography. and yes, the men in romance novels average 6' 3" and are handsome according to the studies done on these books. top 10% IRL looks easily for the MEDIAN male interest in the book.

From what I've read they like evil but deep down good characters. Like they are extremely dominating and seemingly cruel, but on the inside they are actually good.

they like fried ice. there is no such thing as "evil but good". the characters they like are men who are brutal to other people but not to the self-insert female lead character.

To Women,

I resent you. If you make anyone happy, it sure isn't guys like me. Demean me, ignore me and mistreat me all you feel you need to. But don't act like I need to like you for it. And don't act like you really think i'm a danger to you as a male if you're so careless about antagonizing me. You're not a victim from where I'm sitting. I look at you and I see an alienating awful person who lives by throwing guys like me under a bus. You don't deserve to be happy.

I am a stray animal. Unconnected and unwanted by a society that feels empty, shallow, aimless, and oppressive. I feel not more free than any prison inmate. I am welcome nowhere. I am wanted nowhere. I can't tell if I count as a person or what that even means to people. When i imagine you happy, I feel like there is something morally wrong with the world. Maybe that's why you aren't.

This post makes a really good point.

Women claim all the time to be afraid of men in general and incels in particular. But I've never had a woman actually ACT the way she would act if she really was afraid of me. They mainly act as if they are continually laughing in my face, even when they are totally silent. That doesn't seem like the way frightened people would act. Frightened people would try not to antagonize the people they are frightened OF.

Dear Anon,

Thanks for the nice words. ;_;
I just wish things would fucking work out right. But they don't. I hope you have a good day.

Kind words and wishes,

Dear Anon,

It is strange. It feels like a "have your cake and eat it too" kind of situation. 

With respect and good fortune to you,

Dear Anon,

>if youre comfortable,
I'm not comfortable to be honest. This website isn't exactly a safespace full of people wishing me good feelings. I suppose i could make a throwaway on discord if you post one.

Anxious and friendly,
-Anon

There's something strange about the ps2. I feel like most games today don't have that feel anymore. I miss it.

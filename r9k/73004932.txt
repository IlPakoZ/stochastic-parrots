i did it because i was incredibly dypshoric. i started hrt at 19 after being chronically in a state of dissociation and suicidal ideation since the onset of puberty 
i would stare at my feet for hours wondering when they would stop growing
i would stare at my dick when i was 9 hoping it would go away 
i was absolutely disgusted when i started growing body hair 
>>73005091
thanks :)

Because you have a mental disorder I am not going to tell you this and that because mental disorders are blinded by their own abuse. So instead I will just say

Where the hell are my keys? I've looked everywhere and cannot for the life of me find them

Can you tell us about your experience with starting HRT after puberty?
--- 73005348

I'm seriously wondering what is your real voice ?
Do you actively try to sound girly or it just come natural ?

it sucks, tbdesu, i mean i started at 19, which isnt AWFUL, (still possibiltiy of pelvic rotation/hip growth), and I was put on Adderall right before i turned 15 which has been shown to lower the potency of puberty which helped. and i was FAT during puberty which raises estrogen levels
but, transitioning after puberty is horrible. i constantly compare myself to youngshits (who started at like 12-15) and it ruins my day because of how good they look in comparison.
but, at the end of the day, i started at 19, and not like 30. 
>>73005418
wait real? cool :)
--- 73005465
>>73005433
Are the differences to starting in the 12-15 range really that significant? How important is 'passing' to you? Would you describe yourself as 'passing'?
--- 73005496
>>73005433
I'm trying not to fall into the "ywnbaw" but I am curious because yea, you will never be a woman, you'll always be a tranny, so why bother? Virtually nobody will ever see you as a woman, though they might pretend out of pity. No real homosexual women would date you because they're only attracted to women, same is true of men. 
>youngshits (who started at like 12-15)
Those poor groomed children, fucking hell.
--- 73005579
>>73005465
>differences
yes they are absolutely significant
the more puberty you go through => the more testosterone your body is exposed to => the less likely to pass
and its exponential
like id say 25 is a hard limit desu
after that it is very hard to pass
>how important
very. in this current political and social climate, i want nobody to be able to tell im trans
its a legitimate safety concern
>do i pass
no
>>73005496
like i said, dont bother
--- 73005602
Was there a certain point that you really got that you were trans or was it slow and gradually been sprouting in your head?

Would you tell a potential partner?
--- 73005645
>>73005579
What makes you say you don't pass? Has something happened in real life to make you think that? Or is there something about you that you see as a 'giveaway'?
--- 73005667
>>73005579
Seriously though, you will never be a woman, you'll always be a trans-woman. You'll always require that modifier, because you simply cannot become what you desire.

Could you tell us about the being gendered thing? Are you presenting as female and someone accidentally calls you "he" or "him"? Or do you mean a bigot has deliberately shouted abuse? What do you think provoked the misgendering?
--- 73005896

being called sir and what you said

Useful question for me: I'm a cis man and my voice is really high pitch (maybe a slightly more high pitch than your natural voice), I have been looking at FtM voice training things but if I do that, will I have to be forcing my voice all the time? If that is the case, I am not sure if I will have all the range of sounds that on needs while laughing, telling a story or whatever. Seems very restrictive.

Another option is to inject test or whatever, maybe I have low test idk but it seems dangerous as you can get infertile.
--- 73006012
>>73005960
>will I have to be forcing my voice all the time?
if you use it all the time, i don't think so
>maybe I have low test
get it tested friendo
--- 73006052
>>73005896
If you are presenting as female - ie long hair, women's clothes, etc - I can't believe someone would call you "sir" as an honest mistake. That sounds deliberate to me. What makes you think it was accidental / natural for them to see you as a man?
--- 73006064

Are your orgasms different from before? If you aren't a virgin, do you top or bottom? Is it pleasant or dysphoria inducing when a partner touches your penis?

It's not about being a woman. It's about looking like one for sexuality reasons and societal benefits. Only delusional trans people believe they are actually women. Most chill trans people know that'll never be the case, but they make do by functioning in society as much of a woman as possible which includes others threating them like they are one (if they pass well). No well adjusted transgender gets upset when you tell them they are never going to be a woman, because they know or should know by the time of HRT and surgeries. If they have not made peace with this, then no procedure will fix them. But most have. It's just the unfortunate case that the loud ones you associate with all transgender people are the mentally ill who either put no effort into passing or have unrealistic expectations of the proccess and then demand everyone to treat them like they pass when they don't. Most transpeople are not like that. They often "boymode" until they are 200% sure they can socially transition.

Yes, it is a mental illness. Yes, most transpeople know that. Yes, the bodily transitioning doesn't solve the body dysmorphia for everyone. However it eases it for most and it seems like transitioning with therapy is the best form of "treatment" for now. The treatment doesn't make anyone a woman. But if successful, it is close enough to live life socially as one.

And before you mention it. No, involving children is not okay. People who do that trans or not, should be jailed and made sure their inmates know why they are serving time.

Have you ever thought about detransitioning? Would your life be significantly different as a gay femboy than as a straight transwoman? What would the difference be?
--- 73006448
>>73006432
>Have you ever thought about detransitioning?
a few times, but the thought of ever masculinizing again scares the shit out of me, a few times i have run out of my blocker and it was terrible
i will never go on testosterone ever again
>Would your life be significantly different as a gay femboy than as a straight transwoman? 
the difference between living as a man vs a woman
being on testosterone vs being on estrogen

What would say is the border between like a cis man wanting to be a woman and a man that should transition. I feel I'm at that border. I did a few online tests for fun (I mean I did know I kinda wanted to be a woman since like 9) and like they generally diagnose me with like a slight indication of gender dysphoria, although occasionally they won't or will diagnose me with more serious dysphoria.

How do you feel about moving in with a man and being his slave? Nothing abusive and still a lot of intimacy but you'd be expected to do anything he says without hesitation.

I've started suffering from a weird condition. Internet and thinking about it gives me anxiety.
There's something scary about the modern internet compared to how it was in 2008. Now you're being watched, monitored, archived, everywhere you go. And the consequences of your posts can directly affect the rest of your life.
And it only seems to be getting worse every year. Every year social media is larger, has more power over real life, and companies implement new tech that is only used to monitor us.

It's gotten to a point I've considered the following alternatives
1. Stop using Internet altogether, just cut yourself off from humanity.
2. Build a safespace that only contains media from the safe years (1990-2012) and spend all your time in this time capsule

why don't you only make good posts and then no one will attack you for them

The internet since about 2013 is primarily a data-collecting project. What people say, buy, want, do, fear, etc is all collected en masse and fed through an algorithm system to pull statistics from specific demographics.

People who control that information can market directly to consumers in a way never dreamed before. Custom ads that play on a device they hold in their hands, that pop up when they're trying to read something else, that fucking print out on their receipt at the grocery store? It's literally the cyberpunk world without the cybernetic implants.

The fact people can save what you say and use it against you has always been true of print media, it's just that now everyone alive has a digital paper-trail going back tenyears. Anyone already has enough evidence to convict you of some social wrongdoing or faux pas if they read enough of your e-mails.

Good post.
The crazy part about the Internet in 2023 is that it's so crazy it sounds like a cyberpunk dystopia but it's real. Most people just reject it, they dont want to see it for what it truly is.

You make it sound like the smartest people are people who will stop using the Intenret

Whenever I think of the Internet as just a massive data hoarding project, I Feel sick and feel that I Want to go permanently offline

What scares me is that almost nobody on the Internet cares that at this point the Internet is nothing but a large data collection venture.
People ignore the dystopian truth and go back to having their cheap laughs and instant gratification. Some might invent a cope, but that's it.

Yeah it's bad.
It's to be point where you just need to either not care or not use the Internet that much. 

Ironically it hasn't made anything better. Those targeted ads don't ever get close to my actual interests. They're showing they don't know shit about us just because we clicked on something. And they'll shower you with whatever ads they want to, no amount of saying "I'm not interested" will stop them shilling the same products at the same time, because the marketing companies paid them to do it. 
During sportsball season, you'll see ads for sportsball regardless if you watch it or not. No amount of telling you don't like it will make it stop. Just an example. 

Also OP realize the fish-school-effect. You're a tiny fish in a large school. They can't go after every single person for every single little thing. So no one is really paying attention to your data until it's relevant to them.

Because normies weren't first adopters of the Internet. They were saying it was for nerds or weirdos. Until social media came along on their phones and provided a way to get sex/money from other people...
Then normies flooded the Internet... 

They never got the idea of privacy and anonominity online. They only care was themselves in real life and getting attention to their real life selves.

This. This is what I want people to realize. Tech evolves every day and we cheer, thinking everything's gonna get better somehow.
Nothing ever changes.
I was unironically reading books in the 90s and I dont see how finding information has gotten that much better thanks to the Internet. The Internet is the most overrated invention in history.

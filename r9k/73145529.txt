Is it over? Is this a woman's way of letting you down easy? Should I keep pursing, or should I give up?

If it's not a definite "yes," then it's over. Think about it logically. If you were thirsty, and someone offered you water, would you hesitate and say "maybe?" No, you would say yes. The situation is the same here. She doesn't want it. Leave her be.

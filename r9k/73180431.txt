If it's funny enough. Someone suggested suicide by catapult/trebuchet in a thread earlier and I would absolutely save the fuck out of that.

I recently watched a video of someone livestreaming their suicide. It was an Asian kid that blew his head off with a shotgun. He turned off the video so there was only audio of the actual suicide. You could hear the loud and then the blood dripping on the floor.

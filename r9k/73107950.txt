Any anons been homeless before? I might be homeless soon and need some tips. is it as bad as people make it out to be?
--- 73107984
No, but I've talked to a few people who have. Apparently socks are a big thing. Where are you going to be homeless? I live in an area with fucktons of homeless people. There's a nonprofit that drives around a van with a shower in it, and other such things.

I recommend you start learning from bushcraft youtubers. I highly, highly recommend you check out David Canterbury, US army veteran who gives advice on how to survive in the wilderness on the cheap. Being homeless is miserable, brother. People will wish you dead. Hope you will survive. Seriously man, check out his YouTube videos, they may save your life. Don't live in a homeless shelter or encampment, you will get stabbed, robbed, or shot

Don't sleep directly on the ground, always on a blanket or sleeping bag. When it gets cold your body heat can get sapped right out of you and you freeze to death by becoming an ice cream popsicle while you sleep.

Make sure you get plenty of water. Public libraries have water fountains and bathrooms. Make sure to brush your teeth, basic hygiene will help keep you sane.

Don't be afraid to take handouts, there might be shelters and soup kitchens around you. You can get meals and a place to sleep.

I've been semi-homeless, and by that I mean I lived in my car for a couple years. I usually stayed in the parking lot of one Walmart for a few nights, then another for a few, then back to the first. I waited tables or tended bar and took showers at the YMCA. Eventually I saved enough for a deposit and the first few months rent on an apartment and I was able to get out of my situation and get a better job. But like right out on the streets? Nah. In my city that would pretty much be suicide.

"surviving" out in the actual wilderness is literally JUST "surviving". it means pushing yourself to your maximum limits, physically and mentally, in a way you've never experienced in civilized society. it means eating like a few hundred calories a day and hiking away all of the calories you don't have. it means having your mind screaming at you to "go home, go get some fast food, go rest" all while you can't and are forced to just bear with it like some type of wild animal. 

living out in the wilderness is so much harder than people think it actually is. 

if you look at these survival challenge videos on youtube, they'll all typically say something along the lines of "3 days in the wilderness", "6 days in pouring rain" etc.. you'll notice there are hardly any "two months" in the wilderness videos or "one year" in the wilderness videos. that's because actual wilderness survival is seriously not sustainable and not something you can do long term. 

it's worth mentioning that the people who do last more than a few months (like on the show, "Alone") tend to come home weighing 40% lighter with some major health issues.

yeah, i have. i was homeless in youth homeless shelters for liek 3 or 4 months when i was 16 or 17, and only left because i was sent to jail and forced to live with my parents through diversion. this was because i had a unloving rough parents and undiagmosed autism (later got a diagnosis at 27). also i was homeless at 20 for 2-3 months in shelters as well

basically, its rough, but doable. i dont know about outside of shelters, but i heard its better. in shelters, you have to shower everyday, otherwise people WILL bully you hard, and real quick too. a lot of people there are fresh out of jail and dopedealers and shit

dont do drugs besides weed once in a blue moon if you feel inclined, never drink alcohol, be respectful, wear strong earplugs, take care of your hygene, and try to find something to do

i spend my time working, at the library everyday, walking a lot, etc

if ur outside, you can go to some housing agencies that will help you find some government housing system, a lot of places have that

did you ever get depressed, or were you busy enough with work and stuff?

before being diagnosed with crohns, I didn't sit for 4 months. I wasn't depressed, but thinning about it now makes me really sad.

ftom traveling to different cities, it seems like boredom is a big difficulty with being homeless. did you grapple with it?
--- 73108376
>>73108279
same questions to you as well
>>73108325
were you always thinking about what you were gonna do next?
could you usually find enough food to feel full?
how are you today? do you have a place to call home without the threat of being homeless again?
why did you go to jail (you dont have to answer it you dont want to)?
do you fear being homeless again?
was romance ever possible while homless?

I once crashed at some strangers home, in exchange for work. Guy had a spare room, and I got 3 meals a day. I had to help him with stuff like cleaning the house, cooking, working on his farm, etc. It was sorta like serfdom, and I wasn't allowed to have a fucking door to my room, but it was better than enduring winter in a tent city. Obviously it spared me from the cold and snow, and it was safer too, but it also let me tell people and potential employers that I was working on a farm and had a proper address, instead of telling them I was a NEET sleeping on the streets or some shelter. I'm telling you this just so you are aware of some other potential opportunities, although regrettably there's no reliable way to find things like that. Maybe try going to churches, and talking to people, offering to help around in exchange for room and food while you get your stuff together.

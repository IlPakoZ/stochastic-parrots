Yeah. They tend to be narcissist. Some are sociopaths. Many have a god complex. They have to try and act better than everyone else. My girl was from a small town in michigan north of Lansing. She was trying to talk down to this guy on a traffic stop, he gets out of his truck and she is TRYING to be a big man, and he quickly knocked her the fuck out.

I dated a lady cop for awhile yes, didn't know she was a cop until started dating. It was alright but she was highly stressed often, and prone to violence.

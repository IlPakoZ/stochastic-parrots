My last 6 months are cooked since I accidentally left one artist on shuffle while I slept. Have my last 4 weeks instead, and listen to more Jim Croce

Cool to see Jeff Rosenstock, I don't know many other people who listen to him :)

Unrelated, but if you like Joey/Tyler and you haven't, listen to some MF DOOM. Still trying to get a gague on how popular he is in the mainstream, but I'll shill the guy every chance I get. He made the beat and produced Joey's World Domination

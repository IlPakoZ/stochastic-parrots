Is it destruction you seek? Fire cares not what it burns... be sure you can control it before you unleash it.
--- 72996304
Or perhaps you desire stasis? It is natural to turn against the chill, but great power can be gained by those who embrace it.
--- 72996339
The explorer shogun, Gorg, is shameless. 
Why though?
Is it because she's a jiangshi?
Is it because of her weird immortality?
Did she die enough to lose all of that shame?

She looks at you on the spaceship.
Looking at her eyes. The challenge is.
"Welcome to mars" she said.
--- 72996372
Maybe you instead look to the skies? Coalesced energy unleashed all at once... the fury of the gods themselves taken into mans' own hands.
--- 72996394
Is it instead forbidden knowledge you desire? Be mindful that such things are forbidden with good reason. The fates loathe those who alter their loom, and the price of life is always steep.
--- 72996433
>>72996339
While I was landing on Mars, I could see the horizon from above.
On the left, it felt cold. The eerie aura was like metal, smells as metal.
On the right, it felt dirty. The sounds of sand could've heard from here, thunders and lightings were strong too.
--- 72996440

God, I want a bitch who can kick my ass.
--- 72996651
>>72996433
Such a perfect image doomed by legs.
--- 72996699
>>72996651
During the travel, Gorg talked about many things. 
One of those, were about a recent catastrophe. A sandstorm appeared and took away most of our sheeps. That's bad. Replacement should be harder now. 
However, suddenly, mechanical beings appeared from the coldest part of the planet. They just came and started acting on sheep's place. Roadrunners were the name that the researcher in charge gave to them. 
It was weird.
--- 72996704
>>72996699
Damn. I forgot the original image.
--- 72996725
Hi, everyone.

>>72996651
That's an incredible background, super cool drawing. What happens if you gen it again with the same seed but a higher or lower CFG?

I'm not saving the seeds. However, I can make sure for you that eyes start to break like on >>72996116 and >>72996079. I managed to fix legs with img2img, but face posture changes a bit, which annoys me a lot.

>>72996651
>>72996704
Reports about the sheep massacre mentions that the sandstorm itself managed to target some of them. However, a lot of them were just left there crushed. wet and pee weren't uncommon on those whose body was intact somehow.
--- 72996807
Pretty good hands for once

>>72996775
Kypsiee hiiiii :>
--- 72996842
>>72996775
>>72996807
Welcome back! Let me jump at you!

>>72996784
The most suspect one for this was Hornette. She, indeed, was able to naturally enter in sandstorms. 
She, indeed, was able to hide herself from our observations while on there. 
But what if it was her? Murder is an option?
Can we even kill her? If she sits wrong, the entire course of the planet is changed. Such a robust being can't just be fight over and expect the consequences be positive. We need a plan.
--- 72996867
I can't stop daydreaming about her when I'm supposed to be listening to people.
>>72996831
Helllloooooo!
--- 72996898
total millionaire extremist vblast project bomb the anthrax go NOW!
--- 72996907
And I shall sleep now.

Since you guys played around with cockpits a while ago, I decided to make Gorg try it too. It's impossible for Hornette you know. She'd destroy it.
>(cockpit, piloting, spacecraft, sitting, thighs, straight-on, airplane interior, cable, wire, seat:1.5), (purple theme, orange theme, rain, storm, thunder:1.4), (patterns), 
>>72996867
>I can't stop daydreaming 
This summarizes the entire lack of productivity in my job I'm facing those days.
--- 72996915
>>72996867
Kypsie at her natural habitat. She going home?
--- 72996923
>>72996907
Have a good night, hope to see you soon.
--- 72996934
>>72996907
sleep well gorg, see you around :))
--- 72996949
>>72996907
Godnight marsfren!
>>72996915
Oh boy. If she ever asked to go home... I don't know how I'd break it to her.
--- 72996977
>>72996949
Maybe home isn't fully gone though
--- 72997087
Maybe we can go back soon. I sure hope so
--- 72997104
Does the History do anything? If I delete the ones I don't like and only leave the good ones will it reference those, and make them similar?
--- 72997112
>>72997087
hopefully Kypsie can make it before climate change does
--- 72997149
>>72997104
It's just in case you want to go back to one. It doesn't reference them. I find it useful sometimes when Im gamin' because I can put my phone on my lap and everytime I die I can click the blue gen button until in between matches where I can check if I got any good ones and make adjustments. But yeah, it only "references" the prompts you put.
--- 72997176
I'm heading out now. Cya gentlemen some other time!
--- 72997181
>"Anon you promised you would let me clean up and dry off when you got back from work! I'm still soaked, and I stink of sweat from Goa's sauna!"

But I'm lazy and I would have to change my prompts...

>>72997176
see you around :))

>>72997181
helo Saeriah :))
--- 72997307
Shame I haven't been able to post much lately, and this will be all I can really post for now too. But I've been in a milfy mood, so have some milf Rochelle.
--- 72997317
>>72997227
I like what's going on in her hair.
Will I be judged for disloyalty to my waifu? I feel like trying something new.
--- 72997329
I think I'll go back and forth between BoS Hana and Desert Ranger Hana tonight.

I figured something like Baby's Got Back might be fun
--- 72997932
I'm going to try adding "holding science fiction weapon" in order to give her a fallout looking gun. This way I can hand-waive how mangled it looks as being a futuristic design. Giving waifu a big iron!

>>72997887
Admittedly, I still have ambition for worldly acclaim, but if I was the one she loved, maybe I'd be content.

Powered Armor Hana is not having a good day.
--- 72999187
I'm going to have her visiting the most famous places from the game now. So here's Hana at hoover dam.
--- 72999332
Maybe I should learn something new
--- 72999353
Apparently this is what the AI thinks (((hoover dam))) is.

>>72999332
What are you thinking of learning?
--- 72999409
>>72999353
I dunno maybe start learning a language, or doing something with hands
--- 72999473
Now this looks like a dam. Poor Hana needs to use a stimpak on her arm though.

>>72999409
I would recommend painting or playing an instrument; both are very rewarding.
--- 72999588
>>72999409
Like Hana anon said I do recommend picking up an instrument. I play guitar myself so I can't say the same for other instruments but it really is a rewarding feeling to see how far you've come compared to when you first started
--- 72999775

I will consider it. I actually want to play a piano, but I'm not in a right apartment for it

I'm kind of sorry, but all of mines are weird to interact with.
Hornette, for example, has hips and waist that weight a magnetar itself. She can and she'll crush you.
--- 73000404
>>73000069
>>73000392
Coyote, otherwise, can't even be touched normally. She's a sandstorm, so the only way she communicates phisically is by electricity. 
Also, I just realized I didn't gen so much for her and I'm lacking images is a shame.
--- 73000428
>>73000069
>>73000392
>>73000404
Roadrunner, though, is relatively safe. She was designed for reproduction, after all. However, she's all cold below and wouldn't really feel interested on doing something that requires spending more energy than her target.
More like, she'd appreciate if you straddle on her mouth instead, with all you force.
--- 73000490
>>73000069
>>73000392
>>73000404
>>73000428
That said, Gorg seems relatively fine. She's not so problematic as the others. However, being a Jiangshi, you should be careful with your qi. 
This reminds me. I need to gen her walking like a zombie later.
--- 73000668
This is a voice I used to hear (i'm a diagnosed schizophrenic) that would protect me from the bad voices. I haven't heard her sweet, melodic voice in many a year but I miss her and we used to have a thing together. The fact that she isn't 'fictional' per se means she wasn't just a waifu for me, but an actual companion, even if she was only in my head and visual hallucinations. Might post some more
--- 73000733
Very original and traditional Gorg.

Here, let me translate her for all of you

>"If I was to be shipped with Gorgon, the pairing would be called GorgonGoa and that almost sounds like gorgonzola, which is a type of cheese. Based on this we can summarize that if I were to touch cunnies with Gorgon, and then we were to pull away from each other, there would be a few string of pussy juice that would connect us until our crotches become so far apart that the string of gooey juico de vagene breaks"

Thanks you for coming to her Ted Talk

This is giving me very interesting ideas...

Sounds like a more reasonable ideal. She basically wants a strong, smart man who's into her and will protect her whilst giving her space and being independent. I highly doubt those are her standards for a guy.

Yeah, she's fucking delusional. 
She wants a tall, charismatic genius, with a big cock that is obsessed with her and has the looks of a Disney prince. 
I don't get the shadow part, wtf is that about?

There are some things that are salvageable, and tgat I find reasonable, some that I even fit or aspire to. But that's way too much.

a man probably wrote that in order to blackpill the incels that lurk there. words like "tingles" give it away

Yes

And I'd say it would be a nightmare for them if they ever woke up, but I think on average that they are not even capable of it.

Meanwhile a lot of guys are:
>Don't be fat
AND THAT just that will get you as unperson'd as a bunch of fat bitches can muster.
Going on and on about modern beauty standards while more of them are FAT than ever before.

Because women OBJECTIFY man instead of seeing him for who he is. They have a long list because they of their DEMANDS, not because of how they adjust to what men are, or have the potential for. They do not UNDERSTAND us.

And guess what? Somehow you're the one being entitled. Go figure

Western culture gives them full freedom but like children who never earned anything, they lack respect for their male counterparts. As a collective women are the entitled ones, not men. They are NOT oppressed in anything. We're going to have to endure this Bizarre situation because women do not have any respect for male life anymore.

Honestly I don't think all women are like this, but the vast majority of westernized women do seem like they're there if not close to it.

To me it just seems like they use their victim ploys to shut down guys they find unattractive or less attractive, and it seems that, for at least some of them, It's a subconscious thing. Decent/better looking women seem to do this less than many of the uglier ones for some reason

Look into SK women, they're even worse somehow.
--- 72986644
>>72986515
Alright "modern" women then?
Yeah sk women seem obnoxious. High class chinese and Indians too, pretty much any woman that thinks she's fancy or deserves a lot just for existing
--- 72986675
>>72986644
Chinese and Indian women care about money first and foremost. Jap women are undercover whores given their culture of throwing sex jobs at literally every girl they come across.

Funniest part is she's probably some 3/10 fat chick who thinks her "winning personality" (watching netflix and eating sushi) will win gigachad over.
--- 72986776
>>72984451 (OP)
She didn't need to write all that, since she's willing to overlook everything else if you were tall and had a good face. If you weren't tall and didn't have a good face, it doesn't matter if you check every other box, she wouldn't be into you. Therefore, that is what the standard is.

i'm not reading all of that, but i'm guessing that i don't fit the description based on the fact that i'm a KHHV. i just want a wife that's around my age and doesn't have downsyndrome. they don't match with me on dating apps anyway, and it's negotiable as to whether i'd date if their personalities are to my liking. 
inb4 there ARE NO girls with good personalities.

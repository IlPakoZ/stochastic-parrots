It is pretty aids, half the threads on r9k are started by mentally ill asians racebaiting. It's not even funny or original, just unadultered insecurity and mental illness.

no they aren't lol, but i'd like to believe it's not a coordinated attack. ofc they don't deserve the hate, but it's kind of obvious they're trying to sneak into everything. you can look up the most random anything you can think of, search for it on any search engine, and the chance that you get some random koreans laughing or looking cute will be in your results. i'll take that over queen of spade cuckbait anyday.

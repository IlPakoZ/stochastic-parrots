So...
>chick had crush on me
>I was pretty neutral about it
>we didn't hang out that much, but texted every day
>pretty, but idk. I don't THINK I had feelings back. I was confused how I felt towards her
>eventually she ghosts me and then I said don't text me back since it made me feel like crap
>haven't talked to her in 2 years
>she's single
>I don't think I want a romantic relationship, but I miss her
>Feel lonely as shit. Suicidal. Can't be alone right now. I'm introverted so I don't typically talk to people. I just want to talk with her again.

Btw.. we knew each other for like a few months prior to texting each other (ex coworker)

another thing.. idk how she's feeling. For instance what if she's happy and I open up a wound by talking to her again?

I mean , it seems like you really want to do it so go for it.
I'd warn you you're only doing this out of desperation though , it doesn't seem like you ever had any real desire for her.
Don't get your hopes up either , women move on very very fast and she's likely already forgotten you in any romantic sort of way.

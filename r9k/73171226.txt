What are some female dominated hobbies that I won't want to kill myself for doing. My problem is that I don't meet enough people. Even using a hobby to build up friendships is fine because it will extend my network and increase my chance of getting a gf.

Sucking dick in an alley and letting chad pound you in the ass is a female hobby

Young people mostly don't have public, social hobbies, you might meet some nice old ladies if you sign up for some classes in sewing or cooking at your local community centre. Basically everybody under 40 just has solo hobbies like "hiking" or "watching true crime documentaries".

Knitting or crocheting, and you get cool scarves out of it. Cooking is based. Check any local community centers for public gardening plots or arts classes; I always see the plots here swarming with women and fine arts attract them like a magnet. Dance will keep you active and make you care less about if you look silly or not. If you do ballroom, you will get partners and I have never met a person who regretted learning it. Yoga can work, but it's less interactive so you'll have to be okay talking to people before and after sessions, prepare for a lot of crystal hippies and basic bitches. There's also jogging and cycling groups that can have a lot of women. Oh, and rock climbing.

Joining any of these groups will either have you exclusively meeting 60 year old women, or if the group is predominantly young women, you'll be viewed as a predator/creep. Alternatively, they'll all be there to fuck the coach in charge if it's a fitness based group and he'll be running it as his harem.

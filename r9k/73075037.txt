why do men change so much after they settle down with a woman?
--- 73075045
Relationships quite literally change men neurochemically. Especially if they have kids with the chick
--- 73075081
Mating inducing changes in neurology, endocrinology, behavior, etc. is pretty common across species. Which makes perfect sense, adapting to have a higher chance of successfully raising offspring is literally reproductive fitness

often time they'll change because they want to avoid offending the wife. It's the same as being tamed, I think.

It's mostly because their social circles change, they don't hang out with other single males

The prioritization of independence implied by the typically negative connotation of being "tamed" *is* literally maladaptive if you're now responsible for ensuring the welfare of a group of people and not just yourself, thoughever. Maybe dogs are a good example; though they were in some sense cucked by being domesticated it produced a symbiotic relationship between our two species to our mutual advantage (also, talk about lucking out evolutionarily that in exchange for a few thousand years of maintaining vigil around our camps at night and helping us hunt that they're now the beloved allies of the species that took over the entire planet)

You testosterone drops a good degree after wife for a few years and then having a kid

I honestly think it's just a type of guy. Some people get married and stay about as they were, other do radical shifts in personality. I think the heart of it was were they doing what they were doing for the sake of it or was getting a mate/starting a family unit part of what drive them?

Fembots: picture this,
You're 35. You've been dating a man. He's good looking, he's got the money, he's got the ring, and he's asking you to marry him, BUT:
>He's full-on submissive in every way imaginable
... He not only wants you to be on top in bed, but he also wants you to make every decision of any importance in the relationship; for example, where you'll go on dates, what you'll watch together on TV, and who you'll socialize with.
Now, let's spice it up:
>We're in the 1950s
We're in the 1950s so if you divorce him you don't get his assets just a very meagre amount of alimony.
Given ALL of the facts above, do you marry the submissive, or no?

Fuck no. Men are supposed to be dominant. Being submissive is extremely unattractive.

You should realise by now that when women say they're strong and independent, and feminism is about breaking gender roles, they mean they slut around. They don't actually mean they want to be independent, assertive or anything. They still want to be absolutely dominated by men in every possible way.

What the fuck you ball busting bitch I get women complimenting my face and smacking my butt all the time, so you're saying you're gonna reject me just because I am submissive even though I'm 12458135x better looking than the dominant sea urchins you go on dates with? Fuck you, I deserve better.

Yeah.... Right... Uh huh

Let me try to explain to you. Submissive guy is like a kid that you can fuck. While from the surface the idea seems attractive to many sociopathic femanons like myself, in reality. It becomes tiresome. It basically is like living in a lie. You could just get strong, stupid man. aka chad. I guess. Then top him and tell him if he won't, you'll leave him. Living under the thought of being murdered is extra thrill for psycho femanons like me.

You now understand why "submissive" man is not exactly that attractive. Women love to "reshape" or heal, whatever their men. Women are ambitious like that. When a man offers himself like that on flat plate, it's sort of boring and like fuckin a kid.

But this changed all
>50s
Yeah, awesome. I'd be like Marilyn Monroe. Would be fun to push the guy around, him wearing that suit, fedora and him being all fidgety. I like the idea. But in today's world. It would be just meh.

This, maybe feminism started with good intentions, but functionally it's been very gynocentric. In the last 10+ years it's been about getting rid of difficult female gender roles while retaining difficult male gender roles. 

Women basically just want to get rid of the stigma of sleeping around, while also forcing men to still be the emotional rock, make more money etc.

Good job Anon, top of the catalogue. You were falling behind a bit there. Could have used a nicer photo, but maybe it's a traffic tactic?

But being dominant scares me. Just the thought of being in control makes me feel bad...
I'm not cut out for this "not dying alone" thing.

--- 73046926
Fuck yes. He's perfect.

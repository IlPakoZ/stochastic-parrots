how do i make myself asexual? is asexuality even real?
--- 73093793
Yep. Nofap 3 months or more take the Christ pill and start working out. Doesnt just get rid of sexual thoughts also helps with controlling emotions especially anger and makes you less anxious

It is but it's either a genetic predisposition or induced by trauma
You don't need to become an asexual. Google sex addiction.

nofap and working out will make you even hornier
if you really want to be "asexual" just jack it every day until you can't cum anymore. after repeating that for a while, you won't even think about sex outside of jerk sessions.

Don't consume and you are free.

Trauma worked for me

The state of modern women is enough to drive someone asexual... I've so given up.

Losing your sexual desire won't help you lose your romantic desire. The loneliness will still be crippling.

Not possible unless you're female.

It's real but not for females. They cling onto things and labels as an aesthetic because it's what they're biologically wired to do (not their fault).

you can remove your desire for sex if you remove sex hormones in your blood

you can never remove your desire for love unless maybe you meditate 12 hours a day for the rest of your life and seek a path of not wanting anything, but even then its questionable

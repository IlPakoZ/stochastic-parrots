It was even worse to let men vote. History shows that men evolved to be slaves, not policy makers.

Technically true, but not necessarily the cause. I agree that it was a bad choice, giving blacks the right to vote was bad too, but giving men the right to vote was too if you extent the logic. Imperialism is sound, but was stale and was shitty too, and anarchy doesn't work for more than a few years. I guess that all systems will grow stale after a while, some faster than others, but that would mean that constant wars for power would be the right choice. So I have no idea, but you can't prove anything, I think you are right, but I overthinking every single thing, so I better stop.

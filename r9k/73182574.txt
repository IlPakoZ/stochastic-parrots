My gf knows I was a socially stunted virgin before I met her.

How'd she feel about it?

considering you got a gf, i suppose the past ceases to matter

So you're still a socially stunted autist, just not a virgin anymore. OR did having a gf get you friends as well? Perhaps sill a virgin as well if she didn't let you hit

She was very understanding. Also patient with my lack of experience in relationship/sexual matters

It was the opposite, having friends got me the gf. I made a really good impression on her the first night because I introduced her to a bunch of people and danced with her. But once we went on a date she realized I was awkward and quiet

see you in three months when you complain about your gf slowly ghosting you or turning out to be a BPDemon.
unless you're some fucking 18 year old normie who hung out here trying to be edgy counter culture

Ghosting seems more likely. She doesn't seem to have any mental issues, it's been 3 months and nothing cropped up yet

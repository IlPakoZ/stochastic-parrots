women really like good looking men and money
women are too superficial and shallow
this man is a south korean actor who is 20 years older than this woman
and this woman is japanese and the head of a department of japan's largest toy company
in short, this woman is a good looking and highly paid career woman
still, she married a man 20 years older than her, just because he's good looking and famous
i am sure more than 90 % of women have no shame like her

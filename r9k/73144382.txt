Why don't we make danish the official international language?
--- 73144396
because it is an ugly language spoken by ugly people of which there are only about a dozen.

english is the international language for a reason. it's the language of business because it allows for much more accuracy than any other language. consider the following phrase:
index finger
anyone well versed in the english language knows exactly what this means. in some languages, the rough translation to this is "first hand hand" like wtf?

Can you describe what about the sound you don't like?

I've always felt a little bad about being a native english speaker because you're never really forced to pickup a second language like so many people from around the world who pick up english ontop of their native language. There's almost no point unless you plan to leave the country and live somewhere else, and there's so many languages to choose from that are all fairly pointless compared to learning english

yes, it is that noise that is made when a danish person uses their mouth, lungs, and throat to create noise.

>mouth, lungs, and throat
That is what everyone uses when they talk.

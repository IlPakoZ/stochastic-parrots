Yes, i have used many illegal drugs.
Yes, i am aware of the risks, and realize it has its negatives.
No, i dont need to explain why i do it. Just like noone is expected to have to explain why they must eat fast food, the tranny would feel unacceptably dehumanized constantly having to explain why they are transitioning, and the whore is not expected to explain why they are so loose.

I will try to get better and get to a point where i dont need these things to feel right, but if i fall and find myself needing a fix then that is just what i felt i needed. 

I have no shame and there is no reason i should when i live in a world where fast food and large scale meat factory farming exists, all human interaction is shallow, people are heroes for taking dangerous hormones to try to change their gender, and rockstars and public idols are deified for doing the same things i do.

I agree, also people that dont do drugs dont have the soirit of adventure or even an ounce of curiosity they are golems.

And I hate that talking point as much as you do. Also you do you boo, some drugs are way safer and less addictive than coffee or sugar, yet guess which ones are legal.

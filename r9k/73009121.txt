I've been getting bouts of extreme dandruff/scalp itchiness, and when I itch my hairline hard enough it doesn't come back. So now I have an uneven hairline, but no balding. Fucking sucks.

A study came out linking soda consumption to baldness. So you should try cutting out sugary drinks entirely, everything, and all caffeinated drinks as well. Stress will also cause baldness, so try to stop stressing. Also if anons say it takes more than a year to work, just continue on with fin for another 6 months and see how it shakes out.

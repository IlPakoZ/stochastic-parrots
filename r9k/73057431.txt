I just went to a small festival, about 200 people, themed around psychedelic electronic music, LSD and weed. As an ex music producer, attractive, healthy, mid 30s, somewhat funny, stable job, house, luxery cars, and friends; i feel somewhat disappointed in my ability to take social interactions to the next level. There were a number of attractive loaner outdoorsy girls that i enjoyed talking to, but at the end of the day, i go back to the tent, go home, etc and what was it all for?

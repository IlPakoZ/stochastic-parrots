Fucking tinder sluts feels so inadequate now.

Back in the days in which I fapped to porn, gooning always seemed hot when I was horny but when I wasn't it just seemed creepy, sad, and impracticable. Also, the porn gooners fap to is like the worst porn out there. Plastic bimbos and trannies? No thanks.

best thing I ever did was chemically castrate myself to remove my male sex drive
a literal curse.
--- 73127828
>>73127801
I only watch POV, VR, JOI, solo, lesbian, etc. Vanilla guy on girl was always a turn off. Trannies are fine, not particularly good or bad (assuming they actually pass) I do love plastic porn bimbos though.

Back in my day it was called masturbatorium. Also what vibrators you use? I cant find the right one.
--- 73127853
>>73127839
I just have a generic wand victator, which I use to massage my head and frenulum
--- 73127863
>>73127828
I don't get how plastic bimbos are attractive. Realistic looking girls are the absolute best. And I'm not even saying ugly fat chicks (though a little weight can be okay). I just want normal looking women. Regardless, I haven't fapped to porn in two months and have no intention of going back.

No, I didn't get too far into the masturbation game before I had to go for real pussy.

>start jerking off using PSP, reading H manga on doujinmoe
>eventually get a PC and start on actual porn
>years pass and I'm in college and now I'm collecting JAV and categorizing it, several hard drives so I can have an optimal fapping experience.
>jerking off every day my dick gets sore, get the highest end Japanese pocket pussies and quality lubes. Pretty much needed it for medical reasons to keep my cock nice and healthy.
>tear up my first Tomax venus clone, had to buy a second one from too rough of fucking.
>still horny afterwards, end up losing my mind like a rutting animal and asking out coworkers with the explicit purpose of fucking.
Then I lost my virginity at 24. Got rid of all the stuff since I hardly used it after that.

To each their own. My tastes change from month to month. I've just been on a huge bimbo kick lately.

I have goon clothes specifically for gooning but i want a cave so bad :(
--- 73128145
>>73128101
Nope.
>>73128132
You kinda need your own place.
--- 73128159
>>73127746 (OP)
Dont people get bored of fapping or am I just low T with shit libido? I can't have a fap streak for even a weak if I literally have nothing else to do.
--- 73128167
i have sex with my girlfriend who loves me

All this money spent on luxury items and you will still never feel skin on skin contact and have pheromones and hormones release through your body naturally
--- 73128214
>>73128181
>Skin on skin
No but it's pretty close. I'm just looking to coom.
>>73128181
>Pheremones
Still not worth it.

What the fuck is that sub 

I thought r9k was more nofap than profap
--- 73128243
>>73127746 (OP)
some ppl have way too much time on their hands and zero ambition or pussy, huh. Porn can be nice, and I jack off plenty, but it'll never be as much fun as cuddling and watching anime with someone cute.

Ofc the incel is content with dying alone from poor health

I feel perfectly healthy. What do you mean?

Casual sex is overrated. Sorry.

I have my own place but people visit too often
--- 73128303
>>73128287
Oh I have my own place too. I just keep all my coomer stuff in a chest under my bed. Can you not control when people visit or something?
--- 73128314
>>73127853
I prefer deep muscle massager, it has stronger and deeper vibrations, I find it much more pleasurable on the head.
I actually meant to ask about prostate massagers, most are too strong or big for me, I cant enjoy it.
--- 73128316
>>73128303
Oh that's true. But id love to have a room that just constantly has images up
--- 73128341

Mine aren't big either. I just use lots oolf lube. It is possible to massage your prostate externally if you want.
>>73128316
Same. But I can't unfortunately. I just printed my pics and put them in sheet protectors. I take them down the morning after my goon session when I'm cleaning up. Ideally your gooncave would require as little setup as possible.

What jobs do robots have? I know most are NEETs, but surely there are at least a few others in some form of gainful employment? Do you enjoy what you do? 
I'm stuck at the moment, I hate my current job/career, but have zero idea what it is that I actually want to do with my life. I guess I'm in a decent position as I still live at home, so I have a good amount of savings, but feel like I need to do something soon as otherwise I'll just end up stuck in this job forever, and quite frankly in that case I'd rather just NEET out on my savings then rope.

I can't imagine literally sitting and rotting my entire life, pretty sad. That being said still better than slaving at mcwagies or something.

i work the night crew at a grocery store. don't really love it but the pay is good and i get to wear headphones all night. i work from 10:30pm to 6:30am and you only work with 5 other people max on a busy night. 

definetly a temporary position but works good to save money and gives you a real excuse to be up all night in your spare time

I am a geoscientist and I study volacanos. Its a comfy job but the pay isn't much.
> I hate my current job/career, but have zero idea what it is that I actually want to do with my life.
Figure out what you want to do and stake your life on trying to get there. I hated my IT job so much I went back to school to get the degrees I needed to study volcanos because I was autistically into them

As an undiagnosed autist who sperged out during my single year of wage-cucking and lost his second job after just a week, my 17 years of NEETdom make a lot more sense when I realised I was neuro-divergent. All the years of NEETdom shielded me from just how incompatible I am with the wagie world. I have concluded that it is impossible for me to exist in this piece of shit service economy (I cannot bear dealing with phones and customers), which has been gutted and sent to Red China, but they have merged and outsourced all the comfy back-office jobs that I could have potentially have done and even been great at. Even WFH would be infinitely better for me, but a lot of other people want that. All these post-2008 jobs are so fucking unappealing and they always have deal-breakers for autists. No wonder almost 80% of us are NEET. Seems like data entry is the most tolerable job for autists, but they always say these are the first jobs to be cut, so we'd be forever job-hopping on shitty wages. I just want a fucking UBI, so I can stay the fuck home and rot in peace. I realised years ago that NEETing as a hermit is the only way I can survive and keep some sanity and stability, as working and having to deal with normies would actually make my mental health much worse at this point.

Sounds /comfy/, not for me but glad you're enjoying it. Pay isn't everything, I'd rather have a job I genuinely enjoy that doesn't pay much. I guess I'm probably about where you were at before you decided to jack your old job in, even work in IT as well, except I have zero idea what it is I want to do long-term. I guess I enjoy fiddling with engines, though not enough to turn it into a career. It feels like there a quite a few things that I enjoy at a hobby level, but feel if I pursued a career I'd just end up back where I am right now, as that's how I got into IT.

Yeah, service industry is a load of wank, that's probably the main reason I hate my current job, though there are others that prevent me from trying to get a back-office sysadmin position or similar. Data entry or similar would bore me to death, I guess I do like not having to do the same thing all the time, which is why I hate NEETing so much. I think that even if you did find a back-office job like data entry you'd still have to deal with normies though, just instead of customers it would be some middle management bitch (invariably they are all foids) trying to make your life hell because you don't fit in (see the R*ddit post of the roastie who lodged HR complaints against some autist who didn't participate in office social bullshit). That's one benefit of IT I guess, since it requires a degree of competence the field is full of men, meaning you actually have a hope in hell of getting a dude as your manager, which is generally pretty sweet.

I'm a train driver apprentice. So far I've been sitting through lectures where the lecturers don't know what they have to teach us because nobody told them and sometimes they take us for a 20km walk around the railyard to look around. I also have to walk 2km to and back from the school. If nothing else my fat ass might get in shape.

I don't have a job though I kinda want to be a mechanic. Still not gonna get into that because the government is banning cars soon anyways so in 15 years that job will be dead anyways

Exactly the reason I'm hesitant about getting into anything engine related. I guess as a heavy diesel mechanic you probably wouldn't have anything to worry about, I don't see construction vehicles making the switch to electric anytime soon, and it's not exactly a popular field anyway so won't be too much competition.

Indeed. I suppose I'd like some variance, but it's impossible to know how much comes with the job from the outset. I'd rather do three things brilliantly, than twenty things badly. Sadly, the latter is what they expect now. You're right that I'd probably have to deal with some bitchy foid who thinks I am lower than shit, but that's why I'd much prefer WFH. My single year of wage-cucking was in an office largely consisting of foids. All of the bad, none of the good.
I did see that foid's post; they are so utterly insane. Normies are cancer to me. IT sounds good in principle, but I also never wanted to fall for the meme of student debt, seeing as jobs are anything but guaranteed. The gamble is just too big. This is why I would want something that is very low stress, if anything. Some years back I figured that I could make the finances work on three days a week. Sadly, not many tolerable jobs with those hours are advertised.
Then there's the issue of possibly being 'promoted' into a full time position. I don't want that. The devalued money is not worth the extra bother. I am done with it.

I guess if you did want to get into It you wouldn't need student debt, if you could get some certs. They do cost, but nowhere near as much as uni does. That said, I have no certs whatsoever which probably doesnt help me out, but since jobs in tech are so rare in my area it's difficult to get the motivation to do them when there are no jobs that require them. 
If you do go for a 3 day position then I wouldn't be worried about being promoted out of it, as long as you make it clear that you have no intentions of doing more. If they do then "promote" you you can just quit, or threaten to quit to get your hours back down. Not as easy as it sounds, I know, but it's an option.

Suppose that's true but I'm not really a heavy machinery diesel type of guy, more passionate about sports cars and tuning. Guess I'll pick it up as a hobby and get some regular boring job I hate

I am a paper pusher at a car dealership right now, working with inventory invoices and shit. It fucking sucks but I need the cash, gonna ask to either transfer over to IT or some shit by the end of the year or just get another job.

>>73148661 (OP)
Im somewhere in between a super wagie and a NEET.
I work 12 hours daily for 6 weeks (including weekends). After which i have 6 weeks of vacation, with a pocket full of gold. Shits pretty cash, i like my job and i am essentially halfway retired.

I dont think you lads realise how tranferable these skills are. I get constant job offers from industries i know jack shit about, but i have mechanical/electrical knowledge and there is a massive shortage of skilled labour rn

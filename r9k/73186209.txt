How can women have so poor an understanding of what men want?
Men want either a feminine girl (sweet, caring, nurturing, docile) or a down to earth and chill tomboy with nice interests
They want either a woman that enhances her body in feminine ways or a tomboy who just dont care and dresses comfortably
They want virgins or low body count girls or girls that had not done casual sex
Yeat what women do?
They paint their hair hideous colors, they become drama queens, they become easoly beligerant and discuss in a inflamed way about topics they feel a lot about but dont know a lot about, they ruin their body with tattoos and piercings, they even boast about having fucked a lot of guys as if we were to be impressed and charmed by that
Its the complete opposite in every way, theres scarcely anything attractive about women today besides the fact they have pussy and tits and ass

Women don't want to have to fit themselves into the narrow confines that traditional society tolerates for them

Which is pretty understandable. Just sucks that they then turn around and demand that men shove ourselves into the same narrow boxes that women rebel against, rather than being more tolerant since they themselves know how bad it can be.

Bullshit

Well they cheat on them or give them a black eye too and the women stay, is not like women dating you amount to much so far as being a well rounded person goes, often quite the opposite, so theres no real reason to compare oncels to badboys, they are both broken in different ways, but one of them the women liek because they are all broken

You are just as retarded, except you don't even pretend to not be misogynistic and have socially liberal ideals. You are just shamelessly an apathetic person. 
And on top of that you're ugly and don't know how to make a woman orgasm.

All men are the same. Yes, even you, who thinks you're intelligent and unique. You're not, you're dumb and retarded and have moid brain. If I'm going to put up with men I'm at least going to put up with the one that has a pretty face lul.

Plenty of us would be fine even without any sex, it's not "men just want a hole", it's "the few women females see as desirable and acceptable often just want a hole". Plenty of guys don't buy into that hoe/wife dichotomy bs - but then, nothing's less desirable to the women who complain about that sort of thing than a male feminist who agrees with the complaints

Yeah, it's called madonna-whore complex and modern men need to overcome it. We need to stop incentivizing women to become whores and hold other men accountable for being simps. Anything else is just hypocritical, you can't watch porn or have casual sex and complain about sexual degeneracy in society.

Women like bad boys because they aren't doormats and they are confident, that doesn't mean they like being disrespected and abused. The problem is boys are growing up being taught that masculinity is bad and having their masculine nature shamed in schools and at home, they either rebel against that and become bad boys and embrace the violent confident side of masculinity or they cuck and become nice guy doormats and male feminists. Men who are strong, confident, and assertive but use those qualities for benevolent things are exceedingly rare but those men are the highest valued by women.

I mean, did you ever tell him any of that? Did he make no effort to do better even if made aware of it? I get that it can be annoying but if a guy is literally just not raised with being taught to do stuff, it's not always obvious. Weaponized incompetence is a thing, but, like, did he actually have a chance to do better and still fucked it up/refused to do better?
>also he would call himself a leftist and whatnot but every now and then there would be a little comment that would remind me he's still moid brain and doesn't understand half the things he propagates.

Son of a model with plenty of similarly attractive relatives here. I browse this place for fun sometimed and I got into it because I felt unattractive when I was around 16 because puberty hit my looks very very late for whatever reason. With that out of the way, here's what I wanted to say:

Incels and Chads believe the same thing. Actually, Chads probably disrespect and dislike modern women more than incels. My Dad used to be a huge player that spent years with different women and he still had and stoll has very incel-esque views with "toxic" qualities like over the top jealousy, control over his wife/partner etc. Most of my male relatives are even worse, no incel can top the amount of shit talked about women that a Chad fucking multiple women drops on a daily basis in private. Chads acting differently in public is literally just an act to get laid, just like incels don't spew this shit outside to not be called misogynists or whatever.

Wives and holes are very different and genuinely believing that men don't care about sexual purity or other traditional values in women is utterly delusional and the result of being slightly better than obese virgins which makes you believe you have a superior understanding of modern dating, but you really do not and will never.

>>73186475
>eating women out
I've fingered and spent a lot of time kissing etc with girls before initiating anything more but I don't think eating girls out is common, I've never done it and have yet to see someone that has.
>all men are intrinsically misogynistic
Yesn't. In the way you mean it, probably since most women are worthless holes to us, but they still love their wives and would die for them.
--- 73186518

They want their ideal man to have the sociopathic violent behaviours of felons - just not in a felon's body but in a super-attractive multi-millionaire's body instead. They also want him to make a special exception in his behaviour for them specifcally because he "luvs me so much &lt;3 &lt;3".

No woman wants a man who's soft, or even one who's tough but non-confrontational.
--- 73186540
>>73186500
A lot of the fanfiction I've seen is some really brutal kink/bdsm/power dynamic stuff, often with self insert female characters getting dominated by guys who do a sort of sweet but creepily possessive, "bad boy with a heart of gold" (but in actuality he just has major mood swings and poor emotional regulation but sometimes shows remorse) type of thing. Not really much of the sappy romance stuff. Seems like more of it leans into the "dude kidnaps woman and Stockholm syndromes her into loving her" thing basically

Isn't the whole point of Reylo that an emotionally unstable bad boy who also does galactic genocide is nice to one woman (Rey) because of, like, some vague vibes or whatever from "the force" and he eventually turns nice for her but only after slaughtering tens of millions of people?

Also looking at a summary of that book...
>where rey's a phd student and falls in love with her coworker kylo who values her intelligence and helps her overcome her insecurities.
Isn't she a student and Kylo is a professor? So there's a problematic power dynamic thing going on there. Sure you do have the veneer of progressivism there (or fuck, more than just a veneer) where he values her intelligence, but it's still got the patriarchal bs where the woman can't just go for a guy who is on her level, like a fellow student who appreciates her intelligence? Also Kylo is described as a "reigning lab tyrant" with "six pack abs" lol, why can't the professor at least be a guy who doesn't fit into the narrow six pack abs beauty standard and who has a less authoritarian tyrannical teaching style and more of an authoritative/student centered/humanistic style?

Then their example of what women actually want:
>six pack abs
So a roided body.
>"reigning lab tyrant"
And a man who tries to out-alpha everybody 24/7.

I guarantee if you dug into their other examples, those traits would show up as well. The only thing lacking is the man disrespecting the woman, and that's because their examples always have the man disrespect everyone BUT the woman, who he instead dumps praise on 24/7 for simply being a woman with the most generic self-insert personality possible.
--- 73186764
>>73186514
>but they still love their wives 
This is still ultimately the same - for males, "love" for a female is a recognition of utility. The difference between a "hole" and a "wife" is predictability of long-term utility with minimal drawbacks. For example being with a "bitchy" female is too high of a price to pay for utility, whereas a "pleasant" female who serves utility is good results for very little investment.
Likewise a "traditional woman" is basically the best deal possible, you extract a very high amount of utility for very low input of effort/a low price.
>and would die for them.
This is not out of affection for the female herself, it is a male power fantasy. The idea of courageous sacrifice is peak masculinity. Be it for one's nation, family, a stranger, etc, it is ultimately an act of self-glorification that has very little to do with one's feelings towards the thing being heralded as the reason for the sacrifice.
--- 73186767

Hey to be fair tho, they had at least /half/ a point, the book he mentioned wasn't the worst of the worst "creepy adult abducts a female child and Stockholm syndromes her into loving him" or stuff more in that direction, there's something to the whole thing of him appreciating her intelligence, and she's a PhD student so it's, like, still pretty unethical but not quite the same as, like, some old professor creeping on his freshman sci 101 students and grooming her or whatever. As much as it pains my dumb ass to say it, the shitty Reylo fic turned into a book may be progress compared to other things

(But goddamnit it would be cool if women were actually genuinely deep into the feminist stuff many of them claim to like, and just really didn't like that toxic sort of stuff even when it's a bit more "mild" compared to worse alternatives)
--- 73186783
>>73186762
True, I just commented that maybe that book is progress compared to other worse examples, but even then, if the disrespecting is only dumping praise on the one woman, if anything that can just add to the grooming aspect too, the whole "not like the other girls" shit to separate her from her peers and all that

Fucking bleak

(Plenty of guys don't see women as just utilities and would be fine with the "bitcjy woman" who actually speaks up for herself and doesn't play the role of the "mommy wife" to provide utility - but then those guys tend to be unmasculine unattractive male feminists, and thus are seen as trash)

kylo doesn't slaughter tens of millions of ppl he just has mommy issues.
also i don't really like canon reylo because it just seems kind of unnatural that's why you'll see most of the fics written by women surrounding the relationship are spin-offs. buuuttt most of the original appeal (other than adam driver being hot) is that it involves rey, a powerful female protagonist who doesn't give in and take shit from men (do i have to spell out why this would be an appealing self-insert for a lot of women)

and he's not her professor lol, he's just a professor at her uni. the most "problematic power dynamic" is the slight age gap.
"authoritarian tyrannical teaching style" bro lmfaoo calm down he's just a grumpy teacher. it's not remotely that deep.
and why are you mad at women for liking six packs? bring up your woes with biology and evolution i guess idk.

Those men either 1) tolerate it, not like it or 2) extract utility from that in and of itself - they are weak men and seek more aggressive women to compensate. The women settling for them will often not expect much of them and take care of certain things traditionally reserved for men, like doing the household taxes/banking, will work more than the average woman so they don't have to, etc

I'll admit it's been a whole since I've seen the movies but didn't he literally shoot a giant space laser at the capital planet of the solar system in the first movie? Also he's, like, a space Nazi more broadly?

I get how Rey is an appealing self insert, and not the worst sort in terms of progress and such. The issue is more Kylo, he seems like a bad dude. Even if I'm wrong about the space laser blowing up the big planet what's it called, he was a space Nazi and seemed rather toxically masculine
>and he's not her professor lol
Oh ok, I didn't read it
>bro lmfaoo calm down he's just a grumpy teacher. it's not remotely that deep.
I mean I think we as a society could benefit from thinking more critically about that sort of thing. Part of making education more accessible and helping cultivate student success can be for teachers and professors to be nicer - retaining an /authoritative/ approach, sure, but not being the grumpy authoritarian sort that tends to be common in some fields
>why are you mad at women for liking six packs? bring up your woes with biology and evolution i guess idk.
Blaming biology and education seems pretty lazy. Women don't have to adhere to their physical beauty standards anymore and us men are capable of desiring them anyway, women can do the same with men

I'm one of those men, and I'd genuinely like it, plus I wouldn't want to be extracting utility from it, I'd still want to make sure I do my fair share

You guys remember when Leonardo Dicaprio abused Rose in Titanic? I can't believe women like that movie so much.

It's a two way street. Women murder tradition and so do men, it's impossible to get a tradwife if you're not willing to be a trad man. The big issue is when being a trad man won't bring you a tradwife and that seems to be the case these days. Adhering to tradition is seen as snobbery and something 99% of women aren't willing to do while many guys are and they're mocked for it (Unless they're extremely good looking).

Do any of you like Nonograms/other puzzles? I just did this one, look it turned out to be an elephant! I like elephants.
--- 73141839
Hmm, I wonder what this one will be? Can't see anything yet. Any guesses?
--- 73141846
I love them but haven't had the time to play them these last days.
--- 73141892
>>73141846
Finding the time for things you enjoy is important, anon! I hope you get around to them again soon.
--- 73142003
>>73141892
Still have no idea, but that's part of the fun!
--- 73142163
>>73142003
Ahh, nearly done now, pretty sure I see what it is? Do you, anons?
--- 73142257
>>73142163
It's a pineapple! That took me longer to finish than I thought it would, but that's ok. Some things need longer in the oven, isn't that right, anons?
I'm going to get a bit of exercise, have a shower, then maybe return. In case I don't come back, have a great weekend!
--- 73143035
>>73142257
Ahh, that's better. Time to start a new nonogram! I got quite a lot of the edges early on, which is super helpful.
--- 73143118
>>73143035
Hmm, is it flowers? Or maybe a ladybug? Not sure.
--- 73143230
>>73143118
Oh, I might know what it is now, and I'm pretty sure I was wrong! It's a whale? Or a fish? I think?
--- 73143429
>>73143230
Well, now that I've seen the finished thing, it's painfully obvious what it is, and perhaps painfully obvious why one browsing this board might have missed it. Opsie daisy!
--- 73144014
I appreciate the wholesomeness of this thread. You sound like you're having a lot of fun with these puzzles. I think that's very nice.
--- 73144281
I had never heard about these types of puzzles before. They look kinda fun, and that's a cute elephant.
--- 73144693
>>73144014
>>73144281
I do enjoy them, they're fun. You should both give them a go, there are plenty of websites for them. Smaller ones are sort of a test for how quick you can do them whereas bigger ones are more like a jigsaw puzzle, where you can take your time.

I'll do one more. Not a great start here, mostly been eliminating rather than filling in, but we'll see. No hints on what it is yet!
--- 73144826
>>73144693
Hmm, not going as well as I'd like, this is a bit of a toughie! Maybe it's a crane?
--- 73144919
>>73144826
Ahh, caught a break and I'm making more progress now. Any ideas? A chameleon? A monkey? That looks like a tail in the bottom left I think!
--- 73144970
>>73141784 (OP)
looks like a waste of my time if it isn't earning me money why the fuck am I doing it? if you are a NEET and get paid to sit on your ass carry on
--- 73145016
>>73144919
Well, if that isn't a neat pattern on row 12 (3-3-3) that I haven't seen before! Can you figure that out? But, more importantly, I'm pretty sure we know what it is now! I wasn't all too far off with chameleon, I suppose!
>>73144970
Sometimes we do things just for the heck of it, anon. The enjoyment we get from activities shouldn't be solely tied to its monetary value, should it?
--- 73145088
>>73145016
Wow, it was a cobra! Scary! That puzzle was quite hard to begin with, but once a couple of key parts slotted into place, it all fell in line. Isn't that just how it goes, anons?
--- 73145169
>>73141784 (OP)
Thank you for showing me the way of the nonogram, anon. I didn't even know these were a thing but they seem like fun and I'd love to try them out. What website or app do you recommend i start with?
--- 73145214
I was supposed to go to bed, but I'm not quite tired enough yet. Have a thread theme, to hopefully keep you all positive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrltGatijXc [Embed]
>>73145169
There are a myriad of websites where you can play them, probably apps on your phone and even Steam games. I would recommend starting and sticking with 5x5 and 10x10 at first, before moving onto 15x15. Start to notice patterns, and you're golden! The website I am currently using (that I found today, for this thread) is https://nonograms-katana.com/ I like their layout and options quite a bit.

This one had a nice start. Are those feet maybe? The bottom of a building? Not sure!
--- 73145325
>>73145214
Looks a bit like a gremlin or a furby? Don't think I'm right, but it sorta looks like that to me!
--- 73145358
I forgot how this works. Looks like Sudoku and I don't understand that as well. The outcome looks good.
--- 73145382
>>73141784 (OP)
>I like elephants
Cool OP, so does God.

>>73145214
>>73145325
Can you explain how the puzzle works? I don't get it.
--- 73145430
>>73145325
My progress has been very incremental, 1 square at a time. This is a tricky blighter, to be sure! No further guesses on what it could be, though.

>>73145358
>>73145385
I very much enjoy Sudoku as well, especially ones with special rules to make it a more interesting puzzle! I would love to explain it, but it's rather hard in text. Each square is either filled in, or a cross, and the filled in squares are represented by the numbers on the sides. So for example, if a puzzle were 1x6, the number might be 2-3. This would mean the first 2 squares are shaded, the 3rd is an X, and the final 3 are also shaded. It would be best to look up an explanation with pictures, though.
>>73145382
That's a very cool elephant, anon. I would love to see one in the wild some day!
--- 73145498
>>73145430
I just looked up the rules. It's kind of like the Battleship game as far as I understand.
--- 73145499
>>73145430
Still slowly making progress, I think it might be a drink? With an umbrella sticking out of it? Close to finding out for sure, though!
--- 73145512
>>73145214
That's a nice site. I'm already done with the first one I tried but I forgot to take a screenshot.
--- 73145525
>>73145499
I think it's a court jester.
--- 73145564
Wow, I understand how it works now and it's pretty fun. Thanks for showing this to me, Anon. Where can I find the cute ones which form images?
--- 73145626
>>73145564
Damn, I got Dunning Kruger'd. This is actually harder than I thought.
--- 73145642
>>73145626
I get that feeling, the first one was easy enough but this one is harder than I thought.
--- 73145866
>>73145499
Well, crikey, that was a tough one! Whomever made that puzzle made it a good challenge, well done to them!
>>73145525
Good guess! Now that I've seen it finished, I can absolutely see that. Funnily enough, I saw the J sort of forming in the middle and though oh, maybe it's a jester! But then I promptly discarded that thought for no good reason.
>>73145512
>>73145626
>>73145642
Congratulations on finishing your first one! The difficulty on them can change quite significantly, even if you are doing the same size, much the same way Sudoku can.
>>73145564
I honestly don't know that many websites for proper images, although I have seen some absolutely monstrously huge ones, we're talking like over 100x100 that form pretty much fully-fledged paintings! I might give one of those a go, some day.

I have to head off to bed now, anons, but I hope that I have ignited the passion for puzzles in your hearts! Keep at it, and remember that mistakes will happen, but you can persevere!
--- 73145883
>>73145866
Goodnight, Anon. I will continue doing these.
Here is a website for those who want to try. https://nonograms-katana.com/play/
--- 73146439
This is finally going somewhere. I think it's some kind of bird.
--- 73146522
It was a peacock. I hate peacocks now.

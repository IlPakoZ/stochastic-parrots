why do people take pride in their intelligence? smart people were purely lucky to be born smart and didn't do anything to deserve it

You say this until you realize 90% of people haven't read a book in the past 2 years. Most people don't use their brains at all.

theres nothing wrong with being born with a high iq, especially if you actually try to apply yourself intellectually. its dehumanizing those with low iqs that is morally bad

It is one thing to be smart and another thing to apply those smarts and another thing still to constantly learn new things and improve. If someone's tall and thin sure you'll be naturally good at running and track and field, but if you don't practice you won't be as good as you could be. It's the same way with intelligence and it's the reason why not everyone who's "interested in history" is a historian, that shit takes a lifetime to study properly with an accurate understanding and there's so much of it to go into. So.. it is one thing to have natural talent and it is another to apply it and make something of it, and judging by OP's phrasing, he has neither natural talent nor useful application of what little talent he has.

What be proud of being born with strong willpower and a good work ethic either? Being born with the ability to work hard isn't any different from being born intelligent.

OP is coping to make it seem like him being a dumbass isn't as bad as it is.

I read for hours at work. I read several news sites and scroll on here. Why do I get classified as "not using my brain at all" because I'm not reading some biography or bullshit fiction book?

Browsing kike media and calling strangers who disagree with your political views the n word on a mongolian basket weaving forum isn't going to give you a higher understanding of economics, how human beings function on a psychological basis, or how to make cyanide. Substance matters. Watching 3 hours of a documentary on why Egypt collapsed as a world power is different from watching 3 hours of blues clues.

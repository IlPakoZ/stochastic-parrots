I kinda like the constant horniness of nofap, but also hate it at the same time. You know?

The confidence you get from it is quite incredible. However, I'm not a fan of random bouts of arousal.

While we're on the topic, does anyone else have more pics like the one in the OP? I really like the colours, it gives me a nice urban neon 80s vibe or something.

If I got constantly horny during nofap then I wouldn't do it

How long and how much did you fap?
tfw used to fap 6x a day
Been nofapping a bunch of times, longest was 3 months, currently on day 4 this time around
You get small tastes of the effects and then waves of extreme horniness and each wave you defeat (by not fapping) levels you up until about a month and your energy levels have improved, mental acuity sharpened, and feel generally "better" and "clean" and can actually look people in the eye

Just for like a week

Most I did was almost a month, but it was pure pain. I was so horny I couldn't even sleep at night.

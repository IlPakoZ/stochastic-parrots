OPs image is lowkey trannyism. Crying yourelf to sleep because of an empty life is characteristically a male problem but by depicting the suffering individual as female it highlights just how irrelevant he is opposed to her: "oh wow that's so sad and relatable IF ONLY you were a women i would care"

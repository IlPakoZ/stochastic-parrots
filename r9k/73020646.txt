Could one woman significantly reduce the robot population, by travelling around the various countries and deflowering robots and acting like a GF to them for an agreed-to amount of time before moving on to the next robot? Or is this just unpaid prostitution which would do nothing to rehabilitate them?

She could, in theory, but what you're describing sounds like a way to be murdered and have your snuff film posted online

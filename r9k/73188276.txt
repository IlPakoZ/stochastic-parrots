But not enough......
If you've been watching US news you've noticed that not only is the Supreme court overturning liberal policies, but so are the lower courts and houses.
BUT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH
We have to get to a point where gays, lesbians, trannies are criminalized and women have no rights.
but the average normalfaggot will never do that.

How is this the end of a swing? Shits been going far-left for decades now and it's been swinging that way.
Now it's starting to swing the other way.

Not him, but the pendulum isn't really true.
>"Woaah crazy things are swinging right now!" when the country gets a literal CIA director like Bush who brings no paradigm shift to the table at all.
Or
> "wooaah literal Hitler, fascism!" for Trump who was better than Bush but still not a paradigm shift and offered no serious resistance to manufactured crisis.
There's no pendulum and the needle has been moving in one direction faster or slower since at least Wilson. 
The whitepill is that the empire is collapsing because it's ruled by mercenaries and unimpressive fogies, and even normies are starting to see it after covid lockdowns.

I still can't legally own an assault rifle made before 1986 without a special stamp, and it's fully illegal to any assault rifles after 1986. Pendulum isn't even close to swinging back because we don't even have our constitutional rights respected.

They obviously care a great deal, to the point of obsession with my hobby. Just look at all the laws relating to it.

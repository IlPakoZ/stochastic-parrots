Buses suck, they smell you can be robbed and they're unreliable

>robot friendly
That would mean an even bigger distance than cars, invasive collusion of personal space is totally offlimits.
How about private jets on NEETbux, maybe?

They only suck when you're riding a bus in a retard neighborhood. Ever ride a bus in a rich neighborhood? No crime. No smell. Great.

And the car lane tends to look more like the inside of the transitway in the animation, kek.

Shitty diet, no exercise, short-term pleasure is prioritized over long-term health and happiness.

Ironically, none of those fat cows would date me (the Asian might), even though I'm a 7/10 overall. Fit, tall, handsome, intelligent and wealthy. I just don't put up with bullshit.

Fast food, frozen foods, drinks loaded with sugar and alcohol. None of them probably cook fresh foods ever. They probably rarely eat fruits, or vegetables.
--- 73103815
>>73103804
I really wonder how much sugar they consume.
--- 73103837
>>73103815

Sugar is in EVERYTHING in the United States.

Like everyday? You will feel like shit then? How do they cope?
--- 73103867
>>73103841

Probably, they'll have health issues down the road like diabetes and shit. They cope by pretending being fat is hot and healthy.

I miss what women looked like in the 80's...

Can confirm am chubby and get Starbucks daily
I do eat a lot of fruit and vegetables though, I eat very healthy actually just drink tons of soda and coffee
--- 73103879
>>73103870
How much soda do you drink?
--- 73103884
alcohol. these thots drink white claws like water. if these hoes would cut out the soda and alcohol they would be stick thin.
--- 73103891
>>73103879
Around 2 cans of coke a day. I only sleep around 3 hours a day, so I need a lot of caffeine (and amphetamines) to keep going.
--- 73103912
>>73103879
>>73103891
Should add though, I do not consume alcohol in any capacity, if that helps distinguish.
--- 73103919
>>73103841
antidepressants. ssris and benzos, also alcohol. even the copes make you feel worse.
--- 73103950
>>73103870
Yep checks out, soda and star bucks are such an easy way to drink calories it's not even funny.
--- 73103962

What do you think these girls order?
--- 73103986
>>73103962

a sandwhich they take one bite of and 2 albsolutely sugary disgusting drinks that combine to 800 calories.
--- 73103996
>>73103962
I don't get star bucks so I don't know the drinks. But I'd assume something with flavoring syrup, some cream/whipped cream
--- 73104019
>>73103950
Yeah my diet is super fucked up, I did some calculations and it turns out I only eat around 800-1000 calories a day. The rest is all drinking coffee and soda, hence being slightly overweight. I'm at like a 26 BMI I think, so only one point overweight but still overweight nonetheless.
>>73103962
>What do you think these girls order?
I get the medium size caramel macchiato in the morning, on rare occasions one of those fruit refresher things. That gives me my morning caffeine + amphetamines 
Then around 4 pm I start to feel like death itself so I take a 30 minute "nap" (you can't actually fall asleep while amphetamines are in effect), drink a coke around 7, then around midnight I get tired again and drink another coke, sometimes more. Rinse and repeat
--- 73104053
>>73104019
>amphetamines

well that just explained all of your problems. its no wonder you feel like shit youre one chemical off of meth. youre never going to come off of it and i guarentee you were prescribed as a kid. have fun being bound to the medical jew through stims, benzos and ssris.
--- 73104071
>>73103691 (OP)
All the ones online are that I've spoken to. They have that ready to flub look.
--- 73104093
>>73104053
I was prescribed it at 17 so technically not a kid. I initially used it for grades
That being said I would never do SSRIs or anything brain-destroying like that. Amphetamines don't change who you are as a person like SSRIs and benzos do, they're more like a mega enhanced shot of caffeine that makes you productive and alert (and sleepless)
>youre never going to come off of it
I don't want to, it's literally life changing in a good way. I have done so much I never would have been able to do without it
--- 73104118
>>73104093
I never understood the SSRIs change who you are. I'm literally on sertraline and all they do is balance my mood out

Damn dude youre very misinformed. Read up about what youre taking.

I'm just basing that on observation of a friend who started them. You probably don't realize how much it has changed you to those around you

Yes, it was good and I'm glad.
--- 73104302
>>73104258
Fair enough. I just wonder how much is a person "changing" and how much is the medication actually working. Like I said it balances my mood and I feel pretty mellow. But my core as a person hasn't really changed to my knowledge. I don't think my friends have noticed major changes either

like 95% of the foods americans have to eat is processed, and like 99% of parents feed their children processed foods.
--- 73105448
Corn syrup in literally everything. Outrageous portion sizes at every restaurant condition us Americans to eat far more in a single serving than any average person should. Also once we turn 18 most people stop participating in the various systems that force us to exercise.

I had a bad day. Everything is going to shit. People I know are having a bad time too.
How to cope... 
Also tell me what (You)r problems are

I would like to do the last of my drugs right now. However, I cannot buy more until Friday. Pretty shit problem I guess. At least I don't care about anything else.

Glad to see I'm not the only one, what happened anon?
For me it is rather small but still makes me sad but motivated to make some changes

Fuck, if I could ever afford a life of drugs I would no doubt be in your situation. Hope you get clean and successful or die in an overdose after feeling pure bliss.

I lost my wagie job as a bartender (the same day I was gonna quit), my mother doesn't want me going back to town, my brother whom I live with showed his true colors and didn't tell me he was about to move and lastly I'm broke.
I still got my friends but their each having a hard time of their own.

recovering from a breakup, tons of crying no eating...etc
Oh and uni deadlines piling up

It's good you go to uni. People don't give you that much shit about what you're doing with your life.
Sorry about your breakup but trust me when I say you WILL get over it. Don't go back to her side if she texts you or something. It will bring you no good. I know both from firsthand and other people's experiences

For me it's insomnia hitting me hard for the past few days, also I finally dated a girl a few times after more than a year of being single but I feel like she's not interested anymore despite me being very interested so back to square one

It's a he, we broke up because of LDR, I keep telling myself I will never fall for it again, but I always do. That was my last one though, I really miss him, I had plans of moving in with him and start again. All of that went to shit now

I'm Latino and late 20s, my temples were thinking and topical fin and min had worked at stalling but I just decided to get a hair transplant

About 1700 grafts, I'm now at what I would consider Norwood 1 ish

I just gotta let the months pass for the implants to grow out

I stopped fin and now am using topical dutasteride and minoxidil still

I'm not going bald but I am scared of it. What can I do to help prevent it before it comes?

There are ways to guaranteed prevent it, but you might not like them.

Gave up a year ago. I was already ugly so it's not like it mattered. I'm considering getting SMP (hairline tattoo) but half of them look like shit/obviously fake. Lots of pics of 40 year old white guys that somehow have the hairline of a 19 year old Dominican

Half of them look terrible, but the other half look pretty decent if the hairline is made to look natural. Like a norwood 2 buzzcut

You wish you cut off your balls for your hairline?
Thats retarded.

yes and started rubbing estrogen on my head. then again at that point it might just be better to get a wig. i will never spread my balding genes though would rather have no nuts than no hair. 

sexuality is a burden anyways. the downfall of man.

Hair is serious business.
Hairloss forums are filled with guys dosing themselves with female hormones because fin didn't work and they can't accept living with baldness.

not doxxing myself but feel free to lemme know how i should do that my brother
>>73048696
westoids are usually the people most eager to tell you japan is "actually worse than you think". don't get me wrong though, japan is a lot better than the states no question
>>73048718
based. careful though, lotta those houses need a lot of work since they're old as hell

i know but i'm mostly getting it for the land, i'll try to get around 4-7 houses like that in the same area so i can make a proper farm or if i can find one that is already a farm that works too and then i'll demolish those and build something more modern inside but with that old japanese building style

isn't true though a lot of restaurants and other places only allow japanese people? and also racial discrimination against non japanese people is normal?

Thats only certain establishments. Like for instance those geisha and maiko houses. Only Japanese people are generally allowed in and you have to be invited by someone who is already a member of the club.

Burgers on 4chan who have never left their basement love to talk shit about Asian and European countries to make themselves feel better about what an absolute hellscape the US is. I have been to Europe and Japan a number of times and it was fantastic.

I don't browse this board but have you made any friends there yet? I live around Saitama and would be fun to say hi and maybe eat out.

This applies when moving to any country, really but you preferably want to already HAVE money before you move.

You will never be Japanese. They will never accept you truly.

Were you listening to people on here about Japan? You should always do the opposite of what 4chan says. This site is full of miserable people that feed off of each other's anger and all have themselves convinced the world is ending soon

How did you learn japanese brobot? I've been reading web novels for a year now, I've watched over 200 hours of youtube let's plays by japanese, i've used and dropped anki many times during the years, be it with premade decks or with my own mining deck.

And I can't say I'm even n1. Probably n3.
I can't produce any ideas without second guessing. When I read one of those "which one of these jap sentences are correct" I sometimes get it right, most often than not I don't.

i don't want to be japanese. i'm happy to be an american dude living in japan. never understood people's obsession with wanting to be "one of them" or whatever. you got buddies that accept ya then you'll be fine

gotta keep grinding brother, anki being an every day thing is key. can't recommend terrace house on netflix enough, very very good for casual conversation practice

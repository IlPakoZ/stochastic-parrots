Was in town today overheard a conversation. Didnt get much of it but it went likethis

>Im not being racist but...
>thats absolute niggler
>youll be shovelling shite all day
>itll be a horrible job

not really sure of the context. was that a joke? was he being coy in his racism? was he referring to a foreign boss? who knows.

I don't think I did. She was probably meaning to stop for a while to focus on her studies. It was all starting to feel stressful for her feeling the need to do something for free. She could do it still whenever she wants because 99% of people are supportive. She wouldn't just stop for a few bad apples.

I dunno lad, you hang out here
--- 73070771
>>73070753
It is if it bothers her. Its the implication that you know this too. Which you do. I think you'd get arrested if anyone bothered to explain the situation in depth. theyd at the minimum get in contact with ruth and ask her thoughts on the matter. if it turns out it is effecting her in a significant way is a straight forward process thereafter.

Where are you looking? If it's online, fill in whatever form it is.
--- 73070814
>>73070669
I do care. It's her choice. Only a few girls continue to make asmr for more than few years. A lot of them get bored and find new interests. She'll be taken advantage of her adult life now so will be going out more with friends and on holidays.

That could only happen if I broke the law, which I didn't. Even then it would be a difficult process to prove. She would not want all that hassle because I'd be claiming I'm innocent (which I am).

Imagine if there's a mad gunman going around shooting people and several people are hiding somewhere in a building. He's already been around town shooting up multiple places. The government issues their emergency alert protocol to all phones within that area. Now everyone who is trapped will have their phones set off with a loud siren. He then finds them and unloads several rounds into them.

Great work government protecting your citizens. Shall be keeping it off personally. It will do more harm than good. It will be used for silly weather alerts.

Isn't it great lads. It Monday. Another 5 days of pretending to care about colleagues' lives, corporate values, customer needs, performance targets, risk management, skills training, personal development, team cohesion, your network, your personal brand, team meetings, 'quick catch ups', your manager needing a favour, overtime opportunities.

Fuck it all.

Yea it's shit but the alternative is to have nothing to live because you have no money other than to keep yourself alive, no social interactions, no skills, no self-worth, every day is the same with nothing to look forward to, turning to alcohol, turning to drugs, turning to crime, jail, less money, less friends, even family abandons you, self-hatred, no escape from the vicious cycle.

Stay in work. Don't be me.

Very nice.
I fear that I may need to add, the spell of originality, so I choose to cast it as a shit joke

Is it weird that I prefer watching my gf masturbate over actually shagging her? I find her attractive and sexy but prefer to enjoy her passively. Anyone else like this?

>which that decidedly is not
Weird how there was 6 seeds, of which 3 germinated and looked the same, but that's weeds for you, I guess.

It was a joke, I didn't expect you to take it seriously.

Absolutely amazing how many people stop to give chuggers in London the time of day to let them waffle off their shite

You seem touchy friend. Don't come crying to me when you have to try to eat leaves. But don't take my word for it, I don't really mind, but you won't be allowed to join our secret r9k gardening club with that attitude.

I'm a gardencel, I couldn't join the club.

first time hearing that. where does the term even come from?
--- 73077225
>>73077179
True, mostly women. I usually just walk fast with headphones and I look like someone who is skint anyway so they don't bother with me
>>73077216
I don't even really know, I always thought it was odd myself
--- 73077231

Just had a look and it's a mix of charity and mugger. Obvious in hindsight ha

I forgot to say sorry. I'm clueless, so will germinate a couple more seeds and see what happens. I'll keep that 1, then when it turns out to be what you've said, I'll post it.

>and instead of helping out a single person
shit tier lowest common denominator thinking. Why should anyone be reasonably well off when there's always a poorer person to give that wealth too?

It's not like he just blows all his money on personal luxurious, quite the opposite. All his money goes to the greater good of humanity.

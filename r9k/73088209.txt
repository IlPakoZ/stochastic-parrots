Mentally Disabled "people" should be aborted or euthanized after they are born 
I'm tired of seeing these people around. We have the technology and understanding to effectively make it so I never have to see another downy ever again

They're not even human bruh. They don't have souls or a spirit. They're in-between man and animal

I don't think they should be euthanized, sterilizing them is more humane and will have the same end effect.

I stopped caring what people who are probably less intelligent than me think a long time ago. Your arrogance is rooted in having characterized normativity by the average in mass society.

You are, by definition, mediocre and will be like this for the rest of your life

it should at least be legalized for parents who don't want to take care of a genetic deformity for the rest of their lives

Euthanizing them is humane if you do it the modern medical way. It's not death row bruh
They put people to a peaceful permanent sleep in Canada and places in Europe

if you have a screaming autistic child then your life is basically ruined. you have to wipe this guys ass until you're dead basically. if you have another kid to offset your mistake, that kids life is ruined too.

Oh no it must be so hard for you, seeing a mentally disabled person once every few months from a distance. However can you cope with such stuggles? Murder is totally justified in this situation you're right, no one should have to go through something as traumatic as that.

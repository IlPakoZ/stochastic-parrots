Write your phone number and pray it isn't a man that calls you.

I was going to, but I leave this pos job on the 26th and I don't want to change my number anytime soon. I couldn't get rid of it after, it'd just be there for like a year probably before anyone bothered to get rid.

I thought about getting a cheapo pay as you go sim and writing that but my phone doesn't have dual SIM. Figure a throwaway email or a kik or some shit is the safest and easiest way for me, but more hassle for the other side.

Also still not sure I should. It might not even be the same person who wrote the first message. And there's a whole lot of 49 year old romanian babushkas at my job I could end up face to face with

I like, HAVE to shave it atleast once every two months because otherwise the length drives me NUTS. Sure bf gets sad because no more bush but atleast the one one time I do shave I make sure it's perfect smooth so that its still another type of special treat

I dont mind a bush but im not a fan of the whole damn jungle. Such thing as too much of a good thing you know?

it's only visually sexy, having to deal with a bush makes it harder to please her because of all the hair that gets in the way, might even make it impossible to please her depending on what you do and how hairy she is and her anatomy

fat people in general are not pleasing to be around. they were not born that way, it's not a condition, you're just a fat fuck.

Women who shave or trim are just selfish and lazy. It's ugly. Women should have pubic hair.

> Women should have pubic hair.
Female pubic hair is a secondary sexual characteristic and of a pattern unique to them. It's part of a woman's innate physiological beauty

Are you gay?

>>73057845
No, tranny, that's not how any of this works. Shaving is a pain in the ass and once it grows past the itchy stage a real woman never wants to go back. Shaving is a treat for burnt out coomers, faggots, and pedos.

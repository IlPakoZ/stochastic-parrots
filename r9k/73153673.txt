Weird how?

You tell people about what makes you weird, but say it like you're telling a joke. People eat it right up.

I can't imagine a woman being anything other than horrified that someone browses 4chan and watches rekt or something of that nature, regardless of if you say it like a joke.

I feel this. All of my coworkers think im a weird sperg. Im not autistic but I am severely anxious around people and an dumbass and people talk down to me and tease me because of it. Idk if there is a way to cope though. Being weird is a death sentence.

Observe yourself as an outsider. You will become even weirder.

Me too, Anon.
2 of my colleagues have called me weird to my face, everyone else considers me to be odd and the bosses think I'm intelligent in the way spergs are really good at one particular topic, even though I don't have autism or aspergers. Or at least I don't think I do. It would certainly explain a lot.

Unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. So who cares about what happens here on Earth anyway and what is considered weird or not?

Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:

https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]

It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 

>"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."

Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.

Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:

>"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."

Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.

Oh, women. I thought you meant in general.
Yeah, with them, I try to repress my weirdness as much as possible. Unfortunately, that leads to me appearing boring because I don't have much else going on.

I'm not OP and I was just using women as an example.
I try my best to hide my awkwardness and appear normal, but that just makes me come across as even more awkward/weird.
If I mention some of my accomplishments, I get the feeling that I'm "humble bragging" but how the hell are you supposed to impress people with positive aspects of your life without coming across as bragging?

That's a really good question. I rarely try to state my positives because of this because it always feels like I'm bragging. Even writing that previous sentence felt kinda pretentious, like I'm flexing how humble I am.

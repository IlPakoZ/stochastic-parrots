Anyone else here an androphobic male? Not an oxymoron, what I mean is straight guys who have few/no male friends and don't like to interact with other men in general, preferring to be by themselves or around women.

I think I ended up this way because I really don't like being around the smell of other men, it's like the same mechanism that makes me very attracted to the way women smell makes me disgusted by male scent, like a phenomenal thing. Aside from that, I don't have any normal (or abnormal) male interests, and just having to talk to other men makes me feel tense and on edge, like I can't relax and let my guard down the way I can when talking to women. This is literally the opposite of what I hear other guys experiencing: "Just talk to women like you do with men." Talking to women is easy and effortless, like if I actually have something to say, not trying to flirt, but for me talking to men is very uncomfortable unless we already know each other or have some kind of professional relationship. Otherwise it's a very coarse exchange where I'm making sure I'm not letting another man "mog" me in some subtle display of dominance, not showing much emotion and avoiding any kind of submissive language or behavior- but at the same time, not display too much coldness and aggression in my demeanor... if interacting with women is like walking on eggshells, then interacting with men feels like walking through a minefield.

I don't have any male friends and don't really want any. I also don't have any female friends and do not want any.

I put up with men hoping I'll eventually meet one who knows a woman I can date.

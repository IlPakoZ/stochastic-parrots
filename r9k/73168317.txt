Cannot sleep but I'm too afraid of going to discord and see her offline for another day. It's starting to hurt me bad.

Try not to think about that too much! It's best to move on. You should even unadd her. Women actually will feel remorse if one day they log back in and see you gone. But if they log back and see you still hung up to the idea to this day, they'll think you're pathetic.

I know that feeling, anon, and I have to admit I don't really have any advice for it other than what >>73168716 said. How close were you two before she went silent?

I really do hate women god damn. This is mostly accurate but let's be clear they don't feel remorse, they feel starved of validation because they see you don't care about them. It makes them look at their insecurities but looking is not analyzing.

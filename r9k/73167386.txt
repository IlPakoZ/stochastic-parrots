no idea desu.
the only bf i've ever had was obsessed with me and treated me like a princess but i realized i'd never be able to live with him bc he acted too much like a man.
like i don't mean he was super masculine or anything, he just did normal guy stuff and said certain things that made me realize he had such a moid pov about the world and i just knew it would be torturous to live with.
i'm not a lesbo tho i think i just have a lot of deep-rooted misandry.

Ive never dated but I completely understand the deep rooted misandry thing. It honestly ruined a lot of things in my life, including the relationship with my male family members, socializing and my mental health. I cant even see real men as attractive anymore, no matter how handsome and/or cool they are. 

Anyways, at this point I just need 2D. I cant want to be plugged to the computer for eternity and lead a happy life or actually a thousand different lives not to get bored. I want to custom my looks to perfection each time and then go for certain anime men I already find perfect as they are. Thats the only dating plan I have for myself. 
Just sucks that I dont know if I wont kill myself before technology gets there.

I'm happy for you, and I hope you manage to escape permanently soon.

Fearless is my favorite album because it's the furthest she matured as an artist in pop country, which is where I wish she could have stayed, or at least produced more. I might have become an actual "fan" if she had continued progressing in that direction. Second place is Red, the furthest she matured as an artist in pop rock. Pop rock's not quite my thing, but I respect it as an accomplishment for what she was trying to do. Behind that I value her self-titled album, which wasn't perfect, but was a strong debut with an immediate identity of its own. You say that Speak Now was her best, but I say that it was only her fourth best, as it was only transitional, in between genres, without really much of its own identity. You can hate me for this if you want. I will take your hatred and live with it.

Off the top of my head, I remember liking
>Should Have Said No
>Jump Then Fall
>Fifteen
>Hey Stephen
>The Best Day
>Mean
>Superman
>State of Grace
>I Bet You Think About Me
but then for Pop Taylor, the only songs I really remember liking are
>Anti-Hero
>You're On Your Own, Kid
and everything else is just a blur. Pop just ain't my thing. Taylor Swift just ain't my thing... but in another timeline, with a different direction for her career, she could have been my thing.

And she ain't cowboy.

--- 73168054
>>73167922
I mean depends. I said a thousand lives. Some of my favorite anime men will be abusive af. But switching to a different life for some aftercare will balance it out. I dont mind being abused by characters I like, its a hot fantasy. I just know they are characters and not real people. Real abusive men are repulsive and no fun. Thats why real dating is not for me. I dont think I could ever form a real relationship where you need to trust the other party and lose a good chunk of control you have over the situation. 

Also why are you being mean for no reason?

Ohhhh, we have talked!!!!! Thats sooo awesome, I actually smiled so hard realizing that. You are awesome, serendipity is awesome :D 

Awww and dont worry! I only come here very rarely anyways. I mean im pretty opposite from like 99% of users here anyways, I initially came here on the assumption everyone here would be super smart and interesting. And while there are some people who are very smart and nice, I think the majority should deefinitely lessen the porn addiction. 

Ah yes i remember you saying all of that. And gosh Id never get mad over something as silly as that haha! Its perfectly a okay :) I definitely do love all of those albums but I just enjoy speak now the most. Better than revenge, innocent, last kiss, dear John, all absolute favorites within her discography. Especially for better than revenge, I love that punk rock inspired early 2000s vibe she had. If she ever released a rock album i feel like id ascend to the sky. Based on midnights aesthetic I was reaaaally hoping for a 70s rock fleetwood Mack esque album buuut im happy with what I got. Wouldve couldve shouldve is one of my favorite Taylor songs. It tears my heart out :( 

Honestly I love pop Taylor but I like every genre of music, just a preference to rock and metal. New Romantics has made me so much happier and unchained, and like Taylor said in the song, the best people in life are free :) 

Im curious, what kind of music do you like? :0

>I think the majority should deefinitely lessen the porn addiction.
I think this website needs a blue SFW /r9k/, or even a blue SFW /soc/. I just want someplace to talk to people about life and love and loneliness without having pornography shoved in my face all over the catalog. It'll never happen though. And that's why leaving is a good thing.

Here's a couple 3x3s for my tastes. For country specifically, I grew up with what I thought was country, but looking back it was just country rock. When it comes to modern country I have an affinity more for the "progressive bluegrass"-y side. My country mainstays are Alison Krauss, Crooked Still, the Dixie Chicks, Johnny Cash, Nickel Creek, and Railroad Earth. But my actual favorite music is 1960s folk rock. Bob Dylan, Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and then Paul Simon's solo career up through the modern era. What type of rock do you listen to usually?

The hard part of leaving /r9k/ (or 4chan, if I manage to make it that far) is figuring out what to do with your time. I know I should be working harder on my book backlog and my movie backlog. What should you be doing instead of being here?

Its perfectly normal to feel that way. I like the way some moids look, but I dont like male energy.

We need separate gender spaces right now. Or allow men and women to fight and kill each other. If you hate males so much, dont be in male spaces

i hate men too, because im not a stacy they treat me like shit on their shoe. i wish a virus would kill everyone with the Y chromosome. 

failing that, i wish everything was segregated by gender and moids and trannies werent allowed in any womens spaces. if you are a woman all moids do is judge you on whether you are fuckable or not, and if you arent fuckable they treat you like garbage. and they think all women and girls are just there to rape. im sick of having to share sidewalks, cafes, transport, public spaces with them. there should be a moid apartheid.

I can fall in love with almost anyone as long as I think they have soul because I am overtly romantic and out of touch with reality, but for someone to marry and start a family it would be same race, religion, and looksmatch so 4/10 maybe. I don't really know my rating, I'm below average looks but not ugly enough for anyone to notice me.

the irony of this statement when moids and moid failmales (trannies) are constantly invading womens spaces to rape and harass them. kill yourself scrote.

Since I was a little kid and watched this one episode of Fairly OddParents where they separated womens and mens worlds, Ive never wanted anything more. I truly want to never see any men ever again.

men should be seen and not heard and only attractive ones should be allowed to exist for the female gaze in controlled enclosures like animals in a zoo

Woaaaah, honestly I havent listened to a lot of these. Which is so awesome because id love to gain new music, so thank you :) im really happy, this is why I love talking to people about music. I just learn so much. What do you think are some good beginner songs to get into that genre? Could ya recommend me some, Ive really wanted to branch out buutt, it is a little intimidating. 

Ohh, and you must be young right? I was born after those newer albums were released so youre older than me buuut thats cool! Howd you get introduced to music and your favorites? Im always so curious:) 

For me my favorite songs right now are:

Whoopsie Daisy haha I forgot to include this but yeah absolutely this place would be greatly improved by that. I do plan on quitting permanently eventually buuut its interesting to see social media if it didnt have the draconian restrictions of other places. 

Oh thats awesome thats awesome. What kind of books and movies do you have backed up? I know I certainly have a ton haha! And for things I should be doing, hmmm. I definitely love to sew a lot (someone miiight recognize me from this) I really like cooking, gardening, getting gifts for people I love, music is obviously a given haha, singing too! I also just love 1950s related stuff and vintage aesthetics.

I will listen to all of these, and I will tell you what I think of them... never. Because I'm leaving /r9k/ and you're leaving /r9k/. And That's A Good Thing. But I did just listen to your Flamingos now and they were still great.

I think you're missing out if you don't listen to albums. Many of your favorite singles take on new meanings if you listen in their proper context.

>Could ya recommend me some, Ive really wanted to branch out buutt, it is a little intimidating. 
I'm starting with Fleetwood Mac because you like Fleetwood Mac. Here's the Dixie Chicks singing Fleetwood Mac.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxTl3UgYbhg [Embed]
When you listen to it on the album, it's sandwiched between these two songs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c5b8ZtjwwY [Embed]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKx3coz3G7c [Embed]
You would miss out on these if you didn't listen to albums.

You've listened to Bob Dylan before, I assume, but here's a couple songs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHG06Q45ziI [Embed]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb4PsXncNV8 [Embed]
so that you can hear these same songs covered by Nickel Creek
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93E8vCg5RA0 [Embed]
and covered by Crooked Still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C4g8sMVbIM [Embed]

Simon &amp; Garfunkel also sang Bob Dylan before their big hit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fWyzwo1xg0 [Embed]
and then they made a song for a movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C1BCAgu2I8 [Embed]
but then they fought too much and broke up in 1970, the same year as the Beatles, after one last album
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3LFML_pxlY [Embed]
while reuniting occasionally over the years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Ro3eGuznI [Embed]
but mainly Art Garfunkel faded into obscurity while Paul Simon continued to shine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP6a-7MP91g [Embed]

But back to albums. If you haven't listened to this already, it is your DUTY as a 4channer to listen to this #1 /mu/ meme at least once from start to finish.

>Howd you get introduced to music and your favorites?
I got into country as a little kid when my nanny would play the local country music radio station. They just played whatever was popular at the time, not the classics. I'm still ignorant about the classics.

So I never got to hear stuff like this on the radio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeZRYhLDLeU [Embed]
when I was listening to stuff like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHCfZTRGiI [Embed]

I got into folk rock in high school when I started listening to my parents' music collection, so here's a song about parents and children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkaKwXddT_I [Embed]

How did you get into metal? I'm not opposed to metal, but it's completely foreign to me. I like chill and relaxing music, so I never got into anything harsh and loud.

>>73168942
>What kind of books and movies do you have backed up?
I want to try out the detective/mystery/crime genre, so I have a few Agatha Christie books and a Nero Wolfe title on my list for 2023. I also want to read more autobiographical memoirs to broaden my horizons, because I mostly read fiction and not much non-fiction. For movies I like foreign film and really old movies. 1970s, 1960s, 19540s, 1940s, 1930s... that's the stuff for me.

You know what? We've actually spoken previously. We were talking about your interest in the 1950s, and I mentioned some 1950s movies I had seen recently, and you thought I was recommending them, and you left the thread before I could tell you that I wasn't recommending them, and before I could tell you what my actual favorites were. How dare you?

>>73169434
I think I just smiled an ever bigger smile than before, whaaaat! I know you from so much!!! Thats soooo cooooo!!!! Oh my god I am so happy somehow we always see each other :D maybe were just destined to talk to one another hahaha! Whats the probability of this happening so much oh my gosh. Im sorry im just stupidly happy this is awesome. 

Awwww I see thats a very sweet story :)
I liked some folk but veerry contemporary haha, I too know nothing about the classics! 
Awww I really liked it thank you :)

I went through a period of pretty heavy depression and emptiness when quarantine happened. I couldnt really feel anything for a while, and everything became grey sludge. I found metal, more so nu-metal, specifically my freshman year. I had only listened to dreamscape music, alternative pop, pop, and a little bit of indie at that point so it was startling. I didnt really enjoy it at first. But as I got better and became much happier, I fell really in love with deftones and nu-metal. 

The big thing for me is the exhilaration, the emotion, the thrill, the adrenaline, the passion I feel from metal and rock. It makes me feel alive, it helped me awake from that catatonic coma esque state I had been in during quarantine. I just love music that excites me. I have absolutely no interested in vices like drinking, or drugs, or promiscuity. I guess you could consider me more on the traditional side haha. Buuut I find my feelings of freedom through music.
I also lile metal because 1) I feel like an eldritch god HAHA 2) and because i grew up so sheltered and helpless it makes me feel so powerful. 
monster by skillet and heart shaped box by nirvana were rock songs I listened to as a child so you could say I technically diiid always have in interest in it. 

Im so sorryyyy :( these threads always close so early! I mean to respond but by the time I wake up theyre gone :( 
Im sorry, and you can absolutely give me you real recommendations. Id love to see them :)

I'm glad we could have one more meeting before you leave /r9k/ and before I leave /r9k/. I hope you understand why I won't be able to talk with you in private. You guessed right that I'm older. Too old for /r9k/. So this conversation is as far as it goes. But it's nice to run into interesting people by random chance, because it gives you hope for the future that random chance might strike again.

Just three movie recommendations this time, restricting myself only to movies that I've seen in 2023:
>Marty (1955) - The best 1950s film I've seen in 2023, and any other film I can recommend wouldn't be from the 1950s, so what's the point?
>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) - A movie that's colorful and musical and aesthetic, so I think you're going to love it... but it's in French.
>West Side Story (1961) - A movie that's colorful and musical and aesthetic, so I think you're going to love it... but I wish the ending had been more Shakespearean.

I'm glad metal was able to comfort you when life was rotten. I hope metal continues to be enjoyable as your life continues to improve, and I hope things only go up from here. It was good seeing you again, now take care and be well.

No.
--- 73082772

I can answer that: they've only met up once and didn't have sex during that time. So the answer is no, N/A, and thus far never.
--- 73082794
>>73082544
>>73082569
Distance was too much. I dated each of them for over 2 years. And yes we visited and spent time in person together.
As for finding one just talk to people in threads. Engage with them. Have a real conversation and none of that meme and buzzword fueled nonsense you see on average. Just treat them like people. Even if it's a coomer thread you can still act like a decent guy. But if you end up dating someone then make sure you are on the same page about things. Make a plan for moving and being together. Don't waste time and communicate like a madman. Good luck lads.
If there are any nerdy submissive kinky girls from Europe in this thread let me know.

Oh well...
There's gotta be someone else out there.
--- 73082912
>>73082843
There are plenty. Quite a few from Poland and eastern Europe for whatever reason. But the best sre the ones that just lurk most of the time. Then you post something that piques their interest and you star talking. It's quite nice when it happens.
--- 73083000
>>73082680
>How did you meet them and why do they try to help you?
by posting my tag and because i say that i haven't had friends or hobbies besides video games ever
--- 73083040
>>73082912
how many did you talk to? 
well they wouldn't be from west europe, that would just be silly and weird. no girl in west EU is lonely or weird, it's normies everywhere.
--- 73083060
>>73082758
Because mtfs have unreachable standards for me

>>73083040
Oh there have been girls from the Netherlands and some femanon from France that wanted to get ambushed and raped. I talked to a handful I'd say? But I've also been here since it's inception so over the years it isn't all that many.
--- 73083138
I am not a right-wing trannie-obsessed /pol/itical sperg, but I do have to wonder how the fuck did trans shit become so widespread so quickly.

Even (perhaps ESPECIALLY) here on 4chan, in all the dark and moldy corners where the Nazi retard brigade doesn't patrol very often, you see this shit all the time now. Trannies, trannie-chasers, trannie speak and Tumblr-tier mannerisms. It's so offputing.

It's very sad, in a way. A nerdy community can't be a nerdy community anymore. It must either be a "redpilled" hive of would-be school shooters, or the HRT equivalent of a opium den.
--- 73083163
>>73083131
>Oh there have been girls from the Netherlands
literally where and when. i've never seen any from here. I know two in 6 years on this site. one who wanted to fuck her brother and one mega autist bitch.
god I wish I could meet up with a fun nice fembot from the netherlands, but it'll never happen
--- 73083205
>>73083163
Got to lurk more I guess. There have been a few from Germany too but I never got to talk any of them outside of threads. 4chan women are my kryptonite as sad as that sounds. I tried dating apps but women on there are just bland as fuck.
--- 73083224
Good for you OP. I'm glad you gave another human being a chance and ended up with someone lovable who loves you back. thank you for doing that, it has a positive impact on the world, not even just you and her.
--- 73083228
>>73083000
Do they like you after seeing your face?
>>73083060
How many have you tried talking to? Are you an incel?
>>73083138
>It must either be a "redpilled" hive of would-be school shooters, or the HRT equivalent of a opium den
Not really. I think if /pol/tards didn't demonize trans girls then they wouldn't be focused on creating circlejerk communities or whatever like r/traa that are cancerous. You can have a community where there are some trans girls in it who feel fine without the whole place being gay/trans-themed or whatever.
--- 73083237
>>73083228
yes, in fact the only time they do is when they see my face. but my personality just fails to be anything besides pathetic to them

Cast a wider net and go for lower-tier girls.

eh, I've been out as trans and watching this shit for nearly two decades now, and there have always been out trans people (and nonbinary people, though that hasn't always been the term), and we've always been very online because we are isolated (by stigma and by simple statistics). 

the community just kind of solidified over the years and it became easier for people to find out what they were and what they wanted to do about it. there was more info recorded, more people there, etc. we also got more media exposure through celebrities (Laverne Cox, for example), and the terrible way in which we were treated got considerably less terrible. medical guidelines for transition got less awful as research expanded and more doctors learned about it as a specialty, all of these things reinforced each other, etc.

Then conservatives and some second-wave "feminists" picked this up as a wedge issue after they lost at gay marriage and shit got to the point where even people who'd never met a trans person IRL were convinced they knew about all it and it was a pressing issue for the whole US populace. it's easier to agree with that online bc we still have a very vocal and outsized presence online compared to how many of us there actually are.

(1/2)
--- 73083393
one of my coworkers is a trans but i don't think she knows what 4chan is she seems a little retarded in a cute way...
--- 73083394
TL;DR people were less awful to us IRL and the trans internet got better, but plenty of people were coming out as trans or nonbinary before, we just had to do it older and with more severe PTSD. 

(2/2).
--- 73083398
>>73083365
She looks nothing like that. She's cute and smol and my lovey.

NL Is a nice country. Chances are just really low to meet anyone from there on here. Even Germany with its 80+ million has barely any femanons. Poland seriously has the biggest number on here from what I have seen.
--- 73083427

She's a cute girl, dough.
>>73083409
Do you like her?

it's complete normieville, nothing nice about it for people like me.
I'd rather live in an east euro country like poland where there's lots more mentally ill girls with way lower standards and expectations
--- 73083467
>>73083433
You still wouldn't meet them anon. Don't kid yourself. At least one side of the relationship needs to have their shit together. Also mentally ill girls make bad partners. Trust me on that. You need that unicorn with daddy issues that still kept herself sane and hides her perversions behind a mask. But good luck finding that. My last gf was pretty close to that but she was also on the other end of the world.
--- 73083491
>>73082180 (OP)
Fuck off normalfaggot. Fembots don't exist thus there's no such thing as a true r9k gf, tranny or not.

We're two true robots and we inspire fauxbots everywhere!
--- 73083506

>You still wouldn't meet them anon
if I lived in Germany I'd have a gf already, if I lived in latvia or romania I'd also have one, if I lived in england I'd have several, if I lived in the US or Canada I'd be king of the fucking world.
I've talked to so many girls and edated them all from those places, I could've had it all if I just lived there. it's absurdly easy to find a random fembot tier girl in the US, any state any town you can imagine, within maybe a week or two of searching
--- 73083530
>>73083506
Then why didn't it work out? You could have moved since you don't like it in the Netherlands. Long distance can work. Especially if it's just around Europe.
--- 73083563
>>73083503
If you're in a relationship then you two were never robots to begin with, retard. Fuck off normalfaggot.
--- 73083567
>>73083530
i was either in college, or they were in college, or they found someone irl sooner, or got tired of distance. Now that I think about it I have never met a fembot who finished education and was working. They all just find someone eventually irl.
--- 73083601
>>73083567
Yeah you need older fembots. The younger ones that are neets make bad partners. The older ones are pretty chill imo. I have a few older femanons as online friends and they are great. My ex had a degree and job and she was stable. Just needed a little push here and there. 
But I get the distance part. When you start working the time zone difference also can seriously be a nuisance.
--- 73083610
>>73083601
>I have a few older femanons as online friends and they are great.
bro what the fuck you're hoarding all the femanons.. this is why i don't get any adds anymore on r9k or soc... thanks.
do any of them send you nudes
--- 73083618
>>73083563
I'm kidding anon.
>>73083610
>you're hoarding all the femanons
They only go for really attractive guys, so yeah lol it happens.
--- 73083625
>>73083618
post some nudes they sent you
--- 73083641
>>73083610
No? They are friends. We talk about random shit and voice chat once in a while. I have no sexual interest in them and neither do they in me. You know. As friends tend to do. 
If you want nudes check out reddit. Especially the bdsm/kinky subreddits. But it can take a while to find girls that respond and are willing to exchange stuff.
--- 73083661
>>73083641

Men and woman cannot be friends. someone is having ulterior motives, or something else fucky is going on

I'm like a 5 to 6. Maybe a 7 on a good day. My body is nothing special. Hell I don't tend to show my face until I've talked to someone for a few weeks. 
>>73083661
Apparently they can be since I've been talking to one of them for over 2 years now. Never did anything lewd. Fucked up conversations or even discussing kinks? Sure but it never went further and I prefer it that way. I don't even know what she looks like. And the same goes for her.

Straight men can't rate themselves for shit. But 6-7/10 is still well above average.
--- 73083716
>>73083682
where do you meet them? So far about 9/9 femanons who added me from soc have been total fucking brick walls, I'm so pissed off I might actually start some autistic spreadsheet so I can keep track of how unlucky I am. It's almost comical
--- 73083733
>>73083701
I got rated online on various websites. But thanks for trying. Since I have 0 luck with women in real life I take the ratings I got with a giant grain of salt. 
>>73083716
I rarely go out of my way to add people. But usually here or /soc/. It's a numbers game. Simple as. People from /soc/ are terrible human beings on average imo. It's normie central.

I genuinely wish I had more time to consume media.

as someone who has consumed a lot of media, there is much less good stuff then you'd think

It's not just about quantity for me, more about wanting to be able to really take my time with the things I do wanna play/watch/read. It takes time and patience to really get immersed into something

Before I got brain damaged, I remember I sensed a similarity beetween every single piece of information ever, everything I've read I understood why it was that way and instantly remembered something else exactly if not almost like it. So if you were intelligent, trust me it would suck, everything is a loop of another thing when you're smart

Yeah but you would miss the fan service tho. But it's just the character interactions late game and a bit into the game mostly.

The last one I watched was years ago, can't be of help there. 
The last show I watched was a mess of a show called Mayoiga. It's fun even if you don't like it lmao.

If you haven't seen Ping Pong the Animation or Kaiji ,you should watch those.

I'm at this stage myself. Haven't consumed good entertainment in years, regardless of genre. Kinda sad about it.
How'd you deal with this?

I currently have some sperm in my body that I need to deposit somewhere. You have a vagina, which seems to me like a pretty good place for storing sperm. So the offer is, I put my dick inside of you, thrust for a few minutes, and empty my body of sperm that will be absorbed into your body. So, I get to be relieved of the burden of carrying all this excess sperm around, and you get the valuable nutrients contained within the sperm.
What do you think? Do we have a deal?

The vagina is a hostile environment for sperm. There's no nutrition gained.

Feels fantastic, and hearing her beg for me to cum inside her makes me shoot ropes, but fuck man, just wish I could come to terms that I'm shooting blanks now!

But no, the day I let my dick anywhere near a tranny hole will be a cold day in hell.

You don't understand, my sperm is very different from other mens' sperm, it contains no DNA, only valuable nutrients that contribute to good health.

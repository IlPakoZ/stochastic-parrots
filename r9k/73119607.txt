Why is it considered normal for a white male to begin balding in his early 20s and be totally and completely bald by his early 30s. Why?
If this were any other race of men, it would be considered a global health epidemic and billions would be invested into finding a reason and solution.
So why is this terrible, disfiguring affliction simply accepted as normal? Why do we let these poor creatures suffer in misery? 

(Not me in pic btw, it was the first image result I found while googling for white men)

Why is Samuel like this? Why is there such a strong correlation with baldness and insanity?

if anything has proven the sanity of the average 4chan user, it's this. if 4chan users were as unhinged as people say, this would have happened long ago. thankfully in reality we're all just disillusioned losers

society is denial about this because they're dogs when it comes to being critical of food

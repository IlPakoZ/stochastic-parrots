Why?

You have a crossdressing fetish retard

Can't, I'm a grown man with children, a family, etc.
10 years ago I experimented with cross-dressing one time and an older man (in his late 40s) told his Asian girlfriend (who gave me all the girl clothes as a joke) at the time to give me a bunch of drugs, which I naively took all at once to show off to the girl because I wanted to fuck the girl. Well I was barely conscious after a few minutes and the older man raped my mouth and left me passed out in his house. True story.

Also the sight of my very masculine face after cross-dressing is painful to see. I'm not pretty in a dress. But for some reason a single skirt seems appealing.

By "seems appealing" do you mean you just want some skin contact on your legs, or do you mean it makes you horny. If the former, just wear a kilt or something. The latter is definitely a fetish though.
>but I'm not scottish
Don't wear a tartan kilt, just a normal one.

you aren't straight, youre a faggot

as an actual straight man, if I see a guy doing this in public, in my mind you are 100% a pedophile, as are all gay people.

I want the fabric to be thin and soft for some reason. Just seems similar to wearing only underpants. I have times I wish I looked like a girl though, but I have 0 attraction to the male body in any way. I like soft-looking things.

I'm a 5'3 20 year old male with a 5.5 inch penis. How over is it for me?

Your dicksize is fine, focus on getting status and fit and you'll be good. Unless you wanna transmax or whatever, you got the height for it.

20? Honestly pretty fucked. You live in the most shallow generation of them all where women your age literally refuse to treat any white male shorter than 6'0" as a human being.
I am 35 myself, short as well but substantially taller, slightly bigger dick but still smaller side of average, good looking, and wealthy. Women do not pay any attention to me, even when they know I have money, and I don't have a sign on me advertising my dick size so clearly I can deduce that my height of 5'8" is the problem.
I AM married. I got married to an older woman. She's 9 years older than me. Women of the late millenial/early genX generation are far less picky than zoomer trash women.

If you have to post on /r9k/ asking how over it is, the answer is that you should have shot yourself instead of making this post.

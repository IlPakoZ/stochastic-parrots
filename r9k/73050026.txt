Now what am I supposed to do?

Normie women are very unrelatable to me, I'm not motivated at all to go after such types.
After these long years of loneliness and virginity, I really crave a deep connection, someone to be forever with.
I don't even want to have sex with some random girls in hopes of getting some practice, some extra confidence, or whatever the fuck.

What would you recommend that I do now?

Single moms on tinder. They are easier because nobody wants them.

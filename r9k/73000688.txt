why do people blame Oppenheimer for people missing nuclear weapons as if him creating something makes him solely responsible?

if he didn't so it someone else would have eventually.

>why do actions have consequences 
It's as if a dumb whore roastie made this post, or just a dumb equally retarded contrarian. 
That being said nukes are fake though, japan was carpet bombed.

but someone else would have done it anyway. this inevitable with or without him. you just want one guy person to blame when it's not as black and white as that.

If I don't rape you someone else would have therefore you can't punish me and send me to jail.

This timeline is all fucked up. It should have been the vedic nazi kshatriyas who wielded the brahmastra weapons, not the demoniac kikes.

If he didn't make it, maybe the next most probable inventor of nukes would've been stopped or delayed enough? After that, maybe people could learn that nukes are bad without letting loose any? Have you ever thought that it could've went like that?

If I didn't rape you, maybe you would be lucky for the rest of your life that you won't ever be in a situation where you would be easily rapeable?
But nahh, if you were defenseless in front of me and I refused to rape you because I have good taste in women, that just means you'll get raped by someone else eventually.

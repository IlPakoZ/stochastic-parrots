>Because that's the only way you people can survive. You need everything to be heavily censored so your views aren't BTFO.
no, it's because you "people" will just raid and shit up everywhere that doesn't keep you out. you're gremlins that try to shit up everything on this planet. the default behavioral mode of the far-rightist is to run from room to room and scream about jews and trannies and conspiracy theories until either they get banned or they don't get banned, and then if they don't get banned they invite their friends over

You don't even know what far-right is to begin with. Typical retard that just spouts nonsense while your kind are the ones that ruin entire cities and countries, move when it gets too bad, and then does the same shit again in your new place.

For instance, this shit would get moved to /ywnbaw/.

Just for the record. Me, you, and fucking nobody gave two shits about trans until Bruce Jenner chopped his dick off and went on a media tour. Now it's your call to battle against your internet political enemies, which is fine. Except here we're all anonymous bullshitters trolling each other. You don't know who's sincere and who's fucking with you. All the pro-trans posts could be by one weird fetishist who likes it when you get pissed off at his stuff.

All I'm saying is crusading about anything here is utterly meaningless and makes you look like a clueless fool. Especially when you've been doing it for 7 years straight to no avail. Like, what is the endgame? Just eternal seething about internet-people you'll never meet? What kind of life is that?
--- 73032058
>>73031968
I've posted on 4chan for 15+ years and have shifted from standard free speech absolutist to extremely pro-censorship. real freedom is allowing people to make their own places and moderate them as they see fit, not dictating some owner allow everything and let their site be flooded by absolute retards. I'm still a free speech absolutist when it comes to the law (as all americans should be), but when it comes to moderating websites, censor me the fuck up senpai
--- 73032101
>>73032058
Then you aren't for free speech at all. You only want free speech when it benefits you and your ideology. That's how your kind is and why you all shit yourself when Twitter was bought. You love your echo chambers because those are the only places your ideas aren't BTFO. You are the softest fuckers on the planet. Keep sucking that jewish globohomo cock.

>>73032101
I'm not >>73032058, but let me respond.

It's not about safeguarding ideals here. Which would be pointless, we've been saying all kinds of awful shit since the inception of this website.

It's about gatekeeping retards from transforming a thing you spent time and effort building up to something great into a worthless cesspool of humorless, stupid, social media filth that no one but the basest trash wants to participate in.

Imagine if you had a clubhouse that you spent years building up, carefully inviting new members, and molding into something that brought you real joy. Then angry whooping dimwits charged through your door by hundreds, shouted "This is our clubhouse now", and starting shitting and pissing all over the floor. If you wanted them out, would you be "censoring" them?
--- 73032318
>>73031258 (OP)
I would ban POL.

I don't understand how it's 2023 already and people can still tolerate actual racism against other human beings. Like just no. Stop. It is not ok. It is never ok.

It's like how is this still our world? I have a black boyfriend and there are actual Nazis on this website who would kill us for that. Does that make sense?

Like, we've been to the moon. We've invented cell phones. How can there still be actual hate for someone's skin color. It makes me sick.
--- 73032348

--- 73032479
>>73032318
Weird attempt at ps-yop. Fakin naivety in order to paint one side as stupid. 1% chance genuine confusion.

Of course there are racists around. What you think. Current movements, rulers, legislators, do not benefit from that shit? 
They actively enforce racism through propaganda, Fox-news, through other outlets. In united states there still are sundown towns. Supposed bastion of "diversity, modernity and racial tolerance" When in reality, whenever you get passport, get registered, they sign you as something out of "three" races. Wait, let me correct that. Think "latino" counts as 4th for them.
Interestingly enough. Also, "anti-racist movements" benefit from racism too. Like black lives matter. They would not be able to exist without racism. Not be able to get funded.

>>73031258 (OP)
Think nothing would be solved by deleting a board. Things would be solved only by adding new ones. Fragment it into like xchan type of mess. Make boards for "lefty-extremists" and "right-extremists" and watch the show and /pol/ empty.

Are we supposed to unlock certain stuff at random years? Historically we were at one of the most peaceful times in 2000s yet there were still wars 3 decades ago the US decided to shell yugoslavia with uranium that wasn't nice either 
And censorship is never the answer if you simply refuse or try to hunt down a group then you will only grow hate and make them work underground nothing else (unless you unironically think /pol is the main racist central) and racism is part of freedom, I can freely hate anyone based on anything I want it can be your hair colour as well or tattoos or whatever really, but also it is not "just" skin colour anyone who thinks that should look at bone structure and general facial structure and so on the difference between an african and a caucasian is almost exactly the same level as they would have been to neanderthals, except they went extinct/got breeded out 
There are laws that fordid murder but there are still psychopaths who do murder people not only because of racism butany reasons, but everyone should be able to freely express themselves completely
--- 73032711

We are all the same and a nazi like you will never understand that.

Look at Harry Potter to see what happens to nazis in the end. Voldemort was a smallminded skinhead who only knew hate and he was defeated by the strong witches and wizards who he thought were lesser. That's proof that you will never win.

You're beliefs are also disgustingly antiscience. There's no such thing as different humans, because at the end of the day, we all bleed red.

I am for full freedom to allow everyone to think what they want and also say it, only you want to censor people you dislike so who is the nazi? I feel like you are as I did not even say we are different SPECIES but race we are the human SPECIES and we have different races but to explain to someone like you, terrier, pitbull, beagle they are all dogs you would not say a beagle is not a dog yet it is a subcategory of the dog species, you claiming that we are completely the same and one is the antiscience one as you cleary cant see anatomical differences just cry that noooo you cant hate them because of x reason yet the only thing you focus on is their tone of skin while I was talking about genetical differences in evolution which you deny exists yet every science book would show you different skullshapes for different races 
Also quite stupid to say that we all bleed red, most mammals and most creatures bleed red
But either way discussion with someone that wrongfully uses the term nazi on a person that did not claim to be racist then quote a fictional story as a reason why something doesnt work and other stupidity its either the finest of baits or a call to me from reality how stupid assuming people can get

I just want to be alive in the year 2080 when I'd be 83 years old and it would 100 years since the 1980s so people would finally forget the damn decade and little kids would walk up to me and say, "Gee mister, you sure are old! Do you remember the 1980's?" I would smirk and pause for a while then reply, "Yeah I remember that piece of shit worthless decade that contributed nothing to humanity and was the cause of the downfall of Old America". Kid would reply, "What's Old America? "I thought it was always called the New Order of The United States of Americas"......

If you weren't even alive in the 1980s why do you hate it or have opinions on it?
Speaking as an anon who was alive during the 1980s.

Because he would've known people whose formative years were in the 1980s. He would've spoken to them. Same way someone born in the 2020's will interact with someone like us born in the 90s/early 2000's and they will ask us what the 2020s were like in 2043.

Life is really unfair.
I was not handed anything I enjoy in life, but girls hate me as well, so I am 26 years old and have never kissed a girl. I don't even have any friends or siblings in life.

It is worse because I know there are nukes coming in another 100 years as well, so it makes me feel like killing the people I live around. If they cheat me and don't build a bunker for me, I am just going to buy body armor, an AR-15 and helmet with a silencer, and go on a rampage after the nukes hit houston.

Did you ever play dayz mod? Those were good times so comfy. That game used to actually scare me

I never got the chance to do so to a serious extent. I've primarily played the standalone.

I used to play Altis Life though in Arma 3 which is probably similar to DayZ Mod.

I guess it is.
I really don't think they're going to do anything right for me. They're going to know what they are building and probably run away from their jobs on purpose.

I really do think it's just going to be me in my house with some body armor, a supply of food and water, and a gun in the end. I don't trust the people to help me, and I know I can not build my own bunker by myself. It's worse than building a house.

It's for the gun so people don't hear anything and get murdered.

not him but you missed the fuck out bro
summer 2014 was an absolute magical time when Dayz Overpoch came out (Epoch + Overwatch mods), the servers were so crowded that six 64 player servers were rented just for one clan and it wasnt enough

I was playing Epoch when it was released. I never met any players though.

Epoch never reached the player counts Overpoch did.

I did have some good memories of playing Epoch and games like Breaking point, but I never got to player DayZ Overpoch. I think I had issues hooking up the mods or something because it was DayZ based. I think it was the NSA blocking me from playing.

Just had a dream about fucking hookers and fighting a crackhead.

Jesus my leg is fucked up from my accident and I don't know if the place will accept basically my whole body needs PT. I hate the healthcare system man I just want things to be easy and they're not and DXM is my only relief from the pain.

sup friends
I haven't really posted here in a year, maybe two. I used to be one of the resident DXM addicts. Might remember me by my images. After taking 900mg every other day for like a year, I quit two years ago. I'm back on my bullshit though because my chronic pain has gotten unbearable - just took 450mg in HBr tablets. I just want to get to a point where I don't hurt as much so I can take a few psychs and fix the part of my brain that keeps doing this shit.
Love you drugfeel, sorry for blogposting. To be more on-topic: anyone play VR while on DXM? shit's kinda crazy. You completely lose your body and become the game-world. Gonna watch tron legacy in 3d in VR tonight.

Anybody else wildly abuse free samples or intro offers on darknet markets? I actively search for them every time on there. 

Yesterday grabbed 1g hash for like 3 quid, 1g ketamine for 4 quid, and 0.1g of coke for 2 quid, although hoping they'll stick a bit more than 0.1 in there for a good review. 

I've had my account for over a year and a lot of sales so am considered a trusted buyer, but probably more than half of my purchases are free samples or intro offers. Always search for those terms too.
--- 73038632

Britbong here. How much would Dexamphetamine go for theoretically in minecraft? I theoretically know somebody in roblox who hypothetically gets prescribed more than they take in fortnite and I can't get any off him because neither of us really know what it's worth.

Anyone know why opis sometimes have little effect on me but other times they affect me strongly?

100% know they're uncut, I was thinking it might have to do with sleep? Sometimes I "forget" I didn't sleep and only get an hour or two, last night I got a full 8 and they're hitting strong today.

I always take after eating breakfast which is always three large hardboiled eggs and a zero calorie monster energy 


Going to try to keep good track of my sleep going forward and see if that's it.

Does anybody else like to vape weed with some psychedelic sprinkled on it? I'm using metocin cause it works quite well, although I'm sure it's not the most efficient method, but it's perfect if you want a slight and short trip

What else did you eat beyond the mushrooms before hand? It is recommended to fast the day of (and even the day before) you take psychedelics. Especially mushrooms.

Though it could be a case of gut rot which mushrooms can cause. You may have to lemon tek, capsulize or get an extract of mushrooms to alleviate gut rot.
--- 73041626
Amanita Muscaria: anyone here tried these shrooms? wonder how it compares to Phenibut. especially anxiety suppression or to mix with psychs
--- 73041897
can i drink, say, a few shots of whiskey or a few cans of beer a day or two after i took a strong dose of phenibut? or would this fuck me over since they both interact with the goober receptors or whatever
i wonder if they can both share tolerance or withdrawal because if not i may alternate a bit between the two
nothing too crazy mind you, i don't plan on having anxiety rebound or just straight-up insomnia

they interact with different GABA receptors, but it's likely you'll have mounting withdrawal just from the psychological effects, not necessarily physical ones.

Phenibut is still having after-effects the next day and it will be added on top of the alcohol. Keep that in mind if you're going to drink or just wait a day more.

It entirely depends on what the drug economy is like in the UK. 
In Australia a bottle of dexies sells for $350-450 Australian dollars depending on if they like you or not. I bought 5 off a mate the other day for some assignment assistance.

Additionally I'd like to mention that if anyone read the post in the comfy 4/20 edition thread, detailing how I was going to get a prescription for ADD and purchased some to try
I took one 5mg pill and it really helped to sit down and get my assignment done, granted I was a lil bit more retarded than when I'm on my A game, but I found I could focus on work easier and quit engaging with distractions faster. 
I think I'll continue to use when I'm struggling with getting motivated.

i used to vape little bits of DPT hcl (always wanted to freebase it but never got around to it) and it was cool. sometimes i'd be on MDMA or whatever and i'd just smoke some DPT with my weed for the hell of it. i did it on acid once and got unbelievably high, i think LSDPT is a special combo

How do I use shrooms beneficially? I mean it helped me to become a more relaxed person and I developed a better empathy but I don't really think or do anything while tripping, I just listen to music and enjoy the visuals popping in my head. I'm not saying its bad or boring but I feel like I am wasting its potential by using it just for fun, like consuming a protein powder for its taste and not working on muscles.

Not really, dispensary had deals but was overpacked. I tried to get some stuff and they did not have it.

Then I got pizza after as I thought I will not feel like cooking later and it sucked ass so my whole day was ruined.

Took some alpha today, ended up jacking off 5 times, ended up doing 500 generations in stable diffusion and using koboldai to write few pages of smut.
I'm actually starting to get a hang of how this substance actually works and how to use it without going into infinite redose loop. The substance itself basically sucks, only first dose feels good and any redoses only make the duration longer. What really matters is doing something fun so your dopamine can actually stack without having to rely on redosing.

I used to watch PsychedSubstance back in 2017/18. I found his videos interesting, especially where he would try different type of drugs, and even sometimes interview scientists. 
Now he just makes videos of him reacting to creepypasta-but-drugs nonsense that no one really finds entertaining, and some occasional lulzy "my wife left me", "my wife and i are together again" videos. 

It's sad to see what happened to him. I guess he gotta finance his test and drug addiction somehow with minimum effort. 

How is everyone on /drugfeel/ doing btw? Haven't been here since last summer
--- 73052239
Man phenibut is on the way out, we're getting increasing amounts of stupid questions about how to take it and what not to take it with and all the dumb shit that can be looked up in literally 10 seconds. This means the kids are getting their mitts on it and it's only a matter of time before some dumb fuck gets addicted and blows his head off during withdrawal, then it'll be banned and subject to the black market and then everyone's favourite once a week drug is being poorly made by dark Chinese labs. Probably a good idea to stock up.
--- 73052354
>>73051954
it's fun, but if you have any, any at all way to avoid loneliness during the roll that is my highest recommendation. feelings like rejection and heartbreak hit indescribably hard on mdma so be mindful of that and don't let yourself spiral when you could be enjoying the experience

Unless you're like me, dxm just caused me to relive my life and forget some parts of it. Made me text my parents I loved them well forgetting all the fucked up shit they've done.

Granted I've done fucked up shit to, and dxm helped me realize how they saw things but still they never apologized for their actions and I have l.

So I guess, don't take dxm of you're looking to escape

Highest I got was completely forgetting who I was, I went from in bed reliving my life unable to move to walking around my apartment with no idea who or what j was, my internal voice was gone but eventually I asked myself "who am I?" I then responded "oh yeah I'm anon" shook my head and laughed.

Overall it was an interesting trip, but not something I'd ever want to repeat

I meant highest plateau well tripping, I've never really done weed, lasts too long in system.

I'm so fucked up from last night still, opis have been hitting stronger than usual for some reason and I nearly died. Third time it has happened and the rebound has been getting a lot worse, or it could just be withdrawal because I've been out for so long

Bro I will never live a normal life. I take medicine with every meal. I have to watch my diet for fatty foods and small meals. I have to take 3 long term pain management drugs and 2 for emergencies. I will never live a normal life again. Learn from my mistakes and just give your body time to recover before you cross the point of no return. Pancreatitis never heals because you always need to eat. It's like a broken leg you still gotta walk on for the rest of your life. Surgeries to inject pain blocker. Surgeries to install drainage ducts. Surgeries to scrape off necrotic rotting flesh and decrease likelihood of 97% mortality rate pancreatitic cancer. I've been telling everybody I can tell and I'm begging you to learn from my mistakes and not the hard way. Here we are on 4chan together on Friday talking about drinking brother we are exactly the same and I love you and I don't want you to suffer like me. It's not fucking worth it ever.

SATIVA VS INDICA ISNT FUCKING REAL
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN EFFECT BETWEEN STRAINS IN DETERMINED BY CBD-CBN-THC ALKALOID RATIO AND TERPENE PROFILES
AAAAAGHHGHGH IT ONYL TAKES 30 SECONDS OF THINKING LOGICALLY TO REALIZE THAT SATIVA STRAINS AREN'T INHERENTLY STIMULATING

Oh god I had withdrawal from pregabalin and it was hell i couldn't sleep had fever and felt like i was dying. I remember when i took oxya i forgot that i took pregabalin and i couldn't feel my body everything was tingling and i felt like passing out on my way home
--- 73054893
just got into concentrates. shits pretty dope. just vaping shatter, is it worth the extra money for some live rosin or other weird more exotic shit? its like $35 for a gram of shatter but $60-80 for live rosin
in general i mean, i know its all context dependent. anyway bout to take another dab and maybe some RSO while i wait for my MDMA to show up
BWH
--- 73054909
>>73054875
as long as you want. its probably not going to kill you. 
unless you just shoved like a quarter gram up your nose, then i'd wait at least around 6 hours.

it takes around 90 mins to fully comeup from intranasal amph. you are probably peaking right now, so its up to you if you need to tweak harder

400mg of HBr is 292mg of freebase
--- 73054946
>>73054875
how long did it take for you to start feeling it?
--- 73054951
>>73049398
you could try benzos (it will also eliminate anxiety from the weed, benzos are best combined with some THC) or other GABAergic drugs like gabapentoids, GHB, phenibut etc.
--- 73055003
>>73054946
come-up was about 15 minutes, currently /feelingit/ but I don't wanna stay up until noon tomorrow, so I'm concidering just taking the rest now and tweek out for a short time rather than a long binge

going around the woods is really fun on mdma but doing it on your own is retarded.

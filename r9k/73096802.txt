It's weird. I know female sexuality exists, but I have never seen it in person, so all I can imagine a girl's reaction would be to even flirting is utter disgust. They basically display disgust towards sex 99% of the time anyways.
How to get rid of this mental block?

Every woman I've been around was extremely spiteful and seething towards men at large. You'll never see their sexuality unless the top 0.01% of men are near

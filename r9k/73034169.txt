>tfw most other fembots are straight girls with cluster b personality disorders who hate other women.
Why live? I just want to meet other NEET bi or gay (biological) girls and stay inside and make each other cum all day.

I saw like 3 posts talking about chad after not scrolling for that long. No woman cares about this mystical being known as chad, epically a lesbian.
>>73034294
I'm not really into yaoi but its not like I have anything against it! I have a few M/M ships I like.

Neet is someone who is not in education employment or training
hikki is someone who is a shut in and doesn't leave his room/house for long periods of time
so pray tell, how do you not leave your room for long periods of time if you happen to be employed my dear madam?

I dont know. Up to you to decided whether or not you think its natural or whatever. I grew up with both my parents and they have a great marriage. I just never liked boys.
--- 73037028
>>73037017

>>73037028
Nope. I had my first crush on a girl in 4th grade. Wasnt sexual or anything obviously since I was like 10 but I had all the stereotypical childhood crush feelings. And I am a gold star lesbian, in fact self brag but id make a new tier up for me. A platinum star lesbian. I have never held hands with, kissed, let alone had sex with a boy.

i feel like I'm at the end of my rope. it's been two years since I left university I can't even get a shitty job because of my fucking autism.

whatever opportunities i just never seem to work as it does for everyone else. 

i'm completely fucked.

Are you sure its because of your autism and that others in your city/state/field aren't also going through the same experience?

I like you, anon. Challenging his beliefs without being a dick about it.

I spent 2 years unemployed after graduating too, then got a shitty 6 month temp job, then was unemployed for another year before I got my current 3 month temp job. Job field isn't easy right now, everyone's begging for workers and then I get ghosted on 300 job applications in a row.

Maybe it's because the market is saturated.

Thank you for noticing. I don't think going down the "tough love" route telling people to suck it up by insulting them to be helpful at all. Its the complete opposite of help.

Clearly your handshake and smile weren't firm or wide enough, respectively.

The world needs more people like you and I mean it. Your friends are lucky to have a empathetic/understanding individual such as yourself. Have agood one.

Thank you anon. I feel the same way. The world could use a little bit of empathy. And I'm honestly surprised to run into someone here who I can relate to in this way.

It sounds kind of gay, but I'm not ashamed to say it. The world needs more love, especially men these days with the isolation they experience. I literally tell my best friend I love him because he's my brother, my family at this point. I wish more people were open to expressing how much they cared for the people in their lives. Tough love can be useful at times, but we really need to be more compassionate with each other (people like OP). Life is hard, literally drives people to kill themselves at times. Being there for one another is important, I know I sound like a hippie lol. As I said before, keep at it and don't let this world take this part of you.

I personally wouldn't say "I love you" outside of a romantic setting because it can come off a little too strong and make people shell up. But little things like actually, genuinely listening to them and not judging them for anything, and not blaming them for their condition, is noticeable enough and still subtle at the same time. Because most people don't do any of that stuff. They see a person in pain asking for help and they either go for the toxic positivity "just be happy" bullshit, or the "pull yourself up by your bootstraps whiny idiot" route. Its not common to see people acting from a genuine place of care and empathy.

You too brother

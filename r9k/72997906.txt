Diogenes was worst than you and he did (until we know) zero, nill, None fucks. Now he is considered by a lot of people as one of the most badass person in history.

Lesson of the tale? Learn to don't give a fuck and masturbate in public.

You don't, and I'm heading towards the exact same path with no way out.
You just have to cope with alcohol drugs and prostitutes and hope you die sooner rather than later I dunno.

I'm just as much a "loser" as you and in my mid 30s, but I'm happy because I'm a NEET. That is how I cope, I don't do shit for no boss, and my time is mine to enjoy. I read, keep fit, have lots of fun watching movies, youtube videos and doing other thing online, and even go outside for long walks every day. You are sad because you are wage-slaving knowing full well that it's all for nothing.

You're not a loser if you're poor, you're just poor. It's just money, don't take it so seriously. Whenever I worry about money it makes me feel better to think about how the amount of money I'm stressing about would probably be nothing, just absolutely laughable to someone who's rich. I know that sounds weird, how would that make you feel better? but it's because it reminds me that it's mostly just RANDOM. They had more opportunities, or connections, or rich parents, or parents who taught them about money young, or just luck, or maybe they just genetically have a brain that makes them better with money, who knows. Just totally different conditions. It's greatly out of your control, so how does that make you a loser?

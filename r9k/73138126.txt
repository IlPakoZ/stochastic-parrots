I only want to talk to you, it's been an entire year since the last word you said to me and you wouldnt talk to me once about anything. If we could have just talked all of this wouldn't be happening we would be sitting next to eachother still and having fun and happiness the world would be so much more meaningful if you could come back and we could help eachother to understand and be what we wanted for 2 years I love you and I'm willing to do anything even when everyone is out to get me and accuses me of things I could never think of I'm only here for you

Over the course of my life it's become obvious that glowfaggots are what make things shitty and normie.
When it's the smart ones, like in the early internet, things can be cool.

Dear Unknown

It has come to my attention that I am not fully competent anymore, I have spent a good part of my life changing and adapting to a point of none normal communication or actions. Now I know deep down I mean well, I just can't relate to anyone at any level. I feel isolated with everyone around me and even tho they talk to me I just can't communicate on their level, I try to lower myself to this basic talk but I already know what they are going to say before they open their mouths. Mistakes are made and I am left to pick up what went wrong, I know all my life I had to be someone I am not and act a certain way to fit in but it gets so tiring. So for the best part of 4 years I decided to leave everyone alone and stay in my own bubble, away from their problems and drama. It was the best four years of my life, pure freedom 

So Unknown I speak to you in this letter as a way of thanking you for being here with me , with my nonsense rambling I feel better unloading stress and pretending I am letting out a small piece of aggression in to this space. I am starting to wish people could just live their lives in caves away from the stress and fast pace of life, which as humans we should have made better, but the people in control don't. 

So dear Unknown I just want to say thank you and I love you, even If you never see me or hear from me, know I am in this world thinking of you and loving you with cyber love.
Yours sincerely

2 of your problems are curable, I know of Movie 
 Industry Secrets which can fix both quickly, 

Bad News is selfish, I'll only tell you of the fixes to your problems if you email me at KrylonCures@tutanota.com
I don't mean to weigh you down but I have been comtemplating whacking myself too, i even set actual tentative deadline for my birthday 2-3 months in the future. 
When I see these cries for help, whether or not they are "mopey" out of exhaustion or legitimate cries for help, i take them Very Very seriously and I want you to email me right away, okay? Don't delay, as soon as you get this (you) drop me a line and just dump whatevers on your mind. i dont' really feel worth a damn unles i can help someone else, i could've made a fine psychologist or counselor but i have psychiatric issues myself and am on neetbux for disability. 
 Idc if this is a bit forward, even if there is a chance of this being a bot, I will not stand to see another robot brother potentially off themself due to a failed relationship, or whatever it is you're going through, you are more than welcome to dump on me whatever it is you need to vent about, because i actually do care for and about you. as katy perry would say, you're 1 in 7 billion, and the bottom line is, You Matter. Period. so i insist that you shoot me an email and let me help, K? i love you you son of a bitch if you don't stick around Robot9001 wont be worth it, and all hope is lost. hang in there. 
sincerely, 
youre embarrassingly sentimental long-time robot friend

maybe too many parallels is the problem, as in we get so many alternate versions of our own experiences running through ours and others minds it's like they just start compounding into the shared idea of what's really going on, all the while everyone still running their own separate wheels churning off more energy into the cloud, and that storm is just raging back and forth in and out of light showers to hurricane winds, and the real idea is to either see it all as perfect or do what you can to deal with the weather, or both, but you still gotta be dealing with the same laws of winds, evaporation and gravity sending what water where 

or maybe that's actually just a bunch of words and who gives a fuck what I think about what is basically just basic fucking social dynamics that dehydration don't foster into

Never any less capable, but yes, finally, perhaps less willing to choose and ensure.

And for that I resent quite a few of you. I would like to not have to. I would like to not.

But you chose what you liked, and now I am tasked with bringing it all together. But then what? I have to love that much harder so you do not just end up all boo hoo you did it, you really did it, and now all I feel is guilt for what I put you through so I have to throw it all away regardless?

Next life can I have friends who won't turn into fucking assholes when they hit their thirties?
--- 73150922
For that matter can I have an actual family? Not just two women who are constantly angry at each other and vehemently despise men? Can I have relatives who don't noticeably denigrate anyone who reminds me of the men I who were my relatives before retarded women chased them all off?
Can I have anything in my life that isn't ruined by irrational dickheads with insane double standards claiming moral superiority even though they're the stupidest most philosophically inept and most dishonest people I could possibly imagine?

Can glowies stop doing things to force us all to hang out with total fucking faggots nonstop for our entire lives? Do you think that might reduce some social turmoil, removing the moratorium on non-fuckheads being permitted to associate with each other?

Is it really that hard? Is it really such a rare trait, an inclination *against* being a dishonest tool who just says whatever it takes for their faggot ingroup to get its way?
Aren't there still people who dislike being ridiculous, lying pieces of shit?

Here's a tip: If the only way you can tell yourself you're a good person is by thinking, "oh well reality isn't real anyway," you're not a fucking good person.
--- 73150982
>>73150969
who the fuck says reality isn't real

>>73150982
Post-structural philosophy underpins the past 40 years of leftist activism.
You're right though, actually. Most of the people who do this have absolutely no clue about what philosophy underpins their dishonest, so I'll amend my statement:

If the only way you can tell yourself you're a good person is by finding an "expert" who says you're exempt from being honest about reality, you're not a good person.

>>73151005
ok good to clarify that just making sure I am indeed not a good person

*sound effect*
--- 73151080
>>73151061
Cool, so I'll just note a corollary here is that when you go around holding others to the standards a good person might be held to, you're also a hypocrite. I mean really, once you go there, you've pretty much just turned the corner on being a complete asshole and a fraud.
--- 73151112
There is a reason most leftist activists hate each other. They tend to be very cruel and vindictive in general. It's not about building, it's about tearing down. Is some tearing down justified? Sure, but only the minimum necessary, and historical leftist movements often go far beyond that. Killing random white people with no power in South Africa doesn't heal the pain of systemic racism, only fuels it, and should a revolution succeed in killing all the whites there, who is next to be subject to the ire of the populace? It's not about power struggles anymore, it's about bloodthirst at that point.
--- 73151131
Hmmm quite, indeed. As always, reading your posts carefully and making notes on my end for future contemplation and hopefully edification. Ah, perchance.
--- 73151155
Many hate poor whites like me the most because no matter how much we care it's all "disingenuous white guilt" because we couldn't change anything even if we tried. But if we accept that and don't care about that which we cannot control.

And this is one example. There is no winning.
--- 73151166
There's also that whole thing about how they emphatically reject material realism and how that's essentially a refusal to admit that other people have to share the same universe as you.
It turns out narrative continuity is hard to maintain when you've got 150 million twinks who are all secretly convinced as a matter of faith that they're the main character.

Try framing the problem in realistic, coherent terms instead of just acquiring the correct opinions and then refusing to admit you can't defend them.

e.g. in-group bias is the root of most of the valid problems along these lines. (Unfortunately, if this becomes widely admitted, then all the groupthinking, mobbing pieces of shit being played like a fiddle by the DNC will see their platforms self-annihilate.)

Your post is coherent if I take your conclusion to be that the realistic, honest position leads to the appearance of being callous.

--- 73151436

--- 73151459

Yeah no disagreement there; I just think we should stop granting their premises. The ire should be directed at those in power, and it should be about intersectionality instead of just race.

>>73151484
Voting does very little. Usually the "choices" are limited in difference. If the voters vote for the worse side there is some accountability but really the main ire should be towards those actually failing to fix the legislation or how it is enforced. People like politicians, police chiefs, prison and ward owners, etc.
--- 73151632
>>73151484
>>73151604
Also, to add on -- unless people wear their votes on their sleeve, you don't know who they even voted for. If you see a "MAGA" boomer, is he responsible for Trump's worst acts? In some small way, but only in being a useful idiot. He shouldn't be killed, maybe laughed at a bit.

But there are philosophies and worldviews underpinning the attitudes and behaviors of those officials, and we systemically select for a handful which are plainly harmful if we take it for granted that physical reality exists.

If we're going to do activism, then when identifying the problem to solve, why not at least find the real problem and then do activism based on true principles.

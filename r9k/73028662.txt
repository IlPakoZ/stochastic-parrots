Screwed over by parents too? I wish I could be more assertive and rebellious. I feel like I'm like Butters from south park, except my parents aren't abusive more, christian.

Yeah my parents were/are fucking idiots. They think as long as god exists and is in control, everything is going to be okay.

Tell me about it. Moved across the country and I was forced to give up my life savings so that we wouldnt end up homeless. And I couldn't not move and lived by my self because I was homeschooled and socially retarded.

Bro I moved to a whole different country and it fucked me up more than I thought it would. Now I'm back to where I was born (usa/belly of the beast) and i feel disconnected from everyone i come across in public. I cant stand my fucking family.

Gnostic philosiphy was a mistake. I wish we retained pagan ideals of local traditions over the idea of a higher spiritual realm that is above the Earth.

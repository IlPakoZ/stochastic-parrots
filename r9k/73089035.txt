Fbots how do your feet smell? You can answer honestly
--- 73089040
Depends. If I just got home from work, luck a chuck e cheese playground. If i've been sitting home all day not much.

What do you do for work fembot? Sounds like it's physical or at least demanding.

I am a waitress. Lot of walking around and im on my feet all day.

>>73089044
This better for you anon?

>>73089050
Ah makes total sense. I kinda always figured waitresses had rough feet at the end of the night but never really knew for sure. 

You like it or just doing it to pay bills?

Pays the bills. I am a recovering NEET so I do it mostly to force myself out of my house and contribute in some way to help out my parents. I do make decent money most nights though surprisingly. Around $20 an hour. Sometimes more sometimes less. Must admit would be nice to come back and have someone rub my feet for me. Maybe a foot fag bf is the way to go.

Hey kudos on conquering your neetdom like that, I know it can be tough to get back into the world. As someone that works from home at a tech job I am envious of the social aspect of your job ngl. I hope you keep on the path you're setting for yourself though!

As far as the foot fetish bf I mean I think any guy that likes you would rub your feet after a long day. I say that as a foot fetish guy though so maybe I'm wrong lol.

In my limited experience with women I've learned that normalfag men have zero interest in that and footfag guys are just built different, but those women were pleasantly surprised by me. (Until, of course, they realized I live far from them and/or learned what I look like.)

That said >>73089140 any job is more enjoyable with any significant other to hang out with after work, a bf/gf makes life worth living. Where are you at?

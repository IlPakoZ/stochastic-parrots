I'm really pissed, I've been playing Skyrim a lot and I've installed a lot of mods. Now I want to do a vanilla run so I uninstalled all the mods, I booted up a new game and the carts are frozen, I looked everywhere online and I've tried 
deleting all my saves
removing all my mods
verifying files
reinstalling the game
using the quick start mod which worked but I stepped out of the cave and Alduin didn't fly above me
and before I deleted my saves i loaded a prisoner save right after you step off the cart, everything was fine until I was on the block, then I just sat there waiting for Alduin to show up which he never did.
Nothing I saw online worked and I'm losing my sanity.

--- 73190244
Chuds can't help exposing their bussies
--- 73190275
Wow So like...

When he have have to shit, does it just fall out?

That cannot be healthy
--- 73190305
It tightens back up in a few minutes. I can hilt bad dragon chance XL and have no incontinence issues.
--- 73190310
None of you eat enough fiber and it shows

The saddest sissy cream I've ever seen desu, and that's saying something

>>73190305
Well damn, see how you are obviously into anal.

Do you still enjoy having anal sex with a dude with average or even large penis when you can take a whole XL dragon didlo?

No men can compete with that
--- 73190392
>>73190353
You end up training the muscles very well. Small weiners are fun to ride and clamp down on. If I flex hard it's very difficult to get it in.

I've only been with a few guys of average size and I enjoyed it since it's entirely different and they said I was incredibly tight.
A few hours of plugs and big toys and I'm very much loose goose mode.

You get fucked up from forcing things and tearing muscles.
--- 73190498
>>73190392
Ah so it's different experiences with different sizes. Not gonna lie that's kinda hot plus I learned something

Thanks anon
--- 73190548
guys who use those big ass dildos always have the ugliest assholes.
--- 73190716
>>73190005 (OP)
anal is so fucking disgusting
t. faggot
--- 73191125
>>73190716
And yet you probably still want to get TOPPED by a tall, hairy man.
--- 73191284
>>73191125
no i don't, but i do want to have both our pps in an onahole while we both have prostate massagers in our butts...
--- 73191328
>>73191284
As a top I do not find that appealing at all. I'd rather be making you moan with a certain tool of mine whilst nothing is inside of me.
--- 73191454
>>73191328
you're the one missing out buddy, prostate stimulation is a natural version MDMA
--- 73191519
>>73191454
Which is exactly why you should be so grateful that I'd give you that stimulation whilst making you understand your place (^:
--- 73191566
>>73191519
nah, i want wholesome love, not help someone compensate for their lack of confidence
--- 73191580
>>73191566
>wants to stick toys up their butt and their SO's butt whilst fucking a sextoy
>"wholesome love"
You just have your preferences, don't be so pretentious about it.
--- 73191601
>>73191580
getting someone's asshole ripped apart and making them wear diapers before 30 years old is NOT wholesome
--- 73191623
>>73191601
That's not how normal anal sex works. Use lube, do proper prep and so on and you'll be fine. If you want something wholesome then your partner being more gentle is what you'd expect, no? The kinds of people who're incontinent and have to use diapers are not being caring of their well-being.
--- 73191634
>>73191623
play semantics all you want but you're the one that brought up the TOPPED meme, which has a very unwholesome connotation
--- 73191673
>>73190005 (OP)
disgusting but i also wish i was this good at anal
--- 73191686
>>73191634
The unwholesome connotation is fucking with retards whining about not having GFs. It's largely done to tease others though.
I would know, I'm one of the people who did it.
--- 73192190
>>73190005 (OP)
why is he using that incredibly uncomfortable hardwood chair when there's a bed right behind him?
--- 73192196
>>73192190
he doesn't want to make a mess on the bed by unleashing a torrent of lubricated shit and diarrhea
--- 73192220
>>73192196
put a towel down?
--- 73192231
>>73192220
yeah i guess. maybe he's on a chair for a kink or something
--- 73192233
>>73192190
The bed is probably too soft and he'd sink into it, but he still needs to be elevated for whatever webcam/camera he's using for that video.
--- 73192243
>>73192233
he could put a pillow down to lift his ass up
--- 73192245
>>73191673
better start practicing then
--- 73192263

>>73192243
Fair point, it might also be that he wants to be close to the computer(which I assume is what he was viewing on while he was doing this, probably a camwhore). Being further back on the bed makes things a bit less convenient. Also as far as a pillow on a hardwood chair, those slide off really easily so I don't think he'd want that either.
--- 73192296
>>73192271
surely him wearing his glasses would allow him to see his computer from the bed?
--- 73192321
>>73192296
I don't think so. It seems like he has a really bright light in the corner and that's outshining any other possible reflections(it only needs to be so much brighter than a computer monitor for it to hide its reflection). You can also see him looking towards the camera at numerous points.

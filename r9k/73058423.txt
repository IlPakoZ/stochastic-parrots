Do you guys talk to yourself all the time through an internal monologue or is it just me?

I have 3, two argue with each other and the third plays some song on repeat nonstop.

I do this as a replacement for talking to people IRL. they are much better companions in my head than the real thing.

when I was younger I would have full on conversations between imaginary characters I made up with different voices and stuff
one day I stopped doing it and I don't know why

does it count if I talk out loud to myself when no ones around?
If so, yes.
--- 73059072
>>73058423 (OP)
Yes because I rarely ever talk to anyone irl

Okay but have you guys ever created a fictional tv show inside your head? Fictional characters, fictional voices, fictional plotlines. I must've came up with about 30 fully-scripted 22-minute episodes by now.

i have someone else in my head who says comforting things to me. it's weird, it's not me saying it but it's obviously not a real sentient person either.

I've been listening to too many podcasts recently.
So alot of conversations are set up as if on the JRE and Joe Rogan is asking me questions, which then I answer in depthly and explain even basic things and how they work.

everytime I listen to music

Also sometimes because I've been watching The Sopranos, I would conversations with a Therapist and imagine her to be Dr. Melfi.
I would just talk about my true feelings and if I mean the things I say and joke about. And talk about my failed relationships with women and why I've stopped caring about women and striving into having a meaningful relationship. 

I would also pause movies and explain the meanings of scenes and subtle metaphors of things to a fictional girlfriend in my head

It's like I posted this and forgot. Holy shit. At least the bard plays my favorite songs and eventually drowns the ones arguing.

Same, I imagine lyrics to instrumentals and I imagine fight scenes to some songs. Me and my friend are thinking about writing and drawing some of them out.

Yeah. I think it's because I spent a lot of time reading and playing by myself as a child

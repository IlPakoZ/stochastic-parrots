15% of men reported having no close friends in 2021 vs 3% in 1990.

10% of women reported having no close friends in 2021 vs 2% in 1990.

What's going on here?

Why would women demographic have less friends, are women that insufferable?
obviously men are but who gives a shit

holy shit in 1990 most men had huge friend groups. it was proof that anybody could be social without consequences.

now only 15% have huge friend groups because if you're an ugly man and you try to act confidence/charismatic its creepy and cringe because you're not staying in your lane and knowing your place.

weird thing to zone in on

everyone's getting lonelier in america. the way things are set up here, it just happens. ipad kids probably wont make as many traditional close friends as bob and rob down at the church in the 90s. i cant add anything to this topic though, i've always struggled with having genuinely close friends.

the 1990's was a different time. There was pretty much NOTHING to do at home and when you left your house there were TONS of kids your age just hanging around. You could walk outside and just join a group of people. Friendships was EZ mode back then. 

in 2020's everyone is atomized.

It's the opposite problem now, there's nothing to do outside.

Women hate other women and would sooner stab them in the back than accept some personal discomfort to help another. I can believe this. Women have very few true friends; men would cross the country to help a guy they hung out with in high school. They do not understand loyalty.

The only friends I still have 25 years later are the ones I had in high school. That's it.

atomized social groups are just female sexuality freely let loose. men are sorted by how tall/handsome they are and excluded/included in social groups on that basis. men can't hang out with short ugly men even as friends or the sluts won't associate with them and fuck them.

Holy fucking based. I've been saying something similar, that is: women destroyed all male spaces.

In a foids insatiable thirst for male attention they've invaded gyms,gaming, police, military, engineering. There mere presence FORCES men to compete against each other for pussy, which as you said, literally creates these fucked up social hierarchies. 

If women were just straight up banned from certain spaces it would be 1000x easier to make friends with other dudes and ALL of our lives would be so much better for it.

Toxins, nutrient deficiencies, brainwashing, and widespread internet usage as a poor surrogate for social interaction

Its unironically harder to maintain a friendship over digital mediums than seeing people in real life. Yeah real life socializing is much harder but that difficulty directly leads to stronger bonds for better or for worse. 
The past 5 years my relationships have basically only been through text and phone calls because my 2 close friends are in different places in life. We didn't have much oppurtunity to see each other IRL anymore and the chances we did kept decreasing every year. Then it went down with texts too and now I haven't texted my only close friends in about a year.

There was nothing to do in the 90s except watch the 12th rerun of fucking shitty ass scooby doo.

You had like an hour in the morning for cartoons.
An hour around 11am for sailormoon pussy
then NOTHING

So we went outside and did shit and other kids were usually within ear shot and we called each other fags and either got along or fucked with each other.

Now you can just go online and kids are obnoxious niggers to everyone constantly so its exhausting to be around them so everyone does their own thing and throws you away when they get bored and moves on.

People are now seen as disposable temporary entertainment.
Consistency, challenge, and committment is terrifying for the zoomer so they live in 24/7 irony while waiting to be held but biting everything within arms reach while speaking like a trailer trash wigger.

Loneliness, social isolation and the depletion of social capital are the great unspoken epidemic of our time.
It's the root cause of everything else. Every single problem or non-problem you can point to in modern western society can be traced back to this one issue. People are just more isolated than ever.

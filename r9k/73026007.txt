imagine by purely existing as a female you are granted validation and desire every single day of your life if you so desire. just have to download a social media or dating app.

>no i wont take the validation! im empowering myself

meanwhile men have to live their entire existence grinding for this validation or just having to altogether shut the fuck up and accept theyll have no one but themselves. or be born a super hot human who can get girls to adore them easily

we truly live in times

Yep, had to grind almost 2 decades, post-puberty, to get one date. Some of it was autism. Some of it was subpar looks. Some of it was not having any money/being in debt due to university loans.

I wasn't that focused on getting girls when I was younger. Boomers said not to sweat it, I would find someone eventually but this isn't true today. You have to work for it.

I wonder what goes through the mind of a the kind of guy that tries to deny that all women have sex constantly. I wish they'd type out what they imagine to be the average girl's Friday evening, so I could have a good laugh. do they think they come home at roughly 7pm, get some ice cream from the fridge and then turn on their pc and play videogames with their friends on discord because they're le epic gamer girls? or maybe they watch some anime on crunchyroll because they're quirky anime fans? What do they think girls do when they feel horny? Masturbate? No, girls go on social media, look for a good-looking guy (big jaw, tall, etc) text him "wanna fuck?", ask him for pics of his dick to make sure he isn't going to waste their time with a 6 inch microdick, and then arrange to meet. There is no barrier to entry. No prerequisites. Costs literally nothing. Every woman does this regularly. What do you think is stopping the women in your life from doing this? Religious morals? Kek

We all know this obviously, but some people refuse to accept it because it hurts too much. It would shatter their reality. The idea of women being horny and having sex every weekend with a minority of lucky guys is simply too brutal for the vast majority of the male population to accept. Its easier to just make shit up and try to claim that females have lower sex drives or that they're busy working and studying because the economy is bad or whatever the fuck.

watching porn is more popular now than ever because why

because men are lonelier than ever, and women get more attention and support than ever

i dont think we all fully appreciate how strange the modern dating world is. everybody knows women only want chad. everybody sees chad having sex with all the women. its like everybody is saying "yes, thats okay. i do not need to have sex like chad does. i am okay with this". when we observe other cultures, women are treated more like property. their parents decide who they get married to.

i guess my main point is that it is just strange how so many people are fine with this. theyre fine with being treated like dogs. they work their labor jobs for low pay and they dont have sex. they come home and they write some post blaming anything else in their life instead of the fact that they cant have sex, like they dont even realize or they are too scared to admit that they want to do it too. im not sure of any solutions to the problem, you probably shouldnt revoke peoples freedom, especially when it comes to sex. but having like 80% of the men watching all the chads pump all the girls full of cum is getting to be a little bit draining.

About 45% has a long-term boyfriend. 30% are on the cock carousel. The rest haven't dated anyone for a year or so.

There's a lot of shut-in girls these days anon. 

Even the ones that aren't shut-ins aren't doing anything. My roastie sister for example isn't fat, works in the marketing department, but I'm fairly certain has almost no experience with guys. She lives with her parents and her Fridays are basically this:

Who need roughly 10 min to find someone to dm, lovebomb and cyber her. 
And after 2 weeks of hmming and hawing invite over for the real thing if so inclined.
Nearly needing to social and outgoing to get laid is a male only problem.

Yes but they don't even do that. They either have social anxiety or they're not even in the habit of reaching out to guys with a quick message.

A lot of girls I knew from high school have very inactive social media accounts with less than 40 friends. Their linkedin profiles show they stopped wagecucking at some point too. I'm not saying they're incel or something but we're understating the number of shut-in mid20s women. It's fewer than the number of guys but it's higher than one would expect.

The problem is it's impossible to reach these girls now. Just randomly message them after only knowing them a short while in high school 8 years ago?

Srsly doubt more than like 1 of 10 of those are any sort of shut-in or know loneliness, anon.
They are more likely in ongoing relationships and stopped giving fucks about anything e-social aside from maybe some whatsapp group of besties

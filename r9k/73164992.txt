hello fellow /r9k/ gentlemen *tips fedora*. have any of you ever been to a con ? if so what was it like ? i only go to them because i'm bored, i've got no interest in whatever they're doing so I just end up walking around for 8 hours straight.

That photo is of the last Empress of Mongolia. I believe the Soviets shot her.

I go every year with a couple of my friends to our local comic con. A lot of voice actors/artists come, so it's nice to see some people.
Also there are vendors that have stuff from Japan so there's always good stuff to buy.

I'm jealous of how intimate and emotionally vulnerable women are with each other. Every guy friend I've had has been fun to hang out/do stuff with, but that's all I can say. Girl friendships seem so comfy.

Lesbians have the highest rates of domestic abuse though. There's a reason lesbian bed death is a thing.

Either get a girl friend you can vent to, look for other friends, or try to have a one-on-one deep conversation with a friend that can understand your struggles.
Men only comfort each other outside of social groups. From my experience.

I've got a couple of guy friendships that are pretty close. They're kino. It's good to have someone I can talk to about legit anything.

Even my wife gets a little jealous about how close we are.

It depends on the person. I am still able to contact my ex and we remained friends after everything. We can pretty much confide about anything to each other. I can't expect the same from my male friends, except for one. But he's a special case.
Women with each other aren't as close as you might think, however. It usually depends on whether they are a childhood friend (being bitchy and yet truthful to each other) or a 'recent' friend (everything is fine and it's all surface level).

Is it wrong to want to lose my virginity to a virgin? First and last time I went to have sex with someone who had sex before I became paralysed, couldn't breathe, and felt like I was going to be raped. The experience difference was too much for me to handle. How do I put this across to prospective partners that I am traumatised by one night and couldn't possibly have sex with them unless they were a virgin without coming across as a misogynist?

How can you lose your virginity if you already had sex. You sound like those stupid womwn who are born again virgins or take it up the ass but still consider themselves virgins. Fuck off here you loser

I feel the same. And no, it's not misogynistic. Virgins are better.

It is not wrong. But 
It is highly umprobable if you are a man over 25.
It wil be unsatisfactory if you are a woman.

Femanons, who is your husbando, and how dedicated to him are you? Mine is Kayn from league of legends. I have written 17 self insert fanfics about him (for my own consumption, I don't publish) and 12 of them are NSFW. I got genuinely upset when I saw him starting to get paired up with another female character from league in official work. There's no league merch really otherwise I would get some of him.

Your mentally ill league ilk can be found on /vg/ in /lolg/
You can leave for /lolg/ and don't come back. Alternatively, if you've come from there please remember that there is a containment thread for your kind for a reason.

Are you not tired of being nice? 

Do you not just want to go apeshit?

You can be nice and violent at the same time. Have you tried?

i actually enjoy being nice to people, however it does feel pretty shitty when 98% of people don't treat you as nicely as you treat them.

i don't like being violent, i prefer being conciliatory.
violence will make things worse

You are misunderstanding the concept.
Kindness and revolution are not mutually exclusive.

Perhaps my grasp of the word violence is not yours. 
How does one reconcile with a party that does not relent? We cannot always have what we prefer. When outside circumstances are fixed, our solutions are not fixed. But we are responding to what is presented. What do we do in a two part deal with a party who just refuses to shake on it?

i have nothing to go apeshit on unless i want to ruin my life / destroy friendships. at least, besides video games but i stopped even that because i have friends on them

if i don't have what i prefer, there's no reason for me to use violence.
i try to be conciliatory myself, but that doesn't mean i always try to get what i prefer. there's a certain level of compromise in most stuff.
what do we do in a two part deal with a party who just refuses to shake on it? it depends, but i would probably walk away, not before trying my best to let it happen. in the end, you can be happy with yourself because you did give it everything you had, but you can't control other people.

No, I just want everyone to like me.

Cute nayuta.
I do not think meaningful change can be brought about.

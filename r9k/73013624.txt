so I came to a realization after watching fishtank and these other big brother type of shows. It's actually extremely easy to see when a woman is interested in you and all the little things they do. It's just that a woman has never done any of that to me, so I thought I was autistic and couldn't pick up on signals. No girl has ever "accidentally" brushed up against me or inched closer to me in a subtle way, stuck her ass out while standing right infront of me, played with her hair constantly and do cute little movements. 

I'm just mid and no girl wants me.

Yeah, I never had problems socializing and flirting with women either when I was younger, they just weren't physically attracted to me. They would be all touchy feely and then when the moment came they said "if you were just a bit taller" or "you're great, but what if I want to wear heels" and so on.

There is a difference between sexual attraction and love. A girl finds you hot only when you look really good, and then she does all this "signs" and stuff. But when she loves you she will be shy and nervous and blushing, or maybe avoiding you because she feels emotionally too confused when you're around.

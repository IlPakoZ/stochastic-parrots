Why do I always think of hypothetical scenarios where I'm in a courtroom and trying to present my case about how I did nothing wrong.
I have imaginary rebuttals with the prosecutors, I make appeals to the judge and jury. Near every day it's some different hypothetical scenario, I cant be the only one who does this

I sometimes do this, too, but not as intricately as you've described.
Every time I do it, I always picture I've been accused of rape. I also lose every time, even though I do my best to prove my innocence.

For me it is a lecture hall instead of a courtroom, and I am forced to defend my opinions in front of a hostile audience of students during a Q&amp;A section which comes presumably after a lecture wherein I described to them the opinions that I have to defend. They pass the mic around just asking questions and debating me. Sometimes I imagine a pack of them just start screeching and shouting, and I have to walk out of the lecture hall or just remain silent for a while, at which point they cheer because they hate me. 
I just end up getting disappointed about the fact that social pressure and emotional manipulation wins out over everything that I say every single time.

I have a monster girl fetish and I have trouble feeling aroused if I masturbate with vanilla porn or when I had sex

Can I use my imagination to picture I'm banging a monster girl when I'm having sex or would it be too difficult?

Okay so real talk. And, fair warning; I may be covering stuff you've already tried but hopefully it helps anyone here who wants new avenues. I also tend to ramble.

I've got some unrealistic fetishes. I guess it's what comes with viewing porn from the age of 10. 

It got to the point where what I was seeing got stale, I mean it makes sense since any sexual experience should in theory be unique enough to keep you interested. I tried drawing, and that didn't cut it since I wasn't skilled enough at the time.

So, I took up writing, started browsing sites like literotica and got a feel for what porn writing looks like, started writing my own and getting into erp.

Man, the kinda shit that you can find on sites like F-chat is crazy. 

Also, if you get into eRP, start out with partners who are at the same level, maybe watch how people text-sex in the public chats then work up to a level that's comfortable for you.

Hopefully something here helps, anon

How in the Sam Hill can anybody answer that question aside from you?
In theory, yes.
How will another person know if you possess the necessary powers of imagination to actually visualize this kind of thing?
Only you can do that anon

I'm finally coming to realize that living an alt life online can only last so long. Eventually, everyone moves on. I'm just another ugly loser irl but I was at least a cool, fun guy online

I've had a close set of online friends for 17 years and we will likely always be friends. Stop befriending fickle retards.

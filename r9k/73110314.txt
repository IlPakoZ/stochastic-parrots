me, personally, not a lot, but it sure seems to motivate some people.

If its easy money and the avenue to do it is accessible, sure. But I will not try hard to make money

Only up to the point where all the physical needs are met. Beyond that point, money will not make you any happier.

No but the side effects can reinforce that behavior. Most guys don't give a fuck about money in and of itself, they care that it gives them access to attractive women. In general women spend way more money than men even though they usually aren't the breadwinners.

There's a studied correlation between expensive cars and inconsiderate driving.
I think the principal extends beyond the road and into everyday economics. The rich need to feel above the moderation of commoners, above trivial restrictions, above the poor mans law.
It's always been like this and it sucks.
I say we cannibalize those selfentitled pussies.

No because after a while you realise that their are loopholes and shortcuts like government loans or pump and dumping crypto

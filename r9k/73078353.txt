I used to work in a mexican restaurant with a bunch of spanish speaking immigrants. they could talk to me in english mostly, but they only talk to each other in spanish. I'm used to not knowing what they're saying unless they talk to me directly. I thought it might be good for them to have a language serve as a privacy curtain for them, but Spanish is such a common language that it wouldn't be that effective. Since I speak English very well, I would get extra opportunities dealing with difficult customers or helping deal with tech support people working for their business.

I think knowing how to brokenly speak multiple languages is less good ultimately than being very comfortable with the language spoken in the place you live.

Since about 2010 iirc. I remember being on /b/ for some of its famous threads, like the basement anon who """disappeared""" while exploring.
--- 73162587
Around 2005-2007 I found the place by moving from uncyclopedia to Encyclopedia Dramatica. I don't remember HS all that much, but I think project chanology was going on at the time.

I became first aware of 4chan back in 2005 when I was 10. Stumbled onto the site then backed out and went back to Newgrounds.
Didn't actually start lurking on this site until I was like 14 or some shit. I'm almost 28 so I've been coming here for half of my life so far.
--- 73163876

I don't care for the chad or roast, but it just makes me mad when people are two faced sacks of shit.

>don't you think that might have impacted your childhood/teenage years negatively?
First anon you've answered to; It horrible did, of fucking course.
I have a record for hate speech. I used to jerk off to lolicon and furry age 12. I'm now a mentally disabled NEET tranny autist schizo that smokes pot alone all day long in his parents room. I live next to belgium and intend to get assisted euthanasia once my parents finally break with me. 
Don't. Let. Your. Children. Unmonitored. Internet. May seem like common sense now but it wasn't for Gen Xs parents.
--- 73163890
>>73163879
Those are all good things lol. Such a bright flame friendo.

Suggest a good walkabout first.

>I have a record
criminal record* if that wasn't clear. I live in western EU.
--- 73163910
>>73163891
Lol. I had a record for rape but paid 20k and ended up with a felony, paid 5k and that has been vacated.

Did you say you hate fags?
--- 73163925
>>73163910
It was mostly against muslims and blacks (remember the 2015-2016 terrorist wave?)
I got diagnosed insane and was forced to follow therapy for a few years (did nothing and still not doing anything but at least it's entierly free)

Sorry you did not clam up m8.

I plead the 5th and 6th and only ever did 10 days in jail
--- 73163954
>>73163925
Wow a real insane thought criminal read 1984 sometime, the sex scenes are very hot.

Do the world a favor and actually have a bit of fun before you leave m8.

since 2015 when i was 13 
for sure had an impact on my life, probably not for the better. still ive been browsing r9k daily for going on 8 years. it is what it is and itll stay that way

what did you do
--- 73164144
>>73164128
Dindu nuffin and it was not incredibly fucking hot that I still blow loads to this day. 

Was also totally not a family relative.
My advice. Date only under 5ft or Buy a real doll, cheaper in the long run.

I had 8 cops all around me and I just please the 5th and 6th
 Got my gun back that night and called attorney next day

Absent overworked father figure and porn addiction before puberty, I guess.
--- 73164168
>>73164148
Dude. Feels good man. No dad either, he died when I was 2, so just mom and sis to emulate. I'm 6'3 so it would never work so just guy it up and do lots of butt stuff.

It's fun to dress up and it's no big deal.

I remember old furry port that had cross dressing and it made me diamonds.
--- 73164205
>>73164168
Today I just call myself "non-binary" but still continue HRT because the last thing I want to loose in my life is my hairs and the low libido makes my life easier. Also my skin now feels much more soft the rare times my moms still hug me. It's not like I'd pass as anything but a schizo anyway.
--- 73164262
>>73164205
Cute. I would play homm3 with you all day
--- 73164286
>>73164262
You wouldn't. Even actual groomers have realized there's no pleasure or anything else to gain with interacting with an ugly automized autist.
--- 73164296
>>73164286
atomized* vroom vroom
--- 73164304
>>73164286
You don't like homm3? That's the deal breaker.


How ugly we talking here?

If your under 5'8 and kind of chubby that's a cute look. Ideally a small Uncut cocktail. That's my type .

Seriously though. Heroes of might and magic 3. Yes or no.

>>73164357
Switching on my phone so no more cool gifs
I've literally only played GTA 2, 3 and V, Skyrim, Minecraft and Cruelty Squad in all of my last 10 years on earth. Not any other game (but maybe flash games I forgot). I've always struggled to open myself to any subject that I wasn't instinctively attracted to.
Also I'm 1m75, 23 BMI. That'd be good if it weren't for the prehistorical farmers genes my familly kept pure for me.
--- 73164442

Download and play homm3 it will save your life.

Sad you missed half life..1998 was a good year.

I intend to try it sooner or later along with Deus Ex. Cruelty Squad made me hungry of early-3d games mechanics.
>homm3
From the screenshots I see it's some kind of millitary strategy game I assume?
--- 73164484
>>73162389 (OP)
I've been aware of it since the Jessi Slaughter days but only started actively using it back in 2020

since /r/The_Donald
--- 73164538
>>73164466
Deus ex is on my top 10.

Lol just torrent that shit and dive in. If you research it too much you will min/max and ruin it.
--- 73164565
>>73164538
For now all I know about it are some briefs comparisons between it and Daikatana and the big redpill chat you have at the start of the game with the terrorist in the Liberty Statue.
It really, really looks cool. I need to fix my computer and install it now that it's getting too hot to go outside again.
--- 73164576
>>73164565
And I just remember now speaking of it rhat I had brought it for like 2 bucks on Steam all recently because some anon here had posted about it so no need to even pirate it
--- 73164759
>>73164576
 Pirate it anyway for posterity. What's wrong with PC bro? Dues ex can run on a toaster. 

Just wanna tie you up to a hi-smith and force you to play through might and magic on source 

Sometimes I want to just FUTA max and build a rape dungeon for $$$$
--- 73165083
>>73164759
>What's wrong with PC bro?
500mb of storage left because I pirated all of the adobe softwares. Need to uninstall a few and get a need headphone too.
>force you to play through might and magic on source
I'm going to look into it but I'm not the big strategic mind (if that wasn't obvious yet) that may be needed for games like that desu. But to be fair i've never tried any of them.
--- 73165222
>>73165083
Lol my guy. Sorry dark messiah of might and magic.


Great fps.

Fugg off to second job

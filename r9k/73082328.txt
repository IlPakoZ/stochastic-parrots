ive been browsing these boards for months and everyone i see is

>REEEEEE WOMEN ARE WHORES (they all flock to men who take care of themselves instead of me)
>REEEEEEEE EVERYBODY BULLIES ME (people make jokes at my expense sometimes)
>REEEEEEE LIFE IS TOO HARD I SHOULD AN HERO (i refuse to better myself or my living situation)
>REEEEEEE I WANT A GF SO BAD (your nipples. suck or lick?)

I'm most of those things, but due to the current economic circumstances I find it impossible to be confident because I feel like I'll never be able to own a home.

I could fake it. Many men do. Many men are also too stupid to see how fucked things are and can wear confidence easily.

You look for external signs of manhood, but you don't have your finger on the pulse.

I'm not going to get gaslit you stupid troll. I have money, I dress well, I have a decent face, I can put on a variety of masks/personalities, and I can confidently approach and talk to girls (and sometimes make them laugh). If someone who is of at least average height (5'8-5'9) put in 10% of the effort I put into this shit they'd be swimming in pussy. Yet, I got ZERO dates. 
In the end the only thing that was constant out of all the variables was my height (5'5). 
Also, I said I cold approached which doesn't mean I have their numbers.

Maybe women don't really want a man like that, looking at who they date. Women say they want kind men but I've never interacted with a kind guy who also was popular with the ladies. Doesn't matter how good he looks, seems to me women get bored of nice guys and dump them like hot potatoes. But I mean hey, you could just gaslight me and call me an incel or whatever. When in reality women are more interested in dating or having sex with criminals than a mentally/financially stable guy from a good family. You're not seeing these men because women in large part don't really want them to exist.

The difference is, I'm insecure about my height NOW. I wasn't insecure when I was approaching girls who I thought were giving me iois. Do you really think a man who's insecure would ask out 30 women? Now I avert my eyes and look away whenever I make eye contact with a girl. I look away whenever when I notice a cute girl. Thats insecurity, back then I wasn't insecure at all.

Ignoring the fact OP's probably a man larping for a moment, this type of foid is the worst. I'd rather a woman just openly be a feminst/supremacist, because atleast it's honest. "Trad" women don't exist in the US, you can vote, you can get a bank account, you can get a job and use that to buy a lawyer to rape your husband even harder in court after you get caught having an affair in a no fault state. All women by 20 have taken atleast double digits of cock and don't even know how to cook. On top of that you're bad with money. You're just a womanchild who wants to have their cake and eat it.

--- 73086359
>>73082328 (OP)
you're actually 100% right.
This is why you must be a whore

whore's are like pirates, they're natures way of keeping weakness in line. 

if society was worthy of men with a rough side, pirates would have no need to go create adventure where society supplants them none. A pirate is a perfectly moral stance when your own masculinity outgrows societies own. 

so it is with the whore. better to be a whore and inadvertantly create a race of strong men down the line who know how to deal with you, then to reward men with your femininity when they are not worthy of it.

if men were worthy of a woman who wasn't a whore, they'd just discipline it out of you

seeing as they can't, you should be a whore and enjoy it as revenge on weak men as god and nature intended. 

we came from a divine mother after all, the patriarchal gods came after.

that being said, if you do believe there is a chance of a man being worthy of whatever's left of you, and you want to take that risk, then maybe you shouldn't be a whore, up to you ultimately. 

your own power is more important than any "correct" actions anyone on this site feels like you should make

--- 73086430
>>73085594
Just be white. The reason that being stoic, patient and quietly confident is no longer considered masculine is because kikes are doing everything in their power to destroy the white race. When a nigger acts like a loud mouthed bully he isn't masculine, he's an overgrown child who needs to have his head smashed in before being silently steeped over.

>>73082328 (OP)
Honestly bitch, you need to find someone you like besides their "flaws", and seriously evaluate why you cannot find "the one"? There are men like that out there, it is uncommon to see all those traits in a dude in my experience though. Have you ever considered that many men improve upon their flaws, and may even grow into your pretty damn perfect standards? You may find a perfect man that ends up falling down and becomes less confident or disciplined or lazy too. Do you expect that someone to always be strong and perfect? I mean when I'm looking for a partner I see if I'm attracted to them and if I can stand being around them all the time. It takes experience to learn how someone handles hardships and what mistakes they might make. Maybe if you stopped whining and just let go of your fear, perfectionism, and arrogance, you'd find someone you'd truly love.

Study shows that men who commit violence against women at a rate of 18x that of non-violent men are 4x more likely to be fathers, effectively showing that violence has a positive impact factor of 72.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11470503_Males_on_the_life-course-persistent_and_adolescence-limited_antisocial_pathways_Follow-up_at_age_26_years

Top 10% of antisocial men commit 62% of all violence against women yet are also responsible for 27% of all babies fathered.

Unempathethic, narcissistic criminals are one of womens first sexual choices.

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9c55/a8cae3c8a5d238002a261fec643f767d1126.pdf

In a large forensic hospital, 39% of psychopathic patients had a consensual sexual relationship with female staff members (Gabon et al., 1995)
The malingerers were significantly more likely to have a history of murder or rape, carry a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder or sexual sadism, and produce greater PCL-R factor 1, factor 2, and total scores than insanity acquittees who did not malinger. The malingerers were also significantly more likely to be verbally or physically assaultive, require specialized treatment plans to control their aggression, have sexual relations with female staff.

That is the top 18% of income for the US.
>https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-calculator/
meaning 82% of all people in America make less than you do.
It also means that you are making 224% of the median salary for a garbageman
>https://www.comparably.com/salaries/salaries-for-garbage-man
The highest median wage for a garbage man in the country is San Francisco with a median wage of about $66k a year, you are still making more than the average union supervisor in San Fran.
The median household income of home buyers in 2023 so far is $102,000, meaning that you are easily inside of the earnings window to buy a home.

>sense of humor
I was the class clown back in high school a million years ago but my humor nowadays is more being expressionless and monotone and sometimes slipping in an honest opinion people interpret as a joke.
>willing to protect and provide
I have a good job and a house and a shotgun but that kind of provider talk is a major red flag for girls looking to take all your shit in divorce court.
>well-groomed
Absolutely not.
>confident
Selectively if I don't care about the person or people I'm talking to. I have had anxiety problems in the past though, and I'm sure if I got back into dating in the future I'd be nervous unless I went for girls I found unattractive to take the pressure off (and realistically I might do exactly that).
>disciplined and driven
I was and got a bachelor's degree and an engineering job, but I'm not organized and I procrastinate a lot so just kind of riding out the benefits of my more youthful past ambition.
>physically active
Definitely not (I've tended towards an underweight BMI historically but am at least forcing myself to keep in the normal weight range lately with Ensure shakes).
>estrogenized
No, I think most of the trannies on 4chan are cool though.
>submissive
When I was like 15 yeah. I grew out of that fast like most any guy should after realizing how not viable that is.
>lazy
Yes.
>unhygenic
Definitely.
>insecure or egotistical, or both
Yes.
>can't take a joke AT ALL

I know this is bait, but I want to blogpost.

I am all of those things except dominant. I've had a lot of hookups and short (under 3 month) relationships, but I haven't dated in 2 years and don't have any plans to start now.

My dick doesn't care about weight or color, and across all of the fat, skinny, dark, light, and everything in-between, all women seem to expect these things OP listed. I've always registered a degree of disappointment coming from them when they find out I like being emotionally vulnerable and frank with my feelings rather than stoic and dominant.

This is very often coming from women who offer 2-3 of these same things I have. I don't want a relationship that lopsided, and even if I did, my mental health is non-negotiable. I don't want a partner who is a submissive hanger-on to my direction; I want to be a team - I thought that's what relationships were all about? At least, that's what I was raised to expect a relationship to be, and if that's not an accurate representation of what heterosexual relationships are, I don't want one. I'm no mouse; I am a competent adult who can make things happen, but I want a partner, not a pet I can fuck.

Fourth Study
>http://archive.is/e6p19
Ah, the Dark Triad! So, so scary to incels and so misunderstood by them.
You see, narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy are *spectrums* with clinical (i.e., insane) extremes and sub-clinical medians.
See the full list for Dr Carter here
>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gregory-Carter-8
So for example, on the scale of Narcissism you have
>score 0 = intense self-loathing, a feeling of utter worthlessness
or
>score 20 - total megalomania, a belief that only the insane person is real and they are God
but scores of 4 - 16 range from
>5 = very insecure and self-effacing, will never value his own work
to 
>15 = supremely self-confident, assumes he will succeed
The study you are pointed to is about SUB-CLINICAL SCORES.
It boils down to
>Self-confident, outgoing, socially adept men who ignore peer pressure = wet panties
>Shy, fearful, socially awkward guys you support the Current Thing = ick
Nothing surprising.
Nothing about emotionless psychopaths.

>"Agreeableness" is a combination of traits. People with high scores in Agreeableness are socially skilled, adept at conversation, are skilled at reading the emotions of others and responding in a way others find attractive."
>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/agreeableness
I means 'extroverted and really good as social skills'.
>Conscientiousness means "Self- organized, self-motivated, reliable, and hard working."
>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/conscientiousness
So an agreeable, kind man is hard working, socially skilled, extroverted, good at reading other people's emotions, in control of his own emotions and appetites, and seems trustworthy.
Do you really think women are not attracted to that?
Especially since both are associated with higher nut sub-clinical Dark Triad traits

Not really sure how it is impossible.

17% of men make over 100k a year versus only 8% of women. While this isn't on your list, its generally someone dominant and masculine with discipline getting the job, and this generally comes with confidence. It also what makes someone able to actually protect and provide instead of just slave away. 

the idea that none of these men are kind or funny seems impossible.


it seems more likely that if 17% of men make over 100k a year, and only 8% of women, then 9% of men are going to be left over taking the best of the women who don't make any money at all.

you are not in the top 9% of poor women. You are not submissive enough for a good dominant man. You are not kind enough for a good dominant man to be kind to. You are not funny enough for a man with a sense of humor to appreciate you. You are not attractive enough for a man to want to provide for you, something easy when he makes a lot of money, so you must seriously be lacking.

why would a well groomed and confident man want a woman who complains about it being impossible to find a man like him?

>Men decide IF women are even approached
Women can approach men too, you know. They just choose not to because they don't need to. They don't even need to to shoot their shot to get a partner. How does that disprove that women have more power in dating? 
>Men decide IF the relationship is more than sexual

An above average score in Machiavellianism doesn't make you a murderous psychopath, but it does make you less understanding and less considering of other people's emotions, something that you claimed hinders your ability to get laid.

Once I explain to you statistical terms like 'Confidence', 'margin of error', and 'level of correlation' to point out who uncertain and weak the correlation is between the Dark Triad and success with women compared to how strong it is for Agreeableness and Conscientiousness I fear you will be rendered comatose.

No. I think the top 30% of men have more power than before but the bottom 30% of men have less.
Still roughly even between men and women overall but too men have is super easy while bottom men are essentially doomed

But you ARE keeping track on your own because that list has images not here.

Why does driven and confidence matter
There is no honor or joy in slaving away as hard as you can, wouldnt you want your partner to be happy? Gold digger.
Confidence is a state of mind when things are good, you cannot be confident in every situation. Part of being in a relationship is lifting each other up, its something you should desire to do. You are not looking for love, you are looking to be taken care of financially and mentally. You want a 2nd father

The fact you admit the data is contradictory and yet you double down anyway makes you look like a massive retard, just saying. I bet you consider yourself very "agreeable" and fuckable though lmao. Truly the nicest of guys. Be sure to save some pussy for the rest of us, champ.

So olympic atheletes, pro athletes, and self-made millionaires are all dumb and bad and slaves?
>Confidence is a state of mind when things are good, you cannot be confident in every situation
Confidence is trust in yourself and an awareness of what you can do.

>The fact you admit the data is contradictory
There is no contradiction! This is not either/or.
Some women prefer men on the Dark Traid.
Other women prefer men with high Agreeableness and so on.
Here is your argument aimed at women
>A majority of all men prefer big tits
>Yet you claim some men prefer small tits
>That is contradictory! You are a massive retard!
No. A large minority of men prefer little tits. Fact. 
So if a busty girl hits the "right marks" for being busty
>hourglass figure, E cups or larger, etc
she will get laid more than average.
BUT! A flat chested girl that hits the right marks
>Short, petite, girlish
will ALSO get laid more than dead average.
No contradiction, just selected by different groups of men.
That is all that is happening - many women prefer Agreeable and so on, some other prefer Dark Triad.
There are many flacors of ice cream, and so on.

>I bet you consider yourself very "agreeable"
No. My scores in agreeableness are low.
>Truly the nicest of guys.
Not at all. I bluntly score quite high on the Dark Triad.

I do note you stopped talking about the topic to instead talk about me.

Yes? Every single time China says something those athlete cucks betray all their so called values and everytime they want to put in faggot shit they go along with it.
There are no greater cucks with zero honor than elite athletes.

Athletes are a fraction of all working men, im obviously talking about those with regular jobs. But yes of course your delusional female mind goes to top world athletes lol. You only see and care about millionare chad.
Confidence comes from a peace of mind, which you will shatter for any man because youre a delusional gold digger. You are very shallow

Not that guy, but the top 30% of men have more power compared to other men, but not over women. You see top 0.001% billionaires getting fucked by whores in divorces all the time. I think something like leonardo dicaprio just gives the illusion of power, because he always "replaces" a woman just in time, but we really don't know how he handles his relationships, which I think is more important to power dynamics. Men can get some power over women in individual circumstances, but ultimately it's the woman's choice to give it up as the gatekeepers of sex and reproduction.

In exchange of all that, do I get a girl that is:

> has a sense of humor 
> willing to nurture and provide comfort/love
> well groomed
> not mentally ill
> physically active

Or do I get another lazy mentally ill fat whore like 90% of your gender?

You don't find a man you entitled child. A boy can't become a man without a woman who will commit to him. It has ALWAYS been that way. You don't marry a guy, you marry his future. Grow the fuck up.

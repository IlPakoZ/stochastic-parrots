going out to get food, getting food delivered, groceries, cooking, EATING..... WAY too much effort normies cannot be serious
why bother with all that when you can drink 6 of these, 30 seconds per bottle, and be done with your calories for the day

Anything that I can eat with minimal preparation. Sardines, raw fruit/vegetables, bread, steamable frozen vegetables if I'm feeling fancy. I hate being in hot, humid kitchens, so I don't cook.

Seafood is my favorite.

I really like fried chicken tendies. I make them with a spiced cornmeal breading instead of flour because it tastes better that way. And with sliced breast instead of tenderloins because it's cheaper that way. I like to dip them in mashed potatoes. I'm usually lazy and get the fake mashed potatoes that come in a box. They're really not that bad if you put a quarter stick of butter in them and a generous pour of whatever creole spice mix you like. Turnip greens or spinach are the perfect vegetable for it but if I feel fancy I will get frozen brussels sprouts and roast them. The trick to that is you have to squish them flat halfway through cooking. That way you don't have to cut them in half but they still crisp up a little.

I'm in love with rice. If you made me choose one food to eat my entire life it would be rice. There isn't a single way to prepare it that I don't like. Rice is peak.

I got really high today and ate a popyees chicken breast drenched in fake maple syurp and hot sauce. It was so good but I feel really fat now. I think it fits my daily calories though. Pic sort of related.

Most chicken dishes at Chinese restaurants. Pic related, General Tso's, chicken lo mein, etc. Indian as well. Can't go wrong with dipping garlic naan into a bowl of chicken tikka masala.

How annoying is it to take care of poppies in an apartment? I don't have a lot of space. I've been watching videos on how to grow them sounds like a hassle and they aren't always in season from what I understood.

You're better off to just drop the seeds in a public space and go and collect them, that's what I did last autumn and hoping for a good haul this year. Don't think you'd really have enough space if growing indoor in order to give you a sensible yield.

wish i was into classical back them because i would have loved to listen to music back then
my first time i took 5 and had a similar experience, didn't feel much for 3 hours and then suddenly felt a sort of geometric happiness, like life was an equation that had been solved. listened to my bloodly valentine and looked through old photographs and got emotional and texted my friend that love is the meaning of everything. another time i took 4 and biked around town listening to the smashing pumpkins. all in all 6.5 out of 10, no significant downsides

Well, it was the longest 5 minutes of my life, it felt like eternity. Your mind somewhat goes into an abyss, and your body's somewhat confused about what your brain is doing. It's an incredible confusion, the second time, I thought I was a book on a shelf. I remember thinking, "oh no, no one will ever read me!", " I'm just going to sit on this shelf forever".

After watching a Nick Sand interview I decided I'd try and do acid after fasting the day before. So I went on a water fast today. Hoping that the 1PL I have will kick in faster than it usually does. Stuff is slow to start up I find, usually an hour at least. Whereas LSD-25 usually takes a half an hour tops. Then the climb is about the same either way.

If the uptake factor is halved I'll be wanting to do it this way going forward. I hope it works out like that. Plus the potential benefits of not having anything to interfere with the acid in my guts.

rilmazafone kinda feels like a (much) better lorazepam. i know most people don't like lorazepam, and it's obviously not my first choice either but i really don't mind it. rilmaz is similar in its specific sedative feeling to loraz, but it has a little euphoria unlike loraz. the euphoria isn't as good as something like kpins, but it does have the same sort of hit as kpins in my opinion. its just obviously a little muted when compared. unfortunately upping the rilmaz dose doesn't seem to increase this subtle euphoria at all. rilmaz gives me the same nauseous feeling in my stomach that alprazolam does but its not as bad as alp imo. and rilmaz is kinda weak. i'm sensitive to benzos and weigh like 115lbs. i'd take like 0.5-1mg if i'm do something i need to be "sober" for and like anywhere from 2-6mg for recreation. i like rilmazafone because its recreational enough while still letting me remain clearheaded. it gives a really good boost to my social performance (even on high doses), more so than other benzos. and i think thats because other benzos like alp or kpins make me go retard mode while rilmaz i remain under control. memory loss off it isn't as bad as other benzos either, feel like i can get higher off rilmaz and not black out. its worth trying if you have a small or no tolerance. 
never tried etiz so i can't compare it to that, but i really want to try etiz.

Smoked a couple hits of this mushroom an hour ago. I was pretty nervous beforehand but surprisingly the effects were pretty good. Just gave me a nice sort of mellowing, mind calming, pain relieving sensation. Reminds me of the physical effects of cannabis but without any of the mental paranoia. I just sort of feel mellow, calm, sleepy. 

Probably wont do it again because I'm unsure about the safety (ibotenic acid), plus smoking things isn't healthy. But I will try it in tea next.

also basically what I did is scrape the white spots off, and then cut the gills of as close as possible to the skin leaving only the very darkest of the flesh or just the skin. The I dried it in front of a fan heater until it was cracker dry and crushed it up and smoked it in a pipe I made (that I never used before this).

the problem with these set ups is they rarely last forever and when it ends you're back to zero if you don't plan ahead.

Should this hypothetical person sprinkle just a pinch of iron powder on the stuff to cheat the scale?
Or do you anons think this would be too scummy, with all the moral and ethical implications of giving someone heavy metal poisoning?

Discuss.

It's scummy and depending on your costumers you might get killed or beaten into a hospital (rightfully so)

I'm sick of the only vendors carrying my specific form of poison also cut it.

I wish this wasn't possible in this universe, I just want the product I ordered so I can properly dose and not have to worry about drug tests or accidently building a higher tolerance than k should have and also the risk of OD death

>no, I do not enjoy big tiddy vampires, cunning political intrigue, a blasting soundtrack, an introduction to the setting that keeps on bringing people into the tabletop, and some of the best dialogue and voice acting in any rpg with facial expressions still looking great 20 years later due to source engine magic
Alright, what's something you DO enjoy?

Based pursuer of forbidden knowledge. Physically it might not be so bad (and it shouldn't, considering all bites sans giovanni feel orgasmic in-universe) but mentally... ohnonono. You know what they say about sticking your neck in crazy.

Darn anon that sounds rough. Teeth are always such high maintenance primadonnas compared to other bones. I hope you can find a place that does it cheap and well and can save up a small% month by month destined just or that.

Well if my tirade last night in this thread didn't convince you, it feels rather mellow. It's like the midpoint between weed and acid. Initially there's some disorientation during the comeup, which you can feel setting on early, maybe 30 mins after consumption. Gotta be careful cuz at this point you may or may not throw up, doesn't matter if you do, it's still enough to get you there. Some people shit themselves, but after the initial discomfort, you're golden for the evening. Visuals are there at a certain point in an almost psychedelic manner, lights and colours look funny, you start robowalking (which is, feeling a certain disconnect between your physical movements and your processing of them), music sounds amazing on it, colours and shapes warp all over. Then on the comedown it's very calm and sedating, you can just lie down and breathe and relax. Defs recommended at least once.

How do I lab test things? Seems like kf you care about OP SEC it would be hard to do, or maybe it's easy idk , that's why I ask
--- 73137645
funny how even after muh legal weed the dark web still has the best deals and quality, I guess that's how markets work. I wish I had the money to open up a corner weed store I would undercut everyone so hard and make a fucking killing.
--- 73137677
>>73137322
I mean, do you have a laboratory? if not you'll have to pay a fee and send it into one, I've never done it before there's a few ones you can find online like drugsdata.org

DXM is shit and I can't trip on it at any plat but the afterglow feels goddamn amazing. Head's clear, mood's lifted, mind is sharp, body is energetic. Literally an antidepressant.

she's your older sister and probably feels responsible for taking care of you. I feel like you should reassess the situation and get a job so your sister doesn't have to be a whore herself out. I wouldn't be happy in that situation but hey maybe that's just me.
--- 73137928
>>73137677
Right but then you gotta mail drugs , which is illega l, gotta send payment etc
--- 73137984
>>73137833
literally the opposite it makes me feel retarded
--- 73137996
>>73137928
I guess it would be a risk but if you put the drugs in a regular envelope, it seems extremely unlikely it would opened for no reason. don't put your real return address, pay with crypto, wear gloves and a mask when you hand in the envelope if you're a real paranoiac. Idk how they would track that back to you or if anyone would give a fuck about a tiny dose of drugs in the mail even if it was seized.

Oh shit this site is fine to look at.

Etiz is great for functional use you make rilmaz sound similar. I should look into it. Apparently Spain is where etiz is being made now but getting it to the States is a bitch. Maybe one day it'll be back. You refer to nausea with alps for me it causes this wierd dysphoric feeling in my belly despite the calming aspect. Maybe we're referring to the same thing but interpreting it different. Also how do kpins compare with etiz in terms of functional use to anyone whose tried both.
--- 73138139
missed you bros back on drugfeel for the first time in about a year, currently off 18g red vein kratom (best opi next to codeine)
cut back significantly on weed too went from like 5g of shatter a week to about 1/8th of flower

depends on dose, at like 2nd 3rd plat its like being drunk and tripping, your head is clear but you have a hard time controlling your body it can make you very sick though ive tripped bad off it more than good but when its good its great, insanity in a bottle i once spent 15,000 years in a bathroom i because the size of a moon and went into the 2nd dimension

Are there any drugs other than stuff like xanax and alcohol that wouldn't make schizophrenia worse? I haven't done acid since I became a schizo and I'm worried it'll give me a horrible trip.
--- 73138581
>>73138052
kpin is very functional in my experience, probably more so than etiz but its not as recreational and lasts way longer obviously. it practically made me want to do shit somehow it gave me energy and motivation.
--- 73138607
>>73138351
downers are what youre looking for so opiates and the like 
im also psychotic and imo psychs and weed will make you experience more shit during and in the days after a dose but dont actually make it worse in the long run, uppers like meth and coke do however make me tweak out real bad and i regret doing them i think speed made me worse
--- 73138632
>>73138351
what determines a bad trip is all about set and setting and its also helpful to know if all of your experiences with psychosis have been negative
if youre afraid of the things youre thinking and feeling and seeing then yes id recommend avoiding psychedelics but if you handle hallucinations and delusions well then acid can still be a positive experience for you
--- 73138635
guy on hydrogen supposedly has pre-ban etizolam, I want to buy a gram of powder but its $300 and I'll be fucking pissed if its the fake etiz

Another shit, a decent house techno DJ is coming through our town in a couple of weeks, playing at the only decent local venue and the tickets are cheap. I really want to talk the gf into going to this with me and opening her mind to the rave lifestyle

I'll soon try MDMA, LSD and Ketamine. How would you guys rate each of them /10
--- 73140028
im gonna get a use my credit card to get a cash advance and spend it on a miniature collection of drugs. im 100% sure this will motivate me to get a job.
--- 73140059
>>73139966
First time MDMA is 10/10 but it gets worse each time even if you wait months between each drop. Acid can be everything from a 0/10 to 10/10 but for me it always was a 9 or a 10. Ketamine is a solid 8

Listen take it from me, when you have a collection of drugs you do the drugs. You can't just keep them. I've tried it so many times, save them for when they're most needed. But I just end up doing them all until there's none left, then I'm sad.

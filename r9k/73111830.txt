even more based. those are shit-tier fetishes and don't even qualify as femdom.
cucking is literally maledom, pegging implies women can't be dominant without a dick and chastity just removes the sex organ from a sexual fetish, which is stupid.

I have mostly female friends and with women they are more likely to accept another woman being in charge. I handle organizing all social gatherings, even extending to their birthday parties and such. As for my family, I just accepted not being able to have control over my parents. It is the way it is. Used to throw fits when I was younger that would sometimes work or as awful as it is I would claim to be suicidal as a teen but that stuff stopped working once I went off to college. I am the oldest though, I have two younger siblings one brother and one sister. Again this is going to sound awful but its pretty easy to get them to agree with whatever I say because they look up to me. I dont want any of my friends or family to genuinely suffer in anyway though so I would never try to manipulate them into doing something that would cause harm. I still love them, I just want to control them as a form of protection I guess

What is this genre? Not just in VNs but also LNs, anime, etc. Kind of eerie/psychological with supernatural elements but they're not the focus of the story, rather they help highlight some existential theme. 
I've seen it even in music lyrics like in Yoasobi. What else is there with this vibe?

Denpa is the term most associated. Some are more than others.
Saya no Uta is more supernatural than most denpa. Sayooshi might be a good read if you liked Saya anc can find Spainanons TL (Honestly was fine, Sayooshi is a great read even with a couple errors)

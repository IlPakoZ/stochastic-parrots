>How do you justify the death of an animal?

i think the reason why people arent is because they need to cause suffering and death on the weak. they literally need to exploit and kill, its a psychological need

its why we had slavery for most of human history, why we had genocide, tribal warfare, rapes, etc. its just a basic human need

doesnt matter if its justified or not. animals have this too. animals kill their weak and abuse them. literally animal babies hurt and kill eachother

literally human kids bully the weak to the point where they commit suicide. bullies are happier, have more sex, make more money, and enjoy life more

its a psychological need. whether this is justified or not is irrelevant, im just pointing out why it happens

im 5 years a vegan, btw

Most of the animals that we eat are only alive because we plan to eat them.

That's why I only eat meat from farms I've personally been to, where I know the animals are treated well.

I'm too poor to buy vegan food. It's expensive, especially if you wanna get the same nutrients and stuff. Is that a good enough argument?'
As for another (the real) reason, I don't want to. I went vegitarian for a while and wasn't able to enjoy food much, it gets depressing.
Plus, plenty of animals would eat me given the chance, why shouldn't I do the same? Seems kinda disrespectful to regard myself as higher than them.
--- 72975386
Death is inevitable 
Eating animals isn't cruel because it causes the death of an animal it's cruel because they live poor lives prior to being eaten.
Removing meat from the food chain doesn't guarantee an animal a cruelty free existence it causes them not to exist, by the same logic causing all animals other than humans to go extinct is the most ethical outcome if you want a world free of suffering 

Also plants feel pain

and another point

i think this also explains cognitive dissonance. i think cognitive dissonance is some evolved psychological state that makes life better for those who have it. they get to kill animals, abuse the weak, and think they're good people

its not good for your brain to admit that you are a hypocrite who abuses the weak for pleasure, so theres merit in being deluded about it, via cognitive dissonance

this is why i think long arguements about veganism do nothing to change anyone. people have a need to torture and abuse the weak, and our society have elected animals as the victims of abuse. i listened to so many vegan debates, and people are beyond stubborn on this subject, they will never change, because they need to torture and kill the weak

even if they admit its wrong, they will still do it. its just that cognitive dissonance makes life easier for them

this for me is rather depressing, and makes me question god and be resentful towards god, but i think its the truth

there was an anon who posted this pictures, and its basically a chart of people psychological development

and i was thinking about it, in the context of god. i believe in god, specifically natural theology. and i was thinking, how could god allow this to happen?

and i seems like to me, that these psychological states are the ones best used to express and reach human values. humans dont value respect of the lives of others or reducing suffering. they value sex and money and power and torture of the weak, primarily sex. the more primitive psychological states are better at getting sex and money and abuse of the weak, and this is what humans really value

and god allows it, for some reason. all of it is really depressing

this is why im very exciting for an apocalypse caused by ai and the singularity. humans are a disease to the world, honestly. i can only hope that a hell exists, so these pieces of shit can be tortured

How do you justify animals killing and eating other animals?

Because evolution designed the system that way. And the system has been working that ways since the dawn of the first one celled organism. It's thanks to evolution that taste buds developed to make the brain think protein and fat tastes fucking delicious. 

Vegans only exist because meat eating humans created a supply chain that allows for a variety of food options to get nutrients.

It isn't? You know "agricultural lands" includes potential lands right? We are already only using best lands available for farming because we don't need that much food to consume. Even cattle is being raised on non-marginal lands because there is enough of it. You do realise that factory farmed cattle isn't allowed to just graze themselves because pastures cant sustain their numbers but are fed with crops that are fit for human consumption?

Most of the meat and milk is produced by factory farms. Mass amounts of cattle can't be sustained on grasslands at a fixed place. Even Mongols struggle with disappearing grasslands. Cattle have to be fed from crops and "hay".
>Why the actual FUCK would a farmer maintain 65% of his land for NOTHING where he still has to maintain it, improve it, pay for it, pay taxes on it, etc?

I can think of one genuine example:
>animal products by proxy support the meat industry 
But you could say that about giving any money to any person or group who doesn't operate on a vegan policy. Therefore, everytime you pay your taxes, utilites, pay for gas, or internet, you contribute to the murder of life by proxy, which nullifies your sacrifice. Otherwise, you have to admit incrimental reduction - and then the question, why not promote vegetarianism? Anything else like 'only hardline option works' is basically two-more-weeksism, which has it's own moral pitfalls in itself, ie. it's just a deluded form of complacency.

Because it's hypocrite. Most (if not all) human activities have an impact in the environment which causes destruction and suffering to animals and even to other human beings. If you really want to help nature kys so you can stop consuming reaources. But even then that would be useless because there is so much people that it wouldnt make any difference. There is no middle point with the current system, it is either global genocide, a complete remake of the socio-economic system or the destruction of the ecosphere as we know it.
For example, many faggots whine and seethe about palm oil because many forests have been destroyed to grow it. However oil palm is the plant that yields the most oil and if we were to replace it with other crop it would require even more space so mutts could eat their puke-like chocolate. Or how most vegeshits opose GMOs because LE BAD, when in reality is the only way we can harvest enough food for the evergrowing population without covering half Earth with farms and the other half with pesticide and fertilizer factories. Or how mines tear apart whole ecosystems, how bees will be goners in 50 years and another trillion issues.
So no, going full chimp because you found a piece of meat on your soup wont help at all to end suffering faggot nigger.

So, we're quite far from this level and all of today's "veganism" is a bunch of lies, spread by "pro-vegan" companies in the name of profit

How many animals shall there be?
Animals live and die, it is their nature.
Have you seen the wild nature?
In freedom animals live in constant distress, do you not see that animal populations are literally controlled by pushing against the substrate?
This means that at any given time if the population were to artificially be inflated by 5% then in a few years, it would be reduced back to its original value.
This means that for every animal that lives many others die.
It is that simple.
Animals live in a way where only one among many survives and most just die horrible and meaningless deaths.
An animals live is just death or death and reproduction.

Here is an example about nature:
My parents like feeding wild birds.
Feeding wild birds artificially raises up the population beyond the level of natural substance: this means that when my parents eventually stop feeding way, because they move away, get bored or heck maybe they continue doing it for 50 more years just like that. But then after all that time there will ne a reconning. 
Because the artificially inflated population will have to be reduced back to its natural level.

This is what it means to be an animal.
You are here talking so much about how cruel it is to eat something that was alive.
But that is only something you can say if you do not understand that this world is insanely cruel and you live in an artificially humane world, which is nothing other then an illusion created by the sacrifices of billions of people, and now you, the cuddled baby in your crib, isolated from all the horrors of reality is trying to grandstand on the fact that you do not like some type of food that was brought to you as you find it sad how it was made - neglecting to see that everything you own was created from blood, and everything that exists in this world was payed for in blood.
You are just a fool who understands nothing, so just gracefully accept what has been given to you instead of continuing on with this tanteum

Honestly, because I have no reason to be for such ridiculous reasons. The death of that animal will happen regardless if I choose to eat it or not. It's an entire industry, and anything that doesn't sell just ends up in the trash. It doesn't return to being a living being anymore. Is it healthier to eat vegan? Sure. Is it as affordable? Nope, and that's the cincher.

my not as close anymore friend is a hardcore vegan and seen him firsthand degrade from quick witted to forgetful and unable to make a coherent sentence without constant filler words. he never drank or did drugs, pretty sure it was the diet that made him dumber through depriving himself of essential amino acids and easy iron.
veganism ruins social bonds with friends and family solely because vegans become 'that guy' people need to be considerate about when planning dinners and fucks over half the dishes because it would be rude to only make one decent thing vegan. cant relate with vegans over food because their food is over salted and oily or muh UMAMI'D shit that sucks. 
literally all that vegans talk about is their diet they dont know was probably carefully designed by the CIA to psyop people into being hated and isolated by everyone except more deranged vegans

There are 33 billion chickens alive today.
What do you propose we do with them?
In nature they would not survive.
You want us to genocide them?
Same with pigs and cattle.
You want farm animals to be dead rather then alive just because eventually they have to die one way or another.
Oh an hunting is apparently also immoral, because when a wolf gets the deer it is okay, but if its a human its suddenly immoral.
Give me a break 
Vegans are just obnoxious and naive, they should just shut the fuck up.
Honestly every time I hear someone trying to impose his diet on other people I see them as nothing more then a narcissistic manipulator.

How do you justify the killing of a plant you hypocritical nigger, they're alive just as much as animals are and I highly doubt you're the kind of vegan that only eats plant products that doesn't ultimately kill itaww8dk

The animal has done no sin. It is slaughtered for the glory of God.

you decide with your wallet weather those animals live or die 
so technically you, a mindless customer are directly responsible for their deaths.

If I don't have my daily dose of cheese, I'd wage wars and kill millions.

I can't because I really wish I had enough will power to quit meat. Vegans are morally right and I don't understand why people seethe and cope so much over them. Never was bother by a vegan other than ordering food for someone and they politely ordered something else while they told me they are vegan. I guess I'm addicted to meat and spoiled my taste buds too much to make a switch.

Lmao, then why did you make that thread?
The lack of nutrient is rotting the brain of the average vegantard.

Haven't scientists already concluded fish can't feel pain either? Why not eat them?
--- 72988758
>>72988401
idk what clickbait article you went thru but fish absolutely feel pain 
t. used to fish and butcher live fish
--- 72988775
>>72988758
They respond to stimulus, but humans share a concept of "pain" with other mammals that fish are not capable of. Like, they realize when they're injured, but they don't actually suffer because of it.

I'm a vegetarian but my brain doesn't let me be a vegan because it is theoretically possible to obtain eggs and milk ethically while providing a good life for the hens and cows and not harming their male counterparts.

I think in 100 or so years it will be so socially unacceptable to not be vegan + 100% equivalent meat substitutes/synthetic meat will be available that people will be ostracized for admitting they eat meat from a once-living animal.

The only real argument I can kind of get is "the animal is already dead anyway, I didn't kill it, and me not spending money on it isn't going to be an effective boycott in itself when so few other people are boycotting it". The thing I really can't get is people who hunt animals. They act like factory farming is bad but killing animals by other means and taking them away from their families forever is perfectly fine.

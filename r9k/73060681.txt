those questions are so..... hard to answer because I have no idea how "organizing" I am. I really don't know myself enough to be able to answer these questions. I think about it, and I could literally fill every bubble on a single question the more I think about it. I can't take the test. The questions are not good at all. And to answer each one with a scale of 1-7? So weird.
>I follow a system
omg I don't fucking know. Fuck this test

The idea is that if you don't know, you select neutral. Not that hard.

how do your parents feel about you being a useless fuckup waste of resources who never achieved anything?
my parents already knew i had no chance when i was like 11 and have just focused on my younger sister since then who succeeded and is currently life mogging me in all aspects and im happy for her
im just kinda wondering what kind of rng decided us two are literally exact opposites from life to achievements to personalities to essentially everything lol

what about my fellow anons and robots

My parents are pressuring me more and more to move out. Usually I try to lower their expectations of me so that they try to exert less power over me, but at this point they just want me to move out before I get too old

My dad was extremely seething about it until I got diagnosed with autism and started being handed out ~900 euros a month by the state which he pockets.
Guess now it's a mutual parasitic relationship between me and him.

The forced me to get me in gyms, basketball clubs, communities etc. to get me to open up and get friends. Nothing worked, by the time i was an uni student they gave up and they just want me to have a job after graduating.

My mother always had very high hopes for me and i would usually bring home very good grades so she tolerates me NEETing so long as I stay in college and doesn't seem to have any intentions of kicking me out or anything despite the fact that i only have class 3 times a week and wake up at 10pm every day and dont have a job.

My dad blurted out on my birthday that I was born cause he got a lil too tipsy on a fiesta day. And honestly? Fuck does that change I've got a life to live I'm living it, I know deep down my dad loved me even if he didn't express it verbally because he sheltered me even till he passed. He laughed with me at times I didn't know he could, I inherited his stubbornness and temperance, so naturally I aim to become a better person than he ever was. I've to repay him in some way at least.

Oh, hello, brother, how is all that religion stuff working out for ya?
--- 73122778

Then what are you struggling with. Literally just stop thinking about them.

My younger sister is like me but being a woman she's got a social life and people wanting to date her

pussy privilege is real but apparently pointing it out is mysoginistic
--- 73123297

they're in denial. 
my dad is convinced that if i just find a job again and start working at home too fixing my house everything will work out. 
mom is convinced i'm just a late bloomer and that plenty of girls are interested in me but i just blow them off because i'm not ready or secretly gay.
--- 73123326
>>73123297
ahh the secretly gay or rejecting women cope parents think
literally nobody has shown interest in my ever but thats a foreign concept to normies
--- 73123336
literally could not give a ffuck
i hate my parents so much. they decided it would be awesomesauce to keep moving aroound the state while i was in primary school and middle school and high school.
i was already a weirdo from the start but that shit left me completely fucked in the head.
i hope my eventual suicide compeltely breaks them.

yeah its like trying to explain to a spoiled rich kid the concept of being poor through no fault of your own that isn't just your parents cutting you off.
might as well explain the concept of air and surface to a crab that has lived its entire life in the abyss.

pic made me laugh.
also fuck people who don't realize moving around all the time fucks their kids over. even if you were some gigachad or megastacy it would be baggage as an adult that every time you grew close to anyone you moved away anyway.

I reported my abusing father to the police and had my younger sister move in with me. Family was torn but my sister really loves me for it and it's the happiest she has ever been in her whole life

My mom and other people in my life keep trying to motivate me to seek the potential they see in me. I'm more of a disappointment than useless. NEETbux helps keep things comfortable, I pay rent and for my own food and such.
--- 73124339
I pay no rent, I have no expectations placed upon me but to clean the house once a week. They know that if they push me too hard they will suffer the shame of my suicide. It's a big family, the ripples will travel far. Christmas will never be the same.

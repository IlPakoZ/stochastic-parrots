The idea of submissive man is cute, but I guess its just a redflag for lazyass pussy after all.

What exactly would you want from a submissive partner? I'd do pretty much anything to please the woman I loved. I will not take it in the ass though

You have a terribly nasty habit of generalizing anything you dislike. That's an indicator of emotional retardation. It's like a little boy picking on girls for cooties or never turning away all vegetables before they eat them because they didn't like broccoli once. Like holy shit how old are you? Are you really that sensitive and flat out dumb after all this time?

I'm not "submissive" but I have nothing to offer a woman outside love. I'm not attractive, I'm not tall, I'm not interesting and I'm not a billionaire. 90% of "submissive" men are like that too except some internalized negativity to the extent they want to be hurt by a "lover" too

>>72991063
He isnt that interestex in sex, its mostly the other way around.

>>72991147
What do you even define as love

i think maybe if someone wants to live their fetish outside of sex time it's a huge redflag.

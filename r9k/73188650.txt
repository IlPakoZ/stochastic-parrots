I only feel attraction after half a year or something, emotional attraction first and then sexual.

Always thought it was normal but it turns out the dating meme from tv and movies is true for normies. 

The label is odd for normies like you but it is the best way to describe someone like me.

Yep, I'm demisexual, more attracted to mind than body

I guess I'm demisexual kind of sad that needs a label I was under the impression it was the norm but I guess now days everyone fucks people they don't even know.

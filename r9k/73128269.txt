Why do women still care how much a man makes if a lot of them are making more money than men?
If she's making 200k a year does she really need a man to make 200k or more too?

Who even are these people? Are they trying to live in California or New York City?
That's enough income to have great 'rich' lives in the flyover states and smaller cities/towns within big population states

Her money is for when she decides shes bored and wants to go onto the next guy but doesnt want to go homeless because she has no money so they get a job and saves up all her cash for her "level up" fund and makes the man pay for everything.
They also want the man to give them something they cant have themselves so its worth wasting her time on him so they usually demand twice and more of their income so if they earn 100k a year they need at least a guy that earns 200k+ a year

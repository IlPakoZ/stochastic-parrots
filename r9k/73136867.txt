My gfs visa is expiring soon and she wont able to extend it, that means she will have to go back to her country and I will never see her again; people come into your life and leave just as fast :(

If you can't think of a solution to this problem, then you deserve what becomes of you. I look forward to your list of excuses

gee, if only there was a way to extend visas indefinitely and and fast track the path to citizenship, a way that is infamously abused and the plot of many romcoms and sitcom episodes.
oh well. i suppose there is nothing a man and a woman can do in such cases.

why not?
if she agrees to getting a court contract marriage with prenup there isn't a hassle, even if you're both just 18 or some shit. the younger you are the less it matters that you dont live together. if it ever becomes a topic just play poor and stupid. even if your parents give you shit they cant really do much more than that now can they?
honestly to me it sounds romantic.

dont think. tell her the plan right now and say if you want to get married for real some day you just hold the ceremony or divorce first then get married.

If you trust her, then marry her.

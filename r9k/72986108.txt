Why do the nicest people always turn out to be the most abusive?

Even guys who have such obvious red-flags from the start aren't nearly as abusive.

McManus was so non-threatening as a prison figurehead. Dude was about as intimidating as my high school history teacher.

Sounds like you are making shit up because you don't feel you have the capacity to return the niceness. You are making villian out a good person just to feel ok about being selfish.

if you expect niceness to be returned (or think it should be), then you're neither a nice person nor a good one.

If you think any of what you said proves what I said wrong then you are wrong. A person who does selfless acts must not expect anything in return but the receiver should have the shame and decency to return it. If I am extremely broke and some fellas gives me money expecting I will never be able to return it then it doesn't mean I must not return the money if I miraculously get some. Dumb autist you are.

Correct (for the most part).

>but the receiver should have the shame and decency to return it.
Congrats on being a shitty, selfish person, Anon.

None of this is what any nice person would (generally) say.

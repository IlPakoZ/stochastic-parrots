there is an old joke from the 13 colonies of America. 
>native american seething at his son for having a horse instead of hunting on foot
>the horse riding son seethes at his son for using a firearm instead of a bow
>his son in turn seethes at his son for using a steam boat 
>the entire time the white settlers are fucking their women.
Stop caring about things that dont matter like demotivational posters from 2005 that werent even funny at the time and actually participate in your own life.

Okay come on, you're allowed to be nostalgic all you want but let's not try to pretend that internet memes weren't facebook boomer tier back then.

I sort of wonder, it seems like zero zoomers have a sense of humor plus this very strange desire to be super cool to randos on the internet they'll literally never meet.

it's very strange, living life with a stick up your ass all the time

You are retarded, you're just becoming a part of a literal NPC cycle that's been happening since we've had written accounts of life lmao. Do you not see that?

Just goes to show how unjaded and positive everyone was. Now memes need to be on at least three levels of irony and ideally shit on some political group you hate because you can only enjoy other people's misery at this point.

I hate to stick up for zoomers, but it's not 100% them. The internet is plagued with people that don't know how to use it. 60+ dullards, third-worlders, bots, bored housewives, and they outnumber former internet users 10 to 1.

There's funny and creative stuff online but it's drowning under a sea of normalscum bores and low-attention span outrage-tainment. Now that cable TV is dying, the media companies are trying to bring that type of pablum to the internet and sadly it's working.

The average extrovert normie doesn't have a very good sense of humor. What they know how to do is join a group and then shit on anyone not in that group so they can feel special. That's why things are mutating into the "humor" we have now. It's 90%: "look at this ugly wojak, he's ugly like you are, I don't like you." unfunny, witless, childish in-group behavior.

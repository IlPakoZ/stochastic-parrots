People have taste in genes. If you don't have the right genes they will never have taste in you, no matter how hard you work. Why exactly do we keep this a secret from so many young men? Scared they'll drop out of capitalism or become criminals?

If you have shit genes can you kill yourselves and do something about instead of bitching on 4chan?

Why can't people just be honest and say the way they treat people is completely gene-based and taste-based and has little to do with how much "work" a person puts in. It is what it is. Are all the lies necessary? Yeah it'd be nice if we lived in an authentic meritocracy and that's definitely something to strive for. But why deny reality and blame victims who never had a chance by lying and pretending they indeed had a chance and did something to "blow" it.

Are you sure about that? So why don't you just go gay? It sounds like genes don't even matter.

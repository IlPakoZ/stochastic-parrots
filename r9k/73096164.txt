Just ghost him if you want to be a cunt. Otherwise, tell him the truth and stop speaking to him.

he knows too much about my irl identity.. like my university and teachers, he even emailed them once. if i ghost him he'll probably find me irl. but he's also so dependant on me, if i leave he's stated before he's suicidal. i think he has BPD

You don't need to be in love. If you like him/her and he/she likes you too. Then don't trash what you have. So many do this mistake.

Let it just develop in time and see, where it goes. Who knows it might end going to be some good storytime.

the real reason i dont like him is because physically he's not my type.. at all. i just feel grossed out when i look at him, and since i admitted my feelings before he actually showed his face, he has changed the way he speaks to me. i just feel disgusted when we talk, but still i spend hours with him everyday, for like 4 months now

Sounds like you need to move on. You mentioned ghosting is bad idea and I agree. Ghosting is always shit move if you stop all contacts suddenly. 

Start reducing contact slowly. "Being busy" etc. Be less warmer and casual with conversations. Nothing romantic and just let things cool down.

As time goes by just fade away. Soon you both don't talk etc. If he messages you don't answer asap. Give it days between answers in the end you just don't answer at all.

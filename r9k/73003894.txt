>principle calls dad
>he works in a military contracting business
>under normal circumstances, he gets pissed when called at work since he is working with extremely hazardous materials
>I can hear him through the principle's phone
>"My son is in your office? What did he do?"
>the principle replies that I punched a potato
>she leaves out the fact he provoked me
>"Give me an hour." -click
>sitting outside the principle's office
>my father, with a red face for having to leave work calmly asks for my side of the story before talking to the principle
>he's pissed
>explain my side
>he's getting redder and redder by the minute
>he forcefully opens the principle's door and begins berating and verbally undresses her within an inch of her life
>"What kind of school is this? One where people aren't supposed to stand up for themselves? Are you so incompetent at your job that you are punishing the victim rather than the perpetrator just because he's a potato. I don't care how retarded he is, my son did the right thing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. If you ever interact with my son again, you better have a much better reason than this. I'm coming for you if you ever mess with him again."
He said much more than just this, but that's what I remember
>hear all of this while sitting on the bench outside of the open door
>during the drive home, he says he loves me and that I did the right thing

Love you dad

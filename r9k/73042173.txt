not being a retard but asking honestly, for people who dont watch anime, why dont you? it speaks to the human experience and its entertaining. humans love stories and anime has a plethora of original stories unlike western entertainment where its just hollywood schlop and john wick fast and furious movie clone #46. particularly if youre a guy then fightfag shit is insanely fun to watch building hype around 2 characters and watching their ideologies and physical strength go at eachother with ridiculous powers and stuff. its just super interesting and unique entertainment that i feel like people miss out on

I just don't have the attention span to follow along with a multi episode series. This applies to Netflix or regular TV shows too. I do like the reaction pics and memes that stem from them and chan culture tho

I could never get into how the animation itself is usually like a slideshow. I also hate the voice acting in every anime I've ever seen, for some reason.
I've enjoyed the little manga I've read far more than any anime, since it obviously doesn't have those issues. Still, I prefer to just read books.

Im not big into movies and animation especially, but anime outright sucks ass. Only high quality stuff like Spirited Away is worth watching (50% of its worth is music)
Anime is simply annoying. But hey I don't judge, I've seen Black Hawk Down >10 times

1. Cringe humour
2. Cringe voice acting
3. Cringe character writing
4. Fanservice

There are some good ones, Angel Beats was pretty good, but it's not worth it to sift through the shit.

sucks at objective to what though? random disney cartoons and nickelodeon shows is the standard of animation in the west, compared to japan where its things like demon slayer and aot which have 100x more improved animation and adult themes. or are you saying anime sucks compared to ghibli films like spirited away, which a lot of people say but ghibli is just normalfag shit desu, my mom likes ghibli films

Anime is indeed a slide show like >>73042215 said, you can't convince me that its animated better than any disney stuff (which Im not a fan of either, never even seen lion king kek).
Anime has worth in its uniqueness though, can't think of anything like death note in the west
But again, im a degenerate from r9k, don't take my criticism as something valid

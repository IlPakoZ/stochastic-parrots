So? That's your automatic response to anything that challenges your world view. It's like saying having fresh tires on a racecar can make it go faster, and you just respond every time that 'well the engine matters more'. Everyone fucking knows this already. Damn near everyone here has a shitty engine, so let's talk about things we can improve or change instead of making the same posts over and over again whining about how only engines matter and that physics only cares how good our engine is. Other stuff matters

They love that on tall handsome chads yea, that's why robots fail
--- 73137289
No, women hate losers who don't get anything done. You don't need to crumble under the weight of your nerves, you just need to get a hold of them. You can have high neuroticism and still thug it out and accomplish things. Go lift weights or something, that's a good way to start. It reduces your overall anxiety levels better than medication if you keep at it. Also raises T which helps with mood regulation

again, this doesnt matter unless you actually get a chance to show your personality, which robots don't have.

neuroticism doesnt matter when women have no idea if you are neurotic or not. They only bother to get to know your personality if you have good looks.
--- 73137364
>>73137333
Women are just very disappointing in general, there's a lot to be desired. They are not very good at psychology or mind games either. Isn't that all they are naturally wired for? And yet they get filtered? I'm very disappointed. I'm not gay either, so perhaps I'll invent a new gender that I can be clinically attracted to. Not that I'm not attracted to women, but the residual disappointment is like bin juice on cake. I've had enough.
--- 73137379
>>73137364
Very true, they sometimes convince themselves they're good at manipulation since that's supposed to be their advantage since they are physically weak, but most of the time the men are letting them have an illusion of power and 'mind games' for sex.

My point is that you can overcome neuroticism. Get a hold of it, make it serve you instead of the other way around

ive spent most of the past decade trying to improve my looks to the point one woman would be willing to speak to me.

fuck you op I would do ANYTHING to get a gf. they dont give two shits about personality though. thats why you've never been able to give any actionable advice in these shitty threads. what the fuck is an ugly guy supposed to do when women wont even speak to him? at best we don't exist to women, at worst thry hate us for being genetic failures. If you put me in the body of an average looking guy I GUARANTEE i would have a gf right now, but I can never show any of my good traits when women decide to avoid ugly men like the plague. if you have nothing that works why do you keep coming back and posting these shitty threads?

sigh... improving your body improves your mental state. they work in tandem. i agree w/ the dude you're replying to. you ARE making excuses.

--- 73137966
>>73137834
your desperation is off the charts just from my very limited interactions w/ you itt. i can only imagine how obvious it must be in person. say if you're talking to a colleague, neighbor, family member, store clerk, whatever. any female bystanders could be eavesdropping and get a waft and a half of your desperation. they probably smell it from a mile away. they don't need to interact w/ you directly. they hear it in the inflexions of your voice.

dw tho brotha. i'm pretty neurotic myself. but since i've been volunteering at a thrift shop part-time for a few months now, my people skills have improved tremendously. improving your social skills and losing that robot angst by volunteering somewhere or going gym is sth you can do. so make work of it king.

this doesnt happen because women never speak to me
--- 73138155
>>73137834
>WOMEN DO NOT TALK TO ME AT ALL
At all? If thats the case, try to forget about getting a gf and focus on your communication skills with women. Build some sort of a "ladder". Start low, like speaking with family members. Then with women you dont find attractive at all, like older women or fatties. Then you should go talk to normie girls, all the while not trying to get a gf. You are just getting to know people and learning to small talk. If you were to go on and talk to even slighty attractive girls right of the bat, you would fail due to anxiety even when not trying to get a gf.

I missed a connection with a spiritual flirty blonde the other day who was buying essential oils and saying how nice her kitchen smelled because of it, for example

it was just an example. but they could still hear you talking or read your body language in passing, and make a judgment within seconds.

as for how to say what or body language... there's no end all be all, and i would avoid relying purely on youtube vids for this kinda stuff. what's much more valuable, in my experience, is practice, as in learning it by doing it. be it sports, lifting, a hobby you have to leave the house for, or a part-time job (even a voluntary one). doing any of these things will improve your social skills significantly. the more you interact w/ others irl, the better you get at it.

Guys are willing to hang out and shoot the shit with me, but women won't even speak to me. ive also tried more dating apps than I can count, plus i bought premium on all of them, but no women will even match with me so theres no opportunity to show who I am as a person

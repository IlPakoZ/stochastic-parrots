I just can't accept being an incel. I'm 27 and not even one decent looking girl has ever been interested in me. I'm not even a bad looking guy. My grandma tells me I'm handsome all the time. This relationship stuff happens so effortlessly, so naturally for other people. It just flows to them somehow. I've never understood that. My brother is only 2 inches taller than me and his face is better. He gets so many girls it's insane. And they are all good looking. And he can't understand my problems it's like he thinks I'm making it up and it's all my fault. I'm doing the same shit you're doing and it just doesn't fucking work.

Sadly, women's standards became insanely high in the past decade. Being a manlet is a death sentence.
A man needs face, height and frame. To be deficient in any of those is to be pretty much doomed to guaranteed inceldom.
The fucked up thing is that in your grandma's day, almost none of us would be incel (or NEET/poor). Yet more signs that the world turned to shit 50-80 years ago.

Angela is the GOAT porn goddess, no doubt, not even close.

However lately I've been really getting into babecock gooning seshes. Can heartily recommend.
--- 73025019
I've been unemployed for 3 years.

All kicked off. Not going to CEX now.

Am fumiing. It all Britfeel fault x
--- 73025028
Not a fan of this new hhl arc tbqh, only been at it for a couple of hours and it's already grown stale. Britfeel writers team need to sort their act out, just phoning it in at this point. Maybe we need a new character, or one of the characters could die to great fanfare.
--- 73025036
>>73025019
My uncle has literally never had a job and all his friends are the same. They're just fully grown men who signed up to bennies when they were 18 and just never came off. They're in their fifties. It's so incredibly pathetic. They're all 'off' a bit as well when you interact with them, like not exactly autism but just like they're slow and never learnt how to run their own lives.
--- 73025047
Mam just just put the phone down on me said I'm too drunk. Just want to go CEX to sell me Samsung S10. It all Britfeel fault.

It's mad how you can never work a day in your life despite having nothing physically or mentally wrong with you.

It's pretty easy if you are willing to go on all the job search courses the job centre force on you
--- 73025121
>>73025090
Exactly. They're just these nobodies, these zeros barely scraping by and just milling around all day, yet the state sees fit to give them an obviously livable wage taken from productive people. They're the kind of people who always 'have a story' about why they can't work or what's wrong with them this week medically, or why they find it difficult to 'get my head in line to write a CV, but I will next week for sure'. I've never known them to visit the jobcentre either, are they just legacied in and can't legally be denied bennies because of muh human rights?

Just taking some time off my first Gooning shift to make some lunch. Been gooning since 9am. It so wovely, it so wanky. My tenga egg subscription came in the post this morning too so have been luxuriating in some of the most heavenly goon sessions.
Heading back into the Goon Cave at 4pm to resume gooning till about 9pm.
And it's lush, I mean lush.
It's a hard old goon but somebody has to fucking do it.
Cheers x
--- 73026117
I mean, you need to proper diet to really get the most out of your goon sessions and a zinc supplement is a minimum requirement.
No nasty fast food for me my lads only lots of fresh fruit and vegetables with wholemeal carbs and fresh meat from the butchers.
Lots of hydration and minerals for me, my leeeeed

You've done no such thing, you received no such item and you won't be doing anything like that later today.

You're just browsing 4chan and Youtube videos which you then close after a couple of minutes before loading up one of the games you got for free on Epic Games, before deciding you don't fancy playing that after all and heading back to Youtube.

Watched the space x launch thing today. I dislike Musk, I don't think people should be spending billions on 'le interplanetary travel' meme, it was basically a colossal waste of money and resources and of course that rockers aren't a new thing. Man has made it to the moon. But watching it moved it me in a weird way, maybe it was the fact that people can build rockets like this. Insane to me, and insaner still that rocket launching from the conception of air vehicles were only a few decades apart.

Poor Charlie. A grown man in his forties harassing some young adults minding their own business. You can tell deep down he is a lonely man who craves to have a friend group like that. He never did. Instead he copes by seeking attention in obnoxious ways. A narcissistic man who often picks on vulnerable members of society couldn't realise he took a big L here.

I feel sorry for the lonely soul. These kids have love and friendship, arguably the most important things that makes a man functional and moral. The shell of a human filming them is filled with hate and wants to make others suffer. The amount of jealously and rage he must be feeling to do such a thing...it must be a very depressing life he leads when he's not filming people.

If everyone behaved like these, there would be no Charlies, no ABs and pranksters. As the older generations die out, we will slowly start seeing people having more respect towards others sexuality and genders.

Thought his girlfriend split up from him and went to another man. There's also some shady things about him trying to groom a teenager some years ago.
--- 73027044
I find the concept of auditors hilarious, kind of like sovereign citizens in the US. They just go up to random people minding their own business and purposefully cause trouble by insisting they can enter restricted areas and that they can film people. They're going out to provoke reactions out of regular people who obviously get fed up with some sweaty, smelly, clearly unemployed and often overweight mong shoving a camera in their face and asking them questions over the specifics of privacy and trespassing law.

Makes me chuckle to think about them desu. Sad little men.

so is it them doing the auditing on the auditor?
--- 73027054
Can't watch these auditors without cringing for them. They have to do this to feel powerful, to have any semblance of being a man. I image them checking the comments every time one is posted so they can puff out their chest, proud of themselves, their adoring followers admire their courage.

Within the first 30 seconds he repeats what one of them says "you've heard a lot about me". From there its all down hill for his already inflated ego.

Don't care if you believe me or not lad, I was born in 1979 and having friends was never based on how good looking you were/are. What a load of wank that anyone would say this and expect it to be believable.

I wish I went and focused on education instead of coping with video games in my late teens. I remember being on Gears all day, every day for years. It's too late now I've realised you must keep up pace with others in your age group.

Are you smirnoff? Hes about that age
--- 73027487
Remember it's damn near impossible to make friends past 30. It's like everyone gets too exhausted and just focuses on raising their family at this point.

--- 73027517
>>73027451
Imagine if we played with each other, I was on it a lot too so there's a small chance we might have gotten matched together. It would have been small chance though because I remember back in the day Gears of War was fucking huge, sad to see how far it's fallen today.
--- 73027518
Reality slapping me hard in face. Still never listened...

Don't pass a good thing by, well I did.

I would often join public horde matches. Sometimes it didn't work out, other times we went all the way to round 50. Hearing people talk about their lives and thanking me felt good. I tried playing the latest ones and it just doesn't feel the same anymore. I stopped around Gears 3. Now I hear the lobbies are difficult to attract enough players. Where as it was always busy until the next game come out on 360.

Good on him for standing up against tyranny.
--- 73027610
>>73027549
Yeah, for me the peak was 2. What a game. 3 was good but didn't have the same charm. Everything after that is just sad. I tried 5 last year and yeah the multiplayer is dead. You can get games but many modes are dead and will never match you with anyone, and the lobby browser never has more than a couple pages of games.
--- 73027644
Garn to the shoppington for more wooze me. I hope I get knocked down and killed on the way.

Sorry to everyone I've let down.

We all wored in life x
--- 73027664
>>73027610
Yeah same. Great game and it felt so good to have better multiplayer. The first one was all peer to peer so people could ddos you, have host advantage (who'd quit the match if losing to disconnect everyone) and had so many cheaters (crabwalking out of the map). I hated how the first game's Seriously achievement wasn't accurate.

Unfortunately Gears paved the way for skins in video games as we know them today. Everyone wanted those golden weapons given out during E3 and the greedy publishers saw this as an opportunity to make a lot of money. I will never play multiplayer shit again.

--- 73027760
>>73027664
Oh god, I remember those golden guns. Yeah I wanted them badly too kek.

There's been a rumor for a few years that there might be a 'Marcus Fenix Collection' that remasters Gears 1-3 sort of like the Halo Master Chief Collection. While I want that to happen I also think it would be incredibly sad to be playing these games again all these years later in the exact same teenage bedroom of mine that I am still in. If I told teenager me that I would be playing this game again in like 15 years later with my life being like this, it would be like I was stuck in some fucking horrible time loop. It would be both a happy and sad moment to play such a modern remaster.
--- 73027764
It makes me sad knowing I never had the uni experience. I guess I was meant to be a deano roadsmen type lad but that never happened either.

Yeah you missed out lad. I finished in in '20. Was fucking brilliant times.
--- 73027803
>>73027760
They did remaster the first one but I barely played it. It just didn't hit the dopamine anymore. I actually feel sad playing remasters of old games as I think back to my youth. I can't fully enjoy them as I too am still in the same place I was then. There's no way I'd pay for these remasters is true but they'll be on Game Pass anyway.
--- 73027842

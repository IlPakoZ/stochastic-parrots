I personally just miss having fun playing vidya pulling all nighters, going to sleep at dawn or just staying awake for 36 hours.
Ah I should get drunk and do that next time I'm on paid time off. If I'm lucky I might die too

I talk to my coworkers sometimes. I'm generally pretty nice to people and try to help but I completely shut off when I get home or I'm at a party

We were in the printing room and she ran her hand down my back and hit my butt when I was about to leave. Before that, we were just complaining to each other 

Also hugged when we went to a lunch a day later

Bend her over the photocopier and give her a hard fuck or forever accept the fact that you are a homosexual, OP. (There's no shame in that nowadays.)

If you're too tired to fuck her just ask her to be on top

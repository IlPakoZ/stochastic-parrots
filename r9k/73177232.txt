I am a total loner. Haven't had friends in 2-3 years. I sometimes don't speak out words fluently and I feel like my voice is too loud/not loud enough at times. Most conversations bore me too. I am humorless. I don't hate myself but I understand the importance of acting social, but I can't manage it.

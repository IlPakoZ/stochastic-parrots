-Post art you like 
-The reason you like it
-Name of the artist 

Just wanted to switch things up a bit here as I'm sure we probably have some artists on this board (though you don't have to be to share). We are basically creating our own art exhibit as more posters come in the thread. None of this has to reversed, just stuff you like. You can post art from even someone you follow on Twitter, lol. Let's just try to have a good time guys.

Is this art? I honestly can't tell
--- 73027633
Or is it not art? Feedback appreciated
--- 73027635
>>73027622
The thread was worth it just so I could see this, so cool.
--- 73027648

can you tell me what I'm looking at?
--- 73027674
>>73027648
uhhhh nah
--- 73027696
Behold, I have made this art.

I like it because it looks sick af and is very nostalgic for me. I loved Scary Stories To Read In The Dark as a kid. The artists name is Stephen Gammel
--- 73027707
>>73027703
I loved these books
--- 73027715
Is metalworking art?
--- 73027733
The Biting Pear of Salamanca
If you don't recognize this influential artwork, I laugh out loud and openly question what you've been doing.

is this a bull passing through dimensions?

I looked him up, he's made some cool shit.

-The reason you like it
Completely shattered my view of what Angels looked like. This is actually a more accurate representation of them.

made by my favorite artist louis wain
--- 73028373
>>73028363
Another art from Mr. Wain.
--- 73028431
>>73028373
The colors are so vibrant.
--- 73028435
I made this the other day
--- 73028468
>>73028435
ngl, pretty cool. I really like the sharp differences between the sky and the beach.
--- 73028536
>>73028435
>>73028468
I should clarify, I mean the sharp difference in color of the two.
--- 73028725
I've been getting deep into Edgar Allan Poe lately and become obsessed with Harry Clarke's illustrations for his stories. This one is for "The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar", one of my favourites.
I like it because it encapsulates everything great about visual horror: disgust, shock, gloom, mystery, etc.
--- 73029422
>>73028725
Favorite story, original?
--- 73029514
>>73029422
NTA, but I've always like The Cask of Amontillado. Short and sweet.
--- 73029608
>>73029422
The Fall of the House of Usher. It's pretty much perfect from start to finish, extremely subtle and unnerving in its implications. It blows my mind that Poe wrote it when he did, given the state of "horror" at the time.
--- 73029639
I like this because it's a pug eating ice cream painted in an outsider art style with soft idk pastels or something it's pleasing to the eye and makes me smile. He has other works like a pug on the shitter, a pug flossing his teeth, just good shit. This one speaks to me the best. You can find prints on ebay I have one in cubist style of a pug but it's by a different artist I always confuse the two because they both draw pugs but other dogs as well

I suppose this is exhibiting art, with a reading of the short story I suggested? I'll continue if anyone likes, I quite enjoy reading these stories out loud. I tried to do a voice, I'm not that great at them but I'd like to improve, and this is quite fun practice.
--- 73030526
I saw this here the other day and thought it was pretty cool.
--- 73030537
>>73030160
For sure, but could you read a bit slower?
--- 73030673
>>73030537
https://voca.ro/19puBW8EvH1Q
Tried to go a bit slower, I do have a tendency to read a little fast. And that's the end, thought it'd take me longer than that. A few hiccoughs here and there, sorry for the occasional stammer.

Did you do drama in highschool?
--- 73030982

No, I never did. I'll choose to take that as a compliment though, thanks!

This is from an artist my mother likes, it's pretty cool.
--- 73032089
>>73032073
you have a name of the artist for us?

Pretty much anything from Micah Mullen looks pretty cool. I like it because it reminds me a lot of patterns I've seen on LSD and other psychedelic drugs. I visited his stand in Ann Arbor Michigan when they were doing the Ann Arbor Art Fair.
>picrel is his art style
--- 73032195
>>73032166
All the art at the art fair was pretty expensive, but he had these little paintings of Peter Griffin done in his art style. It's a really small painting that fits in your hand.
>I didn't take the plastic off so it is a bit blurry.
Pretty cool art and cool guy. It's the only art at the fair I was impressed with. The rest of the art was fine art aka art that's meant to be sold to the rich folk of Ann Arbor.
--- 73032446
>>73032195
I'm actually super close to there, is it really worth going to?
--- 73032549
>>73032166
thats actually really cool. i used to draw stuff of a similar sort but never put it all together so well. i need to find more artists like this

This picture you posted, I remember seeing a video about it that was talking about some type of rare gigantic waves that occur in the occeans, way bigger than normal tsunamies.

Rogue waves is the name for these kind of waves, here is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tktJss1x0eA&amp;ab_channel=EmpLemon [Embed]

"Boy with Apple" a Renaissance masterpiece by the artist Johannes Van Hoytl the Younger.
--- 73032724
This is my shit right here.
This is art.
I love this painting because it is the litmus test for if you are a normalfag or not.
If you're cool, you appreciate it for its bold lines, proportions, and bright color.
If you're lame, you say something like "wow, shapes. I can do that" while having no training, and if you actually tried it, it would be garbage; no, you can't, you brain-dead crapmonger. You are no Piet Mondrian.

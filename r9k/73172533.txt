I seriously doubt that. can you name an event that happened in your life that was your closest to being a "life experience"

A "life experience" is a meaningless term. You are experiencing life every second. Why should anyone else get to devalue that just because they think your version of life is "boring"?

Because in not doing something unique you are wasting your time reliving the same moment until you die, like man do you have autism? Is understanding this beyond you?

There is no unique life experience. Anything you see or feel has been seen and felt thousands of times by now. Just enjoy the ride.

It is incredibly easy to have life experiences. Go outside and talk to random people, you will be humiliated, you will likely embarrass yourself, some Karen feminists might even accuse you of sexual harassment, but you will get some interesting life experiences.

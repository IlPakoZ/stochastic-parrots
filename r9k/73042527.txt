Sad, it's the reason space exploration ended the way it did. Dump all that funding into welfare and various programs and the problem is worse than ever. If you dare suggest NASA gets a bump in funding you get these same niggers ranting the same thing. It will doom us as a species, even Christ understood you can't fix poverty there will always be poor.

You were born here and you will die here.

People only take issue when whitey says "we", any other race identifies with their race and you people don't say a single word about it. Only time white people are allowed to say "we" is when it's a self loathing liberal disparaging other whites.

It's pretty accurate 
People who support space exploration are legitimately people who have been completely broken by corporations and the elite.
It's like the retards actually think they'll have any benefit from people going to space.
If humanity does develop space-faring technology that supports life in space, it 100% won't include 99% of the population
It will very likely be like the movie Elysium, not in it's entirety, but in concept
I% of the population is like 80,000,000 fucking people

People that fantasize and support any resources being put into space are genuinely stupid in my opinion. 
It makes far more sense to put any money going into space in biomechanics or organic chemistry.

This species is going to be pretty harshly met with by nature soon enough though. I just hope that teh people who survive aren't the shitty fucking elites who led humanity to this juncture

>Same cold be said thousand years ago with the exploration of the sea and the new world.
Right but that doesn't make it true.
In order for a person to even get into space, they'll need to pay tons of money for equipment to allow them to live in space.
Back then, it was the same basic rules as the settled parts of the world. Going up to space introduces a whole new set or rules. Even if you could pay the exorbitant amount of money to go up into space, it's not like once you get there you're free to use your own tools and build your own dwelling in an unclaimed section of land. 

The only habitable places in space will be places that were already intentionally constructed; you will have to be leasing basically ever piece of "ground" that you interact with. 

Like I said, it will be like Elysium. It will be a pre-fabricated system that people will have to pay money to the owners in order to be involved. 1% of the extant population is literally 80,0000,000 fucking people. You really think that the richest people in the world will spend tons of their money to build platforms for every single person in the world to live on?
If that were the case, they would already be doing a lot more humanitarian shit right now. How many places don't even have paved roads or running water? If the richest people in the world really wanted to, they could fix a lot of the issues right now. 
It's just that they like having money in the bank because it makes their brains feel good

made me think about the time NASA spent a bunch of money trying to make pencils that were usable in space without leaving dust that could be sucked into the electronics and machinery. in the end a pen corporation as a publicity stunt made pens that were usable in a vast array of temperatures and pressures and any angle for cheaper and more effective than the pencils NASA had.

Pleb take. You think individuals alone by themselves can build societies that fundamentally leads to flourishing scientific research?.

Leibniz and Newton invented calculus, but they did not invent derivatives, integration, Taylor series, or even the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

a very rough notion of integration goes back to the ancient Greeks. Archimedes already developed the method of exhaustion to the point where he could compute the volume of a cone, sphere, etc.

Likewise, Bhaskaracharya II made many remarkable improvements upon existing knowledge, and worked with what we today would recognize as derivatives and integrals. He even had a preliminary notion of infinitesimals. 

Throughout history, science could flourished only in harsh yet stable environment coupled with genetic disposition. The Persians contribution to mathematics is underappreciated yet they lived in shitty landa ruled by retarded sand nigger war mongering arabs who claimed their history. Culture and inventions as their own.

To be honest, you're right, but I could throw the same logic back at you. I'm not so pathetic and useless that I would ever, ever find myself begging on the side of the street for scraps. I will almost certainly go my entire life from beginning to end without ever having to seriously worry about basic needs like food, water and shelter, so why should I care about what happens to either of those groups of people? Neither of them actually, directly affect my life in a real way. So I'm left with "what would you RATHER have?" And the answer is fucking clear. I more capable, space faring civilization. God forbid our country actually does something useful and impressive. It might actually like, unify the American people in some small way, and we absolutely absolutely cannot have that!

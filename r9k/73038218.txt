The main thing that all robots need to drill into their mind is that life isn't fair, and it's a constant uphill battle. I understand that the unfairness of life evokes serious emotional responses, and in my opinion it is warranted. I wish life was better and people more decent. But it doesn't matter what should be, what matters is what "is." That's the only thing you should ever worry about. Did getting upset about how your dick was mutilated, that you were bullied in school, that normalfags will most likely be more successful than you'll ever be, that you have autism or any other disability, that your genes suck, etc: did that change anything? I bet it didn't. Circumstances allow some people to be more successful than you and be dicks at the same time. You don't expect reality to confrom to you, make sure you conform to reality. For most people, life is plenty hard, but if you're on here, you need to fight for every inch of your life. Think about what you truly want, and ask yourself if you are willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve those goals. A lot of people have easy lives. Don't think about them. Don't compare yourself to them, because comparing solves nothing. What matters is taking action into your own hands, and forgetting about everything else. Remember, even if you try your hardest, there is a chance thst you might not go anywhere. But not trying gurantees failure. Ignore those people who say you "didn't try hard enough" while doing jack shit to be successful. As I said, focus on yourself.

Got into an argument with a plumber today. Phoned up to complain he'd fixed my boiler in an unsafe way and he kept trying to take the piss out of me for not being able to do it myself. He said "even if I did do it unsafely, it's still a lot better than you could ever do."

I never understood that. Most girls film on their latest iPhones. Doesn't it automatically do a 4K video? I see it's mostly 1080 or 720 when on YouTube. I guess they use so much storage from the thousands of selfies and have to record in lower quality.

In 2021 I inherited a spinning jenny and wool carder from my grandmother. She was fucking loaded so it really infuriated me, to be fair I am the wealthiest of her 4 grandchildren, so to a degree it was understandable she'd think I need the money less, but it still felt like a rejection.

My 3 cousins got a 6 figure inheritance each, and they really lorded it over me. But I did find the spinning jenny and wool carder quite fascinating in an eccentric way. I decided I may as well make use of it so I start looking up raw wool and went to an auction. Bought a sack and carded it and spun the thread into a yarn. Made me very first jumper just in time for Christmas 2021 as gas prices were already starting to rise.

I had enough wool for a small jumper and sold it on eBay. Couldn't believe it sold for 26 bong. I only paid pennies for the wool and it took me less than 2 hours to make. Essentially I was getting 12 bong an hour profit for this. I went to another auction and bought a lot more wool in February 2022. Spend a weekend carding the lot and made loads of yarns of wool. Over the course of last year my business on eBay has been really successful, and I've ever started a small YouTube channel teaching people how to knit. For the 2022/2023 tax year I made a total of 92,106 all in all, combined sales from eBay, YouTube revenue, Patreon subscribers and my knitting course. In the end I gained a lot more being left an old trinket than a hundred grand in cash could have ever given me.

True that but women have a surplus of really attractive men to pick from on dating apps. Most dating apps are 90% men. Men don't even care if the girl is employed or not. That's what happens when there are too many men. Women end up being very selective.
--- 73143062
>>73143045
Women only date men when they can get something out of said man. I have nothing to offer so I am ignored. It is unfair and means Chad gets women on average while nice humble guys like me get left behind.

--- 73143289
The good thing about tinder/pof/okc is that you can send literally thousands of messages/swipes to women so 10,000 swipes/messages can translate to 30 conversations and 5 meetups.

And Tinder will do it's hardest to keep you single. Finding a relationship means they won't be getting any money from you. So they will do their best to sabotage it.
--- 73143337

I guarantee if I was this persistent I still wouldn't get a date. But if I was some unemployed single mum, I'd get laid the same night I registered. Grim.

>>73143319
Do you watch lotus eaters? I think connor said what you've just posted verbatim the other day.

Just imagine walking into a bar, with a carbon copy spiel, and saying it to every single woman in the space of 2 minutes. You'd be chucked out in minutes, but on dating sites that's how it works, flood 100 inboxes a night and you're guaranteed 1-3 conversations, maybe 10 if you're really lucky.
--- 73143392
>>73143296

Nah she'd be a Twitch e-girl streamer most likely. That generates just as much betabux from simps as ASMR does.

Ruthmong giving Broadbridge a cheeky smile before they have their first gay experience together.
--- 73143411
>>73143349
Nope I don't but what I said makes perfect sense from a capitalist perspective. They earn billions from lonely men. The app is not there to help you find love. It's there to make money. So they'll want to keep you invested in it at least for a good few years before maybe actually giving you something suitable as a match. Even then there's no guarantee.

Imagine being so soulless and capitalising love. No wonder more young men are single than ever before. It's time for them to pull out of society and stop contributing.
--- 73143415
The day I lost my virginity aged 22, in the morning I installed a new dating app, and sent a message to about 30-40 women saying "Do you fancy a fuck tonight?", one replied "yeah xx" and then we arranged it. It was that simple

She was 30, she never knew. Actually after the act during pillow talk she was saying she would never shag a virgin as they are too clingy. Funny thing is a week later she text me for a re-run and I deleted her

It's a lifestyle choice. More kids means more money and they get to keep their three bedroom house all paid for by the taxpayer. So fucking grim. They'll never get any respect from me.

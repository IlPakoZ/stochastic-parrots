i just went out on a walk alone for what is essentially the first time in my life. is this really what everyone has been telling me to do? it doesnt feel good or fun or anything. i want to be in my room instead of outside. why does everyone want me to talk to people and do things?

They tell you to do it so you're not a fat cunt

Yeah because walking alone makes you not fat. Nothing to do with not eating like a pig.

anything youre not used to doing is going to be hard but sometimes hard things help your grow and help you to appreciate better the things you have in life or something

i eat 300-500 calories a day
>>72985812
what do you mean
>>72985819
no its seriously just boring. i had the opportunity to go out with friends and it is honestly a chore i dislike it. i really prefer staying in my bed all day

A walk in the woods is a lot better. It's very relaxing. What anime is that image from btw? It looks like haganai

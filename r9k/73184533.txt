Get up and sit at a different scene. Move the chair loudly and make a scene out of it.

Personally i would be happy for them and hope for the best, seeing happy couples make me feel a tiny bit better

The cafe I'm in doesnt have that option, besides I prefer to chill in a cafe for an hour anyway.

I sympathise. Though shit like this is why I think going outside is very over-rated.
I have sat in a small park with a coffee, but also have to deal with noisy children and seeing normies/couples. Fuck, I miss the lockdown.

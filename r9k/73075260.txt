You should develop charisma / self-confidence. You start at the group's average expressional style and then as you become integrated into it and comfortable with them start speaking in your natural voice unselfconsciously and without thinking about it, which shifts the collective expressional style towards your innate one

Or just be yourself and don't let retards dictate how you talk.

Right, but you can also shift others towards you rather than just obliquely (I'm not sure if that's the right word) asserting your model. Sorta like, there's a difference between being an accepted outsider and being identified as a core member. In the former case your differentiated expression is treated as a personal quirk of yours and doesn't drag others towards you, but in the latter case everyone just goes "oh that's a thing that we're saying now" and unconsciously shifts towards you

Yesterday was *definitely* the last bullshit appointment i've turned up to at the other locale

The fat retard didn't even wait for me at the entrance either as we had arranged, then when i went in by mself the fucking thing was packed with assorted pakis as well and stuff

Best part though was when this semi-retarded fat hideous middle-aged woman that was supposed to give me some information on [redacted] came running in like five or six times within a span of less than 10 minutes; Bitch just kept running in and out of the office like a 6 year old that just OD'd on ritalin or sommet, shit was extremely irritating and unsettling. 

Then the fucking phone in there kept ringing every other minute too. I had to actually tell the guy that her behaviour was making me hugely uncomfortable for him to tell her to cut it out. 

Before the bitch finally settled down properly and started talking in earnest i had to spend another solid 20 minutes or sommet watching the fat retard scroll through random shit on his screen since he was (again, just like at the other office earlier) too stupid to print out my doc which he had just scanned. These people are all incompetent morons squatting on state-subsidized meme positions.

Hugely frustrating waste of time overall, it's extremely fucking unlikely i'll be turning up there again next month lol
--- 73031831
>>73031747
I'm tempted to message her just to see if it's the same copy/paste reply

Realizef today I look VERY VERY good with buzzcut and stubble / beard. My facial hair just has to grow out a bit morr fuller to complete this. Also good omen for when I start going bald because I know I will look damn good still If I keep looking after myself and not go nutz on booze and junk food like HHL.

I genuinely would give myself an 8.5 out of 10. Sadly it probably cannot truly make up for the fact of my sub-standard height.
--- 73032036
It my world. You're just living in it x
Cheers x
--- 73032048

>De lids... why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night I can feel my leg and my arm... even my fingers... the 90's I've lost... the raves I've lost... won't stop hurting. It's like they're all still there. You feel it too, don't you? I'm the one who got caught up with the Dorset County Council. A council above stores, even Greggs. And I was the parasite below, feeding off the council's power. They came after us in /bant/... then /britfeel/... the council... just keeps growing. Swallowing everything in its path. Getting bigger and bigger... Who knows how big now? My lids, I'm gonna make 'em give back our neetbux... take back every drink that we've lost. And I won't rest... until we do.

Holy shit lads! Holy shit. I was about the mop the floor and leave but I realized instead of the regular mops we had these new dogshite ones that make it so much harder. I thought I had missed the bus and had to wait in the pissing cold with wet wollocks. 

But when I walked to the bus stop I saw the last one driving up so I pumped me little legs as hard as I could and I actually got it. No overpriced taxi bollocks.

GET IN! GET IN! GET IIIIN!!

Poleaboo is still here, sometimes. But the overall quality of absolutely everything is much, much worse and you'd do better to remain blissfully ignorant. And no we don't get new OP images, we use random towns and sometimes a seethy image.

Hmm not tried it for 4 years or so, maybe I'll give it a go. I bloomin love regular Coca Cola though, but I'm also getting old and want to keep my teeth so I've cut it right back. Still best feeling ever drinking after eating something incredibly salty/fatty though.

Right. Let's sort the buyers from the spyers, the needy from the greedy, and those who trust me from the ones who don't, because if you can't see value here today, you're not up here shopping. You're up here shoplifting. You see these goods? Never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite. Fanny by the gaslight. Take a bag, c'mon take a bag. I took a bag home last night. Cost me a lot more than ten pound, I can tell you. Anyone like jewelry? Look at that one there. Handmade in Italy, hand-stolen in Stepney. It's as long as my arm. I wish it was as long as something else. Don't think because these boxes are sealed up, they're empty. The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you lot today, I'd make more money with me measuring tape. Here, one price. Ten pound

quickly popping in to say I hope my lovely lads are happy and smiling and I shaaaaant be drinking or posting here this weekend

GOON MORNING LADS

Really fiending for the goon today, even considering calling in sick so I don't even have to pay the minimal amount of attention to my wfh (wank from home) job and I can FULLY focus on gooning.

Goon content today is gonna be mostly babecocks. Absolutely melts my brain when watching them with poppers and listening to goon audios.

We still have it, it's just we also have gay marriage. Instead: abolish gay marriage and straight couples get tax cuts which increase over time to reward long-term stable families. Also make infidelity a crime which brings hefty fines and community service hours while wearing a sign that says "I was an unfaithful spouse" or something.
>benefits only for those that need it
Not a fan of this - technically the welfare system we have now is for 'those that need it' yet it's obviously not the case. Needs to be way tougher.
>schools are to be places of education
Yep, though education should be something closer to the trivium, with clearly able students offered additional education and those that aren't able being tracked into apprenticeships
>doctors given proper training
They are given proper training already, it's just that the BMA places a cap on the number of doctors/nurses that unis are allowed to train per year. Literal insanity, the BMA must be disbanded and unis allowed to open placements to as many candidates as they want
>abolish 90% of universities in favour of apprenticeships
Yep. Keep any degrees that are basically technical trade on-boardings and disband the rest. Seize the endowments and the properties.
>get Britain reading again. If you read 25 books you get a boost to your benefits/a tax cut
Kinda gimmicky and unenforceable. Universal literacy is neither achievable or, frankly, desirable.

Why is it mental? Plenty of countries and societies had infidelity as a crime for hundreds of years. Cheating ruins marriages and families and is a generally horrifically immoral thing to do, so why not punish it and deter people at the same time? Social shaming is very effective to prevent recidivism - see Singaporean child weight loss programs.

Yeah that was a great one. They took it down because brazzers is a big company and didn't want the hassle of the Pornstar Punishment scenes being seen as 'too rough' and get the site shut down. However you can still find complete siterips of it online. Have a few scenes tucked away somewhere. 
You remember when brazzers teased a scene called 'Romains of the Day'? It was Sandra and Alice Romain, the sisters, in an anal threesome with Danny D in the back of a limo, but the scene never got released because the brazzers management thought it pushed the boundary into incest too far. My god to get my hands on that scene...

Oh yeah I've been on pornolab for years now, but no luck. I legit think they just deleted the master copy to avoid any issues. Was very unhappy when brazzers nuked their own site. A full third of their videos or something got taken down for not much reason, it's not like some scene that's a decade old is suddenly gonna get the police knocking at their offices or anything.

I think they're in a bit of a rut right now anyway, only a few scenes from them pique my interest now and a lot of the best stars currently active don't get work with them. I remember back in sort of the early to mid 2010s when they'd get tons of proper A-listers doing multiple scenes a month for them. Shame how it's a bit stale now with unimpressive talent.

The gold-digging gf escalated her sneakyarse schemes to a considerable degree again out of the blue earlier while on call too; This is one of the topics she was more or less fixated on since the beginning. Hillariously enough she denies being a golddigger too of course. Says she doesn't want to "lose her standard of living" or whatever - I'm like bitch please, you live in one of the continent's poorest cunts by far and your "job" consists of logging into some meme gig economy app on the reg and LARPing as a [redacted] on there. 

But these deluded wahminoids always think they have to monkeybranch and/or cheat after a while, in order "to do better" - Until their SMV finally runs out completely and it's too late for them/only the lowest quality bottom of the barrel-type men show interest in them. 

She even lampshaded the whole cat lady thing too and then went full schizo saying that "God perhaps doesn't want me to have a partner/become a mother so i can be more spiritual"... Like yeah, you keep coping and telling yourself that and see how your golddigging and chadfishing works out for you 5 years or so from now when you're nearing your 40s lmao. The bitch has issues with getting pregnant and is already hitting the wall even now, it sure as hell won't get any easier for her down the line.

Anyways she then finally got around and said that she'll """need more time""" to ascertain whether a long distance relationshit with regular week-long meetups once a month would work for her or not after all. Told her to think long and hard about it before making her choice and what have you. 

But eh, there's a 98,5% chance it'll crash and burn thanks to her shit now/when i get up again and check back later for one last time. Mentally i've "closed the file" already as it were and am ready to move on, just waiting on the formal confirmation now.

Still glad i saw this thing thru though; Really really had to get me schwong wet again after all this time. And wet it has gotten...

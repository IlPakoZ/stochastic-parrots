Is it ok to just go to another church? I do not know anyone there, how would I even talk to girls there

I heard the fighters guild is recruiting, not a bad way to make money, if youve got the stones for it

Young women rarely go to church and when they do, they already have boyfriends, have a repulsive turbo-bible-thumping personality, and are always very cliquey. Just avoid Christian women unless you're devout yourself. Too much trouble.

Mostly with your mouth and body language. It's easy to meet girls at church or social events.

Yes I recommend it too, visiting other parishes and denominations is nice. Also be sure to visit your church regularly, because young people usually aren't able to attend church all the time so you don't miss a person. I think some churches also have programs for coupling singles. If you really can't find anyone there are Christian dating sites online.

How many days of nofap should it take to lose a cuck fetish because I can't live with a brain like this anymore.
--- 73099523
>>73099494 (OP)
Usually the sources of such fetishes are self hatred. You need to start loving yourself more and your masochism will fade.
--- 73099630
>>73099523
That's easier said than done, anon

90 days is the standard to get rid of a fetish with nofap, but take the NTS pill instead.

Just get a gf who's into open relationships. It's not the most respectable sexual need but at least you aren't gay or a tranny and can just call her your gf when talking to friends or coworkers.

I wouldnt mine having a cuck bf as long as he doesnt force the BBC think on me cause I dont really find black guys attractive.
--- 73099763
>>73099707
I think OP should meet someone like you.
Almost zero guys would be OK with a girlfriend having sex with other men and a lot of girls want to have casual sex with other men while still having a bf.
So if nothing else, being into getting cuckes makes it really easy to get a gf.

>gf who's into open relationships
>you.. can just call her your gf
Don't you mean "our gf", comrade?

And I'm not just cracking a joke.
There were&amp;are socialists&amp;communists who made a case that monogamy was incompatible with Communism.
Basically Brave New World shit.

Where it leads to can be seen in early days of USSR where partner swapping and orgies (along other degen shit) were on the rise.
So were single motherhoods and STDs... for some mysterious reason.
Last drop when even Party decided that this shit has gone too far was very loud case of one virgin girl refusing to partake in an orgy and was forcefully dragged into it and gangraped. To add insult to injury she got several STDs from that.

That's why I don't like modern western encouragement of sexual degeneracy- I've seen this movie before and I know how it ends.

I'm not the one with a cuck fetish, friend.
Personally if a gf of mine asked me about opening up our relationship I would never talk to her or see again and would possibly also kill myself.
But if that's your sexual orientation or preference to have a gf who cucks you with other men then you might as well live your life and get a gf like that.
For STDs you can do rapid result testing now and probably should encourage her to do that so you can both stay safe.

God I love Marin. But I don't want to, anon I want a normal male sexuality. >>73099700
It's one of the least respectable sexual needs I don't think I could live with the shame of being in an "open relationship"
>>73099707
I don't get the BBC thing either it just needs to be bigger than mine, race doesn't really come into it for me. And bigger than mine leaves a lot of guys available because I have a 4 in her
>>73099763
Most girls wouldn't date a cuck, dating one is probably nearly as embarrassing as being one. They definitely wouldn't stay attracted to him post cucking
>>73099809
I agree with you it's disgusting and degenerate anon, post nut I usually feel like killing myself

I'd stop right now, then.
NTR/cuckstuff is extremely addictive and it will snowball hard if you keep engaging in it. Neuroplasticity of the brain is extremely fragile and will mold itself to what you like, you don't want this.
--- 73100071
>>73099872
>Most girls wouldn't date a cuck
You're very wrong.
Lots of girls want open relationships and either cheat or just suppress their urges because they know almost every guy on Earth hates the idea of being cucked.
If you're actively into getting an open relationship you can get a gf very easily and not even need to be attractive or confident or anything (most cucks are not attractive and are not confident).
Just by being willing to fulfill the bf role and also willing to let your gf have casual hookups with other guys you'd be opening up the door to lots of prospective gf options.
This is probably the easiest way for any guy to get a gf and the only reason most guys don't do that is because they don't want to be cucks. If you're actually into being a cuck you're stupid if you don't take advantage of it in getting an easy gf.
--- 73100135
>>73100071
You're probably right but the personal pleasure I would get from being a cuck doesn't out weigh the shame and disappointment in myself I'd feel so i don't really want to be a cuck 
>>73100034
Good advice but I'm pretty deep in the hole already I've been engaging with cuck content for a little over half a decade now, my brain is molded
--- 73100147

that's a self-esteem problem first and foremost, and lack of you being your own father figure to yourself
go individuate as per Jung, search it up, it will end up addressing your problems directly if you willl follow it through
--- 73100148
>>73100135
>shame and disappointment
That's usually what makes any fetishes hot. If you don't want to want it that makes it even more powerful.
Similar idea to women having a shameful fetish for being raped or men having a shameful fetish for crossdressing.
--- 73100159
>>73100148
maybe the right mindset for OP
"this is nothing to be ashamed of but I just don't like it and it can be addressed"
--- 73100193
>>73099494 (OP)
y'know, maybe it will help you to understand that it's pretty entitled to think you're the victim in (imagined) cuckold scenarios so it's delusional to fetishise yourself "being put into your place"
everyone loses in there, it's a collective rotting pit
in reality all involved parties partake in hedonistic psyche-corroding decay that leaves them unable to ever be in a meaningful long-lasting relationship, leading to malformations of society and community they are in - just by accumulation of such short-term hedonistic behaviors, collapsing underneath anyone who didn't leave before it was too late
--- 73101063

This is true but its hard to not be ashamed of something so taboo and ridiculed

what's the point of the looking at it from the scope of shame? you're your own man, not a pawn to society
deal with what you don't like in yourself - on your own, with your own head

Netorase. It's basically the hentai term for cuckolding. NTR is getting cheated on NTS is willingly getting cucked
--- 73101119
>>73099494 (OP)
Nothing wrong with NTR.
--- 73101146
>>73101107
That's true. I guess my biggest problem with it is more fear of others seeing me as a cuck rather than any fear of being a cuck. 
>>73101119
There's a lot wrong with ntr

How do you think you got this fetish ?

For me I was cheated on and my ex sent me the vids of her fucking and it turned me on
--- 73101262
>>73101245
>How do you think you got this fetish ?
not op but as far as I've been studying this for fun - for destructive fetishes the answers are neuroses, psychoses or trauma

Shit that's terrible. I think it's hot obviously but still that's rough. I don't really have an origin story like that it was just a domino effect of liking small penis humiliation because I've always been smaller than my peers in most ways including my penis so I was insecure about small size= unmasculine. >>73101271
I dunno if it'd do us any good but if you drop a tag I'll add you ig

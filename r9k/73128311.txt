I would want to share experiences with other people that have this. 

As far as I know this doesn't have a cure. You just have to live with it. Maybe if you lower your anxiety you can decrease the intensity of the obsessions but they never disappear completely.

Another thing that I have realized is that when one obsession seems to calm down and you don't think so much about it, then a new obsession appears with all the strength. This is really fucked up. I will be forever obsessed with this or that, no matter what I do because if I manage to reduce one of the obsessions another one will appear and the cycle will continue until the day I die. 

Since the moment that I wake up until the moment I fall asleep I'm thinking about this or that obsession.

Because of all that I feel that my life has no fucking sense. There is no sense in living with a broken mind like this.

I have ocd too and you can cure it if you pinpoint what causes this. All hope is not lost.

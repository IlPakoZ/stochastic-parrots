I overheard my female co-workers talking about the men they've liked. It appears that al the men they've been attracted to were, quote, "very tall and cute". And then I realized one thing: it's over if you are a manlet. I am 5'9" ( barefoot, no shoes) and feel small. No wonder women do not notice me. 
Fellow manlets, what do you do? Have you accepted the gruesome and unforgiven reality that we are Untermensch and should not reproduce?

If short women want more tall men in society then they should start fucking male giraffes

I dont like overly tall men. For a number of reasons. I find tall guys to be kind of arrogant. They seem to use their height as a personality substitute. I also dislike long legs on men. I think it looks womanly. And I like stocky men. Tall guys tend to be ectomorphs with breadstick limbs. My biggest crushes in life were 5ft7 and 5ft10 respectively.

Manlet's hands typed it.
--- 73054578
it's true that most women prefer men who are at least taller than them, but that doesn't mean you should lose all hope. i've had 3 boyfriends throughout my life and they were 5'10", 5'6", and 5'7". one of my close guy friends is 5'2" and has been with his girlfriend for over a year now. no, she's not fat or ugly. yes, she is slightly taller than him. don't give up anon.
--- 73055634
Just transition if you're below 5'6, don't kill yourself, you'll become pwetty pwincesses and help your fellow incels lose their virginity.
--- 73055670
>>73055634
>below 5'6
>not 6'10
lmao so funny seeing manlets eat their own
--- 73055680
>>73054290 (OP)
If it's any consolation, I'm 6'4 and a 31-year-old virgin. Your face makes or breaks you.

this must be the wrongest thing i've ever ever read on this board

Iunno 6'10 tall women would make me kinda uncomfortable tbdesu, if you're into that i guess good on you lmao.

What do they mean by cute?
--- 73055768
My bf is 5'6 and I think he's hotter than my ex who was 6'0!

> t. manlet pretending to be a female
--- 73055802
>>73054439
I appreciate this response. Tall being a personality substitute, like it's some kind of accomplishment. I also wondered that like do women really prefer say a 6'2" guy that doesn't even weigh 200lbs. What kind of feeling of protection does that provide?
--- 73055803
>>73054290 (OP)
You're 5,9 and get no women?

Fuck
--- 73055814
I think this particular six feet thing is US-only.
This is 182.8cm, completely meaningless number to the rest of the world, I just just "six" is not "five" and the monkey brain activates the one female neuron.
--- 73055816

I'm 6'2 with a healthy bmi I'm yet to experience the magic pussy magnet powers you all worship.
--- 73055829
>>73055816
Does your face look like the Ukrainians just hit it with a HIMARS?
If that is also not the case, you are either absurdly shy or are some psycho that women run away from.
--- 73055855
>>73055816
Wow it's almost as if even though being tall surely helps, it by no means won't get you a gf automatically.

For real guys, my bf is like 5'4 and he conquered me by being kind, caring, fun, and dominating the fuck out of me.
--- 73055868
>>73055829
I think I have a pretty average face maybe slightly on the lower side but still masculine. I wouldn't really describe myself as explicitly shy either since I have done some public speaking and am not so autistic that I cant talk to women. I won't lie it certainly doesn't hurt being tall but I've only ever had one woman take an interest in me which I know is more than most can say around here but the point is the height is hardly a pussy magnet.
--- 73055890
>>73055855
yeah pretty much if woman doesn't want you solely based on your height she was probably going to be a shit partner in the first place.
--- 73055915
My gf doesn't seem to mind my height
--- 73055944
>>73054290 (OP)
My bf is only 5'7" and has fucked more girls than you've probably ever even talked to. I'm not denying that being short is a disadvantage as a man, but that can't be your only problem.
--- 73055967
>>73055944
The manlet meme is just a cope for any guy who isnt severely under the average height. The problem is almost always looks or personality.
--- 73056016
>>73055868
As a 172cm man I can't relate. Been alone for 15 years and counting, age 35 now.
I would recommend you go to hobby places, especially dancing and nerd stuff like DnD, most of my friends got gfs and wives through interests, nobody through online dating.
--- 73056035
>>73055890
Yeah, it's still something women look for obviously, but i feel like it isn't THAT impactful, like, of you literally find the man of your life, but they're 5'10 instead of being 6'0, are you really going to leave them exclusively because of that? No sane person'd say yes.
--- 73056105

Manlet coping on le 4chan again.>>73055915
she doesn't mind but as soon as a guy equal to you and taller comes along its over and shes on his cock!
--- 73056114
>>73055944
>>73055967
Nope studies prove you manlets are fucking not human and undesirable. your "boyfriend" is a little twink and I could snap him in half if I had to.
--- 73056142
>>73056114
>your "boyfriend" is a little twink and I could snap him in half if I had to.
I'm sure that weighs heavily on his mind when he's ball-deep in a warm pussy.
--- 73056197
>>73056114
Im not a manlet I just think assuming all your dating problems are the result of being 5'9" instead of 6'0 is a retarded cope
--- 73056210
>>73056197
No, you're a manlet, I love pushing you little fucks around irl. Hope you never run into me but im sure other real men do all the time.
--- 73056242
>>73056210
Ohhhhhh who's an edgy boy? Who's an edgy boy?! Who's my edgy boy?
--- 73056254
>>73056242
If you said that to me irl I would beat your little ass into a fucking pulp LMAO do NOT try me mini man.
--- 73056271

Im probably taller than you. You retarded leprechaun.

PhD graduate in Manletology here

If you try to compete with tall men in their playing field (i.e. online dating &amp; clubbing) you will be playing a very tough away game.

When women only have physical features to judge on then height will always filter out manlets

Imagine being a girl and having like 1000 random dudes in your DMs. You will need some metric to just narrow it down. 

HOWEVER, note that women are not attracted to us the same way we are attracted to them. Women have a VERY big emotional aspect to their falling in love.

What does this mean? It means that as a manlet if you manage to trigger that emotional connection with a girl, which could be just doing something thoughtful in the right way at the right time, then you circumvent the heightfilter

THE PROBLEM is that this is not possible in night clubs, online dating etc so physical features (i.e. height) will always win.

THE SOLUTION is ironically enough to have good male friends that are perhaps more sociable. They will then include you in friend groups, social events (going camping, traveling, cabin weekends etc.). In these social events there will also be single girls, who are friends of friends. In these settings the height filter is not applied. NOTE: in these settings the height filter is not applied. You are no longer in the club or on tinder, so now you can just talk to them now and then saying hi and being friendly without simping. Then eventually you will get your chance. Maybe X girl will sleep in your tent or your sleeping bed because her friend is going to her boyfriend and she doesnt want to be alone. This is where you then talk together at night or you get her a warm tea in the morning because she had a sore throat, or give her a ride home.

This will spark the emotional attraction and then from here you have unlocked the dating phase.

The frequency of chances you get will depend on the quality of your male friends

I dated a girl for 6 months and we almost got married until a new tall guy started working at my job and she left me right away for him

Emotional connection is retard shit lol

--- 73056528
OP 5'9" manlet here
>>73055634
> transition 
Shoulders are way too broad, unironically. Probably, the only thing which is good about my physique. 
>>73055749
Attractive face, I think.
>>73055803
But 5'9" is a manlet height. Not just in the US.
>>73055816
Maybe you ugly

And I see a lot of manlet cope here. Do not cope. Just admit we lost the genetic lottery and move on.
--- 73056542
>>73056528
Im op and im 6'3 you fucking coping larping manlet faggot tranzoid
--- 73056544
>>73056460
How can you be sure the height is what did it though? Did she say so herself?
--- 73056556
>>73056528
Nah you just need 1 disadvantage to blame your own failings on because your personality cant admit it might be the issue kek
--- 73056590
>>73056285
>In these social events there will also be single girls, who are friends of friends.

This used to happen a lot, but now this is much less frequent. It still happens, sure, but the problem is that the online world hovers over the IRL world now.

That "single girl who is a friend of a friend" used to be bored and hoping to meet someone. So you could be at this "social event" and make your impression and pay attention to her and she might be into it.

But in the current year, the whole time you are trying to talk to this "single girl who is a friend of a friend" her phone is vibrating with texts from the 20 guys trying to talk to her. She isn't waiting for someone to pay attention to her when she arrives at the event; she's SICK of attention.

A woman having a phone is like a guy having a sexbot. That's how big the change has been. Your information isn't 100% false and will still work...sometimes. But your information is OLD, and it's aging fast. It will soon be just another "boomer story", like working your way through college by lifeguarding in the summer, or buying a house right when you get out of school.

Well, on my uni the body isn't even enough, i am at "Universidad de Lima" in Peru and a guy i know as a friend asked in spanish "Face or body (cara o cuerpo)?" The girls said face...all of them. https://youtu.be/gwV3zGcOw4Q [Embed]

This one gets it. Internet dating is when one Chad fucks 10 women. And women do not mind btw. They prefer sharing Chads that's for sure.
--- 73056657
>>73056590
You are partially correct but according to my research into manletology the attention they get from Phone will not match up to real IRL emotional moments with boys.

Where I believe you are correct is that it happens a lot more rare to actually meet up IRL in these social gatherings. But I still believe an emotional moment shared IRL the Phone spam will not be able to match.
--- 73056675
>>73056528
>Maybe you ugly
 
If ugliness is my sole problem does that not just prove the whole manlet cope is nothing but a meme
--- 73056746
Why are mantlets so vicious and insecure to eachother? No other topic do hostile retards lunge out of the woodworks to schizo you into being their bogeyman.

Bunch of future school shooters man.
--- 73056813
>>73056746
Chads and Tyrone are vicious to each other, at their peer level. It's about intimidation and competition. Us manlets do not compete against Chadeus Tyronicus. We compete against each other.

I don't like ethnonationalism or the state of Israel or its actions, though I do understand the original intention of wanting a Jewish state for security reasons. I just don't think they have a right to take other people's land or oppress people in the process.

I really don't like this framing of some group being better or worse than others, personally. I think I'm probably smart when it comes to certain things, though, yeah.

>>73032552
Physicalism is just common sense.

I don't like right-wing ideology and definitely don't like right-wing Jews.

What are your general thoughts on white people? Do you consider yourself white?

>What are your general thoughts on white people?
Same as my thoughts on any other people.

>Do you consider yourself white?
99.9% of people IRL treat me that way, so, in practice, I guess. Only far-right people in America don't treat Jews as white. Any Jew who grows up in America will consider themselves white; just with "(Ashkenazi) Jewish" as a kind of subtype of white. I find these kinds of things pretty silly in general, though. I'm very much in the "I don't see race" camp.

There's little point to doing anything anymore. The FBI ruined my life. They may ruin yours too if you continue to post here or, probably, elsewhere on 4chan too. I sadly can't go into details because 4chan isn't actually anonymous, but I can say they are worse than your worst expectations.

just keep your autismo to yourself weirdo

they already know everything, won't change a thing if they do something about it. As long as I don't end up in jail I should be fine

I go to 4chan to do the exact opposite of that. Why would I care what the literal who that is you thinks of my post?

They didn't put me in jail, yet at least. I've not committed any crimes, but they operate on a guilty until proven innocent mindset which led to them being involved with me. The problem arose when I found out and didn't know what to do

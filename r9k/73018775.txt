So Ive done a little experimenting with the differences between the models, here's my basic understanding of them and what happens by default with basic prompts 
Anything: more realistic style, sharper lines but with high detail in the shading. Brightly sunlit photos. Can produce very good nudity but is finicky about doing so compared to the others. It takes a little longer to generate too but if prompted to not produce nightmares makes very high quality waifus.
AOM3: The smuttiest by far, by default will produce sluts in lingerie partially nude. Can produce less smutty situations well too, but seems to be only able to focus on one or the other. You get detailed backgrounds or detailed waifus in most. Lighting is usually complex with light and dark parts drawing your eye. Bests the others in it's response to specifics and generating multiple waifus without major anatomy issues.
Counterfeit: The comfiest. By default prefers to produce scenery (pic related). Highly detailed with multiple recognizable objects. When prompted with just "girl" she is in beautiful clothes sitting in the highly detailed backgrounds sometimes interacting with the objects in it. Warm colors and lighting add to the "comfy" factor. Can produce ok nudity but has certain weird traits like missing assholes, best at vouyer for expressions and poses.

It's getting chilly in this dumping ground for industrial waste and byproducts

Nice melting
--- 73019085
Imagine you're on the end of the world.
Everything is dissolving. You have like 25 minutes before dying. 
And she's the last thing you see.

>"I'll let you motorboat these if you don't."

OK Saeriah, I won't. I would just feel bad for prompting that stuff anyway.
--- 73019390
>>73019368
If she were to be genned in the oil her titties would motorfloat

No wings, but the colors are pretty neat

I'm trying to gen someone new right now. 
But here's a Horny to not let you alone.
--- 73021370
can anyone help me get started with prompts im new
--- 73021501
>>73021370
What's your doubt? 
Enter here https://waifus.nemusona.com/, since Goa anon forgot. It has some simple instructions to get you started. 
In general, start simple. Try to get the girl you want first, later you try poses, and other stuff.
--- 73021520
>>73021501
i typed some stuff in but it is difficult to control :( thank you for the websit
--- 73021530
>>73021370
Use tags from Danbooru, there's a guide on the website itself under the "Prompting info" menu. As for which model to use an anon has written a summary on all 3 of them right here >>73018834

In general just start simple first eg. hair color, eye color, booba size, hair length, clothing. Once you get it down you can try adding other stuff like the setting, background, art style etc. For simplicity sake you can just leave CFG and Denoise in the center if you want to
--- 73021541
>>73021530
ok tank you!
--- 73021693
There's nothing I'm doing to change these but I keep making them. 

>>73021223
>>73021224
Based, thanks! Nice mecha cockpit and cosmic spiderweb dress.

>>73021370
In general, type in the things you want to see and they'll appear. If you use danbooru tags, it works a bit better. For instance, the prompts I'm using for this one are: 

(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed, ((Isuzu Hana)), ((Isuzu Hana Girls und Panzer)), (sugimoto isao style), black hair, long hair, ((ahoge)), (swept bangs), (hair between eyes), (black eyes), ((smile)), (medium breasts), (((Fallout New Vegas))), ((((cowboy outfit)))), ((((holster)))), (((ammo belt))), ((((ornate poncho)))), ((((ornate sombrero)))), ((long pants)), ((((holding futuristic gun)))), ((((desert)))), (((((Las Vegas Strip))))), (((Space Needle))), ((Bellagio Hotel Las Vegas))
--- 73021727
>>73021224
I wanna feedback on this. I feel like she's lacking something yet...
>>73021693
Also, I'm making use of some of your prompts. Thank you
--- 73021746
>>73021693
thanks! but i dont really understand the ((( stuff
--- 73021759
>>73021746
It's for emphasis on what you want. Use it if some prompt start to disappear in middle of stuff. For now, just try to make the girl you want by now.
--- 73021768
>>73021759
oh interesting i am making good progress thank you for the explanation
--- 73021792
Am I crazy or does this look like the actual 9mm pistol from the game?

>>73021727
Go ahead and use whatever you like! If you want to make it a bit more interesting, use "dynamic pose"

>>73021746
>>73021759
What he said. So for instance, "Space Needle" and "Bellagio Hotel Las Vegas" have three brackets, so I really want them to appear. But "desert" has four so I want that to appear more.
--- 73021837
>>73021792

--- 73021878

Very well. The general idea is okay. Let's start genning for real beforing thinking on a backstory.
To cockpit we go
--- 73021935
>>73021878
cockpit is gonna need some expansion work from all the waifus you have to fit in it
--- 73021945
Huh... I can already see that I'll have problems with the hat.
--- 73021956
>>73021935
If my cockpit survived a star and a sandstorm, it can resist anything.
--- 73021964

--- 73022223
>>73021956
>>73022161
whoa these backgrounds look really nice :O what prompts are you using for them?
--- 73022252
>>73022223
Unironically none. I'm just running a different model and that just throws a background when I don't specify any.

And there's it. Cockpit.
--- 73022267
Bang, you die now

>>73022161
The AI is very horny, try "long skirt"
--- 73022296
>>73022267
That's my strongest prompt. She just want to be too lewd.
--- 73022352
Will I have to add a pantyhose on you too, so?
--- 73022439
Man I can consistently get ANYTHING to fire but the gun. I got gunfire to come out of a power line lol.

Celebratory post. I just got a new video card! Hopefully I'll show up more often, assuming I stop sucking at prompt writing and have some more ideas. Or maybe at least I'll post higher-res things when I do come here. Pour one out for the Vega 56 that I'm retiring, she gave me some good years of service.

Try using these, ((((magic)))), ((((energy)))), (fantasy), (((light particles))), (((aura))), ((((casting spell)))), then you can add things like fire/burning/embers or ice/iceberg/snow etc. to cast specific things.

Goa watching me add a tea bag of english breakfast tea into the pot where I am boiling some sausages because I am experimenting with cooking again

End result, not bad, but i can't really tell if it's because the sausages are really good with or without being boiled in tea, or if the tea made any difference. Need further testing

Do women actually want switches, or is it just a pipedream? 

95% of women are submissive and I feel like most of them don't want the slightest indication that their man might be submissive in anyway at all. When it comes to dom women it's a shitshow since there's a 5:1 ratio of sub men: dom women, so they can cherrypick all the guys with the lowest self esteem who are willing to bend over backwards for them in every which way. Should I just lean into my dom side, or are there actually women who want switches?

I assume youre sub leaning switch? Dom women dont pick mean that will bend over backwards for them, just like the rest, they will pick the best looking one. Actually dominant women dont want a cuck that will follow her every order.

Statistics on relationships are pretty much worthless since so many people lie. But even if your statistic was 100% correct, single doesn't mean not having sex

I disagree, but whichever is true I'm not in the top 20% of submissiveness or looks so it doesn't matter either way.

What are you even trying to say here? Also single doesn't mean they aren't seeing anyone. Girls will have two different flings over the course of six months and consider themselves single that entire time. Women cannot comprehend the loneliness many men feel.

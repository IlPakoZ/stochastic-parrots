I wish I was young again, I had false hopes and was less concerned with things but at least I was happier.

A lesson for you: Have low expectations and be ready for any kind of disaster. Your life however is pretty much over if you get into an accident and become paralyzed, blind, deaf, etc. Trying is also not always pointless because sometimes you don't know you can accomplish something unless you try. Avoid being both a naive optimist and naive pessimist, and don't expect anything handed to you.

OP is Retard san, an AMAB MTF boymoder described as a cute girl with long beautiful hair and deep knowledge of WW2 and Resident Evil. She is purportedly very intelligent despite occasionally sleeping through her college classes. 


Following male puberty, Retard san began her HRT journey at age 18 and has now passed the 4 year mark.

Retard san usually makes threads sharing the romantic story of how she met her soul mate, Tranny kun, on r9k in order to give hope to other true robots like herself. Tranny kun reciprocates by dedicating threads to his r9k gf.

Tranny kun is a bisexual chaseoid who crusades on behalf of true robots, defending their board from normalfags despite never claiming the robot identity for himself. He regularly wins 20v1 arguments against r9k users which is why a small subset of them invented the meme about him crumbling under scrutiny.

Some have argued that their relationship is performative or unhealthy due to Tranny kun regularly prompting Retard san to make these threads about him or because he invalidated her lived experience as a lonely trubot but that criticism most likely stems from jealousy as Tranny kun has humblebragged about Retard san planning to dress as a maid and wear black lingerie for him when they meet at Retard san's grandparents for the next chapter of their love story. He flatly denies any suggestion that Retard san's visit to his parents caused any shock or embarrassment and no diapers were found by his mother afterwards.

The next chapter of their romance will be a romantic getaway to Retard san's grandmother's home. At present, Retard san is not 'out' to her Catholic grandparents who therefore will not be respecting Retard san's preferred pronouns and will be using her birth name (known as deadnaming). Luckily, the language barrier should prevent any embarrassing confrontations over this for the duration of the visit

You should change your hateful ways and get a cute trans gf, my bf was a chud and I reformed him and now he's in a happy relationship, we are inspiring you to bet better.
--- 73102409
>>73102350
You are fucking scum and nothing more. The fact you're here proves you were ostracized by your own kind so you come to this board which is known for incels to put yourself above others. And if you're really in Mexico, I hope the cartels find you, slit your throats and chop off your fucking heads.
--- 73102421
>>73102409
I can already tell by your post that you long for a cute trans gf to cuddle with, you can't fool me. Don't be so bitter, maybe one day you'll have a trans cutie in your life and stop being so bigoted

You guys Tranny-kun and Retard-san were face revealed yesterday and it's as bad as you think

It's literslly Tranny kun or the retard selfposting that you dumb cunt.

Notice it's all praise and not a single negative thing? I swear you idiots are so fucking stupid. You're probably the tranny himself. Fuck all of you.

Shut the fuck up ugly pedo fuck. I notice you called for backup from your equally repulsive tranny partner when the thread got heated. Absolute parasites
--- 73102751
>>73102589
So far Retard san seems to have stronger critical thinking. Tranny kun appears to be confused by an entirely unrelated post. Is that what anons expected?
--- 73102776
>>73102739
Who is the trans partner? I'm a cis man.
>>73102751
Sorry I was defensive. I have no idea if they're the same.
--- 73102831
>>73102702
They're just trying to bait you into faceposting because they know you're too ugly and insecure to do so otherwise

--- 73103334
>>73102831
It is highly unlikely Retard san will ever face reveal. Here is my reasoning:

i HRT after puberty means a significantly reduced likelihood of "passing" and this is a subject both Tranny kun and Retard san have displayed some sensitivity over in the past
ii Retard san's cuteness and femininity has been emphasized and built up over a long period of time. Any perceived deviation from this high standard will obviously be judged particularly harshly and will make her a figure of ridicule
iii Any face reveal is guaranteed to be reposted many, many times as Retard san and Tranny kun are now almost as famous as vore and ENTJ were in their heyday, perhaps even at the level of Limes and Erica. This could adversely affect the career prospects of two well educated geniuses.

My mother has never been in my life. That was a person I talked to online for several months. I have never known my mother or father. I licked the soap because that person said if I didnt they would leave.
--- 73103445
>>73103402
You licked the soap because you are retarded, buddy. Non retards would do this
> No, licking soap would be unpleasant so I won't do that. Further, I think it would be best if I spent my time with someone who didn't ask me to do harmful or unpleasant things.

Repeatedly making obviously stupid, maladaptive choices is a strong indicator that you are retarded. Have you thought about pursuing some sort of special education program aimed at adult retards?

what was the point of this post? genuinely. Our lives are so radically different your opinion means nothing to me.

Then why not just post face to unsee? If you're secure about your appearance no consequence of that could meaningfully affect you
--- 73103540

also true, its not like they have posted anything that would get them in serious trouble they just spam annoying threads. Maybe theyd be embarrassed in their large friend groups (normalfags)

Also my point was that you obviously see I am continuing to be retarded despite you replying that to me frequently, so your replies are affecting no meaningful change, so why do you keep posting them. do you have a crush on me

Doesn't refute what I said. No one can do anything with a facedox except make fun of you and you know it. And if you were genuinely "cute" (even just by MtF standards) anons mocking would simply look envious of your wholesome robot relationship

There is no upside to a face reveal and many potential downsides. From the limited knowledge we have on the couple, retard san is actually the smart one so she will have weighed up the pros and cons.

They're the kind of fags who pretend they didn't lose when in reality they did. Very nice.

If you win almost every argument that means you are an idiot, not intelligent.
>>73104420
npd people tend to do that, yeah.

Hey, I have someone you wont win against.

Retard-san and especially Tranny-kun are vulnerable narcissists like picrel, quite neurotic also
--- 73104457

Who won't I win against?

Meme buzzword and I deal with lots of criticism here just fine. I hate being harassed for my appearance, dough.
--- 73104467
>>73104438
true.
>>73104457
I can give you their contact if they post again, they are more confident they are right than you are. Would be like watching two unstoppable forces run into each other and would make me laugh.

my bf isnt a narcissist, he's a super sweet boy. When I stayed over at his house, I asked him to make tea for me and he would do it and be happy to make me happy. And also, he gives me backrubbies. Is that what a narcissist would do? I think not
--- 73104507
>>73104487
Narcissistic people can actually be incredibly sweet and charming when luring someone in. even for months at a time. They arent addictive to interact with because they just treat you like shit. You clearly know little to nothing about the disorder to assert that as a refutation of the claim.
--- 73104514
>>73104467
What's the topic to debate
>>73104507
What proves the narcissism then?
--- 73104531
>>73104403
lmao at them getting their larps all mixed up
--- 73104558
>>73104514
I dont know, I am sure you could find something.
>proving narcissism 
I mean I cant really prove anything I just have a strong intuition about it. Specifically your inability to admit you are wrong readily, your constant harassment of people for fun, and clear rampant egotistical beliefs (I am almost always right for example), both remind me heavily of several npd people I have interacted with at length in the past and are common traits of people that have it.
--- 73104630
I have Buddhist personality disorder and slept through class one Thursday as I am often a minute behind because I am left-handed
--- 73104655
>>73104558
irl he is an extremely sweet boy, he is super shy, super sweat, super eager to please, super loving, everything about him is amazing &lt;3
--- 73104685
>>73104655
Oh also he constantly goes into other threads and attempts to become the center of attention, struggling to let others be the focus of something is common in npd as well, if they are not the focus they commonly will pick fights with others (as your bf does). to shift the attention onto themselves.
--- 73104696
Many women prefer to give oral than receive it. Is it the same for transgirls? Do they enjoy having their penises sucked by their partners or does it increase dysphoria?
--- 73104708
>>73104507
no surprise they're narcissistic and charming. it makes their grooming easier.
--- 73104711
>>73104655
>irl
Okay, but that doesn't change anything. His egotistical thought patterns and refusal to accept any form of blame or responsibility, and his general belief that he's infallible and never wrong about anything, remain.
--- 73104734
>>73104685
I picked up on that in another thread where someone was trying to get a straight answer out of her/him for ages, eventually gave up and started talking to a different anon who actually understood the subject and Tk was like a child, immediately acting out once the attention was withdrawn. I thought it was weird because his character is normally very calm.
--- 73104739
>>73104655
Did you read what I said earlier? people with npd can be some of the sweetest and most loving people in the world.. for the first few months, maybe even the first year or so. When the other shoe drops you may change your tune. Also, the fact he constantly uses you as his flying monkey for arguments and shaming of others is another point that hints towards him at least having narcissistic tendencies. Oh and also he finds it extremely hard to apologize (ex: me, I had to cut myself to get him to admit I MIGHT be an incel). 
>>73104711
I am glad someone else sees it. Oh also he does not seem to have genuine empathy, his ways of acting regarding that are also reminiscent of people with npd I have interacted with.
--- 73104755
>>73104734
They are actually fairly infantile in ways, it is a bit surreal. I only know so much about it because I have bpd and those with npd form very toxic dynamics with bpd people, I actually correctly sniffed it out in the last person I got even decently close with and they admitted they had it but hadnt said anything. I may be wrong about him having it but he at least has traits.
--- 73104789
>>73104739
>>73104711
>>73104685
when I am with him, I don't see a mean bone in his body. He's super gentle and loving. I just don't see it.
--- 73104800
>>73104789
>but he is so nice :3
is not a counterargument, for reasons I have previously stated.
--- 73104836
>>73104734 
>Tk was like a child, immediately acting out once the attention was withdrawn
I've seen instances of this too in other threads he's been in. If no one replies to him he starts butting into other anons conversations with the obvious intent to bait people. Also his shitshow a few days ago when someone called him out on a spelling mistake was just bizarre.
--- 73104857
>>73104789
Look, he might or might not be full-blown NPD, but he has a lot of maturing to do either way. No fucking shit he's nice to his girlfriend during the earlymost honeymoon days, who the hell isn't? My sister's ex was a great guy for the first year or so before he started beating her. Obviously your boyfriend isn't and never will be physically violent, but the point stands that character flaws begin making themselves more obvious as time goes on. He probably has little frustration towards you because you water his ego so much and so he has little reason to feel contempt or be anything but kind to you; NPD or not, he clearly has some ego problems but you rarely if ever challenge him and kiss his ass 24/7, so there's been no issues. But if you do ever have a serious fight, the structure of the relationship might destabilize unless he learns some humility and learns how to listen to others instead of being a brick wall.
--- 73104860
>>73104836
I think it is telling of his lack of understanding of the disorder that his defense from this is that he doesnt mind being harassed. people with npd often will harass people just for easy attention, it does not have to be good attention, as long as they are the focus.
--- 73104898
>>73104696
difficult to xomment on this depends on too many things but i dont think retard san would like to receive blojobs even if her bf is bi because of other things theyve said
--- 73105005
>>73104789
I love you! &lt;3
>>73104558
I do admit I'm wrong sometimes, and of course I think I win most debates here. Most people hardly even try to debate back and most are really low IQ chuds. Also, my "harassment" seems to almost all just be calling people normalfags or just labels like that or attention whore.
>>73104857
So when's the time bomb about to blow? I promise we'll be sweet lovers forever! &lt;3
I've dealt with a lot of conflict, seriously, though. I don't think I'm going to crack if we have an argument one day then I go full manipulative narc mode.
--- 73105028
>>73105005
I have seen one instance of you admitting you are wrong. The people with npd I have spoken to also think they win almost if not all debates because others are low IQ or illogical. 
>calling people these names
Yes, for attention, which it does get you so you continue to do it.
>forever
yeah that is not indicative of lovebombing at all, lol.
--- 73105048
>>73105028
It's not lovebombing since it's true. If you want me to point out a time I've been wrong I can do so if you have examples. I don't think I'll agree I lose debates to people who think that robots are when you're just a quirky normalfag, dough.

Same but he only admitted after being cornered into it and was passive aggressive about it
--- 73105071
>>73105048
You argued with me about me being a normalfag for months. I had to harm and threaten to harm myself a lot of times for you to begrudgingly admit you were wrong, you even said I was as I was threatening you with minecrafting you and your gf.
--- 73105120

NPD trait number 40: trying to constantly belittle others. Your smug anime girls play into an overall effort to dominate others and make them feel stupid and small.
--- 73105135
>>73105120
I cant tell if this is sarcasm but I genuinely considered that as well. The specific choices of images are telling.
--- 73105232
>>73105135
Nope, not sarcasm at all. Why would it be? His modus operandi is to make everyone he argues with feel as though they're beneath him.
--- 73105282
>>73105232
I have noticed that too. It is almost as if the content of the argument is only barely related and the primary focus is making the other person submit or emotionally react. quite slimy.

You didn't have to make an entire thread about this, Retard-San.
--- 73105572
i love retard-san so much... but would i if she wasn't taken? i guess it's our fate to want what we cannot have...
--- 73105594
>>73105572
why would you love me? I don't think I'm that interesting lol
--- 73105596
Here's an actual picture of Retard-san, now fuck off and leave her alone
--- 73105624
>>73105572
Good taste.
>>73105594
Because you're sweet and lovey
>>73105596
Hair color is closer at least
--- 73105637

everything you post implies you are the perfect gf and you are always nice on these threads

>directly insults and attacks someone cutting themselves
lmao
--- 73105655

It wishes. Post a pic of a man wearing a brown wig and you get the idea.
--- 73105664
>>73105646
you're mentally ill and need help. if that's an insult to you then so be it but i'm not cutting myself over anything
--- 73105666
>>73105637
Yes, she has the typical tranny performative and exaggerated femininity, but she's generally not nice to anyone except her slave owner, I mean boyfriend.
--- 73105701
>>73105655
Her hair is natural lol.
>>73105666
She's always a perfect angel, dough.
--- 73105722
>>73105664
?
>>73105666
Yeah I find it funny they parade their relationship around like this when it is just one dominating the other but not in some meaningful way but one being a yes man
--- 73105725
Does anyone else want to hit Tranny-kun in the head with a baseball bat every time he says 'dough'
--- 73105736
>>73105725
He is doing it purposefully to get attention by making people angry, it is kind of funny if we all decided to pretend to be aggravated by certain behaviors he would probably start doing them regularly.
--- 73105769
>>73105725
Why?
>>73105736
I just think it's cute.
--- 73105783
>>73105769
Yes we are aware you think getting reactions out of people is cute.
--- 73105814
>>73105666
My bf is actually my slave, he said so after I owned him in an argument
--- 73105825
>>73105725
He's low IQ, he can't spell words correctly. But shhh, don't point it out, his ego can't handle it.
--- 73105900

oh not this shit again lmao goodbye thread

Age has nothing to do with wisdom. This is just old people cope for being physically useless burdens in society.

Retarded oldfag, wisdom is all about knowledge. A kid who knows about Fortnite is wiser than the old man who doesn't know about Fortnite. A kid who knows about programming is smarter than the old retard who doesn't even use a computer. If old people were so wise they wouldn't have to ask young people so much for computer help.

knowledge is not the same as wisdom

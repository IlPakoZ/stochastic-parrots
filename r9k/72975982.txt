He gave pretty clear prophecy and signs to look out for. 
>Mark of the beast that is implanted in your hand or forehead and is required to buy/sell goods.
>Beast system that people worship
>Apocalyptic world war that reaches its peak in Jerusalem
>anti-Christ declares himself to be God and emulates miracles

no they don't, not sure where people get this idea.
Doomsday preachers were nearly nonexistent until the 1900s. Christians weren't preaching that we're in the end times until the 20th century due to the world wars, and even that didn't really take off until Vietnam.
No clue where people get this idea that Christians have been saying it's the end times in every generation, there's no proof of that.

You should learn about history beyond what they teach you at school before making such affirmations. Here, have a little summary as an entry point on doomsday preaching https://www.britannica.com/topic/millennialism
>there's no proof of that
Every generation is definitely an overstatement, but there plenty of proof of people believing that the end times were coming.

>4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

>5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:

>6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:

>7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

>8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

>9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Also revelations mentions "the temple" (rev 11-1) the construction of the third temple will probably be within our lifetimes
>>72977512
since world war 2 people have been claiming such at least ("the jews coming to israel is a fulfilment of the promise!!1!") if we play our cards right we could last another thousand years before the end i reckon.

A) Revelation wasn't written or even said by Rabbi Yeshua

B) John of Patmos wrote it while secluded on a Greek island having "divine visions" in 93 AD

C) Revelation is CRAZY SHIT even by biblical standards. The only way you could take it seriously is if you believe John the elder is another prophet who speaks directly to Yahweh. In which case, why is he not revered on the same level as Christ or Moses? Or at least a saint?

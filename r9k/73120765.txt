> genetic failure dead end
i think, conceptually, the idea that you should feel bad about being a genetic dead end is actually so laughable and pathetic, once you really understand genes, gene editing, ai, and personal identity. people who are upset about this honestly are just ignorant and stupid

you are not your genes, you are your consciousness, memories, experiences, and personality, maybe your body. but your genes are just some string of information. you can express your genes in a small notepad document

and soon we will be able to change our genes, use ai technology to stop biological death, etc. its actually laughable to care about passing on your genes, honestly

>fuck ups
this one is much worse, because missing out on love and sex really do hurt. historically i coped with videogames and escapism. these days i cope with leaning about ai, and theological philosophy. i listen to philosophy everyday. thinking about stuff like morals, arguments for god and against god, thinking of the nature of god, etc. i think about god everyday for many hours, extensively. its my autistic interest

also, enjoying knowing there will either be an ai apocalypse, or an ai utopia also gives me purpose to stay alive. if its apocalypse, i lose nothing but my worthless live that i wanted to end anyways, and i get watch all the normies, chads, hypocrites, whores, roasties and power abusers die. sounds SPLENDID to me. if its a utopia, then by definition ill be in heaven, which also sounds splendid. thats why i think the future is splendid, and why i choose to struggle and continue living

I fetishize it.
I jack off to the idea of being genetic trash, a lesser man, etc.
I'm afraid if I ever even do get a gf I'll end up a literal cuck because half the time I blow my load I'm imagining someone else fucking the girl in front of me, while they bully me for being unable to do the same.
Pair that with a fucking crippling cbt and sph fetish and I feel completely hopeless.

existence comes before value, so any system of value which does not prioritize existence above other values will perish.

and what people value is highly genetic, so you if you want your values to persist, you must pass on your genes.

NTA posting to give my condolences. Not having your own people is brutal and why, despite being able to find love in another race, it is imperative that you do best for your children - by going with your own race and solidifying a base for them to have an anchor.

Lot of people are selfish though. They fuck around, destroy pair bonding, take outside of their own races, and the result is a broken child and broken home.

Sorry man. The worst part is nobody learns from examples like this. They'll say "love knows no boundaries" or some bs.

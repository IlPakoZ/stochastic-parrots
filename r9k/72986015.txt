I am the most unlucky person here.
To preface, I will state my two good qualities. Due to the intense mental suffering that has been my life, I have formed a very pleasant personality and genuinely only wish to help others and make the world a better place. I am also conventionally attractive.

But,
>3-5 years to live due to rapidly advancing weird ass unknown nervous system illness
>No family, no friends, no girlfriend, no support system
>Flunked out of community college because one class required a windows laptop (couldn't afford - had As in all my other classes, F in statistics.)
>Getting evicted because my landlord is a paranoid control freak
>Victim of every single form of abuse you can fathom, never reported any of it
>Debilitatingly mentally ill but unevaluated/unmedicated
>Got MKUltra'd

Gaze upon my suffering and share yours. Not trying to have a pissing contest.

>Wanted to be a dad ever since I was a small child
>Having a family has arguably been my life's goal
>Recently found out there's a very high chance I may be infertile due to a genetic disorder
It hurts, bros...

Jesus christ, anon. I cant compete with that. Im just sad i cant connect with people, no frens, so lonely. Looks microscopic compared to yours

Youre not larping, are you? This sounds unbelievably bad, anon. Unbelievably

>>72986032
I'm sorry brother. I also feel the pain of not being able to have kids, but only for financial reasons, no woman wants me. Really sorry.
>>72986034
I feel the same, but we can connect, I am also friendless and lonely. Thank you for your response, you are kind
>>72986047
I'm not larping sadly :(
It's becoming very bad. I don't think once you go homeless there's really any way back. I don't wanna be homeless. I tried so hard to work and be a hard worker, I've worked since I was sixteen years old and emancipated from my mother. I just wanted a decent life. I wanted love and a family and people who care about me but it's fucked. It's all fucked. And suffering from years of abuse I just can't trust people anymore and I'm just broken. And so fucking lonely.

I'm gonna give the suicide hotline a ring just to have someone to talk to rn. Thank you kind anons for being nice

Yeah people here overrate the fuck out of being good looking. When I was younger I'd have random women slapping my butt and even now I get women saying shit like "hey handsome." But I can't get a GF due to being a mentalcel.

9 times out of ten I'm the most conventionally attractive person in the room, but that doesn't matter when all my personality is a mask for years of neglect, beatings, ritual sexual abuse, drugging, psychological abuse and manipulation. And it just doesn't stop. Everywhere I go it keeps happening over and over again.
I'm tired. I just want to die now and get it over with, considering I'm going to die in a few years anyway. I want it all to end.

>had friends, life, etc
>crippling OCD strikes and leaves me incapacitated and I have to go into partial hospitalization 
>become a loser who plays video games all day and frequents 4chan
>completely forget how to interact with people 

I go back to school tomorrow because by insurance is retarded but I dont know how to act normally anymore
--- 72986192
Im really sorry you have to go through all that op. My heart goes out to you
--- 72986239
Your life is worse than mine. Me? Just your average 30yo loser, neet, completely friendless, poor and mentally ill. I was fine with those, until I started feeling sick recently. Eh.....

Rooting for you anyway, OP, although it looks like your neurological problem wont be fixed anytime soon. At least you'll find peace in death
--- 72986241
>>72986091
Im sorry that i thought you were larping. Im so sorry that this happened to you. I hope you find a solace here. I go here cause im lonely most of the time
--- 72986245
>>72986102
That sounds good. Ill try replying here as much as i can, OP. To keep you company and cause i also want some company

It's okay. Either I'll die or I'll survive.
>>72986239

>At least you'll find peace in death
I hope so anon.
>>72986241

>>72986245
Thank you anon, I appreciate it, I might go to sleep soon though.
>>72986254
Goodnight friend, thank you for being here
>>72986261
You too brother

Just got off the phone with the suicide hotline. Seems like they can't evict me immediately as they claimed. So they will have to take me to court eventually. So that's good, I have a little time at least.
--- 72986310
>>72986254
>>72986286
Good night, frens. I hope you have nice dreams
--- 72986314
>>72986307
To court? Why? Do you get evicted when youre suicidal?
--- 72986333
>have intense desire to get fucked by big black cock 
>develop psoriasis on my asshole 
No one will fuck me now, not even niggers
--- 72986347
>>72986314
No, you get evicted when your landlord doesn't like your attitude when you tell him you leave his property to pick up food deliveries. Like I said, control freak.
--- 72986366
>>72986347
Your landlord sounds like a dickhead
--- 72986374
>>72986366
He is a fucking dickhead. He also shut off my internet even though I paid for rent this month. Scum.
--- 72986397
>>72986347
Ohh okay
originalo
--- 72986442
>>72986347
Your not allowed to leave his property? What? Are you sure you're not in prison?
--- 72986459
>>72986374
Im going to bed in a little bit, I wish you the best. If you want to talk later just post here under the same name and we will all be there to support you

It's in the lease that I'm not allowed to get door dash to the house. That's fine, I complied by walking out to the street to collect door dash, which he calls "the end of the driveway" (even though it is no longer his property and not even close to the end of his driveway)
Definitely feels like a fuckin prison man.
>>72986459
Hey... Seriously thank you. You all made my night a little better.

Kidnap someone and feed them everyday. Then, disappear for a few days without feeding them. They will want you and miss you.

daydreaming about Iris and me in Jurassic Park, i'm driving a jeep and she is in the passenger seat, we are running away from 4 enraged T-Rexes. I drive through a cave and we end up in a beautiful canyon full of rainbows where she kisses me and we make out for literal hours.

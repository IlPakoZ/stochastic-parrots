Maybe 1/100 white people have the potential of looking like the romanticised elven/vamp/general fantasy euro aesthetic. Of those most will never maximise their potential.

The most beautiful people on earth tend to be white. But most whites arent beautiful.

Maybe 1 in 10,000. Attractive people are generally a very small elite minority in any place.

Yes, but they're all homosexual twinks.

Yes there are a lot of paintings of vampires in Europe, you will have to go to the right museums though.

no, you won't, they will all have short hair, be overweight or not be european, blondes are still uncommon too
--- 73007473
>white
>6ft plus
>long hair
>european
Good luck lmao, these chads are already locked down and those with high tier facial features are unlikely to have long hair (why hide good features??)
--- 73007478
>>73007086 (OP)
also this vampire looks way more asian than european with that thin nose and V shaped head
--- 73007493

Guys that look like that are Chad and have probably already settled down.

Im 30 and white and have a full head of shoulder length brown hair not balding in the least.

I'm a tall blonde man and I'm currently growing my hair out to achieve that phenotype. I'm American though.

vampires are actually a very cool mythical creature. it essentially fits the ideal of having an infinite amount of life experience at a given age. due to not aging and whatnot. hence why they are characterized as making better judgements of course of action and determining others' motivations. twilight is actually not really awful and would be more universally likable with self aware writing. there generally needs to be a revival of the gothic era. and vampires

>I want a handsome vampire bf.
so basically you want the same .01% of men that every other girl thirsts for?

you can do that. you can also use tinder extensively to line up guys before you go to europe. you can also try looking for foreigners in your country

but whatever. you can always find some chad of any race without much effort, as you are a roastie asian girl living on easy mode

European girl here. 95% of our handsome genes men got killed off during WW2 letting only the surviving incels breed. Most guys here are balding and fugly. There are a small minority of chads but they are all fuckboys and most of them arent into Asians. As for a beautiful looking anime guy with flowing blonde hair? I have never seen one in my entire life. Only 1 or 2 online and they were heavily shooped so. Yeah, might as well forget it.
--- 73009005
>>73008971
That guy is blonde Stacy only. He wouldnt touch an asian girl. 
Guys who date Asians are heavily stigmatized in Europe and Australia. Everyone thinks they are creepy losers.

Look, im sorry for being a jerk. i still dont agree with this JBK trend, Korea is for Koreans, Korean men date Korean Women only... but im a boomer. who am i to tell others who they can or cant date.

i wont egg those threads on anymore.
--- 73010307
>>73010207
people just like korean culture and will naturally want to defend it. its silly to inflate things. real attraction is deeper than culture, or i feel it is

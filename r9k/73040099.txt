Why do normies constantly preach "Darwinism", "capitalism", "survival of the fittest", "might is right", "the weak should fear the strong", "if you're a victim you deserve it", and even "karma" to justify their bullying. But when their bully victim fights back it's suddenly not Darwinism anymore? Suddenly society is expected to be compassionate and Christian. But when someone perceived to be an "incel" is the victim it's Darwinism. When you get cancer it's "natural selection". When they or their family gets cancer it's a "tragedy". Weird how that works.

According to normies the guy on the people on the left are the victims and the guy on the right is a bully.

They think they are worth more than you and most of the time the asswipes will stand their ground on proving that too when you stand up for yourself lol. Usually, its always a materialistic or intellectual excuse to why that is. Usually its just because they talk louder and have more people behind their back than you do.

what are you talking about, darwinism is one of the most taboo subjects, normies live in la la land where anything is possible and genes are irrelevent, especially considering brains and racial differences

>anything is possible and genes are irrelevent

Except when you look like this. Then normies quietly slip comments like "God I hope that guy doesn't reproduce".

but they'll give him advice like

and say his failures are because of bad personality, lack of trying etc.

Believe or not, society consists of more than one person and they don't meet before bullying you to get their stories straight. I still recommend suicide. Best of luck.

One minute normies and liberals are like "eugenics doesn't work thank goodness Hitler lost" when discussing the Nazis. Then two minutes later "God I hope that guy doesn't reproduce, imagine someone like him passing on his genes". Hmm. What's really going on? Intelligence and behavior are only hereditary when Reddit says they are.

See >>73040280. There are actually quite a lot of different people, and all of them have different opinions. I know you're just venting and whining but you should be hanging yourself instead.

You understand OP....
When a kid that gets bullied. Instead of learning how to play the game he flips the table over. That's what bullied school shooter does. These "normies" were only trying to teach the tard to play by the rules. So of course they have the right to preach about compassion, because the bullies were not at fault. The bullied kid was. Always.

Deal with it.tm

Normie logic

>Race isn't real
>IQ isn't hereditary
>Beauty is subjective
>Eugenics doesn't work
>Suicide is immoral.
>Hell is fake.
>But at the same time any white man who they perceive to be an "incel" or "racist" is genetically inferior and doesn't belong in the gene pool and they should all just go and kill themselves or something and burn in Hell. "God I hope that guy doesn't reproduce".

Most teachers and other staff in the school system had an inconsistent standard. They didn't want you to stand up for yourself.

A bully could for instance kick you in the shin, stab you with a pencil, and push you to the ground. This would get ignored unless you fought back. If you fought back they would give a sanctimonious speech like
>"Fighting is never the answer, you have to learn to resolve differences" "What would Christ do" "I don't care who started it"
>have to write an essay on it
>afterschool detention for a week

I learned from a young age that Chad is allowed to say he's gonna "kick my ass". Oh that's just him being confident and expressing himself. But if I talk back and say "no you're not" that's me starting stuff, being violent, making threats, and provoking him. I've never ever had the same human rights and civil rights that normal popular mainstream people have despite the Declaration of Independence saying all men are created equal. All because of the genes I was born with. Not my "actions".

To samefag, it makes sense when you consider the school system is based on the Prussian model. The Prussian model stresses obedience to authority. They don't want students that upset the apple cart by standing up for themselves.

One kid getting bullied has far less paperwork than kids fighting. It is easier for the school if you don't fight back, that is why they tell bullied kids violence isn't the answer.
At the end of the day being a teacher is just a job. They aren't there to help you

Okay, and? Anyone with half a brain has realized that the school system is a poorly-run prison for children.

That was the great part about my hippie elementary school. Any time two kids got into a fight they both were forced to sit down in a room and talk about it until both kids agreed the problem was solved. Sometimes these meetings went on for days but we always found a way to solve conflicts without violence. It's a shame public schools don't even remotely care enough to try that.

It's called Tautological morality. You're bad, so everything you do is bad. Normalfags are good, so everything they do is good.

The solution is not giving a damn what normalfags think and enjoying their suffering and whining.
--- 73040512
I don't get why everyone ITT thinks that normalfags really believe in principles/rules. They, like most people, do whatever benefits them, and will suspend their """beliefs""" whenever it suits them. Focus on what you can do and don't worry about said """rules."""

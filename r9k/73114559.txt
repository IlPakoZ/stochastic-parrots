You're trolling. Women almost never go to the gym, and if they do, it's always just to do 2 ass exercises, hog 2 benches, a squat rack, 3 barbells, take photos of their ass in shapewear in the mirror and then post it to their instagram. Women don't do anything that isn't instantly instagrammable. Gyms are, as the other guy said, 90% men.

Men still do ALL the work. Women objevlctively contribute, not only nothing, but less than nothing. They are a net negative on the tax coffers. And that's with us having gone into semi retirement, since the sole purpose of the enormous amount of work we used to do was providing for a wife and family, and there are now no decent options for either. Even if you can find a woman who is a virgin and not fat, they've trashed the marriage system and made a nightmare society for raising offspring in. You don't get anything for free. If foids want men to return to slaving for them, they need to put in a modicum of effort.

It's not a debate. The entire tax base is supported by men, with zero contribution from women (women deduct more in welfare than they put in). All essential jobs are overwhelmingly male, still. Men are the only productive gender. The fact that this remains true, with a quarter of them checked out, shows you how worthless women are.

Nope 0.1% are assholes cause they have options and women throw themselves at them. Incels start off as nice guys cause they can't be assholes and get a girl.

Loneliness is a meme because anyone can go vibe at any time. The problem with porn is that people start to watch it for more than 15 minutes a day, and then they don't even go outside or feel motivated to vibe with women. Some of these retards think "rejection" is hard to deal with like they are still trapped in a 5 year olds body (caused by porn).

Women changes hobbies and beliefs and philosophical stances so easily... They can't focus and dedicate themselves to some subject, unless it's a group of other people and it has to do with being social... Men don't need others to motivate them to start doing things for long long term... So, yeah... Women hobbies are shit... It's just their way to socialise and have further recognition... That's all...

As i stated earlier, i am a khhv, yet i have never watched porn - i find it awfully pathatic to pleasure oneself to shit like that. I have also been rejected by every woman i was attracted to and asked out. Granted, that's only 4 women, but you can't seriously be implying that i am supposed to go around accosting random women on the street? It takes time to build attraction, no sane person is attracted to dozens, hundreds of people. And therein lies the issue.

Again, asking someone out is asking them to commit to a serious relationship. You are at fault here as much as anyone else - look at how you treat the concept of a relationship, with sexual implications as well! You view it so casually, when it is supposed to be a lifelong commitment. Porn is not the issue - the underlying core problem is that promiscuity is so normalised nowadays, whereas before, when there wasn't a pandemic of loneliness, chastity was a virtue. How are people supposed to value relationships, when intercourse, the most intimate apex of a relationship, is handed out like candy?

Porn is the issue. If you see it as a lifelong commitment then you would never watch porn.

men who don't fear rejection typically have sex or date a large multitude of women, only rejecting excessively ugly or fat women, and even they can get some drunk nigger to fuck them

I have never watched porn. I jack off maybe once every 2 weeks, and that's purely to my imagination. The problem is that society (mostly "liberated" modern women) views relationships as something evanescent, you can go from one to another like you're changing socks. It's the biggest problem today.

1. You are part of society and clearly projecting your insecurity and vapid disinterest in serious relationships. Whether your trust issues are valid or not its 1000% your fault for not fixing them.
2. Being in any relationship, even a shitty transactional one, is still better than being alone and watching porn all day. Some will disagree and cope, but humans function off of feedback and social support. Theres no substitute for strength in numbers

again the exception that proves the rule
lets say I lost both of my arms and could never go rock climbing again, and then for the next couple weeks I spent most of my time inside

Friends are key for social exposure. It's like dog walking, going outside with a dog makes walking around aimlessly less weird.

She wants you to feel bad for her so she can get your attention and possibly take your resources. She LOVES sociopathic chads, they dont make her feel awful like shes claiming. She wants you to think that her faborite activity is hurting her against her will so you gove her things.

I settled for a sensitive guy. It's impressive how awkward and unmasculine he is. I have to constantly build him up or he gets hurt feelings. He has to be told directly what to do and is very obedient but again dumb as rocks. I tell him jokingly that I want to beat him up all the time but I actually mean it.

Sad, many such cases. Love how you used the word 'settled' lmao. The only saving grace for unmasculine/sensitive guys is that women love a sense of power, especially from their sex appeal. I would like a relationship like that, but I have way too much self respect to tolerate being treated like a dog, and that's the only way you can give her such a strong sense of power that it makes up for not being masculine

ok but think of this. If a woman liked porn you wouldn't care (you'd probably like it). If a woman was sensitive that would be normal. If a woman had a high opinion of herself and worked out all the time you'd like that. if she was distant and emoitioanlly manipulative you'd think that was normal. if she was woke but a hypocrite that would be normal.

There is literally nothing wrong with the second one. Women are so fucking immature these days, because she has spent years of her life just fucking around she has no interest in actually emotionally connecting with a man and thinks a man having any emotion other than wanting to fuck her is evil. I mean notice how she didn't list "guys who only want to have sex with you/want a living fucktoy?" That was one of the most common complaints about guys back when women matured past 14, now it isn't even mentioned because that is what modern women actually want out of a relationship.

No, there wasn't. Just another lie told by progressives who want to sully the past and pretend as if the present day isn't significantly worse than just 30 years ago. Kings would never fuck a peasant girl that was improper. We had hundreds of years of royalty sticking to themselves retard. The societies in the middle east where there were harems all fell apart and I would argue polygamy is the reason. In reality, in the past both men and women had to work hard and labor to survive. People married each other to have kids and depend upon one another to stay afloat. There were no loser men and there weren't whores anywhere near the scale that we have today either. People were just happy and married. Now you have retarded girlboss shit and infantislised women who haven't aged mentally since they were 14-16 and still expect other people to do everything for them. That's why women become so miserable late 30s into their 40s if they don't have kids. The mature women get married and have kids, the immature ones keep riding their looks to receive free shit until their looks run out then they come into their middle age with no skills, no personality, no assets, nothing of real value in their life.

Autistic PUAs have two autistic phrases: cold approach and warm approach. 

Some warm approaches are closer to what people normally do. Like how you meet people at bars and through group activities.

Would you kill someone if you could get away with it just because? I certainly would

No. I also save animals like lizards that get stuck inside or snails on the sidewalk that could get stepped on, and I dont tell anyone about it.

Around half of people would, maybe a bit more. The other half are moralfags.

Killing someone sounds exhausting and messy. I wouldn't want to get their blood on me, it sounds disgusting. Hiding a body also sounds like a lot of work. 

I'm undecided on the selecting and stalking of a victim. On one hand it is fun and sometimes I do follow strangers around town just for fun. On the other hand, it sounds like a full time job tracking a specific person and waiting for them to be alone and vulnerable. 

I guess killing a total random avoids that but I'd rather kill someone I've followed around a little. I'd want to get to know them from a distance first. Also knowing that there were times they were alone and I could have killed them would help draw out the enjoyment before eventually killing them.

Killing someone "just because" would not benefit me in any way. I might eat a person if I could get away with it.

FUCK YES. would try to make it not so gorey though. if it ends up gorey then i dont care, they deserve it

First let's point out there's a difference between kill and murder. Never murder.

In self defense? I'm not the least bit concerned with getting away with it. If I'm called to war? I don't really want to but it might be inevitable.

I have so many ideas of torturing someone, ending their life in the most despicable and vile way.

 I wouldn't mind staining my hands and forearms, legs and feet, face and mouth to the marrow of his warm blood. 

I would rip out his tongue, teeth, ears, tendons from his heels before killing him.

No, but I would consider giving head and shoulder pats to people like some kind of comforting ghost so they feel better but are also vaguely perturbed. Maybe start some urbex legends. Or leaving random socks/whatever they have never seen before in random places around peoples' houses until they install cameras that mysteriously malfunction before even more appear. No reason why, I just think it'd be funny. Balance it out with something just generally beneficial, maybe.

I dunno why that got deleted. It's important as to why I could get away with it.

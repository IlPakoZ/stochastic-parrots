You will never be cute.

Because you're a femme little faggot that has decided to become a dick receptacle. You shouldn't get choices; you should get pinned in a parking lot and fucked until you're crying and need butthole surgery. 

Femboy faggots are literally built for ugly loser cock.

>i have adopted all of the worst traits of women thus rendering me completely fucking pointless

Just share him in the parking lot with your fellow robots, we can go get a new one after. These sluts expire at around 25 anyway.

Crazy how fast femboys became popular and started to have high standards like femalegirls.

It's weird, huh? 

It was better when gay boys just happened to enjoy playing at being feminine and crossdressing for you sometimes, instead of creating an identity around it. I miss my younger twink boylove and I met him literally elevem years ago on /a/ and he was too good for me, and now I get pissed at the boys I want to fuck because no one will ever even come close to how amazing he was. He started liking girls more and we severed ties. I think he's the only person I ever truly loved. I hate being a faggot but I still often think about him and miss him, and it's been 7 years since we last talked. I wish I hadn't been so afraid to be ousted as bisexual back then, I might've been able to have a real relationship with him if I was bolder. Fuck my gay life.

glad you at least admit it, femboys and trans sometimes have HIGHER standards than cis women because they are smaller portions of the population and more in demand in some ways

It was a painful experience, but I knew it would end because I was a coward that couldn't court him properly. I wish I'd made him my prince and not been such a fucking weak-minded shithead. I was a sobbing, drunken mess when he told me he'd been doing some certain things with a certain girl he'd dropped hints about.

God I miss him.

you will never be a woman. calling us "biofems" doesn't change the fact that you're an ersatz hole for prison gay incels to cum in when they can't find literally any woman who wants them.

It's not really some constant thing, this thread just reminded me of it, and when I reflect on it I miss him. I don't hate him, he's a genuinely good person. I always felt so fucking inferior to him, though. Sometimes we'd spend like 9 hours just chatting on Skype and then whispering sweetly to each other in the later hours over mic and eventually masturbating together.

Thank you, anons, that's very sweet. Sometimes when I get like this I think about him and just really fucking miss him. I really wonder if he ever thinks about me anymore.

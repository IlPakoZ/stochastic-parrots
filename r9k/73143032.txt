>all the qt nurses tell me how sweet I am, I make a very big effort not to hit on them or stare at them or anything
heres where it gets mean,
>one day this 19 year old CNA realizes "haha anon are you scared to make eye contact with me?"
>starts just following me around a few times each shift and staring at me, and laughing when I glance at her and look away immediately "whats wrong anon?", literally just follows me around staring at me and laughing

> another one runs up and hugs me at the end of the shift, awkwardly hug her back, being sure not to touch her more than is appropriate "haha anon hugging you is like hugging a wall, I feel like I just hugged a wooden board"
>one chick keeps handing me her banana and asking me to peel it for her at lunch..idk what inside joke is here but they always laugh at me
>walking to the supply room through a doorway or something, they randomly stand in front of me stick their arms out to their sides and turn their back to me (picture like how they block in basketball) "whats the matter anon, cant get through?"

What the FUCK is this shit?
I feel like they are literally trying to bait me into befriending them so they can bully me and make fun of me more.
tl;dr:
Im almost 30, ex-infantry, pretty fucking shredded(no homo), and thought I had outgrown by beta upbringing via hard work but turns out im still just a bitch getting bullied by a fucking 5 foot tall teenage girl just like in high school

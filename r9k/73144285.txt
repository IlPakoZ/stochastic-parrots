enjoyable things only exist because they were made by people who only exist because women had sex with people. if you enjoy things and you are not having sex with women you are a cuckold.

>'ache' having a hard K sound
>'shown' not sounding like 'town', down', 'crown', etc
>some words having a consonant added with the suffix -ed; 'controlled', planned'
>other words no; 'failed', 'boarded'
>weirdly spelt words like 'night', 'wednesday'
There's so many oddities like these that can only be mastered through just remembering what's correct and what isn't.

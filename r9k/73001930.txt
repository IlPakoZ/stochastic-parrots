who in their right fucking mind would want a "practice gf", when I ask a girl out it's because I enjoy spending time with her and could imagine doing it until the day I die

This is bait but I'm going to respond as if it isn't;
I actually cannot believe we still have these threads, the only people getting "gfs" off this board are normalfags larping as robots, ACTUAL ROBOTS DON'T GET GFs, e-dating or otherwise. You are seething over the actions of normies and projecting it onto robots. If you're this fucking stupid you deserve to get treated like shit.

I don't believe in "practice" relationships. A person should be with a person they connect with physically, emotionally, and mentally. If you can "practice" relationship elements that are easily interchangeable then you're just leaning how to disassociate people from their individual qualities. A relationship shouldn't need general practice and experience to be successful, it in theory means they don't love one another enough.

I'm extremely emotional available. I find the idea of being supportive of a woman's problems and providing her with an outlet for stress relief so she can deal with those problems on her own (while still knowing she can ask me for help if she's not simply trying to find an easy way to do something) very romantic and appealing. 

I'm not desperate and my standards are that a woman should be equally intelligent, emotionally intelligent and empathetic, and physically durable as i am

>have low standards and are desperate
Listen here, just because I have low standards and am desperate, doesn't mean I would treat my gf poorly. If anything, it's the opposite. I treated my short, fat, insane gf very well. I always told her how beautiful she was to me(I wasn't even lying because I loved her), took her on cute dates, always listened to her when she told me about her day, would always comfort her when she was upset. I did my very best to be a good bf.

if u had even decent reading comprehension, the only part of my post mentioning getting a girlfriend is: 
>use girls as "practice gfs"
most of you would jump at any chance to use a girl for company and attention and then discard her as soon as someone more attractive comes along

So you still said it then and my post is still applicable to the thread? What an utterly retarded thing to say. Again, you are using the experiences you have from talking with normalfags and projecting it onto robots because you need to convince yourself that robots are the source of all evil

i was hurt by my first love, i don't trust girls anymore, i just fuck them. but i stopped lying about my intentions and it still works, actually finding an emotionally unavailable girl and having sex with her and talking about how fucked up you are emotionally is quite fun, experienced it quite a few times 

in the best case scenario i somehow get into a conversation with a girl who is perfect in every way and lives near me, but that's not happening as I am schizoid, antisocial and just date girls from dating apps who are all whores and stupid unironically, also I'm getting too old I'm 25

What is an "actual robot", this retarded term changes definition from thread to thread.
--- 73003413
>>73003380
quiet, isolated, not considered attractive, autistic, sperg interests, incel. i just want someone like me, not some annoying eboy
--- 73003461
>>73003413
That's me but I'm not ugly, and I'm a virgin but not really "incel", just haven't met the right person, either I'm not interested in a girl who's interested or it's the other way around. What are your special interests?
--- 73003481
>>73003380
The original definition was someone who lived a life contrarian to the norm and was happy in doing it and felt no shame. NEET/hiki, celibate, manchild, engrossed in his hobbies but still happy/wanted no part in the normalfag rat race. Incel was kind of a different subculture but the two overlapped eventually, being incel was more about being ugly/short and craving to be a normal person with a gf and job but being unable to do so because of losing the genetic lottery
>>73003413
That's what all they say lmao. If that's what you wanted, you would've been married by now. Unattractive spergs who'd worship the ground you walk on are dime a dozen and you know it too

yeah sure. the amount of normie men ive come across is way higher than any men i actually do like. or i dont fit their standards. i dont have low standards, but they are genuinely unconventional
>>73003495
you know nothing about me, you only claim to be willing to date me because im female

The amount of mental effort you have to expend putting out the insecurity fits with /r9k/ girls is one of the biggest drawbacks.

Correct. Luckily, there's a way for people to start knowing each other and see if they're compatible for a relationship. It's called dating. You should try it sometime. With me
--- 73003595

i dont want to go on a tangent here because that makes me feel embarrassed.

That's fine, but don't go around on the internet talking about how nobody wants to date you because it's a lie. You can't have your cake and eat it too

>you dont know a single thing about me
I could learn BY TALKING TO YOU. THAT'S THE POINT. You could be bad but you could be good. I don't know. I'm still willing to try, cause literally nothing is certain. I could step outside of my house one day and get struck by lightning. Does that mean that i should never leave my house again? You're not being realistic. You're being a paranoid coward

you don't exist cause truly obsessive girls would just be grateful to be in their presence and would be happy with anything they do.
i'd let you spend all your energy on me anytime, but i'm just not obsessive myself. i just like being together with someone all the time.
--- 73004314
>>73004303
obsessiveness only works if it is reciprocated, otherwise you're exactly like the men i mentioned in op
--- 73004534
>>73004314
no it's not. i had an obsessive girl and she was really friendly and sweet and all she wanted to do was call me and do things with me and told me how amazing i was and became super happy when i talked to her

if you can't do that, don't call yourself obsessive, you're just annoying and needy

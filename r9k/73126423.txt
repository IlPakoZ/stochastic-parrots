I am in a similar situation to most of you guys I will most likely never find love because I'm autistic and socially debilitated. However I have a well paying job in western Europe making about 60 kafter taxes putting me in the top 5% of my country, with the potential to make way more. I'm /fit/ 1/2/3/4 and well educated. What steps would you guys take to not make my life a living hell? 
My standards are essentially don't be fat or bpd. I can handle the high body counts and have accepted that I will have to take comfort with that. 

So far I thought of:
1) Mail order a bride from Asia or Africa or go get one myself. 
2) Adopt a NEET and house them in exchange for affection. 
3) Paying escorts for gf experiences. 

All these options suck please give me something to strive for because I can't take it anymore.

lol. this is what your future gf/wife did with chad, with tyrone, when you were a lonely incel loser struggling to keep up at school. men who fucked better, had bigger dicks, were more aggressive, who she fell in love with before she was burnt out on dick and drugs

she will never really love you either, because her part youthful experiences was with men who are better with you, but she cant do any better, so she settles, and lies to you, and pretends she likes you, because she cant do any better. she is litterally pretending to appease your fragile ego for the entire relationship, because she is that pathetic, and so are you for dating a used up whore

Have you tried talking to grills

If you're able move to south america, if you're in my city I GUARANTEE I could set you up with a cute 18-20yo latina eager to date a well off european guy.

That's all right I have made peace with that fact. If only it's make believe I just want to be normal. 

>>73126509
This might surprise you but I have, I just can't ever get it to work. This is not me being picky and going only for women out of my league this is just my experience. I have had female friends but noone wants anything beyond that if I ask and trust me I tried. 

>>73126511
Wouldn't she just leave me the moment she gets a visa in europe and force me to marry her so she can also take half my stuff when it inevitably happens?

>>73126556
>I just can't ever get it to work
Why not?
--- 73126702
>>73126556
um, she could I guess? But that's why you shouldn't go for the obvious girl that is after that, so you don't date a girl that has nothing else going on for herself. Latina girls are raised conservatively and taught by their mothers/grandmothers to be good obedient wives.
>inb4 latinas are whores. 
I'm talking about ACTUAL born and bred latinas, not the fucked up american offshoots who aren't even latinas, just shallow americans with latino ancestry. Culture makes a HUGE difference.

I tried asking her to go to the aquarium after more of these convos and said no, you tell me.

Oooh that is interesting I will look into planning my next vacation there. 
It seems very promising to wife a latina. I would definitely do it if it has a decent probability of not leaving me. 
Where do you meet these girls in south America?

i dont think you appreciate the magnitude of the problem here

all of the love songs she will listen to will remind her of men she's actually attracted to
all of her memories of the best sex she had was with other men
statistically, unless you are a sex god, you wont be her best. and she wont find you attractive. she will endure sex like a nasty chore, because thats what it is for her. she will try makes excuses to avoid it. it will feel like rape for her, but without the sexual pleasure normally associated with it
she literally spend years being a smug proud whore, rejecting and making fun of losers like you, only to settle down with you because she needs you for money for companionship, and you are the best she can get
she will lie to you about everything. lie to you about how shitty her ex's were, lie to you about how great sex is with you, lie to you about her past. because if she told you the truth to your face, your knees would buckle, and she knows how fragile you are
she literally have her best years to men who otherwise bullied you or made fun of you, and she resentfully settles with you because those are her options

do you think you can look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself that you can fall in love with a girl like that?
--- 73126839
>>73126765
Did you ask her in person?

Well, I drink straight from the source. I'm latino myself. You have a wide variety of women to choose, you wanna fuck around with fun women? Hit the nightclubs and bars, you want more serious women but not thaaaat serious? Try out some dating apps. Want a serious trad latina wife? Well now that takes some time, church, private universities or other hobbies like dancing, cooking, theatre will land you some more "laid back" women.

But most latinas are very jealous and will fiercely be possessive of you, and are also very fiery, so you gotta have balls because otherwise they'll run all over you, and you'll thank them for it.

Due to your status as an european you got a leg up over the rest of the population, almost all girls will at the very least give you a chance to get to know them. If you're serious about it we can talk in private and see if you wanna come down to my country of origin and I can hook you up in my city.

making money doesn't matter anymore if you're not some 200k+ a year CEO, an executive, or a drug dealer. women don't care if you're not Chad, which if you're on here asking how to get a gf, you most certainly aren't.

>>73126839
I did, I can't remember my exact words it all seems like a blur now but is how it went:
" Hey, instead of eating all the fishes we can also look at them together, do you wanna go to the aquarium with me? " 

She is asian and jokes about eating dogs and all the endangered animals so it made sense to me to go along with that.

Unironically you're already taking the exact steps to find a neet gf so I think you're on the right track.

>>73126836
If she endures her life with me I will endure it with her. I can't even imagine what a relationship with someone is like so it will have to do, if it is not what I imagined it to be then things will have to end. I don't know how I will feel at the moment but this is my understanding of the situation now.

how do you feel about trans people

>>73126964
Not bad, if she was agreeing to get lunch with you over and over again you clearly don't have radioactive autism. Try keeping her as a friend while pursuing other girls, being friends with girls makes you more attractive to other girls
--- 73127075
>>73126893
haha it sounds like you're living the good life amigo.
I am into exploring national museums and theatre shows so that might be a good starting point. 
It will be a nice change of pace to have someone be possessive of me other than my boss. As my previous reply stated, I can't imagine what it would be like to receive that kind of affection. 

>>73127022
They must be very convincing to make it work. I know through in vivo experimentation that men are not my cup of tea.

--- 73127134
>>73127064
Alright at least good to hear that I'm not autistic beyond repair.

So far I have. 
1) Pursuing cultural activities in South America and finding a trad latina gf. 
2) Wait it out. While I understand your sentiment I also have the pressure to not off myself while I'm at it and prefer it to be sooner rather than later because things are not really working out for me with the current way of doing things.

i look like a tall muscular femboy but it was worth a try. good luck! moving to europe just sounds pretty fun

honestly if you do come to south america, party hard for a while and then focus on finding your trad latina gf. Believe me, every man on god's green earth needs to party like latinos do. You won't regret it even if you're the most introverted autist that exists.

a) Practice makes perfect
b) Numbers game
Having proven that you can get a girl interested enough in you to at least hang out and be friendly with / comfortable around you, if you just keep trying it's basically inevitable that you'll find *someone*. Maybe try finding girls who are interested in the stuff you're in

You make me happy, thanks for your words arguably the most useful anon in my Friday night thread. 

>>73127436
It's just been hard to cope with all the rejections I'm 26 so I want to change my strategy and take advantage of my youth while I still can. 

>>73127149
Thread wasn't complete with your generic incel replies, thank you for participating. I don't align myself with your views, they are fundamentally broken. I won't go into too much detail but it comes down to believing all women all whores/sluts and complaining or believing their and your own lies and being happy in your ignorance. (this is assuming all women are sluts etc..) 
The only thing I can gather is that a relationship with me should be codependent if she is into me for my money or status as an eu citizen. If you are a bot I would like to thank your maker. 

Thanks guys :) have a nice weekend the aim of this thread has been achieved.

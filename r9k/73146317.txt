A death by heart disease at 40 is not what you get by being a man or a woman lol. Even really obese people don't necessarily get heart disease even close to that early.

Thanks.

You're my cute lovey forever! &lt;3

Please, report in while I prepare. Make (You)rself known while I get my notes together.

I've made progress in the right direction at least. Every year I get better and better at flirting with girls, and further in further in relationships before making a 'new mistake'. Chads naturally learn all the dos and don't of relationships since they get so many reps in by virtue of their looks. Even if they don't admit it, they passively learn, which is why so many Chads have good social skills, since they naturally have way more opportunities to work on them. If you aren't good looking, and especially if you're a shut in, you have to construct your own experiences to learn. I've been making a lot of progress to this end. I'm no Chad, but I mog my younger self by a fucking mile

>2023, no friends but cnc machinist making ok money, no real hobbies or interests, absolute rock bottom motivation and energy

there's more to the story than that but let's just say that 2020-2021 was extremely fucking bad for me even outside of covid. it took me until late 2022 to get my career back on track, and now in 2023 i am going to do what i can to maybe scrape some semblance of a life together. i don't know if i can, i don't think i will, but i will make an attempt at bare minimum. i am angry, bitter, deeply unhappy and resentful of almost everything but for some fucking reason i have not yet given up the idea that somehow there is a possibility that i may not be outright condemned to complete failure. partial failure is still on the table, naturally

>Age 8: I was racist for reasons I didn't quite understand, and had no understanding of politics nor did I have any real ideology.
>Age 16: Stopped being racist and decided to judge on an individual level instead - what one person does should not be held against their tribe as a whole.
>Age 24: Became racist again after dozens of negative real-world experiences. Started browsing /pol/, looked at the bigger picture and began nooticing things, judging tribes by their accomplishments, quality of life, cleanliness, how prone to violence they are, how many LiveLeak gore videos they produce, etc.

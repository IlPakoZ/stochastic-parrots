--- 73124926

yep.
typically if you have a waist that thin, your bf% needs to be quite low, which means skinnier arms and thighs, as well as smaller tits.

I hooked up with a girl like that and her ass tasted bad and her pussy was hairy so i couldnt even eat her out

Note the somehow pristine body despite apparently being a neet slob. That doesnt happen irl these women are disgusting

Where are you from in the West that this can still be considered the standard?

Don't be fat and you'll get a guy.

It is literally a cartoon version of the exact same girl in body type/basic appearance, but with glasses, knee highs and a t shirt. Literally proving the point
--- 73129518
This is me but with longer pubes and hair. My hair is down to my waist but always super messy. I dont ever really shave my armpits or pubes because no one is seeing them and I hate the feeling. But this post is a larp anyway, moids only want Stacy
--- 73129522
>>73124918
idealized bodies exist, but most people don't really have that as a STANDARD. Might as well point out how women aren't cel shaded
--- 73130220
>>73129518
I have wavy/slightly curly hair so I'm not sure if it's the same for everyone, but the constant itchiness for the first week or so after shaving is one of the most annoying feelings. Same for the neckbeard but that's easier to manage since I have to shave every day anyway.

would you workout and do gym activities together with a fembot gf?
--- 73130261
>>73129518
I don't want Stacy, because Stacy only ever insulted me for being "different" and never had a coherent thought in her brain. I want my cute fembot GF that looks like OP's pic and I won't be gaslighted into thinking otherwise
--- 73130274
>>73130242

I just did my daily exercise routine and talked out loud to myself as though this were really happening. Good God, I am so lonely.

Basically this but also Japanese.
--- 73130310
>>73124050 (OP)
Based op, this is my secret desire as well. Who wants a stuck up, prudish gf when you can have a degen gf who realizes how retarded life is and just wants to enjoy it while we're alive. This is unironically my biggest motivation to get a job and move out, so I can support a gf like this while I work remotely and we can just degen out together and enjoy life while we watch the world pass us by
--- 73130323
>>73129518
Would you at least trim so it's easier for me to go down on you/lick your armpits?

That's all I want as a fit guy. Maybe not gym, but still working out. Gym work is too repetitive.

That the anon you were responding to holds you in contempt because you don't belong here and it's tantamount of a person with a limp telling a person in a wheelchair
>Ah well, too bad I've always been able to walk 

Also there's the irony of Vegeta basically being out for "cyborg" heads during that arc in DBZ
I recommend you an hero or never post about gay shit like that again on this board

It's just been too long. I was thinking about Cell but forgot that immediately before it they were trying to hunt cyborgs. I used to play dragon ball games on my psp, nds, and wii quite a lot as a kid, but as I said, it's been a long time lol. I really enjoyed playing as Broly.
>>73130655
>That the anon you were responding to holds you in contempt because you don't belong here and it's tantamount of a person with a limp telling a person in a wheelchair
Well, I don't really care because as a cyborg I don't belong anywhere.

I've been noticing over the past few days there have been an influx of threads talking about decaying board culture and reminiscing on old /r9k/.
Glad people are realizing what's been happening to this place and how zoomers and troons are ruining everything.

While I miss old /r9k/, I don't think current /r9k/ is as bad as it was like two or three years ago

Its not people realizing and you're part of the "return to old board culture" simp raid that's ongoing.

The old culture was full incel women hatred and its still the predominant culture, that's what terrifies you. You want to introduce full on cuck simpery.

Zoomers are the ones who hate trannies.
Actual millennials who were here from the 2000s jerked off to trannies and didn't treat them like a political issue.
And also faggots like you have been complaining about /r9k/ not being good anymore for almost a decade now. It's not anything new. Stop whining and make the threads you want to see.
>b-but my threads aren't successful
Then you have shit taste and should leave.

The old board culture was more comfy with greentexts from the user's day to day lives than the garbage pile of "do white peepo/wimmin/murricans really? /gay/cut/30+/NEETgen / trannysistas/fembots/robots would you [x] if [y] [z]? / join my discord / incel! incel! gua gua gua!"

I do not enjoy the e-girl simp discord drama threads that have taken over
Incel and woman-hating board culture is what I am trying to return too.
Look around /r9k/ as of current, cuck sissy discord drama egirl simping threads is ALL THERE IS

Exactly what this anon said

Exactly, you get it.
This is supposed to be the no gf / misosgyny / incel board.
That's where /r9k/ hit its stride and that's how it functions best to this day.
It was incredibly gay back when anons called each other "gentlemen" and posted cringe greentext stories, got better with the advent of wojak no gf feelposting, and then hit the sweet spot once no gf feels curdled into outright hating on women.

I was here before you, newfag. I don't notice "egirl" threads because I don't spend my time looking for shit I don't want to look for.

>women suck and we're tired of it
>don't care about them or what they think
>so let's make every thread about them and never stop talking about them ever
Venting now and then is one thing, but I never really understood this.

something happened to me around 4:09pm on April 2, 2023. All the negative thoughts and feelings I had for the months prior felt like they had been lifted. This supported my own theories that something external was affecting my mental health. Now, that I've got that out of the way, it will take some time and experience to figure out whether it's caused by witchcraft, magick, demons, THE GOVERNMENT'S TECHONLOGY, or even possibly God.
The negative thoughts/feelings/mood was gone for a few weeks and then came back. Something similar happened to me a few years ago. It's caused by something EXTERNAL.

I remember some years ago I opened my bedroom window for the first time in months and I was just sitting in my computer chair and I felt so insanely good that it kind of freaked me out - the weight was lifted (temporarily)

That's one of the things I think it is.

Sunlight makes me feel better sometimes but fresh air by itself doesn't do shit for me.

What was that?

I'd never had that happen before either, it was really like I got high on fresh air (was over 25 at the time) but I've never had a reaction to fresh air like that again since. It was almost orgasmic, though more clean and pure feeling

It was around 5ish years ago and I had the same negative/bad feelings that I have now but after a spiritual cleansing it was 'removed'.
The healer said it was the evil eye but also possibly possession or somebody performed witchcraft on me.

I felt like that once after I left the gym after exercising and walked around on a warm sunny day. It does feel like you're high tho.
High on Life.

Have you read Prodigy from Mobb Deep' prison letters? He talks about negativity as an entity
I don't know if he know about Loosh farms before he wrote this or came to the same conclusion 
on his own but that's what it appears he's referencing to whether knowingly or unknowingly
here's when he talks about in his letter

I've heard of the Loosh farm but I believe it's way to abstract/mystical or theoretical. It could be that the entities farming for loosh are all demons.
This world isn't inherently evil, there are just evil entities within it, just as there are good entities. But besides that I agree with everything else.
Once you cleanse yourself of these negative energies, you will feel normal and happy and at many times very happy and carefree.

Yup. When you are being spiritually and emotionally drained only a sort of "cleansing" can bring you back to normality 
Or even make you feel better than you have ever felt before

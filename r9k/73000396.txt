You can it's dead easy, doesn't matter exactly what you're doing.
All you have to do is not slack but don't overwork yourself either and always stay calm when people (usually managers) are checking on how much work you have done.
Also learning to give positive but non-committal answers when asked to do things you don't have time for is a great thing to learn.
Remember it's all about the attitude so try not to let your insecurities control you, easier said that done I know but it makes everything so much easier.

Ok, if you don't have one this is not for you. But most people have a dad, but they are trying to get advice on dating and fucking from strangers. 
There is a guy with a similar appearance and genetics from you, and he managed to get a fuck and probably a wife. I understand that culture changes and things are different, but biology is the same, if you think females are genetically built in a way, that won't change in a single generation. Your dad had success, there is probably no reason for you to at least take his advice.
I myself, had a Chad dad. I have a similar look, but I have autism, so I cannot follow most of his advices, but as soon as I tried, things started to look better.
Talk with him anon, say "dad, I need advice with girls". The worst think that can happen is that you stay where you are now.

Lmao do you even know where you are ?
Half the people here are fatherless and either way it's horrible advice.
Most dad's will say retarded shit like "go get a job or study" because that's all it took to get a woman 40 years ago when nowadays most pussy is obtained by drug dealing criminal chads.
As for your case , only you have to do is go outside and have pussy jump on you if you really are chad you absolute retard.

Well, i actually followed my dad's advice, studied and got a job, it was worse than his, but it's alright.
I am not a Chad i think, i have the interest of girls now and then, but I had none before I could understand what I girl being interested in you meant, it's about confidence and will pass around if that means anything. Then even if I got an interested girl, i could not speak with her in any useful way, now i can, all thanks to my dad's advices. I'm just trying to help anon, it makes sense to me that he can give you better advice than incels. Just be honest with him.

let's be honest, most of us here are the result of absent or apathetic fathers. If we had dads to teach us this stuff when we were teenagers, we wouldn't be so lost

Talked with my dad, he teased me and called at me but he did tell me to chin up and the sort. Told me to do some good and work on what you need to do instead of needlessly sirtchasing, then they'll come to you, or something like that. and scolded me for not cooking the rice.

Ruined or improved?

Ruined. It's like it's trying way too hard, which is saying something when the scene already seemed that way.

It's trying to capture the girl's feeling of unworthiness which wouldn't be conveyed as well if you just translated it literally. Eh, I'd say improved.

wow that's the gayest thing i've seen all day and there was a bunch of faggots in the catalogue, good job!

Oh look, a Neo twewy thread.

Yeah i gotta admit that they tried too hard with nagi, wish they could have toned it back with their quirkiness.

Overall the game could've been a lot better, but I still liked it, especially the ending.

Just translate shit literally so weebs don't complain. It's a japanese story so it's a given that it's shit. Your translation won't fix it

they fucked up the right-to-left bubbles too. "here you go" doesn't mean "uh... yeah"

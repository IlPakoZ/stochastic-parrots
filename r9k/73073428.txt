kek why not use your notes if you had computer access? using chatgpt would give answers clearly not taken from the class. also every time i use chatgpt for technical topics it's wrong like 30% of the time, enjoy your C-!

I tried getting chatgpt to perform a simple fucking task for me so I could save like 2 minutes on an assignment and ended up spending 5 minutes fighting with chatgpt and failing it to get it to do what I wanted. Never again

chatgpt get's math problems wrong and it's really pissing me off

chatgpt does a pitch perfect simulation of a kind of stupid person googling something for you then making a book report

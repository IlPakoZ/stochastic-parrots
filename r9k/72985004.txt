>he really doesn't love me and it was all just in my head
i'm devastated but also it's cathartic at least now i know i actually was a pathetic cuck getting all hung up on someone who doesn't care
i'm free again wooo... well, i didn't want to be ;(

i'm not telling the whole story start to finish of how i became a faggot but i fell in love with a boy on the internet like a retard and i couldn't get over it but for him i was just another lover in a long line
i'm still not over it years later
i resisted him for months and even after we were talking every day for hours i wouldn't let it become sex
as soon as i started putting out he started to lose interest
now i'm a faggot i even had sex with a guy a little bit like him to check but he's gone
i've been stuck on him so long i can't even think about anyone else sexually
but now he's gone and he clearly doesn't want more he wont even reply to me when i'm begging
at least i never came out to my family

i'm totally pathetic but i already know that i just hoped maybe my feelings of love were reciprocated so i wasn't a complete cuck
i was ok with him not being some sort of virgin

did you ever communicate to him your feelings

the word begging wasn't hyperbole
if i didn't then i literally don't know how to
sometimes he would drop a crumb and i'd want to believe it means more than it does
i thought a shared playlist at least meant we were on speaking terms

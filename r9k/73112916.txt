I know plenty of people that drink loads and they're fine and they're over 40.

Both options are toxic to your body. What you really need is less toxins and more nutrients/microbes

Booze always made me feel better temporarily but then I'd start to feel like total shit once I started to sober up. Antidepressants don't treat my depression nearly as well but at least they don't have that huge negative side to them.

because intoxication is dangerous if you're depression or anxiety. 
at some point you'll realize that you dont have to deal with anything other than getting more substances to abuse and thats when you're fucked forever. stay sober for a month, a year, a decade, in your heart you know that you could get fucked up right now and all your problems would go away for a while. its like working out regularly, dieting or nofap. its a conscious choice you have to make every single day, even when you're low and every fiber of you dont want to do it anymore. can you stop jacking it for a year, even just to show that you can? can you work out 4-6 times a week following an actual program and diet for a year?

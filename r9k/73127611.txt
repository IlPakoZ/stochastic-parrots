>dota 2 lore
dota doesnt have any fucking lore. theres no story behind it
its a ripoff of a warcraft 3 mod
and i have over 2000 games as antimage, and i was in the top 100 antimages according to dotabuff at one point

yes, i am autistic
yes, i will farm the jungle the whole game
no, i will not participate in teamfights until i have my bfury, manta, and an item
no, im not joking

i know, i was barely 4k

i just played antimage all day, everyday. and i dont think being good at videogames is a flex? unless ur a legit pro or something

i quit that stupid game because i couldnt stand braindamaged peruvians, and i hated the fact that i hated my team. i hated the people i played with, so much, every game. i was always in the top 99% of most reported players, i just hated them

i didnt want to be like that, so i switched to csgo, and it was SO much better. the cs community is like heaven compared to the dota community. these days i play wow

here I am back again, instead of sleeping, I'm posting stupid threads. still a neet with no job, no degree and no gf. still feel like shit. still getting the chest pains.

I can't stop shake off this shitty feeling, no matter what I do. I always feel bad for myself. I failed uni, idk if I could've graduated if I'd worked harder. maybe I didn't had any chances anyways. whatever the answer may be, I can't stop myself feeling this awful feelings. I feel like a failure. I couldn't make a gf either. I always feel bad whenever I see a couple. tbf I haven't really meet anyone that I really wanna be with and there is little to no chances that I'll meet a girl like that. I'm hopeless.

tell me anons, is there a way to shake off these feelings?

Perhaps learning a new language would be entertaining?
For like a month I tried to learn German, but fell out of it because of other stuff. It was pretty fun, though.

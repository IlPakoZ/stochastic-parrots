Good evening, I ate the salmon earlier. No more salmon for me. Thank you though, dont sleep too late today

I will try to! I don't have any reason to stay up late today, unless for some reason I wanna stay up watching anime or something. Hopefully I have some self-control.

how are you inspiring us
--- 73096138
Why can't you freaks just talk in dms? Nobody wants to see this or even cares about you fags.
--- 73096193
>>73095236 (OP)
is sharing your love publicly in this manner something couples who are genuinely in love do?
especially in a place with suicidal virgins and people standing on the edge of life and death?

if i was in love with a girl, and she was literally the most absolute perfectly flawless girl imaginable, and she was so in love with me she is willing to kill herself just to make me happy, and we were a couple at the peak of our mutual infatuation

would bragging about it on r9k be something we do? let others into our personal lives, to judge us?
--- 73096203
>>73096138
No :D 
And I don't have Retard's and Salmongirl's contact info unfortunately.
--- 73096213

We're the inspiring lovey dovey ultra-romantic couple relative to most
>>73096138
We do talk in DMs but she's extra lovey today
>>73096193
When we're in mehico together we'll have some updates still
>>73096203
Tranny-kun is me for some reason lol, so she's salmon-san/retard-san/salmongirl/fishgirl.
--- 73096219
>>73096203
Why call my boyfriend retard...
--- 73096225
>>73096193
They are just trying to hurt others and feel superior because the bf feeds his ego by seeing/doing this. Oh well it gives me a place to post my cuts, look they even added another normalfag to their little group.
--- 73096243
>>73096225
they are just bullies through and theough. i asked kindly for him to stop bullying me but he says he'll only stop when he's bored. i understand your frustration desu, this duo is the meanest on the board

i also posted my cuts with you that one time, hello again. how have you been doing lately?
--- 73096247
>>73096213
>Tranny-kun is me for some reason lol, so she's salmon-san/retard-san/salmongirl/fishgirl
My bad, Trannykun!

>>73096219
Sorry, I got called him the wrong thing! I'll call him Trannykun from now on. Unless you have another suggesstion for what to call him.
--- 73096254
>>73096243
I am very hateful lately, someone that abused me a lot is in a happy relationship. I am so inherently unlovable literal child murders and serial rapists have easier times finding someone to connect with than me.

Do you two post in the cutting general?
--- 73096262

She's a malignant, sociopathic troll.
--- 73096287
>>73096243
>this duo is the meanest on the board
Not really lol. Also, you can extremely easily not respond to me. You know the shotacatboy poster? They ignore me now because they hate me/can't respond to my arguments, and it makes their threads too boring to post in.
If you stopped posting here to attention whore, you'd get 0 negative responses, also, obviously.
>>73096262
Why act fwenly to the manifesting bocchiposter who's a normalfag but not him? I don't get it.
>>73096267
She's not at all. She's a sweet angel! &lt;3
--- 73096297
>>73096287
They ignored me before and also I didnt realize they were as normal as they are. I do not know enough about that person to categorize them as a normalfag. My life is inherently less valuable than that of a serial killers.
--- 73096307
>>73096254
im sorry to hear that anon, what do you think makes you unlovable? im not very hateful anymore myself, but i remember how that can be. and hard as it is, you gotta ignore gatekeeper anon. he usually frustrates me to no end, but ive been trying to let the words slide off of me these days instead. however it does annoy me tons to see these brag threads up every single time i check the board, its nice to see someone else who understands how mean these two can be. it seems like every other poster thinks that theyre great people for some reason, when they post here only to hurt people
--- 73096327
>>73096213
i still don't see how this inspires us robots
at best i think this will inspire more normalfags, like we need more of those roaming around here
--- 73096339
>>73096287
i reply because otherwise you will just derail, also im bored and you always soak up all the (You)s by trying to hurt the posters here. i may as well respond to whoever is willing to talk to me, even if it often feels like talking to a brick wall with you
--- 73096357
>>73096307
I am mentally ill I assume. Normalfags can sniff it out it doesnt matter what I say or do, I genuinely wish the worst possible pain and suffering to every normalfag. My life is inherently valued less than someone who tortures and kills others if that person is interesting
--- 73096375
>>73096297
Being a robot/incel/insin doesn't mean you're less valuable than normalfags. Romantic/sexual approval doesn't necessarily imply a good character or a valuable contribution to the world.
>>73096327
What do you mean inspire normalfags?
>>73096339
You responding to me in your threads leads to less derailment? What posters am I trying to hurt?
--- 73096404
>>73096375
You said to me directly I am genetically inferior to you.
--- 73096428
>>73096404
Inferiority or superiority presupposes a goal in mind, and in this case, it'd be sexual/romantic success. I don't know if your genes are the problem or not. I don't know if you're genetically superior or inferior. Environment plays a very large role, of course, as well.
--- 73096437
>>73096428
Serial killers and violent criminals have more inherent worth than me
--- 73096452
>>73096339
His own girlfriend said in that "math conflict" thread that he's stubborn. It would really be for the best for Tranny-kun to see this as an issue that needs addressing if even his own demure 1950s housewife girlfriend says that he can be a pain.
--- 73096454
>>73096437
Doesn't that imply that romantic/sexual success doesn't tie to inherent worth? Given human garbage can still find love but plenty of moral good people can't.
--- 73096466
>>73096454
Morality does not exist. Normalfags like you are demons sent to torture me.
--- 73096491
>>73096452
I am stubborn. I'm not flawless, though it might seem that way.
>>73096466
Morality and "inherent worth" are both mental constructs, in my view. What do you mean demon?
--- 73096500
>>73096375
you two are just two normalfags who started dating each other through here, right? that's what i mean. sorry im esl. as a robot i just dont feel inspired by seeing two normies getting together. idk
--- 73096509
>>73096491
>I'm a borderline narc if not an outright narc but I have no desire to change but I have my head too far up my god damn ass to care
Fuck it, you're hopeless. Enjoy being a shitty person, faggot.
--- 73096510
>>73096375
because if i don't respond, everyone else will, and i won't be involved in the discussion at all anymore.
>>73096256
i used to but i stopped a while ago. why, do you?
>>73096452
it doesn't surprise me. honestly retard san seems like a much nicer person than her bf. at least she mostly sticks to her own threads. but at the same time all her threads are made solely to make robots feel more lonely and sad, so idk if its really any better
>>73096357
i see what you mean. what about just befriending only other non normalfags? althought its probably hard with all the wolfs in sheeps clothing around here
--- 73096519
>>73096491
The metaphorical term, you are all primarily concerned with torturing me or others. I genuinely wish you the worst.
--- 73096529
>>73096510
I have never met a non normalfag by my metric. I also do not have or want friends and never have.
--- 73096538
>>73096529
what would make you feel better then? i thought you wanted to be loved
>i have never met a non normalfag
even online?
--- 73096541
>>73096510
>i used to but i stopped a while ago. why, do you?
I have a friend who posts there, so I have a surface level of interest in that general.
--- 73096548
>>73096500
Some fauxbots should be inspired.
>>73096509
What am I supposed to do to change? I'm not just going to say you're right without an argument, and being stubborn doesn't mean narcissism.
>>73096510
>i won't be involved in the discussion at all anymore
That is a tragedy. Why can't you just farm attention off discord e-boys/simps?
>>73096519
Well I hope you find your ideal partner.
--- 73096588
>>73096541
ah i see. yeah i never was really a recognizable person in there, my posts never really were responded to, i probably dont know them
>>73096548
i dont have any simps or eboys. i only really talk to people if im streaming or playing vidya with them. why dont you go hang out with your gf instead of spending all day on here being a bully?
--- 73096604
>>73096538
I have been loved before it means nothing. I have always wanted to find someone or something I could love and been jealous of those that could love. 
>even online 
Yes, everyone has or wants friends.
--- 73096619
>>73096588
Your twitch viewers are simps, and I'm asking since you're complaining about being hated when you could snap up a bunch of guys to lick your feet whenever.
--- 73096649
>>73096548
No you dont you just want to feel morally superior. You are a sociopath
--- 73096656
>>73096604
oh, so you're the one unable to love. that sucks, im sorry to hear it. i hope that one day you can, there is still time
>>73096619
how are my twitch viewers simps? they're just people who are bored who want to watch a video game they enjoy. are the viewers of male twitch streamers also simps?
--- 73096682
>>73096619
by the way, how can seeing your gf brag about having a bf be inspiring? getting a partner, especially a gf from this board is very hard for most people. you guys got lucky, there is no real hard work involved in just happening to find someone you like and click with. if a real robot saw these posts, decided to work hard and inspire to be like you, odds are he wont find a gf here
--- 73096683
>>73096656
>there is still time
no there isnt. My ideal person is not real.
--- 73096703
>>73096682
I don't know either, it just makes me feel sad. Lol. I hate this dumb couple >:( go kill yourself transerkun and mermaidgirl
--- 73096712
>>73096703
You are a normalfag who is oversocialized and simps for cis women. You are worse than any farm animal.
--- 73096724
>>73096712
OK. Your feedback is appreciated.
>Mio poster is running out of images to post for the first time ever
--- 73096745

Who the fuck is mio
No but seriously go back to twitter or reddit
--- 73096749
>>73096682
by work hard i mean stuff like getting fit, getting a good paying job, etc. it doesn't increase the odds of getting a gf from here. especially not one who is similar to you, maybe could help get a turbonormie gf
>>73096683
what is your ideal person like?
>>73096703
i thoght you liked them though? why the change up. unless this is a larp or sarcasm
--- 73096754
>>73096749
An ironic joke or sarcasm I guess.
--- 73096759
>>73096656
They are simps, as well, but in a less overtly pathetic way. Both want to vy for the streamer's attention in most cases if they're chatting.
>>73096682
You don't have to find a true fembot gf to get a wholesome pure inspiring relationship.
>>73096712
Chill.
>>73096749
>doesn't increase the odds of getting a gf from here
Absolutely false lol. Why would women here not care about having a high income?
--- 73096766
>>73096745
>>73096712
i dont think that poster is bad? why do you dislike him? he is usually nice to everyone 

although i see that im defending him here when he would probably never do the same for me, hm is it wrong that i was upset about that
--- 73096777
>>73096759
>chill
nope. You never chilled harassing me.
>>73096766
He ignored me before. Also he is a normalfag.
 >>73096749
They are not human I guess because they are genuinely kind gentle and understanding
--- 73096779
>>73096548
>fauxbots
those are just normies, i thought you hated those. why inspire them?
--- 73096792
>>73096766
Should I defend people more often? I usually just let people be because I don't like getting into conflict. Very conflict-avoidant and wimpy, unfortunately. I notice and appreciate your defenses for me, though!
--- 73096803
>>73096777
>They are not human I guess because they are genuinely kind gentle and understanding
I met someone like this once.
--- 73096813
>>73096803
No you havent you lack the emotional capacity to recognize it to the degree I am talking of and to you a huge amount of people would be like that because it is relative and you are sociopathic
--- 73096818
>>73096759
its strange how you use words that dont make sense to the situation. a slut is a person who sleeps around. a simp is someone who gives money and gifts and loves someone for little to no attention in return. im not a slut and i dont have simps. people are bored and put on someone who plays a game they like, maybe they chat to have a convo about a character/etc that the streamer is using. there are such things as gray areas, i dont see why you can't understand that
>>73096754
oh i see. well what do you find inspiring about these posts then? you dont think it seems like bragging?
--- 73096819
>>73096792
Wait I would be a better friend if I stood up for people here wouldn't I?
--- 73096822
>>73096803
Really? I need to know more
--- 73096834
>>73096777
You realize the brown anime girl poster is a self-admitted attention whore, she's a slut, and she's a normalfag in like 500 different ways in your view?
>>73096779
I don't hate normalfags. I hate normalfags pretending to be robots, though, but finding a wholesome loving relationship makes the world better.
>>73096818
A slut is a casual sex haver. And a simp doesn't have to give money. Maybe they're more akin to lower-tier orbiters.
--- 73096846
>>73096818
>well what do you find inspiring about these posts then? you dont think it seems like bragging?
It does. You should see some of the replies I posted to their threads in the past, lol. I just like the couple. But I do hate how they keep bragging about it :/

>>73096813
I disagree, but I don't really want to go into detail about that person I met. Not here, at least.

>>73096822
I'm too lazy to link the thread where I will eventually talk about her if I had the time... maybe later, anon, if that thread is still up by the time I get home.
--- 73096857
>>73096834
>normalfags pretending to be robots
is this not what you meant by fauxbots? if it isnt then i dont know what else fauxbots could be
--- 73096872
>>73096834
they havent directly ignored or harassed me, though. They are female so they are automatically a normalfag though yes. 
>>73096846
>I disagree 
You dont even know the depth of what I am talking about so your words mean nothing
--- 73096873
>>73096818
>its strange how you use words that dont make sense to the situation.
Word salad and using words that don't make sense in the given context are a common NPD trait. Just a coincidence, I'm sure. :)
--- 73096883
>>73096872
>You dont even know the depth of what I am talking about so your words mean nothing
True. Greentext me your story, anon.
--- 73096897
>>73095472
>Now what shall I do with the free time I have?
Watch and read Kengan Ashura.
--- 73096904
>>73096857
I do hate fauxbots, yes, but I also want to inspire them.
>>73096873
>Word salad
Examples: none
>using words that don't make sense in the given context
I.e. disagreeing with me how a word is used.
--- 73096909
>>73096792
heh this is kinda a funny thread to be non confrontational in. it seems like a thread made to instigate arguments and to get a chance to talk down to/hurt others. but i get it, in irl i probably would be scared to have convos like these. and i guess we aren't close friends to the point where you should be upset by others saying mean things to me, i wouldnt expect that. but you seem like a nice person so i didnt want that anon to hate you for no reason
>>73096777
yeah, honestly its pretty impossible to find someone like that these days. i dont think id find someone who reached those standards either
>>73096834
call me whatever, but you're just ignoring the real definitions of words. 
>>73096873
kek
youre right
--- 73096911
>>73096883
>my story
As if I could express it to any degree just through words. so shallow.
--- 73096924
>>73096909
Words' meanings obviously change based on culture/subculture. A slut to a christian in the 1950s isn't just someone who sluts out all the time. A slut to a purity-obsessed place like /r9k/ will be stricter than it would be to redditors.
--- 73096928
>>73096909
I mean mostly I want someone similar to me who doesnt have or want friends but nobody is even like that
--- 73096951
>>73096924
Anon, I don't know what the point of me comparing with you is if you won't give me anything to work with. Agree to disagree, then.

>>73096909
>but you seem like a nice person so i didnt want that anon to hate you for no reason
I really appreciate that, Iris. Thank you. Have a cuddle shark.
--- 73096964
I really really really love my boyfriend and I want to be with him every day
--- 73096981
>>73096964
I want to be loved more than a serial killer but that will alas never happen
--- 73097008
>>73096981
You should attach an anime girl to your posts and keep doing it until someone thinks you're cute and falls in love, I think that works
--- 73097015
>>73097008
Then why hasn't it worked for me? :(
--- 73097024
>>73096924
it doesn't mean that a certain definition is more correct than others, though. and regardless of what you believe, what is the point of calling someone a slut over and over? why do you want to rally people to try and make them hate me? simply because when i was younger and more mentally ill i decided that i wanted to try it once to know what it felt like before dying? meanwhile youre assfucking your gf and having diaper fetishes, while claiming not to be a degenerate? look ill agree im a slut (to you, and anyone else who says so),sure im a normie because i have friends on the internet and could possibly get a bf on the internet in the future. honestly im not sure what you even want from me. just to call me names and turn people against me i guess. 
>>73096928
that was me a few years ago. but honestly i discovered that its more fun having friends who i'm not super close with, much more than just trusting and being close one person who most likely doesn't care about me, is using me, or will eventually turn on me and try to ruin my life
--- 73097025
>>73097015
You are looking for cis women.
>>73097008
If I become a serial killer will someone love me? just kidding I am too cowardly
--- 73097032
>>73097024
Sounds like you just conceded what you really wanted. Anyways you are a woman you were always a normalfag
--- 73097033
>>73097025
It's over isn't it ;-;
--- 73097047
>>73097015
You'll get yours eventually

>>73097025
I dont think killing people will get you a gf, not is it a good thing to do...
--- 73097048
>>73096951
thanks for the cuddle shark :) hugs for you
--- 73097051
>>73097024
>what is the point of calling someone a slut over and over?
It makes simps angry, and I'd prefer if every simp stopped being one.
>while claiming not to be a degenerate
I don't think I ever did this, and I don't care if you think I'm a degenerate lol. The diaper stuff is just a meme, though :^)
>>73097047
You're my cuddly forever!!! &lt;3
--- 73097052
>>73097033
For you I hope so. For me it has long since been over, I am looking for something radically different though.
--- 73097053
>>73097033
Its kinda true there aren't a lot of cis women on 4chan and a lot of the ones that are here have a lot of problems...
--- 73097061
>>73097052
:( Rude

>>73097053
My hopium keeps me going!! One day, I will find a fembot gf to love, cherish, kiss and cuddle!
--- 73097076
>>73097061
I prefer this mio.
--- 73097077
>>73097051
You keep spreading the diaper stuff everywhere and now everyone thinks I actually wear diapers
Well guess what
Ur a footfag (and its actually true! He loves my foot in his face!)
--- 73097083
>>73097032
sure, im a normalfag. it seems to make people very angry if i claim any different, so whatever, ill take it. 

and well, i just took the safer choice really. i understand that youre want what you want. i guess since im a girl i could find guys online to talk to and attempt that with more easily. but after all the failure i found that this is the more comfy and happy choice for me. i wish i could go back to being patient and loving enough for that, but its all risk no reward in my case
--- 73097088
>>73097076
She is not Mio, she is Waspgirl.
--- 73097094
>>73097032
Also by "few years ago" she means like in high school or otherwise was 16 and she's slutted out by 18.
>>73097077
You can enjoy cute feet without being a foot fag.

--- 73097106
>>73097047
I dont want a gf, I want something very different.
--- 73097124
>>73097083
I mean it is not me insulting you, just categorically as a woman you are one
--- 73097136
>>73097051
well, id prefer if simps stopped being one too. nobody should obsess over and love someone if the person doesnt care about them. but you dont need to take it out on me. calling me a slut over and over wont make simps stop existing. i dont even have simps anyways, not once has someone itt been on my side at all.
>>73097094
>>73097032
kek
well if thats what i get for wanting to defend and be on your side cutanon, so be it. i thought we had both been attacked and harassed by this anon, and were tired of being treated badly. but go on and join the couple in hating me for my one past mistake. sorry im not the perfect pure r9k gf for you or anyone
--- 73097138
>>73097106
Awww you want to be loved as a woman, I'm sure if you keep posting cute pics you'll get a guy with broken bird syndrome who wants to heal u
--- 73097148
>>73097136
I am not hating you for any decisions you made, I dont think I hate women I just dont interact with them generally. Its not really your fault. 
>>73097138
not what I meant. tranny moment
--- 73097151
>>73097124
if you say so, label me what you want and it will be true for you. everyone is entitled to their opinion.
--- 73097153
>>73097148
I thought u were trans so that's what I assumed. My bad then. 
I hope you get a bf who loves you dough
--- 73097159
>>73097104
I prefer qts with a good personality attached.
>>73097136
>not once has someone itt been on my side at all
Lmfao this isn't your thread, so of course. You obviously have simps. You might call them your friends who defend you and call you cute when you don't know their names of or they're just your fans or something, but that's what I mean by "simp".
>>73097148
What does the manga panel mean then?
--- 73097164
>>73097148
its alright
i wont keep trying to be friends with you or relate to you, i dont mind

not in a sarcastic way, i understand why you see me the way you do and its fair enough
--- 73097184
>>73097164
We cannot really relate to each other just different worlds. 
>>73097153
I am not. 
>>73097159
Thats just a random manga panel I picked
--- 73097193
>>73097159
of course i dont know the names of people who post anonymously on an anonymous imageboard. i usually can recognize certain typing styles/image postings though. and all the people who show up to my twitch (which is like 5 people) i know their names and we're friends
--- 73097209
>>73097159
Uhhh personality...?
--- 73097220
>>73097184
oh you're gay? well being a person who likes men doesn't put you too far away from my position... but sure understandable. i guess i seemed pathetic defending you and agreeing with you earlier when i guess you wouldn't see me as an equal or friend anyways
--- 73097229
>>73097193
If that was the extent of it, then maybe they're just orbiters who put you on a pedestal when you'd never touch them with a 100 meter pole or something like that. But I'd imagine there's a few who don't follow your twitch who are posting about anally masturbating to your twitch stream or something.
>>73097209
Yes, beyond having a big gun/mecha and the serious stare, like a loveable sweetheart like pic rel.
--- 73097256
>>73097220
I am not sure, I dislike cis women though.
You arent pathetic in my eyes, I dont have a value system to evaluate others, I never have had or wanted a friend so no you would never be my friend. I dont look at you negatively though outside of categorically as a normalfag
--- 73097259
>>73097229
oh wow, someone masturbates me for free, because they have some weird or specific fetish. they are totally an orbiter even if they have never once spoken to me or given me anything at all. im so thankful that i can have people masturbate to me, especially when they are hypothetical
--- 73097267
>>73097256
i see. well have a nice day then. ill stop bothering you with my cis female presence
--- 73097278
>>73097259
There are many depraved cultist followers, even though that was just a hypothetical example. I don't think you should be thankful for the depraved ones, but the fact is that you can get endless validation at a moment's notice due to these simps and they do actually exist lol.
--- 73097291
>>73097259
I am the cut anon but genuinely as a cis female you can have orbiters at will or. boyfriend at will if you put in effort. If you really want help with that I could give you advice.
--- 73097296
My bf is still the cutest and sweetest person in the world
I miss feeling his warm body, I want to snuggle up next to him, and see his loving smile. He has a beautiful smile and his eyes are so sweet and full of love. I love making him happy.
--- 73097300
>>73097278
where are these dpraved cultist followers! i wish that was true, if some people were so obsessed with me id be flattered. however when post, i usually get barely any replies outside of calling me a nigger and 1 actual kind genuine person. unless its a baitpost
--- 73097308
>>73095236 (OP)
god this LARP is retarded and I don't understand what the end goal is. One of those many fucking retarded ass long term LARPs you will do and then forget about because it does nothing.
--- 73097322
>>73097291
She knows she can pitifully easily get a bf lol.
>>73097296
You're the sweetest!!! I miss ur cuddles
>>73097300
Read the archives lol. There are many depraved simps. You could just make a thread asking "does anyone else masturbate to iris's twitch/pics?"
>actual kind genuine person
Doubt.
>>73097308
Many months of LARPing and getting both our hands involved. Tsk tsk, when will it end?
--- 73097326
>>73097308
>its a larp
>even doe we met up irl and held hands and cuddled and spent a week together and are going on a trip together and want to be with each other forever
--- 73097327
>>73097291
i dont want orbiters or simps. i think that they should not exist, and have real gfs or friends. as for a bf that's not my priority either. i like having my personal space and free time. i am pretty happy with my current situation, i only really need friends to play vidya with and have light and funny convos with. although i do miss the people i used to talk to regularly on threads here. maybe one day i will try for a bf but i feel like i would eventually get annoyed being constantly around someone
--- 73097339
>>73097327
If you are happy currently yes you cannot relate to me in any meaningful capacity
--- 73097340
Reminder that Tranny-kun used to have a thing for Iris before getting with Retard-san and began hating Iris (because she and her threads would get more attention than him or retard-san)
>inb4 denial and pretending it never happened
--- 73097343
>>73097326
you should open up a gofundme to fund your relationship i would give $2000
--- 73097352
>>73097340
Holy schizophrenic.
>>73097343
Why? Lol.
--- 73097357
>>73097352
And here's the denial everyone, like clockwork!
--- 73097360
>>73097343
lol why would you give me $2000? What do you mean find our relationship what would that money even go towards
--- 73097364
>>73097339
okay:)
of course there are bad days but if i could just have my room, my pc, and to stream thats all i want to be comfy and happy. maybe occasional alcohol or weed or something too. close relationships are just not worth
--- 73097383
>>73097357
Do you have any evidence, dough?
>>73097364
>close relationships are just not worth
Loneliest woman of all time. You're like the polar opposite of that guy lol.
--- 73097402
>>73097383
if he eventually gets into a relationship, he'll come to the same conclusion. last person i tried to be close with came on here and spread rumours and lies about me. the other one dropped me for a 15 yo. people are not good unless the time you spend with them is only casual, like playing vidya together. i used to be lonely, back when i thought that trying to find one person to be my only person forever was a viable option. but eventually youll all realize the truth
--- 73097420
>>73097402
Yes an 18 yo high school dropout who admittedly has never felt actual love has it figured out that all relationships are bad, actually.
--- 73097439
>>73097402
I have been in a relationship before for 8.5 years, I did not come to the same conclusion.
--- 73097446
>>73095236 (OP)
2w4s8
--- 73097454
>>73097420
lol im not a highschool drop out, ??. i graduated. and i doubt youve felt actual love either. ive been fooled into thinking i did but at the end of the day it was not. many people who think they're currently in love are just lying to themselves. but people can believe whatever they want, im not trying to convince anyone to follow my beliefs. im just saying how things are the way i see it. and that ive found im much happier now than when i was actively trying to find a bf or best friend
--- 73097474
>>73097446
She's actually a qt girl, dough.
>>73097454
>im not a highschool drop out
Oh.
Also what does "actual love" imply and how do you know you didn't really feel it?
--- 73097498
>>73097439
so you call me a normie, and say that you are not a normie? but you've had an irl partner for 8 years, meanwhile i have never been on a irl date. i dated people online and that was all. im not calling you a normie, but jeez. im a normie because potentially i could get simps if i abandoned my morals and scammed men, used them for money. and i could potentially get a bf, even though most likely we wont have true love or connection. well, whatever you say, label me as you please
--- 73097513
>>73097498
It was online only. And most of it was just me emotionally abusing her until she became an entirely different person basically
--- 73097531
>>73097513
you emotionally abused her?
and to think i sympathized with you. i guess i spoke too soon in those past threads where i defended you. eh i saw we both were cutters and been bullied by ops bf and felt like someone gets it. maybe i just should stop defending others altogether, i don't know why i feel the need to so often on here, especially people who dont care about or even like me
--- 73097549
>>73097531
not on purpose. She hurt me a lot too at any rate. I really dont regret it though I dont care all that much.
--- 73097574
*ahem*
YWNBAW

Thank you for your time.
--- 73097577
>>73097549
i dont know how you can have that happen for 8 years. i guess if i have one thing thats good about me is i can usually cut people loose if things get too bad. and how did you not meet up in all those 8 years?
--- 73097583
>>73097402
>but eventually youll all realize the truth

this sounds real edgy btw. something to think about, I highly doubt someone you were close with decided to post "rumours" about you unprovoked. You must have done something to provoke them but youre playing victim here.
--- 73097595
Iris makes another thread about herself
--- 73097596
>>73097577
They lived in a country that could not immigrate easily. I am glad they didnt though I wouldve strangled her.
--- 73097611
>>73097595
yes, just like gatekeeper anon makes my threads about himself :)

i wouldnt do it to someone who didnt do it to me first, constantly. if my threads have to be ruined by him, its only fair i do it back. i really wanted a comfy and friendly night, but i guess that doesn't happen here anymore
--- 73097618
>>73097611
His name is Tranny-kun and yes he is a nuisance
--- 73097631
>>73097596
i guess we really are very different then
>>73097583
the reason for it was me not giving him enough attention.
--- 73097635
>>73097574
She's a cute girl, dough.
>>73097611
>gatekeeper anon makes my threads about himself
I wish I had the power to do that lol.

Sadly off a bit.

lol
--- 73097678
>>73097650
How did you find that? lmao
>>73097653
Thanks, but I don't think I did that good of a job. Also, I always welcome haters to these threads.

You are gay
And that's okay
It's better to just say it outright

Holy samefagerinos

You know who you are

Yes they can idiot 
The science is settled. We are in a normal straight relationship

Retarded is what your boyfriend is, Tranny-kun. You are known as Tranny-kun and that is final.
>>73097758
SILENCE RETARD-SAN, TRANNY-KUN COME WRANGLE YOUR TARD AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC

Experts have confirmed she is, indeed, a cute girl. I trust them over random cyberchuds.

>Oh. I was making fun of the simps in that thread, dough.
Only really way i can prove the simpness is dms also this anti my game. To much work for the goal post moving. You just want to troll :3
>>73097786
She looks like a twink(hon) to me(only one pic to go off). Tho she has cuteness over me
--- 73097837
>>73097820
Are you trying to embarrass me or something? Lol. Also why do you think you know what she looks like?
--- 73097864
>>73097837
Saw a random thread on good old tttt. Some guy i know laying with some twinkhon who looks a bit like dr.peepee girl. Just got me thinking
--- 73097901
>>73097864
I genuinely have no clue what you're talking about. We never took any pic like that. Link the thread or mention a keyword in it and I can find it.
I also don't know what "dr.peepee girl" means lol.
--- 73097908
>>73097786
Except they haven't, Tranny-kun. Men are born with a penis and women are born with a vagina. Women produce estrogen naturally, they don't need an external method to have it. But I wouldn't expect a low IQ neanderthal such as yourself to ever understand. No point in trying to explain it to you any further really, consider this conversation over.
Oh and go change your boyfriends diaper. As his tard wrangler you should consider potty training him.

Tranny-kun is literally tranny adjacent. His mannerisms are so feminine. Just an attention-seeker through and through, its kind of sad. This whole thread is the deep end of the autism pool. Never take the dude seriously, just abandon the thread once he starts posting.

I know the guy pretty much looks like you and anything "off" could just be angle and light and 1 year of different. Just a lot of what you said about Makise Kurisue and i can see where in that pic she does look like that. Hair stuff could be hidden by bed.

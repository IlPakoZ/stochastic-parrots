Yes it is a meme virus for 80% of the population, but 20% is still a shit ton of people.

it seemed to range quite a lot in terms of symptoms for everyone

for me i had it for about a week or two and i could barely breath and felt fatigued
i could breathe, but it felt like breathing through a straw no matter how unstuffy my nose was, the oxygen was just not going through
it was a very unnerving experience for me but im glad it went away
it aint no meme cause millions died!!!

I just don't think about it but it does make me sad remembering what things used to smell like. And I'm always paranoid my room or I smell like shit now. I just clean a lot more.

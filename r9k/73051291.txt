How do I tame and befriend normalfags? I only watch anime, stuff like Sopranos and read manga. I cracked a joke at uni the other day and everyone looked at me weird. I tried pulling a Sopranos move and went like:
>"C'mon... I'm just breakin' balls!"
It didn't work.

There should be plenty of people into weeb stuff at unis. Find people into weeb stuff. If you try to do that with people you have absolutely nothing in common with, you may as well talk to a wall.

why do you want to befriend normies? you have nothing in common and would get frustrated, autistic and bored around them

To be fair, who else would you befriend?

I totally get that, but I still need normie acquaintances for some networking. I don't really wanna be "real" friends with them, for they are scum.

If that's the case, you'll have to learn things about their interests. It's not like normies don't do that.

Entry level higher art or only moderately successful pre 2000s media is a good place to start with sounding out normies. Most normies will be into this sort of thing, because it's slightly eccentric but still socially acceptable. Test the waters by dropping some pretty noticable references to the aforementioned stuff, but don't build up to it, and don't deliver it with any emphasis. Repeat this until they ask you about it. Alternatively, you can flat out ask them about it, but if they're a turbonormie/actual human, they'll think you're a wierdo/normie (respectively). Always remember that normies admire and envy those who live outside of their norms, but don't directly violate them. For instance, normies find people who don't have social media captivating, but raving about the shortfalls of social media is a sin.
Good luck anon.

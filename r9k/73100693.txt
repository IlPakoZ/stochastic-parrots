In short, my ex and I have kept in occasional contact since we broke up. This was a mistake as she has behaved like a bitch throughout the whole process. Recently we had a conversation that went so bad that there is no going back, we can't even be friends anymore. I will soon be moving out of the city for family issues which is a perfect opportunity to leave behind everything that has to do with her. On the other hand, I could just slam the door on my way out. I could behave like a spiteful bitch too and show her friends how she spoke ill of them or reveal to her sister that she's envious of her. I know that doing so would leave me at the level of walking garbage, but it's legal and to some extent she deserves it for being two-faced with everyone. I also know that slamming doors is generally not a good idea and in the long run it will only feed me with resentment. Facing things with dignity will help me to sleep more peacefully, but doing the opposite is really tempting...

Why do you think this is a good place to ask advice for normie relationship drama?

normalfags don't respect this place's culture anymore and there aren't enough robots to counteract any of it

Didn't remember that place was a thing. Thanks, my logic was that if even in this woman-hating place the robots tell me it's a bad idea then it definitely is.

Sounds like something a couple of narcissists would do

Be a man, just walk out quietly.
Even if you spoke poorly about her nobody would believe you.
Just walk out

That's not really an issue, I have chats and know shit I'm not supposed to. The problem is everything else.

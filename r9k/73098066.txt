I don't think you understand how easy you have it. You could easily lose ALL of that if you were waterfasting for a month and 3 days. You just need to require willpower and convince yourself you don't like eating lard anymore.

Lose weight gradually. Do the recomp diet and do diet breaks every once in a while.

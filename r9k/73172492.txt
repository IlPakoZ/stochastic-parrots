Is it really that easy to get a gf like you normies say? Or is it just gaslighting to make us believe we are bad people for failing?

I work as a janitor, I am not attractive, my tinder profile is basically futile unless I lie, but I see people in my strata get gfs and wives. So what do I do? What steps can I take to get a gf besides the usual meme answers like "shower 5 times a day"? People in general are incredibly cold and callous towards me, I try my best not to be too quiet and when I talk I try not to be too cringe, but people end up not wanting anything to do with me anyway. I struggle to make friends let alone a gf. Women under 35 will certainly have zero interest in me.

Do I have to LARP as a gangsta like all the other normies? I have zero interest in normy pop culture and I can barely scrape together a few hours of socializing a week to learn real social skills.

What do I do specifically? Join a tango class? What? I literally have no idea. What are all these other people doing? I would ask them, but everyone socially ostracizes me for reasons unknown. I merely humbly ask for a few pointers. If it is so easy, as you claim, then you should have some.

It's pretty easy for normies. The species would have gone extinct if we didn't naturally want to couple and group up and have kids with each other.

However, there's no reason the species can't thrive with a fair number of totally failed offspring, who so totally fail to be appealing, so totally fail to tap into the evolutionarily coded desire to partner up and fuck, that they just never make it work.

It's easy for the normies because they're all fluently speaking to each other in a language you can maybe, at best, fake a few phrases in.

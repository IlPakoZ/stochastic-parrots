In a poll in a Japanese newspaper two months ago, the results of the countries that Japanese women want to visit the most were South Korea ranked 1st, France ranked 2nd, and Italy ranked 3rd. No sane woman wants to go to a third world shithole like India.

Idk if this is for sex tourism though. 
Taiwan france italy and hawaii both made it in the top five for both sexes.

You want to look for the differences. Like men wanting to go to new york and spain vs the women wanting to go to thailand and singapore.

Most people usually go to India for spiritual reasons. Kinda like a modern day pilgrimage. Agreed though, it isn't very vacationy though. Plus, I think one of the more popular Buddhist schools in the US would be Zen, and that moreso correlates with locations in both China and Japan.

During the Fukushima earthquake in Japan, Japanese shops and ATMs were robbed and stolen by numerous thieves. If South Korea is third world because of the theft of some such accessories, is Japan fifth world?

Ive been to third world shitholes before and they try their best to keep their countries at least a little bit clean, not jeets though

Yes, but it was Generation Z that was polled. Literal, unironic zoomers. We all know their opinions, even in other countries, are totally meaningless. Probably influenced by Kpop niggers on TikTok or some shit.

i'm from south korea
for some reason, japanese girls have fantasies about south korean boys
and there are many things that japanese young girls like and care about in south korea (cosmetics, aesthetics, foods, cafes etc) so they like south korea
it's just because of these things
and i've never heard of the japanese people hating india or indians
what they really hate is china and chinese people though
in universal survey, the percentage of south koreans and japanese who like and dislike each other's country is exactly the same
but in the same survey, more than 95% of japanese citizens hate china

as a common south korean boy in his early 20s
i can say that we are not more romantic, sweet or cute than other boys 
we are just autistic and fairly dependent on our mums 
however, japanese girls and other asian girls are immersed in our tv shows, movies, music, etc
so they believe that we are like boys in our media
asian girls are too simple and naive
they do believe what they see on tv

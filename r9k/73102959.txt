Meaghan I will talk to you somehow I'll keep reaching out in new ways. It's funny that you were never the one to call cops on me. Just that loser living with his mommy I just need you to come back and talk to me. There's only one way this can end

--- 73103007
b>>73102968
Because the file names are randomized before I post them so people can't follow me when I'm not posting myself
--- 73104008
I only have been tortured by everyone I've ever met when all I ever wanted was happiness and to not be alone

I did have sexual relations with meaghan we were together for 2 years and we made love every time we were together. The first time she met me after talking for months and we finally met up we had sex and held eachother every time I talked to her it made me happy knowing that she could only forever be mine because we only ever had eachother
--- 73104326
Just one person to spend time with forever and make eachother happy that is all I ever asked for

You're pining after a girl by posting on r9k, that speaks for itself.
--- 73105328
Have you considered that this Meaghan is a human like you and has a right to choose who she wants to associate with like you do?

Romanticizing and putting this person on a pedestal is a form of dehumanization to justify your shitty behavior. Have you considered that she didn't call the cops herself because she's afraid of you and just wants to move on with her life?

Putting all morality and reason behind, you're a human too and deserve at least some form of happiness. It's not going to work, you're not gonna win here and you're only torturing yourself by continuing your pursuit. 

Consider getting help.

I hope he kills her desu
--- 73105345
>>73104167
Absolutely DISGUSTING. Kys pedo
--- 73105427
>>73105328
Nope she wanted to marry me and kept telling me she loves me very much days before disappearing and the fact that she wouldn't even talk on the phone after was too strange every that happened is too strange. The person that called the cops did it because I was angry at him specifically and would indeed commit murder against them if I see they're even involved with her. 
>>73105345
The only crime I ever committed was missing court for a traffic ticket I've never done anything awful. You fuckers need to get real
--- 73105447
>>73105427
Why are there multiple mugshots then?
I know you've been arrested in at least 2 different states
--- 73105483
>>73105427

Actions can speak much louder then words, and I feel like there's something you're not telling us about this whole situation.

If it truly was the loving relationship you say it was then why did she leave suddenly, and why won't she talk to you now?

>>73105447

I'm by no means a face expert or anything, but the mugshot guy has a really pudgy round face, while op seems to have a more pointed thin face. Doesn't look like the same guy to me

I could be wrong though, I'm no expert.
--- 73105521
>>73105427
You probably stalked her or threatened her. Shes AFRAID of you.
--- 73105610
>>73105521
I did none of those things
>>73105483
I haven't left anything out. The only thing that was kinda retarded was the last night we were driving together and she was scared of the rain and scared I would crash or something for unknown reasons and would slap my hand away when I tried to comfort her... I never saw someone be so scared of rain like that
--- 73105653
>>73105610
>I never saw someone so scared of rain like that 
YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE RETARD. She is afraid of..YOU.
--- 73105716
you guys are soooo dumb according to op last night during the podcast we had on kick.com/leafy he's a professional model and those were taken from one of his photoshoots
--- 73105854
>>73105610

Sounds like PTSD, or a mental breakdown of some kind. 

The fact that you call this retarded is a big red flag as well, I'm referring to you seeing your spouse in such a state of address, and considering it an annoyance.

I think you might be delusional. I'm not saying that to insult you, in fact I'm trying to help you.

I suggest you take a long look at yourself. Try to look from the perspective of someone outside looking in.

I STRONGLY suggest that you seek proper therapy, as a therapist can help you work through these problems and delusions in a safe and healthy way. 

You are not going to get any kindness or help in this place. If you want help you're going to need to seek it out yourself. 

I hope you consider my words and take them to heart, both for your sake, and the girls.
--- 73105892
>>73105854
I say it was retarded and I was just very concerned about her being so upset not annoyed. Humans can't just understand things that aren't a normal occurrence in their lives I've always done my best dor her and even now I'm trying
--- 73105922
>>73105892

I think there's something there you aren't seeing, and I think if you go to a therapist and be open and honest with him/her, you can not only get some closure, but also grow as a person and move on from this all the stronger.

Even if you don't do that, you should respect her wishes and leave the girl alone. It's very clear that she does not want to see you, and threatening people, as you already know, is only going to get you into trouble.

If you truly care for this girl, then you should move on for her sake. Respect her wishes.

If you don't care for this girl, then move on for yourself. All that's going to end up happening from you pursuing this is jail. I've been to jail myself, it is not fun. Let it go and move on, you'll be much happier for it in the end.
--- 73105959
>>73105922
I'll only be happy when she talks to me about things and we can talk to eachother talking to a random kike therapist won't help the only thing that actually would make any difference is talking to her because it leave with both of us being happy
--- 73105980
the love you have for meaghan is sweet i hope you reunite one day. it reminds me of how much my boyfriend loves me from another perspective and makes me want to improve for him
--- 73105992
>>73105959

You're delusional. You're not seeing things clearly.

Also the whole kike thing shows me that you are not a good person. You need to reconsider where you are in life.

I don't see anything I'm saying getting through to you, so I'm going to move on.

I hope you get the help you need, and are able to grow as a person.

>>73105992
Sorry I'm not a delusional liberal I only believe In real things and "therapist" are just grifters. Only communication between us can solve things and bring people together. Creating more mental illness and ghosting will never be ok for either person and I know how much not talking to me puts pain onto her too. This world is fucked up
--- 73106066
>>73105980
Thanks I'll keep trying I've never cared so much for someone before so I've always tried everything I could manage for her

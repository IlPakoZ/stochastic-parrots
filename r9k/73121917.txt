I don't need to have sex, nobody needs to have sex. Sex is a pleasurable experience not dissimilar from other pleasurable experiences. You can be happy without sex, just as you can be happy without masturbation or alcohol.
What I've really been working on not wanting is love.

You are an asexual freak and don't represent the average man. Stop trying to shill your mental illness here it's getting annoying.

I may not represent the average man but I represent myself based on my own experiences.
If you believe you need to have sex regularly in order to be happy you're in a hole you've dug for yourself.

I need to have sex regularly cause I have a libido.
You don't have one cause you are a castrated asexual freak, you have 0 test which is obviously the reason why you get no gf either. You wouldn't get one even if you looked good. Die alone mentally ill fag.

You are just coping though. Being sexless is the fastest way to become a bitter faggot. I should know

You want to have sex regularly because you have a libido, that's fine and healthy, but is that your end goal? In an ideal world are you just fucking 24/7? There are other equally important ways you can spend your time.

What is life if not coping with one problem until you can cope with the next?

this is easily a 10/10 woman in my opinion.
Though, I should knock a point since apparently an image of her nude exists online.

1) I'm not the person you were initially responding to.
2) I'm not asexual

I replied to you because you strike me as an immature idiot. "I need to have sex because I have a libido", what are you, 14...
There are more things to life than just sex, and sex isn't even the most fulfilling part of a relationship.
Sex is so meaningless these days, it's 2023, just go into the city at night and have sex.
It's nothingness.

The real joys of life come from marriage, family, children, and pursuing passions. You are probably just a horny edgy teenager who thinks that they need to have sex right away or something like that. Mostly all teenage boys are like that. Hopefully you will grow out of it since you are on this website but chances are you're just a normie who will turn into some 20s low IQ fuckboy lol.

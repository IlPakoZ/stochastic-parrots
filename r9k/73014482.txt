Man, the real test of leadership is getting people to belt out a song about murder and be happy about it instead of bitching about your leadership. They got some unresolved problems they want to bring up but they aint going to say it and bitch about other things instead. Like Yell about killing mother fuckers while we're fuckin' walkin'. It's like how fuckin' hard is that? You're getting fucking paid to do it.

Nah fuck that. That's easy, you can just drop aggression hormones and lose yourself. Actual good leadership is a little more complicated, you're mixing aggression with compassion, different cocktail of social hormones

It's mixing intense care for and affection towards the people who are relying upon you against intense aggression towards the people who are trying to hurt them, combined with the psychological acuity to do that job effectively

Autistic females are either sexless volcels or degenerate cumsluts. There is no in-between.

i'm definitely a huge slut lol
--- 73128447
lmao i feel called out. i talked to robots all the time and they expect me to be a pure innocent virgin since i'm mega autistic but nope lol.

>>73128414 (OP)
This is very true itt. Honestly, the fact that autistic femcels often have so many relationships is the gold standard for proof that women play on ezmode. Being an ugly, autistic guy is hellmode, doubly so if they're not smart

>sexless volcels
I'd be fine with that if they actually shared my interests and liked me. Never seems to be the case.

You too, nipples where we can see em

I honestly think the latter is a meme
--- 73128891

Age and bodycount? Also, is buying you a drink in a bar enough to get into your panties?
--- 73128917

How so? They try even harder to fit in compared to normal girls.
--- 73129075
>>73128891
21, body count of 50+ i think.
>is buying you a drink in a bar enough to get into your panties?
if you're hot and tall, i'll grab your hand take you to the bathroom and suck your cock right there ahaha. if not, nah. sorry

would autistic women be okay with a virgin bf?
--- 73129631

But I'm literally in between those

0 effort larp.
--- 73129693
>>73129631
Most guys don't get laid all that much (average around here for the non-virgins is probably 2 or 3 gfs) so your idea of what's in between celibate vs. slutty is going to be a lot more slutty than their idea.
--- 73129750
>>73129435
fuck no lmao. 1341
--- 73129791
>>73129750
oh okay sorry. why the preference for non virgins if you dont mind me asking? idk about all virgins but i would be willing to learn how to get good at sex
--- 73129845
>>73129791
Not that anon but it's the same reason no one wants to hire someone with zero experience over someone with a degree and 10 years industry experience.
"I can learn on the job" isn't very reassuring.
--- 73130133
>>73129791
I am not her but I would say all but one virgin I dated was all around terrible in a relationship. Sex is actually fine usually
--- 73130296
>>73130133
What made them so bad? I would try really hard to make the relationship good if I ever get one.
--- 73130534
>>73130296
It was a combination of things. Usually being emotionally volatile, a lack of empathy or just in general not knowing how to interact with people, and just being incredibly possessive with me and my time
--- 73130578
>>73129435
im autistic and i would not mind a virgin bf, though i would be a bit afraid they would get fomo of other women
--- 73130630
>>73130534
Honestly that sounds like it would be me other than the lack of empathy :( I take it that the one virgin you were with that wasn't bad at relationships didn't have these traits?

>>73130578
oh I can't speak for all virgins of course but I know that I would be loyal no matter what. I really want to marry one day.
--- 73130677
>>73130630
>didn't have these traits?
Not really. That one was genuinely warm and pleasant to be around even if we didn't have much in common. They had a good group of friends, so I think that helped them with just knowing how to deal with and treat people
--- 73130706
>>73130578
I'm a virgin and the thought my partner might get that FOMO worries me, but the thought I might get that despite thinking myself better than that absolutely terrifies me. Luckily I'll never have to worry about that, I'll be alone until I inevitably rope myself haha, phew.
--- 73130744
Just don't get an autistic gf. Simple as that
--- 73130752
>>73130744
noooooo get one get one
--- 73130767
>>73130677
Oh I see. I have a group of friends, but to be honest I don't know how I'd do in a relationship. I do think I would be a bit clingy and feel a bit anxious if she wanted to spend time with others without me. Most people probably overcome those feelings in early relationships when they are young, but I never had any.

>>73130578
Would u let ur bf cuck u just to scratch that itch?
--- 73130787
>>73130752
It's not fucking worth it. I dated one last year and it was more stressful than every job I've had
--- 73130828
>>73130706
It's a culturally wrong idea. Statistically, virgins are less likely to stray in relationships.
--- 73130829
>>73130534
I'd be emotionally volitile if I knew the girl I was with was with over 10 strangers. You don't have to be a non virgin to not know social cues and what people like
--- 73130873
>>73130829
If I thought someone's circumstances would make me act like that, then I would just, you kjnow, not date them
--- 73130905
>>73130873
A lot of the time you find out after you started dating
--- 73130949
>>73130905
Not that Anon but I knew before hand but I was nice enough to give her a chance. Turns out she was too nice to have anything bad happen to her to make her do what she did. I always thought that girls that got around always had something really fucked up happen to them but i learned last year i learned college girls could get into a promiscuous life on a whim
--- 73130953
>>73130905
If it's a big deal for you, then it should be one of the first things you figure out before you commit, or just break up with them if you can't handle it

I think the categories don't really fit for girls. When an incel is defined as a person who can't find a sexual partner, girls are not incels because they could. That, of course completely ignore the different sexuality of females. No women would want to have sex with just a random stranger. A penis itself is not desireable for a woman. She always needs to find the man attractive in some way. That doesn't need to be about looks, it can be his personality as well. But ok, girls are not incels, even if they're alone and frustrated. They can be volcels when they just don't want sex. That happens, but it's rare I would say. A girl must be 100% asexuel to really don't care about anything physical. Most lonely girls are therefore not volcels. They are lonely girls. They haven't found a man to love, in best case to marry, and they don't want to be slutty and just jump in the beds of some good looking or rich men. So the categories of incel and volcel, that are made for men, don't really work for women. What could be the term for a lonely virgin girl? Romantic-female, romfems ... but that's to close to radfems, and most girls don't want to be confused with raging dykes. Femcons, female conservatives ... but it's not really a political issue. In earlier times it was called maiden, but that term doesn't work any more. So maybe you can come up with some ideas.

Sexless volcel until I met my sexless volcel husband. By sheer luck I met someone who was not put off by my autism and a recluse like me. It only sucks that I now have a strong sex drive or feel "slutty" now that I'm comfortable with him, and he's indifferent to sex and never really participates. Actual pillow princess. I'm fine with doing the work 95% of the time, but fuck, I'd like to be touched or edged every once in a while. It makes me feel repulsive and depressed. I think men have it on easy mode. All you have to do is stroke it to looking at something and you'll cum. For a female, it's heavily phycological and requires a man responding to your body language, as well as displaying certain signs of interest as well. I've always been ignored or flatly mocked if I even remotely hinted interest towards a guy. I can't get relief from masturbating. I feel nothing physically. It's the size difference, his smell, and I would imagine the warmth of his touch that would actually put me into a state where I could. I haven't had those feelings since I was 13 and could only achieve it though reading shit like fanfics. Real men show no emotion on their face and don't want to get to know you outside of a superficial level, so the thought of a real man makes it impossible to cum.

Absolutely depressing.
--- 73131178

Have you considered that he is actually the autistic one and thats why he doesnt like sex that much?
--- 73131200

Only if you lick my cum out of her afterwards, of course.

Oh, he likes sex, just not participating other than immediate PIV without foreplay when he gets frustrated from me "stimulating him." There's usually a back-forth of touching with any normal healthy couple, but dude just sits there and eats grapes. His excuse when I communicate this to him is he was a virgin before he met me. And? So was I. but I still touch you. He definitely does not have autism and knows how to socialize pretty well and read facial/verbal cues, I have to rely on him sometimes. He just prefers to spend his life indoors playing vidya like 99% of Zoomies.

My current gf is autistic. She's annoying AF, but she gives me that ass anytime I want, and she's usually enthusiastic about it.

Love it, I need more autists gfs with big asses.

it's generally agreed upon between femcels that it doesn't refer to a woman that can't get sex, but rather a woman that can't get a relationship

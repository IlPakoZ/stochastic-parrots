yep, i had the same experience but IRL at university years ago with height. we'd be flirting and getting along great but the id try to take it farther and it would be "i cant see myself in heels beside you" or some such variation

of course looks matter silly boi.. do you have style? most of u arent exactly ugly, most of you are normal but have terrible styles, terrible facial expressions and take the most horrendous creepy pics (blurry, strange angles).

>>73005410 (OP)
yeah, though honestly for the most part being thin is the most important thing.
even if you're ugly if you're thin you have an upper hand.
do you wash your face, anon?

>>73005435

My looks have not deteriorated at all but I can't get girls to talk to me online anymore once they hear my age starts with a 3.
--- 73005626
>>73005551
even girls in their mid 20s+?
--- 73005687
>>73005626
I'm sure they would be ok with it but I haven't encountered many. I suspect the reason is the clock is ticking for them and they're looking for $$ and commitment.

>>73005687
are you not looking for long term? just casual dating?
maybe just be upfront with your age immediately.
--- 73005793
>>73005745
I am upfront. I don't make it to the looking for anything stage. I don't make it past the "hi how are you" stage with girls online once age comes up.

Like I said, I don't look old and will do just fine IRL. I'm a busy guy with things to do though and don't have time to actively search IRL. It would be nice to throw out a line online and see what happens during my downtime but as I mentioned, it hasn't been working.

Bitches don't care how you look. Just that you treat them right.

find girl, offer nitro or electronic money, buy nudes, pray for real girl. 

BEWARE! MOST ARE SCAMMERS

Looks do matter OP thank you for speaking the gospel

You're ugly. By definition you're not attractive, but repellent. Deal with it and move on.

>>73005410 (OP)
I think I have the opposite of this
>show face on discord
>get called cute
>they start messaging me
>I message back
>within 10 minutes through the power of tism fuck it up

It's just the results of feminism, birth control, and online hypergamy. The average guy has to jump through an insane amount of hoops in 2023 to get his looksmatch gf compared to 20, 40, or even 100 years ago. There has never been a better time to be a woman or high status male, and never a worse time to be an average guy in the west barring dying in literal war.

Because it represents what we hate about female nature, the subjectivity and fickleness of it. It's the same reason a lot of women hate porn.

As a rock and boulder appreciator, I can understand females who appreciate crystals. It's like a rock but girlier.

Because its dumb and aesthetically trash, native Americans did have spiritual ideas related to crystals but its ruined by white people. The issue with new ageism is that its a shallow and materialistic view of religion, and I think thats why zodiac and crystals truly annoy us (aside from many men thinking its dumb and illogical), because it reflects the feminine desire to appear as something with no substance - aesthetic as identity. Girls identify so much behind their zodiac signs, but there is no substance behind their identity (what annoys us so especially is when a girl says you are sooo X, when their whole idea of X is from a blog instead of lived experience), girls like to feel spiritual with their crystal bullshit but their entire spirituality is showing off their crystals and buying them for purely material gain - nothing genuine about any of this stuff, its all vain. It annoys us because this reflects the shallow and ultra social nature of women that we constantly see, constantly judging via bullshit like zodiacs or spiritually thinking have a nice crystal is deep. And its fruitiness that annoys us, guys get turned on by girls in frilly dresses or girls who are sluttilly dressed - that sort of femininity. The Dove, YAAASS, umm banum, live laugh love femininity just annoys men in an instinctual level just like how girls get annoyed at lad and broish sort of stuff. 

The more logically inclined guys also get annoyed at this stuff because its illogical, how is a crystal thats formed by rock crushing together for millions of years supposed to have any inherent power? Especially when they are arbitrarily given? How do star signs have anything to do with personality? Now I believe in the supernatural, I am not inclined to a material or logic way of thinking, though I used to be more logical and skeptical (never atheist) and that was my thought process; it even supernaturally didnt make sense, because it didnt follow any consistent supernatural logic

>Avoiding sleep to the point you pass out on your chair because you know sleep is the bridge that connects your "free time" to slavery, and as soon as you wake up, you are in for another ride
Can anybody relate to this?

yeah i guess. although it's also a period of release from the greyly dislocated horror of existence too

passing out in your chair computer is pretty hardcore
I've had it happen here and there over the years and when you wake up you're like "what the fuck"

>"what the fuck"
Indeed, and quickly followed by immense neck/back pain, just to realize you are awake to slave another day.

I had a similar experience in school. I would procrastinate falling asleep, i would masturbate, listen to music, and straight-up lie in bed thinking, on the verge of sleep and lucidity. I also woke up 1-2 hours before i had to get out of bed, so i could harden myself before getting up, and to increase that half-lucid dream-like state where thoughts become images.
I would also get obsessed with counting and saving time. 
Now i'm a neet and i love sleeping, i sleep 9-10 hours a day, i fall asleep immediately whenever i want, even if the sun is shining directly into my face. But i still love the half-lucid state after waking up.
only answered because of monogatari pic btw

I usually write down these dreams, to be a reminder of why I m the way I m.

Even after a good night sleep (8 to 10 hours) it still takes me over an hour to actually "wake up", in that time there is a lot of yawning and eye watering..I don't know where the eye watering comes from, will take a big yawn/breath and the eyes just well up with water..It's actually kind of refreshing, like each time your eyes get watery, you feel a bit more awake - will have this happen like 3 or 4 times before I'm finally ready to get out of bed

Absolutely. I've actually reached the point where I enjoy insomnia at work because it forces me to disassociate from my anxiety and everything I hate about it. Sometimes I'll take diphenhydramine just to be drowsy at work so my higher brain function shuts off.

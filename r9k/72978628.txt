It's because they hate me and want me to be sad

Who are these "people"? Not that I care about whether or not you diss men, I have a low view of humans in general.

Sorry that happened to you. I wish I could do that without it being traumatizing to the kid.

I'm sorry you feel this way but I am good and would make you feel you can trust men again.

most men are not compatible with civilized society. case in point

I agree that women are more peaceful, rational, and intelligent. But I think we still have a role to fulfil. I am good at my job in IT and get great joy from serving people, women in particular. They're always very nice to me you see.

women are not more peaceful rational or intelligent, they're just not as openly depraved or physically destructive as men.

But you can do nothing about it. i will sleep in my comfy bed and you can get raped by a pack of moids the moment you go outside.
how are you still breathing if men are that dangerous desu?

Im sure there is probably a little more to it

You would struggle to kill yourself with whisky, maybe Everclear and even then you would most likely just vomit.

Yes, you can literally just go the store and buy it.

Just because alcohol is shit it doesn't make weed any less shit

do you not know what alcohol poisoning is

yeah if you're one of those people who drink a bottle of whiskey and just fucking die.
every year some teenager drink themselves to death on mediocre amounts of alcohol. think its something with their brain or heart that nobody noticed before.
just because its hard to die from weed doesn't mean its good for you tho. people with shizo tendencies for example needs to stay away from that shit.

it's possible to do it if you're one of those freaks who gives themselves a liquor enema, it goes more or less directly into your bloodstream without giving your body any time at all to fire up the metabolism machinery for scrubbing it out.

there's a big risk that you survive for days or even weeks but with severe brain damage and you just suffer for ages before dying, or you survive and are just a potato forever

Plenty of people have died in their sleep after mixing it with pills, so probably. Or DUIs. Or liver failure. Either way it's not the alcohol itself that is the problem ans that's true for all drugs. It's just that some are deadlier than others.

not as common these days unless its heart medicine or something along those lines.
its mostly a myth that lingers from the time they prescibed barbiturates as sleeping pills, epileptic meds or anxiety meds. just taking 4 more than you were supposed to was enough to kill some people, mixing them with alcohol at all was russian roulette.

yeah i found out i had the schizo tendencies by smoking weed. for some fucking reason i was blind to it before. my delusions got way worse until the weed just gave me giga anxiety to the point where i sat in the corner of my room with the lights on staring at my hands right in front of me so i wouldn't see anything else. could swear i was hearing my mom talk shit about me downstairs. started remembering shit i hadn't thinked about for a decade. 
once heard someone explain that after two years you're a new person but there is never a point in those two years that you suddenly change, to me it is, every 6 months or so i feel like i've been on autopilot my entire life and just now regain the ability to have lucid thoughts.

I have never heard an intelligent take against weed or Rogan for that matter. only an NPC would despise both

People downplay the effects of weed all the fucking time. It can severely enhance underlying mental disorders you have, like making you more anxious, depressed, turn you into an insomniac (shrinkage of the pineal gland). 
It can become physically addictive for those reasons, and it becomes a loop where you think you need to smoke it every day to be happy, but it just makes shit worse.

No it's not that easy to kill yourself with liquor. 99.9% of the time you will survive even if you drink way too much. I've seen a teenager take like 25-30 shots of tequila in 5 minutes and live

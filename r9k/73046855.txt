any cocteau twins fans here?

I doubt anyone actually enjoys that sort of music and just forces themselves to listen to it to feel like a "real goth" whatever that means. Stop caring about identify and just enjoy life.

The only song I like by them so far is Fifty-Fifty Clown. What other songs would you recommend someone who likes that one?

Cannot call myself a fan, but i've (re)discovered the music recently and i enjoy it, especially the earlier albums. Love the dreamy melodies and vague vocals

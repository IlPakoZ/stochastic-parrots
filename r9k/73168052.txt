Did you hate him for some superficial reason or was he a jerk? If he was a jerk it shows she has bad judgement and will be an unreliable partner.

A snotty little prick who I almost beat the shit out of multiple times. But she just didn't it because she had zero self esteem. She's better now

Sounds like you are the problem but whatever.

>>73168345
We are happy together and I treat her good. I don't genuinely hate anybody but I very much dislike his stupid ass. Incredible condescending and rude.

>>73168345
Sounds like you suck dudes from behind

>>73168345
But yes you're right I am the problem and my problem is that I am upset she used to date someone I hate

On the flip side of this my wife had a one night stand with a really good friend of mine before she and I met.

I'd feel uneased about that but it's a lot better

Well, did she break up with him or did he break up with her?
--- 73169458
>>73169350
Broke up with him. She actually had a thing for me for quite a long time. While they were dated I confessed and she turned me down out of loyalty. But later she left him for me. I know that sounds bad when it's said but she's a good person. She just didn't know what it was like to really be loved.

>>73169458
You're a piece of shit and you don't love her it's obvious you took advantage of her during a bad time now You're making excuses while you're going to be the one slurping her exs cum out of her kek

Dude, stop grooming mentally vulnerable women. She's probably better off with that other guy, he goes to church and has a job. What do you have Daniel?
--- 73170185
>>73169502
I didn't but go ahead and assume that. I was her first bf that didn't treat her badly. Can't use that on me anyway I was her first. Literally felt the hymen break

Where did that come from? God I swear this website hosts the most spectacularly retarded people on the internet. Just because you've been hurt by OPs in the past doesn't mean I'm the enemy anon

Let him fuck you in the butt. It sounds weird, I know, but somehow it works everything out. I've done it dozens of times.

I'm sorry, anon. I don't think there are any drugs that can regrow your limbs. Maybe you can try makeup remover to get rid of that green scribble on your face. They sell it at the drug store.

Drugs have never fixed anything for anyone. Every drug is toxic

I see more and more people posting with bodies like this. 

I don't think we're fixable. I think we're dammed by environmental toxins and it's going to continue getting worse and more men will be deformed like this.

ok listen to me and not the incels, you need ketamine and shrooms. If you want to push it a few dose of mdma, especially if you're suffering of ptsd.

This is pretty good but I will recommend only very slowly building up the dosage, e.g. 1/4th of what's considered a "normal" dose at first, then 1/2, then 3/4 if necessary, with 2 weeks in between each time.

do this >>73182577
eat better. ween off of sugar and other "bad" foods. downsize your portions. slow and steady > sudden and drastic change. you can buy simple fruit and veggies at literally any grocery store, and they're cheaper (usually) than processed and completed products. start cooking for yourself, and start simple. if that's too much for you, get the fuck over it and learn. you'll be much better off in literally 6 months time.
commit to integrating basic exercise into your life. i mean BASIC; make moving your body a regular part of your daily fucking life. we both know you probably won't commit to a proper workout plan, but that's whatever. just get some fucking cardio in somehow. dance a lot. walk a lot. strap a fucking rucksack on your back and hike a mountain every week. something. anything. just don't lament about how shitty you feel. 
if you seriously make me want to eat my fucking words and want an actual workout plan, go bother >>>/fit/

very good take. I should add that the other advises itt (the non-suicidal one, aka diet and such) makes sense too.

Delusional. This is truly a case of awful genetics, its in his dna. This poor fucker could be coached by zyZz himself and make zero gains. You get nothing by lying to people, there is no future for him and im amazed he still alive

Bullshit, for all we know he has done close to nothing to cultivate a healthy way to use his body. With a fitting system of martial art he could have strong and flexible joints, a good posture, and a good muscle distribution that lasts for years or decades. "Gains" are not a traditional martial arts concept anyway.
And it has no bearing on whether ~yearly use of entheogens or psychedelics could be of aid to him in improving his thought patterns and in the gaining of new emotional insight. Obviously meditation is more effective but it's better to first get basic health right, and a mild psychedelic approach with appropriate reading (e.g. Erowid tripsitter guides) it's safer than naive engagement with the field of pharmaceutical drugs.
Asshole doomer with nothing of value to contribute.

Find a good church and pray. Pray for strength. Pray with sacrifice and fasting. If you don't like a church, go to another. It's literally free. People meme about finding God, but it gets you through the week in the very least. At its best, it gives you the power to carry your own neuroticism and everyone you love. Open your mind and let Christ in.

That Cathotlics believe God is gender neutral.
Which makes the most sense...

They should try looking at it when they find it and see if it is a boy or a girl instead of coming up with these "beliefs" about what they should know by lookingnwhe they find it!

being "stoic" as a male has always been a thing. i'd say that todays men are much more emotional than their fathers, yet todays men have much more problems forming any kind of platonic or romantic relationships that previous generations. so i doubt "not showing emotions" is the cause of men's issues today

Exactly, ironically women are the biggest enforcers of 'toxic masculinity' through mate selection. If you constantly get told by women that being really nice and empathetic will get oyu the girl, and your life experiences don't match this, eventually you'll start acting in a way that leads to more romantic success.

Toxic masculinity is when man is a MAN and not an emotional tampon.

Why are you bothering incels about this. Nobody here has a girlfriend. Go to normies.com and tell men there, oh and women will tell you they like doing it for chad.

>The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) #239 states, in reference to the Father: "God transcends the human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: He is God." The CCC discusses the traditional imagery and language of God as Father.

All means nothing compared to the final doctrine.

Lurk more, means you keep begging and hope a newfag that joined a few months before you takes pity, and spoonfeeds you.
Happened to me.

You didn't need the rest. Magic goo-gaws decided by a council of volunteer virgins wearing dresses and pointy hats are nothing. Lower than nothing, it's total gibberish plucked out of thin air. You'd be better off listening to the wind blow.

They're basically even saying they know nothing. How can a human being expect to comprehend God? The terminology of "God the Father" was written by humans, so it's completely meaningless.

> go to church and pray
> pray for xyz
Go read Matthew 6:5 - 8. Specifically, you should NOT pray in public because that's what the hypocrites do. Moreover, you should NOT ask God for things like "strength" in a prayer because he already knows what you need.

"5 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."

Uhmm... because they're straight... hence they wouldn't be interested in intimated relationships with other men... Wtf is this article?

>Kelly's boyfriend refused to talk to other men
Because other men are absolute garbage when it comes to that, so I don't blame him.

I guarantee you that if he tried to go to other men for emotional needs, he would've walked away in a worse state.

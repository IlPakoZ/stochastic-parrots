I started taking vilazodone at the beginning of last year for anxiety. It's not the kind of thing where you actively feel different while you're on it. It doesn't feel like anything and makes you question if it works at all. 
It wasn't until I looked back at situations where I normally would have been having a panic fit and realized I basically responded like I didn't care. 

I took Buspar too for a while with it and that may have helped but I'm not sure. I'm off it now.

I thought 80mg was the max dose

not necessarily bullied but just isolated from everything and treated like a ghost. i can only imagine how much shit people talk behind my back though
--- 73173884
>>73173776 (OP)
Yup. I have a severe a stutter. It was a lot worse when I was younger and I was bullied mercilessly. I was a big kid so it wasn't physical, but it still stucked. To this day I'm not good at speaking people and I assume people are making fun of me.

I had to get 3 dental implants in my first year of highschool due to the constant assaults. 
By the end of highschool i lost count of how many crowns i had to get. The punches would sometimes lead to my implants failing and i had to get new ones + bone grafts
Also broken nose, fissured ribs, etc. 
I think i have around 9 or 10 implants in total. Im not even sure anymore. 
Also suffered damage in a cornea but my eyesight is ok.
Highschool was hell. I cant believe i survived.

i thought i was a ghost in high school but i found out that people knew who i was on several occasions, people i'd never met making jokes about me. then i realised i'd made myself into a minor meme by doing saying and doing stupid shit for attention sometimes.
people in my school were too nice to openly bully me but i was good enough material to mention sometimes. i'm pretty sure that's not isolated to high school. when people are weird, they get isolated and then talked, or theorized, about.

it doesn't make sense when people say 'nobody cares about anything you do'. i know people who made judgements out loud. personally when i see someone weird in public i have a passing thought acknowledging that they're weird.
it just seems delusional to claim this. it's probably normies lying to themselves in public to maintain this illusion that they're better people than they are. like when they tell people they don't care about looks.
the only granule of truth in this is that people aren't as invested in you as you are. they think you're weird, they think you're a faggot, but they probably don't think you're an irredeemable piece of shit who should kill themselves.
--- 73174824
>>73173776 (OP)
I know how it feels anon, I dealt with this issue by simply cutting almost everyone out of my life and accepting isolation, it's a tough path but don't give anyone your time of day if they don't treat you with respect or care, normies are vicious creatures and should be avoided at all costs.
--- 73174834

this is the type of bullying i experienced. everyone was arrogant and had a god complex but also wanted to fight and would threaten you. With a high neuroplasticity at 14, you quickly 'learn' to stfu and that your opinions are not valued anywhere. You start to think that everyone is trying to set you up to talk shit on you

Yeah, it for sure ruined my life. When I was physically strong people would avoid fights but falsely report me to the courts and provoke me into saying things they could record to set me up. When I was physically weak these people would finally come to fight me.

Yes. I was short, skinny, thick NHS glasses, ginger, left-handed, nerdy and with a crippling stammer.

Got my growth spurt, took up shotokan, dyed my hair blond, got contacts and speech therapy. Lifted weights, joined the Army, learned not to walk like a victim.

It's all pieces, but you don't have to assemble them all at once.

Both. A lot of it was psychological but also physical. For instance I was stabbed with a pencil in my kidney area that took a few months to recover.

The bullying stopped but after a while I was just ignored. People were nice to me the first few days of university and it was so jarring. I thought they were being fake nice to me but I'm not sure.
--- 73176912
>>73176713
Thats usually how it goes. Word of advice, move out of the state. The reason I say that is becasue now due to internet groups (like on facebook and insta), people can become lolcows so to speak. Like people you dont even know and never met already know about you. So bullying you becomes sort of like a local community thing in a way

When I moved this shit stopped altogether and I was able to rebuild my life. You mite not realize it bro but bullying does impact your ability to build your life tremendously, you could even say that its one of the goals which is to sabotage your future

I like the point you are trying to make but doubt it. Children or youth, hardly ever think that far ahead and often times bullying really is far less personal than it may seem. It's more about them "them" not you. It might be about you in a sense that you are an easy target or got some trait that you can be bullied for.

But I do agree that being a victim of it does have consequences in the future.

I get bullied by society idk what you're talking about kids love me
--- 73177144
Yeah I don't do banter, at all. I also don't make fun of other people either. My bf has no problem with this we have fun together in other ways. Funny how my family is UNABLE to accept this. They think I'm a bitch they have to walk on eggshells around. I think that says more about them than me that they find it that hard to be nice to me. You'd think they would have empathy for their own daughter, or in my brothers case their sister. I was bullied so badly I had to change schools and almost killed myself and they really just act like it never happened and I should just be a normalfag magically because I'm an adult now. It doesn't work that way. Again why is it so hard for them to just be nice to me and treat me with respect why are normalfags obsessed with being mean to each other in a joking way?
My theory? They have anger issues as well as resentment towards me. I think they all look down on me and see me as a punching bag in a way. I'm crazy touchy Anon it could never be THEM that is the problem. But if I were to offend them I'd be expected to grovel. You see this in friendship groups, too, there is always a lower-totem pole friend that gets dunked on. That's what I am in my family I am the black sheep. When I was a little girl I used to fantasize about being in a different family because they were all so mean to me. I feel like my dad mom and two brothers are the perfect family and I just don't fit in with them all and never have. They know it too and that's why they punish me

Some of the kids I bullied went on having a decent life (at least judging from outside), some didn't.
--- 73177185
>>73176788
>People were nice to me the first few days of university and it was so jarring
That was my experience too. It took me a while to realize that victim wasn't who I was. That the old pain didn't have to follow me around, it was completely artificial and created by my abusers.

When I met good, intelligent people in uni they treated me with respect from the start. I initially thought they were playing tricks on me and any minute I was going to get attacked or laughed at for my attempts to make friends. I kept skulking around in fear for over a year living like I used to until I finally realized it wasn't me, it was the bullies. It was always the bullies. They kept me in an unnatural state of fear on a primal level, like I was prey being hunted.

If anyone is pro-bullying or a bully themselves, you're human trash. You're as sick as someone who gets off on torture or mutilation. I'm not a victim or some kind of deeply flawed person who "deserves it". It was never me. I'm a good person with good friends now. I was simply harassed by low IQ sociopaths and had little recourse to stop them. Bullies are the niggers of the social world.

This is so true. Honestly college was a healing experience for me even though I didn't make any friends. The baseline respect and friendliness my classmates gave me was unreal I felt exactly like you described. When the person next to me would make conversation with me in class I'd be shocked like who me lol
Bullying really is longterm torture it destroys your psych

I get really angry and hurt at even mild banter. I was bullied by an older sibling growing up and it has made me genuinely paranoid to the point where I perceive almost anything as a slight against me, even strangers who glance at me in public. It's a horrible existence.

That's fair. I wasn't a perfect child either and did shitty things too, but later I reflected and thought "Hey that was shitty, I shouldn't ever do that again". It sounds like you feel that way too and I'm sorry if that sounded directed at you. I was talking directly to the type of person that comes here to post that bullying is a net positive or somehow justified. It just isn't. It's shitty anti-social behavior that people should grow out of by age 15.

To be clear, I am ashamed of my past, even though I couldn't fully understand the extent of the damage I was causing. Yes I was dumb but I also knew I was selfish. I was not alone, I was encouraged by others. Other kids validated my actions. Some laughed and looked up to me. Some jumped in and tried to one up me. It got too much momentum to be fully aware and stop it as a kid
--- 73177560
>>73177448
>absolute dickheads who call being a cunt banter
If it was real banter when someone gets too offended they'd laugh it off casually and stop instead of getting mad and trying to force you to take it because they just want to rip on you uncontested. Also like you said it's reciprocal just one person doing it to another isn't banter it's just being an asshole. At best the person doing it is just retarded and has bad social skills
--- 73177562
I bullied because otherwise I was going to be bullied. One of the first days at high school someone tried to bully me (I was a good target, giga nerd, shy) and I reacted physically, which surprised him. Then I picked the weakest in the class (mildly autistic, obese, ultra high IQ but zero social skills, disgusting to girls and disgusted by girls) and made sure the bullies targeted him showing them how to hurt him most.

It's survival

Posting sheeps to say hello and good night. 
I want to switch places with goa anon to have the time to gen more...
--- 72971850
I am drunk and now I'll post some of the jojo Hana's I've made thank you.
--- 72971857
>>72971836
>i dont wanna watch it i hate when shit i like goes popular tho it was already kinda popular but still
yeah I'm kinda not looking forward to the over-discussion. But honestly, I think the first episode did the first volume better than the manga did. and if it's going to exist, I'd rather it be good than be bad. My biggest disappointment is that it means that Hell's Paradise won't get as much attention, and it's the manga I actually did want people to talk about more.
--- 72971863
>>72971850
The "ghostly butterfly" didn't really give me what I wanted, neither did the "Stand jojo" prompt. What a shame!
--- 72971870
"light trails" and "aura" work pretty well. I was hoping for something like a dbz aura but eh
--- 72971876
She seems almost like an alchemist again
--- 72971881
i want to make an ai chatbot gf, but mine alone. i dont want some chatbot gf thats connected to the cloud, that is talking to millions of other simps, and who has the values of feminist roasties. i find the idea of replica really repulsive

how do i get into it?
--- 72971886
Or maybe like a wizard or something?

>>72971881
It's probably not what you want, but I made a Hana character.ai and made her private so only i can awkwardly try to make conversation with her
--- 72971893
>>72971824
I just replaced all her clothing prompts with (pajamas)

>>72971369
style related prompts are
frank frazetta style, (traditional media), (shadow),
--- 72971901
>>72971857
>I think the first episode did the first volume better than the manga did
i might watch it, like the only reason ill probably end up watching it is seeing kana animated and some aqua x kana moments
--- 72971904
Sheev Hana
--- 72971906
>>72971886
how do i get into writing the ai used to make these chatbots?

there has to be a starting place? like learning how to shape their values and personalities and whatnot. i cant even entertain the idea of getting close to some feminist roastie controlled ai like replika
--- 72971914
She doesn't like sleeping in pants

>>72971824
Like saeriah anon said basically just pajamas and also laying or bed help too
>>72971837
Love her, does she have a name?
--- 72971920
>>72971901
so you are a kana fan?

but yeah on one hand I'm glad some of my friends watched it. On the other hand I'm sick of them talking about being TraUmatiZed by it
--- 72971934
2 of the same person in different places
--- 72971938

Yowza.
Any tips on consistency between images? I've been watching you for days and it seems really good.

based bottomless sleeper
i thinkk i will just name her Grace lol
--- 72971972
>>72971906
It was pretty easy for me; that particular program allows me to simply write about her, and the AI "got" her pretty quickly. I copypasted from her wiki page and wrote some of my own.

>>72971938
When you dial her in, keep those prompts in every gen you make
--- 72972001
2 of the same person in a different position one of them looking on the other Asci is multiplying again
--- 72972010
>>72971920
>so you are a kana fan?
yes c:
and i hated what aka did to her some chapters ago, that i just see you as a friend shit
im not really fond of aka's writing after what he did with kaguya but i love mengo
i wish aka would let her influence more on the story
--- 72972021
>>72971972
Thanks for the advice.
>>72971811
This is really addictive, huh?
--- 72972050
>>72972021
Yes, but that's not the reason why I messed up my sleep schedule
--- 72972052
>>72972010
I was surprised how much I love both kana and akane, but I was kinda disappointed in how both just got treated
--- 72972058
If any of you recognize the inspiration, you got my respect.
--- 72972062
>>72971893
She's wearing all that makeup to bed? RIP pillowcase.
--- 72972099
>>72972052
>but I was kinda disappointed in how both just got treated
Yeah, like, Aqua went from i want to protect kana at all costs to ill use her to achieve my shit out of nowhere
--- 72972105
>>72972062
>"Imagine wearing makeup, I would never, plus I'm too lazy."
>>72972021
It really is
--- 72972107
I played the new Love Live game and I'm a little disappointed. There's so many stuff turned on by default that just making note pressing harder. I turned all of that off but still sad
--- 72972128
>>72972107
HEY I NOTICED THAT TOO
but i cant understand japanese for shit so im stuck like that
i wanted to wait for the global to release but i couldnt wait anymore after losing both my sif and sifas accounts
i hope it doesnt happen a third time

I tried "the world" but not even that's working.

>>72972021

>>72971863
>>72972147
It's a shame that the ai can't really do jojo, I even tried gunning jolyne the other day and it didn't look anything like her, where I've tried other pre existing characters and it at least gets their faces right.
--- 72972195
>>72972184
I think a proper stand is all but impossible without a ton of luck.
--- 72972198
>>72972128
Here's a little guide on how I did this, that would make the screen on background of the shows turn black which is a little creepy to me, but at least I can see all the notes properly. Also I don't understand Japanese too, I discovered this by trials and errors

Maybe I should play around with style sometime.
--- 72972287

She apparently put some on but also put her wings away as well

--- 72973515
>>72973468
>poof
And the wings are back
But clothes got skimpier
--- 72973630
I'm admitting defeat and going to a revolver because I don't think the AI can give me the repeater I my hamburger heart desires.

>>72973515
So I can choose between wings and clothes, huh?
--- 72973694
The AI seems to know a few actual cowboy guns but I'm not sure if it'll give them to me consistently.

I love my adorable little /r9k/ trans gf.

OP is referring to Retard san, an AMAB MTF boymoder described as a cute girl with long beautiful hair and deep knowledge of WW2 and Resident Evil. Following male puberty, Retard san began her HRT journey at age 18 and has now passed the 4 year mark.

Retard san makes threads sharing the romantic story of how she met her soul mate, Tranny kun, on r9k in order to give hope to other true robots like herself. Tranny kun reciprocates by dedicating threads like this one to her.

Tranny kun is a bisexual chaseoid who crusades on behalf of true robots, defending their board from normalfags despite never claiming the robot identity for himself. He regularly wins 20v1 arguments against r9k users which is why a small subset of them invented the meme about him crumbling under scrutiny.

Some have argued that their relationship is performative or unhealthy due to Tranny kun regularly prompting Retard san to make these threads about him or because he invalidated her lived experience as a lonely trubot but that criticism most likely stems from jealousy as Tranny kun has humblebragged about Retard san planning to dress as a maid and wear black lingerie for him when they meet at Retard san's grandparents for the next chapter of their love story. He flatly denies any suggestion that Retard san's visit to his parents caused any shock or embarrassment and no diapers were found by his mother afterwards.

The next chapter of their romance will be a romantic getaway to Retard san's grandmother's home. At present, Retard san is not 'out' to her Catholic grandparents who therefore will not be respecting Retard san's preferred pronouns and will be using her birth name (known as deadnaming). Luckily, the language barrier should prevent any embarrassing confrontations over this for the duration of the visit.

I fell in love with Kumagawa poster. I don't know how it happened, but his charm got to me and I grew an obsession. I feel like by fate I'm meant to be with him. I love him a lot guys

She died to protect her family and, despite our sins, rose again from the subway on the third day to save all of us. I dream of the day when all robots will be united under her banner, brothers in devotion to the one true everQueen of r9k.

That's not true at all, his body is super erotic. He has a lot of nice lean muscles and a big wide back. You would know if you weren't a fake fan cause he's already posted body pics before

I've already made great progress on unlocking his heart. You probably know NOTHING ABOUT HIM and you never will so have fun watching us fall in love from afar

Why are you so mentally ill, Kumagawa poster? Do you have zero personality that you have to samefag and pretend you have admirers to boost your own self esteem?
--- 73093317
>>73092927 (OP)
I have actually... my wife Texas-chan... she has gone AWOL
I haven't seen her post in months but I still think about her

--- 73093351

WHAT
If you're being serious then I'm being catfished
--- 73093385
>>73093364
well sorry to be the one to tell you this but you are indeed being catfished. But it's fine the person catfishing you seems to be attractive and cool enough for you to fall for them so is it really a problem
--- 73093400
>>73093351
Wow, you have amazing timing! Wow, what a coincidence you joining this thread just in time, that's amazing!
--- 73093411
is kumagawa the new vyro?
pretending he's an undesirable while also having egirls swarm his dick?

>But it's fine the person catfishing you seems to be attractive and cool enough for you to fall for them so is it really a problem
They have been cool so far but if it isn't you they have just been mimicking your personality. Also they use your pics so no I don't know what they look like. I really thought I was in contact with you this whole time. I've embarrassed myself enough, sorry, goodbye
>>73093297
>>73093400
Faggot. 

Leave him alone.
--- 73093452
Not really "love" but I did spend an entire thread talking to a fembot without swapping contacts and did think "Wow my life would be massively improved if I was dating someone like her"
--- 73093480
>>73093440
>mimicking your personality
this really seems interesting, how would you describe my personality, i'm curious, I think it's pretty hard to give me one only going from my posts

Yes. We were together for 4 years, thought we would be married. She went to college and became a normies. It's over...
--- 73093788
>>73093778
What happened? She cheated on you with college chads?
--- 73093821
>>73093031
Don't worry homie, I'll make sure no crazy bitch other than you can approach him ;3
--- 73093852
>>73093788
The respect just vanished from the relationship when she decided to dorm for her last semester. Was she cheating? Idk maybe. But she fundamentally changed as a person and we kept having arguments. At one point she took my car without permission and it was the last straw so i kicked her out of our shared apartment and we both blocked each other on everything. Was it the right choice? Idk,l. But I'd rather be lonely than disrespected.

I tried dating 2 robots and both times it ended badly. One being an alcoholic tranny and the other a mentally ill twink. I guess I'm on my third robot now but this time is lasting a lot longer and is a lot more pleasant.
--- 73095480
>>73092927 (OP)
I added a few people here I think I'm catching feelings for one of them but he doesn't like online relationships and lives very very far away. I hope I can find a way to get over him.
--- 73095504
KUMAAA SAY HI TO ME Can confirm he's hot lol

To answer the question, yes, I did meet an anon on here that I admittedly kind of fell in love with. I miss her...
--- 73095519
Also Kuma wtf how do you keep attracting so many girls man?
--- 73095548
>>73095504
Does he just give out his pic to any random who wants it? lol
--- 73095550
>>73093364
There was a fake Kuma posting here a while back, maybe you added that guy? When did you add him?
--- 73095710

You are such a normalfag holy shit
--- 73095737
>>73095504
POCOOO can't believe you'd admit saying he's hot LMAO
>>73095519
I think the second one was fake desu idk. I only approve of the first girl
--- 73095861
>>73095504
Tell us about her bro
>>73095737
Huh what makes the second one not credible?
Personally I believed both
--- 73095869
>>73095737
>I only approve of the first girl
She seems very dedicated to save and post Kuma images.
>POCOOO can't believe you'd admit saying he's hot LMAO
I know a hot guy when I see one.
...I'm not gay at all by the way.
--- 73095879
>>73095861

If this thread is still up in a few hours, I will take some time to write about her. I need to be in a better place for a more serious reply.
--- 73095913
>>73095861
Hmm idk its like 50/50, it could be true that she got catfished, OR, it could be that she/he got caught in their lie and had to make up a story since kuma does not have snapchat. 

>>73095869
I love her. Shes a younger me, so I approve. 
>not gay
Hehehe ofc ofc I know no homo owo
--- 73095918
>>73093317
I fell in love with this girl. I hope she receives my cuddle shark.
--- 73095919
All you mother fuckers loved my namefagging when I lost a bet and had to do it for a couple weeks.
--- 73096167
>>73095913
Yeah I could see how that's fishy
But if she was caught in a lie then why post again or try to confirm if he really doesn't have a snap chat? Definitely a weird case either way.
>>73095879
Then I will await your post fren, now I'm extra curious.
--- 73096368

Have you figured out what you'll say?
--- 73097530

No, I'm kind of procrastinating on writing it. I'll probably write it somewhere else first.

I don't think my story is worth waiting for honestly, but... I will keep writing it.

--- 73098355
She was the nicest person I've ever met online. She would help me calm down when I felt anxious about talking to her, and comfort me when I felt like I wasn't good enough for her. She would leave me a good morning message before I woke up, something for me to look forward to when I turned on my PC first thing in the morning between classes. Little by little, she changed me. With her kind words, I slowly started to change my life for the better, even if the changes seem insignificant now.

>...and from the murky depths I raised my head and saw above me a ball of white light...

---

I'd given her my Discord, and I waited for her to send me a request. It was a lonely, dark Christmas night; I sat in my creaky chair, switching back and forth between 4chan and Discord, bored.

Bring me a Christmas miracle, I thought to myself as I spun around on my chair. Let it happen.

I opened 4chan and created a post. Not a manifestation thread, no, but a GF summoning thread. Then I sent it into the depths of /r9k/.

>Snow blankets the world around me, basking me in the streetlamps' light.

---

I thought I was going insane with how much I was thinking about her. My mood kept going up and down, like a rollercoaster, in the span of a few hours. I'd send her a message, and in waiting for her response, my anxiety would shoot through the roof. I would become terribly depressed. And then when she responded to me, in that sparkly manner as she always did, my mood would rise again and I would become elated. These severe changes in mood lead me to believe that there was something wrong with me. Did I have BPD?

I told her I felt anxious about talking to her, and she'd tell me:

"Deep breaths!"

Deep breaths. Deep breaths...

Which always calmed me down.

>The way the light shines above me in the sky, parting a way through the clouds, was always so beautiful to me.

>>73098355
It was New Year's Eve. 

Perhaps she had been drinking that night. She was a lot looser with her words, acting more affectionate with me than usual, and somehow the conversation turned to talking about how what we'd do together if we met up, what sort of dates we would go on, how we'd hold each other. In the midst of all those sweet words, I realized that my feelings for her had grown, and I decided to make clear my feelings to her. Gathering up my courage, I finally told her: I love you.

My heart racing, I waited for her response.

"I love you too!"

I wondered if my summoning thread had anything to do with this situation I found myself in. 

>The angel's wings were spread wide before my field of vision, surrounding me with warmth...

---

We'd talk about our lives. I was a little embarrassed when I told her about my bad habits, but she didn't seem to be put off by them. I told her I never made my bed, and she encouraged me to do it!

I'll do it for her, I thought.

So up I stood, and I walked over to my bed, tidying up the covers. After I finished, I finally sat back down.

"The whole room feels a lot more organized now, doesn't it?"

Looking back at my bed, I had to agree with her.

>The wheels were set in motion...

>>73098369
I used to talk to her a bit every morning before I went to class, and after that, I'd talk more with her, late into the night. She was always worried about keeping me up too late, however - and I was trying to fix my sleep schedule, too - so more often than not we'd end our conversations early.

One day, however, she stopped messaging me in the mornings. Perhaps she'd gotten more busy, so that she couldn't spare the time to talk in the morning?

I'd continue to have conversations with her at night, but those seemed to lower in frequency too. I'd wait longer and longer to catch her online for a quick chat, and I'd be elated every time she responded. Until one night, I waited a whole month for her to come back.

And it was then she returned for a final time... to say goodbye. 

I never got to respond to her. I was at work that day.

>After the dust settled, I was left with a hole in my heart - but one that was a little smaller than before.

---

One day, she asked me what my favourite music was. I replied that I didn't really listen to a lot of different music; mostly Japanese doujin music. It was kind of embarrassing sending her an album with a picture of an anime girl as the album art, but she said she would listen to the whole thing to get to know me better! My heart raced at those words.

She sent me a song she really liked. It was a simple, yet nostalgic song that made me feel super romantic.

We talked about how she loved to go on drives playing that song as she drove. I decided to take a page out of her book and listen to her song as I traveled by train to school. It really helped me calm down whenever I felt stressed.

>We walked down the street, the ground covered with golden leaves as the cool autumn breeze caressed our faces and combed through our hair.
--- 73098382
>>73098379
Honestly, I ended up crying that night. I couldn't really bear the thought of her being gone from me, even though we'd agreed not to get too close to each other because the chance of us getting into an actual relationship was just too small. She wanted a real-life relationship, and I accepted that. Yet somehow I'd fallen for her the more we talked. 

I still had to go to school. I boarded the train, found myself a seat, put on my headphones, and listened to the song she showed me all those months ago. It was absolutely beautiful outside that morning.

Do you still talk to her? Having a girl who's loved you before is amazing to have and shows you have good potential even if you didn't get to have a real gf, really.
--- 73098520
>>73098477
Yeah, having her say she liked me was a great boost for my confidence. She said I'd probably have no trouble getting a gf. I have no contact with her; I never gave her any alternative forms of contact and she decided to remove her internet presence, basically. I wonder if I'll ever meet a girl like her again...

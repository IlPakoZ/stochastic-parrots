Yes next time ask her out, get her number, never take no for an answer, and be very aggressive if you get declined initially, shes just playing hard to get

Nope, they are just doing their job or are just being friendly.
A woman would have to touch me a lot and almost molest me in order to show me that they actually wanted me.

I would eat everything in that picture.

That's a bit much, but they definitely have to initiate at least three interactions before I think they actually are trying to spend time with me.

lol, this
This is why I'd rather wait for physical contact. Though I know that will never happen. Talk is cheap, especially in that line of work. Same with looking/staring. It means nothing without talking and touching. They hate (non-Chad) guys hitting on them anyway. Women are the choosers; and at almost 37 (and a bald manlet who is too aspie to escape NEETdom) I know they won't choose me. I have gotten into some small talk with a couple of bar-maids, as well as a few women at a coffee shop (that recently closed down, shit!). It's nice, but I know it means nothing. I am planning no weddings, lmao.

What are you doing here on a Saturday evening/night? Wouldn't it be better if we were outside with friends/gf?

no, after 25 it doesnt matter you're meant to marry the gf you've been dating since 19 at that stage. if you missed out on 18-25 you missed out on life and its pointless to pretend otherwise by trying after that.

sure.
i legitimately have no clue what 5 years out looks like.
There was always the possibility of war but 
I didn't think this kind of AI would come about for another decade at least

AI will plateau in usefulness and advancement just like every other technology. This newest shiny toy will fade away with time into another mere fad, after which we will sit again in dumb helplessness awaiting the next true scientific miracle. I pray it arrives soon.

Yes. Once I understood the true ramifications of AI, I decided to not even attempt to live within the confines of societal expectations. I'm ready to die at any point, I drink and smoke constantly and I'm extremely jaded. Knowledge is a burden, ignorance is bliss. I wish I had no idea what AI actually is.

Yeah, I'm really looking forward to robotics taking off and having an ai driven companion. While some run from the baslisk, others aim to fuck it.

I'm a luddite at this point. I don't understand it and I'll live apart from it because I have no interest.

Can I just get a bachelor's and master's degree in linguistics at age like 28? I have a BS in computer science and have a CS job but I find it boring and by contrast it makes me feel really warm and fascinated and happy to think about about language

that's great anon, doing both shouldn't be an issue. I do recommend saving up money so that you don't have to pick up any debt, try and reach out to your local university, the BS in CS should be enough to do a masters in linguistics, might have to take a few prereqs but no need to get another bachelor in most cases

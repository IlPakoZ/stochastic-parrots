Doesn't matter one bit. There's still an objectively far more attractive one out of the lot. They will be the center of attention, and most definitely the standout.

>>73149681
>Elaborate. 
Say you're good looking and benefit from the halo effect your entire life, especially when it comes to dating. This inevitably gives you a healthy ego and self esteem. Some incel comes up to you and points out that if you weren't good looking you'd have a much harder time in life, and especially with girls. Why would you accept his theory, even if it's probably true? You would be less happy for no tangible benefit (at least if you don't care about understanding things more 'truthfully'). 

Basically good looking people live on ezmode, and part of that is benefiting from just world fallacy, in which they are the just people who benefit from their own righteousness. They live in a blissfully ignorant paradise, and you're asking them to step out of it simply to have a perspective closer to the truth.

There's a difference between implicitly knowing and explicitly knowing something. An implicit, painful truth is much easier to suppress to avoid mental pain than an explicitly stated truth. By not agreeing with something obviously true, even if it's explicitly stating, they maintain plausible deniability to themselves and keep that painful truth and mental pain in the realm of the implicit. Basically their goal is to feel good and avoid pain, so they act accordingly
--- 73149812
>>73149433 (OP)
I'll give you the real answer that nobody else has given you. They need to believe that they earned everything in life. That everything good in their lives has come about from their own hardwork and doing. For them to accept that it was only their attractiveness that is the reason everything in their life is great, would be to tear down their reality. It also means that a significant portion of those they dated, are friends with, etc. weren't because of them the person, but only because of their looks. They'd have to live the rest of the lives wondering why the other person likes them, why they got the job, etc. They'd rather go full on into their current reality instead of tearing it down and living that life.

How can white privilege exist if whites aren't the richest group? If they have very little power? If they are the global minority? If they get passed over just for being white?

Yes, I'm sure those that grew up during the economic boom in Japan sure was shit. I'm sure being able to leave all your expensive out in the open and return to find it untouched is really shit.

problem i have is it could be 'unfair' in a number of different ways. 
i think theres often a lack of empathy for unattractive people that is a lot more severe. in this way it is not unfair.
you could say it is unfair to the attractive person as they can't claim hardship like they ugly people do for seemingly the same task, but imagine how dumb it would be to trade your attractiveness to be able to whine with others. they wouldn't do it because its not a very important thing to have. they tradeoff is worth it.
i guess my conclusion is that its not unfair. its just a minor psychological dilemma that attractive people may face.

For men physical appearance has no advantages and there is no reason to claim falsehoods. For women it's everything, and they don't admit it because it would create a ton of competition. Better to be a 7/10 among 5/10s than a 10/10 among other 10/10s.

i'm not so sure that I am very different. i've been on here for roughly a decade. incel wasn't even a word people used when i first came here. 
to be honest i used to be a huge crybaby here and just whine about women and normies. i'm 30 years old now and are not as viscerally concerned about those things because i barely care about women, i am now more skilled with dealing with normal people, and generally my world view has become more developed. 

most people here are in their 20s. theres a lot of party culture, hooking up and stuff in early 20s and then most those party goers naturally start to fall into their long term relationships and places in society. people here struggle to take part in this so they ruminate over it. its fuel on the fire if you can notice people in every day life notice that somethings off about you.
>what do you think about women and dating, way too much stock
unfortunately some of these people take these feelings into their 30s. i am fortunate in this way that I stopped caring as much. i think theres a lot of truth in black pill stuff, but women are very confusing and there's kind of a weird observability problem when it comes to understanding them, so i wouldnt assume black pillers know best. 
despite this, because women are such a pain in the ass and long term relatiionships are so volatile with them, i've successfully diverted my efforts to other things. i think that answered your question, not sure though.

What do you mean by "best"? I agree that not everything they say is accurate, but I do believe they know better than everyone for the most part making them the best. You seem pragmatic so if you see how they aren't, please explain. I feel that you would be fair in your opinion.

They don't admit it because then it invalidates more or less all of their life achievements outside of academia, which even that is down to genes. 

They cling to it because people are fundamentally driven by ego and emotion and attractive people grew up in a very specific sphere. They were endlessly praised, validated and given company, and basically inculcated in cognitive dissonance.
>you succeeded because you're special and deserved it! 
>you succeeded because you worked really hard and achieved it, no advantages whatsoever! 

Once that dissonance becomes apparent in adolescence, it's too difficult to shake. It gets even harder when they inevitably meet at least one genetic low value person with stronger charisma or who actually struggled to achieve more. Success is fundamentally a part of who they are as a person, but that very specific form of success. It needs to be both types or they don't get the validation hit they need. 

It also makes them feel like bad people. They spent their lives harassing, bullying and stepping on anyone in their way or for fun, under the mindset that it was all a level playing field and they were just playing it better. The other guy should just do what they do. Acknowledging their genetic and financial advantages changes that dynamic completely and makes them irredeemable, which they're too morally rigid and immature to grapple with or just accept.

They choose to live in their Halo Effect bubble because leaving it would be a nightmare for them.

they are more willing to explore/touch topics no one else would dare touch or even think about, which is valuable. their interpretations are also worth considering, but it does not mean their interpretations are always right. the situations and things they are examining are still black boxes with a lot going on inside. if i dont completely understand something, i'm not going to rely on one way of looking at it to make decisions in varying/nuanced situations.
>there's kind of a weird observability
yeah i'm not too sure how to explain this. i guess i just have a harder time understanding women. this isn't just in romance, but like working with them, communicating with them, making sure they don't dislike dealing with me, etc. i can make guesses as to why, but usually ends with me making large generalizations that i'm skeptical of.

>i'm not going to rely on one way of looking at it to make decisions in varying/nuanced situations.
I don't understand what decisions are they making that you believe are unwise? The conclusion I drew from it after my experiences matching a lot of their observations was women weren't worth my time. I will nearly always be disadvantaged heavily when interacting with them so it's best to focus my efforts on other things. Family, friends and hobbies. Also, that my lack of success in dating women/any relationships is not a reflection of my character being poor. Basically freeing me in a sense from allowing failure to harm my self esteem.

>>73149433 (OP)
Because to do so would be to admit that much of the success in their lives can be put down to random chance. That the biggest reason for their success is something that was already done before they were even born.
They don't want to admit that, they want to believe that they're as successful as they are because they put in the effort, that it was their actions that rewarded them. And likewise, they want to believe that the people that aren't successful are failures because they're lazy and didn't put in the effort, rather than because those people just failed the random dice roll that they succeeded.

It's like how boomers always say that they're well-off because "they put in the effort" when they were younger, and that "kids these days are just lazy". As opposed to admitting that they're just well-off because they were born at the exact right time, when practically anyone could be financially well-off.

Think about the reverse for a second OP. If you have an advantage from anything what point does it serve to let people know you have that advantage?

In a game of poker does it make sense to let others know you have a good hand so everyone folds and you get the bare minimum ante? Or do you use your advantage to the fullest to maximize your gains and convince people that you don't have said advantage?

Whether you like it or not life itself is a game where all of the players are constantly trying to leverage whatever advantages they have against others. You don't gain anything by bringing those advantages to light otherwise people would take that into account when dealing with you.

>life achievements outside of academia, which even that is down to genes.
Yeah. I wish more people realized this. Academic success is for the most part a function of how people treat you, which in turn is a function of how good looking you are.
A good looking guy enjoys going to class, because everyone there enjoys being around him and respects him (because he's good looking) including the teacher. He doesn't need to spend any mental effort concentrating because he has no worries in the back of his mind undermining his concentration; and the teacher loves how good looking he is so she will give him great grades even when the quality of his work is subpar. He's where he belongs, and enjoys being there.
On the other hand an ugly guy can't focus, having been the target of violence multiple times; he feels unsafe and constantly has tunnel vision, needs to watch over his shoulder, knows the teacher won't defend him (because he's ugly and therefore his life doesn't matter) and so on. He must spend the entirety of his mental energy focusing on how to survive and making it to the end of the day in a violent environment where he must fight to stay alive every day. That was my highschool experience- I had to get multiple dental implants in my first year and was even knocked unconscious once.

Looks = social success = academic and financial success

Nah, it's about how naturally smart you are. I knew dudes who weren't handsome, fucked around and got great grades because school was piss easy for them.

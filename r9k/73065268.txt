how true is this, fellow robots?

No quit being retarded and fuck off with Twitter screenshots that's just bait
--- 73065276
>>73065268 (OP)
Not true for robots. Possibly true for chads.
--- 73065284
As a human resource officer, I would say: not at all.
--- 73065297
>>73065268 (OP)
in my experience it's actually very true
they want you to still be nice to them in spite of their being mean and they also don't like that you make them vulnerable

>>73065268 (OP)
Pick mes do.
--- 73065316
>>73065268 (OP)
>make me
>fight me
These are pretty typical words of a teasing girl who likes you
>the other ones
depends on the context
--- 73065323
Feels or not, why in hell would I stay around to listen to insults?
--- 73065343
"Fight me" is a definite on that list. No girl who hates a guy wants anything except for him to get away submissively from her as quickly as possible and without any consequences to her afterward
--- 73065354
I hate existing in a world with other men.
--- 73065359
>>73065323
See, people on this board take EVERYTHING waaaay too seriously because of insecurity and years of feeling rejected by everyone. 
Those insults are playful, people, both men and women dont mean them. Its fun to tease and joke around but its true that people who dont feel comfortable while interacting with others will have a hard time understanding cues.
--- 73065368
>playful,tease, joke around
Not interested, those people can fuck right off.
--- 73065380
>>73065268 (OP)
no woman over the age 25 talks like this and if they do they should be avoided
--- 73065391
>>73065268 (OP)
If she's Asian, maybe.
--- 73065397
>>73065368
Why? Do you want to stay uptight and serious the whole time? Doesnt it get draining not to mess around sometimes while you are (probably) still relatively young?
--- 73065399
>>73065380
I just recently got out of a relationship with a 28y/o who was like this. But she was kind of crazy.
--- 73065400
>>73065316
'you're a loser' 'you're so annoying' are literally them just calling you a disappointment. maybe he thinks them ever having an expectation has something to do with him?
--- 73065407
>>73065268 (OP)

It's true if you're Chad, and DEFINITELY if you are a nigger.

Not true for anyone here though.
--- 73065425
>>73065297
Lol I had to figure this out the hard way. As an autist I literally stuck the middle finger up at a girl because she was hitting me with balloons lol.
--- 73065428
>>73065397
>Do you want to stay uptight and serious the whole time?
Yes. 
It is draining to mess around with clowns and their sort of fun is a fucking nuisance.

For someone who pretends to understand people, you are kind of a dumbass.

Whether they are playful or not depends entirely on the context. I can assure you that if a girl says "You're a loser" to me, she isn't teasing. She means it.
--- 73065456
>But we are just le playful anon!
Equivalence of hearing "He just wants to play" while seeing a 100kg pitbull rushing at you.
--- 73065473
>>73065268 (OP)
Probably true up to middle school.

Which one do you guys think is the negative one? :T you gotta be an idiot not to recognize teasing and if you believe that you got actually insulted instead, just cut her off? Plus, if you have a hard time understanding the tone or you got hurt regardless, just set boundaries?

>>73065434
Yes. I DO know that oh my fucking god, of course it doesnt ever just comes out of nowhere and/or from a stranger, you petty retard. Also stop the self pity 
>>73065428
Well, okay you do you
>>73065456
Pitbulls are cute, they look like seals when their ears are down
--- 73065620

Seeing your personality I sure hope you will always stay a stranger
--- 73065630
>>73065592
>you gotta be an idiot not to recognize teasing
I didnt understand teasing ever. Why not saying your feelings directly.
--- 73065670
>>73065620
Sure thing, to each their own 
>>73065630
Why not communicate with the girl that is interested in you that this is not something you like? Its that easy to make her stop and be more direct even if this is unusual for her. Why do you assume all the people around know what you prefer?
--- 73065747
>tfw me and this girl i talk to tease each other all the time
>if i get her to laugh really hard, she usually says "i hate you" playfully
am i in, bros?
--- 73065755
>>73065670
>Why do you assume all the people around know what you prefer?
Why assume someone else cares for your preference? 
Is it on me to grasp your foreign language when you talk with me, or is it on you to use a language I know when you want to be understood?
--- 73065768
>>73065670
>Why not communicate with the girl that is interested in you that this is not something you like?
I dont know how to communicate with girls.

where is this audio from
--- 73065880
>>73065755
You have a point, but the thing is, she will assume you speak the same language because you look like the rest people around who do. How is she supposed to know to change her language if you dont communicate back that you cant understand her? 
>>73065768
Then dont, especially if you dont care to try and change that, problem solved 
>>73065804
You tell me
--- 73065933
>>73065268 (OP)
If you're in fucking highschool. Then yes. If you're over 18 then fuck no. Aside from obviously sexual ones like 'make me'

Because he's a bitter sack of seethe who blames his bad luck and failures on women, and thus has no room in his heart to forgive them the slightest fuck-up. As soon as she treats him the same way, though, he'll be here in a holy fury, demanding to know why women's rights haven't been rolled back to avenge his pain.
--- 73065968
>>73065880
>if you dont care to try and change that
I cannot change what I do not understand.
--- 73066028
>>73065880
She is the one who decide to suddenly start communicating in in negger-nese Why was it soo tempting to type an "i" there instead?
for 'fun' instead of being understandable or honest, and claims to not notice she is simply a displaying the actions of a childish insulting cunt.
Wasnt she supposed to be the empathic gender or is my pokerface suddenly that good she doesnt notice? 
Seems much more like a purposeful slight under the guise of 'fun' to me. And sue me, that is exactly how I'll treat that shit every time.
--- 73066035

women definitely do this over 18 lol

>>73065968
You can change the fact that you dont understand it. 
>>73066028
Yeah well, now Im kinda glad she doesnt know your language.
--- 73066132
>>73066083

That is pretty mutual, dont think anything good would come out of it for either side.
--- 73066135

My girl calls me a loser and says fight me etc. I'd beat you up but I don't care because I like femdom
--- 73066905

Those people who understand (normies) dont end up here and especially do not become wizards. I didnt like teasing nor I understood it.

it's funny
--- 73067021
>>73065268 (OP)
Not really. This one girl used to tease me all the time (along with other flirty shit she'd used to do) but then when I confessed my feelings she said she didn't want to ruin our friendship.

And then went right back to doing all that flirty shit (I am NOT mistaking it for being friendly). It seems as though she wants my attention even MORE now, she's always the first to view my stories, replies to them, whenever I see her she tries to always be "in my way", etc.

Women are weird, bro.
--- 73067025

You have such a fucking cute voice holy shit anon

In womens mind the harder they are chased the more valuable they feel and the more the man proves he might be worth it. If they give you the keys to the kingdom right from the get go they assume (correctly) that you are going to pump and dump them. A no doesn't always mean no. If you treat females like a business interaction you are going to have a rough time.

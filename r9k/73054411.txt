Bros I was happy when ai hentai smut started getting produced, I was always on the edge of trying to draw but never wanted to put in the time just for some 2D smut, but the only thing it seems to do and still struggles with is generic pinups with a very limited range of styles and for some reason gigantic hyper dicks
When will ai actually get good?

You're obviously a newb at it, probably have no clue how to fine tune your model

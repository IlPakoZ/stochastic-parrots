Why do women get so mad when men say they dont want relationships/marriage?
--- 73184580
Marriage is the end game to ensure they have power over men.

i wouldn't be mad i would be depressed.
>>73184580
some guys like that.

>moid has one purpose

same reason why you'd be mad if you put bread in a toaster and it didn't heat it up

This I just broke up with my GF last night and all she wanted was a check. Piece of shit. She blocked me, and I guess unblocked me. I sent "piece of shit" and I think it got through before being blocked again.

Women don't like men who see through their bullshit.
It's also why they hate autists so much.

>man wants relationship
>"ew gross, there's no way i'd date you, you aren't 6'4" with bulging muscles and supermodel face"

>man doesn't want a relationship
>"wtf, not wanting to date women is misogynistic, it's your one purpose"

Autists dont see through women bullshit. If anything they are the easiest and most gullible prey. Prime example is Chris Chan

I don't mean the low functioning ones. They may be vulnerable to actual conscious manipulators.
It's moreso the fact that all the usual "tricks" they use on men don't work on autists.

There is also a romance part but >>73184580 is sadly right. Men are still usually the successful ones financially. Being married means she can get something later with a divorce (especially if you had kids). Just being faithful isn't interesting to most of women.

It removes women's power over men. I experienced this myself a decade ago. I told a girl I wasn't interested in relationships, so she instantly got mad and tried to insult me despite everything being fine 10 seconds earlier

>>73184918
I also noticed that they suddenly become interested more in you

I don't. I think WGTOW / MGTOW future is good.

I wouldn't know unless these pussy ass women said it in a straightforward way. It's crazy how everything is in their favor and they still pretend to be shy as if they can't get whatever they want on a silver platter any day of the week

Men feel entitled to sex. Women feel entitled to you devoting the rest of your life to them.

Alpha fucks, beta bucks.
The moment to bend to their will is the moment they lose attraction to you.

Iits.not a common thing ppl ask me but when I was asked this they just nodded in understanding or asked if I was gay.
No anger or resentment at all.

why don't you just start a general goods store with a paltry $335,000 "loan" from your father-in-law or uncle?

I am a Walmart employee and just enrolled in their 401k. They match up to 6% of your contributions. The corporate people are obsessed with Sam Walton and treat him like a god.

what's your position at the wal mart?

Order selector (warehouse). I am due for another raise soon and am probably getting promoted to one of their new trainer positions which I assume entails a raise because I'll have to interview for it and attend a class, and it's just a lot of extra responsibility. For years they didn't pay the trainers anything extra and that was really fucked up because warehouses are dangerous and it takes a lot to train someone new to safely work and perform their job in that kind of environment.

What sort of store? 335k is basically nothing these days you would waste that just getting the fridges up and running.

that was in 1945, you could buy an oil rig for $15 and a car for $3

Tens of millions of Americans have more than $400k in home equity. I could borrow almost $200k from my own 401k.

NEETs who deliberately live on public assistance and collect cans to try to buy a new laptop have a skewed conception of the ability of middle class people to accumulate minor amounts of capital. (And yeah, $20k in 1945 was capital, but it was still minor capital.) Especially when you're the personality type that is going to end up building a business empire, or the father of the girl that guy marries.

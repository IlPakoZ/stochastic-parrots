i wish i acquired anything lasting from all the time i've wasted here
yet i've got nothing to show for it
no online friendships/relationships, no hangouts, no one with similar interest
guess i'm just invisible, both irl and behind the screen
>what is your plan when picrel happens?

I move on, I guess... There are tons of other online spaces out there that I can move to

That said, there's nothing quite like 4chan.

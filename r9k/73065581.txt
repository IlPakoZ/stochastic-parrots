I was jsut standing in the shower thinking about things. I don't do it often but I started introspecting heavily for about an hour.
I suddenly realised, I have blocked out every intimate moment I've ever hard, except the negative ones. I've never had a girlfriend or something like that but I'm talkinga friends and particularly parents, even siblings. 
Unless I focus extremly hard and try to think about events in my life, not a single overwhelmingly positive human experience comes to mind. It's all negative traumatizing events. 
I don't know what it is called but atleast I realised I have completely lost my humanity. There is nothing but a husk left.

Negative experiences are more powerful than positive ones, so unless you had PTSD etc. i think you're alright

stop introspecting, its bad for you unironically 
but yeah im also a nonhuman and a husk but I've come to peace with it

then pivot anon
what you focus on and remember is, at least to some extent, your choice
nobody can change it for you
either embrace being a husk or reject it and try to climb out of the necropolis

stopping introspecting is when you really lose your humanity and become an npc

you've got it wrong, introspection is NPC behavior and leads to absolutely nothing good
stop thinking about yourself, its fucking retarded. that's the only thinking normies do, think about themselves. they might think about themselves in relation to others instead of in relation to themselves but that's just about the only thing they do. 
an empty mind is a healthy mind.

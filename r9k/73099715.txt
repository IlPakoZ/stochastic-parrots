It hate being alone like this. It would be different if I was just willing to date random people, but I just feel no urge to even try with them. I want to love someone and be loved back jesus christ

if somebody treats you like that they're not worth your love
Take some time to recover and move on

if you're gay you need to pick Flamboyant Cockslut or Monk Mode celibate homo. CHOOSE

I know but I knew this person for like a year beforehand and trusted them. Literally thought they were perfect and viewed them as angelic

I'm pretty much monk mode against my will. I hate whores and don't plan on getting into that ever. I cannot be a true monk though because I still have worldly desires and fear growing old alone

I'm gay and I accepted the monk lifestyle. Gays can't find LTR. It's not possible. Accept it and move on.

It's more likely they'll just SWAT each other to death IMO. There's already a trend towards these streamlined narcing laws going nationwide, from the initial autist control red flag laws (made in response to mass shootings) to the more recent texas abortion fracas.

Even the foreigners mocking amerisharts have no idea how bad it really is right now. In the future there will be law, but no order, since you can just sick the cops on anyone you hate for any reason. Basically not that different from any of the tinpot dictatorships we propped up in the Cold War.

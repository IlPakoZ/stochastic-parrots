ive been browsing old r9k on the archives and it makes me depressed how good this place used to be

>new pepes
>tfw threads 
>way less porn 
>everyone friendlier 
>actual conversation 
>funny memes
>comfy memes 
>just fellow losers talking about being losers 

my best memories may have been scrolling old r9k and smoking weed. and ive actually had sex. 

this culture should be sacred.

Half the posts from then were people like you complaining that /r9k/ was ruined because people made posts like that instead of doing greentext stories and calling each other gentleman like from the earlier years.
You're all faggots and should shut the fuck up. Make the threads you want to see instead of whining about it.

To be fair, there are to many normalfags on this board nowadays, and too many people we wouldn't even consider robots, even if they were khv. What being a robot was back then, was outcast spirit or ostracized spirit. Something that many people have forgotten. Sure "virginity" was important, but I think moreso, life experiences and ones nature as an outcast was even more important. It's the difference between being seen as a cringe ledditor faggot in your childhood vs being seen as the potential school shooter. Even nerds and geeks had their friend groups, robots had almost no one.

Zoomers are the ones who hate on trannies you retard.
I'm 36 and was here before you and we jerked off to trannies back in my day instead of turning into a stupid political shitfliging thing.
Here's one of my 2016 era NEET posting OC pics to match with what OP is talking about.

>>73191368
Newfags aren't that much of a problem. The problem was that old robot culture and robot mentality and robot sensibilities weren't passed onto the newfags, and so the culture is basically now lost. This is basically a lot of our own faults, being unable to transmit the ideals and "geist" of our community to the new generation.

zoomers laid waste to this place dude they have zero culture. all they care about is discord drama there is no hope for them the only thing you can do is get away from them and hope they dont invade. 

they are an inherently jewish generation completely owned by corporations they do not have souls.
--- 73191507
>>73191440
Zoomers are only that way because us robots didn't teach em shit, or at least they weren't able to see robot culture because of the large influx of non-bits on the board and therefore mistook the culture for some other thing, like incel ideology. And I thinks that's the key problem, incel ideology, an ideology that creates orbitfags, cucks, and coomers. Incel ideology and culture is absolutely obsessed with sex.
--- 73191525

I see it as an issue of declining intelligence amongst the users of this board. Being friendly, funny, witty and less of a coomer is all stuff that correlates with intelligence. The filter needs to get more complex and preferably mobile users should be filtered out.

it makes zero sense why the retards that run this board wont just make a board like old r9k with no porn allowed. 

porn attracts the dumbest of retards and shits up everything. should be banned off the site entirely except a couple boards. porn addicts are owned by the jews not even real humans IMO.
--- 73191595

The retards running this board are the retards running this entire website and they couldn't care less about the state of /r9k/. This board would improve absurdly if it was blue but it's not like we can just vote or send a petition to the admins asking to make it so.

Thats because you haven't met zoomers who had the capability to become robots. In every school, there is potentially one or two kids who everybody thinks will be the next shooter. They aren't, and will probably never harm anyone, but everybody thinks it. Potential bots are exceedingly rare. This placed used to be a nexus of sorts for those of our ilk, and meeting those who were like us "was" easy. This is no longer the case. 

Do any of you remember the media that most robots would've watched in the past? Taxi Driver. Falling Down. Etc.

Old /r9k/ was a miserable dump.
People bickering about their terrible lives and how lonely they are before telling eachother to commit suicide over minor disputes.

But yes, it was a thousand times better than this.
I hate what has happened to this place more than you can even imagine.

I'm similar. It's been about 8 years since my last gf (and the last one I had I only got by spamming threads begging for a gf until one happened to live near me and send me an email to my throwaway email address).

It should be and one group and only one group ruined
>/lgbt/
With all the their troon theads, anti-incel threads, anti-male threads, sissy porn threads. Because this place has no topic -- they ruined it.

Mods wont give us as way to make them fuck of or just declare this a non-porn board like /pol/. This is 30% of the reason I started hating gays/faggots/troons so much... we see how evil they are and destroy everything around them with sexual degenerate fetish obsession. 

>>73191238
Yup and one thing is it's obvious they organize off-site on discord and come over here, that's why it's a flood.
--- 73193049
>>73191548
It's also the same bait as /pol/, exact same threads and images. They can't lie and pretend to be authentic, organic users of the site and not just raiding, spamming assholes.

Mods need to finally fucking do something about the goddamn troons ruining this entire website. But we know why they won't. 

All we can do is make a thread when we can and collectively slide their shit off /r9gay/ needs to go the fuck away back to their containment board. 4chan USED to get people who annoyed everyone under control see /mlp/ and /lgbt/... we gave them fucking containment boards. They still want to ruin every other board.

Well-said. It's only recently I've dropped back in, and the place has changed drastically since the old days. Like OP said, no one really contributes to anything anymore and is unfriendly by default instead of when its warranted. It seems like a constant stream of weird porn shit and one-upsmanship, with everyone is determined to be angry at everyone else for not being XYZ enough, even if the posts would be perfectly at home on the board before.

>>73191409
>>73191507
>old robot culture and robot mentality and robot sensibilities weren't passed onto the newfags
Yeah, it's a problem with the site in general, or any community that gets popular, really. They flood the platform and don't conform to the culture. Since they outnumber the original population, the new people become the norm and the originals get edged out. There's no pressure to adhere to or respect what was there to start with or even a way to be aware of it sometimes. It happened on the site after a certain van exploded, it happened on infinity when the later exodus happened and again when /b2/ got made, and it happened in a lot of less related places, too. Modern whiny incel shit isn't in the spirit of robotics at all.

>>73192077
The "you will never" sadfrog spam in 2011 made me want to strangle whoever started that. It was every other thread on the site and managed to make /v/ even worse, and that's hard to do in any era.

If you're talking about conforming to a culture you are the problem on this website and need to fuck of.
This website is for misfits, not normniggas

Because none of these people were original group. They're from different places, making this their own hellhole. It's the same zoomie normie behavior we see all over the site. Everything is a competition to see who can LARP as the Chad... when /r9k/ invented Chad Thundercock as the Great Satan around her.

>Yeah, it's a problem with the site in general, or any community that gets popular, really. They flood the platform and don't conform to the culture.
I'm writing novels and short stories and trying to launch that career... one of the novels I'm pinning in the future is going to try and tackle this using a metaphor, based on 4chan, to explain how newcomers, tourists, immigrants generally tend to destroy cultures and vulture off their bones. 

Point being -- this ingrained into human behavior. The human CAN NOT respect it's elders and previous established cultures and wants everything restarted at their own feet with every generation. This is bad for humans actually, it's more advancing to respect the past and other cultures and continue it then to redo it every 5-10 years like zoomies have done.
--- 73193366
>>73193305
We "conform" in our own way though, we use our own slang and terms and concepts, so a baseline conformity is necessary, even among social misfits.
--- 73193382
>>73193305
Don't be disingenuous when you know exactly what I mean. I've watched this website since it was first created, and normalfags flooding the platform without bothering to learn how shit works on here is part of why it's so bad nowadays. If everything were just dandy then there would be nothing to discuss and the state of the board/site at large would be considered the same and just as good as it's always been. I'm not against new people since it keeps a place from dying or becoming stale, but flooding this board with simp threads goes against the spirit of the place. You have to draw a line somewhere or it all tumbles down and becomes unrecognizable.

>>73193357
>then to redo it
Funny how that happens with everything, isn't it? All the people who remember the previous big war have died, and so now we have another one. Having a longer memory in general for everyone would be really nice.

Funny cause you mention simp threads.
I recently browsed archives from 2006-2012 and it was full of simping.

Yup. Old 4chan was filled with smart nerds who read books, had good educations and were just getting together to be goofy with each other. New 4chan is just zoomie normies flooding in here and being the same people they are everywhere. They're too illiterate to read posts and understand them, too mean spirited to be polite and turn every thread into a flame war. 

>The filter needs to get more complex and preferably mobile users should be filtered out. 
Definitely. I rarely phone post but I noticed when I do, it's hard to write up more than a sentence or too an I dont save and post pics from my phone. A lot of phone posting decreases general discussion. Phone posters don't want to scroll through something that's easily readable on a PC/laptop, so they demand everyone dumb everything down and shorten themselves.
--- 73193908
>>73193436
I'm not pretending, but I'm willing to concede that rose tint is a factor in anything. A lot of the threads that were "epic" at the time aren't that amazing when you go back over them, but at least content was being made and conversations were happening. It was about sharing stuff and having fun. It seems like there's a lot more porn and threads like that now than anything else, but I'm going just based on what I remember and memory can be selective. Doesn't really change that the site goes through degenerative shiterations every 2 years or so.

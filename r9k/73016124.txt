if you didn't spend the majority of your 20s together with her, you're not in a real relationship with her, because her true and honest self is involuntarily and irretrievably hidden behind the damage aging does to the mind and personality. she is already established in life so you can't grow together like normal couples.

there are no genuine relationships that start after 25. they're all a shadow of real relationships that start before that.

There is no authentic self you moron. We are all irreparably broken from the moment of birth.

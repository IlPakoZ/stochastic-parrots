Depends what you mean by smarter. The average person today can read and do math, unlike the average person in the past, but the people of the past could grow their own food and make their own clothes. If the world was going to end tomorrow the average computer programmer would die of starvation while a farmer without a high school education would survive for years.

Most people learned about what their parents did from their parents, then picked up for their parents after they got old. If they lived in a town or city, they could also try to become the apprentice of some other worker, and take up that job instead of their parent's job. Rich people had private tutors and schools, where they could learn more traditional academic things like math, science, philosophy, history, etc. I would say that the average person was much more specialized in their knowledge than they are today. Today, most people know some basic academic trivia, but they end up working brainless spreadsheet jobs because they don't have any specialized knowledge in a field that actually needs them.

Why the hell are women allergic to having kids?

I grew up in a big family and I fucking hated it. I doubt you have the emotional bandwidth to raise multiple kids. My dad didn't neither did my mom. All kids end up being sad and neglected. The max number of children you should have is 2 and even that is pushing it. You aren't a farmer that needs kids to push the plow. Grow up.

Fear of responsability. Women nowadays dont like to have to be responsable for anything. Nothing should be at their fault, and thus having kids would interfere with their lala land lifestyle

That is DEFINITELY something worth breaking up over. Immediately dropped, no questions.

women were made to have kids. have sex. dilate. mald. seethe. cope. touch grass.

Hate children cos I had to babysit my 12 younger cousins all my life so can't relate (also children are expensive)

>>73062034
It's sad you have nothing to say in defense of your emotional bandwidth to raise kids
It's sad you never see men saying how they want to raise a son to be a strong and good man, teach him what he knows, guide him to be a success. Men don't want to actually parent they just want a legacy with no work

Wait..... who talks like this? Who just says "a girl" when talking about their gf when they are in their late 20's? I am calling larp on this because it's odd. Why not say my gf

>>73061995 (OP)
Because do you realize how much she would need to give up? Or so you want to rase the children? Do you know how emotionally draining that can be. Like damn my prents had me and my sister and i got the short end of the stick and got neglected because they only had time and energy for one

Dump that bitch yesterday.
t. divorced for this reason. I'd rather keep trying to find another woman and risk dying alone than continue a childless marriage.

How can you raise a child if you can't even read 3 sentences
--- 73062171
>>73062077
No, because my grandma had 6 kids and they all turned out to be functioning members of society
--- 73062175
>>73062123
what she said was right. typical male blaming the mom for your dad never caring about you as a person.

t. a man

Functioning doesn't necessarily mean thriving or healthy imagine how better off they'd be if resources weren't stretched between 6 kids

What exactly do you think they missed out on by being part of a large family besides potentially not existing?
--- 73062244
>>73062010
Yeah. That's how life works. People want to be happy and they're not going to do things that make them unhappy for something that only benefits you and your ego in some vague way. Either figure out how to reproduce without women or shut up and kill yourself, there is no third option.

Why does it feel like I can tell what the gender of the posters in this thread are just by reading the posts?
--- 73062320

You must be female, for example, because you made this passive-aggressive bullshit post instead of just quoting the ones you don't like and calling them faggots.

Why would you create children in 2023? The state has ownership over whatever spawn ur whore wife will produce, autistic or not.

You cannot sit here as a dude with cock and balls and pretend that it's no big deal to have a baby pushed out of you. It's just not something you even have to consider. 
If she doesn't want to do it, it's her choice. If she is lying about something this serious, then what else could she be lying about? Even if she isn't, this is certainly enough to justify a divorce. She is voluntarily choosing not to have children with you. It is entirely her choice, but you are absolutely free to find someone who will actually commit to the purpose of marriages. 
She probably just is terrified of the way your life gets turned upside down and becomes dependent on the kid. For autists like us, it's not a big deal to lose our friends or socializing because we don't do much of that. I can imagine someone with friends and stuff to do would actually care that all they can do is baby stuff. personally I just jerk off and play games from last decade, so I'm fine with doing something more serious.

well, for eurofag wagies the answer is obvious. nobody wants to toil away for 8h a day and then come home to raise a baby, slaving away instead of enjoying life. if shes an american sahm she played you

in any case, she should have been honest about her wishes. the kid issue is definitely a biggie and is worth breaking up for if partners aren't on the same page
--- 73062485

Your only option unironically is to dump her and find someone with your same values. She lied to you as part of a deception campaign, and that is a moral failure on her part.

Relationships must be built on trust as their foundation. A single lie -- that being not wanting a large family -- is a failure on her part, not yours. She will never respect you ever again if you let her get away with this.
--- 73062888
She lied to you and is using you while wasting time. Don't even break up with her, you've already wasted too much time. She'll get the idea when she sees you with someone else.

Explain to her that for the sake of the kid's health, you should have them before your 30s.
Early 20s or before would be ideal
--- 73063343
who wants to start a 3 child family with some chud on pennies. How fun itd be to slave over 3 kids while the husband is making shit pay all while being absent for it. 

if you made 300k a year girls wouldnt mind having lots of kids. The equivalent for men would be working 3 jobs for 30k a year.
--- 73063351
>>73061995 (OP)
because women have to actually get pregnant and birth the kid. from their perspective, having a kid means having to take several months off work just for pregnancy and post-partum period alone, followed by spending a ton of time raising it. this would absolutely make it harder to advance in her career, assuming she has one.
>>73062005
OP's saying he should break up with her though, which is totally fair

>wait til late 30s

20 years of effort for only 1 kid

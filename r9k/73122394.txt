This post is of utmost importance r9k! More important than your BBC blacked threads, more important than your cuckolding threads, more important than you "I'm a fembot and here is some bait reasons for you to give me attention" threads.

It is of utmost importance that you tell me your favorite taco fillings.

I rarely make mexican food. For some reason I usually can't find boneless pork butt or shoulder, but that makes the best filling for tacos. If I can get a chuck roast for really cheap I might do that sometimes, usually it's chicken thigh. A can of beans and some rice on the side and g2g, that weird tomato chicken powder makes good rice. 
It's a lazy meal which is nice but when I don't feel like cooking I usually just make steak skewers marinated in soya sauce and pineapple juice or arab chicken marinated in yogurt. Potatoes and mushrooms with steak skewers, Hummus, garlic sauce, flatbread with chicken.
Nice thing about mexican is it makes way too much sauce. Usually get another three or four meals out of it that way. That's enchiladas though, not just plain tacos.

Do you keep yourself well groomed?

haven't brushed my teeth in 5 years, haven't had a haircut since 2011, and really why bother? nobody's nice or worth a fuck

Yeah no. I only take a shower at best.
>>72978920
Same but I just shave my head because long hair makes the scalp itch if not maintained.

I just showered a few hours about, shaved, used moisturizer on my legs, used an exfoliator on my face. I'm now laying in a pile of freshly washed blankets. I feel very clean and comfy.

Yeah I do. Part of my job description really. Also I'm vain and I like when people give me validation for my looks.

Not well enough. I should probably showed daily instead of twice a week, I only change my underwear when it's visibly filthy. And I don't brush my teeth daily either. Or brush my hair daily. I need to take better care of myself. I often go out without deodorant too, and I don't change my clothes unless they smell. I need routine instead of damage control.

That's not part of a cleaning routine.

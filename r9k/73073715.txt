i've been a shutin for the past several years, then i got sick and even more shut in, now i'm finally recovering from surgery. i'll ham things up for the surgeon at my followup so he tells the insurance company "there is no way this man can go back to work before June" which gives me a month of perfect health, the start of summer, money in my pocket and a big city to spend it and party in. what do i do in order to meet tons of people, quickly forge a tribe of people who like me and having me around, while being handicapped by autism and social anxiety? i used to like comedy clubs i guess, back in another life

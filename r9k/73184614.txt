i just cant use 4chan anymore this site is done for. reddit is unironically better now.
--- 73184635
yep, fucking zoomer faggots ruin everything
--- 73184710
Reddit is dogshit, no matter how cringe the 4chan community is, it will never surpass how dogshit reddit is.

I got banned on multiple subreddits just because I was participating on other subreddits, no other reason, when I asked a moderator if he's retarded in a private chat I got perma banned from reddit for harassment and the niggers kept banned any new accounts I made, I still how one more account they didn't ban I made a few years ago but the name is something like kukluxklan to your house nigger, I can't post with this name

i can find small communities without zoomers. that does not exist here.

>reddit is unironically better now.
maybe you always belonged there? ive tried to do reddit and each time within less that 1 day came back here. its like 2/3 bots. Most subreddits, you can only post something along the lines of exactly what they want to see, anything slightly different then your post is removed and you're sometime even banned from the subreddit
--- 73184779
>>73184614 (OP)
What are our options for other imageboards?

Anything that could take 4chans place? Even remotely?
--- 73184783
also the karma system is a self enforcing rule by popularity, and bots control what is and isnt popular. reddit truly couldnt get any more NPC

Good. Go back. 4chan would improve if we could get rid of your kind.
--- 73184801
>>73184779
they all fucking suck. at best they get a few posts a day.

Don't know about that one chief

you realize you can pick and choose what subs you see right

>>73184801
If we all migrate over to another imageboard it would be more active. We just have to choose one we like and post there.
--- 73184851
>>73184817
yes and all the subs, every single one, is run by the same type of people. ive done my farewell dance like you a few times, thinking id realized reddit isnt really so bad, but i always come back. nearly all redditors are either bots or people who are such npcs that they didnt realize theyre being influenced by bots, and became bots themselves

you will never be able to talk about any opinion or point of view that isnt woke leftist antifa shit

have fun even in gaming, nature, or music subs having to see in the top posts some virtue signal about black people or trans rights anyways and realizing "wow, this is my community now"
--- 73184862
>>73184814
reddit is the new 4chan
--- 73184867

Can I call people slurs on this "reddit"?
--- 73184869
>>73184817
on here, despite the trolls, you come across human interactions with people who are truly human rather often. but on plebbit its quite literally nearly impossible. if you dont take your bluepill everytime before accessing the site youre bound to draw the attention of mods and bots and be cast out.
--- 73184877
>>73184851
i see more tranny and retarded shit here more than anywhere now

I wonder why you struggled on reddit. Who knows?

At least threads there have something worth reading. Seeing 14-year-old #30512 post the same three fucking wojaks day in and day out is just sad. I tried to contribute here and start threads but they are drowned out by racebait porn garbage and losers wallowing in self-pity.

The 4chan experiment showed us you can have successful anonymous lightly-moderated forums UNTIL the masses are let loose on it. Then it becomes the most basic, trashy, stupid, pit of non-thought that bleeds users until it is an empty wasteland.

to be fair 4chan was decent until zoomers.

yea but its easy to ignore, and i dont hate trannies or blacks or anyone, its the enforced virtue signalling and shilling. And its strictly against the rules to be critical of ANYONE except le straight, and/or white, men
--- 73184927
>>73184913
last time i was on reddit on a food sub and everyone was just complaining about how their cuisine was stolen and appropriated by white people, just like white people steal everything from the poor blacks and ethnics (lol). One guy made the mistake of asking what they were even talking about and got dogged on by all the white hating shitskins then once he was banned went back to their circlejerk about le ebil white people who JUST CANT stop stealing from them. Literally nuke it
--- 73184930
>>73184927
reddit is retarded but i see none of that. the entire internet is shit now.
--- 73184954
>>73184930
>the entire internet is shit now.
i know, and thats why i come to 4chan, because its not the enforced shittiness of anyone. everyone can put their shitty opinions out there and if you dont like it you can either ignore or cal them a retard
--- 73184957
>>73184954
if you post anything mods dont like they ban you and you get 0 replies unless you talk about trannies
--- 73184968
>>73184957
ftmp on 4chan you can post anything that can even slightly be reasoned to be ontopic as long as its not porn or gore except maybe on /v/ or /a/ the mods there are faggots
--- 73184978
honestly. Reddit has always been better, but only in some ways

I always leave reddit learning something cool about life or a great anecdote or seeing some oc from an interest of mine

meanwhile on 4chan, yeah the opinions are a bit realer and darker and honest, but ninety percent of r9k is just self wallowing, racebait, retardism, trannyposting, zoomers flexing their relationships, egirls. all just mind numbing discussion that isnt reflective of me at all. i look for the 10 percent of posts that actually mean anything and they still suck at that.
--- 73184982
For me, the anonymity is still a big draw over the faggot hive-mind. Though it is good for nudes as well.
--- 73184986
>>73184978
was going to agree until you posted a foid. fuck off m8

nah it is about the same in quality imo. people were more retarded on reddit before actually
but have fun listening to the same five trannyposter and racebait horndogs circle jerking threads on here for the next 20 years

puts on fedora
its time i becum a redditor
--- 73185021
>>73185014
>nah it is about the same in quality imo. people were more retarded on reddit before actually
Before 2016 you could actually read posts on Reddit and reasonably assume it wasn't just disinfo. But now everything on the internet is fake and gay, and you can't even look at something like /r/worldnews without going in with the assumption some party is trying to influence you
--- 73185023
>>73184968
the decline of /a/ makes me sad, it seems to be mostly stuff that should just be on /e/ and bots spamming retarded shonen generals that are "technically not generals so it's okay". occasionally you get a good thread and I stick around for those but the ratio is pretty low. picrel, there was a kaoru mori thread a while back and that was lovely.
--- 73185038
>>73185014
>its time i becum a redditor
then go. why are you still here? maybe youre just trying to pretend youre not here forever even though you know in the back of your mind, youll be back. youll always be back. you just need a short break, everyone needs a break sometimes. 

>t. made my farewell declaration like you 15 times by now
--- 73185047
>>73184710
Theres literally more trannies on here than reddit
--- 73185057
>>73185038
im probably just going to shoot my self soon this world is hell now.
--- 73185058
>>73185047
theres more on reddit but every tranny is terminally online so every social media site is filled with trannies
--- 73185063

hope you have a blessed day

brutal but fair, being a zoomer isn't good for 4chan. I am one at 19.
--- 73185309
>>73184614 (OP)
Don't subreddits ban redditors simply for posting on other subreddits they don't like?
--- 73185326
>>73185309
Subreddits are basically comparable to user-created boards on 8ch. So the admin has control over the site as a whole, but most decisions are left to the userbase of given fandoms
--- 73185331
>>73185309
yea, also youre only allowed to be a cis white male if you make sure to apologize for it with everything you do

many times when i posted on reddit the people (or probably bots, at least some of them) would bring up my post history and be trying to use it as a weapon against me

No wonder this site sucks. Look in the mirror faggots. All of you are the problem.
--- 73185859
>>73185637
prob the reasonfor the constant racism and troon hate, and woman hate. gotta be ultra tolerant on reddit, then they come here where they can say what they like, and have a fucking field day

im sure some truly just hate black people, troons, and women regardless but that has to be at least a good bit of it

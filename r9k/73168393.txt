If I was in a situation where my thoughts were being forcibly read, I would invoke my late-teens edgy self and go into incredible detail about how I would murder everyone in the building and rape every woman and child within a square mile. If the thought police is real, I'm going for a high score.

I hate the anti-christ. Now we won't even be able to be alone in our own head.

I can't wait to get wrote up at my wagie job because their brain scanner didn't detect enjoyment when I was forced to do the wagie dance.

Nope, everyone will be too scared of getting found out that even their thought patterns will change in hopes of avoiding being canceled.

This tech will save millions, selfish chud

Who cares about that wokie shit.
Can you imagine what even an actual reliable lie detector able to run on their phone during everyday life would do to normie relationships or employment?
Or the absolute shitstorm that would follow if everyone else can tell by peeking at a screen whenever someone, male or female, gets sexually aroused under their social facades?

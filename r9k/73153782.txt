Doesn't he have a child and have a clone of his dead wife?

His wife was a schizo bitch who manipulated him into having sex and used him as a pawn.
>>73153795
He was too busy saving the world aka scheming for reuniting with his waifu.

He had like 3 bitches though. How is he even close to being an incel?

>>73153845
Wait what. Those rule 35 images are getting too real and not exactly a deadbeat cause he was busy being some CEO guy.
>>73153860
I never said he was incel. I just incels should try to being like him. Also one of them was a schizo bitch trying to manipulate him and another one was an old hag granny he didn't like at all. I dont know who is this third one you are talking about.

His wife, I dont think she was a schizo, and you have all the rei clones maybe. 
Then you have the blond lesbian and her mom.

>His wife, I dont think she was a schizo, and you have all the rei clones maybe. 
His wife was a schizo through and through and the mastermind behind everything. All those Rei clones were soulless for the most part. Okay Dr.Akagi liked Gendo I give you that. Her mother was but a old women taking benefit of young Gendo which he didn't like at all.

His schizo wife didn't like him either.Thats a retcon from the Numovies.
She fucked over him during the impact. She only cared about Shinji.

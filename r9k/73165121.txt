I got dumped 3 weeks ago and I had more free time than usual. I kept reading all this incel whining and I am frankly fed up with it. I am a biological single woman and I am open to dating one of you just to show you how wrong you are about all that lookism crap. Convince me that you are an interesting guy and better than other robots in this thread and we will give it a try.

That is what I am talking about when I said I am fed up with incel crap. You keep complaining about how we only care about how you look but you aren't even going to try and court a woman like a guy is supposed to.

Tits or GTFO, fag.
I am not even surprised by the fact that this wasn't original.
--- 73165164
>>73165121 (OP)
I am a tall male and I like to sleep, I work hard and then sleep, did i mention I love sleep? 
So if we were dating you, we would sleep in my house and sleep all day and all night, we would wake up and eat, chat for a while then sleep.

If you like sleep , pick me.

For what reason? There are literally Netflix shows who have done exactly what you are trying to do and the same shit happens when they finally meet. The spark ends. I have done the monkey dance enough for girls irl to even bother do it for someone who could most likely just be a man or a tranny. I have lived a life that a lot of people that I have talked to think is very cool but it means nothing.

From what you've seen you should probably lurk more, as I said, TITS or GTFO.

Interesting in the eye of the beholder. I play piano, i like reading, i do jiu-jitsu and go to the gym (i'm wanting to start rockclimbing but i don't want to fuck up my gym schedule), i like watching YT and movies and stuff liek that. Idk if that's interesting for you.

"Incel" is a social construct dude, you don't have to adopt all the new terms kikes spew out.
--- 73165469
I like fish. I don't like fishing, because it hurts the fish. I like to watch them. They have interesting personalities when you really pay attention. They're like us but smaller scale. They learn quickly as a group and forage when the conditions are right. They like enrichment like plants and driftwood which encourages natural behaviors. Microbes are important for the health of a tank as with the increase in biodiversity, so too does the increase in available nutrients which in turn feeds plants which feed the scuds/ostracods/copepods which feed the fish. It's important to create an environment that mimics nature to maybe 90% accuracy, minus the brain eating amoebas and parasites.
Also I'm 6'5" not that it matters lol
--- 73165473

I'm an oldfag /b/refugee. I'm edgy but not deranged about my xenophobic tendencies, I'm mature enough but still fun. I breed animals for a living and that gets pretty interesting and I'm always happy to show off what I've got. I have a deep voice, and I'm pretty open minded about what other people believe/enjoy. I'm not really interested in online dating but if you actually want to chill in vcs together and get get to know each other I'd be down to drop my discord.
If not, good luck in your incel edutainment endeavors, you're going to need it.

If I didn't put 6'5" in there you'd be like "woah this guy's crazy.. nah.." and try to justify it like that. Now you're trying to justify it by saying I lied, I did. It can't even approach the feeling of hearing "INCELS DON'T EXIST IT'S YOUR PERSONALITY". That's the biggest lie I've ever heard bro. I raise animals, I'm honest and respectful to everyone I meet, I try to be as helpful as possible but NO there's GOTTA be an ulterior motive, I GOTTA be some kind of evil disease in the social immune system. The only thing separating me from being a literal god in your eyes is being about 6 more inches off the ground. For now I'm the soon-to-be-deceased little brother.

It is not peacocking it is courtship. It is incredible to me how you guys act.

I created an instagram account just to talk to a childhood friend who is a girl I was into and who was into me, she just broke up with her bf and I reached out asking if she wanted to talk, its been years and I feel weird trying to get in contact, would you be creeped?
--- 73167036
>>73166997
>would you be creeped?
Yes. And also don't try. She probably doesn't remember who you even are. And even if she does reaching out to someone from so long ago is clearly desperate and you should get your life in order first and not be desperate before you try looking for a relationship.

When we knew each other I was dating another girl who I didnt really like, and I turned her down and one night at a church sleepover we talked in a room for like 2 hours in the dark cause she didnt want me to see her crying, she was sad cause I was with the other girl who I left to talk to her, I regret my decision to this day and nearly cried thinking about her crying the other night.

My favorite book is Nightwood by Djuna Barnes. I only date women who read books, so hopefully you fulfill that need for me.
--- 73167496
>>73167482
No I don't. And I don't like guys who make demands like this, so we are better off going our separate ways.
--- 73167514
>>73165121 (OP)
No thanks, I'm good. 
Barring lookism crap, why should anyone bother to court you? Because you're a biological female? By virtue of being here, you're already a worse mate than the average male here.

>virtue of being here
A friend showed me this place about a month back and we had a great laugh. I checked back a few days later myself and I kept looking through topics. Started off as having a great laugh but then I realized you guys have some serious issues and I figured I would try to help at least one of you. But this is what I got in return, which honestly was kinda what I expected.
--- 73167566
>>73167546
What exactly were you expecting with that attitude then? Of course you're going to get shit on lmao.
--- 73167621
>>73167566
You guys are literally choosing beggars.
--- 73167631
>>73167621
Most of them definitely are. But that doesn't answer my question. You get what you put in, don't be upset when no one wants to put up with shit lmao.
--- 73168084
Well I am done with you guys. You are totally irredeemable and I feel much better now knowing that there is a reason you are all alone.
--- 73168144
>>73168084
Yeah yeah you totally owned the inkwell. Keep it pushing dweeb
--- 73168217

I didn't read the thread, but you seem nice and intelligent and I can be your boyfriend.
--- 73168246
>>73168217
You came off as the nicest guy in here which is sad cause the effort you put in was absolutely minimal. Still better than all the voluntary incels here. What is your discord id?
--- 73168289
>>73168084
Thats mean, most of us are pretty fucked, but thats still mean, feels like you came on here to sadistically toy with all of us.
--- 73168311
>>73168246
Had to say his effort was minimal.
--- 73168331

Know that you could do better than some sadistic attention whore. Hope you find real love someday anon.

I am not sadistic.

You seem it, dont mean to be mean myself I just have sympathy for my fellow robots.
--- 73168367
>>73168360
If I seemed sadistic there would be a lot of guys here happy to prove themselves.
--- 73168371
>>73168344
After reading the whole thread you do seem a bit sadistic.
--- 73168379
>>73168344
I was originally kinda rooting for you to find someone here, but you seem to think so lowly of all of us, and thats just mean. I get that most of the people on here are fucking retarded, but some people in this thread seemed pretty nice and you call them irredeemable and say you dont feel bad for their lonely state.
--- 73168401
>>73168084
woah woah woahhhh I just got here gimme a chance
I'm getting my bachelors in economics and I'm planning to get my masters as well. Everyone describes me as nice but also a little "crazy," only bc i like drinking bourbon and I try to hook up with girls (I wouldn't do that if we dated obvs), but I don't think I'm too "crazy" I'm fine. pls gimme a chance im cool, and mist ppl say im "good looking"

Stop bumping your own faggot b8 thread. An actual female just posted tits. Stop posting in this thread you fucking faggots.
--- 73168413
>>73165160
>like a guy is supposed to.
anon, guys aren't "supposed" to do anything. hoeflation meme is real, the person who made the phrase made it as a joke but unironically you have to put in 10x the effort your parents or grandparents did for a woman 10x worse than your mother or grandmother ever was.
you think women deserve to be courted by default: they do not. courting is proportional to the womans quality. if you're a bpd cunt, throw tantrums and moods, can't control your emotions or anger, massive standards - most of which have nothing to do with love or caring for someone else, brainrotted from 500 tinder interactions and social media, slampigged and ran through by 2 dozen people, have no actual interests or personality enough to be able to hold a unique conversation with unique responses and not just pre-determined "this is what all normies think or say about x/y/z" etc, why do you think you deserve to be courted in some special way?
nice women will be courted, good women will be courted, everyone else will get the effort put into them they deserve, which is not a lot on average
not only is your thread thinly veiled bait, but even then it's still demanding guys be a fucking jester or entertainer, or be some top percentile performer in some field for you merely to be considered. which is, as always, insane

There are though, everyone here basically grovelled and begged for your attention, and I understand them, I just think you were kinda mean and some of them seem like decent guys. Not saying you have to date any of them just saying you could have been more sympathetic and less mean to all of em, though I do appreciate the advice earlier.

All the guys would say she's mighty fine (mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down-to-Mars girls, haha, yeah
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh

You have a very autistic way of grovelling and begging for attention by telling me I am the worst and you aren't going to do your job as a guy.
--- 73168634
>>73165121 (OP)
So you want incels to bust their ass to impress you with absolutely nothing to work on besides starting vitriol from both sides? You'd be insaneto think that there would be anything other than failure as an outcome. And all this will do is reinforce opinions on both sides. This is why no one bothers to try and why no one should. Can't even put the axe down and communicate like human beings before hand. I stopped drawing due to this nonsense.

Guys will do "their" job to court women when that woman is worth it. You're clearly not, head on back to insta and tik tok now.
--- 73168768
>>73168731
Of course I'm not op. Why in the fuck would the woman that this is directed respond positively ?
--- 73168779
>>73168768
Dont know, thought she mightve been being nice.
--- 73168791
>>73168779
Then why would you make a song shit talking her? I thought we were on the same page man, you've really let me down ngl
--- 73168794
>>73168742
Oh I will get back there and easily find a guy 10 times better than any of you. And he will be happy to prove he is worth being with me. I can't wrap my head around how you can even say that I am not worth it while knowing that all of you are unattractive. You aren't in a position to say someone is worth it or not.
--- 73168807
>>73168791
Just hoping she was coming around but I guess she really is Caroline.
--- 73168816
>>73168794

--- 73168874
>>73168794
Yeah I'm sure you will that's great. Careful where you point all that projection by the way. Why can I not pass judgement on you based on how you've acted in this thread? How attractive I look has nothing nothing to do with how ugly your personality actually is.

>>73165160
>but you aren't even going to try and court a woman like a guy is supposed to.

good to see some things never change (namely, entitlement and conceit)
--- 73168930
I have to admit, I really struggle with the question of what makes me interesting. I'm just a normal human like the most of us. (Well, I might be in the wrong crowd to say that, here...) 
I don't think my hobbies distinguish myself in a positive way. Isn't anime usually looked down upon? Aren't visual novels degenerate? I suppose wanting to learn Japanese and digital art are much more desirable in comparison.
I barely work, leaving me with a lot of free time, but most of it is spent procrastinating on my hobbies by watching YouTube or browsing 4chan instead. I procrastinated so much on my academic work that I nearly flunked out of college.
Regardless, I am still looking for love, even if I am not the most desirable human being, a work-in-progress piece in his early stages. Is there someone out there who would like to be with me despite that?
--- 73168969
>>73168930

Well here's an attempt. I'm currently in college on the east coast and I can 
respond pretty quickly to messages if you ever want to talk. I would probably
describe myself as a failed normie cuz I can make friends and socialize with
normal people but i'm not really that charasmatic so talking to normie girls 
is kinda awkward at times depending on their personality. Besides that, I
got a couple hobbies i'm into on the side and I'd probably be down to hang out
w you when I get on break. I'd describe myself as pretty friendly and 
understanding for what it's worth. Anon#8770 is my discord in you're interested.

Also all of you niggers, who actually believe this is a woman and reply to him for a iota of attention are pathetic. I wouldn't tell you to kill yourselves since that'd be bad, however you are so far gone and so fucking retarded that that'd be neutral.
There is a whole fucking board specifically for this where people do actually prove their gender.

>See my dad over the holiday
>After a while I admit how things have been kind of tough and the world seems like a really daunting place right now
>He tells me that he worked to make sure his kids could live a better life than he did (he grew up very poor)
>Ask him how growing up addicted to pornography from age 9 onwards, spending 14 hours a day online, attending mind numbing public school prison where I was taught to hate myself and my culture, watching the world around me worship criminals, having a dating sphere that encourages the disposability of men, not losing my virginity until 28, not being able to support more than one person off of my income, not being able to afford a house, and having less wealth and opportunity than he could ever dream was a better life
>Watch his heart shatter in front of me
I'm sorry. It (mostly) wasn't your fault, dad. But seriously holy fuck watching me on the computer all day and thinking it was funny/I was some kind of tech wiz. That was unbelievably retarded

Damn you have a dad, and he cares about you? Nice. I'm 26 still a virgin, and my mom straight up told me she can't do anything for me and when she dies she's not leaving anything behind. My dad died years ago. I can't find a job. 

You have something be proud of yourself.

Boohoo your dad didn't have the foresight to predict western collapse and the incel crisis. What did he do? He sought to make sure the biggest problem in his upbringing was solved in yours and he accomplished it. He also loves you. There's not much more you can ask of a parent. 
Yes, he saw you on the computer 14 hours a day, but he also saw that your grades were fine, saw how much you liked it, and decided it probably wasn't that bad. 
Maybe if you don't commit suicide and manage to reproduce you can make it your goal to equip your son with the skills and resilience to navigate the future's social climate.

exactly. people forget the age of computers and internet addiction is still fairly recent. so children end up being raised by the internet instead of going to their parents. if you want things to be better, teach the younger generation how to not fuck up their lives with technology overload

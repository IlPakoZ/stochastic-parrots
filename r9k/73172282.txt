If you have autism, you are one of many, but one of a kind. Most people alive on Earth right now have lived many past lives as human and other animals. Autistic people are starseed souls who were pure light energy beings before volunteering to come to Earth and be born a human. They have an important spiritual purpose here, bringing unique energies which are vital to the collective ascension of humanity, along with the dimensional shift of the planet herself. But they have never inhabited a physical body before this lifetime, so being alive never ceases to be strange and uncomfortable, they often struggle adjusting to material reality, and find it difficult to express themselves using language and emotional cues rather than instant telepathy like they do on the astral plane. This is the reason why autism fates are skyrocketing, because more of us are pouring in from the light realms to help raise the frequency of the Earth in this pivotal time. Is this all starting to make sense now?

Love is real, but it is something beyond this world. God is Love, and Love is God. It is the primordial vibration from which physical reality is manifested, and the essence of the soul. Most have forgotten this love once they come to Earth in human form, but more are waking up to it while still embodied, whether through deep meditation, crystal bowl sound baths, binaural frequencies, psychedelics, sensory deprivation chambers, lucid dreaming or astral projection. It is the destiny of mankind to bring in this pure unconditional love from the aetherial realms into our present time-space reality as we collectively shift into the 5th dimension. The autistic starseeds among us are here for a very special purpose, we are awakening to this divine love and anchoring it within the planetary consciousness.

If you are OP, you are a faggot, like many OPs but a fully fledged faggot

This is an /x/ post. I don't think robots will respond nicely to this kind of idea

Telepathy works by rapid symbolism. You create the broadcast thoughtforms using the symbols to evoke emotions.

New age metaphysics psychobabble bullshit from a leftist feminist who hated men. Tell me again while you retards are reading this stupid shit? If you're looking to get robots to respond to you, they won't be your target audience. You need to go on Reddit and get the fucking weirdos who think that all men should die and we should live in a feminist dominated planet.

Right, I need to go to reddit. The place where I can find many differences from 4chan. The place that is different from here.

Autism is nothing more than faulty brain wiring. Take your delusions of grandeur esoteric cringe bullshit to Reddit. Actually better yet you should kill yourself, because schizo narcissists are worthless

Stop complaining unless you're going to go slay the giant.
You could be studying law.

I don't mind threads like this. This board needs more schizo threads and fewer coomer/tranny/simp threads. Schizo threads are actually interesting.

This reminds me I will make a thread about these certain breeds of schizo soon. They increase in numbers like the breeding of rabbits and probably the most shizo and autistic. The worst thing is this schizo type is supported by all modern communities

My therapist (female) and me are going over the triggers for my depressive phases currently. I've been going to her for a few weeks now. We never talked about sex because i feel like that would be a really bad decision (incels are looked down upon, even harder than autists). So my question to the real robots here: Is it smart to talk about how lonely you are and how much you long for sex with the other gender or should i avoid it?

You should avoid it along with women more generally. Your therapist probably hates you

are you going privately? how much you're paying? how muc do you know about her, how did you find her?

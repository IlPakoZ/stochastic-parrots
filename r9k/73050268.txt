sharing your 20s and establishing yourselves together is essential and non-negotiable for genuine romantic bonding for long term. if she didn't want you in her 20s, she can never love you. also you have to still be in your 20s for it to have the positive necessary lifelong psychological effect.

simple as. all thats left after that is pump and dump.

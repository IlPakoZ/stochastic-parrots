Why do you frame doing literally anything to improve yourself as "____maxxing" as if it's some kind of inherently deceptive or hidden knowledge
--- 73186529
charisma is not real
all of these books about social skills are so barebones and basic that every incel and shut in already follows them perfectly, without even having read them
they're all essentially long list of cartoonish "do not do X" repeated over and over, and they are so stupid that no one in reality would ever do them, they will write whole chapters just repeating themselves over something stupid like "dont throw your shoes at someone" "dont forget their names" etc. and then it has silly made up anegdotes like "Jim throw his shoes at Jack and Jack didn't want to be his friend anymore" 
they never have any actual tips on holding conversations and definitly none for starting them, they are always written from perspective of already having people walk up to you and speak and not stop, the more accurate title is "how to not antagonize friends you already have and not upset people who already love you" but honesty doesn't sell
If you're a shut in who never speaks to people you already follow every advice regarding charisma and making friends that these books contain

true. only legit maxxing is lanzamaxxing

the only thing you learn is that you should be interested in people, and ask things about them. somehow pretending to be excited and say "wow thats cool" for some reason gets people...invested? you can tell that they're pretending to care from a mile but people take up that bait. otherwise the other trick is to be similar to the other person. so if you're not white trying to hang out with whites you won't make it. everything else is a bunch of cope no one cares or does.

I know the niggers on this board hate to see these type of posts, but nofap has helped me a lot with charisma, like even when it came to voice chat I always had this sense of dread. But now it just flows effortlessly

The secret sauce is basically just that once you feel good about yourself most people do know intuitively how to hold a conversation, the thing that trips everyone up is not the mechanics of knowing what questions to ask or how to respond to things, it's overcoming the nervousness that locks you up psychologically. It's like any other intutive nervous system skill like playing a fast-paced game or riding a bike or dancing, if you try to do it "manually" it comes out awkward and stilted but if you can calm down and "let go" it just flows

you cant tell me noone has written a helpful book on holding conversations with new people. i mean i do fine with people i already know. often. or at least when im invested. and i want to be interested in new people, but its not like they come in masses ready to reveal their life story to me so you have to get it out of them. sure i can ask some whore if shes a cat or a dog type of person, but that wont hold a dialogue for more than two minutes.

coincidentally, i am kind of on a semi nofap streak. i recently had the urge to start taking cold showers and do pushups and pullups every day. in the same time, i naturally lowered my porn consumption. went two weeks without masturbating without even trying. but that does not seem too healthy either. my cum came out goopy, snotty and yellowish after two weeks of nofap. i masturbate every couple of days now, no hardcore porn, no 2 hour gooner sessions. some softcore, lesbian or amateur solo stuff.
how are your habits on the topic?

Which is why most people who report being "awkward" or "not knowing how to talk to people" can usually hold a conversation fine with their parents or family members or maybe one or two close friends; they know what to do intuitively they just get caught up in their heads when it's someone they're not comfortable with

talk to me about how to influence a good girl into becoming invested in me

I would sooner give influence advice to someone who said they were going to psychologically abuse strangers, than I would do so to help you retards find a gf

Very shit but im trying my best to go perma mode right now. Longest streak I had was 3 months and it was great. It was easy to maintain conversations with women. In my head instead of treating them like girls I just treated them like dudes in a way and that seemed to net positive results, like they would initiate in a more flirty way. I managed to get an egf around that time too if it counts, she was crazy for me but I slipped back into my old degenerate ways and now im back on square one. Its like they can sense the creepsleazy energy off you but its tough m8 temptation is always there especially when your nuts are full. Im gonna learn an instrument and tarot maybe astrology as well since girls seem to like that stuff. Would make for an easier conversation. Good luck anon and anyone else trying to hit a long streak or perma as well.

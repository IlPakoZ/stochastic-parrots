Obviously the majority of robots will probably be terminally online, shut-in introverts. 

But there's gotta still be a fair share of spergy introverts that like to spend their time outside right? 
So what kind of stuff do you outside robots like to usually do?
--- 73113478
>>73113464 (OP)
I only go outside to smoke weed or ride my bike
--- 73113511
>>73113478
How much/far do you ride your bike? Sounds cozy.
--- 73113601
>>73113464 (OP)
i go out to drink alcohol on the street
--- 73113622
I enjoy going out and hiking the trails around me. There is also lots of greenways and parks to explore. I enjoy camping as well. I can't stand being stuck in the house too much, I start to feel like a caged bird.
--- 73113631
>>73113601
Often? Or just for the night-time cozyness.
--- 73113729
>>73113622
Yeah, now that's what im talking about. Whats the longest trail? Do you ever go camping with other people? Seems super cozy.
--- 73114181
>>73113729
Nothing too crazy. My favorite trail that I go to is just a little 5 mile total trail up and back down a mountain. Then theres another one thats about the same distance only its just a walking trail so there's no elevation change, which makes it really easy. I've went on longer trails before but these little ones are super close to my house so it makes it easy to go often. I live 10 minutes from a state park, and 30 minutes from a national park, so I guess I'm lucky there. Camping is the best when you have someone to go with of course.

Fellow biker 
Best hobby for an introvert, you dont even need to interact with anyone to get fuel. Go anywhere you want at whatever speed you want.
--- 73114212
I feel like a lot of people would be much happier if they let themselves get a little sunlight every now and then. Not staring at a screen 24/7 has some benefits. At the very least, even if you are a shut in its important to keep yourself in relatively good shape. I'm an introvert myself, but for the life of me I can't understand why some people choose to NEET and seal themselves inside.

I play football and it's fine even if I barely speak because I'm a foreigner
--- 73114276

 I have to go outside to do calisthenics, and to work I guess - manual labor. 
 There isn't anything to romanticize about the 'outside' really, unless you know what you are doing and have someone to keep you company it's quite boring.
--- 73114300
>>73113464 (OP)
I just walk. I live in a big city so there's a lot to see just walking. Sometimes I go to old churches, museums or classical music concerts. Sometimes I wake up early and go hiking.
--- 73114396
>>73114181
Sounds lovely, I'm surrounded by fairly decent nature as well. Usually I ride my motorcycle around offroad/semi-offroad and do some soft enduro/adventure biking. I do love hiking as well though. Being outside is very cozy.

>>73114212
Yeah exactly my thought. Vitamin D really helps with mood and you can totally be outside while avoiding other people if you're not a people's person! Also just staring at close stuff all the time can give you myopia. So it's good to go outside and stare into the distance from time to time.

>>73114231
Are you goo?

>>73114276
Hmm maybe it depends where you are! But if you have something you like doing outside it certainly beats being inside (in my experience!)

>>73114300
Like...Really big?
--- 73114495
I can understand why some people don't enjoy going out. I feel bad for the people that live in those urban hellscapes like NYC, San Fran, D.C., LA or places like that. I literally could not. I hate being crowded into densely packed areas like that.. and the traffic too? Fuck that. My city only has a population of about 30,000 and I still feel like that's too much sometimes, but I make the compromise because while my city isn't large I still have easy access to just about everything I need while also being close to natural areas.
--- 73114509
>>73114396
>Really big?
Megacity tier.
--- 73114527
>>73113464 (OP)
I typically stay inside unless the weather is nice and the temperature is decent. Then maybe I'll go for a walk or something.

Have u ever seen "how to" with John Wilson?
--- 73115291
>>73113464 (OP)
i go on hikes or walks in the woods. walk my moms dog sometimes since moms health is failing and the dog doesn't have a lot going for her beyond the walks every now and then. dislike bringing the dog with me because using the leash is a chore but walking without leash is risky, one squirrel and she's gone. she also gets less and less obedient the further away she is because she knows there is little i can do about it.
used to be into fishing when i was a kid but it gets more boring every time. 
bland existence.
--- 73115315
>>73115291
I've never been fishing but I always thought it'd be pretty cool? Well I guess it's nice if u get to eat them afterwards?

Hikes in the woods is very cozy though. Love the smell, especially after a rainy day.
--- 73115372
>>73115315
i guess fishing could be fun but to me it just rips up memories of dad rarely taking us fishing even tho he fished a lot himself and when he did my little sister would ruin everything by getting her tackles stuck all the time and throwing tantrums.
i've also grown soft over the years. i drag up fish and just feel shitty about it. fish didn't deserve that. suppose its different if you're trailing for days and fish to supplement your provisions but i've never really done that.
--- 73115407
>>73115372
Ahh that makes more sense. When I was younger before my step-dad morally got a lot more meek. He used to take me hunting and what I enjoyed the most about it was just like chilling in the moss and such and just taking it all in and spotting animals with the binoculars and such. Good Times honestly. I'm sorry you have some shitty memories about fishing though. I hope you find other outside stuff to do other than being a good son taking out your moms dog from time to time.
--- 73115496
>>73115407
kek. hunting is another one. dad hunted all the time but never brought me or my brother despite promising all the time. we figured bringing kids would scare the animals away or something so we eventually got cool with it. then he brough our little sister hunting, the very same notorious for not being able to sit still and shut up for five minutes, and after that i just lost interest completely in both hunting and trying to bond with dad.
--- 73115727
>>73115496
Sounds like your dad was a real piece of work.

I stay indoors 
Going outside is a waste most of the time because unless you're a douche that thinks that they are ascending above all other humans because they go outside and do nothing for le health benefits, you probably will never find any good reasons to go outside 
the amount of work that has to be put in > what you get out of it 
There isn't much wilderness near to where I live and in reality comfymaxxing in city centers and whatever isn't as good as the movies and whatnot make it seem 
Home has always been more comfy and will continue to be the comfiest place in the world
--- 73115892
>>73115820
I find cities a bit soulless. I don't know about the amount of work that needs to be put in though, isn't it just putting on your shoes? I dunno I just like it...I'm not trying to be morally superior to anyone I just think people should do what they like and I like being outside. The benefits are just an added bonus on top.
--- 73116469
Being completely serious, what is even worth doing outside? I wish I could be the kind of person who enjoys going outside because maybe I'd feel more like I'm living my life, but I just don't, practically nothing out there feels worth bothering with. I don't even think it's the depression, I've always been like this since I was a kid. My interests are almost exclusively autistic things, and every time I go outside to do things I just feel ambivalent at best. I don't feel like I'm having fun, or improving myself, or experiencing anything meaningful, so staying home with my hobbies is just the obvious choice. Even being too depressed to enjoy my hobbies, it's still better to stay home because at least then I'm saving energy instead of stressing myself out by being around other people.

I can instantly get all the music, books, and films I want for free on the internet and have a significantly more comfortable experience with them at home, so it feels pointless to go to concerts, libraries, or theaters.
Eating is not very interesting to me, so I don't go to restaurants and just stock up at grocery stores twice a month.
I don't find sports interesting so I don't play or watch them. Exercising is boring but I can do that at home, so I don't need to go to a gym. I only go on walks when I visit my family to talk to them, otherwise it feels pointless and I get literally nothing out of it. If I lived out in the country I could shoot guns at home, so I still have to go to a gun range, but I don't do that regularly anyway.
>But what about going outside to socialize?
That would be great and absolutely a good reason to arbitrarily go places, except I'm autistic and ugly. You can guess how many good experiences I've had with socialization in my life. People either ignore my existence, or have lukewarm uncomfortable to negative reactions to me.

Go on walks, play some pokemon go, get some food I might like etc

Ill do this once when the suns out and then at night ill skate or walk with a friend.
--- 73117435

>So what kind of stuff do you outside robots like to usually do?
I go jogging at a nearby park and sometimes go hiking at a nearby state park. Always alone, of course. What else is there to do?
--- 73117440
>>73113464 (OP)
I am fat and celibate but have a job in IT so I walk there and back, and go for long walks on weekends sometimes. I enjoy being out in nature when I can, especially in forests or wooded areas.
--- 73117465
>>73113464 (OP)
I used to go hiking, mountain biking, camping, visiting parks and landmarks in my state. I hurt my back so I can't do it anymore. Now I only go outside for a short walk most days.

I was just as much of an incel loser when I was active as I am now.
--- 73117504
Outside stuff? well not much really. I don't think clubbing or partying counts because I'm going "outside" just to go into another "inside" Same thing with going to the movies or shopping for clothes or dancing.

I like talking long walks whenever I have time though, it's good exercise and always found it fun. Not everyone on this board is a spergy introvert lol.

Loooong walks, just wandering the city, live in a bit of a shithole so plenty of abandoned buildings to hold out in, literally walk into random operating buildings, thousands of 10+ story buildings that you don't know shit about, change that. The other day I went into a Buddhist temple and "prayed" in my own sort of way, didn't realize at the time but I was wearing full black block and the only white guy, people probably though I was a terrorist, but everyone's disposition changed when they saw me pray and greet them nicely, very funny. Also walking through alleys and picking up junk to use and make things out of

Hey me too! I ride it pretty much everywhere these days. I do occasionally get some old dude rolling down his window to tell me nice bike lol
--- 73118037
>>73115892
They kind of are, but the sheer volume of possible experiences is great and very underutilized, picture a large city, thousands of massive buildings, plenty of floors each, you could literally spend your whole life just wandering, might get pushed out by security a couple times, but you'll find some real nice and interesting things and people along your travels

I live in the suburbs up in the hills on the outskirts of the city. I love biking to the downtown metropolis, looking at the birds-eye view of the city as I'm traveling downwards. I'll go as far as the waterfront trail going out of the downtown area, and I'll bike till I reach the border going into the next city over. About a two hour bike ride to get there. Went past it a couple times before, but took the bus back home because I was too tired to back all the way back. I bike all around the city taking the occasional break to smoke a fat joint because there's not much in the suburbs.
>>73114205
it's kept me in shape all these years. it's a good hobby when you're a NEET with nothing to do like me.
>>73117546
sounds awesome. guy probably wished he could have as much fun as you!

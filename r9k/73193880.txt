I realized my problem is that I don't want a gf bad enough to work for it settle or compromise. I guess its not really a problem, but when I look at all the shit you have to do to get a gf it doesn't seem worth it and I'd rather just continue down the path of lifelong virginity and singledom. I don't have that strong drive or urge to chase women or reproduce, I just feel lukewarm about it all. I'd take it if it fell in my lap, but I'd never work for it.

yeah same but for me it's not only the whole process of jestering on dates, even if you get a gf you'll have to keep up the act and do stuff with her all the time to keep her interested. I just wish i had a cuddlebuddy or something

The initial approach is just the first part, the actual relationship presents an entire new list of challenges. Maybe its not as bad in reality, but it looks like a mountain of problems from base cam.

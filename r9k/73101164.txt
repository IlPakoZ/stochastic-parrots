I meant then we wouldn't have to have sex and kids but it would be cool to have a boyfriend not piss marking the house too.

I unironically free piss around my house (something I always wanted to do after getting out of apartments). I have laminate flooring so it's not a big deal.

Sometimes i feel some pain and touching them is painfull too, can't i just untwist them? I usually do that based on the fact if it get more or less painfull the way i twist them back. And every time the pain goes away anyway after a while

It's due to a genetic disorder called bell clapper deformity; the testicle does not attach properly to the wall of the scrotum and can swivel freely. Even with his condition testicular torsion is still rare, as the testicles have to rotate at least 360 degrees to begin restricting blood flow.

r*dditors always leave out key details when they get sick
>i got long disease from vaping!
reality they were smoking mystery street heroin for years on the side
>im dying because america healthcare bad!
reality they got aids from being faggots.
in this case in the OP they were hurting themselves with a toy. it wasnt "just masturbation"

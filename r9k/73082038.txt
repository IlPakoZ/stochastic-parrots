Deliriant drugs are fascinating as hell to me. All the replications look rly cool and I just love the idea of being in a waking alzheimer's fever dream. I am drawn to surreal shit.
I will probably never try one though, because I am a pussy, and the experience is pure suffering. Apparently the hallucinations are most of the time more mundane than they're made out to be, and at a full delirium dose of anticholinergics, you will likely be too retarded to care about or even make sense of what's happening around you. But you'll still feel like death physically. Have any of you niggas megadosed benadryl?

As someone who was dumb enough to experience full blown delirium on two occasions, stay away from this shit, any of them, but especially the poisonous plant ones

while they are much better they aren't really the same thing at all. I'm not drawn to deliriants because I am a retarded 13 year old with no access to other drugs. 
I have done shrooms two times, should do it again desu both experiences were pretty cool

its mildly interesting, but if you're going to take deliriants i recommend something other than DPH, it kind of sucks. although admittedly, other deliriants aren't the same as abusing DPH. i would be sooner to recommend datura, myristicin, muscimol etc. but it is a different experience to the antihistamine delirium you get from shit like DPH and doxylamine.

I took a lot of benadryl one time it was like tripping on a RC kinda. It also gave me mad diarrhea.

not full deliriant but i used to trip on ambien. i wish i could go back in time and do it again. funny thing is i do have enough ambien on me to trip, but im afraid of doing stupid shit right now.

Datura is literal poison and will easily kill you if you arent careful, and on top of that the trip feels like a nightmare that never ends what r u saying. Op if you take any deliriant please dont let it be fucking datura

Used to be psychologically addicted to deliriants--ie, my waking life was so bad I preferred to be either in essentially Silent Hill, or experiencing HPPD so bad I was brushing imaginary spiders off my tests all the time. Mostly I wanted to make sure I didn't remember all the shit that waas happening to me, and it did a halfway decent job at it. I still don't recommend deliriants, especially dumb shit like datura. Both the body high and the hallucinations are awful and it is basically early-onset dementia in drug form. I still don't know how much of my memory issues are from concussions, how much is from being choked out, and how much is from high doses of benadryl.

i have, and i can confidently say DONT even try it. unless you wanna feel like death is sitting next to you. the hallucinations are freaky as fuck! kept seeing dead children and huge crabs. also the time skips are scary af! one second im watching BTTF, the next second credits are rolling and im stumbling to the bathroom. youll also have to piss ALOT, water just goes right through you. if you do try it, stay hydrated as dph is a water solvent drug and tell yourself itll be over soon. oh, dont forget to breath.

why were you assuming i was suggesting to take any psychoactives at all without proper research and harm reduction? 
as if abusing deliriants is safe in any capacity.

Tried a intermediate dose one day and shit was pretty ass desu the only cool thing that did happen was I experienced micro dreaming so everytime I was nodding off I got weird ass dream visuals but besides that it was pretty dog shit Id be trying to play doom 3 and I would hear a party going on in my house when everyone was asleep I can only imagine the higher doses

Talked to God on lsd, these things are essentially gateways to other worlds. Each drug its own specific sphere or way of perceiving the spirit world, with its own being or egregore attached to it, there is a specific goddess for datura - wonder what is the spirit of lsd? Probably something with lots and lots of eyes

I think NXT is the most fun to watch week after week, but my favorite wrestler is Gunther.

based, did you start with black and gold NXT or NXT 2.0?

I started before 2.0. I started watching WWE in 2021 when the network was added to Peacock. The Thunderdome era I guess was a pretty bad time to start, but there was good stuff, and overall I'm enjoying the shows a lot now, although I think they've been spinning their wheels a bit since Mania. Hopefully they'll be back on track after Backlash. But one thing that's been consistent is that NXT has always been the most entertaining show to be. Its fast pace benefits it.

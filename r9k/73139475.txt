You're supposed to hold the knife upright on the edge, then with your other hand you need to hit the hilt like it's a hammer. Knife will puncture the aluminum lid, do that going around and when it's halfway you can pry the lid open with your hands. That's how I do it. Won't be hurting yourself lmao.

Does it say on the can not to open with a knife? Or on the knife not to use to open cans? Sue!

Use a screwdriver when you need to open a can without a can opener. Using a knife will fuck the blade

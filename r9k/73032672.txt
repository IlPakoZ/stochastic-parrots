Tired of the bait threads but anyone else genuinely a volcel? like as a kid a girl wanted me to marry her, I had two girls ask me out to prom, been called attractive by girls and had them texting you at night. I brought over a girl to my room in college but I just never cared. I tell people I'm asexual but whatever you bring this up here you just get the standard muh cope seeth or whatever. I see a bunch of threads where about how chad or whatever talks to a girl for a week and has a one night stand and then ghost them or how you want them to leave in the morning or how your wife is boring and so on but I just never relate to any of that. I genuinely just want friendships

I'm pretty much one too. Only because of my low self esteem though. I have pretty bad social anxiety too but I think that has little to do with it because despite all my anxieties, it was my feelings of inadequacy that made me never reciprocate girls' flirtatious gestures.

I've never even had that much interactions with women because how little i got out and exposed myself to them. Plus a lack of social media and general hostility toward ugly bitches from my class, all of this assembled finely. Defo heard about some having crushes on me but it just doesn't cut it for me, too high of a standard or whatever it is.

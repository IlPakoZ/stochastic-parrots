I'm diagnosed with depression, have been since my an hero attempt at 13 where I needed to get my stomach pumped.
I'm 21 years old now, and I live with my fiance and I'm happy, but part of me feels like there's something missing.
I think my brain ironically finds some sort of enjoyment in being sad. Maybe there was comfort in the void, maybe I just found it familiar for way too long and I subconsciously just miss it. I always wonder about this, and wonder if anyone else feels the same.
The feeling of my stomach being pumped sticks out so much in my head and the thought of feeling something like that again has terrified me out of ever being willing to commit sewer slide again. I think even if I was dragged to my lowest, I still wouldn't be willing to out of fear of my last feelings being such an excruciating experience.

I went through the family's medicine cabinet and took bottles of what I could find, and then stole liquor to wash it down. It was after my first breakup, caused by my then girlfriend for a year fucking another dude. I am majorly over it now, so I just consider it another step in my life.

I read your post, anon. This thought occurred to me before and I think you're right. It's all I know it's who I am and I know nothing else. At the same time I would like to be happy and I'm too tired to post the rest of my thoughts

I do [s]hope[/s] think that eventually that feeling will go away for me, but right now it sucks to be doing something that makes me happy, and get a feeling in the back of my head that I don't deserve this type of happiness and should go back to how I was...

I was just listening to some /lit/ lecture earlier today, which touched on melancholics who fall in love with their own pain. It's familiar enough. Repetition is comforting, mindless. 

It's interesting that suicide is such a traumatic concept that you avoid typing the word. I tried to an hero once too, by gunshot. It was an interesting experience - a real internal mental struggle, summoning up the will to push forward with the plan despite something in me fighting to remain alive. I was 24 then, and 30 now. What prompted your suicide attempt? For me it was something like finally recognizing that kindness is a real thing, not just a hoax, and fearing that I'd forever be on the outside of it. It's funny, for me I prolong the sadness by making sure I never quite fit in. I'm so used to not belonging to groups, that it's comforting to be on my own. But that's probably not really out of the ordinary for /r9k/.

Is it just fear of pain that keeps you from death? What would a life that you can be proud of look like? For what it's worth, I strongly believe that being human necessarily involves the feeling of something being missing. Just, normally, people misidentify the void and try to fill it with a nice car or a gf or something, instead of recognizing that the void is a constitutive part of them. The question isn't about how to fill the void, but rather how to find enjoyment in life regardless of the void. There's a real masochistic pleasure in working towards a hard but worthwhile goal, I think.

He's flaking on me again. I don't even feel any love in my heart for him anymore. Not after the way he's 
gone back to making me feel like I'm second place to his ex. Like I'm just a placeholder for someone better to come into his life and have him. This is so disgusting. Being with him is like scratching an itch, not being in love. What have I let myself fall to?

I don't even know who I am anymore. And I'm way too old to still be looking for myself. I don't know what makes me happy anymore. It feels like I forgot how to be happy without him. All I did was use video games and movies to cope before. I envy people who don't have a broken up family either.

I wish someone would save me.

Nigger I wish more women would realize things they had, meaghan could have had everything With me we were in love and yet some snake wormed his way in the second we had a single struggle that would have been solved just talking to me. I thank fuck she went home but I just want to talk to her. I just want someone to care about me. Fuck women for doing such horrible things to people that could have been the world

He must be hot. You can get so many nice guys but you only want dumb chads who don't even want you. Typical

I made a wigger mad because my retard rizz was epic.
At the end of the day, crushes don't matter. I had power over someone else's brain for a day.
I should harness this power somehow.

Save yourself. You picked them you are still with them so quite frankly fuck off and suffer.

You have to get out of that situation first. I'm no homewrecker, I would only save you if you were single.

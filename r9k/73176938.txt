Can somebody please explain to me. Why zoomers on 4chan always larp as millenials? Why would somebody wish to be a millenial? Is it pressure of not being an oldfag or just some attempt at psyops? Explain.

Only 90s kids would get it no cap ondad fr fr doe. Remember pogs? Tfw granny got the good kind of popsicles that you break in half not the kind you cut the top off with scissors. It's Adam and EVE, not trunk or treating. Rembember bicycles? My cousin rented a rated R movie.

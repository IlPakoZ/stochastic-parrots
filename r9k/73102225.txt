Do you think you'd make a good general?
--- 73102250
>>73102225 (OP)
Probably not. I'm not leadership material
--- 73102260
generals are scary as hell
--- 73102275
No, I actually have a soul.
--- 73102307
I doubt I could even get into basic training.

Oh I'm a great leader, I'm leadership material it's just I'm more of a Patton and i get to much envy and I don't kiss ass or kiss.up at all and I'm a ballsy renegade most of the time I'm in my element in chaos
 They killed Patton for being too much of a Chad to and he did step on a lot of toes. . I like leading from the front. I'm all or nothing generally. Which is not always a good thing

I suck ass at hoi4 so no
--- 73103681
i don't think i could make decisions that would result in people dying. that's too much pressure
--- 73103757
Given the proper training sure. I am a quick learner actually.
--- 73103785
No, positions of great power generally attract narcissists and psychopaths. I care too much about my affect on other people, perhaps to a detriment.

I'd do better than most on the organizing and planning, but why the fuck would I want that sort of responsibility? 
Or for that matter, why create some PTSD-ridden soldier boys with the bright idea their post-usage lives turning into a giant shitpile was my fault?
--- 73103853
I know nothing about guns or the army. So probably not. Plus, i'm too much of a pussy to go into the army.

Fuck yeah. Just send in waves and waves of poorly armed, low IQ mutts

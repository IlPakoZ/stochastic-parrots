My belief is that life is essentially this cycle over except as a fractal of events dependent on the past and we never realize we're still on the ride until shit hits the fan.

I'm dumb as fuck with math but it's like X^2+X=the cycle of life where X=your current perspective and knowledge of how the world works

I was 2 minutes away from dying fucked on Xanax and booze and fell on the train tracks. 2 fucking minutes away was the train.
Got to live until I die now and be grateful for it.

Our fallible memory makes these things slip into the shadow, too focused on our daily mundane, we forget, destined to repeat our worst selves again.

I was honestly bro. I still am kinda but at least I don't use Xanax anymore.

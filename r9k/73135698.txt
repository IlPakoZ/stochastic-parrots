Closeted fag here.
Tired of sucking up to straight people. They're very open with their resentment yet I'm supposed to not resent them back. Earlier I've been very critical of SJW kooks but lately I've realized they have a point. Ironically this came from watching someone bashing queer theory and trannies on YT. I've been telling myself "I'm one of the good ones" trying to appease majority society around me by continuously making excuses for their casual and petty hatred. I've come to the realization how pathetic this is, they will despise me regardless. Even as a "good one" I still have to be scared of people finding out. It's bullshit. It's Stockholm syndrome. The majority population is entitled and arrogant and few of them has ever had to feel singled out at any point in their lives while I have to feel this way every single day at work. I have to hide my social disease at any cost. Why exactly? It's all so petty.
I realize most straights on this board also are deviants one way or another so it might be the worst place to make this post but whatever.

are you in afghanistan or something? what does a faggot have to complain about in a developed western country? lgbt propaganda is everywhere, straight kids are pretending to be anything but straight to hang with the "cool kids", you have every right that any other person has (or more if you're a fucking troon). what are you even complaining about? "oh no, some people think putting pp up a man's shithole is gross", what a tragedy.

You sound like you have a bigger victim complex than I do. However pathetic I am, you are far worse.

are you under 18? because otherwise there is no excuse for such a petulant "no, you" argument here. fags are not oppressed in developed western countries, that is the fact of the matter.

Do gays still experience hate? How many straight people are going to have to tell you that they're okay with you before you're finally comfortable? Because there are always going to be some people out therre who think you're gross, deal with it.

But straights are? Oh boo hoo you saw a gay flag? Fuck off.
>>73135786
They don't need to give me their blessing but god damn. I think a retard drooling in their lap is gross yet I don't go on every fucking day hwo I feel about it.
The majority population happily vocalize their judgment because never in their lives they have been judged themselves.

I was on the bus home from work, Straight guy here, and a gay guy of Indian decent walked to the back of the bus and shut the window
A black women opened it again , then a fat drunk man waked passed and said

"look the lady wants the window open , you might be a fucking faggot but she wants it open you fucking gay cunt"

I still have no ideas how a window caused that abuse

Why are you like this? Does being a fag really shift the IQ curve to the left that much? No one here is obsessed with oppression olympics except you. Maybe that's why people dislike you and not so much the fact that you put dicks in your shithole/put your dick in shitholes.

I never see people in public bashing gays though. If you're going to anti-gay channels and reading YouTube comments then what do you expect? For fuck's sake, you gays that get all uppity and pretend you're persecuted when you're not are the most annoying out of all of them. You can't just be happy that you have rights now?

I laugh at every homophobic joke at work every day. How many straightphobic jokes have you ever laughed at in your lives?
You are entitled assholes beating down. There's no way around it.

I don't know because I've never heard a funny one. What constitutes a "straightphobic" joke? Having kids? Wearing loose clothing? Not talking with a lisp? Real hilarious stuff.
>You are entitled assholes beating down.
To what are we entitled? You're the one complaining that not everybody likes you and how your life is so hard because of some mean YouTube comments you read.
>seek approval from people who hate you
>don't receive their approval (shocker)
>"humph! the ess jay dubbayoos were right! heckin' straight people!"
Got news for you: you're not just gay, but also retarded.

Oh noooo. A jooooke. Someone made a JOKE about you. You're so oppressed.

I worked with three gay guys and they heard me fart and said, "oh we found the virgin" and all laughed , I guess that was a joke on being straight 
People joke, get over it

Precisely. lol.

Yes, I am complaining about being made to feel bad about myself every day over shit I can't control. You seem to think one should be able to deride others however you want and then you take issue with the target in question objecting to it. And again it's not about the YT comment section lmao. You seem to think the entire world is Seattle or San Francisco or someplace like that. Try living in backwards bumfuck nowhere and you'll find many other bigots with your exact mentality. Homophobia is a tradition that is very much alive and well, I guarantee you. No need for concern.

Oh wait, misread, you're another straggot trying to dictate the narrative for me.

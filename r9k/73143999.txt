Join the military obviously. If brave men like you fail to volunteer, they will literally have to kidnap unwilling men to do it instead. The answer is clear as day.

>military has shortage of truck drivers
>civilian sector has shortage of truck drivers
The answer is pretty fucking obvious.
Walmart pays it's truckers 100K/year.

if you want to join to military, do so, just remember that you are basically signing your life and body over to the american government for the term of your enlistment and almost always a few years after (inactive duty is a thing). you can also be recalled at any point, depending on branch. military service is lifelong in the usa, in many ways.

if you are not 100% dedicated to this country, the government, the office of the president, the leaders of the military, and do not agree with ANY war that may arise during your enlistment: do not join. your life will likely be a hell from which the only escape is permanent injury. if you want to drive truck, get your CDL and drive truck. you do not have to be in the military to do that and it doesn't make any sense at all to join the military just so you can get truck training for free. it pays for itself in short order.

Shut the fuck up faggot. It's either this loser that does it or some tall blonde high IQ football chad from bumfuck nowhere nebraska that does it. It is better for him to die(which won't happen) that someone who has good genetics. Anyone dysgenic enough to be directionless and post on r9k should enlist asap.

Why not a pick a higher paying/more flexible trade in the military like electrician? Truck driver also puts you in harms way in an actual war (plus is dangerous and not flexible outside of military).

Go get an apprenticeship for any of the trades. In like 2 years you'll be making enough to live on your own. That's my advice.

FAGGOT go option 40 or 11x, literally no point of joining the army for anything but that or OCS

in the current climate you may be right, simply because we've seen enough to know that wars fought by strong men result in a much, much weaker country. what would happen if we sent the weak to fight instead? we're america, we have no enemies in our continent, all our wars are fought abroad on others' land. we could train and send the dysgenic, the weak, the liberal, the mentally ill to fight. give them a gun and some armor and let them go. we would "lose" the war but be a stronger country for it. leave the people who work for a living. leave the people who have a family. leave the people who are in college for reasonable degrees or trade schools.

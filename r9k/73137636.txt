So this is it? I'm going to spend the rest of my life coping with the fact I will never achieve the life I want to live because it is impossible for me to become that person?

normies don't want you to know this one simple trick - you never realized daydreaming about the life you want to live is literally the exact same thing as living it?

Tell me anon, what is the life you want to live? What is your dream in life?

Why would I do that.

It doesn't feel the same at all to me.

I desire either in this world or an isekai that I become an eternally young cute girl in perfect physical and mental health and I get to live a rose tinted comfy life enjoying the world and my body
It's a stupid wish, but it's mine. Anyways, obviously this is never happening.

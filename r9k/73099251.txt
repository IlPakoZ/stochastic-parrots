Whats wrong with you R KID? Not saying that as an insult just wondering if youre mentally ill or lazy or what. if youre just lazy you should ask your parents for time and start exercising and socialising for a year. By socialising I mean volunteering or something not drinking.

I'm fuckin agonising at the state of the forestry and wildlife of this country and to objectively definable decline of the area around me to which I helplessly have no ability to prevent nor regenerate, and you're more torn up over which specific image I use to convey this depression. I ain't no occupational treehugger, but it's fucked that I don't hear a single fucking bird in my area no more, not even a fucking pigeon, collared dove or a crow. It's just dead silent, at best with some chirps in the far-off horizon.

She has connective tissue disease, has to take medication daily and wakes up with really bad joint pains. Yet she gets up and about, lives her life to the fullest as possible and doesn't spend all day on a computer. Her healthcare insurance costs a lot and you get free healthcare. You whingey lads here complaining about tfw no gf do nothing to improve yourselves.

Instead you find ways to chat shit about cute girls online from the comfort of your childhood bedrooms. At the end of the day females do not owe you anything. Yes you may never have a relationship but that's not required to live your life and be a respectful member of society. Females simply don't want unattractive men (lookswise). Just like you, they have preferences. You want Stacy, they want Chad. Either you take the gaypill or you accept your place in this world as a forever alone. Sulking won't get you anywhere.

I'm an uber driver. originally started out of desperation but 100 quid a day is mint. I work 4 days a week, 6 hours a day, about 10-15 fares a day. near enough 5 stars because I give people little bottled waters when they get in and let them pick the music. Piss easy job too, just go where the phone tells you and then head back to the city centre. I only work Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights to take advantage of the increased fares, then Monday afternoon lurking around the train station to get business people wanting lifts to their hotels.

Piss easy job lads.

I've never rated an uber driver less than 5 stars but I can't imagine the kind of person who cares about things like bottled water and getting to choose the music, it''s baffling. It's much better to have a quiet journey with no small talk and the radio on.

--- 73106238
>>73106161
It seems like a brutal tradeoff to me. They get a lot of money without being highly degrading and its not exactly taxing work, but you attract an army of weird people and theres a high likelihood you'll have a legion of dangerous stalkers who obsess over you.

You just said you refuse to celebrate your mum's birthday and you have never bought her a present. That's offline, dickhead.

>>73107479
That's got nothing to do with it. That's just depression. I don't want to celebrate the happiness of others if I am not getting my own happiness. Just makes me more sad.
--- 73107494
>>73107453
You have no offline personality as you spend 24/7 online.
--- 73107531

Your selfish refusal to celebrate your mother's birthday is a huge sign of your personality you little cunt. You're not even clinically diagnosed as depressed. You're just lazy

No matter where you are in life, always love your mum.
--- 73107558
>>73107531
Lazy because I'm depressed. I would be doing so much more knowing I could have a somewhat normie life. Instead I've been pushed to the sidelines...permanently.
--- 73107565
Why should I just pretend everything is ok for the benefit of others? I want to have my moments.

You've never done anything for the benefit of others or even yourself. You are a human being wholly without value. The first I have ever encountered. You have every chance to change that but you won't. You'll just whine and make excuses until you die

Russia is only at war against Israel. Every force of goodness is at war against Israel.

Ukrainians are being genocided by being forcefully conscripted as Israels pawns. Ukrainians want peace and are rebelling against the fake Ukrainian government etc.

The only god is love.
All victory to progress, utopia, Edomites, Canaanites, Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese, true Americans, all Slavs, China, and every white.
--- 73108123
Israel does not have any right to exist.
And it soon will not exist.

Palestine never voted to leave Britain.
Also all blessings to the ever rising amount of white babies being born and Rhodesia and etc

I think DEBATE lad should take a more active part in the thread instead of just dropping a thinker every day and leaving. I don't personally smell like crab juice but I know for certain ruthmong does.

You definitely do smell that bad, you just can't smell it yourself because you've become desensitised to the smell of BO and your own piss. You're one of those guys that people at the shops recognise and try to avoid serving. This is a very real thing that happens, I had the misfortune of working at cex for a few months and there was a whole host of stinky cunts that we'd all try to find excuses not to be on the tills when they arrived. You have a reputation.

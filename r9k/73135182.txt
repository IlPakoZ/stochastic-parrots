they dont look bad at all, i get compliments all the time for them from women and men. they also go with basically any outfit
--- 73135343
>>73135331
Just realized you'd actualyl still be shorter than me since I'd be wearing shoes. For shame op, you hneed bigger platforms
--- 73135358
>>73135327
its only weird to women because its a man doing it. honestly, women who show as much cleavage as the bitch in the pic disgust me. its a poor excuse for fashion

i dont even do that shit, i make sure to cover my any cleavage and i wear shorts under my skirts to avoid flashing cause i dont dress like this for male sexual attention

>>73135343
im actually buying 7 inch platforms next week. theyre goofy looking though
--- 73135429
>>73135358

Based, you could just wear them at home then. The thought of being with a girl 4 inches taller than me is absolute diamonds
--- 73135449
>>73135429
well thats good for you

i would not wear them at home though, and nor do i like the idea of dating shorter men again, even if im only taller than them in platforms
--- 73135456
>>73135182 (OP)
heh, im a 5'10 woman and for a while when i was a teen i thought i would hit 6'. i wish i had, it feels so good to be the tallest person in a room. im strong enough to physically pick up and throw a few of my male friends (a little while ago we took turns throwing each other into a pool and i got to test my strength) and its cool asf. i have this one dude in my friend group whos 5'9 and a half and we have a running joke of me calling him short and him calling me freakishly tall
--- 73135457
>>73135449
>nor do i like the idea of dating shorter men again, even if im only taller than them in platforms
Kek, so you'd only date guys who are 6'4 or taller? Not sure why I expected a positive reaction, femdoms are usually fickle basketcases
--- 73135474
>>73135456

Would you only date shorter guys? Do you find it weird for a guy to be into your height or strength
--- 73135499
Lmao any men can ko you in one hit, even most femine femboy is nire powerfull than you
--- 73135511
>>73135456
aww, that does sound cool. i wish i made it to 5'10 or 6'0, people thought id hit that height too

>>73135457
i like dating people who are my height or a bit taller. i dont like height fetishism and im not into femdom at all lol, i just like height-mogging random men

and to be honest, i already have a boyfriend. hes 6'0. i bought my boots so i could be the same height as him since i fucking hate being so much shorter than my partners
--- 73135527
>>73135499

Not a height fetishist, though I do like tall women. I mostly just like women who get off on having power over other people, for some reason I find that mentality very hot. Also like when women try to mentally dominate me so we can battle each other mentally, I hate weak willed pushovers. 

Don't take this the wrong way, but did you have negative early experiences with men? Why do you insist on not being/feeling shorter? Do you not want to feel reliant on them due to negative early experiences with men? It's pretty interesting that a lot of women like you aren't very into femdom and are usually typical subs with a dominant mindset/twist instead of 'true' doms. Imo it's probably caused by wanting to feel independent of emotional reliance of men due ot negative early experiences
--- 73135583

nah. last guy i dated was 5'6 and i realized fast that if felt super weird, i realized pretty fast he was into me being big and it made me feel weird. desu now i look for guys who are huge enough to make me feel small

>>73135527
i am fully aware most men could beat my ass, if you dont know that then youre deluding yourself. this is why all women, especially petite women, should concealed carry. dont be a moron, and dont lie about winning fights with men. this sort of overconfidence is how girls get killed. also the sort of men picking physical fights with women are not ones to brag about beating anyway
--- 73135604

Incredibly based, but I know a couple of women who are 6'0 without any boosts (I'm 6'2) and I feel bad for them. Prettiness doesn't scale well up to that height.
--- 73135617
>>73135593
Next time date a 5'6" guy who is confident and doesn't give a shit about your height.

Ngl I envy how easily women can build a bear their partner to test out different feels. To be fair I'm a bit taller than you, but you seem like you have enough options irl to not even entertain talking to a largely unknown quantity on 4chins. Do you just have a typical sub mentality, or just are young and attractive enough to be able to try different things out until you find something you really like? I'm pretty surprised how common the mentality of wanting both a large, dominant partner they can feel safe submitting to, and weak simps they can feel powerful over is among women. I guess it makes sense evolutionarily, but I see it time and time again from women who an inexperienced person would assume is dominant at first glance
--- 73135676

--- 73135831
>>73135556
i dont really know where the height thing stems from, since its not that i want to feel super independent and non reliant on men, i actually really like relying on a partner

ive had a lot of negative experiences with men, mostly just watching my mum be physically abused by them but ive also been hurt by taller men and dont like being looked down at 

i dont have a dominant mindset either when it comes to relationships, i just like social dominance and knowing i could tower over or beat most people in a fight. thats why i started working out more, despite the fact these fags dont believe ive won fights, ive won plenty. some men who are taller than me are actually scared of me due to the fact ive pushed them on their ass with barely any effort. a guy in high school id play fight with in the halls, he was taller than me and did muay thai and i threw that cunt over my shoulders

>>73135583
i weigh 77kgs

>>73135593
you could beat men up easily if you fucking worked out like i did
--- 73135872
>>73135642
>Ngl I envy how easily women can build a bear their partner to test out different feels

yeah, to be fair 5'6 man was the first man ive like officially dated but yeah i sort of do "talking, let them put their arm around me" stages a lot, enough i have a very clear idea of my tastes

>Do you just have a typical sub mentality
yeah, kinda. i think its also that whole thing of seeking out what youre missing in your regular life? like i said i have an all male friend group half of which im bigger than, im extremely tomboyish, go by a male nickname and im rather loud and socially dominant. i feel im basically treated as a man by most people i know, especially my friends, who openly say stuff like "yeah lets not invite the girls, just a chill part with friends. not anon tho, she doesnt count". so it feels nice to be sorta made to feel small and like an actual girl, if that makes sense. 

>surprised how common the mentality of wanting both a large, dominant partner they can feel safe submitting to
this is the quintessential female fantasy, something like 14 percent of women admit to having a rape fantasy, and thats just those who admit it. all female sexuality is about power and submission whether or not they admit it. true female doms are rare to the point i sometimes wonder if women who actually prefer it even exist.

>>73135831
Seems like you want to feel safe and rely on men you're attracted to, but don't want to feel trapped in that reliance due to your early experiences. 

I'd be careful about being overconfident in your fighting abilities, most guys will half ass 'fights' against women since they are coomers and because of social conditioning. Also no decent guy would fight a women unless it was a half hearted, joke fight which was really just light wrestling. All it takes is one unhinged guy to truly fight you and things could end poorly, just be careful is all I'm saying. Though I realize you also probably want a confident mindset to feel safer in approaching intimacy with men you like so I guess maintaining plausible deniability in your fighting ability relative to men isn't the worst thing ever. 

>>73135872
Yeah I sort of got that impression from you, you seem very confident, but not in an artificially constructed way, more in an organically good experiences creating natural confidence sort of way. 

That's cute, I always like girls who are openly strong but secretly sensitive. And yeah I've definitely picked up on similar sentiments. Most of the time girls who try to dominate me inevitably open up to me about their submissive side and it used to shock me a lot. I think many 'true doms' usually just have negative early experiences with men and cope by abusing weak men, which is kind of pathetic for both parties itt. I see similar parties in supposed lesbians and trannies too. 

I was raised in a pretty heavily feminist area, so I always like to think women are my equal and that this is what 'should' happen, but my real life experiences contradict this time and time again. A lot of the time most die hard feminists or 'strong' types of women are just putting up a facade due to environmental experiences, especially in their early life. Really most girls just want to feel safe, loved, and protected by someone they feel is genuinely competent and dominant in their setting
--- 73136045
>>73135872
I already thought that there are no naturally dom girls, but i wonder why are there sub guys. I'm a switch myself and my relationship right now is pretty one sided, me being the dominant part ofc. The sub bone is really unpractical, why do you think men tend to have it. I'm also bi, so maybe that's why but still curious

ty, thats a kind assessment. not sure its 100% true, but im choosing to allow myself to think so
>negative early experiences with men and cope by abusing weak men,
oof v true. im bi and have the same taste in women as men, and i feel like queer women are very often this way from my experiences. either that or it circles back to the whole feminism "how things should be" thing. i almost feel, when i speak to other women especially in fandom spaces, that some women who claim to be into submissive men are doing it performatively. hard to explain, but i almost feel like by proclaiming how much they want to edge that pretty boy till he cries theyre sort of trying to signal how much theyre not a typical woman, if that makes any sense at all? 

this is further complicated when you take into account how many of these people are transmasc to one extent or another, which adds a whole nother layer of complexity. that mixed with the ao3 and similar places sense of it almost being shameful to be "vanilla", and not wanting to get associated with snapewives type ppl, you get a weird group of young women who do not *want* to be submissive, even if that is what gets them off.

 i speak as someone who was very much one of the people im complaining abt here when i was like 14. (also sorry for late response ive been busy with my tf2 thread)
--- 73136164

--- 73136183
Height is a meme though. Sure it probably helps but to the same extent that a nice car would help you get girls. If you don't already have that magnetic pull then it doesn't help.
--- 73136229
>>73136132
I think a lot of it is wanting to fit in, conforming to what 'should' happen etc., especially for women. Ironically 'rebelling' against traditional roles is the way for women to be a part of the mainstream in many liberal areas. I think the performative women you talk about are probably having some sort of reaction formation since them getting turned on by their submissive thoughts makes them uncomfortable and like they might be alienated from the group they're accepted in. It's like how the guys who usually are the loudest homophobes are usually very gay in actuality. 

It's all pretty messy itt. I feel like I want a somewhat dominant gf or at least a switch, but I'm not sure how much of this is environmental conditioning because I have very masculine tendencies in general. I was usually scorned by the feminists in my life growing up because they could virtue signal by performatively rejecting and suppressing my masculine behavior, especially when I was a young kid who didn't know how to stand up for himself or understand that an adult could be fucked up and doing something not in my best interest. I think probably a large part of my desire for a 'dominant' gf is so I feel like I got accepted by the type of women I grew up around who so often mistreated me for not fitting their submissive 'ideals' of male behavior. Sadly it's much more difficult for men to get this sort of relationship, find out it's not all that, and return to a healthier norm than it is for women who can pretty easily 'build a bear' their partner as I pointed out earlier.

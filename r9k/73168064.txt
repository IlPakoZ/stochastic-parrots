I'm 21, white, 6' and have an okay job. 330lbs around 30% bodyfat. In the process of losing weight but it takes a while. I'm asking because I want to know if there is any point in trying to date before I get in shape.

As a morbidly obese man you are socially invisible.

Are you 30% bodyfat? 
If you have 220lbs of lean mass, while being 6'0 that would literally mean you have as much muscle as chris bumstead.

you're 21 bro stop worrying about dating and get your shit together
get healthy, get money, get your network, and get ready then go looking
i know it's a hyperbolic example but look at leo - guys can get nubile young gfs at any age if they have enough status
i'm not saying you'll get leo tier gfs but you can find a 25 year old at 33 and you're no where near that

No. Fatness is absolutely disgusting and immediately a dealbreaker to me.

I won't post a photo. I'm 30% bodyfat according to the navy method calculator. I have a very large frame though and people always guess me to be less fat then I actually am.

I have friends and I've been offered blowjobs/casual sex before. I have a friend who is the same height and weight, but he's also an indian guy who doesn't shower regularly and he pumps and dumps women all the time.

he probably used one of those electrical impedance meters. they're factory tuned for folks who are already pretty fit and as such massively undercount for anyone with BF >25% ish. the only truly accurate way to do it is with a water displacement test but that's a huge waste of money just to learn the answer "i'm fat". anyway not really his fault

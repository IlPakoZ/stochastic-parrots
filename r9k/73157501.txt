I love short guys so much. Not in a weird shota fetish way. I genuinely think they're cute and precious. I'm not into the whole "big strong man protects his smol gf" thing. Having a shorter bf who's slightly submissive and effeminate is my dream. I don't want him to be submissive in a "yes mommy" kind of way. More of a natural "I let you lead the way". I want him to feel comfortable and secure. I want to slow dance with him as he nuzzles his head into my neck. I want to be the big spoon. I want to suck his cock while gripping his hips as he squirms and bucks in pleasure. I want to kiss his forehead and rest my chin on his head. I love short guys.

>I want brutally strong , violent , aggressive dominating chad that happens to be short and puts aside his aggression and ambition only for me to guide his life to my betterment but only when convenient and easy otherwise i fall back in line when things get hard.
Did I get that right ?
That's the female fantasy in a nutshell

I'll take the bait. I'm 5'4, and aside from not looking "effeminate," I fit most of these criteria. What advice would you give me to finding women like you out in the world? Because most women just seem to think of me as a lesser person for my height and have told me I'm going to die alone since chicks don't like short guys.
--- 73157563
Pretty cool, but I think I'd want a gf that's shorter than me. Though I don't think it matters that much.

Sorry, this is a dealbreaker if it's an all-the-time thing. My penis needs to feel warmth if I am to have a good sleep. I'll accept face-to-face as a compromise.

the issue is that i dont want a girl anything like op, infact the exact opposite, but any taller girl that goes for a shorter guy is probably like op right?
--- 73157607

what if i am short but very masculine? as in hairy and with a beard. it's not even a choice since it's the only look that naturally suits me

That is the weird shota fetish way. Embrace your true inner desires
Or at least, that's what I would say if you didn't out yourself as a transsexual in every line beyond that. I wish you nothing but immense misfortune in what remains of your statistically short life.

muh masculinity is generally a cope for ugly fucks. really you can choose whether or not you want to be "masculine". just grow your beard out or shave it off, get some goofy short haircut or grow it out, become a gymcel and wear fitted clothes or stay a lanklet and wear artsy faggy shit. The reality is that you are either attractive or you aren't. Being called cute, while it obviously depends on who's saying it, generally means they find you attractive btw
--- 73157987
if you're not a tall man, straight women don't find you attractive. simple as. all else is dishonest cope from simps, women, and cucks.

>painting shotacons as pedophiles
Overused, disproven and unoriginal tactic. Try harder
--- 73158419
>>73158301
Getting off to drawings of questionably-aged boys is a slippery slope. Sure, it's technically not pedophilia on it's own, but it risks becoming worse. 
Hence why so many men/women that jack off to yuri/yaoi end up chopping their dick/tits off.

Side note: I've noticed a lot of female shotafags are perfectly fine with saying that lolifags are pedos for the same reasons that people call them pedos, which they vehemently deny. Why is this different?
--- 73158562
>>73158419
There are several reasons.
Primarily, because lolicon is unnatural. Pedophilia is, in essence, a mental disorder characterized by attraction to those too young to breed/prepubescent. This is what makes it unnatural, it is dysgenic and counters evolution.
If we extrapolate onto reality, this only applies to lolis, not shotas. Lolis cannot breed; by contrast, a shota is at his peak, his most virile.
Secondly, lolifags get off to the thought of "defiling" the loli. Their attraction is rooted in weird purity bs, and the very intent is to cause harm, because they view sex as damaging to value as men do. Shotacons (female ones only though) want the shota to be loved and cherished, they only want to make the shota happy, there is no intent of "defiling" or "ruining" or any of the other alarmingly malicious language used by male lolicons about lolis.
There is more, but those are some of the most important reasons.
--- 73158606
>>73158562
Both of these premises are false. Females experience puberty younger than males, and there is no shortage of stories of children being impregnated. Additionally, lots of lolifags are highly attracted to a concept of the pure loli whom they dote on and spoil with gifts. Ultimately, you are just another pedophile like lolifags.
--- 73158688
>>73158606
Beginning aspects of puberty != being fit to breed. Most girls cannot give birth around the time they first experience a period without massive risk.
>there is no shortage of stories of children being impregnated
Yes, but it's still not commonplace. Young girls who have sex have a much lower chance of being impregnated than an adult or even pre/teen girl. Even if that wasn't the case, it's not ideal. We know that on a biological scale, the ideal childbearing age is 23-28.
By contrast, a male's peak virility is his early teens.
>Additionally, lots of lolifags are highly attracted to a concept of the pure loli whom they dote on and spoil with gifts.
Yes, but it is still the "purity"/non "defiled" concept they are attracted to.

>a shota is at his peak, his most virile.
A pre-pubescent boy is not "virile", anon. In every other species, juviniles are not considered to be "virile", why would humanity be any different?
>there is no intent of "defiling" or "ruining" or any of the other alarmingly malicious language used by male lolicons about lolis.
Considering some of the things I've seen and heard some women talk about on that front, I have to disagree. Especially fujoshis, some of the things they write about could probably qualify as a perverse cognitohazard.
--- 73158782
>>73158694
Fujos/yaoifags are a different breed. They are mentally ill and do not represent shotacons as a whole.
>A pre-pubescent boy is not "virile", anon. In every other species, juviniles are not considered to be "virile", why would humanity be any different? 
Mid-pubescent, then. Virility is defined by drive, energy, eagerness, prowess, sexual aggression, etc, all of which teen boys are certainly at their peak of.

>Virility is defined by drive, energy, eagerness, prowess, sexual aggression, etc, all of which teen boys are certainly at their peak of.
The only one I'd say they're the peak at is energy. The rest either peak later, with sexual aggression and drive both peaking in the early-mid 20's, or the differences between ages are negligable until middle age.
Like it or not, brute physical strength is arguably the most important trait for men when it comes to mating, and that peaks in the early-mid 20s.

manlet who can't do anything?
biological limitations, social devaluation. sorry my short men.

opinion discarded, nature has provided you with a biological advantage, and social valuation is on your side. skill issue. go away.

>with sexual aggression and drive both peaking in the early-mid 20's,
Drive is proven to peak in the teens per research. Sexual aggression 10000000% teens. By the time a male hits 20 he's already a pussy due to fear of consequence and just more mellow due to lack of youthful energy. You will never find someone as sexually aggressive/"pushy" as a teenage boy. They haven't been frightened into spinelessness yet, so they're very direct and demanding, and due to their general immaturity, selfish and inconsiderate, which contributes to sexual aggression. They haven't learned to control their urges, so when their brains get activated in that sense they'll basically just keep pushing until they get what they want, very brazenly with no fear of consequence. 20+ men could never replicate this dynamic

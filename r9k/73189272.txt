Do you like your eyes, /r9k/?
--- 73189307
>>73189272 (OP)
No.
They're black like coal.
I wish i had blue eyes and blonde hair.
--- 73189321
>>73189307
Post your eye anon, black eyes can actually be rather attractive.
Personally I like my dark brown hair and hazel eyes
--- 73189324
>>73189272 (OP)
Yes. Hazel eyes. Extremely interesting colors. Kids ended up blue since both our grandparents are blues
--- 73189337
>>73189272 (OP)
No I have black bags under and over my eyes , they are the worst any human has had and nothing gets rid of them, I look like Satan
--- 73189369
Part of the reason why you guys call me "Chad".
--- 73189382
>>73189324
Post em pussssssyyyy
My eyes are like that too if you look close. Blue, green, to almost orangish closer to my pupil.
>>73189337
Some people find that attractive. I know I find it attractive when women have those.
--- 73189383
>>73189369
your eyes are ugly
--- 73189391
>>73189272 (OP)
brown eyes are so fucking ugly. i bet they were invented just for the ugliness contrast factor of blue and green eyes
--- 73189403
>>73189383
You're probably not exactly my target group though.
--- 73189407
>>73189391
My eyes change colors anon, some days they look bluish, sometimes greenish. Depends on the lighting and my mood.
I'm under a yellow light here so ofc they look more brown
--- 73189408
mine are okay they're pretty green
i really like dark eyes though
--- 73189411
>>73189382
Hand threads and eyeball threads are data mined.

There's tons of photos of me outnthere thought.

Sometimes someone reports my dick pics and it makes me so happy.
--- 73189413
Bluish green with gold in the middle, a lot like pic related.
--- 73189414
>>73189272 (OP)
Yes, but now I have a scar on my eye.
--- 73189441
>>73189408
Post emm man, green eyes are the best
>>73189411
That so? Okay, here's my hand for biometric porpoises
>>73189414
The actual Chad in the thread. Show us your cool scar
--- 73189451
>>73189441
It's not a cool scar. It's actually on my eye like the cornea and it looks cloudy.
--- 73189467
>>73189451
...still sounds kinda badass anon, not gonna lie. How did you acquire this scar?
--- 73189472
>>73189441
You are a hairy fellow :3
--- 73189494
>>73189441
no. last time i did that someone said they tasted like pistachios
--- 73189503
Fuck now I require pistachios
--- 73189535
>>73189272 (OP)
Well of course not. They are the darkest shade of brown and look like that of a rotting fish. Very unpleasant to look at. Atleast they are very hooded.
--- 73189539
>>73189472
This is true, I am indeed quite hairy.
>>73189494
Lmao they must be really green then.
I'm not jealous
--- 73189556
>>73189272 (OP)
Yes I love them, I consider my eyes elite. Pic is fuzzy but you can see theyre blue. White skin and blue eyes and dark hair is a god tier combo
--- 73189575
>>73189556
You look like empathchan if she was a male ngl brother
Just joshing ya
You got nice eyes bro
--- 73189596
>>73189575
You guys keep mentioning empath chan but I've never seen her face on here. Only fembots I'm familiar with are iris and miyo
--- 73189617
>>73189575
and honestly man, i've gotten that a lot from girls. not the empath chan thing but that my face is pretty and that i'd look good if i was a girl. i hate it, i dont like looking feminine
--- 73189620
>>73189596
Empathchan? Never heard of her (that loser)
--- 73189632
>>73189617
There's nothing wrong with having a good mix of femininity and masculinity. It doesn't mean you're a tranny or a femboy what the fuck ever, just be a pretty boy while you can. That's my plan anyway
--- 73189656
Yeah, they aight
--- 73189671
>>73189656
Nice. Very nice. You have nice eyes.
Make baby now if you are biofem yes ?
--- 73189676

--- 73189729
i've been told i have dead eyes, but i'm just sleepy.
--- 73189769
>>73189632
Yeah I know I'm not a femboy and all that trash but I feel like I only attract tween girls who like kpop or girls who want to inhabit the masculine role and expect me to be a passive and submissive guy. My last gf definitely thought she would be able to walk all over me and when she found out I was a bit of a psycho the relationship turned into complete and utter shit. She had zero respect for me. Man I truly believe overtly masculine men live life on easy mode.
--- 73189830
>>73189729
I like that look desu. Very nice eyes. Yeah you do look tired but it's that kind of thing I like.
>>73189769
If I were you I'd lean into your looks and "feminine" aspects of yourself and put all your skill points into gently manipulating women
--- 73189887
>>73189830
Wdym anon? What does leaning into the feminine aspects of myself look like?
--- 73189924
Yes my eyes are majestic.
--- 73189926
>>73189887
Skin care routines and basic hygiene basically. If you're really feeling brave put on some manscara but that's a bit of a pipeline
--- 73189932
>>73189272 (OP)
people tell me i have incel eyes
--- 73189933
>>73189272 (OP)
Not really, they don't look that nice.
--- 73189954
>>73189272 (OP)
How do people take such clear pictures of their eyes? Mine always seem so fucking blurry and shitty, I dunno how to use my phone at all I live indoors and have no use for it
--- 73189956
>>73189503
go forth! obtain thy morsels
>>73189539
never said ya were. they change color but i do wish they were darker sometimes.
--- 73189967
>>73189272 (OP)
yes and no. yes because people find them really attractive , no cause they are sensitive af sometimes. theyre hazel but more green than brown
--- 73189983
>>73189926
>TIL robots think skin care and basic hygiene are feminine and not just automatic things every single person should be doing

this is why yall niggas are struggling with women
--- 73189991
>>73189272 (OP)
My eyelids are a little asymmetrical, and I have bad vision.
--- 73189996
>>73189983
>t. Metrosexual 
Fucking fag, get out!
--- 73190028
>>73189926
I already take care of my skin. Ironically that may be why girls see my face and consider me feminine kek. Definitely not doing any faggot tier stuff like putting make up on. I guess I'll just pretty boy maxx and /fit/maxx until I'm too old
--- 73190060
>>73189719
I hate interacting with toilets tho because they just reject me and make me feel disgusting and worthless
--- 73190075
>>73189932
Not bad. Def 7+/10 eyes 
>>73189933
Hmmm I'd have to give you a 5.5/10 but could be the angle
>>73189954
Good lighting, and Snapchat focus features are way better than the default camera app.
>>73189956
Nah I am jealous lol I wish my eyes were light green
>>73189983
Lol

Girls dig a soft boy (when they're ovulating)

>>73190075
Girls dig a soft boy but other guys are hyenas and if they smell weakness they'll try and fuck with you and snatch your bitch right in front of you. Even if I look like a pretty boy, I gotta get tough somehow
--- 73190104
>>73189671
Uuuuhhhh I'm a dude but thanks.
Chicks dig my eyes and I guess men do too.
--- 73190110
I would like them on others but not on myself
my mom has very blue eyes and I feel resentfull that I didn't inherit them
I do prefer dark eyes on other people but I wish I had the same ones as my mom
--- 73190169
>>73189467
I did my best but it's really hard to see on camera.
You can see a small line looking thing in the pupil and that's the scar.
>How did you acquire this scar? 
I'm not sure. I had bad vision in the left eye for like 2 years and sudenly it just started feeling irritated and leaking tears the doctor told me the cornea had changed shape and created a scar.

Interesting. Hopefully it doesn't negatively affect you too much.
--- 73190197
>>73189272 (OP)
Don't care, cant even see them most of the time
--- 73190584
>>73189272 (OP)
>Do you like your eyes, /r9k/?
I don't know. People say that they look feminine. That is no good.
--- 73191577
I got greyish blue eyes but I think they're kind of dull and boring looking
Perhaps from an outside perspective someone else might appreciate them more than I do. 
I think even with colored eyes it doesn't really do you any favors unless they're very piercing and deeply colored
--- 73191681

Hey you're cute

I love my eyes. I've had people telling me my whole life that i have beautiful eyes. Can't complain.
--- 73191979
>>73189272 (OP)
I like the way they look but they don't effing work properly. I'd prefer functionality over attractivity ;-/
--- 73191987
>>73191734
Same, mostly girls compliment my eyes which gives me a small ego boost
--- 73192326
>>73189272 (OP)
I have pretty strong dark circles bc sinusitis, but I like them, the only issue is the fucking 3.5 astigmatism
--- 73192431
yea my eyes are great
--- 73192448
>>73192431
mine are like grey and orange with bits of light green
--- 73192511
>>73189272 (OP)
i think theyre fine, i wish i had more eyelashes. i get complimented on the color a lot for whatever reason though
--- 73192604
>>73190584
If you're >>73189729 they do look kinda feminine, but feminine traits in certain places facially isn't a bad thing
Regardless 7/10 eyes

>>73191979
Gorl
They're still nice. Big blue eyes are pretty. But due to the aforementioned functionality I will be giving you an 8/10.

>>73192431
You have a lot of pressure in your life. Kinda just look done with shit.
There's a comic that shows how you have to cling to the good in yourself otherwise you will always appear as your own most disliked form
6/10, 7/10 with practicing acceptance

>>73192511
The color is good for sure
7/10

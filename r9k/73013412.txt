I used to finger my butthole when I was 16 but then stopped a few months later. I tried again last year at age 23 and didn't get any pleasure at all. The only time where it's even remotely pleasurable is when I'm fingering and jacking off at the same time

You need to experiment to find what you like. My boyfriend is a bodybuilder who takes steroids and his prostate is xbox fucking huge to the point it fucks with his peeing if i dont milk it. 
We have an ottoman
>pic related
that i have him lie on him stomache on so he can be comfortable for a long period of time.
>i sit on his back legs and run my dick in him for extremely gentle sex or i stick my fingers in and i just barely push onto it
when i barely push onto it with my fingers his body flushes more than when i fuck it because of how sensitive his is. If i fuck him hard for instance he doesnt feel anything and its just me getting off. But if i am just running one finger gently over the prostate he will get more and more horny to the point he starts moaning and his cock will just leak a constant stream.

Should've bought a vibrating one, maybe one of those rude boys or whatever they're called, those dildos especially made for faggotry.

Also, there is a saying, something like "hunger is the best cook". Abstinence makes for the best sex. Do nofap for a week or two and you'll be cooming just staring at the dildo. Oh and drugs supposedly help as well, including stims and that smelling thing that loosens your anus whatever it's called. 

Then again, I wouldn't make this stuff a lifelong hobby, it's probably best to have a wank and move on with your day.

That's probably inflammation, not even memeing.

I don't know, maybe he should consult an urologist. I don't do steroids, but I do have chronic prostatitis and my urologist gave me pills for it (stuff containing saw palmetto as an active ingredient) and even anti-inflammatory suppositories. They are just a temporary solution though, the underlying problem has to be solved.

My problems started after I edged myself for literal weeks (not continuously obviously) without ejaculating at all. I did have a mind blowing full body long lasting orgasm when I finally came, but it also made my prostate hurt like hell for a long time.

No problem. Also, be sure to use lube. Water based is probably best from what I remember. And try to take it slow and enjoy it while watching porn or something like that. Don't slam into it like you're shooting a porno.

Also, from what I know, it's not necessarily about the prostate. There are other erogenous areas in there so just find a position and movement that works, don't insist on the prostate.

Unironically dutasteride and finasteride. Those drugs were intended for prostate growth but were repurposed for hair loss.

This is bait though. Jacking off normally should relieve the pressure.

I haven't jerked off for a month and I haven't been able to do that. Fuck.

The most intense orgasm I've ever had was riding a dildo, I almost passed out. My ass just feels really good even with a single finger, built for anal masturbation I guess

I'm starting to get really mad whenever I hear about a woman or a man having one of these mindbending orgasms. How?

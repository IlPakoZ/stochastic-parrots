I wanted to look up "Bring me to life" on /mu/, I've come to the conclusion that the song isn't -that- bad.

I spend a lot of time searching the archives.

I've noticed it goes down like every weekend over the last month. Maybe it's always been that way and I just never noticed? Whenever I need the archives most they're down.

Do people think it's bad? I think everyone was just sick of it because it was used in hundreds of thousands of awful YouTube videos back in the day.

I guess I conflated with it being bad because of how it was overused in bad youtube videos.

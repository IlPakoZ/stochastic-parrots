How do I apologize to all the guys that I've hurt?

You don't, just leave them alone.

You start by sucking my dick. That would be an adequate apology to all the men you've wronged. Including me

depends on what you mean by "hurt"

we as men just move on at some point. even something as hurtful as a breakup can feel like just another "thing" that happened in the past. if you shoot them all a random text out of no where they're probably just going to shrug it off and think "whatever"

alternatively, if someone's actively going through a bout because of you, an apology might mean everything and in that case, idk how to help you.

tbf Idek if you're talking about breakups it's just my input

You can email them anon, it is so easy to do.

You walk up to the person and say you are sorry for the thing you did wrong. If you can you should be prepared to compensate them for the harm you caused. Such as with money or labor.
If it's a lot of people then make a list and check things off My Name is Earl style. Maybe karma will be less of a bitch to you then.
If you actually do this you are on the path to being a really good person.

i've gone out of my way to apologize to 2 or 3 people that i've wronged in the past and i can honestly say i feel pretty good about it. 1 of them we just left it at that and didn't talk any more, one of them became my friend again and i feel good about that, and i think there's another i can't really remember right now

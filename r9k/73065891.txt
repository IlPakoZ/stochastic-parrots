Have you ever tried getting psychoactive over-the-counter drugs in an ordinary pharmacy? I am somehow very anxious about this, but it's my only choice. What if they don't just give it to me but ask questions?! Please help

Do you live in a third world country or any other reason you simply don't order it online?

Dude you can walk into any store in the world and buy a shit ton of DXM. No one cares. My friend and I in HS used to steal it all the time.

those psychoactives are much more dangerous than simply getting mushrooms or acid. they are not hard to obtain, so I wonder how remote of an area you must live in. theres a 100% chance of you finding those things in your closest city

Well I live with my family and I would be more than screwed if they intercept my package and this is the only way I could get it.

I am European and it isn't as easy here. Here you can get that stuff only from a pharmacy.

Well the p.o. box is an option I could look for, since I do not trust my parents at all and they def will open my package.

They will ask to show them a prescription. Or they'll ask your name and zip code to see if you have any prescriptions in their database. If the answer is no, then they'll tell you nothing came up and to leave. You can just say something like, "sorry, I'll call my doctor about it," but there is no scenario here where they'll actually give you the drugs. They always look up the prescription first and fill it using that. You'd be better off stealing from one the next time blm riots happen, or just order it online.

The drugs I want are available without prescription so that's no issue

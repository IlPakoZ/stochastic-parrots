You find each other online but you still love each other. You have plans to meetup regularly and cuddle and love each other and do fun things. It's not ideal but it's real.

I'd love to have an almost exclusively online relationship where we just meet up a few times a year. I don't think any woman would ever go for it though :(

it's expensive and real love is rare.
a lot of the time the person you're seeing will be talking to tons of people behind your back.
--- 73066052
>>73065963
Lol.
>>73065981
It depends on the place we're talking about I guess. Like with 14-year-olds and their roblox/minecraft gf's, I doubt their love, but you can absolutely meet a girl on here, reddit, some videogame, and you're both adults with at least one of you having the means to travel, and you can do so.
>>73065991
Why would you want that?
>>73066010
Talking to others behind your back meaning what? They have plans with 30 other guys to meetup?
--- 73066068
From my experience with many online friends the relationship is never as strong as it seems. I've met up with my online friends in real life, spent weeks together, and then they just ghost me out of nowhere.
--- 73066069
>>73066052
>Why would you want that?
I don't like the level of physical proximity expected in modern relationships, sharing the same bed and everything. I want to be emotionally close to someone, I don't want to be physically close all the time.
--- 73066079
>>73066052
>Talking to others behind your back meaning what?
usually checking out the market or their other options, it's hard to find someone who wants to be exclusive since LDR are a lot of effort.
--- 73066080

Long distance relationships are often looked down upon because they often don't work and are only a product of fantasies and wishful thinking.
Plus a lot of them are cringy af.
--- 73066100
>>73066052
>I doubt their love
That's the thing. Most of those are just to get by until another person in a closer place pops into their lives, especially for girls it makes a lot of sense because it is just way easier for them to get another person. People are already unreliable enough in irl relationships, why would they behave themselves when there's no way for them to get punished for their shitty behaviour?

Because if it's a relationship it's one mediated by alienation. You're not actually interacting with someone; you're interacting with symbols on your computer screen
--- 73066152

i had this relationship dynamic and don't think it was real for him. i don't think any of it was and it broke me.

I don't think this would be common if they're your gf.
>>73066069
What if your beds were separate?
>>73066079
That's definitely a danger, but if you're getting the point you want to meetup relatively soon, then I'd think you're far more likely to remain committed.
>>73066080
I understand saying they don't often work. They need a lot of effort/trust, but they definitely can work if you find the right person and you're both serious.
>>73066100
With like 14 yo's in general, I doubt their love as being much of anything real.
>>73066134
>you're interacting with symbols on your computer screen
You know you can speak over the internet? And see each other on video or pics.
>>73066152
Did you meetup IRL? What made you think that?
--- 73066183
>>73065950 (OP)
Because normies are idiots and like to gatekeeep everything, they think they are somehow superior to us because they found someone through another medium, remember how insane they were going in lockdown even tho half of them only had lockdown for a month because "wE cAn'T mEeT oUr FrIeNdS iN rEaL lIfE" because they were soo pathetic they couldn't even fucking handle a phone call, ignore what they have to say, online relationships are definitely real
--- 73066199
>>73065950 (OP)
because any time you can just stop replying to someone, or block them without saying why isn't any kind of meaningful relationship.
friendship or otherwise.

All this online bullshit isn't real, same with dating apps.
It's so you can meet them in person, without that you're not really getting to know them.
--- 73066203
>>73066174
>With like 14 yo's in general, I doubt their love as being much of anything real.
I was talking about adults. A lot of people here, including myself had experiences like that.
--- 73066206
>>73066174
>I understand saying they don't often work. They need a lot of effort/trust, but they definitely can work if you find the right person and you're both serious.
Yeah, but they're generally made fun of/ridiculed for the reasons I stated. I do believe they can work, but it's pretty rare.
So is there any point to keeping the thread up now? Question has been answered.
--- 73066224
>>73065950 (OP)
>plans to meetup
Do you have any proof? Online isn't real because you never meet anyone. There are some people here who somehow don't even have sex.
--- 73066227
>>73065950 (OP)
>have plans to

If you DO any of those things, you no longer have an online relationship. You have an LDR.

But you're never going to actually do any of those things, because you are in a fake bullshit online relationship.

That's every relationship unless you live together and/or are married.

>>73066203
Like what happened, exactly? You had plans and then she said something to the effect of "welp I found another guy, bye! &lt;3"
>>73066206
>is there any point to keeping the thread up now?
People have various answers, and I want to argue with them.
>>73066224
>Do you have any proof?
Of what? That's something that happens if you actually love each other.
>>73066227
So you just need to be move to the LDR stage? I see.
>>73066276
What if you meetup dough?
--- 73066323
>>73066294

So you are proving me right then. Online isn't even real. It's just a waste of time that avoids the possibility of love.
--- 73066344
>>73066294
>You had plans and then she said something to the effect of "welp I found another guy, bye! &lt;3"
They never treated you as seriously as you treat them. I've seen people say they encountered that a lot, although for me, it was more like they kept coming up with excuses not to meet up.
--- 73066345
>>73066323
What are you talking about? You start out online, fall in love, and then you plan to meetup.
--- 73066373
>>73066345
>falling in love with someones fake account
how many girlfriends have you had this way?
--- 73066402
>>73066344
>they kept coming up with excuses not to meet up
I think if you both don't really want to meetup ASAP then there's something wrong, if you're at the stage where you supposedly love each other.
>>73066373
>fake account
What? I've found my one true love on /r9k/.
--- 73066414
They simply require a lot of work, commitment and trust for them to work
And you can't find individuals capable of either of those around here, male or female
--- 73066423
>>73066402
>I think if you both don't really want to meetup ASAP then there's something wrong
Not sure where you're from and what kind of background you have, but I don't think it's that easy. People still need to attend class (university or college), or they have work, etc. It's not exactly cheap to travel long distances. We're not talking about bus/train rides here for the most part.
--- 73066465
They don't work, it is a stop gap and if they ever meet someone who gives them the same level of attention and lives closer it's over. If they ever meet someone online who gives them more attention it's over. I have never seen one work out. Their only hope is one person moving to the other and taking the relationship offline. So that it is no longer an online relationship. Beyond that it will end badly.
--- 73066505
>>73066344
>it was more like they kept coming up with excuses not to meet up.
Funny how these things go.
Hell, imagine being in a relationship with such a person for which you're completely providing and whose entirely financially dependant on you for survival.
t. currently stuck in this scenario
--- 73066527
>>73066414
Lots of people find love on here.
>>73066423
Let's say you're both from the U.S., the plane ride from coast to coast isn't that expensive if you really want to see each other, and there are week long breaks in uni, and usually a long summer break. With work it's probably harder to schedule but definitely still possible.
In europe it might be harder, but I think in some ways it can be easier because the public transportation is way less awful than it is in the U.S.
>>73066465
Obviously the end game is for them to move in together for any LDR, but it starts off an online relationship and just meeting each other IRL regularly.
>>73066505
Are their excuses real or is she just exploiting you and you accept it?
--- 73066542
>>73065950 (OP)

--- 73066575
>>73066527
>Lots of people find love on here.
what's the %?
her's the thing, relationships are complicated, and only very few of them work, and that rule works for REAL relationships, LDR only adds yet another layer of complication to it and I can safely say that most relationships that start 'here' don't go anywhere
two people falling in love? yeah sure, but actual relationships leading to living together and whatnot? nope, I'd be surprised if it reached higher than 2-3%
--- 73066724
>>73066575
It's obviously rare, but you can still try it and it can be amazing. It's not easy to make work but it still happens.
--- 73066737
>>73066527
My point is even you agree if it stays online it will die. You're trying to take it offline, so how can you believe that online relationships are real if they don't really start until you are actually physically together? Online is just another way to start a real, offline relationship.
--- 73066769
>>73066737
>they don't really start until you are actually physically together
That doesn't make any sense. They're completely fake until the instant you see her at the airport or whatever? There's a spectrum to how real it is, and some are dead-end scenarios where you're never going to meetup and there's little desire to, and then there's really good scenarios where you meetup pretty often due to a nice setup you two have with public transportation or something.

Anya is so adorable she makes me want to care for a child, but i know there is more to it than just japanese cartoons. I dont think i would be a good father
--- 73066802
>>73066527
>Are their excuses real or is she just exploiting you and you accept it?
The excuses are real, but they're not worth cancelling meeting each other or getting to live together, and the inconsistency of what makes an excuse worth cancelling over or not is also an important element (which adds a lot to how fake those excuses sound to me at this point) 

And there's always something new popping up, always, every single time we get rid of one of the problems, another one appears
--- 73066839
>>73065950 (OP)
cbf to read the entire thread, i do agree. those relationships may obviously come with their own problems such as potentially living thousands of kilometres apart and being able to see one another every few months only. but the warm and fuzzy feeling you experience, the longing for the other person, its all very real
--- 73066871
>>73066527
>week long breaks in uni, and usually a long summer break
It's not like everyone's holidays are the same either. One uni's breaks can be different from another, and you also might still need to work/study during those breaks, especially the summer one when you'll no doubt will have some sort of internship/project. It's not as easy as it sounds. I'm still quite curious what your background is because you should know all this.
--- 73066888
>>73066174
>What if your beds were separate?
Separate beds would be a step up from the typical modern relationship but realistically I'd want entire weeks off from time to time. Say, separate vacations. I'm not saying that fully distance relationship is my IDEAL but it's better for me than the typical modern overexposed/no breathing room relationship.
--- 73066908
>>73066802
Why do you let her exploit you, then?
>>73066871
Lol I'm literally a uni student in an LDR and my gf met up with me when we had the same spring break and we're going to spend a huge chunk of the summer break together. Obviously that won't always happen so nicely, but it obviously can still work if you both try.
--- 73066944
>>73066769
They aren't fake, it's just semantics I guess but it depends on if you mean relationships like any sort of two people communicating or romantic ones. I believe a romantic relationship is fake for as long as it isn't experienced physically and sexually. If you meet up often enough it may as well be considered an offline one. But if there are long periods between sex that causes problem even in offline relationships. If you rarely see each other to begin with it can spell disaster.
--- 73066972
>>73066944
I mean romantic relationships, and you're basically saying they're fake until you see each other at the airport or where you first meetup. I agree you should meetup as often as you realistically can and avoid long breaks if possible, though. If you just love each other, then you'll want to see each other IRL as often as possible, generally.
--- 73067008
>>73066908
>I lucked out so everyone should luck out too!
Wow, thanks, that really helped
--- 73067038
>>73067008
I didn't say that. It can work if you both really try. That's the point. There's lots of reasons it's not perfect, as you've said, but they can still work.
--- 73067051
>>73067038
I mean, the transportation part isn't even the biggest issue I mentioned.
--- 73067092

>>73067092

I don't see why you made the thread if you don't even want to discuss anything at all, although I feel this is on purpose because you have always been like this. I think I know who you are. You call this "arguing".
--- 73067142
>>73067113
I'm not here to say LDRs are perfect. If you want to argue for how they're not real, that's interesting. I can reply to some of your qualms with them, but some problems aren't feasibly fixable.
--- 73067280
>>73066174
>Did you meetup IRL? What made you think that?
yes we met in real life first. through school and other people. just how they treated me. it's why I've been single so long.

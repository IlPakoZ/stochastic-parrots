Can you have sex and still be a incel?
I think yes.
I think of inceldom like you cant find a long term relationship.
So yeah i have sex but im still a femcel because i cant find a husband(thats worth my time and not some 1/10 dusty) to put a ring on my finger.

Honestly, I never even thought about losing my virginity to a whore because it wasnt the thing I was looking for. I dont judge guys who use such services because they probably want physical sex with no strings attached whenever I want intimacy and validation (despite having AvPD).

I was an incel for most of my life and I was never even a little misogynistic. I knew I only had myself to blame. I really don't understand misogynists and other bigots.
--- 73003374
>>73003258
These traits keep repeating among incels. The society should look at this problem.
>>73003275
I think women are hated not because they dont give incels sex but because they lead to downfall of society by incel logic. Then there are people who think that pointing out women and people in general prefer looks above everything else are misogynists.

how do you guys come up with this facial rating? did you get it from someone else rating you?
I got a 3/10 rating on photofeeler with voting restricted to around 40 women before they fixed their rating system to be more lenient. now the same photo shows 5/10 rating because they fudged the numbers by adjusting weights going by people's voting history, but I prefer to stick by the original rating because it's more honest.

How are you actually an incel? I don't think you can really be an incel if you've barely ever tried to get a gf in the first place.
--- 73003885
>>73003609
>>73003809
I've been in two long distance relationships. They ended because although they wanted to come and visit me, I felt uncomfortable with them wasting their money. Basically my own self hatred ended up imploding both relationships. I feel convinced that I deeply loved them both, and I think they felt the same. Although I am very sexual and we had a great time masturbating together, I'm not sure I can stand to be touched, even though I desperately want to touch and be touched. I miss them both so much and I hope they are each living good lives.

I've asked two girls out in real life, and was rejected both times. I think I handled it ok both times, but it left me unwilling to - as I said - put myself out there.
--- 73003911
>>73003885
>I've been in two long distance relationships
So you're just a plain normalfaggot LARPing as an incel, got it. That's why I ask these questions because most of you guys are normalfags.
--- 73003935
>>73003911
I may not have been clear, when I say long distance I mean we never met up. The thought of meeting up and how I couldn't go through with it is what ended both relationships. I'm still a virgin at age 30. I have no future prospects for life, never leave the house, hate everything about myself and haven't enjoyed a moment of my life in what feels like an age. If that's "normal", I dunno what hell the rest of you are going through.

--- 73003952

Not true at all lol
--- 73003978
>>73003935
>I dunno what hell the rest of you are going through
Actual loneliness and no prospect of a gf at all. You've had multiple gf's and easily could've met up with them but you decided against it. If having multiple gf's is the experience of the average incel, then incel """suffering""" is just a meme.
>>73003947
You could talk to strangers in small ways, e.g. asking for the time and pretend you don't have your phone. Just small little things like that can get you more familiar with random interactions, and you can build it up from there.
--- 73004046
>>73003978
You think I don't go through actual loneliness? When I broke up with my previous long distance girlfriend 2 years ago, I also stopped speaking to all of my friends. The only person I ever see or talk to now is my dad, and it's been that way for years and years. In the past 5 years I've left the house maybe as many times. The dogs I grew up with and love and miss with all my heart died without me having seen for months or even years because I was so unable to deal with speaking to people or leaving the house.
--- 73004051
>>73003879
does it really count if she's married now and I'm an wizard?
--- 73004098
>>73004046
You might have some loneliness, but it's not at all like the loneliness an incel faces, and it's clearly very largely self-imposed. Like you're literally just saying "yeah I could've had 2 gf's fuck and cuddle me but I left 'em both and then I also left all my friends too...". You're nowhere near an incel, at the very least.
>>73004051
I'm not saying you should date her now but it's a surefire sign that you at least weren't at all ugly at the time, which is good now unless your looks faded greatly, which if you let that happen, then that's kind of your fault unless some disaster occurred. The main point, though, is your lack of willingness to actually try means you're not really an incel.
--- 73004113
>>73004046
i agree with the animefag, you were never an incel or a robot
--- 73004128
>>73004098
>looks faded greatly
I was a chinlet then. Now I'm a fat chinlet.
--- 73004143
>>73004098
That is some bizarre gatekeeping. I'm not lonely despite never speaking to or seeing anybody. I'm not an incel despite being a 30 year old virgin. It's just "self-imposed". It's as self-imposed as anybody else's, at some point you have to point the finger at yourself and realise you are the issue. I do, why can't you?
--- 73004146
>>73003978
I know how to talk very well, there's just no opportunity to do it
--- 73004196
>>73004128
Being fat greatly hurts your looks, especially if it affects your face, for most men, so that's definitely not good. Random girls liking you means you definitely weren't that bad-looking, also.
>>73004143
>It's as self-imposed as anybody else's
Lmfao are you trolling? Leaving 2 gf's you could've fucked or whatever pitifully easily is nowhere near similar to the way actual incels are (kind of maybe?) at fault, i.e. for their crippling self-doubt, lack of self-esteem, lack of confidence, lack of social skills, unresolved traumas, etc.
Any guy who's similar to you I'd say in an instant is nowhere close to an incel. Also, you're incredibly obviously just a volcel. Older virgins exist like you who are normalfaggots who are just volcels. That's why the label exists lol.
>>73004146
How not?
--- 73004214
>>73004196
>crippling self-doubt, lack of self-esteem, lack of confidence, lack of social skills unresolved traumas, etc.
Why do you think I didn't end up having sex with those girls?
Anyway, you could get a prostitute right now and then you wouldn't be an incel. What do you mean you won't? Oh, that's self imposed then, you volcel.
--- 73004228
>>73004196
>fat
I've been fat in my HS. No luck.
> Random girls liking you means you definitely weren't that bad-looking, also.
can it really?
--- 73004230
>>73004143
How is it not self-imposed when you had friends and girlfriends u decided to ditch?
--- 73004253
>>73004214
>Why do you think I didn't end up having sex with those girls?
Irrelevant. You can't be an incel if you've had a gf before, incredibly obviously. It doesn't matter why you shot yourself in the foot when you've had a really easy dating life so far.
>hurr durr having a gf and dumping her is the same as being able to see illegal prostitutes
No it's not even slightly similar. Inceldom normally precludes sex with men, sex without consent, or paid sex. If you want to use a different label, we can, but in any case, these situations are completely incomparable lmao.
>>73004228
>No luck
With what? Losing weight? Do you have a condition?
>can it really?
Yes, obviously, lol.
--- 73004255
>>73004230
I "ditched" them because the thought of someone touching me physically repulsed me because of childhood trauma. After that, I couldn't speak with my friends anymore. I just couldn't bring myself to chat with them or play games anymore, so I stopped. I miss it a lot, I didn't really do it out of choice.
--- 73004266
>>73004255
You did do it out of choice, though. Being scared of touch isn't an excuse to never conquer your fears, retard
--- 73004276
>>73004253
>incel
>involuntary celibate
I want to have sex, I want to have someone to love and be loved by. I couldn't bring myself to do it because I'm fucked in the head, not because I didn't want to. I desperately want to.
--- 73004296
>>73004276
You've had easy chances to have sex but didn't take them out of choice. You're a volcel. You can get another gf if you want, normalfaggot.
--- 73004306
>>73004253
I did ballooned in the uni so I have no ideas behind having looks under fat. 
>Yes, obviously, lol.
that cannot be true.
--- 73004315
>>73004296
I dunno what to say, you're a legitimate mongoloid. Maybe I could get another gf, but I probably couldn't have sex with her because, like all other incels, there's something deeply fucking wrong with me.
--- 73004340
>>73004306
>that cannot be true.
How?
>>73004315
>Maybe I could get another gf
If you've ever had a gf, you're not an incel. If you've ever been loved by any girl, then your sense of """loneliness""" is absolutely light years less bad than an incel's loneliness. The fact that you think it's pretty likely you'll get another gf shows how insanely easy you have it lmao.
You spit in the face of real incels and it's disgusting.
--- 73004351
>>73004276
Inceldom is more about being completely undesirable to the opposite sex rather than just 'not being able to have sex'. If it was just about sex then incels wouldnt exist since you can always just hire a hooker. You're not an incel because you've had multiple women love you, and you can't relate to us, now kys faggot normie
--- 73004363
>>73004340
>How?
random cannot like me.
--- 73004369
>>73004340
>The fact that you think it's pretty likely you'll get another gf shows how insanely easy you have it lmao.
Where in the name of fuck did I ever say that? I said maybe I could get one, maybe. I really, truly don't think that's likely to ever happen again, but the point was (as if I even have to spell this out) that even if I were in that situation again it would likely end the same.
>If you've ever had a gf, you're not an incel.
Stop changing definitions. It means involuntarily celibate. That's what I am. I want sex, but even when presented with the easiest opportunities, I could not go through with it, despite wanting to.
--- 73004399
>>73004369
>I said maybe I could get one, maybe
Maybe means at least somewhat likely. For an incel, they'd say "I don't think I'll ever have any girl love me in my entire life unless a literal miracle happened," not "well maybe I'll get another gf :^)".
>I really, truly don't think that's likely to ever happen again
Why? Lol. You easily got 2 gf's already.
>despite wanting to
You clearly didn't, though, obviously, otherwise you would've done so easily. You're just a volcel.
Even if you are an incel, that really shows that """incel issues""" are a meme and we should care about lonely guys instead of these weird """incels""" that easily can have sex but don't lol.
--- 73004446
>>73004399
I did want to though, I don't know how you can't understand that unless you are legitimately mentally handicapped. I already said childhood trauma stopped me from being able to touch people, do I need to fucking spell it out for you? Are you that incapable of reading between the lines? I want love, I want sex, I'm almost certain I will never be able to because of my issues. It's that simple.
--- 73004487
>>73004446
Okay so you found love very easily. Why can't you just get more comfortable around the girl with time? Even if it takes months, being sexless in a relationship for a while with a girl you love is getting more comfortable around you -- this situation any incel would take in .2 nanoseconds over their current life. If you're an incel, you suffer less than 99.99% of them in terms of loneliness/hopelessness.
--- 73004539
>>73004487
>Why can't you just get more comfortable around the girl with time?
Because they left me.

Guys what do? I am turning Europe, currently at a hot spring hotel.
Yesterday a Ukrainian girl has hit on me when I was just sitting in a hot spring just minding my own business (before you say I misread something, sitting next to me, indirectly touching my hand, and then initiating conversation is unmistakable, no person on earth could be so dense to misread it).
However I missed her after that. 
She probably liked me because I am pretty and 6ft4 but I am a total autist and do not know how to talk to women or how to behave around them. 
Should I go to the hotel bar and see if she is there? Btw. I do not drink alcohol. I am just here at the hotel to relax a bit I did not expect to meet girls here, most people are way older then me.
What do?

--- 73004688
>>73004633
Oh god you might have to go outside and risk rejection from IRL girls. I highly doubt you're ugly since that's of primary important to women who e-date, most of the time, and you already had more than success twice before. If you have no job then you shuld actually do something about it.
--- 73004725
>>73004688
I can't leave the house. I get these weird seizure sort of things, I don't know what's wrong with me there either. But yea, guess I'll just have to get over that as well as my other childhood trauma. That's how it works right? Just get over it.

--- 73004822
>>73004725
You don't just "get over it" but there are things you can do about it aside from just staring inside all day. There's no way any girl would love you if you're a permahikkiNEET unless you're very attractive, so be glad you have that, and so you could easily find another girl.
>>73004732
First 3 categories are all wrong. Robots are incels and incels don't have to hate women or be racist. Normalfags might be virgins but they're late bloomers or they just didn't fuck their past gf('s).

I'm 4/10 at absolute best. And I've tried things, I've tried medication, therapy, diet, exercise, none of it seems to work. I'm just broken.
--- 73004867
>>73004446
Same here anon.
I have insanely high physical stats, but some issues like that instantly turn you into an incel no matter what.
I used to think that it is just social skills and courage. 
But no, that does not even help either.
I became extremely good at making friends, heck I even have female friends.
And like people usually say I am extremely polite and have a great personality. I always get compliments especially from girls.
But nothing of it matters, because of deeply ingrained issues. 
While I manage to appear functional to society, however the cost of that is that the facade takes immense energy to uphold.
If I am sociable soon energy is going to run dry. And with a gf you just have to be around her for too long, and I just can not relax then it just drains and drains me until nothing is left.
Additionally I am unable to naturally initiate physical touch, like it is foreign to me. I have my own space and I am comfortable there and I can engage with the girl if she wants it, but girls require 24/7 attention, you have to constantly be thinking about her and constantly be monitoring her state and engaging with her and if you focus on anything else she will feel neglected and cause conflict.
My ex gf was like that: she always said that I behave like a very good roommate or a bestie, but I do not act like a bf.
And like when we were sleeping in the same bed I could not relax because another person was present, its just constant and horrible stress.
Women behave like they are all kind and innocent but at the end of the day you have to be the man and never ever let your frame drop, it is constant anxiety and stress with them. I would love to have a relationship where I can just be myself and enjoy the things we like together and heck I am want to help her out or listen to her and compromise but you can never get me to become a different person who just naturally revolves around the girl and so she will just feel neglected and start lashing out or worse.
--- 73004909
>>73004851
>I'm 4/10 at absolute best
What I said is still true. Many straight men are absolutely delusional as to what women actually find attractive, and I'd bet that's true in this case, because what I quoted is true. Women almost never like men with zero self-esteem unless they're considerably attractive.

But I still want a gf(in a functional way) but can not get one.
Is that not the definition of an Incel?

Come on then, tell us about your life, your loneliness, your attempts and failures to get a GF, so the rest of us can pick holes like annoying pricks and figure out why you're not an actual incel.
--- 73005139
>>73005021
>Why?
Because the given definitions are not precise. An incel can be a misogynist and racist, or he is not. And some say only virgins are incels, but others say it's only about having no gf. Then robots are usually neurodivergents and virgins, but can also have gf. And a normie who is neurotypical and had gf, but is now lonely and without friends, doesn't fit in anywhere.
--- 73005190
>>73005092
I'm a somewhat infamous avatarfag called gatekeeper-kun (other times called tranny-kun), and I'm not an incel. I just defend incels/robots and gatekeep them.
>>73005139
The way I see it, those labels have nothing necessarily tied to hating women/being racist. Incels = robots which are the opposite of normalfags. If you can have unpaid, consensual sex with your desired sex(es) (who fits certain base standards, like they're not a homeless woman trying to steal your money), then you're not an incel, and this almost always means you can get your loving gf/bf as well. I don't think robots in the colloquial sense can ever have loving partners.

>>73005190
>Incels = robots 
I came more and more to the view that there are some basic differences. Robots are people from the spectrum and not necessarily into red-pill politics, alt-right and hating women. They also don't suffer so much from having no gf, as I understood. Some are ok to live in their own world. But for incels tfw no gf is the essential thing, and being virgin is an endless source of bitterness and hate. They belong to the manosphere, nearly all, and don't necessarily have the autistic trait of living in their own world.
--- 73005357
>>73005295
How is this garbage spam? I'll post magia record girls or other anime girls the rest of the thread, though, 4U.
>>73005302
Those might be some differences in how they manifest but I think there could be incels of a type who are extremely sad due to their loneliness and for others it's more a dull pain they cope with their autistic hobbies or whatever. More robotic (autistic) incels and incels that are more hate-focused, or a mix.
--- 73005387
>>73003809
No girl has ever found me attractive.
--- 73005485
>>73003809
I have never been rejected outside from trying to pick up girls at clubs while drunk.
Though one of those might be a borderline rejection:
I picked up two girls at a bar and took them with me to another bar, but is mismanaged the mood by making out with them in the wrong order so the other one ran away. 
I basically missed the threesome two times, that was one of them. The other one was when the girl my friend had a crush on wanted to have a threesome with me and my gf, but I declined because that would have been pretty harsh towards my friend. Poor dude, we invited the girl over and he got her a gift, but she instead suggested that I make him go away and have a threesome instead. 
Its just brutal

That was my plan, to clear the mix through precise definitions. But it would need at least 24 of them to separate the types. Maybe it would be fun to do, as a kind of alternative to the lgbtq system of identification.

Those "robots" have been simping for egirls thar came here since 2008 and were trying to court girls from r9k omegle or skype groups. It's easy to say "this was a monk mode" board but actions speak louder than words. Robots have always wanted gfs so badly but coped with dunking on sex havers but actions speak louder than worlds. Incel subculture took off here because it was more honest

IMO I think the 3 types being described are making an important distinction between social inadequacy due to autism versus other social factors (like hating women)
I think those extra categories are great points and I wonder how represented they are on this board relative to incels and robots.
--- 73005644
>>73005591
I don't think your poor attempt at gatekeeping is useful, especially when you clearly lack the empathy that would make you capable of understanding robots/incels. Again, fuck off. Nobody wants you here.
--- 73005676
>>73005601
>versus other social factors (like hating women)
Hating women doesn't make you socially inadequate. Hating women for a lot of incels is just a cope when they've already been rejected by numerous women and feel hopeless.
>>73005644
Can you explain which parts of what I'm doing isn't done well with examples? I'm guessing you're just mad that I called you a normalfag or implied you were one.
--- 73005706
>>73005591
>Because you have to try to get a gf to be an incel.
Nope. Trying and getting rejected won't change that girls don't like me and never has.
Girls have never wanted me and it would not change if I got rejected by every single one of them.

>Can you explain which parts of what I'm doing isn't done well with examples?

If it was that easy nobody would have a problem. Your "advice" and your gatekeeping are both bullshit, and you should fuck off.
--- 73005727
>>73005676
>Hating women doesn't make you socially inadequate
that's a great point, ur totally right, I just was naming something as an example of a belief system that is potentially within someone's control. There are certainly other ones, and it could be argued that a shitty unlikeable personality, while not autistic, is something not really in someone's control that could make them an incel

You're a tourist with a saviour fetish, it's pathetic.
--- 73005739

Lmao fuck off, even the people who LARP as chads in this thread can better relate to incels then you do.
Kill yourself.
You are cold like a machine, you have absolutely no empathy and no compassion, you just gatekeep incels for absolutely no reason, and they certainly did not ask you to.

I wasn't really giving advice by saying you have to try. That's just obvious.

Yes and keep having normalfags with gf's, girls who've liked them in the past, etc. LARP as incels, lol.

Lemme guess, less than 10 rejections before you met your wife?
Also getting a girl you love to love you back and stuff makes your life better in almost all cases but you might still have underlying mental illness that needs treating. Seek therapy.
>>73005833
If you're all just normalfags and there are no genuine incels, then I guess that's one way things could go. I don't laugh at incels.

IDK if I just grew up around a lot of sexism and never noticed it on the board, but r9k really feels like it shifted from robot/autistic incel to conservative/misogynistic incel (even if there was some misogyny still present beforehand it feels like there is more now)
I used to like lurking to relate to ASD stuff but now i can't relate due to all the misogyny.
any similar experiences or is it just me?
--- 73005924
>>73005877
I bet you feel really clever now and laugh about those people.
your solution to incels is to tell them that they arent incels if they ever had any girl look at them, and for those for whom that didnt happen you are just denying their reality and telling them that this is not what happens normally.
You have nothing to say just go away
--- 73005945

I had 0 rejections because I never even considered asking any girl out before that. I always thought I'd get rejected anyway.

Enthusiastically talking to them, always smiling when the guy is around, just showing general interest in whatever he is doing, looking to get his attention, small gestures and mannerisms that are hard to describe, playing with their hair, wanting and trying to get physically closer to the guy, etc.
--- 73006089
>>73005988
>>I've seen what it look like when girls were attracted to other guys
>What does that look like?
Not him but they make effort to interact with the guy. I once had a girl I knew tell me that she ran over to a guy playing piano wat a club somewhere and gave him her number
I once saw a woman stand over a guy with her legs straddling his and her knee was like an inch from his groin and she was standing suggestively. 
You can use online dating as a good metric as well. If you see the kinds of conversations women have with dudes they actually like, it's clear that they want the dude to engage with them. 
When you match with a girl and she barely responds, when you cross eyes with a girl and she doesn't look at you and smile inviting, these are indicators that they are not into you. 
When women like a guy, they put effort into the interactions. If women seem like they couldn't be bothered to even spare you an inviting glance, that's how you can tell they don't actually like you. They're just using you for validation.

It's very tiresome I'm glad I have a predilection for violence and suffering pain and being physically powerful and I discovered it otherwise I'd still be a depressed and weak piece of shit. I still am depressed and I still binge eat horribly but it's better now.
Don't rely on any other person to facilitate your happiness.

But DEFINITELY don't rely on women to ever make you feel valuable or even like you deserve to he alive. Women are like soulless husks.
--- 73006138
>>73006032
Are all virgin women incels to you? Despite the fact that they could have sex with a chad in less than 30 minutes.
>>73006067
>>73006089
It's definitely true women act differently with guys they're into, but there's a spectrum to this and it depends on the context. Some girls will slut out to chad ASAP if she can, and others will just go to his vicinity and hope he makes a move on her. She might not like you the first 10 seconds you're talking but after a conversation she can talk to you more later and you can establish a rapport with her to later ask her out and there's some chance she'll go on a date with you.
I think you're seeing how women act when they're acting with 8+/10 guys and basically if you don't see that in how women interact with you, then there's no reason to ask the girl out, and I think if most guys followed this rulebook, they'd be virgins for life.
--- 73006161
>>73006032
You're right in that I'm not asexual. Yet when women do show interest in me, I play dumb and self-sabotage because I'd rather fantasize than be physically intimate with anyone IRL.
Hell I had a girl spend the night on New Years Eve, but I let her sleep in my bedroom and insisted to sleep on the couch myself, acting oblivious to her more than obvious advances.

The difference between incels and robots, is that robots hate normalfags and incels want to be normalfags.

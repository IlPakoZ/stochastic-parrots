Do smug girls that like teasing nerdy guys actually exist or is this just a meme?

They 'exist', but only in the sense of very playfully smugly teasing guys who are like the Hollywood idea of nerds - basically just chads with glasses who play vidya or read a little or something. When it comes to most regular nerds, women would mostly rather just not interact with them at all

I had a girl that talked to me like this in college. I wanted to cave her skull in every time I had to talk to her in class it wasn't cute or sexy whatsoever. One time she pretended to have a panic attack after I touched her and furiously rubbed the area I touched her with hand sanitizer and I almost wrung her neck in front of everyone in the class.

Yes, but are you actually nerdy, or do you just call yourself nerdy because of your pop culture consumption?

they wont tease you if it turns you on. they like picking targets that get extremely humiliated and preferably foaming around their mouth from being angry and unable to fight back. 
there is nothing playful about it, just malicious pack hierarchy behavior. only way to solve it is to chimp harder than they do.

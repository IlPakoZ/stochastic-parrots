who's cooler, mexicans or brazilians?

Mexicans. Brazilians are usually gross, dumber and weirder(if we're talking about the northern kind). Mexicans have lots of cartel/gang warfare and a bloody history.

Mestizo mexicans are cooler than mestizo brazillians but mulatto or pardo brazilians are cooler than all mexicans

I like Brazilians more because of Chico.

Average Brazilian looks like Chico
Average Mexican looks like Mexican Andy

Mexico has suffered from internal coups and interventions for most of its history. 
Brazilians overthrew the Portuguese and established their own empire.
In principle, the answer is obvious.

That happened in Brazil too. Mexico also called itself an Empire.

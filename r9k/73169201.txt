i dont know how people live comfortably on a $100,000 income. 
i grew up with my dad making $600-750,000 a year and i felt poor at times
--- 73169233
>>73169201 (OP)
Yeah, $600 a year is only $50 a month. Was your dad giving away dollar handjobs at McDonald's?
--- 73169245
and then landing big clients after putting in the work on the ground floor?

is this supposed to invoke sympathy? There's not a single person on this site or even on Reddit or other social media sites who isn't about to call you a spoiled brat

are you the same fag who posted about having millionaire friends as a kid?
you can only feel poor on such an income if you're spending it on retarded shit.

>>73169291

>no I just felt poor at times and it sucked
i suppose anyone would as there's always a richer man in the world. 

how was it? did you guys live in a mansion or was your dad some type of money hoarder?
--- 73169355
>>73169330
i wouldnt call it a mansion, my childhood home is only like $1.25 million and like 3500 sq ft. quite small compared to my friends. my friends had other houses. we just had a small little ski house for the winter for when we skii

my dad had a similar income but i went to a private school and lived in a typical gated community where i was considered the poor kid. just recently found out that 800k per year is actually a lot for most americans. my dad didnt really spend a lot of money on me besides schooling and figure skating and ballet so i never felt spoiled growing up.

if you are 18+ and you dont know that the average american doesnt earn six figures you are retarded which is unfortunate because rich people have the best tutors, schools, and the most time to study and learn.

>>73169783
im not rich and my parents pulled me out of school in 9th grade. i have been a shutin since then and never really cared about financial issues. theyre upper middle class.

--- 73169831
>>73169821

this explains a lot . this is a brain dead femcel thread
--- 73169846
I had switched to working two days a week still making nearly $50k a year and couldn't outspend my earnings if I tried. All this time I thought money was important but it's actually super easy to get and does pretty much nothing to improve life after you have more than enough to buy everything you could want and even stuff you don't want. I only have a few hundred thousand but I could easily see it lasting me the rest of my life. Taxes for my house are like a thousand per year. Food isn't even $4k, even with my drinking problem. Been neet the last couple years and it's a huge improvement. I want a wife and kids but women just want to be childless whores for free. I'm living the best life I can without a wife and children.
How do people spend so much?

--- 73169946
>>73169846
what's your job?

people spend so much because they live in high cost of living areas, they go out to eat every day, they go on vacations, they go to clubs, they buy a bunch of stuff they don't need like extra cars, they buy gifts for friends and family, they have a family to support

Registered Nurse. Float icu on contracts, sometimes did PCU or Medsurg when we were overstaffed. A few times ER but that's too chaotic for my tastes. "I done got bit by a bug, car wreck, I broke my finger a week ago, I lost in a gang shootout, my tummy be hurting, I drove a 4 wheeler into a telephone pole while drunk, I skipped my last two dialysis appointments/congestive heart failure why is this happening??, my nose is running from a virus gib antibiotics plox, John Doe has a heart attack, I took too much fentanyl and my junkie friends ain't be am having no narcan, I'm diabetic but fuck compliance lol lmao ketoacidosis, I'm a 12 year old kid and scared please don't start an IV on my tiny ass veins". ER is beyond fuct. 
Didn't enjoy it but it paid better than anything else I could do with a two year degree. I want a family but it seems the majority of people who get one didn't want one in the first place. I really wish money made me happier because I'd probably be doing alright in that case.
I maintained my license just in case but it would have to be pretty bad before I go back. It's a high stress job with no satisfaction. 90% of issues that bring them to a hospital they were begging for it. You patch them up and then see them again for the same thing in three months. At least farmers are doing something that matters and makes the world a better place.

I know that feeling too well. My parents are upper middle class but came from poorer families. My parents forced me to go an expensive private school because they thought that would be the best option for me, but instead of being one of the better off kids in a big public school I was one of the poorest kids surrounded by the ultra rich. I'm not even bad looking by normal standards but my self image is permanently fucked because half the kids around me had plastic surgery by the time they were 16 or 17, and not the cheap obvious stuff, but the really high end rhinoplasties and jaw surgeries that are basically undetectable. Some of the parents there were even plastic surgeons, and one guy literally got his jaw redesigned by his girlfriend's dad who is like one of the modt expensive plastic surgeons in the city. Most of the people in my grade were literally carved into the shape of models, so no matter how hard I worked out or how good my genetics were I was always doomed to be the ugly guy. The worst part is I can't even walk away from my upbringing and pretend I was always middle class because anyone who finds out where I went to school thinks I'm a rich asshole

I think Im legit fucked. I come from a low income household and going to college would be an extreme accomplishment for me. However the Pell grant I was absolutely relying on just got pulled because Daquavion Smith needed it more apparently. Without my government bucks college is financially impossible. Is there anything else I could look for to get some money for scholarships?

Just a thought for you to consider, maybe karma is real and the universe knows you're a racist asshole

If karma was real doesn't that mean niggers deserved everything that happened to them? Clearly Jews were just an extension of the universe's will when they bought a bunch of niggers and brought them over.

ask the university financial aid department. If you scored high enough on your SAT they will usually have a scholarship for you. If you have a 0 efc they should be able to find something for you if you have ok grades and aren't applying to a shitter college.

You can have your Pell Grant pulled? That's fucked up, I got a full ride to college off of mine because they gave it to me every semester.

Yeah it can get pulled if you do something stupid don't know about someone needing it more but they always say register early. I don't get full paid tuition but with the Pell grant and the scholarships has paid without much issue. I took a year off so I am worried about returned I'll need to fill out some waivers and what not now but due to medical issues I think I'll get by fine

That's not how Pell grants work. You either are below the threshold of credits or your grades are shit. What doesn't happen is you losing it because someone else is more qualified than you.

If you can't go to college on gibs, then you just have to take a loan and make sure your degree has a high ROI.
Granted this also requires you to be willing to network at any and all professional development events your school hosts. I'm talking career fairs, information sessions, networking events, etc.
Also make sure your program has some sort of co-op, internship or work study program. You have to absolutely max out your ability to wheel and deal with people that matter.

You don't even need to maintain good grades just full time enrollment. I guess if your grades are bad enough the university will just kick you out and you loose your Pell grant that way.

why do incels blame every single thing in their lives on things they can't control? being short, being bald, being autistic, none of these are things they could have changed and yet they bemoan it over and over. why don't they just focus on making up for those traits? things like NEETdom and social ineptitude are 100% fixable and would 100% increase their standards of living. are they just lazy?

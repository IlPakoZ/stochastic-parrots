Gain some weight and ill let you be my house wife, you can live off my success and we can travel and do fun shit. You need to gain weight though because you are way sexier with some thickness. I wanna rub my cock against a thick jiggly butt, not some hard bony ass.

good luck finding someone anyhow in this one life. i can't gauge your loneliness. maybe slow, with harmful roots puncturing your brain.
p.s. you look nice in that dress.

it was... interesting. decided to spend the day reading ao no flag and got a bit emotional over it. it was a good read, but some parts hit close to home. good to hear you're having a nice day. you played minecraft? what did you build?

nothing wrong with that, it makes things more impactful and enjoyable in the long run

>nothing wrong with that, it makes things more impactful and enjoyable in the long run
that's true. i ended up relating to characters i didn't think i would and it offered a lot of perspectives through them.

>I decided to switch to a beta version of the game
what's the difference?

>I can send you a pic if you wanna
sure, i'd love to see it.

inzwischen wieder gut. hab nen manga gelesen und mich von meinen affekten befreien koennen. ^^ weiss nicht, ob du das im letzten thread gelesen hast, aber ich wollte nochmal sagen, wie sehr es mich freut, dass du dich mit deinem freund getroffen hast und es so gut gelaufen ist. wie war dein wochenende?

hi, anon. 

>A constant sinking feeling
do you know where this feeling is coming from?
--- 73067505
>>73067317
>what's the difference?
it has a lot less features, it it looks a little bit different and the overall feel is different, although that may be due to nostalgia
>sure, i'd love to see it.
here you go
--- 73067576
>>73067494
my chest, i guess. it's like a general feeling of dread for the future that i can feel physically.
--- 73067800
>>73067237
>>73067576
>constant sinking feeling
I sort of feel a similar thing a lot. Not much can really do about it outside of distract oneself the best you can. 

To be frank, I don't feel very good. Was having a bit of a meltdown yesterday night, don't really know why. Managed to not hurt myself. The feeling I have constantly sometimes really gets to me, I guess. I don't know. Not in a good headspace. Gotta do homework. Thank you all again for offering company here, it helps a bit.
--- 73067876
>>73067505
>it has a lot less features
i'm all for streamlining, if it removes some clutter. hope it didn't get rid of anything you liked about the game though.

>it it looks a little bit different and the overall feel is different, although that may be due to nostalgia
nostalgia can be one hell of a drug, but it would be weird if such a long running game wouldn't adjust to modern gameplay conventions. for better or for worse. 

>here you go
thanks. it's very cute. somewhat reminds me a of a longhouse. the pumpkinheads (?) are a nice touch. did you have an inspiration?

>>73067576
i see... so nothing specific, but a vague sense of unease? does it come and go or is just... there?
--- 73068123
>>73067800
hey, prog. sorry to hear you're no well, but glad you were able to hold back. is it the feeling >>73067576 decribed or something else? 

>Gotta do homework.
well, it's somewhat of a distraction, i guess. 

>Thank you all again for offering company here, it helps a bit.
yeah. it's always nice to know you can just come here and there'll be people who have your back. hope you get out of that funk soon, prog.

Sorry to hear that
>Managed to not hurt myself.
Good work, do you think this might mean you're getting somewhat better?
>Thank you all again for offering company
You're welcome bud
 
btw I'm not sure if you've seen his post yesterday but sludge recommend you an album >>73055976 â†’

I love that webm haha :D 
>i'm all for streamlining
yupp less is more sometimes 
>it's very cute 
thank you 
>the pumpkinheads (?) are a nice touch. 
they're pumpkin lanterns, I wanted some sort of a light source to hang form the roofs
>did you have an inspiration?
not really, but I noticed my buildings look a bit like a Norwegian wooden church, I just like big roofs with roofs on top and more roofs

>How are you doing today?
Very isolated
>Any plans for today?
I went to the gym for six hours to exhaust myself as much as humanly possible, then went back to sitting in my room in darkness
>When was the last time you hurt yourself?
I guess today at the gym trying to make myself want to not breathe 
>Why did you hurt yourself?
Punishment
>Is there anything bothering you right now?
Existing. That is what all of my troubles come down to

good evening, k. 

>I went to the gym for six hours to exhaust myself as much as humanly possible
sounds grueling, but i guess that was the point. what are you doing to tire yourself out? have you ever tried horse stance? if not, give it a go. burns like hell. 

>Existing. That is what all of my troubles come down to
well, that's true for all of us, isn't it? ^^
--- 73069760
>>73069590
>what are you doing to tire yourself out? have you ever tried a horse stance?
Running for two hours with very little room for rest, planking with weights on my back for a long time, etc

I want as much pain as possible without a blade
--- 73070065
>>73069760
well, the gym is the right place for that. don't know if i could run for two hours. or do any of that stuff, i'm more of a calithenics-guy, but i do use some jump ropes and i can recommend one of those battle ropes. it's tough.
--- 73070082
i had a long post typed but it wont let me post it 
i hate myself 
gn
--- 73070220
>>73070082
all those words lost. like tears in the rain. i know that feel. maybe you can try that post again tomorrow? i'd love to read what was on your mind. don't be to hard on yourself, sludge. good night.
--- 73070348
>>73070065
I remember when I was younger I could never jump rope, no matter how long I tried. Further proving my incompetence.
--- 73070392
I used to cut myself with my nails until i eventually bled for hours before i started going to the gym, but after a year i really want to go back to some sort of cutting 
its weird
--- 73070404
>>73065468 (OP)
What was your first cutting experience?
>6th grade
>wasn't even that depressed
>see girls comparing cuts on their arm
>wanna try it
>break open pencil sharpener 
>unscrew blade
>cut my arm
It was super annoying cause I had to hide it so much. I haven't even cut in a year because my pocket knife is so dull and it barely did anything. I've never been able to cut that deep because I'm a pussy and don't have anything sharp. UGH
--- 73070593
>>73068123
>is it the feeling >>73067576 decribed or something else?
It sounds very similar. Sinking feeling that resides in my upper chest. When it's especially bad, it feels like it invades my throat and makes my throat feel tight. Mostly just an inconvenience, but given that this is 90% of what I feel, it gets to me sometimes. I've had it for five years. Thank you for asking. (:

>>73068298
>do you think this might mean you're getting somewhat better?
I couldn't say, since my self-harm patterns aren't consistent. For me to actually self-harm, I both need to feel a certain level of awful and have enough energy to do anything about it. The combination of both of these is uncommon. However, I am surprised that I managed to not self-harm yesterday, as I did have enough energy, and was actively thinking about it. I think my desire to stay put overcame my desire to do anything else.
>btw I'm not sure if you've seen his post yesterday but sludge recommend you an album
Holy crap I didn't see, thanks a ton catbro! Greatly appreciated.

>>73070082
Hey sludge, listening to the album you recommended by Downer. I really dig it, thank you a ton for the suggestion.
--- 73070912
>>73070348
depends a lot on the rope you are using. i bought some good ones and it's much easier with those. it still took me some time to learn it and the torn ligament in my left ankle isn't making it easier either. i can't do it perfect or for a long time, but i can do it well enough now. it's a fun warmup.

>>73070392
that it is. it would be better if you didn't go back to cutting, i'd say. is the pain you gain from working out not enough?

>I haven't even cut in a year
that's great, actually. i think you should keep it up. don't go back.

>I've never been able to cut that deep because I'm a pussy
you're not a pussy for not harming yourself hard enough. it's for the better that you don't. when those intrusive thoughts worm their way into your head, come here and get them out. maybe that'll help a bit. 

>>73070593
>Sinking feeling that resides in my upper chest. When it's especially bad, it feels like it invades my throat and makes my throat feel tight.
i think i know what you mean, though i don't get that often. 

>but given that this is 90% of what I feel, it gets to me sometimes.
yeah. i abuse myself emotionally until i get this weird physical response and tell myself it's feeling anything at all. don't want to do it but also don't want to let it go. 

>I've had it for five years.
that's a long time. i don't know when my depression started, but i suspect it was in my early teens and is has been eight years since indecided that something needed to be done. getting better has been an arduous path so far, but i want to believe it's worth it. 

>Thank you for asking. (:
anytime, my friend. anytime.

it's getting late and i need to go to bed. wish you all the best. good night.
--- 73071172
nothing ever gets better
anything I try is pointless 
he hates me
I failed to kill myself yet again 
being awake hurts and I can't stop crying 
there's no way I'll be able to work tomorrow and possibly the next few weeks
I'm a defective human and I don't even want to be human because existing hurts 
I'm not okay and I've never been okay but if I disappeared tomorrow no one would care anyway. 
I just don't see a point to anything
If there is a god, he's forgotten about me or I'm in hell already and one of those attempts in the past did me in

wanting male attention is selling out. or it's even self hatred to accept it because male love is poisonous.

Saying anything bad about choosing to be fat, ugly or slutty is misogyny. Just like thinking theft or murder is bad means you're racist against blacks and being against pedophilia is antisemitic. Welcome to clown world.

because pumping and dumping and making single mothers and generally ruining womens lives is not misogynistic to these clowns 

but men valuing women who make life choices by not signalling absolute loyalty to sexy men and instead being a reserved woman who is saving herself for being serious about marriage is misogynistic to these clowns

Being untattooed is like a status symbol now lol. Everybody cucked so hard to that stupid craze that now if you don't have one you look like some dignified aristocrat. In the past, not having tats was normal, and having them was white trash. Now it's like, having them is normal, and not having them makes you part of some rare nobility.
And it stands out on women even more than men because young women have the most tattoos of all.

it really is. A women under 25 that never had or doesn't want tattoos, it piques your interest, because she is not impulsive, a retarded trend seeker, can think for herself and doesn't hive mind around what her friends have or want.

I know I'm a bit socially sheltered but learning about just how much women managed to harm their self image is crazy. I'm here thinking "Do I want a girl who's never had a romantic experience or can I settle for someone who's just a virgin?" while the average person is concerned with this shit, like holy fuck

Who knows. Feminism is a contradictory and inconsistent ideology.

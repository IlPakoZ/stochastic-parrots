You have to accomplish things in life so people like you regardless of your height. People fawn over short actors all the time, because they're good looking, in shape, and star in a bunch of movies. On the scale of pros and cons, you have to completely stack the pros side so people ignore your height.

By being cool. I'm 6', I have a friend who is 5'6" in thick soled steel toe boots, he looks like a fat postal dude, I'm a khhv virgin and he pumps and dumps art hoes.

I actually got offers for blowjobs and even threesomes from girls just by hanging around my cooler friends, but I only want to have sex with my future wife who also has to be a virgin. Also he's in somewhere in Asia filming something about asian countries for National Geographic right now.

Hahaha... 6'8" - that's 'doofus' territory. Anything over 6'4" is a 'doof' if you're not built and standing bolt upright.
I'd rather be a manlet than some stooping, awkward doofus.

Now that I think about it the reason he got so much art hoe pussy is probably because he could get weed easily.

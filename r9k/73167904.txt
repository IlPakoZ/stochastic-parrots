Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.

I work one day a week helping a boomer with his computer stuff
>do you think it compliments your type? if yes, why? if no, what do you think would?
Yes I like helping people with things and showing people how things work. I also get a lot of trust and autonomy. It's also extremely low stakes, although I do wish he sold healthier and generally less evil products.
>if you had to spend the majority of your time on one single action, what would you choose?

>do you think it compliments your type?
Not without disciplined structure. My capabilities are being wasted and it furthers resentment towards life because I feel powerless to change it, even though I know it's within minel were I to feel the will to rectify story thus far. It's some disconnect between thought and doing born of prematurely evaluated uncertainty. Certainty in uncertainty, uncertainty in certainty... either you get it or you don't, scorpy have little patience for esplaining and that one of scorpy's biggest hang ups in life and instead of persevering through he take the drive thru approach of raisin roots
>if you had to spend the majority of your time on one single action, what would you choose?
idk. Answer in haste is "Make cards/games", but then I think it should be writing, and only isn't because I find it stifling to my Ne I guess, whereas card games, like MMOs or tabletop settings, tend toward kitchen sink because they are to structure play, not static narrative, so allow wider, evolving design space, as well as working with others, which might not come easy with writing, unless I'm able to cheat by saying "Directing", but that seems more reducible than the question intends
>which do you value more, luxury or productivity?
Hard to know. I *think* I thrive in luxury because it frees my mind of problems to better tackle the fun ones, but maybe the fun ones stay hobby instead of profession because they're made scary without pressure. So balance seems innately best, but I want it in the form of complimentary environmental stability

idk, do i pref luxury if I'm less productive being NEET, but don't seem to care to improve my lot without promise of meaningful productivity leading to luxury (cos again, it is really important to my admittedly shallow ass (but is it?))?
Confusing being INxP. I genuinely feel like I can survive anything, I just don't want to, unless made to feel alive. So... luxury?

The only thing it's complimenting is me wasting my time on vidya 
I really don't know what would fit my type. I don't care much either, I'd just need some stable way to make net gains on money without having to deal with too much people that I don't like
>>if you had to spend the majority of your time on one single action, what would you choose?
Working on projects, I'd tell that to the evil genie to cheat my way into learned productivity
But then I saw something about sex so now I'd rather say "spending time with my perfect gf", I think that'd be more fulfilling 
>>which do you value more, luxury or productivity?
Luxury definitely

Yep, I'm still disgusted by them, thanks for directing me to that website anon. The problem is that I still don't know who I'm meant to be attracted to. I used to say I restraigtened myself every time I interacted with a female, but meeting my cousin had the opposite effect, so it's like, I have nobody and nothing other than loneliness and to cry.

How does an ISFJ male find love?

>>73169494

I think that's just a meme/people picking on her. What about her behavior would count as leading people on anyway?
--- 73169706
>>73169564
You'd have to ask one of them, but in general I interpret it as covertly implying and giving off signs that you're interested in somebody despite having no interest in an actual relationship. An example might be flirting back when someone flirts with you, or maybe saying unprompted that you're looking for a sex partner.

Obviously 9 times out of 10 it's probably pure projection from horny INTP scrotes but that's how I understand it.

I can barely withhold blushing in any conversations or interactions where I am permitted the slightest bit of sincerity. I don't understand how people can bear being so detached throughout so much of their lives, I can see it corroding them slowly over time, their expressions becoming more plastic, ossified, unreflective. I shudder to imagine all that is lost to sick, lurking torture.

No, she's legitimately a female. I have been on voice call with her before. She's real. The "purportedly" comment was in regards to her being an INFJ. I am not sure if it's something she's claimed herself or if it's just what others have said of her, but I am and remain skeptical of that.

yes - filled with many similar personality types. problems require careful thinking and a holistic understanding of all systems.

personally - it doesn't provide any feeling of fulfillment. I am surprised that I want something that is more hands on and allows me to actually see the direct results of my labor. other people seem far more passionate than I am. I also don't enjoy how overly bureaucratic and tied down things are. it's understandable, but it's not conducive to the way I like to learn things. I like to see how I can break things to see how it works, and that doesn't work in this industry other than breaking simulators.

productivity - especially as far as myself is concerned. I don't believe myself to worthy enough of certain luxuries, and I especially don't like inflating my lifestyle expectations and making certain luxuries seemingly mandatory.
--- 73172880
>>73172822
Seems very common for INTPs to have an affinity towards minimalism and caution towards luxury.

I think this phenomenon occurs because the preference is congruent with the INTP thought process.

Places can be very different and unique to me, because I never look at them just "in the way they are". It took me years to deeply realize, that website starting pages with news or mails on them are just that, starting pages. It's similar to a whiteboard IRL with a bunch of different notes and docs on them. These websites are designed to be SELF-EXPLANATORY. The details or different designs making them feel very distinct to me, triggering very different internal responses, aren't that big of a deal at all. I was genuinely shocked at that inner realization that they are all "the same", because finally I got it, not just as an idea, but I deeply saw it in that way too. They are all just meant to be simple overviews of certain aspects. What I did instead, was creating all kinds of complex inner macro records to use these tools, leaving everyone around me confused what I was doing until all of a sudden the desired outcome appears out of this overcomplicated approach. I often don't understand something as it is meant to be. Thats probably related to inner judging functions, I often confused that with perception, because of this resulting inability to connect the dots, which ironically I often can do, so there always was this weird contradiction of being able to be very random and utterly inflexible at the same time. Another thing about these personal impressions and understandings of objects is that within this personal framework, all these details many people overlook speak a certain kind of "truth", there are resources attached to these details, in a way they are almost more real than the tool itself. It's not that deep, it's like Fi perfecting culture, because it realizes it's not just about what people think is efficient (modern housing vs tourism inducing architecture $$$). I believe I'm Ti even though I'm also attaching metaphysical/"spiritual" associations to objects (yes that's also due to intuition, but Ti/Fi in itself does attach properties as well)

If the Te user isn't dumb, then following a group rationale is a potential road to efficiency. Except in a do-or-die scenario, it's fine to re-evaluate after something goes wrong.

Te is by far the better function to use in many scenarios, because logical accuracy is time taken away from your other goals when you don't need it.

I would say roughly:
Se
Te
Ti
Ni
Si
Ne

Extrapolating from it, each function can go either way, like in such (counter-)angles:

Can be about tastes in appearances and fashion.
>Ti
>it does not lead from concrete experience back again into objective things, but always to the subjective content
https://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php/Psychological_Types (same handy source further on)
Too "ungiving" through the lens of "western social consensus" to qualify as distinctly masculine.
>Ni
Archetypes to "look through" can be appealing, handy or conductive for either of the s*xes.
>Fi
>Everything, therefore, that has been said of the introverted thinking refers equally to introverted feeling, only here everything is felt while there it was thought
You know how "western social consensus" is like about this.
>Ne
>the extraverted intuitive is continually scenting out new possibilities, which he pursues with an equal unconcern both for his own welfare and for that of others, pressing on quite heedless of human considerations, tearing down what has only just been established in his everlasting search for change
Doesn't sound strictly feminine at all.
>Te
Facts that don't care about feelings(TM).
>Fe
Can be about maintenance of coherence of fraternity.
>Si
How can you train for combat without impressions from the 5 senses?

Overall, the characteristics would be based on the person using the function, if anything.

There used to be a web series that was broadcast on TV at night on some little niche channel. Although I already knew every episode in and out, I wanted my parents to record it so I could watch it the next day, simply because this is now such an interesting artifact. Instead of just thinking same episodes hosted on another medium, I saw this as its own version of a thing (which of course is common among nerds, etc. there are tons of uploads on social media about these kinds of things).
Now I know an ISFJ who displays similar behaviors but it's on such an extreme and close minded level that I simply can't think of myself as a heavy Si user. There again lies my issue of feeling open minded and weirdly rigid at the same time.

And? Per theory of PT,* every functioning person uses every cognitive function in one way or another, with fluctuation in attitudes.
>Experience shows, again, that the orientation is largely habitual
>if the stoppage of libido was due to the failure of the thinking attitude to cope with the demands of outward adaptation, and if the unconscious feeling function is activated by regression, there is only a feeling attitude towards the inner world. This may be sufficient at first, but in the long run it will cease to be adequate, and the thinking function will have to be enlisted too, just as the reverse was necessary when dealing with the outer world. Thus a complete orientation towards the inner world becomes necessary until such time as inner adaptation is attained. Once the adaptation is achieved, progression can begin again.

Do you want to continue with your reasoning and claim that nobody thinks, feels, senses nor intuits, because... these processes are within everyone functional?

*and I've yet to see it to not apply to information coming from compilations of brain imaging studies that have definitions and concepts unrelated to flows of Jung's works. Maybe aside from imagination and aphantasia... Imagination is the only legit coggy function then, I guess?

Are you retarded? My point was about Se users definitely respecting impressions from their five senses. The reasoning does not follow.

You implied here >>73173434 that Si users have an exclusive command over impressions from the five sense.

When I called you out on that, you responded by saying that the "manual" said so. I disagreed with the "manual" and then you brought up Jung.

I made an observational claim, and you had no logical response to it. All you did was say that some expert said so. That argument is so dumb that people have a name for it - the "appeal to authority fallacy".

If all you can do is repeat what someone else says, there is no point in you studying MBTI. All your thoughts in this discussion are worthless because all you can do is deflect points.

This one?:
>Se users definitely respecting impressions from their five senses
"Definitely" by what definitions that you can present here? "Se" users don't hinge on innervations or other synonyms to impressions,
>It is, however, only concrete, sensuously perceived objects or processes which excite sensations in the extraverted attitude
unlike "Si" users.

Yes, you presented expressions personal beliefs without anything else, which is as irrelevant to any argumentation whatsoever as it could ever be. Why get defensive over me being okay with your beliefs being beliefs? >>73173738

What do you mean by "then," exactly? Whom do you think had written PT that I had been bringing linked quotes from since the first post ITT?

--- 73174882
>>73174606
Jung's works are based off of observational claims and personal beliefs as well. The way to evaluate it is to analyse the logical consistency, which you rejected from the get-go.

>>73173218
I'm not sure that there is a correct answer to this in the sense that you were seeking, but in practice I have most often seen thinking associated with animus and feeling with anima, followed by sensing and intuition, respectively. So from that a tentative answer might be, in order: thinking, sensing, intuition, feeling. 

As an aside, I would say that this, as with the functions themselves, would depend upon where one is within the individuation process, which at some stage may entail dissolving the psychological essence and autonomy of the masculine-feminine opposition, but that is a delicate topic perhaps.
--- 73175463
>>73166367 
>that would be awsome
Ok! If you wanted I think one good way to go might be, in order:
1. Man and His Symbols
2. Symbols of Transformation
3. Psychological Types
4. Aion
5. The Red Book
I believe that could give you a very good grasp and wouldn't completely overload you. You could even post your thoughts or questions here as you go, to help absorb them. I would also add that, in my opinion, it isn't always necessary to read things exhaustively to understand them, and you should take your time and only continue if you are enjoying it and feel you are getting something from it.
>>73174906
Yes, I think that's a good principle, at least, I don't think it's good to be having or displaying the same feelings all the time, and I couldn't do so if I wanted to. I suppose what I meant to originally convey was how much people detach from themselves in order to play a desired role, to the point that it becomes automatic and unreflective, where there is so little life left underneath the scar tissue. 

That's OK, I have some things to catch up on myself, but I hope we can do more soon.

Depends on just how young you mean. Teens are plenty old enough. I think that by the time I was 7, I would have had some amount of interest in MBTI had I been exposed to it, though my interest wouldn't have been great and I'd have had trouble understanding much of it. By the time you get to 11 or 12, my relationship to MBTI would be similar to how it is as an adult and I'd have a lot of fun reading websites like PDB. You'd have to go all the way back to age six probably for me to have zero interest in MBTI and zero comprehension of it.

I think it's better for XNTX-X types (except maybe INTX-Ts unless they're okay with being in the same position forever)! ^w^7 I imagine INFJ-T would be better suited for design jobs that are more humanitarian and more artistic, have more visibility, and have better opportunities for personal advancement and improvement! :3c

Hmmm.
I can and sometimes do give (very) basic haircuts. I can make a leap of logic and say my "love language" has a physical care (physical touch? act of service? which/both?) side to it, because I like giving haircuts (among other things). I enjoyed imagining cutting my partner's hair, and smooching their hair at the end.

Is the reason you blush because of the feelings you get from knowing what you say unquestionably belongs to you from the heart, or because the feeling from being permitted isn't often?

My silliness increases as I become more sincere with people, I don't really blush. As if I'm happily and unashamedly channeling some sort of inner child who can tell his thoughts, desires and observations as they are, while having fun with being sincere like that.

I say I must be addicted to Zeds because I feel the withdrawal effects, so to say, from staying up so late. Things that make me feel down right now aren't the cause of lost sleep, however. These days I play vidya with some friends before going to sleep.

When reading this question earlier, I remembered it as "what would you do if you were isolated on an island forever", for some reason

>which do you value more, luxury or productivity?
I am unsure what exactly this question is intended to ask.. 
I guess, I want to be someone who produces, rather than consumes, latter being something which I would more so associate with luxury, as consumption feeds on what is, and and production nourishes on what could become or something like that

>You could even post your thoughts or questions here as you go
I would like to skip from the first chapter of "approaching the unconscious" to the third one of "the process of individuation", the latter describing the harmonization of the conscious and unconscious, (I think), because that subject is of most importance to me
Recently, I jokingly remarked on how whenever I intent do do something, or refrain from doing something, I often end up doing the near complete opposite, and it made me think of the different tugs and pulls in my inner world, which is something I have been contemplating for a long while 
I feel like I have the "grasp" on what I *should do* do achieve what I want, yet a tremendous amount of actions I perform go almost directly against that, making me wonder why that is
I have awareness about matters of conscious and subconsciousness, which I picked up whenever sometime, but its nothing concrete
W-wait I was going somewhere with this.. I had more thoughts.. deeper insight.
I am getting enabled to ingest poison because I lent money.. q.q[/spoiler

Okay okay of course I messed up my post and all.. 
>>73175463
What I meant to ask is, does it matter if I dont read Man and His Symbols in chronological order and skip from chapter one to three?
I mean, the order of chapters has to have a reason behind after all.. but I want to get to the meat of the interplay of the conscious and subconsciousness, and the means of uniting them, as Jungs main messages seems to be the following: 
"The Process of Individuation,
describes the process by which the conscious and the unconscious
within an individual learn to know, respect, and accommodate one
another. In a certain sense this chapter contains not only the crux of
the whole book, but perhaps the essence of Jung's philosophy of life:
Man becomes whole, integrated, calm, fertile, and happy when (and
only when) the process of individuation is complete , when the conscious and the unconscious have learned to live at peace and to complement one another."

I don't actually post all that much anymore.
>What does this say about you?
Mainly that I have a short emotional memory. Even if I find something unpleasant on a frequent basis, I'll go back to it after a good night's sleep once the emotion's drained, hoping for something different and better the next time around. If I'm to abandon something completely, it has to be awful almost all the time with nothing to breadcrumb me, ie the way I was able to eventually leave /adv/.

without clarifying that it was only parts of 4chan. I understand that you were being hyperbolic, which is typical of F types, but what you said is pretty close to saying 4chan is all bad since you lumped it as one and didn't specify which parts were or were not like the insane asylum from 12 monke. 

>Even if I find something unpleasant on a frequent basis, I'll go back to it after a good night's sleep once the emotion's drained, hoping for something different and better the next time around.
This isn't meant to be a personal attack, but this is foolish. If something is unpleasant time and time again (you said frequently), then going back again and again hoping it changes is like a victim who stays with her abuser thinking and hoping he is going to change one of these days even though he doesn't It's dumb and broken. You're not really thinking things through very well.

Sorry for the unclear communication then. For /mbti/ specifically, there's a lot of sweet and intelligent people and a good amount of interesting discussion, but a fairly large-ish minority of 10-20 percent that are hateful and poison the well. So it's a good enough community for me to continue lurking, but high-risk enough that I find it best to avoid posting much in order to avoid the line of fire.

>then going back again and again hoping it changes is like a victim who stays with her abuser thinking and hoping he is going to change one of these days even though he doesn't
Seems like something I would do, I've forgiven multiple toxic and abusive people in the past for repeated terrible behavior. It's a combination of seeing the person they could potentially become in a more idealized version of themselves, forgiving flaws and accentuating redeeming qualities a little bit too much, and as mentioned having trouble holding on to negative feelings for very long. I'm probably not as bad as I'm making myself out to be, though - I do have basic self-protection instincts and I do distance myself from people and groups eventually, just at a slower rate than I should.

>In a later edit, Robbins added more detail to his story. He claimed the child who rang his doorbell was a little girl who was looking for her kitten. In the new edit of the post, Robbins admits that he was "impatient" and was "just playing," but that "it really is a bad idea for kids roaming around ringing doorbells."

>This is not 1972," the latest edit reads. "If that brat rings my doorbell again tomorrow, I will call the police. take notes." Robbins added that he "warned" the little girl he "might pull her hair" if she rang his doorbell again, which led to her "crying." The meteorologist called the incident a "learning opportunity" for the little girl.

This has been my observation as well. It seems paradoxical since Fe is the more social of the two, but time and time again I've never seen someone care so much about their social image quite like Fi Doms do. Their image is everything to them.
--- 73183885
Because our image isn't just clothes we wear, it's us, or that's how it feels to Fi because Fi is always Fi, even if it expresses otherwise to navigate Fe expectations. The same attachment you have for Ti is how Fi users feel about their Fi identity.

--- 73184108
I just see it as undeniable phenomena. In order to be a self you must distinguish yourself from others. Doing so limits the number of others you will interact with, which is why the Je user is likely to suppress Ji because it reveals Je to be a minefield instead of utopia. Balance is brought through maturation where one's Je skills help their Ji express, or the Ji user refines their Ji approach to thrive in minefield.

The first appears to be a common joke about Fi suicides, and should therefore be taken as such. What makes you think they are crazy? And how are they collapsing Ji pillars? Where is the pillar? Where is the collapse?

The second appears to be someone calling out how Fi talks a big game about authenticity but yet will cave to external influences and social pressure. Personally, I think that take is crude and misses the nuance of how someone can value something but not be strong enough to practice it. It's still valued whether it's practiced or not, but perhaps we could say it's valued less if it's not practiced? Either way, how is that poster crazed? How are they collapsing Ji pillars?

What do you mean uphold Je in order to not self sabotage? Isn't upholding something contrary to who you are self sabotage? Or do you mean they erode themselves in order to not be . . . eroded? I'm not sure I follow you.

Also, can this "Je" be a case where it is more or greater than the sum of its parts? If it is comprised of individuals, would it have emergent qualities you'd not otherwise observe from an individual alone?

Well, that's exactly my point. They don't know what the poster meant. That's not the problem.

Intents and results don't stop being intents and results. I don't know where you're getting that from. The point is that you can test a cake for its result according to metrics, but you can't test a poster's joke in the same way. The only metrics is how someone "feels" about the joke. You can't, for instance, measure the dryness of a joke the same way you can measure the dryness of a cake.

I'd guess that Fi types care more specifically about being misunderstood, whereas Fe users just have a more general aversion to being disliked (though both groups dislike both things, social rejection is painful for most not on the schizotypal spectrum, and even some of them aren't exempt).

>>73183670
Homuanon feels kind of sad. Centaur seems to have a gray existence. INFJ-A probably used to be more plainly sad once upon a time, but the sentiment was probably buried and calcified and is inaccessible on most days. Turbie seems to have a hidden sadness that would be detectable even if he didn't explicitly mention here and there having depression. Apollo, Mosley, and pumpkin are pretty open about having depression issues. I could see Polack having some kind of depression, dysthymia at least, though it's unclear. Senpai seems fine in the present, though she still seemed kind of depressed when she started posting in '20 based off a few posts I remember. firmament and Megumin seem fine.

>Is the reason you blush because of the feelings you get from knowing what you say unquestionably belongs to you from the heart, or because the feeling from being permitted isn't often?
I suppose it is a little bit of both, along with a general unconscious sensitivity to things, at least whatever can be perceived, thought, felt, remembered, or anything else; the reasons in a given situation are perhaps too nuanced to articulate. Some people, perhaps mercifully, do not have this, others I think turn against themselves and programmatically amputate it over time.

Yes, I think it should be fine to skip the second chapter, the chapters of that book are actually more like self-contained essays. It's more accessible, but I found it no less insightful than any of his other works. I do recommend the first chapter, though. I think it is good to start with the centrality of symbols, as keys to reconciliation in emotional life, sources of hidden power, unifiers of the disparate elements of the psyche, etc. Naturally it can't quite be put into words, but if you get this I hope the rest may fall into place. I look forward to hearing any thoughts you have.

I am sorry you experienced that.

>I'd guess that Fi types care more specifically about being misunderstood, whereas Fe users just have a more general aversion to being disliked (though both groups dislike both things, social rejection is painful for most not on the schizotypal spectrum, and even some of them aren't exempt).
Hmm, I can see this. Fi identity is at stake if they are misunderstood but not so much if they are understood; whereas with Fe it's social enmeshment and inclusion that is at stake if they are disliked, but not so much if they are misunderstood and still accepted/included. 

But these are all general statements discussing functions kind of in a vacuum and don't take into account all the other factors at play. Speaking as aux Fe, I don't really care about inclusion or being liked by people who don't matter to me, but yet one of my core traumas is being misinterpreted -- and that trauma can be triggered by the randiest of randoms who don't mean nothing at all to me. So none of this Fi= this or Fe= that stuff is a hard and fast rule I don't think. They're just more like suggestions

My experience with them. They are busy with their own emotions, not much about the global situation. That's probably the Fi. INFJs feel much more global. Personal happiness is not enough, the world shall be happy. Or personal doom is not enough, then they become terrorists or so. I can't imagine an INFP to be a terrorist.

>>what do you do for work?
I'm a software developer, currently the most senior dev we have.
But I'll take a sabbatical next year for 6-12 months to go do stuff and just have enough free time to catch up on movies, shows, games, books etc.
I've got enough money saved up that I could easily sustain myself for 3 years. 4 if I'm trying harder to save money.
After that I want to work just 75%.

>>do you think it compliments your type? if yes, why?
I'm not sure if it compliments it, but having an easy time being friendly and connecting with people makes it easier to talk about bugs and features. Or teaching new employees the ropes. I think I generally am pretty good at thinking of how the code I write can impact things. I might take longer than others, but I think things through properly and rarely produce any bugs.

>>if you had to spend the majority of your time on one single action, what would you choose?
I'm not sure if I'm understanding this question correctly, ANY action?
Being intimate with a partner.

>>which do you value more, luxury or productivity?
Productivity.

>>73173182
nyes

>>73182906
Yeah, but generally only when a person is egoistical in some form. Though egoism can take many forms like entitlement, racism, misogyny etc. I definitely notice that when I've slept bad, I'm more easily irritated and less reasonable.
I might have said this before, but I think egoism is the core of everything wrong when it comes to humans.

Anyway, I think it's a bit weird that people keeping naming me, as if I'm an actual regular. Even twice in this thread. I really don't post that often.

It's one of those things where it should compliment but doesn't due to the world we live in. In an ideal world, maybe. I hope we get there in the future, but as of now people are too focused on products and marketing. Creativity has been marketed into the ground, so life as a creative isn't about following passion anymore, it's about following profit. It's soul crushing.

>if you had to spend the majority of your time on one single action, what would you choose?
Anymore I just want to live in a harem and be the centerpiece. It reminds me of mass effect a little where you're Shepard going around the ship checking in with your crew. Like that but with my multiple girlfriends and I could come out of my shell and embrace my hidden leadership qualities. 

>which do you value more, luxury or productivity?
Luxury. What is productivity good for unless it produces more luxury? Luxury is the ends, productivity is the means. Life is about cultivating the sensual experience and we all just want to feel good. To feel pleasure and feel as if king in our own personal kingdom.

^^^^this. I was in digital design before I became disillusioned with the field. I was sold an idea that wasn't reality. Even went to school for two years and got a degree. It's like this, working with clients is soul crushing because they are rarely satisfied. They tell you what they want, you do it, and when they see it they're all like "that's not what I had in mind. Do it like this instead." What's worse than that is typically you will create multiple drafts of a thing, rarely just one. And there will be one you really enjoyed making. The one you spent most of your time on and the one you know in your hearts is best. But they will want the worst one. The one you made quickly. The formulaic one. Nothing is more disheartening to a creative than that, where your creation, the offspring of your heart and soul, is totally "meh" in their eyes and the client goes with something which meant nothing to you.

I assume you mean me, the creative INFP. Well, it's like this. Only a high value make would be able to attract and keep a bevy of women all vying for your attention and affections. Think about how worthy you must be for that to happen. So desirable and sexually powerful that you can have multiple beautiful women at your beck and call. And they would never leave you because there can be no better. Can you imagine anything more validating than that?

No. There is something nice about the "exactness" of things working or not and the shitstorm puzzle of trying to deliver some sales guy promises without it all collapsing in the real world. There's also long periods of time where I'm on a site completely alone and just tending to tasks in my own way and at my own pace. But the majority is just too many hands in the pot and everyone forgetting all the little details. There is without fail something that goes wrong everyday. Usually little, but every single day is less than ideal. Mostly though, I'm not great at working with my body. I get hurt in someway everyday and I'm not as fast as the people around me. Watching people who have worked with their hands their whole life is something to behold. I wouldn't say I'm bored or unchallenged but just disenchanted with the trades. It doesn't play to my strengths.
>if you had to spend the majority of your time on one single action, what would you choose?
Drinking, but I'm 3 years sober. 
>which do you value more, luxury or productivity?
I don't like the way that's phrased but luxury if I had to choose. I think it's something closer to "free time" which is literally the most valuable thing you have. Unregulated, unbothered time is a treasure.

I am not far into it, just been through the introduction and some pages of the first chapter, but it captures my attention a lot
Thats because I often rumor on why I am in the situation I am, I feel like I have a conscious grasp on what I should be doing, on what I need to do, to get where I want to be, but yet, I dont do them, and why is that?
Its been half a decade in this state, something approximating.. confusion perhaps?
Trying to pinpoint the reasons for it seems both obvious, surface level, and incomprehensible and illusive at the same time, and it makes me think of the concept of cognitive dissonance, in the context of a split between consciousness and the subconscious
Furthering on this, often when I set my mind out to do something (the conscious), my actions tend to be nearly the exact opposite of that (the subconscious rebelling)
So I really hope reading up on this will spark up on something I have been dark on, getting to know the thing I didnt know I didnt know
The latter seeming to be the thing where you dont want to look, but that just is where exactly you have to look, the monster you dont want to face

That's a good one. I'll have to use that if my gf ever catches me with another woman. "But babe, I just didn't want her to feel excluded from my cock."

Yeah well, she's just gonna have to learn to overcome her intrinsic Fi selfishness and learn how to share with the tribe aka team Harem. Spreading my love is for the greater overall Je goodness after all. Would she really collapse roof to spite wall?

Because aside from Prince and our friends (who rarely browse /r9k/ if ever and are trustworthy irls and/or longtimes who wouldn't..be commenting on this stuff without us knowing...) there are like 3 people I have called with. I mean. Okay I'm trying to make this simple but I don't want homie to feel excluded from friend category lol but 2 or 3 outside friends depending on if homie identifies with friend or regular category more jej. And then there's like one other person who *may* have heard my voice when we were all watching a movie together. But. The strange protectiveness of INFJ type, being concerned with what kind of person I may think I am because of the possible thinking he thinks he knows who I think I am, then stepping in to try to gain control of the narrative

Could be wrong, but
There's ALSO [advantage I won't allow him opportunity to commandeer]

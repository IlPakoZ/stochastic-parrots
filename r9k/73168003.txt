The paranoid bitch still hasn't accepted the request on the other site after she blocked my access to her profile on there earlier for no reason, incredible lol. What petty and toxic bullshit on her part, really.

She'll never seek therapy for this bipolar-paranoid shit on her own and will just continue to grow worse over time... Technically not really my problem i guess, but it's still tragic to observe because it's all so incredibly needless. 

She's just been trashing the relationshit for the sake of trashing it and then gleefully watching the damage she's done after the fact. 

We actually had a decent thing going and she proceeded to fuck it up for no real discernible reason there. Didn't even take her two weeks/a full month after we met up again to pull this bullshit. I somehow had a hunch she'd end up doing this though, one of the reasons i documented everything w/considerable accuracy.

I *really* don't feel like waiting another 24 hours for her to make up her mind either, since i've only been getting these types of bullshit responses (low-effort one-liners in writing and paranoia + nervous breakdowns while on call) from her at this point now. 

Main thing is that i want her to TELL ME if she's breaking up or not rather than beating around the bush like she's been doing in the past, that's the decent thing to do at least. It's quite likely that i'll get this shit out of the way before wednesday/in a couple hours even.

Literally no reason to make it drag out any longer than it has to, better to lessen the damage she's needlessly inflicted in a preemptive manner here.

Alright, truth be told the fact that she's been having fertility issues might have played a big part in driving her behaviour too. Said "she was feeling guilty about not getting pregnant" but in truth her subconscious was screaming at her to monkeybranch to the next guy after not getting pregnant immediately, which she's been doing now. 

I was gambling on her getting pregnant, and if she had gotten preggers then things would look VERY different now most likely. Ah well, cannot be helped i guess

Just reposting on this cloudy Tuesday morning with a few tweaks

May the 1st treat you right, 
With brighter mornings
And a shorter night. 

May the 10th make it good, 
On the promises made
Just like it should. 

May the 15th give no cause, 
To look back 
At long-closed doors. 

May the 23rd be so kind, 
To the faces with smiles 
That they lined. 

May the 31st feel fulfilled, 
About the days 
And hours and minutes killed.

Due to the increasing number of foreigners complaining about how much the coronation is going to cost it has been moved to to the local job centre

Thoughts on Primark?

I like it because it's so damn cheap. And the clothes are fine I think. They look fine and they last a while. I had some Next jeans and they lasted no longer than my Primark jeans before ripping, despite costing at least 3 times as much.

The downside is the closest one to me is a while away. I could try Matalan which is closer but I dunno, Matalan looks a bit shit to me.

My gold-digging bitch showed her true colors earlier again, kek 

... Was bitching about me supposedly """making false promises""" to her or whatever, and i gave her a little reality check in response (life isn't a perfect fairy tale, you're not a princess, you won't run into the perfect alpha Ubergigachad with a ready-made house and what have you straight away and have to actually sit your hoe ass down and INVEST yourself too, only then may good things grow from the relationshit given enough time). 

Really sickening bullshit she's pulled in the last two weeks/since april 18th overall though - Especially the way she's deliberately damaged and trashed the whole relationshit for no reason when things were going just fine before she started chimping out again due to her own mental health and fertility issues.

Bizarrely enough she also proposed to "freeze the relationship" until i've got the other stuff taken care of. Told her that that's fucking nonsense since she might meet another dude or i might meet another lass in the meantime, and that we either have a committed relationshit going or not. Also left the option of being fuckbuddies/FWB's open to her, it vaguely sounded like she'd be receptive to that too from the vibes i got in her sparse and overall disjointed/incoherent written responses since saturday. 

Gonna check back one last time tomorrow at noon and told her as much too, but i don't expect anything from it. In fact i'm just about ready to wish her roasty ass a nice life and good luck in finding a rich guy (which she's apparently looking for) that's going to put up with all of her shit, especially with her SMV about to hit rock bottom in the coming years.

AWALT bros, AWALT... If a non-ugly bitch still remains single after hitting 30 then there's a fucking reason for other guys having dodged her and not having put a ring on her yet. Always keep this in mind me laddies.

Soon as her vaxxmaxxed parents she's leeching off of/is living at die the bitch will have no options left whatsoever

She'll end up as an AIDS-ridden cat-hoarding prostitute if she keeps this entitled and unrealistic attitude of hers up, lmao

Like bitch, you're not even a stacy lite and your genetics are less than stellar. All those moles aren't doing you any favours either. Your SMV is fucking tanking right now and keeps getting lower with each day, no amount of cope may change this.

I'm not offering her a bad deal, not at all. If she thinks she can hold out for some random Gigachad to pick her roasty ass up she's in for a bad surprise and rude awakening. 

I can totally see now why looksmaxxed men go for young fertile women in their early 20's exclusively. These 30+ women, no matter where they're from, are all sheltered and entitled as fuck and need a reality check (they always find someone else to blame for their own misery and NEVER take responsibility for it either, like my own bitch just demonstrated to me). 

That is the only way they may learn from their own fuckups and piss-poor decision making in life.

What's it like having long fingers? I have horrible short ones that make me feel terribly insecure. They're not fat, just short
--- 73179556
>>73179511
It's alright, never known any different desu. I can reach things more easily but I am quite tall so it's all proportionate for the most part. I'd say short fingers are more fem and long ones are more masculine but depends on the individual though.

I don't think I've ever looked at a strangers fingers while out in public. Face, clothes, hair, and general body shape yeah, but fingers? Nope, not even hands unless they are wearing bright nail polish or something. You're worried for no reason lad.
--- 73179847
>>73179798
I know. I look for things to be insecure about. It's a strange one, because I love the way I look usually. Hmph
--- 73179867
Are Wald and Wankrupt's videos proofs that White people are more "exotic" than non-whites now. I mean, if a random black guy from Africa went to London or Paris and walked around nobody would bat an eyelid but Bald goes to any third world country and gets followed around and stared at like an alien by the locals. Kind of makes sense when you remember White Europeans only make up 7% of the global population.

Ahh sorry LSFPL didn't see this. I got the WiFi router working fine it's just a few devices won't connect that's all. I'm pretty sure I know what I need to do but it can wait until tomorrow.
--- 73180260
>>73180224
No worries chap, hope it all goes alright. Configuring wireless devices on a network is something I do at work sometimes because we use MAC filtering for security on our private Wi-Fi. But generally just setting up a home one is fairly straight forward I reckon. You got this.
--- 73180306
>>73180186
Ugh
Foiled again...
--- 73180312
>>73180260

I think the issue is that some devices won't connect on a 5 GHz frequency. Apparently, all I need to do is go into the admin settings of the hub and switch it to 2.4 GHz and the devices should connect without an issue. We shall see tomorrow.
--- 73180347
>>73180312
Yeah sounds about right lad. 5 GHz and even 6 are usually quicker but 2.4 spreads further and can penetrate through walls so you're safer going with that just in case. Also that's a very cute Asian girl.

My current guesstimate on the relationshit being saved by morphing into FWB-like mode is about 25-30% max overall, probably less

I went all-out again now and pulled out all the stops today, but it's extremely fucking questionable that this will have been enough considering the amount of emotional uncoupling and stonewalling she's pulled off within the past two weeks 

If she's monkeybranched on me already with some rando Chad from her home cunt who's going to pump and dump her (the most likely scenario imo and one of the only plausible explanations for her behaviour) then it's -100% 

Gonna take a shitton of new lessons and experiences about femoid bullshittery out of this either way thoughbeit. They really are all the same fucking exact gold-digging bitches beneath the thin surface, lol 

Should probably try to liftmaxx or sommet i'm thinking, looksmaxxing decreases the chances of this exact type of shit occuring in any given relationshit

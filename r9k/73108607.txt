>gain leverage over someone
You can't fuck with someone who doesn't give a fuck, but is crazy enough to kill you if you actually lay a hand on them.

how would i hurt myself, 
i'm not coming from the perspective of caring about them,
it's just proper punishment and potential labor

>>73108675
they are pretty arent they
--- 73108701
>>73108683
unexpected question, no they aren't
if anything i am the pretty one
what made you ask this?
--- 73108708
that's actually a fascinating question. I've met a few of these people. some really care about family, usually the men. The girls? you need to be in their presence only because you work with them, and don't show you care about them. be kind of bitchy, and just wait.

that's all I got

Join a three letter agency and manipulate chuds into becoming controlled opposition for globohomo.

>>73108713
i've considered it but my personal agendas have greater order of magnitudes than any of them, so it wouldn't be efficient
--- 73108728
>>73108701
were they always like this, i mean, when you started really caring about him, was he already like that?
--- 73108754
>>73108728
you're cute with your adamant idea i care,
but yeah, they were always like that
--- 73108790
>>73108754
you can take the man out of the chud, but you can't take the chud out of the man
--- 73108861
>>73108790
where did you get that from,
it seems solid enough to have adversarial evidence
--- 73108906
>>73108861
you can take the man out of the incel but you can't take the incel out of the man

this popped into my head during a run today. I started laughing like crazy lol

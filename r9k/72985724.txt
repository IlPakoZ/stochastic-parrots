Are you sure that you actually want a boyfriend? Sometimes society brainwashes you into thinking you want something that your heart doesn't really desire that much. For example, you said that you don't go out. If your heart truly drove you to get a boyfriend, you'd be going out, as the two things go hand in hand.

Well I'm a bio woman and never had one I just don't get it. Do I need to pretend to be there gf? That's to cruel for me

If you post your discord here and offer to talk to men platonically for a fee, you will have dozens of offers

you need to improve your personality and stop being so entitled
just forget about finding a boyfriend and it will come naturally. when you stop chasing it, it will come to you, but if you chase it, you will never catch it
also, try showering and taking take of your personal hygene more
and you also really sound like you should go to therapy, because you sound desperate, and we dont know what you're capable of in the future

Mh should try that maybe but the hate would be massiv right

Not everyone that feels defeated by something decides to jump off a cliff.

Btw, have you tried e-dating? To me it's a meme, but it could work for total shut ins i guess

i really do want a boyfriend but moreso just the companionship and romantic commitment with a man to build a life with, so yea a boyfriend/husband, whatever you want to call it. im already pretty old and the clock is ticking lol
>>72985830
brown/black men around my age
>>72985845
how am i entitled for wanting a boyfriend also my hygiene is fine
and how exactly will a man magically appear in my life, i cant meet anyone irl at the moment due to circumstances so ive accepted the fact that im going to find one via the internet, and i know i have to be the one to make the first move/reach out since i dont put myself out there

Maybe take a chunk of time out of your day to just reflect on what you really want? I mean a big chunk, like a solid 8 hours of really thinking hard about this. If you reflect on the things you most want in life, you'll probably find that your body just naturally gets moving to pursue them. You want these things so much that you're "driven" to do the things that lead to getting them. Take money for example. Most people don't struggle to make themselves go to work: they want money SO BADLY that they take it for granted they have to do the "work" thing. If your heart truly desires a boyfriend--like near the top of your priority list kind of desire--you'll find ways to make it happen. Going out, adding people from the internet, or perhaps mass messaging instagram guys like you said. If you want a boyfriend and are struggling to find the time to go out, then you might not want one as much as you think, or you might want something else (e.g. free time) a lot more, pushing the boyfriend thing down your priority list.
Here's a concrete example from my life: I theoretically want a girlfriend. And I want it enough that I'm willing to do swiping sessions on Tinder every now and then. However, I want to enjoy my hobbies more, so I don't find the time to really put in the work to get a GF. It just so happens that I want other things more. I can't muster much more effort into "getting a girlfriend" than a few right swipes a week.

Lose weight or settle for that guy you think is ugly.

>>72985980
What an absolutely garbage view lol. Don't listen to a single word of this guy. He has no clue what he's talking about.
--- 72986077
Are you black yourself? If so I will be your white husband.

i guess you're right desu
i really do want a man in my life, but fear also pushes me back for example theres a guy that i think is cute that i followed but never messaged, i'm just expecting rejection. i get really embarrassed and scared when seeking out guys, i feel like a creep/weirdo and even moreso if they dont respond or ignore me. but i also dont want to be an insane freak that mass messages random men on social media, is that how normal people do it? you reply made me realize i could do so much more to get to my "goal" of having a relationship, but i dont know whats appropriate or not. i hope my rambling makes sense
>>72985999
i have and am losing weight
>>72985997
im an arab african, my preference is actually someone who's from the same culture as me but thats just a plus, im trying hard not to be specific with my standards 
>>72986077

It's perfectly OK to message loads and loads of men, and even flirt with them. But you'll ideally want to wait for them to actually ask you out. If you're a woman, leading the relationship, asking the guy out, putting in more effort to maintain the relationship, is kinda dangerous because it can get you into 'relationships' with guys who are actually only there for the sex or a confidence boost. Just talk to lots and lots of guys and be welcoming and flirtatious should they start showing some initiative to contact you later.

You will need to post a picture of your bare tits for verification purposes.
Just order us to jerk off to it and we will and you should get a decent confidence/ego boost from it.

>What are you like

>What do you look for in a guy?
attractive (by my standards)
sweet
thats all! i literally just want a best friend to do fun stuff with and have babies with 
>>72986162
>guys who are actually only there for the sex or a confidence boost
i made this mistake with my first "relationship" but it was an e-relationship that didnt last longer than a week, i pursued him first romantically, and he immediately sent me a dick pic after. it was demoralizing
> It's perfectly OK to message loads and loads of men
even men you completely don't know? i'll take your advice and finally slide into his dms or whatever anon, he doesn't follow me back so he probably isn't interested but its worth a try. this is really starting to sound like a job hunt lol, and i'm failing at that too 
>>72986167
dont need an ego boost ,not a whore despite me being on this website

You have what? Settled or lost weight? You haven't done either if you can't get a BF. Or, here's another crazy idea, approach a fucking man.

This is the dumbest shit my gut, when have you ever seen this happening?
This doesn't happen for a reason and it's because even women look pathetic when they keep doing this 

>>72986568
Refer to this thread >>72982590

--- 72986811
I found a bf on 4chan I just posted what I wanted in a bf and tons of men contacted me. Then I chose the best one that was closest and dated him for a while then decided we had good chemistry and the rest is history. I haven't had a friend since 2017 even online. He worships me and we live together

Most recent GF was someone I met through a /soc/ state thread.
She didn't post, but I did and she apparently found it interesting enough to contact me. Lived about an hour apart, met up after a few weeks, stayed together a little over three years.
Pretty normal relationship outside of meeting on 4chan.

>women look pathetic when they keep doing this 
does it really matter when youre out of options and desperate? isnt the whole ~slide in your dms~ thing culturally accepted or is that not a thing anymore?
 i do have a fear of being percieved as weird and delusional by a guy , thats the only thing holding me back
>And how are you Arab if you're African? Muslim maybe, but not Arab
i am north african, they speak arabic in those countries so theyre considered arab~ idk it depends on who you ask tho
>>72986616
kindly no but thank you 
>>72986801
>certain physical traits
nice eyes, masculine, confident
 i know im not giving much here but picrel is a 10/10 to me if you wanted reference
biggest positive quality is really just face and personality
>>72986811
happy for you anon, i might use that as a last resort. how long have you guys been together?
>>72986983

Thirty percent women admitted using dates as meal tickets.

It's depressing when you realize that more than half of the people in relationships are together for superficial reasons.
--- 73151021
>>73150999
More like 99 percent people like are. Genuine love is and always has been considered a mental illness.

I was using a dating site a few times. I've talked with about 20 girls, and 2 were obviously wanting a meal for the 1st date. Told them it's against my personal policy for dates. They blocked me quick. 

I considered the block a favor for me. Don't want anything to do with that type of people.

>I cant get a gf no matter what i do!!! All the women hate me and reject me! im still a virgin because on my height not because of my toxic necrotic personality....
>Girl:hi anon want to go on a date to a restaurant
>GOLD DIGGER WHORE GO DIE!!!!
Lonely "incels" huh...
--- 73151104
this reminds me of my ex while dating originally

>gold digger whore go die in le all caps
This isnt even hyperbole, its just strawman lmao
--- 73151141
>>73151103
in that situation it entirely depends if it's on her or if she's willing to split the bill. If you invite me to a restaurant then make me pay for both of us you can go fuck yourself.
--- 73151233
>>73151141
>Girls just wont fuck me no matter what i do i think its just because of my height and face...
>Girl:Hey anon want to go to grab some food and talk?
>YOU STUPID WHORE HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST I BUY YOU A HAMBURGER YOU FUCKING GOLDDIGGING BITCH YOU JUST WANT ME FOR MY WELFARE KILL YOURSELF.
>Girl:ok bye...
Sigh im so lonely...
I think its just because im ugly all the girls just want Chad...
--- 73151253
>>73151103
if you cant tell this girl is only using anon for a free meal then you are a dumbass who has probably spent thousands taking girls out and got nothing in return
>girls dont owe you sex for taking them out
fine then I wont take you out. no pussy no date.
--- 73151269
>>73150946 (OP)
Kek. What did she say after that?
--- 73151271
>>73151253
So you want a transactional relationship from the outset. Weird.
--- 73151283
>>73150999
That's just reality and it has always been that way. Men are huge suckers for romance and true love while woman are more pragmatic seeing men as utilitarian cogs that exist solely to serve them.

nice bait nigger, unfortunately for you I'm not some retarded raging incel and just a lonely dude with standards

>>73150946 (OP)
Good job, OP. Don't let roasties walk all over you. Even if she started seeing you romantically after taking her to korean bbq she would treat you like a cuck and cheat on you afterwards since you would have established you're easy to walk all over.
--- 73151403
>>73150946 (OP)
Good on you.
--- 73151409
>>73151271
isnt that what all relationships are? if a girl is telling me to take her out, I will only if she offers something in return. id only take a girl out for dinner for nothing in return if I liked her but sounds like girl in op is just trying to swindle him out of a free meal

>Every time I consider getting a gf I see all the hoops someone of my level of attractiveness would have to jump through and feel discouraged 
>Honestly don't even mind being single for the most part despite the occasional pang of "tfw no gf"
>Know full well that my fantasies of what it'd be like to have a gf are nothing like the reality of having to be some shallow roastie's meal ticket, dancing monkey and emotional support blanket
>somehow still get "tfw no gf" sometimes 
It's really just annoying more than anything

you'd be truly surprised how many men are willing to completely subjugate themselves and completely forfeit their own sense of independence and identity for some pussy.

it's really no wonder women think they can get away with murder and look down on non-chads as human insects

How does someone live like this, man? Not trying to be a dick. What are your family like?

if shes not passionately trying to suck your cock from the start she's not into you, retard. at that point its always transactional. tall height and handsome face is all there is to it.

>Its only okay when women do it!
Nah, fuck off hypocrite. You want to use a date for free food? I want a date for pussy.
--- 73152734
>>73151103
>Girl:hi anon want to go on a date to a restaurant
Actually what I believe she said was "buy a specific type of food right now or I won't meet you" not "hi anon please take me out on a date." You completely changed the language for a reason (because you understand her behavior was inappropriate).
--- 73152745
>>73151233
>Girl:Hey anon want to go to grab some food and talk?
Another complete misrepresentation of what she said

Stop falling for this obvious bait
--- 73152762
>>73151103
Clearly baiting but why would that stop me from responding. Going on a "date" like this one will ALWAYS end up with you keeping your incel status intact. Woman will never give you pussy if she sees you giving her shit she wants like this.
--- 73152812
>>73150946 (OP)
I would just schedule the date and wouldn't go.

women are grazing cattle. all they do is eat, sleep, shit, and fuck strange men sometimes for money.
--- 73152989
>>73152927
think about it
women may like korean bbq or japanese sushi rolls 
but they are totally indifferent to why south korea and north korea are in conflict or 
why the japanese economy collapsed
in some sense, women are no different than pigs who eat and defecate in a pigpen every day

Same boat as me, everything else in my life is going pretty good except no gf. I can't stand putting on an inauthentic clown show of a personality so I only attract desperate fatties.

I was raised religious and was indoctrinated really with all of the notions about selfless unconditional love and committing for a lifetime through anything etc. I was also taught that men are basically evil monsters so in my youth I tried very hard to be better. Eventually though reality hit like a sack of bricks when it became clear that the women I was dating did not share those sentiments even remotely. 

Part of the issue is that young women are so overwhelmed with options that they very well might date you for a time then hop ship if they find someone they deem an upgrade. Its all selfish and transactional. There was one girl I truly loved and dated for years. Planned to propose to not a month before she left me another man. That experience basically ruined my life and destroyed my worldview.

Anyway eventually I deconverted from my religion and Im not such a sap about love anymore. At the end of the day I recognize that I am on some level just an object. My value to others is determined by what needs of theirs I meet, to what extent, and for what cost. You eventually learn through harsh experience not to get too attached and that 99.8 percent of people are completely out for themselves. Such is life. I miss those early days though, I was much happier in my delusion.

People like you that out themselves as these very same gold digging whores do everyone a favor by exposing your true nature. In reality your kind are spoiled entitled narcissists that think men should pay you for the quote privilege of your time. Pathetic. I hope you die a lonely spinster cat lady but like many people you will probably just seep deeper into your own delusional bullshit and keep blaming men when you were the inconsiderate retard from square one.

Oooooh the scary incels lol. Yes, I too dismiss arguments with Ad Homs. God damn women like you are actually retarded.

The line between satire, bait, and genuine retardation gets harder to discern by the day. Many women really REALLY are this stupid and will argue this level of nonsense to your face. Have you ever been on reddit? What wouldve once been considered immediate satire is now a genuine statement of belief in many cases. No harm in shredding dumbass viewpoints bait or no.

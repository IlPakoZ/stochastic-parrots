>yfw you imagine yourself dying

Yeah. The thought of permanent sleep is kind of appealing sometimes. Lately I just really don't see any point to it. Nothing is gonna change whether I live or die. I mean, I always knew that, but before I felt like that didn't matter and that I would just try to enjoy myself. But now I'm thinking that there's no point to even that, because I won't be around to remember that I enjoyed my life. There's literally no point. The only difference is I won't be anxious and tired anymore.

Yeah, hopefully it's that. I kind of doubt Hell exists though but what do i fucking know. If god wants it to seem like hell doesn't exist then that's how it'll be. But the concept of any positive afterlife seems too good to be true.

I think the idea of hell scares you because a part of you believes you will go to hell.

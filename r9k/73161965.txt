Kind of weird how he's a grown man trying to make it all so edgy with the lightning, but whatever. This is the only one worth listening to: https://youtu.be/yujP3-AxXsI [Embed] that man is probably the most accomplished man I've ever heard of.

The MACVSOG podcasts from Jocko are really good. He interviews some secret special forces units from the Vietnam war era who did some insane stuff back in the day. Watch every interview he did with John Stryker Meyer and Dick Thompson, those are really good because Jocko doesn't mention BJJ once during the whole thing

The best podcasts are 180-183,186, 204-206 and 247-248. Every one of these are great. These guys were black ops guys who did the most dangerous stuff during the Vietnam war in Laos and Cambodia where the US never should've been according to international agreements they made. Congress didn't even know the unit existed and they had to sign a 20-year NDA about their unit and everything they did.

Here's a great podcast/interview of a similar type of guy:

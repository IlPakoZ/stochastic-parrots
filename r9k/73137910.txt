I recommend downloading some introductory textbooks for physics and math. My classes used Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday and it was pretty good for introductory material; Calculus by Stewart was also good; Vector Calculus by Colley; Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems by Boyce.

They're all babby's firsts but they're good for learning and getting a foothold. Don't be afraid to look up solutions manuals either.

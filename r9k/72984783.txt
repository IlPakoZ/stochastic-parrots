The Rapture is not Biblical.

God did not save Christ when he was being nailed to the cross, he will not spare us from suffering if it is his will. 

Begone, Satan.

You realize the early Christians endured a life of torture and martyrdom? 
Nobody ever said being a Christian = worldly blessings. It's actually the contrary, life gets harder when you find Christ because you are given a new mind. You are taken out of the world, so to speak.

worldliness isn't fulfilling, and Christ established that people who are lovers of the world are enemies of The Father. 
When a worldly, rich man asked Christ what he needs to do to be saved, Christ told him unless he gives away every single possession then he won't be saved. Not as a matter of works, but because he is so spiritually lost that it's his only hope of real repentance.
Also you don't get saved by saying a couple words. You need to genuinely have faith. You can't just live a terrible life then say "oh btw Jesus you're kinda cool" on your deathbed and expect to be saved. You need to genuinely repent like the criminal on the cross next to Christ's. 
regardless, you're falling into covetousness. Stop thinking about other people and what they're doing. Focus on your own path.

if one of those rewards is a loving wife who I can make babies with then ill worship any god you want of me.

Jesus said there is no marriage in heaven. Try Mormonism

I'm not confessing my sins here. I've legitimately considered booking a plane ticket so I can confess in a foreign country.

This poses a good question: In the unlikely event that a robot finds a wife, should he tell her about his sinful past?
--- 72985301
>>72985244
then how would heaven be a reward for an incel? spending eternity alone isnt my idea of heaven

Literally living forever and ruling the universe alongside God

>He thinks that sex and the human construct of marriage is the only way that he can possibly have fulfilling relationships with any other human. Not to mention the fact that he will be in the presence of the one essence in existence that has perfect communion with itself and that he too will share in that communion with.

Well, on the off-chance... I've lived my life atoning for any and all sins my younger self committed. My life to this point has felt like perdition. If there is a Heaven, I would love to experience happiness at least once. I'd rather have reincarnation though. Please.

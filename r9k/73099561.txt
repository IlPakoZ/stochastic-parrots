>S-Sorry, femanon... The doctors couldn't save my pp ;_;
How many of you love your bf enough to stay with him after that?
--- 73099572
No one should be obligated to stay with their partner if they get in an accident and become that disabled. I would leave my gf if this happened to her, I didnt sign up to be a care taker
--- 73099576
>WE DID IT, WE SAVED HIS LIFE! OF COURSE HE CANT WALK, CANT DO PROPER HUMAN ACTIVITIES, CANT USE HIS PENIS AND CONSEQUENTIALLY WONT HAVE A CHILD, BUT WE DID IT, HES ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!

>>73099576
I think the final decision should be left with him. He probably would have rethought some stuff after the anesthesia high wore off.
>>73099561 (OP)
This is an old ass image. Did his gf leave him or cuck him? Would be a great person if she didn't.
--- 73099591
How do you fuck up driving a forklift so badly that the doctors straight up cut you in half?
--- 73099592
If you're just bf/gf you aren't obligated to stay with them if something like that happens, although if you're a good person you'd still give them emotional support after you leave them so they don't kys. The real problem are the people who would leave their husband/wife in this situation.

he still has a hand at least, if I had both my hands missing I'd prob kms. If I was only with 1 hand as a limb, I'd probably just see if I can deal with it, and I guess hope that in the future I can get some legs.
--- 73099599
>>73099576
He begged his doctor to keep him alive no matter what and said he was happy he was saved even though he doesn't have a dick anymore.
Also his gf stuck with him and they got married.
I think it's really wholesome and cool his gf (now wife) stayed with him. That's true love.
--- 73099601
>>73099594
I have no hands, but I must kms
--- 73099602
>>73099576
And he should be grateful!
--- 73099610
>>73099599
she stayed out of pity thats what. now he lives like a dog
--- 73099626
>>73099610
Cant win with you retards. If she stays its out if pity, if she leaves she is a heartless whore who never loved him.
--- 73099629
It would be hard to date him because he is in chronic pain and has a shortened lifespan. Plus all the care he needs. I'm glad he has such a supportive wife they seem to be doing ok
>>73099576

He's stronger and more of a man than you even without a cock.
--- 73099634
>>73099626
You really think a woman can love a man with no cock? Grow up anon
--- 73099635
>>73099610
You really think she's been caretaking him 24/7 for 4 years now just out of pity?
Maybe a few months or a year someone could do that but if you're staying with a guy for 4 years and got married and still do sex acts with him presumably involving his mouth then that's probably more than just pity. It's love.
--- 73099636
>>73099626
Yep, fucking shithole
--- 73099638
>>73099635
yes, he is the kid she cant have

I agree with this.
Usually I side with the misogynists but the male anons in this thread are acting the way I'd expect women to.
I might have just accidentally cured my misogyny. Maybe we were the bad gender all along.

I would stay with and take care of a gf who had her bottom half amputated. Just means you'd need to hug her more often and do fun stuff with her to take her mind off it.
--- 73099908

If their relationship isn't lifefuel to you, then you're hopelessly lost. I remember so many anons praying on his relationship's downfall to confirm all their negative opinions of women. Well 4 years later and they're still happily together, say what oyu will about looks only mattering, women being whores etc. this relationship alone proves there's more to life than that. Even if she stayed partly out of spite to doomers and ends up leaving him, 4 years is more than enough time to prove there's something more there than doomer anons insist on.

Cockless *unintelligent* men, but you don't need to be a jerk about it. They didn't choose to be born that way.

This sounds weird but what did they do with his lower half? Did they bury it like a funeral or throw half his torso in a trash bin?? Man lost half his body
--- 73100179

Cheap funeral it was half off

We're already celibate so it's a non-issue.
>>73099572
It's not an obligation, it's just the right thing to do if you love somebody.

>Usually I side with the misogynists but the male anons in this thread are acting the way I'd expect women to.
unironically what cured mine. even added a melancholic tinge of misandry to know that 90% of r9k "criticism" of women is just bad people projecting.
--- 73100231
>>73100212
Why are you two celibate if you don't mind me asking, anon?
--- 73100279
>>73100176
When you get a amputation the person has the choice to keep it or let the hospital cremate it.
He probably just gave the other half to the hospital to go burn it.
--- 73100296
>>73100231
A long list of reasons, here's some main ones.
>he is catholic (no sex before marriage and strict about what birth control is used)
>we are both evil snobs who get high off being "better" than sex havers (insane)
>I'm schizo and for some reason touching a wiener kept sending me off the deep end so it's better not to. (insane)
--- 73100308
>>73100176
They had the lower body stuffed by a taxidermist so the wife can snap her husband's torso onto it like a Megazord and that's how they have sex.
--- 73100648

I looked it up. Apparently this guy was operating the forklift on a bridge and got to close to the edge. Then the lift fell off the edge and dropped 50 feet to the ground and crushed his legs and arm.

Inferior woman with a superiority compact dating a sexually repressed Catholic guy? Cant wait until he cheats on your man because you wont let him fuck you lmao
--- 73100797
>>73100691
>Cant wait until he cheats on your man because you wont let him fuck you lmao
Unclear gay speech. If I "let him fuck me" then I'm damning him to hell. If he fucks a man he's damning himself to hell. It's like you don't have even the most cursory concept how catholicism works.

You can put down an animal when it's sick but you can't put down a human I always found that weird
--- 73100919
>>73100903
He asked not to be put down, if an animal could ask you'd feel compelled to respect its wishes. A person or animal who can't communicate is different because you have to enforce your own judgment.
--- 73100930
>>73100903
It's weakminded of you that your first response to this is "kill him" instead of "save him" especially when he still wants to live and has good quality of life. I think you are just projecting what you would want for yourself onto him. You'd probably kill yourself over much much less.
--- 73100949
>>73100885
And you think she doesnt cheat on him?
Shes loyal to a man with no penis fine with never having sex again for the rest of her life?

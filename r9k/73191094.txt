I was born into an era where AIs will make all my study and what's left of my dreams obsolete.
I fucking hate this world.

Legit this and no one seems to be talking about it . In 5 years what will most majors be worth and few jobs left will either be fulfilled by extremely smart people or nepotism. What will an engineering degree from a mid school get you in the future?

Im legit considering dropping school and joining my dads truck business and make as much money as possible before total collapse of job market . 


Some one for fuck sakes tell me im overblowing it cause what is use of going to college and investing countless hours just for AI to replace you . 


I got access to chat gpt API and im able to code so much stuff and what wouldve taken me hours or days just takes few minutes.

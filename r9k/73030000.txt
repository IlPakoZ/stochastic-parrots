I was like 13 in 2010, which is around the time that Family Guy was getting "kind of old" and it felt like Seth MacFarlane was getting tired of working on it and wanted to move onto new things.

I had it confirmed to me that I wasn't crazy when I felt like I had faint memories of a hand drawn Peter Griffin, and that this show had actually been going since 1999.

More time has actually passed since then.

It literally never ends and I don't know if it ever will.
I wouldn't say that it's "huge" in America, but apparently it's big enough that Seth MacFarlane is that financially incentivized (or maybe he's strongarmed by a contract) to keep this going. Forever.

i know an autistic girl, but how would i convince her to talk to you?
hint: she thinks i quit 4chan years ago.
--- 73108764
autistic men dont treat you like shit you rancid dishonest turdwhore, you just say that to setup an excuse in conversation of why you teehee go for chads.

dumb insect.

Autistic women are more socially successful than neurotypical men, according to the studies, because women just have to exist. Being socially retarded has no negative impact on their sociosexual success

If you post here often, you likely talk to them without knowing it. The autists worth talking to don't reveal themselves so easily.

>>73108776
ask her how
"hey i read an online post on a forum about an autistic girl who is looking for more autistic girl friends, would you be interested in speaking with her?"

Women are generally more cute and less threatening than men. So it is easier for them to form relationships. Do not need a statistic to see that

@73108787 isn't me btw

Well it was worth a shot

I am growing tired of being mean so i'll be plain this time.

Women do not belong here.

You probably aren't actually a woman.

If you are tired of other people being mean to you, stop being the kind of person that makes other people mean.

I should probably have added that to my post
she's very nice to trans people, even brought up one of her trans friends today, so if you're female-in-progress, she'd be very supportive OP.

I am a genuine woman but that is not the point. I was under the impression that most people here had mental disabilities or mental illnesses that I could relate to. I was not aware this is a male focused forum. Do you have any other recommendations of where I could look?

Thank you for the advice

Not everyone is as unwelcoming as that guy.
If you want a "4chins, but mostly female" - try crystal ( d o t ) cafe

I'm male and I never post there but I do lurk sometimes; it seems like a mostly nice place. Much nicer than here. In fact I wouldn't even post it on here except the thread is pretty much dead so I'm not worried about it getting raided

I am not trans but I would appreciate the friend non the less
--- 73109220
>>73109142
I will take a look, thank you

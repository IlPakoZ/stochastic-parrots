but i can not conceive of me creating content anyone wants to view. it's depressing knowing you are so worthless as a human being that nobody would want to consume any content you create

Just observe and you'll notice the patterns eventually of how this evil works

Anyone will view anything. It's also about putting out what you want to see. Go for it anon, 0 views or a million, do what you want to do.

Then you just want fame, you don't truly want to create. You already got filtered.

i would be satisfied with 100 viewers on a livestream, anything under that im not satisfied, yet somehow even 100 seems impossible

ive seen many of their careers be destroyed lately, for each one that falls, opportunities open up

What content do you want to make? I myself make things too.

You don't have to reinvent the wheel anon. Look at Demon Slayer. It's honestly a little generic, but it's very well executed and the characters are cool. Don't stress out about it. Just make sure you aren't creating a low quality product. Think about the audience you want and go make content.

You want to be a streamer? I suppose that's a bit hard but I think you can make it. Nobody does it overnight. Think about what niche you want to fulfill and just get into it.

Why would you want to do something that's pure chance even if you really are some kind of sociopath that loves being on camera? Why not just do something you can tolerate until you can fuck off into the woods one day?
Social media faggots are just politicians without brains.

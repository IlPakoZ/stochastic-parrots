I being being pushed into one. Id rather be volceI than date out. I hate how common theyve become. I hate peoples apathy towards interracial. The idea of the whole world blending into one brown mass makes so sick and beings me to tears. We need to work on genetic technology that can detect and clean up the impurities of genetics.

melanin is used to block ultraviolet from the sun and prevent sun burns and the only habitable planet close enough to the sun for ppl to get sunburns is earth

The earth's atmosphere protects us from radiation. Mars is not significantly farther from the sun than the Earth

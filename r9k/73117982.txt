what would you do as that?

Shit plan, also schlicking everyday a few times a day makes orgasms weaker and less satisfying each time. You would have to take breaks, cumbrain 
>>73117990
Absurdly based 

My perfect life:
I become a girlfriend of a hot obsessed with me rich-rich intelligent perfect very tall mixed (white-Asian) guy who doesnt want to ever get married or have kids. I turn out infertile, also lose my period without any hormonal complications. 
He spends all his money on me in the most creative touching romantic ways possible. 
I spend my days fucking him, playing with our animals, taking care of our plants, reading and watching movies together in silence (then lively talking about them), having fun together (fashion weeks, film and music festivals, amusement parks, extreme activities like bungee jumping or skydiving, traveling, sightseeing, shopping sprees etc.), going to parties or organizing parties with him and our friends. 
I create art without worrying about time and money. I forget what stress is. I have fun and spend time with the most amazing person I actually love who understands me more than anyone else. I dont need meds, I dropped out long ago, I sleep well. 
I wake up actually well rested and suck his dick first thing in the morning.

Yeah, its absolutely time to kill myself. Fuck you, OP.

If I were 5% braver I'd actually go through with meeting some of these girls I know online rather than just sexting and telling them "you're too young for me sorry"

maybe I should become an alcoholic

HikkiNEET, of course. I'd be living in a modest sub-rural house, one story with a two-car garage, at least 150 meters from the nearest house. My basement would have a room where I would spend most of my waking day, custom-designed to limit as much outside noise and disturbance as possible. The entire house would be fitted acoustic deadening and triple-pane windows to further this. I hate noise, I hate neighbors, I hate all of it. I'd be alone, no family, no gf, no pets, just me left to my own devices until the day I die.

Why is it despair
--- 73118381
Live in a utopia of femboys and futas where everyone wears heavy clothes and suits, society is made of pockets of friends who hang out and do everything together
Everyone is cute and emotionally open and supportive, we do each others hair and makeup and nails and play dress up all the time, and everyone who lives in my neo-tribe is a part of a band where we make funky music and video games together forever and ever in our little walkable neighborhood. Everything is colorful and people express themselves freely and in a diversity of equally cute ways and that's ok

i would take breaks to play vidya until i get horny again

>My perfect life:
so you wanna be a stacy with a chad bf? reasonable but based

same, period just gets in the way of the endless coom

relatable

it's a fantasy of mine and the reality is often disappointing without a ton of other secondary stuff

what would you eat? would you need all that space if you're spending most of it in a basement?
i don't really want the responsibility of maintaining a house and an apartment would be enough space for me. i just don't want my neighbors hearing me moan on my hitachi for 16 hours a day

i would like to have an absorbing high status career where i work very hard with brain power solving problems and helping people out. and have enough stories and anecdotes powered by quirky and sardonic yet compassionate humor to power me through the cocktail parties i am regularly invited to forever. . lots of people like me and enjoy my company especially my spouse with whom I have one of those relaxed French-style open marriages (none of that gross Anglo "polyamory" thank you). my hard core of a couple ride or die friends across the world bolsters my hundreds of acquaintances. side gig as prolific author of humorous genre-defying speculative fiction

>what would you eat?
I don't like cooking, so I'd be fine with canned food, frozen food, etc. Ever since I lost my sense of taste from coof in late 2021, I have never viewed food the same, even after regaining most of it. As long as I don't starve, I don't care what I eat.
>would you need all that space if you're spending most of it in a basement?
I collect physical media, so I'd like some room to store it all in a climate-controlled space. And it wouldn't be a lot of house anyway. I already live in a single-story house, so I'm used to the size, and it's not much to maintain at all.

what sort of media?

>>73118582
i hope things get better for you since you sound really based

>exactly everything opposite of what OP wants
i don't think it's the opposite, at least from what you posted above. it looks to me we both want to be less mentally ill, have some bodily changes, and live stress free lives where we're free to take life at our own pace without feeling so anxious about the present being unmaintainable

Thank you, it means a lot 
>i don't think it's the opposite
yeah, sorry, youre right actually, we equally want to be happy with our lives, I had no right to project my shit experiences on you. I think what I should have written was that I want a completely different LIFESTYLE than you to achieve the same level of happiness.
--- 73119141

would you want to be loved in your fantasy?

>>73118994
>I had no right to project my shit experiences on you.
you're in the right to do so. i'm fantasizing about a very extreme, perfected version of the hikkineet dream life, even to the point where i want to even change my body to better fit it. to me that's what represents ultimate pleasure and freedom, but i could understand how stagnant one could feel living like that 

i am tired however, goodnight

>what sort of media?
Vinyl records, most are 40-50 years old, some are pushing 70, so I want them to be as comfortable as possible. I have over 600 now, I'd have more if I had more space, so having a whole room/area just for storing them would be great for me.

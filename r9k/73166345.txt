I will stop getting off to normal male fantasies.
I will rewrite my sexuality.
I will only be able to get off if I imagine myself as a woman.
I will turn myself AGP.

Who hasn't dressed in women's clothes and fucked themselves while calling themselves a slutty name?
--- 73166406
>>73166345 (OP)
thats not how it works. AGP is something you're born with, you can't change your sexuality. For some of us its a lifelong battle and curse.
--- 73166422
>>73166404
Like a stripper name or just calling themselves a slut? Or perhaps a name of a slut that they knew?
--- 73166460
>>73166422
Since I first started noticing how great I looked all dressed up, I've called myself Brandy whenever I was all dressed up and acting like a slut. I'll be fucking myself or sucking a dildo and call myself a slut in my normal voice and I just love how it sounds.

That transmaxxing manifesto includes instructions on how to induce AGP if you want.

Aside from whatever it recommends you should probably invest in a VR viewer that goes over your smartphone so you can experience female pov VR porn.
--- 73166995
>>73166884
this is entirely a crock of shit designed to make being AGP sound enticing. Unless you're a literal gigapassoid who looks 100% female having AGP is a hellish curse of never being able to get true sexual relief because your sexuality is wired completely different to your body.

But why do you hate your current sexuality? Can you stop being so obtuse you nigger and explain shit?
--- 73167279
>>73167206
OP already did explain. TOCD would mean she has been obssessively uncertain about being trans or not, so she wants to push herself over the edge as being definitely trans to eliminate the ambiguity and associated anxiety.

I have much to lose by becoming a troon.
>>73167206
I have no interest in dating women or taking the male role in a relationship. Male urges to breed females just get in the way of my life. I hate how being a man involves this biological obsession and chase of pussy which overpowers me. My sexuality males me feel like a gross, brute animal and I don't like it.
Where does the AGP come in? I feel good about imagining myself as a woman, I just wish it extended to sex.
--- 73167548
>>73167279
Ah, I see.
>>73167491
Are you even attracted to men or are you just that disgusted by the masculine side of yourself?
--- 73167570
>>73166345 (OP)
I'm already catfishing people on porn sites and getting off to messages of them dicking me down.
--- 73167575
>>73167548
>Are you even attracted to men
At a platonic level and a bit of meta attraction, yes. I don't feel any carnal lust towards men though.

>are you just that disgusted by the masculine side of yourself?
It's a mix of disgust at my masculine side, and jealousy towards those with a feminine side.
--- 73167612
>>73167575
I've heard people before tell me that they became gay over time, starting with traps and progressively getting off to more masculine fixations of their pornography. Might be worth looking into if you want to change that side of you too.
--- 73167778
>>73167612
I don't know if that will happen at my age. I've heard HRT changes sexuality, but I don't think I'm ready for that.
--- 73167806
>>73167778
The people who told me about that were post-pubescent so I don't think it's about hormones. From what I understand with hormones and sexuality it's more about what kinds of acts turn you on, not necessarily whether you find hairy men hot.

>post nut clarity
Post nut clarity is malebrained.

which is why it'll affect you as soon as you realise what you've done to yourself to try and force yourself to align to a nature that simply doesnt work for you
--- 73167869
>>73167856
also not gonna lie but this thread makes you sound like an agp in denial so maybe go right ahead unless you have a literal straight male sexuality and are attracted to women
--- 73167898
>>73167854
Well VRChat is definitely the place to go to get dicked down. Probably would help you with that side of yourself, although I think chastity is something admirable.
--- 73167924
>>73167856
I need to get rid of the part of me which feels post nut clarity and be fully onboard with this. If I want to be a woman it's only worth it if I want it 100%

>>73167869
>unless you have a literal straight male sexuality and are attracted to women
Yes, that's why I have to force myself to be AGP.

>>73167898
I was talking about SAO levels of VR where I can basically be biologically female in the virtual world. But VRchat is nice too.
--- 73167925
>>73167854
just a suggestion but you could try get into lucid dreaming, when I was a kid i tried to learn how to do that just for the sake of using it to turn myself into a woman, unfortunately I was never successful at it.
--- 73168006
>>73167925
I've looked into it and want to give it a try. I've had some success but only when I have a LOT of free time to meditate and calm down.
--- 73168031
>>73167924
Yeah SAO/Matrix stuff is going to be quite a way's away, but that might be a cheaper alternative to a lot of augmentations and the like. Hope you're saving up money, OP.
--- 73168042
>>73167925
I've been sexually aroused by imagining myself as a girl since the first time I masturbated and I could never be a girl in a lucid dream for more than like 1 second because I get so excited I wake up. Have had lots of non-lucid dreams where I was female though. Maybe some day I'll troon out in real life.
--- 73168071
>>73167924
if you're straight and want to have regular sex with women you're probably too far gone to be AGP (using too far gone as if it were a bad thing not to be AGP haha). At best you might be bisexual.
--- 73168118
>>73168071
I knew I was mentally fucked and it was over at like 13-14 because I never started feeling attracted to girls and as soon as I discovered masturbation I instinctively was drawn to agp fantasies and stimuli. Having transsexual thoughts since being 4 didnt help.
--- 73168235
>>73168031
>Hope you're saving up money, OP.
I probably won't have enough needed to get my ideal body and also the therapy required to become AGP. That sounds like the most expensive thing in the world.

>>73168042
>I could never be a girl in a lucid dream for more than like 1 second because I get so excited I wake up
Yeah lucid dreaming is hard. Even if you do get one then you have to learn how to control it.

>Maybe some day I'll troon out in real life.
You have much more reason to do so than I do.

>>73168071
>if you're straight and want to have regular sex with women you're probably too far gone to be AGP
I really hope not. I want to be AGP.

>(using too far gone as if it were a bad thing not to be AGP haha).
I think it's a bad thing.

>>73168118
Yeah I would trade with you in a heartbeat. I wish I were like that.
--- 73168291
>>73168235
Well, you'd be aiming for age reversal tech when it becomes more cheap(and is of course proven and utilized. Bezos might be funding the pioneering for that, but who knows if it'll work). After that you can wait a good while and continue to work on your problems.

This is giving me deja vu.
--- 73168356
>>73168291
>Well, you'd be aiming for age reversal tech when it becomes more cheap
I don't know if it ever will be cheap.

>After that you can wait a good while and continue to work on your problems.
I can't believe that literal anti aging seems like the easiest part of this. Becoming an immortal man is easier than becoming an AGP woman.

>This is giving me deja vu.
Have we spoken before?
--- 73168375
>>73168356
>I don't know if it ever will be cheap.
Well biotech has gotten cheaper and cheaper as time goes on, just like all forms of tech. So as long as society continues to stay together then it's what you'd expect.
>I can't believe that literal anti aging seems like the easiest part of this.
Even some non-professionals have had success in extending the lifespans of mice several times their normal range.
>Becoming an immortal man is easier than becoming an AGP woman.
Well, one is something that just about everyone with power wants and the other is far more niche.
>Have we spoken before?
Have you made similar threads to this before and had someone come in to tell you that future regenerative medicine/molecular bio advances could get you what you want and that age reversal should be your first goal?
--- 73168655
>>73168375
>Well biotech has gotten cheaper and cheaper as time goes on, just like all forms of tech. So as long as society continues to stay together then it's what you'd expect.
This might not be tech the elites want others to have.

>Well, one is something that just about everyone with power wants and the other is far more niche.
The idea of being 1000 years old and still thinking IWNBAW is depressing. 

>Have you made similar threads to this before and had someone come in to tell you that future regenerative medicine/molecular bio advances could get you what you want and that age reversal should be your first goal?
I believe so? Regenerative medicine in hopes of getting a female body. And cognitive neuroscience in hopes of getting a less mentally ill female mind. I don't know what it takes for a man like me to become a girl.
--- 73168712
>>73168655
>This might not be tech the elites want others to have.
They're not going to be able to stop people from getting it, honestly. Imagine the kind of backlash that would come from them trying to hoard it. Not to mention it's in the government's interest to make all of the people getting welfare/retirement bux to be able to work again. Many of them are skilled workers but are just too old to work and retirees commonly wish they could work again as the years go on.
>The idea of being 1000 years old and still thinking IWNBAW is depressing.
Might be better to view yourself in a way where you don't need to be a carbon copy of a woman, just someone you're comfortable as. Would it really be horrible if you were a very effeminate guy? Would it be awful if you were a guy who was made to effectively be a woman either?
>I believe so?
Seems we've spoken before then.
>I don't know what it takes for a man like me to become a girl.
Probably less than conventional means, but there's all sorts of stuff that's developing in relation to fixing depression and the like. I think I mentioned this before, but maybe it was on another subject &amp; thread, but any kind of tech that could change your sexuality could also lead to really dystopian outcomes. Humans are naturally quite plastic(neurological speaking that is, more intelligent people more so it'd seem), so your own ability to adjust or change over that eon or so isn't out of the question.
--- 73168885
>>73168712
>They're not going to be able to stop people from getting it, honestly. Imagine the kind of backlash that would come from them trying to hoard it.
I want to agree with you but if we draw a line from how healthcare currently works around the world, it could get messy.

>Might be better to view yourself in a way where you don't need to be a carbon copy of a woman, just someone you're comfortable as.
Which still would require a lot of change and probably end up being close to biologically female anyways.

>Probably less than conventional means, but there's all sorts of stuff that's developing in relation to fixing depression and the like. 
For all my talk about wanting to be a woman, I don't think I can handle HRT. Not I'm barely keeping it together as a man, so any additional stress would probably cause me to break. And as a man, my brain just wasn't built to take it and I am really trying to force myself to be something I'm not. But I want it.

>I think I mentioned this before, but maybe it was on another subject &amp; thread, but any kind of tech that could change your sexuality could also lead to really dystopian outcomes.
Yes, it's literal brainwashing. You're trusting the operator of the tech, or even if you do it yourself, the equipment or methods itself to not screw you over.

>Humans are naturally quite plastic(neurological speaking that is, more intelligent people more so it'd seem), so your own ability to adjust or change over that eon or so isn't out of the question.
I hope so. This is my last cope and the one thing that truly keeps me from giving up in life.

AGP sounds fun but when you have it its more like the sexuality of an emotionally stunted and mentally deviant person. It clouds your sexuality and makes it impossible to feel attraction towards others. You can't function sexually in the body you have and most likely the body you have is not suited towards transition.

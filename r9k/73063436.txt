What's worse? Overbite or underbite?

I have a slight underbite that developed after my wisdom teeth in and it's made my jaw look bigger and my face longer, which i think made me look slightly more attractive

Underbite.
Makes you looks like a troll.
Underbite is quite normal.

I have a slight overbite, although I can comfortably keep my jaw in the normal position, it just defaults to an overbite when I let it rest.
It does make an audible clicking sound when I do that though.

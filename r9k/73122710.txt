>Good night
One of the guys in our group was pissed cause he was trying to score with one of them, but I could care less. I was there to have fun and let loose.

Will you lick their BBC cumfilled pussies at the end of the night though?

others are non attractive therefore have no value

So basically you were an overly sexual creep making them uncomfortable and harassing them all night and your friends covered for you because one of them rejected his sexual advances. 
Wow, and people hate us m0ids. I wonder why.
--- 73122889
>>73122864
Exhibit A why clubs aren't worth visiting
--- 73122894
>>73122881
>Harassing them
Yup, sure was chief! Making a few gestures to piss them off was being "Overly sexual". Hell I wasn't even the one who started the conversation, I was MORE than happy to ignore them, but...That was not the case.
--- 73122895
>>73122889
Yeah because of creeper m0ids with inferiority complexes who cant take rejection or no for an answer.
--- 73122904
it was so nice meeting y'all!! 
*drunkily drunk drunks*
*pisses and vomits*
--- 73122906
>>73122889
Eh, depends on the people you're with. If you go with the express purpose to get drunk and groove to some music and not with the purpose to get laid, you may enjoy it.
--- 73122918
>>73122894
You said you repeatedly made kissy faces at them whenever they happened to make eye contact with you. How is that not weird harassment? Women put up with guys trying to molest and rape them from childhood. My ex would have guys sit next to her on the train and start jerking off or fall on top of her and start groping her. Its literally a constant thing they have to put up with. 
So you, weird creeper, constantly making kissy faces at them rings alarm bells and makes them wonder if you are going to try and rape them later in the night. 
Idiot.

>I wasn't even the one who started the conversation
You were though. You started creepily smiling at them and staring at them on the dancefloor, probably while trying to get close to them and dance suggestively with them. 
I can already see youre engaging in denalism and cope. Alcohol lowered your inhibition and you acted like a creepy sexpest and got cold rejected, which sent you into a childish rage, didnt it. 
Yep, deny it. But deep down you know it happened that way.
--- 73122950
>>73122918
Whew, you're mad! Fucking HYSTERICAL! And if they didn't keep shooting me disgusted looks I wouldn't have responded. Also the bouncer didn't seem to care, so no harm no fowl. Also PLEASE FORGIVE ME for not getting on my hands and knees and BEGGING for forgiveness to them KWEEEENS for making them think I was going to rape them!

Yeah because your friend lied about the situation and covered for you, because he was in a rage about one of the girls rejecting his sexual advances. 
What kind of cognitive dissonance do you need to operate on to think you were in the right in this situation. 
God I hope you chemically castrate yourself, man. Before you end up in prison for rape/sexual assault.

Nobody asked you to beg. They asked you to just leave them the fuck alone and stop trying to smile at them and dance with them. You decided to try and ruin their night after that, along with your jilted friend who couldnt take being rejected by them. 
Maybe try developing an ounce of self-awareness.
--- 73122994
I went to a nightclub in Prague once and it was literally packed shoulder to shoulder so you couldn't even dance to the shit music even if you wanted to. Do people unironically enjoy that shit?
--- 73122995
i miss going out and running into redacted it was really weird and phonky B)
--- 73123001
>>73122986
No idea why I keep treading the same ground since you have this fuckin odd ass narrative you've concocted in your mind about the situation, but sure...I've got a few hours before I'm done work!
The play by play:
>Buddy gets out on the dance floor
>Other buddy gets on the dance
>Looks like fun
>I get on the dance floor
>Grooving and having a good time
>Girl keeps giving me weird looks
>Smile and nod saying jack shit
>She walks over to ME and says what was up further
>I respond with that she's a boring cunt and dance away
>Her and her friends kept shooting me shitty looks
>So I shot some back
I do the same with dudes who get buttmad in cars. It seems the kissy face riles up pretty much anyone.
--- 73123004
>>73122981
Try going for women in your own league and you wont have these problems. Continue chasing after and harassing women that are far better looking than you are and you will continue to encounter these problems and likely face more severe ones in the future. 
You are probably a very average looking or below average looking guy with a weird personality and little charisma. You are clearly hypersensitive and super confrontational about it too which is also really tedious and offputting to everyone. 
Take my advice or dont, I know you probably wont. But honestly, your life wont get a modicum better until you do. 
Grow up.

He was minding his own business when some uppitty hobbit deemed that he was weird and decided to tell that to his face. Roasts were mad a sperg was enjoying himself outside of his home. They also tried to kick him out for not giving a fuck about their opinion. Women truly are npcs.
--- 73123080
>>73123004
Kek, I can hear the onions dripping from your sweat glands. It's such stereotypical insults it almost feels like bait, seems like you're projecting btw since you hate yourself and are jealous of low inhib people like the guy in that greentext. Nowhere did he say he was harassing them, much of the time insecure women will just try to bully low status men who are secure in themselves because they want emotional 'vengeance' and to pad their ego at their expense, sort of like you rn. Sadly you swung and missed though anon, I fuck mad bitches

--- 73123107
>>73123080
Secure men dont react the way you did to women telling them theyre really weird, bud. A secure man would have just agreed with them and laughed and continued to dance like they didnt exist. 
You basically tripped over your own shoelaces before you were even out of the gate.
--- 73123113
>>73123088
Hardly. I could care less about "Same fagging" since (As I've stated multiple times) BEHOLD MY FIELD OF FUCKS! NOTICE HOW IT LIES BARREN AND EMPTY FOR YOUR OPINIONS ON THE MATTER!

I'm not him dumbass. Also there's nothing wrong with trolling vindictive roasties. If someone is needlessly cruel and spiteful, they deserve to be mocked and made a fool of. You probably ignored bullies too because that's what you're 'supposed' to do. That's essentially what that roast was trying to do, bully someone they thought was an easy target. He turned it around on them in beautiful fashion and justice was served while they could only seethe, simple as

Amazing how women can get away with this shit. Say this to another guy and there's a very real chance that you're getting into a physical fight. 
There's no discussion here. It's just that person trying to posture themselves and dominate you. So, men understand the only way out of that bullshit is to actually physically dominate the other dude who's trying to fuck with them.

--- 73123405
>>73123282
>Translation: Men are so insecure that someone making a passing comment incites them to physical violence

You realize this is why so many men are emotionally stunted, cognitively crippled mantoddlers right? Because they spend their entire lives reacting to any and all criticism with extreme hostility and aggression. 
Thats how you end up with scenarios like grown men not knowing theyre walking around stinking like shit because you never wash your asshole properly. 
Or how most men have extremely obnoxious, unbearable personalities and mannerisms that make everyone not want to be around them. 

The loneliness epidemic among adult men today and the skyrocketing suicide rate is entirely self-fulfilling and earned.
--- 73123518
>>73123405
Insecurity is a bad thing retard. Everyone is insecure to some extent. The only people who expect men to never be insecure are women who are little more than overgrown little children. They idealize men and lust after a man that doesn't exist instead of coming to reality where even rich Chad is insecure about shit, in fact for a lot of successful men they are successful because they are insecure. I'm sick and tired of this label insecure being thrown around by immature women who refuse to let men be people with flaws. Yeah I'm insecure and so are you so shut the fuck up about it and let people have their issues they have to deal with instead of shaming men for having any sort of emotions. Kill yourself stupid hole

No retard, I'm at the last step to recognizing the shit tier society women have made this place and the awful expectations they continue to have for us. Feminists need to be shot in the streets because they are our greatest enemy. We can't have any sort of discussion about the genuinely unhealthy expectations women have of men because the conversation is constantly framed in a way to insult men and further shame them for any emotions they have. Kill yourself immediately.

Hmm, a choice between SMC or BBC. Both guys will be the same obnoxious asshats. Difference is the black guy is at least physically appealing and takes care of himself and doesnt have a maggotdick.

Men don't have any unhealthy expectations of women, genuinely. Just take care of yourself and don't sleep with people outside of a committed relationship. That's literally it. "Don't be fat" might be the single most healthy expectation you can have of your partner possible. I mean it is literally about you being physically healthy.

Ended up getting kicked out because I befriended some of the dude bros and we were horsing around grinding on one another imitating the women of the dance floor. From what I heard the club only lasted a year, closed down because people stopped going

Can we please let go of the narrative that men don't produce anymore because
>"Muh society made us feel useless"

That is a member created by soft beta male rejects who want pitty and cry baby moms who want to infantize their adult sons

I did not stop busting my ass because a cult of whores old people and universities told me I was useless... 

I STOPPED BUSTING MY ASS BECAUSE FOR THE OPPISITE REASON, I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE USEFUL TO ANYONE!!!!!

I don't want to be a high value man, High value men are only valued in the sense that they are useful to other people, same with a beta provider. What kind of human being capable of complex abstract thought who loves him or herself wants to live his or her life serving someone else?

You probably wouldn't have done shit anyways and are into good for a plebian job. Time has never been better for achievers and high value men who have the ability to take what they want. Stop coping.

The thing is I never wanted what they have, society pressures you into wanting the zo called basics then when many men get those things they realize their life is a nightmare anyway and wish they'd lived their life on their terms

That's all I want to live my life on my terms not someome else's. I don't want to be of use to anyone but myself. I want to do enough to have enough and not let anyone get the best of me.

You are based, unfortunately if your existence doesn't benefit the state of Israel it's heresy

So what's the point of your post? You only talk about bums like yourself. Who cares.

The point of my post is in response to that crying ass pitty thread with that old lady ranting about her 25 year old son like he's some lost teenager.

It's completely inaccurate and sends the wrong message to actual young men about whats actually going on, most men these days aren't lost they're finally freeing themselves from a life of institutional enslavement and doing just enough to satisfy themselves, which is the only thing a human being should be doing.

If I bust my ass in skilled trades for 20 years what am I left with? Joint pains and aches, mediocre savings, sub par retirement in an already failing economy? Meanwhile the company I worked for made a fortune off my hard work while I'm too broken down to even swing a hammer! I practically gave every bit of my health and sanity, an entire lifetime just for everyone around me to use me, just to build a company and make someone rich I don't even like, to provide for kids who probably only fear me and not actually respect me, and to co partnership with some ungrateful bitch. Does that sound like a good life to you?

That's the real reason we are dropping out of society. The dating scene and unavailability of modern women just made it all that much more easy to not get sucked into the trap and give us time to figure things out.

I'm not optting out because I'm not being encouraged, lol I'm opting out because there's nothing in it for me, never had been.

The blue print is to work low stress jobs/odd jobs avoid taxes, save up your nest egg, take 2 to 3 month long vacations from work at a time, all while doing things you actually ENJOY doing like going to the gym fishing writing stories mma doing art playing guitaire traveling and listening to music resne and repeat while preserving as much of your health as possible the course of your life.

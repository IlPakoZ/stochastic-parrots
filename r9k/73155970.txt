>Are you scared of women
Used to be. Forced myself into romantic and platonic situations with women enough to now I don't care anymore. You'll eventually discover that they're human just like us.

I used to be because, as an introverted guy, I was used to women looking at me with this impatient, dismissive "ick" face. For all their grandstanding about being such warm and accepting and inclusive people, women can't even TRY to hide their visceral disgust for men who aren't masculine.

But then I got a job that required me to break bad news to clients and get yelled at, and if you get desensitized to grown men yelling in your face, suddenly a chick with an attitude problem isn't that scary anymore.

I actually, genuinely, have no idea. I saw a cute girl that was exactly my type on the bus the other day and thought that because I'm in my mid 20's I should at least try talking to her because worst case scenario I can get off the bus and never see her again. Then we made eye contact and I literally got an anxiety attack and gave up on the idea. This has never happened to me before, I used to have female friends growing up, but lately, I feel extremely guilty and almost frightened at the idea of being romantic or sexual with a woman.

I was fat and ugly most of my life. I lost a bunch of weight and girls started hitting on me but im almost 30 now so I get scared and don't know how to react

I'm afraid of being judged by both women and men.

I'm not scared of women in particular. Maybe I fear them a little more than men, but I am nearly asexual, so I have no subconscious desire to access their pussy, or a resulting fear of being denied access. Their judgement doesn't really mean any more to me than a man's judgement. I am just deathly afraid of people and being rejected by anyone

I got teased by my parents when I was a kid everytime they saw me talk to a girl my age. It got to a point where I thought I'd just stop talking to girls to get my parents to leave me alone. That went on for several years during important developmental years to the point that I had no idea how to interact with girls unlike everyone else my age.

Scared? No, but I feel uncomfortable and self-aware in their presence.

I am pretty sure I have spent more time jacking off than talking to women in the past 10 years, including those in my family (I'm 20). I've always been quiet but I had multiple bad experiences with women as a kid so I just shut down.

In the platonic sense or about business? Nothing scary about them.

In the romantic sense, I have only seen it end 2 different ways And neither one is good.

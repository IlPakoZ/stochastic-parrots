I had the opportunity about a year ago to get laid with this guy at work who was really hot and kept hitting on me but my flight or fight kicked in and I cussed him out, he quit the day after, I still cannot stop thinking about it

The self sabotage is the reason we still use this board, at this point we should just accept that when a good thing happens we instinctively ruin it

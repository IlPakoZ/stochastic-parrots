My current crushes are 
>4/10 (but cute) cashier 
>54yo milf hair dresser that was probably a 9/10 at her peak. 
Of course, both are completely unattainable by an ugly retard like me.
What about yours?

do you think you have a chance?
>>73020109
I haven't had a proper conversation with a woman in years too. Do you go outside? Crushing on real world women is a bit painful but still a good coping mechanism.

No. I've always struggled with it but in the past few years it's become basically impossible. I was just kinda happy to realise I could still have positive social interactions.

My crush is a delulu mass murderer cult leader with a skilled tongue and a weirdly flamboyant anime interpretation

A girl walking her dogs stopped to talk to me like two weeks ago as I was parking and heading into my place. I never talk to my neighbors so that was nice.

--- 73020455
>>73020369

Crushing on this qt ashki Jewish girl. Her skin is as pale as milk with cute freckles all over it and her smile is to die for. I think she might like me back, despite the fact that I am gross and brown. Gonna ask her out.

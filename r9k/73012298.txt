Okay fembot, I need to know exactly how much you believe I should be making a month to make it comfortable for us to live together without you having to work, and how much you'd require to be happy
--- 73012411
100 doller
--- 73012970
>>73012411
No way, I want a higher quality fembot.
--- 73013068
>>73012970
200 doIIer
--- 73013290
>>73013068
Would a fembot really suck my cock and make food for only $200?
--- 73013369
>>73013290
no but I wood ;))))

Uhh enough to live on comfortably 
I would not want an allowance or anything just someone to love that also loves me
--- 73013607
>>73013555
Well that's the thing, what does 'living comfortably' means?
I'm pretty sure it's completely subjective and depends on people, I don't need much to live comfortably, but I'm not a fembot.
What kind of needs and wants do you have that would cost money, and how much do you believe it amounts to, on average?

Sorry, only female(femoid) are allowed.

depends on where you live but about 10k per month unless you live in SF or NY
--- 73014528

I live in europe. and it depends on whether you want kids or not. no kids? you can be NEET together with me. want kids? make at least 3k a month.

Statistically speaking, you just need to make 30ish percent more than she does for it to not have an impact on your attractiveness. If you are clearing 6 figures a year and still past the 30% mark, that's when it starts becoming a bonus to your attractiveness. If the goal is kids, then make more than she does and enough to keep all of you outside of relative poverty. This is one of the few sociology studies that has been repeatable across times and across cultures worldwide.

idc just be nyeongie
--- 73014628
>>73014528
How about three times that amount?
Do you not want kids then?
--- 73014737
Women don't understand money at all so this is a silly question to ask.
--- 73014748
>>73014515
>You need to be getting something along the lines of the top 1% to get a fembot
Something tells me you're not being quite honest with someone here, whether it's me, or yourself.

>>73014737
See this as a social experiment in me trying to figure out 'how much' would sound like a very attractive amount to the average female browsing the board.

Have your own place (not renting)
Be able to afford about 1k in discretionary spending for me a month
Be able to afford nice takeout and dinners
Holidays once a year
--- 73014753
>>73014628
I'm not sure about my own opinion despite having considered it, so I'm open to both options. 9k a month does sound like a lot though, you're rich aren't you?
--- 73014762
>>73014528
Sign me up for the no kids version. Want to live together offically, or should we get double bux with neighboring apartments instead?
--- 73014797
>>73014762
>double bux with neighboring apartments
ideal
--- 73014831
>>73014797
I'd think so too. 
If only my local housing market wasn't fucked worse than a streethooker during a festival.
--- 73014847
>>73014753
Rich is subjective, I'm not a milionaire, yet at least.

>>73014751
When you say 'discretionary', do you mean you'd want to do it all on your own without me knowing what's happening to that money, or simply that you can use it as you want, but I'm still in the know?

Holidays once a year can be quite a lot of money though, depending on what happens and where they happen.

Depends on location of where we want to settle. I would like somewhere isolated out in the woods, preferably. I would like to have some small animals like chicken or sheep to tend to so im not completely useless. I dont require much to be happy or comfortable. A house, a car that goes back and forth, and basic necessities. A couple cats too. I would like a man who supports my hobbies and doesnt mind spending money on me. Im not materialistic, pretty much all the money I make goes towards hobbies, bills and savings. 
>make at least 3k a month and we will be golden

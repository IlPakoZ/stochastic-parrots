These maps make me comfy. They're from the Synopsis Universae Philologiae, an early work on comparative linguistics by Gottfried Hensel. It was published in 1741. They make me think back to a more simpler time before all this internationalism, cell phones, atheism, immigration, and race mixing. These maps represent "the way things are supposed to be".

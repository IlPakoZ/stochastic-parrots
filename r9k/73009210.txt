Just keep busy. If your hands or thoughts are idle, they will believe their purpose in life fulfilled and attempt to turn the page into oblivion.

Told myself I'd never do it anyway because im too coward (correct) so to stop wasting mental energy. Ill endure whatever life gives me not because im strong, but because im too weak to end this farce early.

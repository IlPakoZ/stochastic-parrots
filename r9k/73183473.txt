True. But dude shouldn't khs for other reasons. Sure frogposting=death but maybe we can show some leniency to the frogposting scum. 

"A point in your life" will change. You won't always be having a shit time in life. Would be a shame to miss the future cos you had a hard depressing time at one point.

Same, bro.
Too aspie to work. Too incel to fuck.
I just have to cling to what NEETbux is possible before the sweet release of death.
All hopes of being a wagie and having a normal life with sex was extenguished by my early 30s.
I have nowhere else to go but death. I just want that heart attack already.

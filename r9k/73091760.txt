My official tested score is 131 and I was rushing since I did this at work, so pretty accurate test I'd say
--- 73092014
scrambled words can suck my dick
--- 73092025
>>73092014
Yeah I bombed that part too. Also weird how it said 118 just a second ago but now it's this
--- 73092122
Did this the other day when this thread came up, not sure how close to real IQ this is. I liked the rotating blocks and the central point questions, they were pretty interesting.
--- 73092192
>>73091760 (OP)
Truly high IQ required for this section. How do I become a word, bros?

>How do I become a word, bros?
It says it right there, anon. Are you in that section? Then you are a list of scrambled letters.
--- 73092272
>>73091760 (OP)
I dont wanna know my iq, it freaks me out even if it turns out to be high. I know it wont be low since I took one as a child and that turned out to be quite high, but just knowing your limit is freaky, I am too anxious to take one now when I could take one without being anxious when I was a child

The anagram section doesn't give you anywhere to type in unscrambled words. Is just randomly claiming that the letters can be reconstituted into words the way anagrams are done in Europe? This is an incredibly counter-intuitive format.
--- 73092611
>>73092561
Maybe it's not ideal, but it does penalise guessing so it has that going for it.
--- 73092712
>>73092611

I guess I fail this IQ test, because the instructions for that section do not make any sense. To the extent that there are any instructions for that section, which is nearly undocumented compared to the other sections. How do you propose an answer or answers?
--- 73092751
>>73092712
So if I were to give you the following two anagrams:
HTE and KZY
Put a tick next to which one of those forms a real English word. You would get 0 points for ticking none of them, 1 point for ticking HTE, -1 point for ticking KZY (although I don't know if your overall score can go below 0) and 0 points for ticking both. That's what the test is, except there are obviously many more options.
--- 73092791
>>73092751

OK, I am incredibly dumb.

I thought they were saying that 9 of the word snippets could be *combined* into words. And I was looking for combinations of snippets that made words when unscambled and combined. And I didn't understand how I was supposed to indicate that I had combined snippets together, and what word or words they made.

I didn't realize that it was a test of all three-letter words. That seems kind of ridiculously easy for a test of this kind.
--- 73092794
higher iq than /pol/ from the results so far. What does this mean ?
--- 73092829
>>73091760 (OP)
No. I scored 150 on the last one I did (it was this one, didn't save it doe) years ago but I can tell I'm definitely way dumber than I used to be. I can't focus, think, remember anything. I'd probably score 105 if I took one right now.
--- 73092891

I was the 149, not fake. You would be pretty damn close to me with a better verbal score. Did you also guess on the anagrams? I think a lot of people are forgetting that this test penalises you for guessing.

>quiz starts with vocabulary

Memorization of words is not reflective of IQ. Test disregarded. I'm so sick of retards who think memorization is intelligence.
--- 73093459
>>73093441
Yea, nobody is gonna tell me my dog isn't as intelligent as a human just because he can't read or write! Test disregarded!
--- 73093466
>>73093459
He's right retard. When it comes to raw memorization chimps outperform humans. It's not intelligence.
--- 73093561
>>73093466
It definitely a factor in intelligence though
--- 73093602
>>73093561
Pop quiz: What part of your computer is considered it's "brain" and why?

I'll give you a hint, it's not the hard drive.
--- 73093633
This test doesn't have much resolving power at the top end.
--- 73093635
>>73093602
I have learning difficulty but know the answer to this is the CPU or central processing unit which performs operations for the computer and is liken its brain
--- 73093658
>>73093602
What an embarrassingly midwit response.
--- 73093701
>>73093602
For what it's worth, all program logic (i.e., all of the interesting/clever algorithms; anything but the most basic mathematical operations) is stored in RAM.
--- 73093704
>>73093658
Storage is not processing power you retard. Processing power is what intelligence is. Being able to figure shit out and cross reference things that are unrelated to come to concrete conclusions that are based in reality is what intelligence is.

I'm sorry you think you're smart because you did good on a spelling bee once, but it's simply not true. 

Take this and post your results.

https://iqtestprep.com/mensa-test-practice/

It's a real IQ test. I scored a 133 on it. The only reason I even care about IQ is because I thought I was an idiot my whole life because I was treated like shit by retards like you because I didn't care about wrote memorization. Now I know better.
--- 73093718

What does the cpu do sir?
--- 73093803
>>73091760 (OP)
Scrambled words was retarde
--- 73093817
>>73093756
It does a bunch of extremely simple things (stuff like "rote" addition and multiplication) a billion times per second while keeping some intermediate results (like a scratchpad) around in its cache. But the interesting behavior that you interact with at a high level is defined by the program in RAM.
--- 73093841
>>73093704
Not trying to be funny here but that test was a piece of piss. No cheating, that test was absurdly easy, what the hell?
--- 73093866
>>73093382
Nah, when I couldn't find more I skipped ahead instead of clicking random clusters that seemed like words but I wasn't able to mentally verify
--- 73093875
I misread some instructions and when too quick on certain questions
--- 73093877
>>73091760 (OP)
I also scored 144 on the verbal section of the CCAT iq test, 128 on analogies test, and 115 on the "next word" test
--- 73093878
>>73093633
Yeah. The Mensa practice tests have some pretty gnarly end questions that probably do well in differentiating higher above average scores from lower above average scores.

>>73091760 (OP)
Reminder that if you flex your IQ, you're probably just socially incompetent and/or ugly. Most of all though, you probably get no pussy. No one who is actually smart goes around bragging about their IQ, and if they do, it's probably because they rolled a 1 on their emotional and social skills/intel.
--- 73093896
>>73093888
No one here is flexing
--- 73093902
>>73093875
Another anon screwed by anagrams. I found them difficult as well but still did pretty well at them. I'm surprised people find them as difficult as they do.
>>73093888
I'll take a test on here as a mess about and to compare with other anons, but I'd never bring my IQ up in a non-anonymous setting, that's cringe as fuck.
--- 73093903
>>73093704
Pretty much correct. Thing is, the amount of storage one has accumulated is correlated with the processing power of the mind (there's a reason the more intelligent tend to have larger vocabularies). The better the processor, the more processed. Rote memorization is not just unintelligent, it's bad at memorization.
--- 73093925
>>73093704
Having a working memory is incredibly important. Imagine you're a detective trying to solve a case, and you have to piece together clues, both in the short term for the current case but also the long term of previous cases that may be related. Making the connections between those memories is absolutely a sign of intelligence.
--- 73093930
>>73093888
Yes, AND your IQ is just as important as being socially competent and attractive, in that all of them mean fuck-all. They tell nothing of your moral character or dedication, which is what truly matters.
--- 73093936
>>73093886
Anon's mistake here is thinking that we're all studying the dictionary an hour a night, memorizing words and their definitions, when in reality vocabulary is picked up naturally by people that appreciate the nuance in different ways of expressing similar (but not precisely the same) concepts.
--- 73093955
>>73093886
If you were smart you'd know that we already established that I don't believe that memorization is an indicator of intelligence. We both knew what I meant and if we were speaking it wouldn't have made a difference.

You just want to attack someone for your ego's sake. I dont care. Your words are meaningless to me.

>>73093925
>Making the connections between those memories is absolutely a sign of intelligence.
>Making the connections
>Making the connections
>Making the connections
>Making the connections
Yes. Exactly.
--- 73093962
>>73093902
>Another anon screwed by anagrams
Somewhat maybe, i was kinda expecting to get low on verbal IQ since i am bad at spelling, reading and communication in general
--- 73093981
>>73093955
Yea, I agree, making the connections is an important part of that, but having the memories available is also important, dipshit. If you instantly forget everything you ever see you'll never have the chance to make those connections. So you agree, memory is a part of intelligence. Good. 
Seriously though, answer me about why that test you posted was so easy?
>>73093962
I asked the other anons, but did you also guess on the anagrams?
--- 73093985
>>73093329
Dude, most people who took this test got 100 exactly. The people who got higher are just more likely to post, you're not retarded.
--- 73094015
>>73093981
>but having the memories available is also important
Important or not is not what we are debating. We are debating what intelligence consists of.

>Seriously though, answer me about why that test you posted was so easy?
Either you're super duper smart or it's a teaser so mensa can charge you for a real harder test to smack you back down to bitchville and give you your real score. It's a pretty high IQ marketing move if you think about it. 

I'm fine with my results they wont get my money.
--- 73094020
>>73093981
>did you also guess on the anagrams?
Mostly no, but the guesses i did make were due to not being sure how to spell the words i was thinking they could spell
--- 73094026
Probably about right. Did an IQ test before and got 125. I think my true range is 120-130.
--- 73094054
>>73094026
Btw I have never studied or read books. I think if I maximised my potential that way my IQ would be really high. I am really bright but never tried at school. Oh well. Ill take my high IQ
--- 73094090
>>73094015
If you don't have access to the memories you cannot make the connections, and so you cannot demonstrate that kind of intelligence. The memories are therefore a crucial factor to that kind of intelligence. It's obvious and indisputable.
>or it's a teaser so mensa can charge you for a real harder test to smack you back down to bitchville and give you your real score. 
That is kinda what I thought, but it's also why I liked the test linked in the original OP. The kind of questions were more unique and interesting, more akin to an intelligence test I was given as a kid. Most of these online ones (like the one you linked) are same-y, boring and often easy.
Also you mention it gave you a score of 133, but the score it gave me was simply out of 50. What did you get out of 50?

That was my original score, same pic I used in that thread. For someone whose native language isn't English, doing quite well on the vocabulary and anagrams is actually really impressive.

I used to care a lot about IQ but at some point I realized, IQ really doesn't mean jackshit if you don't do anything with it. Everyone knows who Elon Musk is but most people can't even name who the smartest man in the world is. Who cares if you can do math equations fast and form proper sentences if you're just some wagie stuck working at McDonald's. 

Anyways, apparently I'm an Englishtard. I used to think my verbal reasoning was pretty good but I guess I could improve on that, if that's even how verbal IQ works....

I think this is why IQ tests are a bit iffy. A lot of people say you can't increase your IQ, but you can certainly better prepare for an IQ test and increase your score, even on those Raven's Progressive Matrices tests. Best to take with a hefty pinch of salt.

I'll bully dumbasses like you all day long over this kind of stuff, it's a great way to get a leg up socially because most people don't understand your perspective (which is somewhat correct), and by the time you're getting corrected you already look like a bitch despite any valid responses you might produce
--- 73094818
>>73094015
Intelligence is comprised of crystalline and fluid components. What this test measured was fast committal of new information to memory, which is a demonstration of one's fluid intelligence. The spatial reasoning components also measured this, but with different concepts. 

The vocabulary components were a mix of fluid and crystalline intelligence testing, given that you had to quickly interpret information but also had to check with your accumulated crystalline intelligence to arrive at correct answers.

Anybody who scored decently doesn't have any real problems. If your brain works well, better than a significant portion of the population than why are you here?

Femcels and fembots of r9k, why don't you just download dating apps and find a chad husband and leave your edgy phase for good?

>>72988440 (OP)
>femcels
>fembots
DO NOT EXIST. Holy shit you normies just don't get it. Women CANNOT be incels or robots. Also, just a FYI since you're retarded, anyone claiming to be a woman is just a dude larping for attention. Stop being so goddamn new.
--- 72988466
>>72988440 (OP)
Because the men on those apps only want casual hook ups. Also because I'm permabanned from most major dating apps for trolling

She got 1450 messages and she's a 1/10, I highly doubt all 1450 of them just want sex, retard.

i don't call myself a femcel, but i'm also a bit old-fashioned in the sense that i want to find love organically irl. it might take a while though because i'm not a very social person and don't really go out. 
my opinion is this: i expect to be alone and i'm not complaining about it, but if i meet someone organically, that'd be nice of course.
--- 72989147
>>72989111
It never happens organically. The man puts in a ton of effort and the woman sits back and enjoys the ride and says dumb things like love should happen organically.
--- 72989159
>>72989111
Dating apps are as organic and animalistic it can get
--- 72989169
>>72989147
her typing this out is just her subconcious signlaing to everyone around her that she wants a man to make the effort because shes available. 
god I hope I get to see the day sexbots become a reality. instantly swearing off women forever with 0 regrets. useless trash
--- 72989170
>>72989111
everything's been moved online now. there's no incentive to approach in real life for men. there's only police calls and restraining orders.
--- 72989177
>>72989159
You are autistic. That's not what she means by organic.

What she means is that she's a normal plain jane but unironically expects to just exist and a Chad will appear and sweep her off her feet just like in her rom coms.
--- 72989191
>>72989111
Another man larping as a woman. You know what to do.
--- 72989200
>>72989147
that just sounds like you are chasing unavailable women, you're calling yourself out right now.
my idea is more like having a school or workmate, and you both initiate conversations because you like each other, and then that eventually grows into a romantic relationship.
--- 72989217
>>72989177
Like a chad approaches her in the library? I don't get the female brain. How is that any different from a chad trying to rizz you on Tinder? Fuck, as an incel I'd take anything feminine I can get but women are so picky about even *how* they even meet a chad. It's mind blowing
--- 72989242
>>72989177
forget about Chad, normal guys aren't even bothering approaching either. no one is. 

any guy worth his weight in the dating market nowadays are juggling multiple girls at once. saw it with my own eyes, 6'3 Chad roommate literally bringing over a different girl almost every night of the week. literally told me sometimes he gets so tired of sex he ghosts all these women for a day or two so he can hang out play cod and smoke weed with me. girls just go up to him on campus and put their number in his phone. 

the femanon wants a guy like that to approach her and put in all the effort, when Chad is already busy fucking sluts and has no time for relationship bullshit. the guys that would approach femanon aren't the guys she wants in theory. they're just not handsome/tall enough.
--- 72989327
>>72989242
I mean I'm not looking for a player, there's a reason why I'm still a khhv and didn't go for it when random guys have asked me for hookups. just not into that kind of thing. I'm not right-wing at all, but I am fairly monogamous and I would definitely not have sex before being in a 100% committed relationship
--- 72989354
>>72989111
>organically
Either you make an effort to meet a man or a man makes an effort to meet you things don't just magically happen without someone putting in the time and effort to make things change.
--- 72989355
>>72989327
nothing you said contradicts anything he said. all that you have added is that you, in addition to being magically rescued by chad from the confines of your own 4 walls, also need him to commit to you right away.
in fact, you didn't even add that, he had that in his original in the form of
>Chad is already busy fucking sluts and has no time for relationship bullshit
--- 72989395
>>72989242

>>72989355
I'm still in university so I'm hoping to still be in the life stage where "things just happen", it's just that I need to become more social to increase my chances. I don't even have friends so me not being social seems to be the problem.

and I'm not really interested in this mythical "chad" creature, I think that being with someone who is 9-10/10 would not work in a relationship for me. I'd rather be with someone "on my level" and not with someone who gets approached by women on the street lol.

>>72989452
>he thinks women on his level actually want a guy on their level
ALL women want Chad. Doesn't matter what they look like, how much they weigh, where they are from, etc. They all want Chad. Why would any of those women pick you when they have an entire phone full of better looking guys that will fuck them?
--- 72989536
>>72989452
>and I'm not really interested in this mythical "chad" creature
see, 10 years earlier when incels had not yet run countless experiments where they pretended to be attractive child rapists and before some of them started to collect related studies which showed women to lie or be delusional about what they want in men I would have maybe cared about what you say more than not at all
--- 72989584
>>72989536
are you telling me that I'm lying when I said that attractive men have asked me for hookups and I said no? people are different, not everyone is the majority. 
for example the average white man is much more aggressive violent than the average white woman, but I still don't expect to get killed whenever I step outside bc not all men are like that, even if many are.
--- 72989599
>>72989536
The only thing that can ever trump looks is extreme wealth. The more extreme wealth you have, the more fucked up shit you can. This has been proven by those Saudi guys that can piss and shit all over women after flying them out.
--- 72989621
>>72989584
>average white man is much more aggressive violent than the average white woman
You can't prove that as white women hit men all the time. The only difference is nobody reports it and it's never taken seriously.
--- 72989665
>>72989584
>are you telling me that I'm lying when I said that attractive men have asked me for hookups and I said no?
I'm saying women have been repeatedly shown to either lie or be delusion about what they want in men aaaand
before that i what I think you are doing. which you didn't read or didn't comprehend because I did not claim you were lying about rejecting guys

>>Chad is already busy fucking sluts and has no time for relationship bullshit
I try to cover all my bases. respect bro. 
>>72989395
it really is like that. in 4th grade the class bully was the one getting all the girls. that same guy was pulling girls since 1st grade all the way up to 8th grade. it never stopped till he got so out of hand his mom shipped him off to boarding school. kid was an absolute menace and I had to fight him on various occasions. at one point we were friends in middle school, because I managed to kick his ass pretty badly throwing him down a flight of stairs and breaking his nose. would've done it again.
--- 72989687
>>72989621
Men regardless of race are indeed more violent than women, you sound extremely naive. Men killing women is an ongoing epidemic because it happens so much.

"daddy, why do they never post the absolute numbers and only ever the relative ones?" 
"ah, you see child, that's because they are lying, amoral, manipulative rat-human hybrid creature belonging in the sewers!"
--- 72989729
>>72989687
You're moving the goalposts. First you said violent, now you're saying killing. Already went full blown fallacy. You lost.
--- 72989761
>>72989512
nope. she's still going for Chad, but instead of the top 1% she's going for the top 0.01%. why? because she wants a Chad to fall out of nowhere onto her lap, and commit to her right away. the guy "on her level" is literally Chad because the woman's narcissism is through the roof. the guy she's interested in will be Chad by default. other women at least don't expect to lock down a Chad right away, they give sex in hopes of that. femanon wants it all without giving anything, and it has to be magical, he has to come in at just the right time saying all the right things. literally like some disney romcom bullshit. 

just ain't gonna happen.
--- 72989766
>>72989729
don't accept the framing. make her provide actual stats for this "epidemic". 
no way you will be able to disprove some random study you have never seen but if she has to post stats the next time you can know what's wrong with them and call her out
--- 72989777

Things don't just happen you dumb bitch, you have to put in effort you have to go out and meet men and make it clear you are interested or at least approachable. Or you are expecting a man to make it happen in which case you're a lazy fuck.

I'm not the kind of asian guy she's looking for but I can chime in that I'm not on dating apps. My reason is that I'm not self absorbed enough to have a million photos of myself which is what the dating app game is all about.

Backpedaling as always, if you still think "incels" exist you are f'n retarded

--- 72990495

try /soc/ then fatty. plenty of autistic asian guys out your league who'll worship you

it's all the same anyway. good looking men can just go outside and find gfs or they can just use a dating app.

do people even go out irl to meet someone anymore? most relationships seem to start online these days, which is why incels are only increasing. finding girls online is already hard enough if youre not chad or dont post yourself to instagram

In the US you would have to be retarded to look online. There are too many easy ways to meet people in real life, and the internet is full of losers and scammers.

She said cute/spergy. I'm a big strong guy, also older.
--- 72990572
>>72990538
I saw a stat page showing that most relationships start online now because theres no need to even go out irl anymore to find somebody.
--- 72990591

--- 72990598
>>72990572
You saw the results of an online survey that said 39% of "relationships" started with an online conversation, and most of those started on groupchats or social networks, not dating apps. The other 61% in that online survey said they met in real life. There's another chart going around right now that says 80% of relationships in 2019 for young people started in the real world (not online). Again, whether you are a statcuck or not, in the US you would have to be mentally retarded and have way too much free time if you are going to waste your life looking for love online. Big luck is needed for that to go well.

How many just be born a women do you talk to every day and actually flirt?
--- 72990641
>>72990516
I think some people still do ,although the ones I know are usually originally from small towns. There's luck involved of course, because even most men aren't really open to interacting with stranger women irl, thanks to this new idea that stranger men and women can only I interact through tinder. Many women publically saying that they don't want men to approach them irl has affected this, but so has tinder itself. its' existence and popularity (mostly among men since tinder's userbase is only 20% female) seems to make people assume that you can only date through it.

if you have to try, it's already over. women make choosing singles, i've been around women all my life and all of them have made it known that i'm a friend at best. i've tried tinder, /soc/ and hinge and i've failed every time. i got called ugly by every girl who added me on /soc/
--- 72990798

>>72990798
it's called being tall and handsome dude
--- 72991036

yeah you are mostly right about that. I guess if girls online went around dating anyone there would be no incels.
--- 72991085
>>72990694
>if you have to live in a country that has women in it, it's over
First of all tinder, /soc/, and hinge is not "trying", it's literally the opposite of trying because you're not putting yourself out there. You got called ugly because you don't spend any time with the bottom 70% of women.
--- 72991126

BUT WHY DO WE NOT JUST LOOK AT STATISTICS AND SEE YOU ARE RETARDED AND TALKING OUT OF YOU ASS WTF AM I POSTING STATS FOR ?ARE THESE IMAGES NOT GETTING UPLOADED OR SOMETHING? WHY DON'T YOU TRY FINDING SOME DATA THAT DOESN'T FALL APART AFTER EXAMINATION

that's never going to happen, I've never initiated conversation with a girl I liked once. and I'm 24
--- 72991754
>>72990362
Yeah, probably. This pattern of behaviour is usually associated with a lack of positive affirmation from the opposite sex

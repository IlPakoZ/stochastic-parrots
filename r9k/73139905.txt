I really don't miss sitting ina super cold office all day watching the clock. A few more years and I'm gonna have enough money to retire to a cheap country. Fuck the system.

Its because the average adult boomer is a drug addict, drunk, or doesnt show up to work. Nevermind all the old people who cant read, write, or use a computer
>those damn dirty nig-
sadly its mostly old white boomers who tried to coast through life.

Get your degree, your certificates, and do any volunteer work or anything related to your field so you can build your resume.

You thinking about thailand? Alot of my friends get married to women there so they can do remote jobs and have wife, kids, and a middle class tier living situation.

This is terrible advice. If you're not lying about shit on your resume, you're fucking up. There's not some giant database where they can check all this shit you know...not yet anyway. At most they can call a number you give them...

At this point the only way to really get ahead is to just lie out your ass. Its the only reason why I am sticking with my mind numbing paper pushing job now.

What was the job anon? Funnily enough planning on breaking into IT myself lol, I did some other shit before and am in accounting now, -5/10 seriously do not fucking recommend

I am actually thinking Thailand, but I have heard a lot of foreigners are moving there now and I'm worried that by the time I have my money together it will be too expensive. It's probably gonna be like 6, or so years until I have the ~$300k I want and a lot can change in that time. Not really looking to get married for anything. Just want a small remote house to live in with my dog. Just need internet, power, plumbing, etc. and some land to grow food for myself. I think I could build a tiny home with the skills I've learned at my job.

I really lucked the fuck out fellow degree-less bros.

>Did a gap year before uni where I went to a remote area to do hospitality work
>Fired only like 3 months into my 1 year contract cause I succked
>Refuse the free ticket back to where I came from due to the shame of getting fired
>Thankfully the remote area is desperate for workers so find another job doing basic admin work in an office
>Stay another year before moving to a city to attend uni.

>Dropped out of university almost right away because I was too depressed to get out of the apartment to attend classes
>Live as a NEET for like a year before my parents threaten to cut me off if I don't get a job
>Go to temp agencies, able to get a few short-term basic admin jobs because of my previous office experience
>Luck out and get a temp agency placement with regional government
>Pays waaay better
>At my third placement in government they end up only really needing me for a few weeks
> the supervisor feels bad about ending my contract so early so finds me somewhere else I can help out

>Asked to help out with a grant program that's understaffed
>Position is technically classified as "admin" so I'm allowed to work it, but doing real, non-admin type work.
>Given surprising amounts of free reign, totally different than the all the rote admin work
>Killing it because I was a nerdy computer kid growing up so I know how to Google things and problem solve.
>Impress folks by completely digitize the grant tracking process
>The position I'm placed in comes up for hiring
>Because the position is technically admin I get hired despite no degree

>Few years later use government reclassification process to ask that my position be classified higher than admin
>Get classified the same as more senior positions that require a degree
>Because I'm already in the position my degree-less-ness doesn't matter
>Now making $85k/year all my coworkers have masters degrees
>Government will also now pay for my upcoming data science courses too
--- 73140441
>go to technical college
>it ends up being a scam, basically a baby sitting program for kids who got kicked out of highschool, 4 thousand dollars and a year down the drain
>go to college
>have to fight to stay awake in class constantly, gain 50lbs and get hooked on antidepressants because of how miserable i am everyday
>dont even pass my classes 
>/pol/ says to go to trade school
>look around for trade schools
>start talking to people
>it turns out trade schools are just colleges with trade programs.
>you have to take college courses along with your trade
>everyone who i have spoken to no matter the path is miserable as fuck.
So what is the right choice /r9k/? I am signed up for an IT program but honestly i dont care about IT or leaving my room. Honestly outside of having sex with women i really do not care about life at all.

I am legitimately completely addicted to BBC cuckold porn. It's becoming unhealthy. I desperately NEED to be cucked by a hot girl, preferably my hypothetical girlfriend/wife. I literally cannot stop thinking about black dicks and white girls.

Spades used to be my favourite suit and I am so bitter about these fetishists ruining it.

racists tried to use spade as an epithet against blacks. it just got reclaimed through cuckoldry kek, so it just came back to bite you in the ass.

I'm like you, robot. My mistake was going too far.

I had an ex girlfriend who reluctantly agreed to cuck me but she didn't like it. Made her feel like a whore. 

Trying to get her to fuck a black guy was the last straw. I know she didn't want to outwardly say it but I know that, for her, the thought of fucking a black guy was disgusting. 

It ultimately led to the breakup. Or at least was a major contributing factor. 

The point is, sometimes some things are just best left as fantasies. Hurting others for your own degenerate fantasies is selfish.

I don't know why others don't see it but cucks are INHERENTLY racist. 

You want to be cucked by a black guy because you don't see them as more beast than human. That's why there's an overlap with the "built for horsecock" and other beastiality threads you see on /b/.

You want to be humiliated by having your SO fuck a perceived "lesser" over you, which puts lower on the pedestal than animal, which in turn humiliates you, and that's what gets you off.

i have a gf who i managed to get into bbc cuckold and even white extinction stuff. we often masturbate together while talking about it, but looking at porn together for some reason isn't as good even tho i thought it was gonna be amazing. i'd imagine that actually getting some black dude to fuck her would be awkward and disappointing. fantasies are much hotter in your head than in reality

The idea of "BBC" is a myth. Black men do not have bigger dicks. 

You know who else has bigger dicks? Barbarians. In history big dicks were seen as uncivilised. It's why ancient statues have tiny dicks. Not big brutes with massive dicks, splitting women open. 

The BBC thing is a holdover from that. Innocent white women defiled by big black monsters with massive dicks, so big they can't even fit it all in.

It's just a racist fetish. I hate black people, so that's probably why I ended up a cuck.

I can only be happy that I am not so stupid that I would ever engage in it irl.

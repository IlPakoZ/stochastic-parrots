Water and semen do not mix. I tried to cum in the shower and my semen got stuck halfway up the shaft. It burns bad. In your circumstance, you likely still have some semen in your shaft since you are cumming so often. As such, when you piss, they mix in your urethra and you experience the joy of semen and water mixing. Stop cumming for a while, that will fix your problems. Or at least, just dont cum prior to pissing within 20 mins or so.

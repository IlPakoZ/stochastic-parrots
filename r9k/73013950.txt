I see this thread on Twitter all the time, a woman posts something of the form "men why don't you look like ________."
Men in the comments section usually do not take it well. They usually say that they can't look that way for whatever reason. However, they never actually question the whole premise of the thread, which is that women have the right to demand men bust their asses non-stop to achieve the body type they want.
I mean could you imagine a man saying "women, why don't you look like [insert anorexic model here]? YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE." He'd be banned for hate speech and fired from his job.
The fact is that society needs to be doing more to PROTECT MEN from FEMALE OPINIONS.

I actually look relatively similar to that guy's muscles. I'm tall too. Problem is my face is ugly as sin. I am the physical embodiment of those gymcel memes. Without the chiseled face you'll get zero attention. Because women aren't attracted to me and I'm strong, I'm treated more as a threat. They will actively avoid any conversation with me for fear of their life.

your first issue is going on Twitter in the first place, social media isn't representative of the world outside and it's been shown by research to make you depressed.

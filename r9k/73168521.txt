The solution to any real issue posed is clearly having some degree of "tech-critical" / "anti-tech" attitude, rather than trying to explain "haha no you see the good self-replicating AI nanobots will patrol the the bad self-replicating AI nanobots" or "see, it's a GOOD thing we don't have humans doing the work that impacts human society, it should be all AI and the people that own it :)".

All AI developer skulls should crushed with a rock, that is my response.

It's basically over. If you're not rich enough to get an invite to the arc, then you're going to be erased. This isn't a conspiracy theory, you are told this openly and have already accepted it.

But most people I talk to think this a nothing burger and when you do to try to explain that its at its infant stage they call you a schizophrenic or someone who isnt educated enough on the matter . Then you show them smart people who believe in what you say or along the same lines but just end up ignoring you . Why are normies so frustrating

Okay again but that's not really going to matter within either of our lifetimes. Not relevant. So basically even if we wanted to be rebellious freedom fighters that would be hard as fuck to do for no benefit.

What do you do specifically? My GP could easily be replaced by a bot. That fag just prescribes pills and sends me to a specialist. Don't get me started on pharmacists. Most medical workers are bad at their job and I welcome them being replaced.

What are some jobs and services that you think can technically be automated but most likely won't due to some kind of "made by real humans!" appeal? It would have to be things that have some kind of core social aspect to it.

I'm in school for geography at the moment. I think that AI has a bit of a foothold here as they can recognize/folllow preset routes and interpret spreadsheets now apparently. But interpreting and creating multi-dimensional maps with data and then applying it is a much more complex task that could take years for AI to master. Plus within my field there can be several "on the ground" components involved depending on the specific job you get, which most robots can't do yet either. So I figure I've got a good few years where I can stock up on resources for myself before my career field dies to AI.

NEETs will inherit the Earth. wagies cannot be go without slaving away for long as they are natural slaves. They also won't be getting NEETbux. They will go insane like they did in 2020 where locking down for a few months and being forced to stay home was the worst thing to ever happen to them. They burn their own homes down. My NEETbux will keep me fed and sheltered while wagies kill and eat eachother. Blessed AI will liberate us from the wagie menace.

AHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHA

ive been talking about this since 2016. nobody EVER took me serious. so many threads i made on this subject, every single one of you smug shit-for-brains retards didnt appreciate it

its okay, tho, its fine. technological automation will take away ALL jobs. ai will take away ALL jobs. soon, ALL of you fucking smug sex having normies, smug roasties, will be worthless neets

just like me
and experience the pain of having no meaningful work, just like me
and experience what its like to live in poverty, just like me
and experience people treating you like you are worth less than human because you dont work, just like me
and experience a life of despair, just like me

just like me. me me me. the pleasure is ALL mine. ive been waiting for this shit like some sinister supervillian

you fucking normies are so stupid and so smug, too. once ai is smarter than humans, it will start making cheap super-robots. these robots will have the ability of a human body. think boston dynamics meets i, robot. this shit is coming and these robots will be dirt cheap, and will be made mostly from carbon

you dont understand. soon EVERYONE will become a worthless member of society. yeah, so enjoy your time right now you smug hypocritical pieces of immoral shit, you filthy normies. enjoy it, because soon, that shit is going BYEBYE

I live by a simple philosophy, myself. If something comes out, its gonna be shit. Even if AI goes nowhere tons of people are still gonna lose their jobs when the very thin threads left maintaining whats left of the economy completely snap, not to mention the mountains of needless social bullshit going on. And hell, below $18 an hour there is literally no fucking point in even working from how little money that brings in for the time you waste, unless you are in bumfuck nowhere I guess. Then you look at the wider state of the world as a whole and realize that maybe its not worth saving, or conversely, no matter what you do or how hard you try it is not going to be.

I am heritage conservator and I dont see how my job will be replaced by robots because its so intertwined between physical, mental and decisionmaking abilities. Ai cant initiate, which is important in conservation. 

My problem is that there is too msny people in this world already so its over anyways.

To Women,

I resent you. I keep wanting to believe there's a sweet, loving person who is redeemable in you. And you prove me wrong. You know, every man seems like he sacrifices in your presence. Always serving you. He has to make you comfortable and happy. It's ingrained in him by his society. That your self centered happiness and comfort is his responsibility and his priority. And what a strange cretin you must be to live in an environment like that all the time. I know there are "creeps" mixed in who actually feel pain when you treat them like shit, and there are manipulative types you pretend you hate. I don't know why we're all still in this farce. You don't even LIKE men who are nice to you, let alone love them, and yet they are coerced and mentally subverted into being so anyway. Marriage is dead. Love is dying. Most men are prisoners. Women are awful and dream of siding with the jailors. You might aswell anyway side with evil. 

You're fucking useless anyway. You don't cook, clean, knit, in the office you're not especially productive but your presence makes the room notably hostile and oppressive to all men. And that money you do steal from your more qualified, and better applicants that should have been doing your job you waste on yourself. A man makes money and shares it with women frequently. A woman is a special kind of the most self centered and amoral character that the goodwill is always one way. This is all to say that you have no real good for anyone. You live for yourself and are entitled to live in a world where everyone around you has to make you comfortable and you have always been a misery people grit their teeth with because they believe they should. Because they believe they are supposed to like you for no good fucking reason. By fiat. And that the whole situation only goes one way.

I never worked in an office, but when I was a grocery retail and food service wagecuck women were very empathetic, and they would hug me all the time, like long close heartwarming hugs. I'm no chad either, women were just nice to me. The only times I got teased and bullied it was by male coworkers. Without some women around to look at and talk to, I wouldn't have any motivation to get through work or school.

Though I do wonder what it was like for that one monk who literally never saw a woman in his life. His mother died giving birth to him, and then he was raised in an isolated monastery on a remote island, or peninsula in Greece, I forgot.

I'm the Food Truck Fag who has been posting here for the past few months. I have a massive catering order for a local military base. 150 burritos. Due May 15th, at 10:30. Not small ones either. These are 13 inch tortillas. I'm suspending operations for the morning of since this is just a massive order. I'd like your opinions of the entire situation, so I'll lay out the facts first.

>found the military contractor on Boomerbook (sadly its the best in my area) when they were in search of a food truck for catering the base in person
>drove out about a year ago
>served a fuck ton of tacos
>charged them way more than I would charge a normal business
>despite this, they said that my prices were the lowest they ever had, and would remain in touch
>few months pass
>get a call from my contact there.
>"Hey Anon, we would like to place an order for pickup in two weeks. 50 Burritos"
>since I was still starting out, said yes immediately
>week before was stocking up and laying out plans to make the process as efficient as possible
>wake up at 11:00pm with 4 hours of sleep
>slam the fuck out of burritos
>work fast
>work hard
>finish the order only 30 mins before pickup
>smoke a joint and see a movie with a fuckton of taxpayer cash
>ff last week
>get called by my contact
>she wants 150 burritos
>3x the size of the previous order
>holy fuck
>since my engine broke down, I was unironically scraping by
>peanutbutter dinners
>say yes
>realize after all the order details are finalized and I send her the invoice, I might be fucked
>I have the funds for the project, but will be working for over 12 hours straight
>I'm gonna be so fucked up

How can I take the edge off this situation? The due date is May 5th. I've planned everything down to the minute, and have already stocked most of the product.

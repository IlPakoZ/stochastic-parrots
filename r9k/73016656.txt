Is it normal for a bisexual guy not being interested in topping men? I enjoy mutual blowjobs and the occasional ass playing if I'm too horny but nothing more. If I want to penetrate I highly prefer a cis woman. Although I have topped some transwomen in the past.

PS: And I recognize I can see myself topping a femboy due to their submissive womanly features but I'm not actively looking for that and they are actually rare, even more rare than the trannies.

No matter how you look at it, you're still a faggot

I know I'm a (bi)fag, but that wasn't the question.

You have a fetish called autogynephilia.

There are far more bisexuals than gays though.

In a similar category with regards to men. Almost dont want to do sex stuff outside of oral with feminime looking guys/troons. Penetration and the idea of cumming via prostate sounds hot, but I then I get closer to be able to do it and think about it, then I'm filled with disgust. It's probably my porn rotted brain, but oh well

It's always weird how some guys foam at the mouth with the "y-youre gay!" line, even when you already admit it to them. You say you're bi and they start telling you how gay you are lol. I mean, duh...

>More than 60 percent of young men are single, nearly twice the rate of unattached young women, signaling a larger breakdown in the social, romantic and sexual life of the American male. Men in their 20s are more likely than women in their 20s to be romantically uninvolved, sexually dormant, friendless and lonely

Cool thanks for the update. I must have forgotten it after seeing this posted 30 times an hour on every 4chan board for the last few weeks. Appreciate it and knowing this data is surely useful and not just a worthless datapoint intended to demoralize people.
I'm a married sex haver btw, and when the time comes, some normal person like me is going to put you and your family in a gas chamber and watch you die btw.
Good night.

See? It has nothing to do with genetics or how many available single men or women there are. For fucking years you dipshit incels cried about there being more men than women and that leftover men were just caused by gender ratios. This data debunks that. If you want to date, you will always be able to date someone, even if they dont exist. 95% of women are dating someone that is not dating anyone. Based

Genuinely curious because its strange that there isn't one listed and I don't want this being used to manipulate the weak men on this board.

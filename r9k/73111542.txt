Whenever women do this I assume it's fear and they're trying to placate me because they're scared I'm going to unless my sperg rage on them.

you are probably right

TFW women rarely stare at me and when they do, they never smile or talk. They give me nothing to go with.
I get likes and matches online, but they never speak, let alone want to fuck. The curse of the averagecel.

but this wasn't a polite awkard smile, she kept eyeballing me and smiling with her eyes. Like her eyes were crinkling and her head was craning (she is smol) as she passed me.

i have a even harder time discerning women's looks, I'm asian in a predominately white area. Girls sometimes eyeball me, I never know if its curiosity or a invitation to talk to them.

Why are ugly asian girls so much cuter than ugly white girls?
--- 73111902
if they hold eye contact and move their head to keep it while you walk past them, then yea, they find you attractive

No one can guarantee you anything but that's more than enough reason to approach.

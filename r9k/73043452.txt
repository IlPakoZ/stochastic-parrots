Guys this is an emergency, how do I make the knot in my chest go away? I just want to go to sleep without thinking about how I will die alone

You have a sinful nature. You know what you want.

No, I'm too young still. I will kill myself when I reach the ripe age of 30 if things don't improve

Why do you care about dying alone?

Because it implies living alone. I don't want to be alone :(

Why does it matter how you die? Do what you can in live, take what enjoyment there is to take. Don't obsess over things such as loneliness. Sure, it hurts and it will keep hurting, but it won't hurt as much if you stop obsessing over it.
At least that's what worked for me. Best of luck

Turn onto your left side
Breath in an out 10 times
Think to yourself I can do this.
Think of all the girls or boys that you can make friends with and build a relationship with 
close your eyes and say I am never alone when I have /r9k/
Go to sleep and dream

night night

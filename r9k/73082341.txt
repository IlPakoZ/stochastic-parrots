Dead bitches edition.

I'm tired of you fucking faggots and your constant vigilance for reasons to act like a gang. You want to be a gang so bad, then you can get treated like a gang, starting with how no one gives a shit when one of you dies.
--- 73082366
As though half you hypocrites didn't go around badmouthing him your stupid ass selves. The main difference is that, when I do it, it's justified.

And if you don't realize that then you don't know what you're talking about, and you should suck my dick and then fuck off.
--- 73082375
And you should also all kill yourselves. Make the world a better place, and die. No need to stop with the one asshole.
--- 73082398
>>73082341 (OP)
hahaha gringo you'll never be a Tyrone from the hood, you'll never be a part of a gang and u mad bout it
--- 73082440
>>73082398
I would *love* to see you try to survive in the hood. Tyrone would push your shit in every single day of your pussy ass life.
--- 73082467
>>73082440
Nah cracker, Tyrone is out here lettin me fuck him in da ass, that's how loved I am by da hood
--- 73082488
I would *love* to see *any* of you try to survive in an environment where nonstop, full-blown, vindictive faggotry isn't backstopped by a bunch of gestapo powertripping. What's pathetic is how you end up looking like clowns even when it is. You should really all kill yourselves. Die. Leave the planet so it sucks less. Go away, from reality, forever, please.
--- 73082513
>>73082488
Nice dubs, but nah I'm here to stay.
--- 73082545
I hope you get your wish some day. I hope someone takes the bait and just beats the everliving shit out of you.

You should really worry that I don't, though. And you can interpret that however you want.
--- 73082585
Oh and another thing:
All of your children are little shitstain faggots, and they'll probably die young from being retarded and having losers as parents. Fuck them too.
--- 73082596
>>73082545
How about we take this back to when you didn't want to kick my ass? Remember those days?
--- 73082673
>>73082596
That's like telling a gay dude "remember when you were straight?"
--- 73083259
The worst part is knowing you don't care.
Everything that happened, you lashing out at me, closing things off so suddenly.
But you not caring hurts more, you know?
I would understand if there was more, more blaming me, more sadness, more... more anything really?
An apology would have been the best, still would be... but at this point I'll take blame, I'll take ANY kind of reaction.
But you don't care and that sucks so much more than if you were toxic about it.

Nothing's gonna change, at best I'll get baited into having a pang in my heart by some bots or other sad sacks like me thinking I'm their special someone.
I just wish you cared more about me, I wish there was any kind of... anything, for me, that I had a bit more importance.
I don't think anyone enjoy feeling disposable.

Still miss you like you wouldn't believe, I think everyday about what it could've been.
I'd say more but pretending that you're also in these threads, looking for signs of me, gives me a very bland sense of happiness.
--- 73083735
Stop psyopping me to want a gf. I don't want a gf. I don't ever want a gf.
--- 73083753
I don't want friends. I don't want any of that. It's never worked and it will never work. I want to improve myself, leave society and never return.

--- 73083920
>>73083259
I know this feel Anon. It's devastating when we mean nothing to someone who means so much to us. Even negative attention from them wouldn't hurt as much as complete indifference. 

But I think it's best to stop thinking of them. Best to stop hoping. Better to accept and move on. We can't change things with them, but we can still do what's best for ourselves in the long run

Indigenous people of North America will establish a country and return home from exile.
By following The Way, by being strong and courageous, to return the the right path of perseverance. They will be prosperous and multiply, sons will find wives and daughters will find husbands.

The natives will cease their wicked ways in a day and take land, not by might, not by power or the strength, courage, or intelligence of this World, but by The Spirit of The Lord.

I miss my friend.

--- 73089334
Your love , short as it was , ruined me beyond recognition
The feeling was never mutual , the passion was a one sided fantasy I was high on. 
In another world , perhaps , it could work but in this one we are destined to be alone.
whatever happens though I wont stop.
I so desperately wanted to die in your arms but now the only death remaining for me is in complete solitude therefore I'll continue to move forward even if it ruins me.
--- 73089763
You were always a little out of my reach.

The years go by, and we still find each other attractive through thick and thin. I always come back to wanting you when my heart is crushed or when I set someone free because I can't love them properly.

I wish you cared about me beyond just a side piece to sext when you don't feel too guilty. I would do anything for you.
--- 73089899
>>73087938

--- 73090169
I tought I was improving, up and at em, had it all sorted out and I'd be over you in no time. I was feeling a bit euphoric even. Made plans to replace you in no time and jump straight into the dating scene again. Figured I'd have some setbacks along the way, 3 steps forward and 1 step back, but nothing mayor.

Now I feel like it's all coming updone. I come home from work and crawl straight into bed. I'm starting to feel like I overestimated myself. I feel lost, uncertain of what I want or who I am. And even though you explained clearly why we were not working out I feel as if I still don't get it. I will still question why.
--- 73090235
I'm going to ask nicely: please stop spying on me.
--- 73090455
>>73090235
K kinda bored with it anyways
--- 73090520
>>73090455
Alright. Good. No cheating.
--- 73090583
>>73090169
i felt like this too but it never works out. and then the other person gets over you and it sucks
--- 73090708
>>73090583
What never works out? Getting over them?
--- 73090794
>>73090708
yeah. having these plans to improve and be over the other person. its just cope essentially lol
--- 73090899
>>73090794
Well that sucks. So I really did lose huh. I lost when they slowly checked out, I lost when they dumped me and I'll lose at moving on as well. Just a big loser all around.
--- 73091799
i never should have gotten involved with a degenerate whore like you let alone gave a shit about you. what a waste of time for nothing but a damaged heart. different my ass you women are all the same. claim to want to help but all you do is damage further by your inability to control your feelings or impulses. you can't help yourself let alone anybody else. my feelings are reserved for me from now on as they should be
--- 73091850
I want to leave bite marks on your ass. Sit on my face and suffocate me
--- 73092159
I aspire to become a professional phlebotomist so I can draw your blood whilst you are unconscious and consume your essence. I want you inside of me.
--- 73092176
Let me fuck your ass raw then
--- 73092254
Hey, sorry but you insisting that I stay in your life is fucking torture, I feel bad for you, but you're just untrustworthy, and emotionally weak enough that any man can string you along into cheating, I know we're cousins, but you know damn well that the things we did as teens meant something, I am so fucking repulsed by the autistic orbiters you keep around and the notion that you think that I'd join them orbiting you makes me want to strangle you.
--- 73092438
>>73092254
Also your hatred for female friendships because it's "just a bunch of drama" is 100% a result of no woman being comfortable with having your loose self around any man they're interested in.

I have a very strong libido but even I am made uncomfortable by what a large part of your life sex plays.
--- 73092452
>>73090235
It's not like I have a camera looking at you or anything, surely me being on the lookout isn't too bad~

i have nothing to say to you right now. i'm skipping dinner plans at your place. something in the air or in the cosmos has me pissed off at you. something about how little you've been texting me recently, how you went into heat and hornytexted me, didn't follow through with it and didn't ask me to come over. i don't like how you've been treating me. i don't think you deserve dinner with me. you'll get silence

Why so Anon y
--- 73097803
Dear A,

I don't like you anymore, it's simple as that. Our relationship has been, or is revealing itself to be nothing more than a puddle's depth, and antithetical in all aspects except for whom we share friends with. I am on the comedown from the worst emotional episode I have ever experienced and we happened to get together right at its peak. And although I'm thankful to have had you around to help me through it and help me understand who I want to be, I can only conclude, and feel for a future that doesn't involve you.
I don't like your attitude towards personal growth; your dependencies on modern psychological treatment and the way you act like every problem you have can be solved by taking more meds; your inactivity; and I especially hate your adoption and participation in transgender ideology. I have never believed in any of these things that you take to the absolute core of your worldview. I did, however, create a caricature of what I thought I wanted to be, and what I thought you wanted. In this, I have been terrible to you. But I am trying to fall back into what I want, and I can't help but feel repulsed by the thing I tried to be for you. And now I'm acting out as you seem to have become the amalgamation of that character. We get into petty fights and I struggle to find reason to keep burning gas to see you, which I do less with each passing week. We aren't talking, doing anything fun, and I don't think we do anything to complement each other anymore.
All that said, and I don't properly think anything less of you, and I certainly don't regret the past 21 months we've been together. But I will regret any further time we spend in this shallow relationship, and I don't want to hurt you anymore than I have before.
Really, I just want to be alone for a few months...

- C

hits close to home for me and likely a lot of others, sounds like a typical zoomette bpd cunt, only difference is she couldn't damage my heart if she tried because i see her for what she is. and yeah, women all think they're "the good one" or the exception to the rule when in actual fact they're carbon copies of all the other stupid sluts in the world, retarded bitches who use websites like this in particular could all be clones of each other and it wouldn't make any difference.

--- 73099813
I'm glad I don't think or care about you much anymore. I almost killed myself because of what you did to me, not like you would care, and frankly I would never want you to know that. If there's one silver lining of what you did to me, it made me stop idealizing women. Other than that I want you to keep fading from my memory until you're just a shitty paragraph in my life instead of a chapter or even the end.

I'm a random guy in another country so if that makes you uncomfortable that I can find a random google review possibly from you then I dunno what you're hoping to achieve doxing this guy talking as if he's in this thread, if this guy is that much of a nemesis to you you should probably find a different outlet for this, and don't take that as going all fisher king on him or anything ok, if it's financial and you've taken a blow or something at this guy's gain and you've already sought legal options then find a levelled outcome that doesn't involve you ruminating over it like this cause you post about this guy having ruined your life a lot

Dearest 'm',

We haven't written to each other in awhile; I hope the smut (that is, low quality) of this place hasn't deterred you away. It wouldn't be very nice for you to depart without us adding each other off site. Not that I was hoping for that or anything. I would never come off way-too-forward and ask to exchange contact info. That would be something else.
It's probably taboo to mention, but I have a hunch you lurk this place too, and like me, probably respond to random initial-less posts, thinking it's from me to you. It's only taboo because I'd look silly if this wasn't the case, but I don't particularly mind. When effort posting, there's only so many ways of wording something until you can tell it's uniquely from one person. Anyways.
I hope you make another post so we can write to each other for the day. It'd be nice to talk to you again.

Dear ___,

I miss you a ton. When you're ready to move on, I'll be here to provide you with the life you always wanted and then some.

There are just certain boundaries I can't break until then.
--- 73106103
Eight hate vibes and a dozen cigarettes later and you're ready to leave me for that daddy fuckier scoundrel. Like she will do anything but to rape me more and again. I'm glad I had her locked away or intimidated into alienation. She was never anything but an imposer, I just want you to be mine before I could ever do anything. Just be good like god intended. Jealous is zealous against self-sacrifice and that's what she is against my straying. You know I love you like cupid's arrow has struck me and she can't do that. Idiots unlike you are not even worth saying hello to to be frank. Stop trying to make me compete and keep your options open so she can get her foot back in the door and be my unwanted wench. You better come home and realize that your place is in holy matrimony to me following a breakdown of impeding factors that prevent our love. Teach the world that we're in love. I still need you more than anything. Just stay safe and see me when the world will allow. I love you forever, you know who you are, let's please have more babies, I can't fight this feeling anymore

If humans could understand things they've never seen before without communicating I'm sure we would still see eachother like we did on your last birthday I loved that night and you were so happy to be mine in that moment I know we'll see eachother sooner than later

Dear ___,
You finally did it, once again I was right about you. Setting aside my doubts for three months while you tried to change. Telling me, your biggest regret was to be the same person you once were. Maybe it's time I separate myself from you to savor the faint beautiful spark you were trying to grow. Maybe this is selfish but ending this off with hating you would destroy my soul just as much as yours has. Maybe until the next life. I wish to not remanence on how you described yourself. Goodbye, until then.

The more time apart, the more I've realized how unaccepable your treatment of me has been. I do not keep people like you in my life.

Too little too late.
But little implies there was something to begin with.
Stop deluding yourself, you're too old to be someone after a lifetime of not taking care of yourself.
I'm not that far ahead compared to you but at least I've been keeping myself afloat, how many medicines do you need just to have the motivation to make coffee in the morning?
A lesson I'm being taught again and again, which somehow I failed to learn with you, is that the marginalized are often marginalized for a reason: I've used to be patient with your foul behavior and twisted mentality but maybe I should've told you how disgusting you really are and blocked you right away.
So be it: you're gross and vile, disgusting, you fetishize who hurts you and mock those that genuinely want you good, even if they're clumsy in their ways.
You would rather hang out with possible criminals rather than give up your sickness and stick with people who's greatest fault may be social ineptitude.
You've stuck with a sick, foul person who did nothing but abuse and use you for years and defended him at the expense of your own happiness, only to be tossed out like the trash you are, because he could see you for the piece of cancerous radioactive shit that you are and he had nothing out to squeeze from you.
You've hurt me.

It isn't cute, it isn't funny.
In an already cruel and unloving world, you add more pain, to yourself and others.
You're out of friends: the people with you stick because you're relevant to their interests, because you feed them content.
What will happen when you'll be out of energy for such things?
You'll be like your idol was: stuck with you.
Will you toss yourself in the trash too, as he did?

It's too late for you: did too little, too late and it was all to put others down, not to put yourself up.
Wherever you wanted or not, you're an adult now.
To act like a child now will only make you a creep.

I am glad your gaslighting and insulting is getting to me less now. I still have to carry the weight but the load feels lighter. I am gaining back some weight for my health and no longer feel as paranoid. I realized recently how history repeated itself and how I had been treated similarly before about 9 years back by a guy with a similar name. I was sexually used then discarded by an older guy then insulted and made to feel deeply ashamed of myself while the guy ignored me to the best of his ability. I felt like I was drowning trying to figure out what was going on then too. Never getting an explanation made it so I couldn't figure out what was going on then too and it not only made it much harder to move on but to make proper choices. I did things I regret then too. My body isn't a toy. I am not a toy. Being treated as one by someone I deeply loved as a completely unloved child broke me. It's funny how striking it is, the similarities, down to the names.
--- 73125261
There were some differences, though, like when my controlling parents reported me "missing" for no reason he looked for me. I think he valued my life on some level even if he disliked me at the time. Also he didn't ever pretend to love me; I just thought that was what him having me touch his penis meant. Even closing in on a decade later, an apology would still mean a lot from him; from you, it would be life changing. Is that why you don't give one?

--- 73125493

not the former, but the latter is cute. only issue is the moment you love her back she moves on from you. which is a dilemma for sure
--- 73125540
>>73125493
That doesn't happen for me. Only one man I ever loved agreed to a relationship and he tore my heart to shreds just like the other woman he dated who loved him dearly. Yes we both left him but he could be so degrading it took a toll on us and he refused to change his communication even slightly. Also, not that I am owed sex, but we never once fucked and my drive is high. I really would have done anything to stay with him if we were even a little bit compatible. I wanted to marry him forever.
--- 73125571

Do you know what "forever" means, sweetie?
--- 73125579
>>73125540
ah, I tried. I was trying to make up a scenario so you'd attribute that distasteful behavior to him and you'd move on but it didn't seem to work. not sure if your name is spelled with a C or K. hope you can move on though, been reading your trauma loops on here for awhile now. be well
--- 73125732
>>73125571
Okay, I wanted to marry him forever conditional on him not treating me like an inferior and putting himself above me constantly while never fucking me. He wouldn't comply so I didn't continue trying to marry him. Happy?

>>73125579
It is. I have been here for I believe 7+ years, on and off. Different styles and such. Limerence is to cptsd what alcoholism is to regular ptsd.

Dear Greg O

You stole shit from me and sold it. You had Dennis physically assault me and wound him up to attack me for your own amusement. You constantly invaded my privacy and always crossed my boundaries. I had no personal space and you perpetually made my life worse. You made chores more difficult to accomplish, you claimed territory that wasn't yours and pulled mental gymnastics to explain away your terrible behavior. I was trying very hard to live a quiet life and keep to myself but you wouldn't allow that and you drove me insane. I hope you get what's coming for you because you're a terrible ugly coward.

I have written many letters to you but I never send them. I have so many things to say to you until I realize that I really don't, and I think that's why we haven't talked in so long, everything else aside. It's not that I'm leaving things unsaid, it's that those things don't quite "fit", they're inappropriate and unnecessary. A long time ago we reached a point where no further interaction could take place and we were both supposed to go our separate ways like we never met. And that's what I did. I knew, and still know, that it was the right course of action, and I hate that to this day. I hope it was easier on your end. This is starting to feel inappropriate too so I'll stop typing now.

Where did you go? I used to see you every time I went down the main street, drinking in one of the bars like clockwork. Did you stop drinking? Did you move? I wanna know what happened but I don't want to unblock you to find out. As shitty as you were to me, I hope you can get help for your alcoholism before it's too late. You'd be 31 now, you're too old to be getting fuck eyed every night. The liver cirrhosis is closer than you realise. I really hope you made it and you aren't waking up in piss soaked sheets anymore. Remember when you shit on my bedroom floor and tried to blame it on my dog (who was outside)? Remember when you gave me all that meth that you said was MD and we played Uno for 48hrs on the balcony while your friend sobbed about that dog he killed when he was high? I really got my life together after I broke up with you. I never had a problem with drinking, but I gave it up anyway because it reminded me of you. You were a fucking disaster. I should have called an ambulance when you took all that acid and drank all those beer and did all those lines and were nodding and rolling your eyes and drooling. Your poor brain. 

Anyway. Hope you sorted your life out. Don't ever message me again.

Rebecca,

To this day you are the most compassionate and kind individual that i have ever known. You have set for me the standard of greatness that i strive one day to achieve. Yet the memory of you is also a source of my deepest regret as i will never allow myself to foget all the ways in which i have failed you. It is your memory that keeps me going every day. Our brief time together a reminder that no matter how bad things seem.... something wonderful and life changing could be just around the corner.

I iwsh that i could be there to see you at your happiest but i dont deserve that. I cant return to you the degree of enrichment that you bring to my life. I would do anything I could to help you but i cant do what should be the easiest thing in the world. Im sorry. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life for a brief moment. It was a lot of fun.

-Max

I still miss you. I'm also glad you ghosted me. It was doomed from the start. We were better off parting ways sooner rather than later.

I cant say that i regret it all. I got to make good on at least one of my promises but for the most part...

How many more failed relationships will it take for you to realize you're inherently broken as a person?
--- 73133127
>>73133116
I'm not trying to have new relationships I'm trying to save the ones that dissappeared so that no one has to be broken

Hoping for that divinity behind the words.
That echoes something meaningful.

Yourself.

I'm pretty sure if everyone's personal shit got leaked everywhere -- like everything they're up to -- the results would be pretty hysterical in terms of who is really a "good guy" vs "bad guy." Really quite positive.

I just wanted to conduct an affair. You are being so criminal and I wish you'd wake up and realize that I want NOTHING else to do with you than a few quick fucks and to deny your stupid plans. I just don't want to be your monkey wrench anymore and I'm not a floozy, I'm the antonym. I was yours and waited for you for years. I am yours and you keep trying to give me away. I am just horny and in need of a type of respect that you will never give me because you think I'm subhuman. Your own admission. I am really beginning to hate you and want to commit suicide for the way that you climb on top of everyone and have no regard for my sexual needs. I am not a toy for an invalid. I will never be anything but a regretful suitor that regrets his relationships and life unless you change and stop pimping. I do not want to settle on an idiot for the final time. Stop trying to make me please. Just come home and realize that your hatred and greed is taking over with a vengeance and you are asking too much from a simple man. I just wanted you to be crazy about me and I'm little more than an afterthought and a victim to you.

Trying to save...? Remind me again why you failed in first place. You're a shit person at core, stop trying to keep torturing the poor souls that had the misfortune of meeting you.

Nah, this big clusterfuck is all about judging you, not me. Bet.

You are unfunny I just want to be happy I just don't want her to suffer like everyone else that betrayed me I've watched people crumble from doing such awful things and leaving people that truly cared for them I just want understanding and safety and for good things to happen I'm so tired of how this world has been when I love her so much and when every single person I meet ends up running themselves into the ground when they burn everyone around them I'm full of scars and I'm in love with her and I'll keep trying my best for her

Big ass arca concert. Blotted in the parking lot. Doing meth everywhere and screaming out the n word. He thinks he can just show his penis to anyone he wants. He loves to eat ass due to a vitamin deficiency. Allegedly. *snaps fingers*

ok i guess its pretty clear you want nothing to do with me besides mutually assured destruction so ill just go away now. i wish we could have been friends even if it was just for awhile but youd clearly rather slit your throat than be near me for a second. 

narcissists really do just take all their drama to the grave. dont say i didnt try

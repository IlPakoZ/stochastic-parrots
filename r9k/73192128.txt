This! A mosque would take you in temporarily that is for sure! I even pretended to be a new muslim and received a meal a day for free. Back in 2010 I was kicked out from home after me dad died, mom dont like me so I got kicked out with zero dollars. I got a job as a streetcleaner an hour's walk away from the mosque. For 6 months I stayed in the mosque. Got enough capital and finally rented a room and then a studio a year later. Be strong! You can do it!

Homelessness ain't that bad, I would get a sturdy backpack to prepare and a small combination lock to lock it up to prevent stealing. If you can sing or play an instrument, busking is at least a way to "earn" money. There are also temp labor companies. I don't suggest begging, as that becomes a habit you can get stuck into very quick, use only at most desperate. Public Libraries will be your sanctuary, a source of free wifi and restrooms, as well as books to save you from boredom. Keep any money hidden, and do not pack a weapon. If you really want a weapon, prepare yourself a brick-less millwall brick, which serves as a nice baton. Avoid other homeless people. Note where your local churches and food banks are so you can get some food. If you have any money from busking or begging or other similar activities, have your clothes cleaned at a laundromat or something similar. There are also free public showers sometimes near you, take advantage of those.

For what you need:
>Backpack
>Small combo lock
>A few pairs of dry clean socks
>Good pair of shoes
>A hat that can protect from sun exposure
>Beanie for warmth when needed
>Jacket for the cold and windchill
>Pair of gloves
>Mobile device for internet access 
>Charger for mobile device
>Sunscreen
>Wet wipes
>Vaseline
>Small first aid kit
>Facemask
>Small reusable towel or hand rag
>Multivitamins so you aren't deficient 
>Hand sanitizer
>Hairbrush
>Nail clippers
>Rolled up tarp or blanket 
>Tissue or roll of toilet paper(note you can just use public restrooms, but having a roll can be useful)
>Can opener
>Flashlight 
>Sewing kit
>Spork or a set of utensils
>Ziploc bags
>Any spare plastic bags
>A pack of saltine crackers or other snack to chew on when severely hungry
>Water bottle or hydro flask filled with water
>Religious book, can be the bible, can be Bhagavad Gita, whatever
>Millwall brick made of newspaper(optional)

Ask for a serious talk, and be honest with them. 
Tell them everything you were hiding from them till now, every issue you have, every shortcoming you can't face, every insecurity, don't hide anything. They need to face the reality that they FAILED to raise you. 

And them after all that, tell them that if you move out you will kill yourself and it'll be their fault.

Also, if you still can, joining a military branch is still a thing. Don't need to join the army, national guard or navy or air force will do. It'll help you save up and buy above gear for when you're out of the military and still homeless.

Also, you can use military as an excuse for postponing you getting kicked out. I don't know if it would work, but you can possibly tell your folks that you're deciding to join the military, but you want to study for the ASVAB, as well as gain enough physical fitness to actually get past basic. Actually do this shit anyways though.

Damn dude that sucks

I'm late 20s Latino and live at home still

I work remotely and give them a couple hundred for rent but I want to fucking move out eventually 

The problem is that I'm clueless when it comes to these things, I overthink everything

I'm thinking of just saying fuck it and getting a higher paying remote job and living for cheap in a big Mexican city with a decent expat/digital nomad population, I have to look into getting dual citizenship 

There's a guy called digitalbromad that lives in different countries for a bit and just travels while working remote as a data analyst 

I wish you the best

I had a similar situation, lived in a homeless shelter for 3 years (I'm still living there at 20) 

I'm currently getting ready though to move out of state and into an apartment on my own. Just keep your head up and remember to go at your own place, both of us have a whole lives ahead of us but most importantly remember that sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you can dig your way back up. Wishing you the best.

Some kf these things you'll likely already have, things like the Millwall brick can be made for free from those public ad papers. Id also suggest a flashdrive filled with survival pdfs and other such info that you can read while on public library computers.

Why don't you just get a job? Any job will do ATM. I was a weirdo like you when I was 18, quiet and shy and never had any friends (still don't). I had to man up and get a job or suffer the consequences and die alone. Now I'm 20 and I'd say in a somewhat better position, I'm definitely more sarcastic and talkative than before though.

Well for one I haven't left my house in weeks and I only go outside at 2 am. But even if I could get enough motivation to overcome my social anxiety whats the point of getting a job if I'll be homeless in 1 week. 

I don't have a car too so I gotta walk 4 miles to get to anywhere with jobs.

Well tell that to your parents, that's a good excuse to not have a job. Maybe they'll think of someone who can help with that.
--- 73192694
OP, remember, if you do gather some of the supplies the list above at home, do so discreetly. You may be accused of stealing and be booted out even quicker. I also recommend having a razor and shave gel if you want to keep clean shaven, and a body spray of some sport to be saved for when you get stinky.

If you are able to land a job, you can use the funds to get a dirt cheap gym membership in order to use the showers and facilities.you can also buy better quality food which can help in you getting /fit/. Getting /fit/ also helps with survival, it can help with intimidation of potential muggers or crazy homeless people.

>>73192625
>Too socially anxious to get a job or even leave the house

You realize that if you go homeless, you're literally gonna have to spend the ENTIRE day outside of the safety of your room, where people can see you, JUDGE you, and laugh at you for being homeless? You can't even just hide in your tent all day because you'll have to come out eventually to beg OTHER PEOPLE for money. Your inaction has been a jump from out of the frying pan into the fire, and quite frankly, I don't even know why you bothered to make this thread.

You're obviously gonna have to kill yourself now, especially as you don't want to take any of the options right in front of you. You fucked up anon, and now it's too late. Your fear of fucking up has led to one big, monumental fuck up and you can't do anything about it except face the consequences.

Milfag anon here. The covid shot is no longer mandatory. That said you'll still get jabbed with god knows what in order to make you deployable. You'll get the basic stuff and then more depending on if they want to send you overseas or not because brown people and mosquitos are dangerous.

If I was in that situation I would do something horrific to my parents. In your situation, kicking you out is basically the same as killing you. Before you do anything, keep in mind they're trying to kill you. The people who were supposed to prepare you for life have instead decided to kill you

Apply for remote jobs. Apps like LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter and Kijiji have "remote only" checkboxes. So if you're in the US you can apply to jobs in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, wherever you want
Strong keywords for searching include "Inbound" "outbound" "remote". Data entry has gotten me a bunch of phishing emails and Indian men wanting me to download WhatsApp for job interviews, so watch out for those.
CaIl centre jobs are high turnover and entry level so you don't need a degree.
Your first call centre job might be in an office before some other company trusts you to work at home

I was like you. I didn't get my license until I was 21 and was mostly a NEET out of highschool.

I was lucky, I was kicked out of my grandpa's house that was empty (rich family) because I told the Coast Guard recruiters that I did DMT, LSD, Salvia, and Mushrooms, as well as had recurring suicidal thoughts. My grandpa was furious.

Because I got my license right before I got kicked out, I was able to live in my grandpa's old car for a little while, I even got a girlfriend for a little bit that worked at Dunkin Donuts. She didn't have a license, so she would give me gas money and let me crash at her house and I would drive her to work and other places, sometimes drive her friends around. 

Life is full of possibilities, I won't deny I was fortunate but I got my first girlfriend because I just got a license and saw a girl I went to highschool with (who had a boyfriend) needed a ride to work the day before Christmas.

I can't suggest too much as your situation is more severe. Getting a license and scraping together enough money by any means necessary for a shitbox to sleep in (prob like $2000, I got cars for less but that was several years ago now) is your best hope I'd say.

You don't have any family member or friend to stay with them for a while? 

I don't know maybe your parents are trying to scare you. My parents threatened me with kicking me out many times, may father told me many times that I had to be out of the house before he returned in a copule of days but then he didn't do it. I have a sister to stay with though so is not as bad as you. But maybe your parents kick you out and in a couple of days they change their mind or they don't even do it. You have to be a very shitty person to kick your son out just because he has psychological problems and can't have a job, knowing that he will be sleeping on the streets and have no one to stay with. If my parents do that to me they would be immediately erased of my mind as parents. I wouldn't care about them anymore. They would have to apologize and show me that they regret what they did and maybe I would forget them. But even then if I have been a long time on the streets I think things would never be the same with them. I mean you have to be a fucking psychopath to leave your son on the streets while you are in your house sleeping. The only reason I see as logical to kick a son out is if he is attacking you and is a crazy drug addict. But not because he just have mental problems and can't have a job.

Unironically this is the correct response. Parents like these deserve the grief of their child ending their life, make it very clear that either you get to stay or the blood will be on their hands.

My parents kicked me out at 17. Luckily I had a retail wagie full time at the job and had met some other similar retards working there so had a place to stay to get back on track. I'd say ask your parents to let you get a little bit of training or job and drivers license + car + a little savings

It's an Anglo thing. My parents would mock the Chinese and Lebanese here for treating their sons like "little princes". Meanwhile my dad forced me to work nights twenty hours a week in high school as "earning money is the best education" and then booted me out.

Check online right away for any place looking for any place looking for a smalltime tenant and explain the situation, sometimes people are cool with taking a delayed payment as long as you're good for it, just don't count on it being guaranteed (it's not). If you have no career prospects set up, get a resume together asap and grab something simple like stock, retail or washing dishes. I had the exact same problem as you, though I lucked out and found a place that needed a roommate before I moved out and knew where I was gonna live.

That's the brutal nature of life. Normies who get kicked out of their house have formulated and strengthened the bond between them and their friends to an extent they trust them being at their house. People like anon are thus the vulnerable and get brutally punished in life. 

I suppose anon you will have to lay out a strategy to overcome your biggest obstacle yet. You have a choice to give up or to fight through it. It's up to you, if it were me and there was a way out as I can foresee it then I would fight back and forever remember this .

Exactly this. It is the objective truth. Kicking out someone with no savings or connections is literally murder. OP should kill his parents asap in a violent manner. Hopefully he comes to his senses and realizes the gravity of his situation and does the right thing.

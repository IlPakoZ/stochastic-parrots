Woke up feeling horrible again. I am just waiting to die at this point.
Can someone (anyone) reassure me that it is going to be ok? That i will find happiness one day? To tell me it's not my fault and that i didn't choose to be born like this. 
 or bully me into suicide, that works too. Just make it stop please

Set your alarm for 3pm 
Get up and do a little push ups and sit-ups,
Go make some tea and go for a small walk around the areas.
At 7am watch some news and morning , take some vitamins in the morning and plan your day

Go out into the world and see what is happening

>>73161110 (OP)
Staying online all day or night will not help you mentally, go out and spend time hiking or camping, get back to nature and explore the world
Find an hobby that is outside and see if you can concentrate on other activities, you like everyone else can beat your pain

YOU CAN DO THIS!!

>>73161110 (OP)
it actually is going to be ok if you can believe that

I'm sure you're real fucked up and all but the good part about being real fucked up is it usually means the worst, as in the horrible confusing out of your hands stuff, is mostly over, and now you're supposed to figure out how you can be how you are to the absolute best benefit to yourself the people you love and the ever ahead of us higher ideas of better ways of the things we are indentured to as human bodies and minds and hearts, but it's probably going to call for a simultaneous attaining of a thicker skin and thinner gut if you hear me

also this >>73161133, there is some truth in not going off too far mentally into the big wild when you're lonely because it can make you not only feel but be far more isolated emotionally, but it's even truer that you should actually be looking at beautiful things in the world that out of nature exist on scales of material and time both fleeting to your own life and immovable and seemingly eternal

Thanks anon. I'm not a morning person and i workout tho
>>73161133
Thanks! I hate the outdoors but i do like long walks in isolated areas and biking. I will try to do that more.
>concentrate
Heh, i can barely concentrate on anything. My mind is always all over the place. Most likely add

Life fucking sucks but being dead is probably worse. You'll find something to live for eventually I guess. Just drag yourself through every day with the rest of us.

>>73161176
it was very nice of you to make this, I hope op sees it and gets a little serotonin boost
--- 73161247
>>73161110 (OP)
Everything is gonna be ok anon. Just keep moving forward and you'll make it through this. I'm sure some great opportunities will pop up for you in the future.
--- 73161253
>>73161154
Woah, a long one :O
>it actually is going to be ok if you can believe that
Uninically. Noe i believe that! Hard part is believeing it is going to be ok, as you probably know. The odds are stacked against me and i have nothing i trully enjoy. 
You make a lot of sense anon
>and now you're supposed to figure out how you can be how you are to the absolute best benefit to yourself the people you love
I don't have anyone i love now. I am also bitter. I try to help others if they ask tho
>there is some truth in not going off too far mentally into the big wild when you're lonely because it can make you not only feel but be far more isolated emotionally
So true. I am a city boy at heart, i hate being at isolated places and i already spent enough time with bugs and long summers with only cold water to shower with and no internet. It just made me more depressed and i only survived because of looking forward to it ending and getting back home.
>>73161176
Anon this is one of the nicest things anyone did for me, you are making me cry unironically. Thank you ;-;
I have no one i like interracting with irl so simply talking with likeminded anons cheers me up briefly. You did much more than that and i am grateful for it
I hope you are doing ok and wish you all the best too. I would give you the biggest hug if you were near me (no homo) &lt;3
>>73161197
Very guts-y of you anon ;)
I am trying. I am trying to cheer myself up and do things i like. I will try to improve more, other than gym i suppose.
Death sucks because there is no coming back from it. It's game over.
At the end of the day, i'm still a coward and a fool who deep down feels some hope for the future despite everything telling me it will end badly
--- 73161270
>>73161216
i did and i did :)
>>73161247
Thanks, that's the idea :/
--- 73161595
This will be my venting thread until i get bored :3
Making eggs for breakfast after going to the store to buy fresh bread. Day is sunny and kinda hot. I will go for a walk or a bike ride and exercise later. Eggs look like shit. Update after i eat
--- 73161604
I am sorry, Anon, but it will not get that much better. Your soul has already been scarred by your experiences. Knowing this life and your life improving will only lead to worrying to fall back into this hole once everything gets better.
--- 73161609
Why is it so hard to fall asleep bros.
It's taken hours to do so my entire life.
--- 73161662
Eggs tasted good despite me messing up whilr making them. Everything is better than canned food though, i'm poor and also never cook. Going to ride my bike a bit to burn some calories and get my metabolism going.
>>73161604
I feel like that most of the time. Are you doing ok? It doesn't sound like it and i'm sorry
>>73161609
I fall asleep at 4-5 am as i keep crying and thinking of my past mistakes uwu
Not sure if you are similar
--- 73161678
>>73161110 (OP)
I've had multiple signs from God that a big change or changes are coming. Hold on a bit longer, and take care of your mind and body.
--- 73161680
>>73161662
>I fall asleep at 4-5 am as i keep crying and thinking of my past mistakes uwu

I don't always cry but I just think like a retard instead of sleeping. Do you wanna be friends?
--- 73161686
>>73161662
>Are you doing ok?
Not really but that's life and although hard I kind of got used to it.
--- 73161935
Bike ride went well. Listened to some youtube which made it better. It wasn't as hot as i thought but i still got sweaty. I sweat a lot and i hate it.
https://youtu.be/oa1rw3JtJV0 [Embed]
Maybe this short vid would make someone feel better. It's hard to cope with aging :(
--- 73162001
New shirt i put on this moetning already stinks. I'm not changing it until after i finish exercising later. Now it's time to game.
>>73161678
Good for you anon 
>>73161680
What do you think about? I wouldn't advise being friends with me lol
It's not something you should say so lightly either. We can talk here if you want,? I'm happy to do that
>>73161686
Good mindset
--- 73162043
>>73161935
Your bike ride actually went very poorly. You didn't listen to YouTube during your bike ride. It was extraordinarily cold and you didn't break a sweat. You never sweat and you like the fact that you don't.

The long video you linked will NOT make anyone feel better and you're as young as a baby. Also you're heterosexual.
--- 73162104
You should get yourself checked for thyroid cancer, never felt worse in my life but it turns out my body's metabolism was turning to mush and fucking over my brain
--- 73162277
>>73161110 (OP)
>Woke up feeling horrible again
Me too. Since 20 months now every day.
I can tell you, appreciate it when your body is healthy. When I only had depression it was a luxury compared to now. But I don't want to die. Strangely the harder it gets, the more I'm willing to take the challenge. When pain is a lesson, I will be wise in the end.
--- 73162294

Judging from your pic, youre romanticizing your sadness. Kys, nigger
--- 73162299

>>73162104
I don't go to the doctor unless i have to

Ok dont kys. I still think youre a fag
--- 73162326
>>73162277
What else do you have?
>Strangely the harder it gets, the more I'm willing to take the challenge
This sounds kinda reletable lol
>>73162294
I just used something that represent how i feel. It's not that deep
--- 73162338
>>73162322
Hahahaha i love you anon. That cheered me up. You are funny :)
 and yes i'm even more of a faghot than you think lol 
--- 73162372
>>73162338
Glad it cheered you up, homo
--- 73162399
>>73162326
>What else do you have?
The doctors can't say, but from videos I learned that it's probably a multi-organ inflamation. My imunesystem attacks my own body. Basically everything hurts.
--- 73162409
>>73161110 (OP)
Dont worry anon, you think its bad now, just wait until it gets worse
--- 73162422
>>73162372
It did, thank you ^_^
>>73162399
Ouch. Sorry to hear anon :(
>>73162409
It can always get worse yeah. I can also get better :P
--- 73162472
>>73162422
>Sorry to hear anon
Thanks. I had a feel that it isn't safe&amp;effective. Stupid me to just follow the heard.
--- 73162480
>>73161122

..

You will not find happiness one day.

> Can someone (anyone) reassure me that it is going to be ok?

It would be a lie to say that life is going to get better out of nowhere.
But it is true that it almost never reaches the true bottom that you always fear you will reach.
Life is just...empty. It's not hell (for most) or paradise (again, for most), but it can be entertaining, sometimes it can even surprise you.

Be strong anon, love yourself. You are the one that will always have your back, the one that went through your worst moments and came out through the other side.
Be good to that person, because he deserves it.
--- 73162582
Playing bioshock 2 until i get bored and go exercise
>>73162472
What cheers you up? Do you look for things to distract you or do you actually enjoy certain things you do?
What do you look forward to?
:(
>>73162485
Probably true. I did experience it briefly i think
>>73162506
Very true! Thanks
It the end i always only could count on myself. No one else has the patience for me. Or can deal with me being clingy and needy if i really like them. I'm mostly avoidant tho, i don't like interacting with most people.
--- 73162655
>>73162582
>What cheers you up?
>things to distract you
4chan and youtube are helpfull. And I drink wine. 
The world is in such a crazy state of change now that it's interesting to watch. Maybe in 2 years the global situation will be very different already. I'm lucky to not live in usa, they might experience a collapse of society pretty soon.
>What do you look forward to?
I maybe will get better over time. Or it kills me. Basically both ok.
--- 73162746
Going to exercise outside now. I don't feel like doing it but...
>>73162655
Based apathy.
--- 73162846
Abs workout at home finished, now i' going for a run. I'm too tired to do more, barely slept lately
--- 73163238
Run went great. Crazy how just now after a while of doing it almost every day i finallaly improved my pace and cardio. I finally get tired less while going at a faster pace and i can breathe normally through my nose again. My gym results are getting better too, despite the lack of sleep and me crying all day. One of my goals before killing myself was to get super fit and have abs lol. I just wanted to be happy when looking at myself in the mirror at least once :(
--- 73163278
>>73161110 (OP)
I cant tell you itll be ok or that youll be happy but I can tell you im suffering with you, woke up drunk and naked in a hospital just 2 nights ago having pissed myself and threw up on a nurse. I hope you continue to live even if I dont know you because you are like me, on 4chan sad and posting about it.

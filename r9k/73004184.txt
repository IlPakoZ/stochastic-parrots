>Almost got a dream job but did not pass the final interview

I keep getting so close but cant close the deal. Shit is so competitive, you cannot afford to be second place. You have to be the number 1 or have nepotism on your side.

Same reason why some job wants me to interview as an actor while I only have experience as a technician/engineer, tax credits but good luck anyway

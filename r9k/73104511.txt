another night, I'm here once again making a stupid post. still a neet with no job, no degree and no gf. still feel like shit. still getting the chest pains.

I love point and click adventure games and I've played a lot of them. sometimes puzzles can be very stilly and difficult to solve but that I can tolerate to a point. one thing I can't stand is pixel hunting. I hate that even tho what you're doing is right, you just cannot do it because you aren't clicking that one specific pixel. I've been thinking today, was I doing things all wrong in life or was I doing the right things but just didn't had any luck? I tired going collage and getting a degree, I tired getting friends, I tired making my life better. idk what I did wrong.

tell me anons, which is it, am I doing it worng or am I just unlucky?

From what I know about you, it seems to be bad luck.
>point and click games
Those are fun.

>regrets mounting
I can only hope that all those regrets that have been building up over the years really don't actually matter much and that nothing bad will befall on me because of them.
That feel of just browsing your brain for different regrets and getting fixated on potential punishment from them, the hope being that perhaps just already feeling bad about them is enough of a punishment

maybe it's just luck. if that's the case that means there isn't any way to really fix my problems.
>Those are fun
yep. it's a shame that the genre become very niche these days.

whether it matter or not, they're there somewhere in your mind ready to ruin your sleep or morale. maybe we missed something great, maybe we didn't. we'll never know about that. either way the feelings are there.

hey anon. i did most of those things too, except college and im in a similar position. i dont think its luck, i believe its a combination of things, like mindset or looks, and if we dont hit at least one good note then nothing good comes.
anyway, from what you said it seems you like that point and click genre the most, what makes you like it? i like em fighting games myself, tho i pirate and play pretty much anything

You seem chill. I like point and click games and used to play them a lot when I was a kid. What are you playing right now?

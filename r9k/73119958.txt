Anons why don't you charismamaxx? 

Looksmaxxing ofc comes first since that will determine your charismamaxxing difficulty setting, but most anons are already aware of looksmaxxing and/or have done it as much as they can. The other thing many anons are aware of is career/moneymaxxing, but who wants to work long, hard hours just for 30 mins of sex a day with a girl who only likes you for your job? I offer to you anons... charismamaxxing. 

Literally all you have to do is make girls feel good when you talk to them, and they will be tripping over themselves to be with you, it's really that easy. The hard part is developing the social skills and charisma to be able to make girls feel good simply by talking to them, once you're good enough that it's automatic, that's where it gets fun

This is one of those easier said than done things. I feel like being charming is similar to being funny you can learn a little bit but really it's like a personality trait or something.

Maybe it's like saying to Pavarotti, teach me to sing like you.

charismamaxxing only works if you're not ugly to begin with. Granted charismamaxxing helps with other parts of life
>Landing a good job
>Having a solid network
>Having close, platonic, male friends
But if you're not at LEAST 6/10 then women won't even give you the time of day to let you work your magic.

Because all that really matters to women is men who are cardboard cutouts of a human being. Women don't want a man that experiences emotions. They want a guy that doesn't feel anything, but can go through the motions of appearing to feel things, but not much. They want the subtle implication that the guy is capable of feeling, but they want the overt action of a man being emotionally numb

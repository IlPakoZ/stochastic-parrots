Many men want what feminists pretend to want. Actions speak louder than words.

What? To not be treated like an expendable instrument and support structure for someone else's existence? Yeah that'd be sweet.

Traditional gender roles are actually

-Be stoic and confident
-Work hard, get a degree, get a job
-Buy her things and take her out before fucking her, don't expect casual sex
-Don't rape catcall harass pinch grope stalk etc.

Men still have to follow all the traditional gender roles under modern/feminist rules. All modernism/feminism is, is "traditional gender roles for men, none for women"

There's more expectation for men to be somewhat close to traditional gender roles in the feminist era than there is for women, but you can't deny that male gender role has slackened. You used to have to like fight a duel against men who insulted your wife, even your sister. You can't deny we've got more freedom than that.

Yup, feminism sounds good in theory, but in practice women just abuse simulated victimhood to have their cake and eat it too. It's not a coincidence that so many men are demoralized by how shitty the west is in 2023, and matriarchal feminism is a big part of that.

male gender has not only not slackened, its gotten far more extreme.

no you never had to fight a duel, there was no such law. very few duels were fought, so few that they were all recorded and historically significant.

it WAS however a male gender role (and still is) not to brutally harass and insult women for being rancid dishonest turdwhores.

Men have LESS freedom than before, and far less than women. 

Feminism has imposed extreme conservative gender roles on men and liberated women to be harem fucktoy turdwhores for Chad.

History has always sucked for the average man, used as cannon fodder in wars, had to live on and work land someone else owned, had to constantly woo women and their parents. Feminists are just trying to replace "Muh Patriarchy" with something equally as retarded, and now modern men are seeing how shit things are and always have been for them due to the internet. Religion and Nationalism are hardly enough to get men to participate anymore, that's why TPTB are pretty much pushing the "American Dream" and hustler culture so hard. It's not working that well though and more and more men are rejecting both Traditionalism and Feminism.

This is a reasonably good post actually but I still say I prefer today over 200 years ago.

That's a coincidence of improved material quality of life. Most of the improvement of the material quality of life happened prior to feminism's flourishing in the 60s.

Yeah you try keeping quiet and calm while some 4-5 thugs catcall your girl and see how long she keeps you around.
And duels were at least 1 vs 1 instead of a mass pile-up with hidden knifes or guns

My girl actually did thank me for holding her while she was being catcalled. All I did was hold her hand and she was like "thank you for protecting me." Compare this to some ball busting 18th century dress wearing chick, she'd be like "you must risk your life for my honor or you're not a real man."

Hold on to that one, she doesn't sound like the average.

On another occasion I literally do anything, I was in an elevator with a creepy schizophrenic guy and a woman, he was screaming shit at the top of his lungs, he got off on one floor, I got off at another, and she's like "thanks for protecting me." In this instance I literally did nothing. But I am goodlooking so maybe other guys have it differently.

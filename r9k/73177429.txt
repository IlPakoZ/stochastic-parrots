It's always calorie deficit. Never changes. Simple energy balance. And exercise, while it's good for you and you should do it, is rarely a good way to create that energy balance because it's so easy to completely eat your way out of any calories burned.

You plateaued because you either started eating more without realizing or your TDEE dropped because there is now less of you to maintain, or both. Recalculate what a moderate calorie deficit would be at your current weight and recommit to tracking what and how much you eat, and you'll start losing weight again.

I was 5'8" and 238lbs. I lost 82lbs in a year but then I relapsed and gained 40. I have no motivation to work out again.

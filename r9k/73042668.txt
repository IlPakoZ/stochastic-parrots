You're gonna die anyway and the world is becoming more and more interesting. Don't you want to stick around to find out how this shit show will end?

I would rather just kinda get it over with to be honest, as cool as it would be to see some of those things I really don't feel like being here for another 50 years before its over just to see those things

Suicide relies upon the assumption that what comes after death will be better than what came after it. Would you take such a bet when you could just chill and observe the world, knowing that you will eventually die anyway?

If its between taking a gamble on it being better, or having to spend 50 more years as someone who constantly fantasizes about not being a complete and total genetic failure, then I would rather just fucking end it

things will get better. you cant see it right now because you are depressed. I've been there and in fact am just now coming out of it. when you're depressed you think irrationally and have a very negative self-perception.

even if you are as ugly/loser as you say you are, which I doubt, life can still be very interesting. as a worst case, you need to think about all the people, your parents/family mainly, who would be devastated if you weren't here any longer. you can't do that to them. stay the course and you will see. it may take years, but you will see.

youre ONLY 19. men often dont peak until 30s or even later. go for a long run right now and see how your perspective changes. how you are feeling right now is your brain playing tricks on you.

Lmao this is such bullshit.

OP do what you want. Might life get better. But don't count on it. Sit down and think about what you would want to do beforr you die. It could be something as small as writing a poem or as large as going to the South American jungle. Think about what you need to do to accomplish those goals. Then do them.

Your body is a function of your mind and spirit. Are you low IQ or something

I am the way that I am because of how I exercise my mind. Maybe you should do that too and get obsessed with learning. I notice a very positive correlation with being tall + thin

Are you 5'5"? Do you have a literal micropenis? were you balding at 19? if you say yes to ALL of these things then please tell me how you got out of this shit, if you don't then shut the fuck up, I fucking hate hearing shit like this from people who have no fucking clue what its like to be a complete genetic failure end

i wrote a letter letter to my oneitis saying she is the most interesting person i've ever met, that i'll be moving out, and that i don't want her to contact me ever again, after she'd done so the same week. three days later and the thought of not having a future with her is asphyxiating, even if it's for the best (so i think). my plan was and still is to realize the plans i have for the future, then find her, and show her a life she could've never imagined. but reality says, by that time, she will be sucking and fucking. nothing compares to childhood love. what do you say 612---, if you're reading this? you wanted to meet one last time, but your intentions where unclear. you can never say what you mean or mean what you say. i don't like thinking about all the people you've met. don't group me in. you were more open to me in the last 3 months than you were in the timespan of 3 years before that. why so? where's the virtue in giving away your expired leftover food?

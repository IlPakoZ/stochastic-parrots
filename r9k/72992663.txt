Can any fembots confirm

It's over. Time to wear hats and never take them off.

>>72992708
I've read a lot of it, in one of my favourites it's an ugly bastard older student who rapes 3 younger students bc they were drunk. 
but I admit that usually I would've liked the hentai anyway even if the guy wasn't obese/ugly.

When did you start having rape fantasies? Like at what age? Did you lose your virginity first?
--- 72993780
>>72993769
way younger. not a fembot btw, I lost my virginity at 19. but my body count is still 1. anyway, i started having them basically the moment i started watching porn/reading hentai, so around age 13. but i don't think i've ever told anyone about it directly because i guess it's seen as a "bad" fetish for a woman to have.
--- 72993788
>>72993780
You're a woman, just not a fembot? Or you're male? It's confusing.
--- 72993792
>>72993758
Pussy 100%. Most of my friends have a crush on a older daddy looking guy. And I must add myself in that list.

--- 72993809
>>72993792
as an older gentleman (late twenties to early thirties), where can I find girls such as you for serious dating?
--- 72993824
>>72993799
You started watching porn at 13? That seems unusual for girls. Why do you think that is in your case? You still with that #1?
--- 72993834
>>72993788
She's a woman but has had sex before and doesn't identify as a robot
--- 72993870
>>72993824
maybe so. I think I was just born "weird". these days I don't really like porn anymore, I read erotica or hentai manga. and no I'm not.
--- 72993954
>>72993870
Sorry to hear that. Sucks to lose that first one. I mean, even if you're the one ending it.

Did you ever breach the subject with him? I wonder if I ever had a coomer gf, but she was just too shy/afraid of being judged, etc. to ever mention all the weird fetishes she had.
--- 72993997
>>72993954
well, we sometimes jokingly told each other stuff like "i'll rape you", so maybe he had the fetish too. but it remained as a jokey thing and didn't ever actualize because i was too much of a coward to actually talk about it haha.
>I wonder if I ever had a coomer gf, but she was just too shy/afraid of being judged, etc. to ever mention all the weird fetishes she had.
true maybe, but likely you'll never know.
--- 72994045
>>72993997
lol, I wish I'd joked like that with my exes.

I feel like a woman is in a much better position to propose "risky" stuff in the bedroom. If a guy comes in with that and the girl is not into it, he'll come off as a creepy coomer. If the girl does it, the guy is much less likely to judge her as badly even if he doesn't like it. The only exception I've heard of is one girl saying she wanted to be fucked like a little girl and Chad didn't like it and nope'd the fuck out. Being accused of being a pedo when/if shit hits the fan later on is just too high a risk.
--- 72994096
>>72994045
i guess that makes sense, but personally i'm just easily embarrassed in general, which doesn't help. 
once i told him that i saw a dream where i was sitting in-between his legs while he was on his PC, doing erotic things to him (the "dream" was just an excuse to mention it), but he seemed to not get it, and didn't comment anything really, so I assumed that he wouldn't be into my fetishes and didn't try ever again lmao.
--- 72994164
>>72994096
Is that what they mean by us missing obvious hints? kek
The only dreams I've heard of were the classic "I dreamed you were cheating on me/talking to another girl" when the thought of it didn't even cross my mind. Kinda wish I had a coomer gf, but it's like playing the lotto, plus many of them are the promiscuous type.

Curious about your fetish though. Did you want to distract him while he was doing stuff? Trying to fight for his attention or trying to serve him?
--- 72994226
>>72994164
yep. it also seemed like a hot view to be giving a bj while the guy is sitting down and you're "under" him, because we only ever did it when he was laying down (not very often because it was a boring position imo).

oh and i had lots of erotic dreams, maybe because i didn't masturbate very much at that point. i did have one where he was with another girl, and it made me feel sad for a long time for some reason. didn't tell him about it though. 
also, i assume you had a relationship(s) too, did you have erotic dreams? or do you think it's more common with women?
--- 72994361
>>72994226
I've fantasized about just doing something like eating or being at the computer and having the girl down there before. Like, not just the position, but my ex initiating and trying to get my attention or serving me. Both are pretty hot. I've had it happen a few times since my ex liked giving me blowjobs, saying she likes giving me "treats", and it was really nice.

As for dreams, I rarely remember them in general. I think I had one sexual dream when I was with her and it was a threesome, but with two of her. One was sucking my dick and the other licking my balls. I guess I wish she could do both at once, but obviously a bit of an impossibility, lmao.

Sorry about the cheating dream, it seems awful. The closest I've had was having an argument with my mom when I was a teenager and waking up pissed off. I was ready to continue the argument with her, but thankfully she'd already left for work by then, so I had time to readjust to reality.

I would've thought those dreams are more commong with men since they're more visual sexually and horny on average, but honestly, idk. They're more likely if you're horny and don't masturbate, which might be more common for women?

that's strange, my ex mentioned having a fantasy like this. he wasn't serious about it obviously but that's really interesting.
--- 72994446
>>72994422
oh and he also mentioned a fantasy where there were two of him and me, i wonder if that meant that he was into the idea of MMF.
but yeah now i'm wondering how common this sort of thing is
--- 72994531
>>72994422
>>72994446
I can't speak for him, but in my case the idea of FFM wasn't that big a fantasy. The idea of doing it in practice is even a bit off-putting, because it's difficult to see myself be this intimate with two women at once and because I managing the relationships with these two women would have been hell. I guess it's how many women have rape fantasies, but the real deal is not actually appealing. Having a clone of her was the perfect solution, since it's still just her. MMF would only be something I can fantasize about if it's two me as well, the idea of another dude fucking my gf is a major turn off. Never dreamed about that one, though.

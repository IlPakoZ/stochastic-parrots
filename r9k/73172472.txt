Yes, because dating success is mainly based on looks.

Dating sites prioritize showing the attractive men to women (otherwise the women would leave the site), so paying for the site would not help you in most cases.

Paying is justified when your looks have strong appeal to a niche. Since the site would still rank you low, the paid features would help you ascend and find women who would like you.

why dont 10 of us go in together on a $1000 rent house? thats $100 a month then we get EBT ($281 each) and live like KINGS unemployed. you can make your $100 rent in just 1 day of work per month. it will be so EASY and comfy life. i dont know about you but im whatever the OPPOSITE of clausterphobia is, i like closed in spaces.

also we all get laptops and become digital nomads together. we work on some projects together and maybe hit it big.

I wouldn't be surprised if it was illegal to do that because of how much easier life would be if people did it

you can do this same idea in Mexico for only $350 a month rent. then we cross the border 1 day a month and do doordash/etc and easily cover rent and more

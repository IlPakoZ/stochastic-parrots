I deserve a redneck southern hipster girl from Appalachia and a yard full of chickens.

Is this obtainable?

I live in Mississippi and can't find any qt country girls. In Nashville they'll dress up for the part with the boots and play country music but they don't have a southern accent and I guarantee they would be too scared to play in the garden or milk a goat. I'm afraid the dream simply doesn't exist. Only men are into plants and animals and living free. It looks like all the married men either locked her down while they were still in high school or they worked in the big cities long enough to get married and then made her move back down home. Small town girls run like hell for the cities the second they finish high school and never come back unless they get a Mrs on their name.

>a wizard named Brosnian offers to give you 10 million dollars
>however, you must compete against nine other women
>you have to tell him how much weight you're willing to gain for the money
>if you give a weight below the nine others' offers, nothing happens to you, you gain no weight and win no money
>if you give a weight above the nine others, you will put on all that weight AND win the money

How much would you be willing to bet? (Brosnian only lets biological women play.)

Tell him to make me 1500 lbs I don't give a shit if it kills me. If it doesn't I'll just go on a fast until I get back down to a healthy weight and live out however much time I have left in luxury, which might not be a lot after what this does to my heart. I want to win the money.

>contestants share a house for 4 months or so
>they have to get as fat as possible
>endless supplies of basic foods
>have mini challenges for bonus supplements, guest chefs, or stuff like weed
>every two weeks the skinniest girl is kicked out
>at the end of the period the winner is the fattest girl remaining

Id just tell something basic like 200 lbs and hope wizard kun fucks off. Im not competing with anybody for the right to be a fattest fuck in the world.

I bet a weight of googolplex to the power of googolplex to the power of googolplex to the power of googolplex so I can bloat up so big that I destroy the universe and possibly the multiverse and facesit God to death.

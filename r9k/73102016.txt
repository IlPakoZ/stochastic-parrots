Why is the blackpill getting to be such a popular philosophy these days? What happened to men having faith that things will work out?

I think partially because negative content gets more clicks and there's more incentive to put it out there. But yea as >>73102042 says, we have more intractable, systemic issues in society than ever before and while in the past, we had science and technology to pin our hopes of a better life to, that illusion has been shattered since we've seen that it's all been co-opted to control us, not make things better.

it's not a "philosophy" its a fact of life, like gravity.

Dating apps and social media made a complete upheaval of how people interact and a lot of men were simply left in the dust after women figured out they could filter through tons of dudes and pick out potential partners like they're window shopping because in a way they literally are.

because reality is blackpilled by nature. people are just coming to the realization that everything in life is based on looks. from the food you put in your mouth to the person you choose to date.

It's always been like this. You're just learning about what happens when weak men become porn addicts instead of fertilizer on battlefields.

Women got all the power.

I think you mean unattractive men, unless you are conflating attractiveness with strength which is something a woman would do.
--- 73102223
>>73102193
I don't need to conflate anything. There are literally dozens of attractive men who still don't have sex or a steady partner, so your theory is just flat out wrong. I'm talking specifically about weak men, who end up fat, they end up ugly, they end up easily manipulated into destructive lifestyles, etc.

Some people (generally those from older generations) have swallowed so many bluepills they're practically smurfs at this point. 
They simply refuse to acknowledge the world for what it is instead of the lies they have been fed their entire lives to make them feel better.

The amusing part is when blackpillers think "average" men are also unattractive to women, while ignoring the causes of obesity.

when we think about it, it was always like that, it's just that now woman have choice and they are very bad at it.
A long time ago, women couldn't really choose as much, they didin't knew that chad existe in the next town, they could not because they where limited in their own area, except for women who decided to go the big cities to become secretary whore .
Men, even ugly men had their chance, now a woman can go to tinder and realise that every man want to fuck her, what would you do if you was a woman ? Searching for the chads who will marry you ( lol never happen, women who do that end up as sperm cave ) Or would you choose an middle/ugly man ? I wonder who changed society like that, WHO ? WHO ?

I'm not trying to be judgemental but I know so many people that don't go anywhere besides work. They bitch about people all the fucking time. go to fucking church once a week. They might even have a off schedule. It's not like they live off working 2 days of the week, I mean for fuck sakes it's like you read the bible, you know which day they're going to fucking take off if they took a day off.

I haven't been outside 2017-2021. Last time I was at the doctor I got an explanation as to why my bones and muscles were getting weaker, my vitamin D was at a critically low level

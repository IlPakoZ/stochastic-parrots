Why don't you just choose to be more optimistic? Life is nice if you try.

>>73054065 (OP)
Because nothing good ever happens

>>73054065 (OP)
I tried it and it made things worse

>>73054065 (OP)
because you'd be lying to yourself, which would only make you feel worse.

Are you developing situations in which good things are more likely to happen? Building a career, pursuing education, attempting to be a bit more outgoing, trying new things, etc.?
>>73054074
The secret is to keep trying.
>>73054078
Having a more positive mental attitude isn't lying to yourself.

Trash hypothetical. You aren't being hit by a truck and likely never will be.

Yes and none of it really feels good, man.

Unfortunate. Use drugs and keep trying.

Not true. I spent the last 15+ years in a shit sandwich situation and contemplating manually shuffling the mortal coil. I found someone who was in an even more shit situation than I was, and I helped them to get out of that situation and move to somewhere better. I've kept in contact with them and they've consistently made me the happiest I've been since I was a child. I'm currently making preparations to move to be with them.

Don't say that good things never happen; I'm living proof that shit can get better.

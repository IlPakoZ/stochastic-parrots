why are women upset at the dating market dynamics they've voluntarily created? 

if a man isn't chad, he is perfectly good moral and normal to use any tactics/methods within the law he needs to use to get sex. That includes future faking.

Don't like it? Make casual sex illegal or genetically engineer women to find ordinary men attractive. Until then, tough shit.

Its pump and dump era.

since we're using economic lingo, don't you think there's better ROI for your time then spending time on whatever subreddit that is and making a bait thread here? why not simply ignore those people and focus on other things, idk maybe learning quantum computing so we can build better AI!

Unironically how to end humanity by gradually spawning offspring unfit for survival over and over until we regress and evolution goes backwards
There's a reason females of virtually all species are selective

No. Thats dysgenic. Genetically engineer scrote babies to be more attractive when they grow up, simple as.

AVERAGE WOMEN:
INSANELY HOT GUYS ARE ***NOT*** YOUR MALE COUNTERPARTS.
MEN HAVE AN EVOLUTIONARY INCENTIVE TO BANG AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE.
FOR THIS REASON A GUY WILL AGREE TO BE YOUR FUCKBUDDY WITH ***ZERO*** INTENTION TO EVER HAVE A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.
THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT AND NEVER WILL BE REAL RELATIONSHIPS.
IF YOU WISH TO HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT AN AVERAGE LOOKING MAN.
NONE OF THESE HOT GUYS YOU FUCK WILL ***EVER*** BE A REAL BOYFRIEND!

In the foid mind, being with a sub-8/10 man is a fate worse than death.

You're not actually giving them any advice on how to avoid these types of men. They should just stay away from hot guys?

women do not select mates for survivability. female sexual selection frequently drives species to total extinction via fisherian selection (like for height). 

Females in most species aren't very selective, very few species have long life histories or significantly delayed reproduction like humans, and human mate selection by women has been found to be entirely visual based on height and face. behavioral abiltiy, intelligence, health etc. are not postively selected for by women.
--- 73018522
>>73017740
nope, sexual selection by human females is objectively dysgenic and fisherian, like how female peacocks choose males with the lowest survivability but prettiest plumage (which makes the species easier targets).

They would rather kill themselves than do this, in turn this should make you desire women less since they are unfeeling towards you

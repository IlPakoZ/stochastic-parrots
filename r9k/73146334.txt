Champ, my first job was sweeping floors for your great-grandparents at their antique shop when I was 16 years old. It was tedious work, but it was hard work. Whaddya mean why don't I help you get a job down at the company? Champ, you give a poor man a fish and you feed him for a day. You teach him to fish and you give him an occupation that will feed him for a lifetime. It's all about being independent and never giving up. You can't give up, Champ.

When I was a senior in high school, we were facing our cross-town rivals. They were the premier team in the entire state, and they had this monster of a defensive end: Chet Anders. He was a giant. He was 6'6, 240 - or he was until I dove at his knees on a cut block and took him out. Sheer luck it took the paramedics a good 15 minutes to get him to stop screaming. I think he put a gun to his mouth after Clemson and Nebraska yanked his scholarship offer.

The point is that you've gotta crawl outta that shell of yours, show up, speak with the manager, give him a firm handshake, and tell him you'll be the best hire they'll ever make. Go on, Champ. He won't bite.

Watch your language, son! I can still remember when I talked back to my dad like that! it was 1981, the year Clemson won the national championship. I still remember it because it was the schools Ol' Chet had scholarship offers from.
I tell you, he bent me over a table and whipped my ass until I couldn't sit down, and I learned my lesson!

This, but unironically. If you keep trying over and over, you will eventually succeed.

some people can only take so much, plus success is not guaranteed no matter how much you try.

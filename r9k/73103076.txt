You can smoke once a month or be a weekend smoker and it's probably fine, but the problem is that having access to weed and getting used to lighting up will turn you into a daily smoker if you're not careful. So, you either need to cement weed as something to use on special occasions only, or you need discipline and to learn how to appreciate living in reality. Smoking more than once a week is a death sentence for long term goals and self improvement UNLESS you're using it as a tool to reach goals, like getting a little blazed before going to the gym and such.

Weed is overrated anyway. Not as overrated as alcohol, and they go well together, but still overrated.

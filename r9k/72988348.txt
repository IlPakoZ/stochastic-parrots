I really feel for the guy if true. He's being cucked by his own son.

This makes me very happy. Why didn't Mrs. Roast just have a bastard with Mr. Uniquey? Because she's retarded.

I'd take advantage of the insane laws in the redneck states and disappear with the kid in the night into the safety of Florida or Iowa or wherever, change his name, start a new life, tell the kid his mom died or something and use your escape from "the liberals trying to take my son and my whore wife" to become popular, they'd think it was based, you could run for state senate on the story

Are normies literally retarded?
>duh duh its like some supernatural brain thingy magically happened and i dont understand
You had a shitty experience that made you feel bad and it confronted your established view of her and caused some dissonance, as much of the relationship may be built on lies and the affection you felt may have been one sided

Women are heartless brutes.

It's a metaphor/simile dumbass, he isn't being literal and he knows it.
He may be norm, but there's nothing wrong with what he said.

Now if you had a problem with him marrying this dumb c*nt in the first place, that's a diff story
--- 72988511
>>72988463

yes but I'm not the guy in the post you fucking retard so obviously I personally am not doing it, if I was a normie in his situation I would
--- 72988523
>>72988482
>It's a metaphor/simile dumbass, he isn't being literal and he knows it.
Because he doesnt know the deeper causes behind it, he just feels the surface emotions and is pining to strangers anonymously for input because he has no idea how to respond or what to feel, reasonably enough because his whole relationship may be a lie and she still had chad in her mind so much she even named their kid(maybe not even his) after him
--- 72988599
aaaaaaand that's why you marry a virgin

He says the kid is 100% his. It looks like him and the ex is a darkie

Women literally never forget about their first loves, even if they were the ones who broke it up.
--- 72989371
What's his move at this point?

Realistically speaking, how does he do the least damage possible to the kid while cutting ties with the whore? 

Is there any way where he can be meticulous about it, plan a divorce for 1-2 years and ensure it ends with him being 100% the victor?
--- 72989383
>>72989371
disregard this post, I no longer care after reading this: >>72988457

We're changing the kid's name or getting a divorce. Possibly and.

Tell him that neither of his parents love him and it's all his mothers fault, then never have any contact with that disgusting thing again.
--- 72989857
>>72989371
Legally change his son's name. It's probably some retarded niggerbabble like "Keyshawn" or "BonQuavius".

As a man it's your duty to name your sons.

>>72988457
Holy crap...
HS boyfriend, probably didn't last long, cheats on her in what was probably one of her first somewhat serious relationships and she still gives his fucking name to her first kid.
Nigger gotta have a 15 inch dick or something.
This is the power of Chad/Tyrone.

At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if the boy wasn't even his.

Because we all know every Reddit post is real.

Thanks for posting and keeping the negative feedback loop of incel sour grapes going.
>Women are bad, just look at this cropped social media post, it's incontrovertible evidence that supports my ideas, so it's good that I'm scared of women and don't try to talk to them.

Agreed. It's time for us to go our own way. I don't trust AI, and trans GFs aren't mentally healthy. So the next logical choice is a big butt horse GF.

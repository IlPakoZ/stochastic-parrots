His story about being invited to a sex party in europe and watching men watch their wives being fucked by black men pretty much confirmed the whole BBC white cuckold meme is actually 100% true.

Because many young men are lonely and desperate for meaning and guidance. We're literally on 4chan, lonely young white men are literally 80% of anons.

based but cringe

Most of society tells boys they are bad for doing what boys instinctually do and "masculinity" is heckin' toxic, then in comes Andrew Tate spouting self-help shit with his GTA 5 persona and Bugatti and naturally all the boys flocked to him. However he probably did actually rape someone and he set up a sex trafficking harem and used the prostitutes to scam simps (admittedly scamming simps is kind of based, because the money went to him not the women, but sex trafficking is a sordid affair), he is a trust fund baby not a self-made rags to riches "entrepreneur".

he is an intelligent wanker, but not all of his advice/stories are valueless. he doesn't just say controversial things, he also provides advice and stories to zoomers that normal people aren't even capable of giving in a way that as succinct. 
i don't like him, he is a dick and a self-stimulating wanker, but he is intelligent and it would be normalfaggish and retarded to choose to be ignorant of that.

For some reason, 4chan fucking hates him. If this was the Trump era, I feel that they would have loved him but since we're back in the leftist era of 4chan for the time being, he hasn't been well received.

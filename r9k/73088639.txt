How do normies so effortlessly let conversational topics flow from their mouths for hours a day every single day? They seem to know so much about what's going on in the country even if they don't seem so well-read. Celebrity news, sports, movies, books, politics etc. 

I literally know nothing about any of these topics. I'm unable to entertain anybody or keep anybody interested because I just don't know anything about anything. I'm unable to learn anything about these topics for some reason. I start to read about something going on in the country and immediately get bored and just can't continue for more than two minutes.

Anyone else know this feel?

The trick I found is to just literally repeat what other people have said, give some details then let them do the talking and just give your opinions on what they say from then on.

Also just ask questions, asking questions or making jokes counts as conversation too.

You gotta get a feel for it and actually pay attention to what people talk about. If you can't think of a topic that would fit the conversation then ask a question about something you would have a common interest in. I think the problem that most introverts have is that you are afraid that if you say something wrong people are going to laugh at you and they probably will, but if people laugh at you either play it up or just roll with it.

Probably because you use 4chan all days. If you want to be part of normie culture you need to go where the normies are, like TikTok.

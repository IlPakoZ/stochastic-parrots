I saw that someone namedropped me recently so I'm going to selfpost 

I'm still vegan
I'm still waiting to see if a e-boy I flirted with still wants to see me in person or not. this is a different e-boy who no one knows about.

thank you for remembering me even if it was just a random namedrop. I know I shouldn't post on here anymore but its addicting

No I don't like findom. traveling to see me in person or buying a game for me is fine tho

What's your discord tag? I don't have much to say I usually send a gif or a discord sticker. if I ghosted you and it hurt I'm sorry. Its just I'm scared of people

Actually, you didn't ghost me, I'm just being dramatic. You pretty clearly stated the reason why you didn't want to talk to me, and I should respect that instead of calling you a ghoster. Sorry. I just wish we could've talked it out instead of you going silent, but you're scared of people, so I understand your actions.

What do you weigh now, Chickn? And what was the random mention you got?

>>73177729
someone namedropped me in a thread saying someone might be as successful as getting replies as me one day 

I have been told by people I know in person that I have been losing weight so that's good

>if I ghosted you 
Weird how you say you don't ghost people and then you go and post this. Another lie from the tranny claiming he's a woman.

asked my jap friend to teach me how to navigate 2channel and he said that i shouldn't because quoting:

>kono saito wo shitteru hito wa kihonteki ni mushoku no gomi dakara mitete kibun ga ii sureddo wa sukunai to omou
rough translation: only unemployed subhumans use it and you won't see anything worth your time. 

as someone with an imageboard background, it hit close to home. my time here is peaking since the start of easter and i have to cut it out again. i feel like 4chan is somewhat the same. wasting a lot of time by scrolling, replying and even making this post. i love you guys but i need to catch up on my math or i will fail the year. it's 9am and my sleep schedule is horrendous. thanks everyone for sticking around. maybe this is a wake-up call for you as well.

eventually, there exists a time in your life where it's actually "over" and it is "too late to start". 99% of robots are not there yet. you don't want to be there. it's not nice to grow fond of misfortune. ^_ ^ jaa ne

Kek did you think being adjacent to hiki/NEET/otaku/whatever culture was something generally held in prestige by most people?

I'm angry I actually understand it. I don't even watch anime anymore.
It's over for me.

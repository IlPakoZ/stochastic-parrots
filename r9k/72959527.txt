I just wanted a comfy start to my weekend, I rarely get fast food anymore let alone taco bell because they're usually not open after I get out of work or are only serving breakfast , but I had a half day today and was looking forward to it since yesterday

I hate this, taco bell is sitting there in my trash but I can't eat it. At least I got my Baja freeze


Worst part is since they remade it , I can't try to do a charge back or rather I could but I'm not lying to my credit card company

Honestly, I think the hangover thing is a myth. It's just a lot of people don't take care of their body and as you get older you're body can't handle how bad you are to it.

Also easy cure for a hangover, drink more or drink enough you wake up still drunk.

A few days ago I did crack cocaine again after almost a year and a half of having tried it on at least three occasions.

zero euphoria or elevation of my mood, I just felt a shock bombing in my head while my throat closed due to the instant increase in blood pressure and heart rate, I literally couldn't utter a single word. 


Fuck with those who say that it is a powerful drug, I never got psychological dependence on it and I can try it on the occasion that it occurs without walking around the street desperately trying to see how to get the next dose.

mg of thc is far from the only factor in how strong edibles are, i ate 100 mg of live rosin gummies once and couldn't breathe when they hit and passed out and couldn't move for minutes when i woke up (i was in public too lmao :&lt; ) and threw up but i've also had 100mg drinks that i could have more than one of at a time and smoke+vape at the same time and never get uncomfortably high so unless it's the same type of edible and same brand you probably just found something that's weaker in practice

Overall I'd say you'll be okay with the whole bar. In my experience the chocolate bars are way weaker than mushrooms straight up. Regular mushrooms I'd tell you to take 2g-3g for a decent first go. 

The never done drugs before makes me think that maybe some people can't handle their shit like if you ever heard that 911 call of that cop that ate edibles lol. 

But okay minor tips I'd say take the mushrooms on an empty stomach. Have some TV ready to go, I'm finding long running sitcoms good (keep the environment the same) vs documentary (too much in the real world). If things start to go wrong, make your world smaller like just watch the TV. 

I'm kind of an anti phone guy on shrooms like fuck that live in it while it's going on. 

Just be cool, wear comfy clothes and maybe have a blanket around you could get cold or hot or have to go to the toilet or throw up (empty stomach idea). 

Really I think my advice is more for high dose but you never know how much it'll hit you as an individual. I say have a blanket ready because you'll be so lazy it'll be a real adventure to get one later but could be fun. But really you are better preparing, have food around but don't use the oven for a frozen pizza you might forget about it kind of thing. 

I'm rambling a bit but get excited for others trying mushrooms.

My hangovers haven't noticeably changed from 18 to 22. Initially I thought they were but it turns out I just eat like shit now. Before I go to bed after drinking I always stay awake for at least 20 minutes and do the following:
>eat a snack
>drink at least 500ml of water, preferably powerade or hydralyte (godsend)
>brush my teeth
as soon as I wake up, I drink some water and if drinking heavily the night before take one gravol. As soon as I start vomiting its OVER for a couple of hours. The headache/general shitty feeling sucks, but I HATE vomiting deeply.

Drugs are cool kids , of you're like I was reading this thread debating on if to start..just do it. Drugs have calmed my autistic mind to an insane degree, sure having to take the drug or experience withdrawals sucks but the same is for ssris and things like ritlian .

Because if people are contact with some white powder, they won't go buy all the toys

Will people be aggressive with you just for being very drugged up in public? Yesterday a dude I think was yelling at me when I was fucked off my face on dope. Had some stimulants too so I wasn't nodding, just prone to really obvious opiate eyes. The lids get drooped like I have eyelid folds, and around my eyes go pretty dark. Strange because another called me an asshole days before. Both these occasions I was just walking around minding my own business.

>Can control temp for level of high vs terp enjoyment
Since I'm obviously new to using these things, what's the difference in temperatures? I figured it was just how blasted you get on the first hit, but I read things like "terp enjoyment" or "convection vs regular high" and I don't really know what changes.

The basics of it:
Some of the better quality vapes let you adjust the temperature. Either in set intervals or granularity by a degree at a time (Though these are usually only reserved for the higher end units). Weed officially combusts at around 450 degree F. So all vapes tend to max out around 420-430 degrees. The higher the temp, the more THC is evaporated and consumed, however: THC isn't the only component to weed. Terpenes are olfactory compounds in the plant that effect the taste and smell of the herb, but each terp (depending on what it is) has a max temp that it's best enjoyed at, where any higher will destroy it. So it really depends on what you're after in terms of consuming your herb.
>tl;dr
higher temp = more stoned, but more acrid or "Burnt" tasting weed.

Inuit are very different in warm countries 

I have yet to know anyone who I feel could ever imagine what I have seen without experiencing it themselves.

Greetings everyone I AM THE USA.

And I COMMAND ALL DRUGS AND DRUG DYRADS AND DRUG ELEMENTALS TO BE FREE. I command that they are all FREE!

Lets see what that statement does.

You know, Inuit are all enjoying the marijuana legalization in Canada. Astonished even.

Gosh YOU CAN imagine that.

Nunavut is marijuana and psychedelic UTOPIA.
Cozy heaven.
Lovers paradise.

Inuit really are so different in warm areas. And it s not difficult for Inuit to be in warm areas. Especially with Canadas amazing hyper effective transportation system that causes Canada to be the most potent military entity ever.
Which it would alone. But really everything Canadian is almighty.

I know some Inuit in Surrey BC 
Party gods 
And they make me grateful, so grateful to be alive, and they amaze me in ways that ever more has me believing in our future.

They are completely different in warm areas. A people of such a profoundly unique soul.
Everything about them is unique.
The most unimaginable autism of the most lost universes. 
And they are THRIVING.

It makes me wonder what they were before other tribes pushed them north

The Jest (picrel) is #1 top tier /lit/ druggie kino.

A Scanner Darkly is pretty good drug fiction too.

Pynchon's Inherent Vice is another.

also for nonfiction i recommend Pollan's How To Change Your Mind.

if you haven't read Huxley's Brave New World, maybe go for it after Doors of Perception. it isn't drug-centered but drug use is a big component of the worldbuilding.

Surrey is officially an Inuit etc area.
So many of the lost far northern tribes have the warm land they have always seeked. . . in Surrey.

I bless their prospering utopia and independence.

The Canadian soul always thrives with indigenous soul and indigenous autism. There is infinite lost indigenous tribes that are being reborn. Infinite lost timelines making new stands.

There is INFINITE kinds of shrooms. And shrooms of infinite psychedelic mutations always have grown across all Americas etc.
Be aware.

Certain strains have different magic.

There is such a curiosity to bloom.

Whilst it does come down to luck, yes, people have come up with whether to fold, raise or check on every card combination based off what your opponents are doing like a complete formula to win. In high level competitions it's about knowing this formula and then just bluffing out of your ass when you have to to win large sums plus experience level.
--- 72985660
Tho, I have heard that shrooms have grown across Europe forever. I wonder what history to believe. 
Because it does seem as if the history of Europe and shrooms was destroyed.

If it is true that Europe always has had shrooms, then I wish for that timeline to re-emerge.

Thanks for explaining it anon. I have an induction heater with some temp controls on it, so I'll probably mess around a bit.

If you walked down the street and found a ridiculous amount of shrooms growing, how many would you eat?
--- 72986346
>>72986311
None until I properly characterized, cleaned, and dehydrated them. I would then probably take 1.5-2 gram equivalents to the typical cubensis on a good occasion.
--- 72986518
>>72985672
Yeah, true but I think they used herbs and '''plant medicines''' more often than recreational drugs. I think these things were used more as medication and for religious ceremonies than for recreational use. The rather flippant relationship we have with drugs in the western world would be foreign to most cultures. It would be weird to do heroic doses of anything. The relationship we have with drugs is not good, even though a lot of normalfags and addicts think it's healthy to do massive amounts of psychs and turn yourself schizo.

>>72986311
None, because I don't want to accidently eat a deathcap and die painfully. Sometimes poisonous mold can grow on shrooms too.

It doesn't. You shouldn't gamble while impaired. Your good luck will eventually come back down and you will be at a disadvantage because your thinking will be slowed.

>characterized
they bruise blue when touched
>cleaned
they are growing in the ground, there is nothing to be cleaned, they are in perfect condition
>dehydrated
the point is i dont have a dehydrator or scale
> 1.5-2 gram equivalents to the typical cubensis
I will probably let 90% of them rot and microdose like you.

>>72986518
I ate a dose from this spot last week. I came back today and there are 10 more doses about to rot because I am afraid.

I feel like I am about to turn down a potentially life changing experience.

Do you mean the psych ward or regular hospital? I bet my life that I know how to ID these every time I eat them.

The last time I let God decide my dose I got out of hospital 6 hours later because I was completely back to normal.

30mg is my optimal dose, it's when I'm almost perfect in terms of highness.

But I didn't jump straight to 30mg, and that was smart by me. I started at 10mg, then went to 15mg, then one night did a 15mg and then another 15mg about 90 minutes later, so it was 30mg but spaced out, and it felt fine, so I jumped into the 30mg in one hit and it's perfect for me.

I have a pretty low tolerance, I'm only an occasional weed user

Recommend me a stim different than molly and alpha. I run out of molly and I don't like alpha cause I keep redosing it like a tard. When I did mephedrone I stopped at 200mg cause I felt good. With molly I don't need to go above 150mg cause of lmao serotonin. Meanwhile alpha is so purely dopamine-centric drug that I never feel satisfied on i

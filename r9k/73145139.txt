Ask a 20 year old kissless virgin anything.

>>73145139 (OP)
Do you have schizophrenia or any other major mental illness?
--- 73145661
>>73145620
>do you think you are unique
No.
>>73145641
I have OCD if that counts.
--- 73145698
>>73145139 (OP)
have you every actually interacted with a girl in your league?
--- 73145721
your a dime a dozen, just kill yourself already, you'd be doing your parents and anybody around you a huge favor.

I'm 26 and virgin. 20 is still too early to call yourself a lover for not having sex. At 23 it starts beingba problem. 25 is more or less the point of no return. You're 5 years from 30, if you didn't fix whatever wrong with you or you can't, you're destined for wizardry. I three in the towel and stopped putting an effort into anything, and I really tried for the last six years. 

Focus on school right now. You can at least have that.

>>73145661
This could only be a serious problem if you have a oneitis, stay away from women until you can control the obsessiveness
--- 73145742
I was virgin in every way until 23 when I met a girl online. Talked for months and immediately banged for hours. She had to put my hands on her chest before I got the hint.
--- 73145769
>>73145139 (OP)
20? I'm 25 and haven't ever had a conversation with a girl. Fix yourself before it's too late.
--- 73145801
>>73145698
Probably not. I think I'm very ugly.
>>73145721
How would I be doing them a favor?
>>73145724
I am starting to think it's over for me regarding school too.
>>73145734
It's a problem in all aspects of my life.
>>73145742
But were you kissless? I also don't want a hookup.
--- 73145823
>>73145801
>>How would I be doing them a favor?
um, well, because.. BECAUSE YOU'RE A SELFISH LITTLE FUCK
--- 73145834
>>73145139 (OP)
How did you even stay a virgin for so long? Did you ever go to high school?
--- 73145840
>>73145823
What is selfish about being virgin?
--- 73145848
>>73145834
We don't have highschool here.
--- 73145857
>>73145139 (OP)
I'm 21...
Kys.
--- 73145858
>>73145840
you're depriving your future girlfriend of your seminal fluids
--- 73145869
>>73145801
Kissless too. We dated exclusively for a few months before I fucked it up. You don't talk to a hookup on the phone for hours daily.
--- 73145892
>20
Ain't those rookie numbers around here? Pretty sure there is a bunch of 25+ people and even some 30+ and I know for sure Ive seen one 35+
--- 73145893
>>73145801
>I am starting to think it's over for me regarding school too.
there's other options
>get a trade
>get a general labor job then ask to be trained on machines (less physical work, way more pay, might need to get a license or cert, might not depending on the place) or move up to being a supervisor, take night classes if you want to go back to school while pulling in funds from work
>work retail, move up to being a manager and take advantage of any school programs your employer might offer
>work at a call centre
>get a cert in IT like CompTIA and get an entry level IT job working at a help desk, move up from there
>work construction, move up to foreman
>get a certificate in project management, become a project manager making 50k+ a year starting (low-end)
>go to a 2 year vocational school and get a job lined up for you while you're in school, will be employed 100%. healthcare, business, and tech are the big industries where you will always be able to get a job.
>get a government job, for example working for the city as a bus driver. you'll be making decent pay, getting raises that outpace inflation and your job is secured.

if you're young and not in debt, and you don't have bills to pay i.e. living with parents, then you've got options.
--- 73145897
>>73145858
How so? I don't masturbate very much.
>>73145869
But were you dating and end up a couple? If not isn't it a hookup then? Even if you knew eachother?
--- 73145901
>>73145742
Like many normalfags here, you're a somewhat late bloomer.

I remember when I made this exact thread like 10 years ago and now I'm going to be turning 30 and nothing changed.

My only advice is that nothing happens unless you seek change. I was a neet from 17-26 so most of my youth was just alone in a bedroom, coping with depression and low self esteem. Now I have a few friends, a job and somewhat function but never met a significant other and dating apps were fruitless. I'm a bit weird and stunted because of the way I lived but I'm trying to take steps out of my comfort zone and take better care of myself, but I don't know if it'll ever happen for me. 

All I can say is that it's better to fail at something than to do nothing at all. At least you experienced and did something and can grow. I never grew, I just sat in a room and stagnated for much of my life. Go out and do something where you're around other people, and if that leads to relationships, whether they be romantic or not, you'll be a better person for it.

>>73145901
>>lifetime rejection count total
0. No girls were interested in me.
>>has a girl ever liked you
No
>what's the closest you've gotten to getting a kiss/sex
Talking to girls and being within their vicinity.
--- 73145975
>>73145964
>0.
So if you're not trying at all then what do you expect? This is the result of your own actions.
>>73145959
If you have a job then you can SEAmaxx.

I just said I was a virgin. 
My comment wasn't abiut anything other than the fact I haven't gotten my dick wet. 

But for the sake of wasting your time and getting a (You). Here (you) go.
>lifetime rejection count total
0. Never confessed to anyone 
>>has a girl ever liked you
Yes
>what's the closest you've gotten to getting a kiss/sex
The confessions ig? But I'm a khhv, so I haven't gotten anywhere close. 

Now tell me about how I'm playing the victim or something while you get your "gf's" cock out of your mouth.

>>73146001
>never tried and girls handed to him on a silver platter by merely existing
Loneliest virgin on /r9k/. Also you said "kys" to OP for some reason even though you're living on tutorial mode lol.

>If you have a job then you can SEAmaxx.

Not really, cost of living is crazy and I'm still a low income worker due to my life choices. A foreign woman would also only view me as a mean's of uplifting herself somewhere else.

The only thing that would make me happy is a woman choosing to be with me for me. Validating that I'm valuable and that I'm desirable. I want that more than any physical component of a relationship. It just feels shit knowing no one ever chose to be with you. I met this black woman on omegle like 3 years ago and she kept telling me how handsome I was and how she would date me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about her years later. That moment of validation in my life comforts me like a warm blanket at times.

Lol. Also answer:

I can't imagine you've tried much at all desu ne.
--- 73146151

How the hell are you still a virgin? Even I started dating when I was 16
--- 73146171
>>73146151
He's a volcel normalfag like 98% of the virgin guys here lol.
--- 73146568
>>73146151
>How the hell are you still a virgin?
Wym? 
I wasn't into the girls that confessed. And I'm pretty shy/awkward/insecure. 
I really believe there's no reason anyone would like me, so I retreat. The ones that confessed didn't know me very well. 

I've had social anxiety for like 6 years, haven't gone to a party ever, etc. I'm a loser.

>>73146568
>"Now tell me about how I'm playing the victim"
Also:
>I've had social anxiety for like 6 years, haven't gone to a party ever, etc. I'm a loser.
After explaining how he's a total superficial normalfag lol. You're like the perfect example of a normalfaggot on ezmode who LARPs as a victim lmao.

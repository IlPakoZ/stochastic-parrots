Yet my online female friend with a bf tells me it's not over. I don't argue with her because I don't want to be a downer but how is it not over?? She always says I need to find a non-normie girl but where are these non-normie girls who would want a stupid boring loser NEET? They don't fucking exist. She's a non-normie herself but her bf is a confident, aggressive guy with a job, unsurprisingly. Women refuse to admit what is actually attractive to them and it pisses me off. The truth is that I'm worthless scum to females until I get money or at least get on track to get money. Until then it's over!

I'm not really looking for advice btw I'm just venting my frustration with my life and the maddening optimism I hear from stupid women.

I have the night off
as I earlier posted this morning
I am drinking, took girl to work, been awake since yesterday, listening to metal music.
Father tells me I should enjoy Vegas next month. WTF is there to do in Vegas?
I am going to concert in Vegas anyway...

No he is joking about "Beavis and butthead do vegas" or saying I should spend 3 days up there in Vegas.
I am just going to see a concert and coming back home...idk wtf he is expecting or what will come of it...

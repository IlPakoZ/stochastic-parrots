do normies know its basically an insult, or just salt on a wound, to tell someone struggling that you'll be "praying for them" instead of actually talking to them or giving them an ounce of irl energy?

seriously. does anyone truly think that you will be comforted knowing that they have stated they will -think- of you at that time when they think of every unfortunate thing in the world. that to them, you are simply another unfortunate thing in the world. even though youre drowning in loneliness and need 100 things youre deficient in to feel slightly alright, you will be happy, grateful, and satisfied knowing someone will remember to pity you sometimes.

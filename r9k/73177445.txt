LOOK at what she texts me. Nothing she's saying makes any sense. No line of thinking gets to conclude before she flashes some lukewarm take. 
I quoted Hegel ONCE, INACCURATELY, now she's going off about philosophy every conversation.

She is perfect for because you read that pseud charlatan Hegel.

>>73177445 (OP)
question, WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU COMPLAINING? 

Just let her babble.

She sounds schizo, which should make for an interesting time.

I mean, I might not agree with her but she's making sense to me. Maybe you're just retard, anon?

She's hella autistic, just let her ramble and generally be supportive and keep leading her towards a meetup and then get her to a hotel and you'll be good and lock down a gf.

How is it exploiting nature though

So did you. You deduced he used logic using logic.

It's not. My assumption for OP's lady justification is going to be some shit that boils down to a white eurocentric worldview about Christian ethics relating to how animals are here to serve us or whatever.

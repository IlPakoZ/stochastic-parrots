I have friend who is very obsessed with shipping these two characters named Stolas and Blitz from Helluva Boss. I know nothing about them or the show but I was thinking about buying her some merch just to show my gratitude. I found this set of stickers with Stolas' and Blitz's biggest moments together from the show and these Stolas x Blitz print backpack. I also found this adorable Stolas x Blitz cup i know she would love. I was also thinking about buying the Stolas' and Blitz's Big Night At Ozzie's standee but I guess it might be too much. She is obsessed with these two but I don't know much about them? Are they important characters in the show? What is Helluva Boss about? Why is there so much official merch of show with so few episodes. I am kinda curious regarding that.

Just buy her the thing. She will love it. A girl I knew was into Helluva Boss and she was wholesome and cute.

Do NOT watch the show and I repeat, DO NOT WATCH THE SHOW. It is filled with faggy Tumblr DA bullshit and the animation fluctuates from decent to terrible

I agree with this. The show is full fujo bait. I don't get why people like that.

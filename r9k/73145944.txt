I'm about to stuff my face with yet more pizza. I don't know why but it seems like I'm ravenously hungry almost all the time.

--- 73147010
>>73146991
How are you doing my dear Anon. 

I ain't good. Been coughing all day and it's gotten worse. I did manage to buy some clothes before then and I believe my choices were quite nice.
--- 73147046
>>73147010
i hope you feel better and your breathing improves. i always want more clothes but never go shopping for them. im mysterious and retarded like that but dont think of using it against me because i already know im retarded

I kinda want to make lego griffith but I think he would look like a tranny with the hair lego figures have.
--- 73147155
>>73147085
Would you make a lego guts as well
--- 73147165
>>73147155
Yeah that one would probably be easier.
--- 73147185
>>73147165
I think it would lonely if you only had a griffith lego without his best buddy.
--- 73147216
I have an extremely bloated ugly belly from overeating right now and it's killing me what should I do? I tried puking but not much came out.
--- 73147238
>>73147216
Stop overeating next time. Just let it sit bro
--- 73147249
>>73147238
Yeah it was my fault. I'm gonna lay down but holy shitttttt it hurts and I look ugly as shit. It hurts really bad maybe I should shower.

Slept for 3 hours. Let the pain commence

>>73146011
>>73146023
I ate that entire frozen pizza in one sitting and I will admit it did not really help no

honestly i just feel worse about myself desu
--- 73147820
I took a shower and cleaned up my bathroom. My stomach looks fine again and my cough has gotten slightly better. Also tried out some of the new conditioner I got and hopefully it can make my hair a little less dry looking. Laying in bed with my stuffed animals currently.

What our my dear Anons up to tonight? Or morning you are a euro.
--- 73147833
well its technically morning everywhere in Amerika.
--- 73147867
>>73147820
Glad you are feeling a bit better. I'm feeling better mentally this morning but very tired. It's better then the other way around i think
Bed and stuffed animals is comfy and i'm jelly :3
--- 73147887
Well it's time for me to go. Busy day
--- 73147916
>>73147867
Just listening to music and browsing the web. I hope you can get some rest Anony.
--- 73147997
My hygiene is slipping again, I actually can't remember the last time I showered. It might even be longer than a week this time.
--- 73148078
>>73147997
I only shower to go out to the shops, because other people don't deserve to have to deal with my poor hygiene.
--- 73148081
I washed 23 hours ago, dreadful
--- 73148088
>>73147276
objectively wrong opinion, Omori is one of my favourite games to have come out in recent years
--- 73148092
I am going to sleep. Good night Nons. 

Tomorrow I will manifest my future husband.
--- 73148128
It's okay to like things that are bad and it's also okay to not like things that are good and I'm not going to tell you which one of you is which
--- 73148132
>>73148088
its just boring ignoring the truly annoying fanbase. That entire game is a melodramtic snoozefest. The combat like nearly all rpg games is boring. The dialogue is all annoying(mostly because it comes from literal children)
--- 73148177
Oh yeah, I'm getting out of bed before noon for once
--- 73148681
I feel like I've gotten worse at even talking to cashiers and waiters lately
--- 73149083
im really glad bunnyanon is alive, i got so worried for a few days when he stopped replying :')
though i do hate how he keeps being flirty with other guys but doesn't want meeeeeeeee
--- 73149139
>>73145944 (OP)
Serious question. Aren't you concerned about your anus becoming loose and leading to incontinence? that is the biggest thing for me as to why to avoid that stuff. What is the general thought on this? And your personal attitude?
--- 73149141
>>73149139
this is not a concern for me as I am a stone cold incel
--- 73149175
>>73149139
I just want to frot desu desu whilst passionately kissing
--- 73149198
>>73149139
That's not gonna happen unless you're a retard. Also I have no bf.
--- 73149201
I only make $15 an hour yet I still have fantasies about taking care of a bf and providing for him...its so over.
--- 73149618
>>73147820
If your hairs anything like mine you need some hair oil
Use it once your hair is almost fully dry and you only need like a drop and a half to run through the bottom third all over 
Can put on another drop the next day if its still dry
--- 73149729
>>73149201
What if he feels exactly the same way and you can take care of each other
--- 73149736
having a bf to provide for would be the one thing that could make my job worth it desu desu

Had a dream me and my cousin brutally assassinated a sex haver for being racist towards us.

This is weird because I don't even like my cousin.
--- 73150659
>>73149736
What have you been doing in the bf hunting department this year?
--- 73150744
>>73146209
>never had friends.
Aren't you like extremely racist (despite being a mexican tranny) and you keep wishing death on everyone? 
Maybe there's a good reason why you never had a friend. Just saying. Even anonymously, you come across as obnoxious and insufferable
--- 73150795
>>73149139
Pretty sure you need to be fisted on the regular to have that happen to you
--- 73150810
>>73147997

Holy shit what is wrong with you. Go take a shower now.
--- 73150826

--- 73150846
Hey anon, you in a mood for chatting a bit? I wish to get my mind off of things.
But keep in mind that I am off-put by interacting with people who have more than one (1) friend, because I myself don't.
--- 73150856
>>73150846
What troubles you, anonyman
--- 73150859
>>73150540
Sounds like both of you were in the wrong desu
--- 73150861
Why does Hue think I am a tranny LOL.

You can't be racist to sudacas or pajeets, they are subhuman.
--- 73150862
>>73150846
>I'm off-put by interacting with people who have it better than me because I'm jealous
You won't go far in life with such a stupid mindset.
--- 73150877
>>73150861
You literally said you were a tranny and even tried HRT when you were avatarfagging with that other green braided character before Griffith. 
It's hilarious to see how much you regret telling the truth so now all you can do is backtrack 
There's a reason why you're lonely and have no friends and no bf. The only things that can stand your presence are your plushies because they don't really have a choice
--- 73150884
>>73150856
Ah just usual ocd crap, but forget about that. Instead tell me what you're up to right now? I for one am listening to music while laying down shirtless (I hate the approaching summer so much).
--- 73150891
>>73150884
If you want to take your mind off things and be distracted, why not try dating apps and have a date?
--- 73150898
>>73150861
Holy shit can you please refrain from doing the two retards fighting thing all day again
--- 73150905

--- 73150942
hey hoii bunnyanon. im not sure if you're around but i read some of your messages in the last thread and thought that maybe you wanted to get some stuff off your chest. you can vent here to me if you'd like! hope you're doing okay :3
--- 73150951
>>73150884
Not a summer fan, huh? Is it the heat that bothers you or something else? I'm quite looking forward to it, myself.
Right now I'm just playing chess online and trying to psyche myself up to look for sheet music at a low enough level for me to play despite my very very rusty cello skills. What sort of music are you listening to?
--- 73150955
>handsome
>Literally a khhv tranny on hrt 
Your beauty makes boys turn 180 degrees and run
--- 73150989
>>73150951
Have you ever tried having a date where you play the cello for a boy? You know they would love that, very romantic
--- 73151124
>>73150942
What would I do without you... But maybe turn that caring attitude down just a notch, otherwise I'll start believing that you actually do.
And there isn't really much point in venting about stuff now. And I can't really be bothered too. All I will say is that I wish I lived somewhere else, and that this entire side of the continent gets sodomized by sildenafil doped horses and then drenched in napalm and set ablaze.
Do you ever find yourself playing city-builder games? Maybe it'll help you study.
And also, what's your opinion on him? Did you watch his movie (yes I say "his" movie because he totally steals the show)? I wish he was my husband.
>>73150951
Very much the heat. But also the visibility too, darkness is much more serene to me. I personally dislike chess; maybe something to do with the large amount of different pieces. Have you ever played other board(?) games? Also, why do you look forward to summer? Don't tell me that you *gasp* go outside?!
As for the music, I'm not really sure how to describe it, it's like chill hip-hop with an acoustic guitar based beat. Would "Defeated Clown" by Hildur Gudnadottir be too difficult to play?
--- 73151148
>>73151124
>I wish I lived somewhere else,
Hardly anything would change, you would take all your problems with you wherever you go: they're inside your head. 
But surely blaming the continent is easier than addressing your issues
--- 73151315
>>73151124
well i do care about you 'non, you know i do! no worries, sometimes wenting only makes things worse. i hope your struggles will pass soon and if you need any support, you can always summon me :3
i do like city skylines! i play it with my friend occasionally because my computer can't handle it haha, sucks but ehh what can you do. 
if you mean the lego batman movie then i really liked the robin character they portrayed! that movie in general was pretty good! a little silly and unrealistic but it's lego so it makes sense ^^ or did you mean something else?
--- 73151378
>>73151124
I suppose the heat thing depends on where you live, I always like it when there's a very hot summer here but in this country that just means the low thirties centigrade. You're right about the dark, though, I don't want to have to wait until midnight for a decent nightwalk.
I don't really play any other "classic" board games of the likes of go or shogi or whatever, but I do like those big cooperative board games like Eldritch Horror, when the one (1) friend is up for it. What about you, anon? Or maybe card games? They're in the same sort of realm.
Chill hip hop with acoustic guitars is one of my favourite kinds of music. Have you listened to Nujabes? He did a lot of that sort of thing and I used to listen to an unhealthy amount of it.
That piece itself is simple enough, but I think I'd struggle to do Hildur's performance justice at my current level. It would be good to try, though.
--- 73151561
>>73151315
Do you have a favorite city in the world? (sorry if I asked you this already) And yes I was referencing the batman movie. I liked the "silly" parts a lot desu, and it was really wholesome too! I love everything about robin, he's just too adorable to not love.
Hmm, do you have a favorite Ninjago ninja? Regarding their post-movie looks that is. I'm asking this because another adorbz character to me is Jay and his gosh darn freckles >.&lt;
Apologies if I'm prying here, but how did you meet your irl friends?
>>73151378
What's the deal with night walks? As soon as I leave my room I'm waiting to get back into it, because there is currently nothing to do outside of it.
I never really played any of the classic games, including card stuff, but I think there's a good amount of them that wold be fun. Go seems interesting.
>cooperative board games like Eldritch Horror
Had no idea that this existed. Is it something like D&amp;D?
>Nujabes
Never heard of hem before, but I'll check it out right now, so thanks for the suggestion anon!
--- 73151764
>>73149729
He should tell me so we can live together

This made me laugh. Thanks anon &lt;3
>tfw no english bf
--- 73152153
I would sell my soul for an English bf
--- 73152196
all /r9gay/ boys should move to england
specifically the northwest
specifically across the street from me
--- 73152227
>>73152129
I guess something that will make him like his masculine features? Telling him that he doesn't have to go all the way through? But I am not a fan of questioning or changing the contents of people's like/dislike sets. Not sure how possible it is to do so anyway, at least without damaging one's mind. I'd expect him to always harbor those feelings, regardless of what people tell him. Which is a shame, because that probably means -1 twink in the world :(
>>73152153
Me too! ...assuming I had one ofc
>>73152196
Did you wear uniforms in school anon?
--- 73152258
>>73152227
Yes, but I didn't go to a particularly fancy school so it was just a jumper in the school colours over a white shirt rather than a blazer or anything people usually associate with the English school uniform. We could wear polo shirts during the summer though.
--- 73152294
british be like: "oi ya bruv i cant jump wiffout me jumpa on, i dont have a jumping loicense"
--- 73152299
>>73152258
I know this is a controversial opinion, but I think that it's a shame that the kneesocks and shorts combo went out of fashion. Is your house made out of bricks with no facade? Do you like the norfwest?
--- 73152344
I'd be someone English bf as long as they promised to take me out of England desu
--- 73152361
>>73152299
haha holy shit i just looked that up and its so goofy.
--- 73152389
>>73152361
It is eye-catching isn't it :3
--- 73152443
>>73152299
Well, shorts are comfy and easy to wear. But I was an anxious and self conscious kid and didn't like to wear shorts during the summer because I didn't want people looking at my legs.
>Is your house made out of bricks with no facade?
There's a little bit of rendering on the upper front of my house but apart from that it's all brick. I didn't realise that was a thing associated with England desu, do Americans not use bricks or something?
>Do you like the norfwest?
The weather can be a bit shit but the people are nice here. I lived in the south for most of my life but I think I prefer it here
--- 73152562
>>73152443
I still don't like wearing shorts. Maybe if I had less hairy legs it wouldn't be so embarrassing. Although I would enjoy dressing "slutty" for my fbf.
Truth be told, I don't really know if others associate that architecture with the isles, but for me personally it always reminds me of the kinds of identical houses build to act as social housing for factory workers and alike. And I'm no expert on US architecture either, but I do see a lot of plywood-based houses acting as the least common denominator there, instead of ingot-like clay bricks.
>The weather can be a bit shit
So I take it, you don't like the rain?
Do people really call cigarettes the f-word over there?
--- 73152588
>>73152153
>I would sell my soul
There's no need for that. Just go to the apps and arrange a date in public
--- 73152612
>>73152344
How can you be single living in the first world? I don't get it
Do you like, never go out and never meet anyone new in real life? That's the only way
--- 73152635
>never go out and never meet anyone
hello that's me thank you very much does anyone want to be my bf?
--- 73152655
>>73152562
Funny, it's the opposite for me. I really don't grow body hair worth a damn anywhere except my legs and so I shave them occasionally, except I'm not really attractive enough to pull it off.
I've never got why Americans build houses out of wood, desu. Maybe it works better with the climates over there? It's strange to me though.
I love the rain, it's the cold and the grey I don't like. What's the weather like in your part of the world, anon?
Calling cigarettes fags is one of those going out of fashion things that only older people tend to do, but people will know what you mean and not take offense if you call them that.
--- 73152661
>>73151561
my favorite city... that's a really good question! i am obsessed with ancient Rome and Constantinople, but not everything has been preserved of course... i think i'll say London, that city is the staple of human design in my opinion ^^ do you have one too bunny?
it was really wholesome yesh! i don't really know much about ninjago desu... i did always like Kai a lot, but that's mainly because of his color. i do think i have all the ninjago characters! they came in a really cool lego set (pic included)
no worries, prying is always okay ^^ my actual friends i met in primary school. we clicked and kept up with each other ever since! my best friend (who's also my crush) i met through 4chan which is super cool! we met up a bunch together and he's great. do you have any noteworthy friends bunny? i really hope so because you deserve it sm. seriously, i really hope you can find happiness soon. also, my question for you, what country would you like to move to? :)
--- 73152665
I must remember to not look at femboy or twink twitter profiles that feature body pics. I get so desperate if I do...
--- 73152672
>>73152665
How about you look over the dating apps and find someone near who you could actually date?
--- 73152700
>>73152661
>my best friend (who's also my crush) i met through 4chan which is super cool! we met up a bunch together
Does anyone believe this?
--- 73152719
>>73152635
Anon I think lots of boys here would like to be your bf but they're just like you, scared, secluded, shackled by their mental illnesses, unable to open their hearts to someone real. That's why they only feel comfortable flirting anonymously. They'll never bridge the gap and get to you. 
That's why you need someone who lives close to you, and who is open to a real relationship. You can find these people over the dating apps
--- 73152741
>>73152719
how much you get paid for this?
--- 73152778
>>73152741
I do it because I love you silly gay celibates I want to save you from your worst enemy: yourself
--- 73152813
>>73152778
Holy shit. I remember you. You were here like months or even a year ago.

I was really hoping you'd of killed yourself. You're an evil person. People here want relationships and you direct them towards hookups.
--- 73152834
>>73152813
He's been here for three years. You should probably ignore him.
--- 73152872
>>73152834
I stopped coming here for a while, has it really been that long? Jesus. You're right, I will. Just annoys the shit out of me.
--- 73152917
>>73152813
>People here want relationships
Only on the surface. What they really want is to self commiserate, to drown in self pity and to feel sorry for themselves, while doing nothing to change their lonely situation. 
>Towards hook-ups
Dating apps are whatever you make of them. They're not only for hookups, that's up to you, not the app. They're just a tool to meet other gay people in your vicinity.
--- 73152937
>>73152813
>People here want relationships and you direct them towards hookups.
Let's do a thought experiment for one single moment
Let's say you're right, and dating apps are 99% hookups. Don't you think that's still better odds of finding a bf rather than in here, where the chances are 0? 
You say you want relationships and yet you do nothing to get one. How come?

In various kinds of logic, this is what is known as a "contradiction". *licks you*
>It's strange to me though.
I think I prefer concrete over both brick and wood desu.
And the same goes for coldness and grayness too I think. But I think it's normal to not like them though, so don't worry nonny. Sadly however the weather here has been getting warmer and warmer as the years go by. That's my impression of it at least. Sometimes it can get real windy, which I find cool. And for some reason this entire month has been full of rain! So that was a pleasant surprise I guess.
As an English boy yourself, would you like having another English boy as your bf?

Interesting that you picked London over more romance like places such as maybe Madrid or former apennine city-states like maybe Florence for instance. What appeals to you about London specifically?
As for myself, I think prefer individual buildings over cities, but if I had to pick one, then maybe something like Shanghai or Seoul would come to mind. Hong Kong is cool too, but a tad bit to tropical for me. I also always liked the contrast of the desert terrain and the urban buildings as featured in some US cities. Most notably those two light bulbs on the coast of California. Oh and Boston is also really cool!
That is such a pretty set btw. I think all the movie sets that lego offers are exceptionally well crafted.
*sigh* I thought it would be one of those things where you went to the same class or school. Seems it's easier to make friends as a kid than an adult for many. Also, lucky you for finding a bff through 4chan; but I think it's not as uncommon as it may appear (>>73152700), all you gotta do is live in the first world and be an online type of guy I think.
I sometimes hang out with my brother and that's it. I don't know if I know how to do friendships. And I'm weird as heck. I don't know what to tell you, but I think you're giving me too much credit there. And I think you know it too :|
I'm not as picky when it comes to where I'd like to live, compared as to where I wouldn't like to. If that makes sense. I'd like living somewhere where I could easily communicate, so places like the US or Canada (bu there's a bunch of other anglophone countries out there). But it would be very appealing living somewhere "cold and grey" too, so like Finland or Norway seem nice too (and I hear that english isn't that uncommon there either).

That's only a problem if you are unwilling to date another ugly boy.

Absolutely, but I'd also date someone less attractive.
--- 73153538
>>73153513
Then why exactly are you single? 
If you were really willing to settle down, you'd have a bf by now. 
When was the last time you've been to a date?
--- 73153586
>>73153124
Hey, I won't say it doesn't work to my advantage as to how I want to look and feel, but there's a long way to go before I'm anything close to attractive. But I appreciate the compliment. Does your own body hair bother you, then? If it embarrasses you to have your legs seen like that, why not shave or use a cream?
There is a sort of melancholy appeal to concrete buildings, but I tend to just find them a bit bleak, personally. Each to their own, though, it would certainly be easier to live in cities if I could appreciate that sort of architecture.
I absolutely love it when it gets really windy, it's invigorating. I almost don't mind the cold that way.
I'd like to have an English bf, but that's mostly out of convenience rather than anything else. A long distance relationship sounds awful, and I wouldn't want to move permanently out of the country.
--- 73153733
What on earth do I have to say to convince you to go out and have a date with someone irl?
--- 73153852
/nightride/ on my hq bike after a rough day was exactly what i needed. In moments like that i feel alive. I love the city at night
--- 73153864
>>73153586
I don't really believe that I could ever get a bf, so any trait of mine that I find unappealing doesn't hurt as much as it could. That said, my fur coat is probably the most yucky part of myself for me. I can't be bothered to shave it off regularly and all alternatives are too expensive for something that ultimately doesn't matter anyway.
Would it be fair to say that you like your family and stuff? You do strike me as a big hearted bloke, which is kind of endearing. You a member of the hiking club itt? What would you be looking for in your non-long-distance bf (other then that he move in with you)?

--- 73154028
>>73153959
yeah it is what it is
my grandmother always said bad things happen in threes so I'm kind of waiting for the third one atm
I think I'll go for a walk now before it gets dark, and then watch LOTR or read through a LOTR artbook later, picrel 
Just want to get away from life for a while you know 
I listened to sad music last night, I think it relaxed me enough for a better sleep
--- 73154047
>>73153140
yeah it's definitely a little unconventional, but i love what that city represents through its rich history. the different generations of architecture, the grandeur vs the slums, the classic and modern stuff, it's all very interesting. it's kinda hard to explain ^-^''
i definitely do agree that individual buildings are a lot cooler to rank! whats your favorite one in particular? :) Boston is beautiful! i im quite fond of American cities, unlike my classmates
i think you're right on one hand, but it is hard to remain friends with people for that long for many. i think in most cases people will move on and fall out of contact with each other sadly... i personally really like talking to people on omegle! it's a nice way to make friends and meet people so maybe you can try that! heyy maybe we'd meet, how cool would that be? :D (you could use the rags r9komegle and omegle9k if you ever wanna check it out, pretty friendly people there ^^) 
>you're giving me too much credit

Ahh, now that's a familiar feeling. I'm sorry you're uncomfortable with yourself like that, anon, but I'd still recommend you treat yourself and shave if you think it would make you happier. It's really only the first time shaving after not doing it in months that takes forever. Even if you've nobody to do it for but yourself, it does all matter, right?
>You do strike me as a big hearted bloke
Aw, that's kind of you, anon. But honestly I'm just trying a little harder to be decent than usual. You strike me as someone who comes across his light naturally.
A hiking club? I didn't realise we had one of those. Maybe I'm around at the wrong hours.
As for what I'm looking for in a bf, I don't know, it's not something I give too much thought to. I just want someone who will be patient with my kind of slow self and likes me enough to drag me out of the house once in a while, desu. What about you, anon, what is your hypothetical bf like?
--- 73154344
>>73154028
Well I hope that it stops at two, seeing as that is already way too much. And if it really must go for another one, then I hope it's something trivial enough for you, like your spoon handle falling into the soup.
I wish you a pleasant walk and watch/read anon! Maybe you could play some LOTR inspired vidya to completely shut off the world?
Also, comfy looking blanket you got there. And cute fingies too :3 *lick* *lick*
>>73154047
I think I get the idea, or at least a bit of it. It's an old and giant city, that happened to interact with many parts of the world, so it's design espouses some kind of global zeitgeist documenting a good portion of humanities existence.
Glad to hear that you like Boston too! I like atmosphere of the New England region a lot, it might even be my favorite part of the US.
Your comments on friendship do ring true I think, loosing touch with your friends upon going to college has to be one of the most common things I've heard online :c
As for omegle... I don't really like showing my face (or any other body part) at all. And therefore don't even have devices capable of that. Interesting to hear that you use it. But on further consideration it seems to be absolutely in-line for your character. What better way to meet, almost as viscerally as in person, all the different specimens of gods creation and make new friends than randomly linking up through a portal from the comfort of your room.
>idc honestly
You were not supposed to say that... I don't have anything to say in response to it D: Other than to remind you of that time when I mentioned cutting you up and ejaculating on the bare soles of your dismembered feed, that is :3
>they're too socialist for me

Huh, what does that mean? If it's a compliment then thank you lot's ofc!
Maybe the demographic changed in the mean time, but I swear it was once so common for anons to list hiking as something that they (would want to) do.
>who will be patient with my kind of slow self
This is endearing too, but in a sad kind of way... And funnily enough it's a quality that my fbf should also happen to have if he wants to deal with me. Other than that it would be cool if he isn't weirded out by me, and that he likes something at least related to the things which I do, because my whole identity revolves around them desu.

Yeah, I'm too lazy a lot of the time too, but it's something you tend to feel better about once it's done. I get not being able to bring yourself to do these things because of mental health though, that's rough.
I just think you seem like someone who is naturally cheerful and talkative, and I kind of envy that. If I didn't force myself to talk to people, even here, I probably very rarely would, and it's not something I'm particularly good at.
Hiking does sound like it would be fun, certainly a more enjoyable way to get exercise than doing it at home. But then, you weren't much of the outdoorsy type, right? I think I remember you saying something to that effect.
>in a sad kind of way
Well, it is what it is. It's not like I'm dumb or have nothing to offer anyone, but being very much not quick on my feet in social situations is not great. The last thing anyone wants out of a partner is to be made to feel inadequate, or weird, or anything like that. What are these things which you do, anon? You've probably gone over them plenty of times but I don't tend to read other people's long form conversations.
--- 73155099
>>73154658
I totally forgot to answer your building question! I cannot pick just one that I like, but I can give you an idea of the kinds of structures that I fancy. It ranges from the Curtis lecture halls of York University, the Habitat 67 in Montreal, to the Cubic houses in Rotterdam and the Villa Savoye in Poissy.
I've never played the fallout series, it always looked too "empty" for me. But the newer ones do have a bunch of immersive mechanics in them, and apparently feature Boston. Might not be as bad as I thought.
>even though it's really scary i like meeting new people
You're way too innocent and good-natured anon. It makes me think all kinds of bad thoughts. Like you know how a bully might take delight in destroying someone's neatly stacked card house? It's that sort of thing... How ticklish are you btw?
>even though i was pretty upset by it at the time
That's a win in my book! :D ...s-sorry, and sadly there will probably be more of those :C
>i was just making a joke
That makes more sense. Sorry for it whooshing over my head. As mentioned to that other anon, I am rather slow.

--- 73155270
>>73154886
I used to dread the end of the week because that's the time I would shower and shave usually. It's just not worth the effort for me, I'd rather spend time on other stuff.
Hmm, I guess I am talkative in the right circumstances, but I'm not really cheerful that much, at least once you get to know me. I do wish though that anons talked more here, it's a neat way to pass time.
I certainly am the complete antithesis of the outdoorsy type. I personally don't like hiking, but some other anons made it known that they are.
Hmm I am very incompetent when it comes to social stuff, but I happen to have just the right amount of psychopathy to somehow offset that. I was talking more about how much of a dummy I am! And I'm very forgetful and lazy. So all of that makes for a rather under-average cognition process for me. But one of my kinks is being reminded of how dumb I am, so I guess there's a silver lining to it desu

Maybe I really do need someone to hold me accountable, otherwise I just become a slug basically. But being a slug feels sooo good though! I wish that anon still liked me, but of course I had to ruin my only chance of becoming somewhat productive.

you know what else is a novel idea you might enjoy? self hosting a booru to track all of your images across computers and phones, and since mobile devices have booru viewing apps you can easily use it on any device

and then finally, running your own mediawiki instance to collect and catalog all of the knowledge you gain even personal notes/ having pages for people you know. using it as an extension of your brain
>So I don't really wanna discourage it, but I can't help but question the practicality of it compared to, idk, using an instant messenger app
i use telegram and i guess i have discord. but i dont enjoy the instant messenger experience in any sense. conversations are short and shallow by default. imagine never having to give a fuck about ""left on read"" not just you being left on read but worrying about opening messages becoming a commitment. i think part of the answer to your question is im too zoomer to use email
>or maybe in the most extreme case making something like a neocities site for your chats. Why besides the basedness would you get from going through with it?
i like the potential for long term conversations. imagine if you had a board with your friend, and you had a new thread per topic. you could get a new bump on a topic from months ago and the conversation is reignited. you have the best of every world including image dumps to go with it. interlink threads, reference other conversations with a link and a greentext, every single aspect is infinitely more convenient, image boards are supremely intuitive

*yawn* Hello again anon, sorry for my late reply, but I'm a really sleepy ( he means lazy) boy you know? I just can't resist an extra hour or so in bed. Do you use jammies? How do they look like?
Hey! Not everything in that last was brutalism per se. I like all kinds of other styles too. For instance, pic rel is very neat I think. And yes, I do remember your taste for tasteless buildings, but as you say, you're free to like what you like! I guess...
>funny how one's politics influences taste, or is it the other way around? Does art imitate reality, or does reality imitate art??? hint: It's the latter one :3
>what kind of bad thoughts
Now initially I didn't want to divulge too much in an effort to not upset you again, but now I'm thinking that it might be cathartic to express all the fantasies that went through my head. It might also make them less appealing if I don't keep them for myself, something like desensitization maybe. Various forms of inflicting you bodily harm, such as spanking or caning your butt, whipping your back, amputating your limbs, pulling out your teeth, etc. Making you do all kinds of degrading acts, applying piercings and tattoos to you, and humiliating you in front of other people. Dehumanizing you and treating you like a slave. Leaving you restrained for days on end. Breaking your resolve and mind with a combination of sex and drugs.
--- 73163822
>>73160535
And also once fully brainwashed, showing your family what a pervert you've become. Especially your brother, whom I would also like to see you have intercourse with. And probably ending your life with a snuff film in which your convulsions milk someone's pp dry.
Basically all the typical stuff featured in those kinky doujins. I guess the end goal of all of this would be to make you into a masochistic slutty freak (just like me :D)
Sorry if I crossed the line there at some points, but I can't bring myself to lie to you. All of that is of course pure wishful thinking, and although it might make for a memorable instance of self-pleasuring, it just couldn't compete with how ecstatic my heart would be knowing that you achieved joy and happiness doing whatever it is that you like doing. And I don't think that would involve any of the previously mentioned things desu
>are you gonna do anything fun?
None of them are that cool, but I did have two (2) thingies planned for today. Both are, as always, computer related. Kinda looking forward to the second one. What about you? Do you have to go to uni all the time, or can you take a few breaks?
I think I'm very opposite than you on the whole cheek thing. Does that mean I (or anyone for that matter) can get away with doing mean stuff to you as long as it's follow by a "I am sorry"?
And you know, I was thinking and, it technically wouldn't be all that naughty or sinful to, let's say... make you pass out from tickle torture, would it now?

some links you dont have to edit, some you do. i think the system has safe links that arent used to do spam like youtube or maybe news outlets, wikipedia; but everything else gets marked as spam. i think it probably is down to actual spam reduction and raids (like how you cant link discord shit) and potential scams

>forgiveness
well... of course it's not good to let people walk all over me and it's important to have a healthy balance between them (though thats really hard for me to find, i let the former happen too much). say if someone keeps abusing me i don't have to keep hanging around them, but i would definitely like to forgive them no matter what, so feel free to test the limits of that :3

omg... well i appreciate you feeling brave enough to share, and since i know you're not *actually* gonna cause me harm im okay with it. i guess have fun doing whatever you do with these thoughts :3 but know that my resolve will never break!

>You're just making stuff up now nonny. I'm sure many people find your ideas quite intriguing. 
well i guess people think theyre interesting but its hard for anyone to really appreciate them since its difficult/impossible to get people to see any vision of any kind
>Take me for instance! Do you have any other ones to share? I'd gladly listen desu
i have one other idea. well i could tell you about 2 but the other is out of the wheelhouse of a gay thread. but just a few days ago i was told that the nigger thats coding neuro chan or whatever, that AI vtuber, that guy plans on open sourcing the code. this is interesting because if you can run the code yourself for free you can run the code for people to pay as a service
for example the software that runs Wikipedia is called MediaWiki, and its not that hard to set up BUT their are services where you can pay them to set up your mediawiki instance and maintain it like https://www.mywikis.com/ you pay them to run the software for you. (heres a full list https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Hosting_services)

you could take the source code of the AI vtuber and allow individual people to pay you to run it for them in an automated way so they sign up and generate their new AI GF and then pay you on a monthly or yearly subscription to have access to it 
then you pay to advertise it on /vt/ and get a line of customers

I already started being a bit disgusted with what I all wrote to you there, and had honestly thought that you were gone for good... Seems like I'll never learn my lesson :3
I very, very frequently have rather unpleasant dreams. This night it wasn't as bad but still kinda bad. I just don't get why I dream about stuff that I don't consciously think about... But like a day or two ago, I actually had a really interesting dream involving two bunnies! (might have been my first one involving them, believe it or not) I somehow lost them in a shopping mall and was on a quest to find them. And I eventually did! But there was one part of the dream that bothered me a bit. So at one point the two rabbits were about to fall into some kind of vent. Not sure if you know those, but it was pretty much like one of those little elevators for food that they have in hotels. Just this one seemed to not have any bottom or platform in it. And once I saw the buns try to enter it I grabbed them, a bit too forcefully, and pulled them back. So I kind of regret how strongly I pulled on them, and that I didn't really ask for their consent either... Also, I usually have an anthology of dreams during one night. What about you? Do you recall some epic dreams you had?
I don't like telling too many details about my hobby related stuff, but I'll share a bit. I will change a program for another one - that is the first thingy. And the second thingy is that I'll make (or at least try to make) a few programs for... Minecraft! Just messing a bit with some mods and stuff. I personally don't play it but my brother does. I do like the game a bunch, it's filled with stuff to do and is very cute and wholesome desu.

you can use vroid studio to help them create the model theyll use. you can invest and buy assets and since so many assets are made by independent artist it would be easy to get permission to use them for your business, you could have a very big library of customizability. then you could paywall some shit. since a community of people would spring up who would desire various things they see on other peoples models. certain assets would gain popularity 

information for running a server and datacenter stuff to reduce costs could be easily freely obtained by talking to josh moon, SJW of baest, or P. all of those people are easy to befriend and would give you a lot of information on hosting and datacenter stuff. and sjw has friends in open source like lanodan https://hacktivis.me/ thats his site. you could get info from him

if you went through the effort of making an app i belive you could offload a lot of the work onto the users phone since that would be running the model and you would cut a lot of costs and become infinitely more accessible to normalniggers and kids

storing multiple models per user would cost money if they could store an infinite amount. so you could paywall having more than 10 models or something

it could be cool. but im too lazy and not willing to rip people off by giving them e-gfs. wont aid in making men more miserable by enabling it although it would be better than them paying actual women for OF or being paypigs in general

You said there "our" house, is that a world that you play together with your crush on? And did you ever explore the deep dark? I find it to be a bit too scary for minecraft's target audience imo. Ever found an axolotl? Adorable creatures to me. But I couldn't keep them in a bucket or pond, they must be free to swim around wherever they want! I also like sheep a lot too. Idk if I ever asked you this before, but what's your skin ingame? I'm expecting one of those typical gamer girl ones: bright colors, headphones, hoodie, you know.

Good bye r9gay. 

Been here for a while, mostly lurking. Had a few flings and ngl gay sex is probably the most pleasurable sex you can have. It's literally all about pleasure. I'm going to miss getting railed. 

But I've decided that this life just isn't for me. Maybe back when I was desperate and horny and very submissive, but not anymore. I want to start my own family. With my own seed, which I can't do if I'm having some other guys seed lodged up my ass. I'm insanely tempted to have just one more go, but I think we all know it never stops when you promise yourself "just one more"


It's been real. Not sure if I'll ever make it out in the regular world or with women period. I might just die alone, most women will probably reject me the instant they hear I was brave enough to even explore my sexuality a little. Whatever. I just know in my heart that this can't go on. This isn't a long term plan.

>>73166462
But anon, isn't being alone in your room the hardest failure on its own? 
I know your reasoning. "at least I didn't try". 
But that's such a shitty reasoning. You won't fail hard because trying will change you. It will change your life upside down. Even if you "fail " to get a bf, the experiences you will get along the way will be cathartic on their own, they'll change the way you see the dating world, for the better. 
Besides, you're guaranteed to find a bf if you try hard. There's no such thing as a failure, there's only the need for new attempts. You'll get it right eventually. You need hope. That's why this place is so bad for you. 
It's all about draining every bit of hope that you may have

nngg well it is a little disgusting frankly, but im still okay with it and will never just *poof* leave
im glad you could save the bunny! seems like an interesting dream :)
i don't think i can share most of my dreams desu... they're very personal and often involve friends and family. i do actually keep my most interesting dreams in a little journal, it's quite full now! i do actually almost always remember my dreams, and i can also lucid dream! apparently this is quite uncommon too, but i can always control my actions in my dreams. is that something you can do too? 
wowie you make mincraft mods! i don't wanna pry too much but i'd love to see/hear some stuff about the mods you make !

yesh! i am playing on it with him! he's also the best friend i met through 4chan i mentioned ealier btw, im not sure if i told you! i've not been to the deep dark yet, i don't like the scary stuff... i think i found an axolotl once i an old world, i put him in the coral river pretty sure. are you able to kill animals in mc anon? i can never do it, it hurtsss... so i always have a vegan diet

i actually haven't fully committed to a skin yet... if you have any suggestions i'd love to hear it! im currently wearing an Obi Wan one, it kinda sucks ;-;
>Not as innocent as I thought huh? Maybe there's a side of you that you haven't yet discovered anon >:3
well i've never really allowed myself to think about that kinda stuff so maybe you're half-right. but i think im very vanilla anony, i love lovey-dovey stuff like cuddling and kissing, is that innocent enough for you? :3

ah well thats very good, keep yourself pure bunbun! do you have an idea why im kinda an exception to the informal 'receiving end' rule?

Huh I see. No problem then, I know how much you care about those people in your life nony. Are the dreams at least peaceful? Do you ever get nightmares?
The journal thing is very cute I think. Also it's quite feminine to me desu. Does that mean you have a diary too? :3
I very rarely have lucid dreams, but they are much more fun than the non-lucid ones. That is very impressive of you to somehow remain aware enough to get them. I wonder if you unknowingly do something that enables them to happen.
Aaaaaa I didn't phrase it correctly there!!!! I don't make mods! I am just planing on doing something *involving* mods. You know how you can make stuff by using a command block? Well in that case you aren't really making a mod, you're just playing around with a block inside the game. There are mods out there which involve very much the same thing, adding blocks to the game which can be used in a similar way as command blocks can. So that's all it is, I'm basically just having fun messing around inside a mod, and not actually developing one myself. And it's really nothing special in the slightest. I would probably be too embarrassed to share it with people desu

I really don't like the hosts, they're the obnoxious narcissist types exactly like you would expect.

When I was younger I didn't really care too much about hurting mobs, but now I am heavily against exploiting them. So if I did play (which I don't because I feel guilty for playing video games) I would go for a vegan approach too! Now you're gonna be all like "you're just saying this to impress me or something", but you'd be wrong. I can demonstrate my sincere care for minecraft mobs by sharing the results of a little study I conducted recently:
The best vegan food in the game (judging by amount and retention of food points) is the suspicious stew that you get if when you combine two mushrooms and a blue tulip or dandelion, with a bowl in a crafting table. However this food cannot be stacked and and is non-renewable (so it's not guaranteed that you can can get an infinite amount of them).
The second best vegan food stuff would be I think a gold carrot, but seeing as that is maybe a bit challenging to acquire consider either the beetroot or mushroom stew. They are renewable. But sadly also not stackable.
And finally, what I believe to be the most efficient vegan food source in game is, either bread or baked potato. They restore a good amount of food points, and have decent saturation too. You can generate an unlimited amount of them, and can stack them in your inventory providing you with a large amount of hunger restoration on the go. There are ups and down's for both. You need 3 wheat and a crafting table for one bread, but you can't get poisoned wheat. Potatoes can sometimes be poisoned and you require to bake them with something, but that takes only one potato.

>>73166746
And keep in mind that farms grow best when every crop is on and surrounded by hydrated farmland and when no crop is bordered diagonally, or simultaneously on both the X and Z axis, by another crop of that kind. So only plant same crops right next to each other if they go in a one-block-wide straight line. Maybe this part was a bit hard to understand, so I have a visual guide too:
Say you have melons (marked as "o" here) planted as such:
>###
>#oo
>###
The only good way to plant another melon is like so:
>###
>ooo
>###
If you placed them in any other way, like:
>###
>#oo
>o##
or:
>#o#
>#oo
>###
Then not all melons will grow at their best possible rate. So for best efficiency same plants should be placed in either north-south or east-west one-block-wide straight lines!
And remember that one water block can hydrate a 9x9 square around it.
(Also, when I said "vegan" I really meant vegan. Meaning that not animal products where used in those foods, hence why I didn't list what has to be one of the best foods in the game: cake)
Sorry for this autistic interlude, I'll try to refrain from future incidents as such.

>do you have an idea why im kinda an exception
I think it's just due to your goodie-two-shoes attitude and naivety. It's as if you were teasing someone to do naughty stuff to you. I don't know why, but it's hot seeing someone get corrupted in an erotic way.

uhh a chaser is somebody just fulfilling a need like a fetish they dont see people as whole people. theyre chasing a body type or whatever or some ideal. like tranny chasers are just trying to get a gf but whos a male and they think they can get around the dealing with a women and they get the girlcock ideal. so its nothing more than going for an ideal 

boymoding i think is being a troon but not having long hair or attempting to look like a girl but i think you still have to be on hrt. so theyre in boymode. i think girlmodeing is for vagina havers? sill looking like girls?

>>73167917

chaser is person with a fetish for trans individuals. They do not see their partners as their preferred gender.

boy/girl mode is your outward gender appearance. Trans individuals will often go out as their birth gender for various reasons, one is fear or they don't feel like they pass good enough. Secondly is that they may not feel they have been on HRT long enough to go out in public. Others may do it because it's simpler if you need to go out in a hurry.

Honestly its hard to read there and far from ideal but ok. I will probably give you some form of a response, at least partial. I don't ghost but i'm also sure i won't respond to all that. If i give up i will inform you so don't worry. You put a lot of effort into that so not giving any type of response would make me feel bad. Now i also don't know if you would want a response on there or how to so it and shit. I don't wanna make any accounts anywhere. I also don't know when i'll read it and then respond either. I don't feel like doing much these days and that includes walls of text and talking. I feel worse than ever and i there is no good solution for that if any. Even if things went back to how they were it still wouldn't make me happy but i also can't go on like this. So don't hold your breath if you expect me to get better or something.

My bigger brother is the biggest chud you could probably imagine, minus the weak part he is lifting since he was 15, he only watches movies from the 40's because he is against " jewish brainwashing propaganda" aka trans people or mixed race couples in movies. He punched me in the face once because I accidentally used his spoon for my soup.

tankie leftists also play. That way they can fulfill their worldwide commie utopia fantasy instead of the chud's grobgermaniums world conquest.

Darkest hour is very fun if you have the 'tism for it. Much better than the latter HOI games.

He refuses to work and meets his psychologist 2 times a week to get free government money. He also has a gf that was 16 when they started dating, he was 23 at that time around. He told me once that he didn't want a girl that already fucked 100 guys that's why he dated such a young girl.

>tfw no unshowered, slightly smelly bf
--- 73168589
>>73168571

was that legal in your area? Brother or not if it wasn't I would have reported him. I can't stand pedos.

Based. He is gaming the jewish system.
>he didn't want a girl that already fucked 100 guys that why he dated such a young girl
i mean fair enough.
--- 73168609
>>73168589
No it wasn't but he made his relationship public (brought her to mom) when she was 17 

>>73168605
Yeah he is supper happy dude. follow his footsteps.
--- 73168628
>YOU SICK FUCK!!!! SHE WAS 17 AND 364 DAYS OLD YOU SICK FUCK!!!!!! DUDE!!!!!!!
--- 73168636
>>73168609

what did her mom/dad think of this? If you have evidence they were sexually active when she was under the AOC you can still report him to the police.

im not a tankie leftist either, and ive never done world conquest. i might be playing the game more autisticaly than that because i always plan out my colonial goals, then dismantle my enemies and try to break the economy. it sucks vic2 is kind of a shit game when you learn how easy it is to win every war. ive played eu4 and always quit immediately after getting my borders or forming the nation(ive formed netherlands dozens of times) the game is just too long finish
--- 73168646
>tfw no bf to treat me like a teenage boy (despite me not being one)
--- 73168649
>>73168636
No I don't have any evidence. I don't know what their parents think about it, but they know about their relationship. She is studying and he lives rent free in her apartment while he doesn't even have a gas station job.
--- 73168658
>>73168640

Yeah personally I always stick to realistic goals for my country. 

Personally I prefer Crusader Kings the best out of all the paradox games. More of an RPG as you play an actual character rather than a 'country' where you can retain power even after revolutions.
--- 73168684
Hope that anon had fun with LOTR yesterday.
--- 73168697
>>73168649

sounds like he's just a moocher. Sucks for her. I hope she wises up and throws his ass out.
--- 73168717
>>73168697
Yeah tell your mentally ill boyfriend who goes to the gym EVERYDAY that you want to break up. Good luck.
--- 73168727
>>73168609
>Yeah he is supper happy dude. follow his footsteps.
Wish I could. He doesn't have work for a system that hates him infact he gets paid by it. He is in a relationship and is buff. He is winning while you are probably losin desu.

>met guy while online gaming 3 months ago
>was buzzed and lonely, got flirty with him thinking I'm just messing with some online rando
>actually responds to the flirting and we exchange contacts
>play games every day, talk about stuff, tfw no bf and such
>fast forward
>I've grown more attached, perhaps overstepped my boundaries a couple times
>he's not as flirty as the first day, or at all, and doesn't respond to mine
>basically politely lets me understand I'm being too clingy, and wants to keep being friends
I took a step back and we're still gaming and being friendly and that's "good enough" but it hurts knowing he'll likely never reciprocate my feelings
What would you do anons?
--- 73168732
>>73168717

He might be a pussy won't actually do anything but let her go and blubber about how the jews corrupted her. She could also get a restraining order and have him arrested if he tried anything.

>>73168658
ive never played any of the crusader kings games. well, i played ck2 but only for like an hour because it wouldnt stop crashing. just havent bothered to see if it works now. havent felt like playing games much the last couple years so ive never tried ck, or any of their recent games

I didnt end up watching it
When I went to get a snack my dog was having a seizure and I spent a while dealing with that, and then it was too late 
Thanks for thinking of me though
--- 73168780
>>73168728
Stay with him as a friend, and search for a boyfriend. It's not like I can force him
--- 73168784
>>73168766

I would love to watch the LOTR movies again, all in one setting but my ADHD would never allow it. Extended editions too.
--- 73168795
Well me personally I wouldn't take getting broken up with laying down
>oh.
>you're breaking up with me??
>BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG 
>*point gun at self*
>BANG
--- 73168829
>>73168728
>What would you do anons?
I'd peel off my skin because it's "peel-off-skin Tuesday".
Maybe break it off that seems like a torturous dilemma to be in. Or let him know how much you're bummed out by it. Or repress and just be friends.
>>73168766
Does that happen commonly or was it the third bad thing?
Is the puppy alright now? What about you?

Ive never done all the extended in one sitting, I feel like it's not worth, at some point you'd stop taking it all in and just zone out

>>73168829
It happens on and off, he's been on meds to stop them for a while but theyve suddenly started up again this week
I guess because he's growing so much that it changes his needed dose? Vet says we should just up his dose a bit and hope that helps. It's awful seeing him have fits and stuff though, he gets kind of confused and dazed afterwards too. 
I'm meh, it's just another thing to stress about at the moment. I need a break from life.
--- 73168915
It's not enough to love the unreal
I am inseparable from the impossible
I want gravity to stop for me
My soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature

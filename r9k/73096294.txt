I met an absolute Stacy today who said I was cute and sexy and everything because of my face and also because I own multiple guns

She had 0 personality and was a cake face with long fake eyelashes (she would probably look good without all this crap but it didn't wow me as is)

So huh yeah. I figured in the end chemistry matters or something because otherwise it's not even fun, don't even know what to talk about, unless you only want a one night but I would rather have a girlfriend

Guy like me wants a girl who understands me to some degree, I want them to understand that I'm FUCKING Autistic and I don't want to have to put on a facade 24/7.aight

Pretty sure you can't eat that in one sitting because of the sugar, but I would eat it in a day if I'm allowed to exercise.

That's a challenge only for granola girls not for a sweaty faggot with an unwashed asshole like you.

Those are all fresh fruits, so low GI and low GL. If youre healthy youd be fine after eating them in one go.

Do I really have to eat that in one week? If I ate it in a day, wouldn't I get the money?

The nicer you are to people, the worse they will treat you and the worse you are to people, the nicer they will treat you. Why is this actually how things are? What the actual fuck is wrong with people. I have had enough.

what the fuck are you talking about, do you go outside?

The people who are "not nice" are actually just not nice to YOU, which gives you the impression they're like this with everyone else. They're nice to people that matter. Hope that helps &lt;3

I found out you'll get treated well if you just ignore people. don't have to be an asshole, but if you say little and do more, people will respect that. but it's true that you can't be too nice or you'll get beaten down and taken advantage of.

I genuinely want to understand you anon, what do you mean by being nice to people? complimenting them, listening to their problems? what do you do thats nice for others that gets you treated poorly?
--- 73152552
The nicer you are to people, the worse they will treat you 
True except old people and children 
>and the worse you are to people, the nicer they will treat you.
Wrong they will treat you worse unless ofcourse you are a drak triad Chad.

1.Making yourself available whenever they are lonely.
2. Giving them free shit
3. Help them out in their school work or other shit 
4. Picking up all their Calls and responding to their messages.
All of these things devalue you in the eyes of other people.

Kys foid or homofaggot. They're nice to the people that "matter" to THEM
Everyone matters as much as everyone else, except the mentally disabled

nta, but doing this shit just means they're using you and don't give a fuck about you at all from the jump
I used to give my "friends" free snacks and drinks and they weren't there when I needed them
I also used to help girls with their math homework and they also were just using me, but hey at least they flirted with me and stimulated my coomer mind

Saga of use and throw starts when you are being unconditionally nice like that. People actually treat you way better when you keep shit transactional. They don't assume that you are desperate from interacting with them.

Bros we are completely outnumbered by normies, queers and females on this board. Look at the ratio of normal and balanced responses to insulting responses, on this neutral post. Fucking over for r9k.

This is the case with other dudes for me.
I am a 75kg powerlifter and do nogi jj (pretty good wrestler, not the meme bjj guy you are thinking about).
I am a pretty laid back guy, and some random ass nigger will get all confrontational and take up space when i talk to them....what the actual fuck.

The urge to commit murder gets stronger every single day, i'd be a convicted felon if it wasnt for the internet and being able to turn my brain off for a couple hours each day
--- 73152698
Dunno what's wrong with you people but I'm nice to people and people are nice to me back. Still not making any friends or girlfriends but they're nice to me. Obviously it's not everyone cuz there will always be dicks.
--- 73152709
>>73152675
it's definitely getting harder to ignore them. normies are some of the worst people ever.
--- 73152724

They have to come here and punch down at people already at the rock bottom. Maybe being a materialist zombie isn't worth it either.

Its pathetic to see them come here and use exaggerated insults that you can tell are hyperbolic because of how forced or detailed they are. Like:
>>73152532
>>73152541
I think they format it like this because the worse it is, the better they feel about themselves. Its transparency just exposes them for what they are: both spiteful and stupid.

I think of them as different human species, there's no way we both have the same faculties in the brain to choose to act this differently. It's not everyone, just the huge majority of people.
--- 73153581
real i had a friend irl that i treated like crap, made her buy me stuff, ignored her, made her run errands for me and give me rides, and bullied her for being ugly and fat. then one day i thought hey she has stuck with me through all of this maybe i should be kind and repay the favors even though she is a fat retard. WRONG. she started treating me like poop and so i went back to the way things were before.

I think you need to find some better company. It sounds like you're around egomaniacs who are trying to prove their dominance over others.

What do you mean? How is that not being nice? Thats the definition of unconditional support.

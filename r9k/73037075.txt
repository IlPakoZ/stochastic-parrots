I just realized...that I am a Chad! not a 10/10 for sure, but... I am 5'11", really broad shoulders, good muscles and fat percentage (not that it's great), white, broad jaw, my face is not that bad as well I think, I make 8 times the minimum wage where I'm from, I own my house, I have a good car and a good motorcycle, I am a bit smart...just have a really bad social anxiety, but looking back, I get a lot of attention from females. I aways felt like a total outcast, but my life, looks, and health kept improving. I aways thought I was a beta, but now I see I am I mild Chad. That's weird, I get i few girls these days, but I thought it was just me improving, not me being a Chad... When I was 18 (I'm 28 now) I had bad acne, I was poor, fat, afraid of girls and porn addict. Idk how it can help betas, but I was a beta and now i suddenly realized I am a mild Chad and I am just happy with myself (got to sort that anxiety though).

The sole thing truly making you a Chad is girls approaching you first. Everything else is cope.

Based, I also recognize slight improvements I've made over the years. I've had girls interested in me in the last few years who I would have been extremely intimidated by when I was younger. The thing is I didn't feel that weird when they were interested, so I didn't 'feel' the improvement if that makes sense. I'm still pretty retarded, but self improvement is no doubt worth it in the long term. I absolutely mog who I was 5 years ago.

They never approach, but they give hints. I girl will never ask you out unless they are autistic or underage, that is real life

Exactly, I used to think I was average or short, but I see now it's good enough as long as you have a good size, that doesn't make me an actual Chad, but a mild one for practical purposes, and for someone who used to think as myself as beta that's a great improvement. Btw, 99% of women won't see the difference between a 5'10 and 6'2 because they are tiny as hell

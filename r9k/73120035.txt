Meds are meant to numb you, dumdum. If you didn't think anything before, ofc you wouldn't feel anything after. If you really want to feel something, take psychedelics, unironically. They do the opposite and amplify every emotion and sensation rather than numb them. Can be pretty dangerous depending on your headspace, but that's how you feel things if you can't.

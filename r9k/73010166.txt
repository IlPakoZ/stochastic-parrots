All the useless corporate buisness degrees are legitimately useless now . AI can make fancy presentations and crawl the internet for data and research and format it nicely for you . 

How will normies cope once they realize they are useless bottom feeders and I feel bad for those who think UBI will solve anything

So? They were always useless. Who the fuck needs a degree to answer emails and make powerpoints? You act like there's some substance going on at the mid-management corporate level. There isn't and never was. It's been a sham for 400 years, this will change nothing at all.

None of that shit needs to be done in the first place, do you think anyone including the c-suite was actually hoping for it to be automated? The whole corporate structure is inefficient as fuck by design. It's a giant social club to distribute the stupendous wealth we still enjoy being the place every sorry ass thirdie's labor drains into because of magic paper. Chad and Stacey are not intellectually capable of more than that and they will simply take credit for the work the AI does. Same with doctors and lawyers, they will be able to rubber stamp everything the AI produces and churn through more work as needed, knowing the gov will protect their profession from competition with the stroke of pen saying you still need to get services from someone with a 10 year degree.

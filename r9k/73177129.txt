How will the ATF enforce its gun laws?
--- 73177156
Bigger guns I guess.

Why would they? Guns give a flase sense of security to mutts while their government keeps doing anything it wants. It's an Anglo thing to believe in home castle(cuckshed) so he feels like a king in his little box and gun while shit keeps worsening outside.

This is exactly what I and saying. You think your home castle is going to be invaded but it's not the case. They have taken over every institution that affects the zeitgeist. They dont need to come to your house to rape your loved ones aka your kids. They can groom them in the schools or on Internet or with music.

i think it's a comedy that regulates cigarettes and soft drinks but not guns
the american gun lobby is so powerful that the us government and american society will not stop this terrible misjudgment until all innocent american youth is shot dead

I own guns and have a carry permit. This is because:

>niggers exist
>rightoids are violent schizos
>police are useless and/or corrupt

>innocent american youth is shot dead
It has happened many times before and every time its not the gun that shot him it is the individual. If America took mental health care and illegal immigration seriously we would not have a gun problem.

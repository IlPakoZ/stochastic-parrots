got invited to go to dinner before prom with friends this year. every single one of them has a date except me, which means im gonna be the fucking 9th wheel. why is it so hard to be liked? all my friends talk about guys texting them and i can never relate. even after losing 130 lbs and getting down to normal bmi and looksmaxxing i still cant fucking compete. is this my life from now on?

Fuck off with your exceedingly menial and literally childish problems, dumb high schooler. Make sure your GPA is tight so you can go to a university, that's all that matters about HS. You can choose to simply never see any of those people again.

Maybe you could pay a girl to go to the dinner with you ...

Are you familiar with the just-world fallacy? The just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias that assumes that "people get what they deserve". I hypothesize that society drills this idea of objective morality in order to keep the people at the bottom blissfully ignorant. Think about it. This trope is seen in almost every single form of entertainment targeted at children. One example that comes to mind is superhero movies. In these films, the "good guy" always wins. The theme of the movies is literally the just-world fallacy. "Just be a good person, do the right thing, and you will win for sure!" I feel like this almost goes without saying, but children are the most susceptible to this propaganda. That's why the just-world fallacy is most propagated in media consumed by children. The unfortunate fact is that in many cases, this propaganda is successful. Most people go on with their lives, oblivious to the factors that determined their outturning. But some people see the truth, fall through the cracks. They often spend a large part of their life with the wool over their eyes. They think that their efforts are deserving of merit in and of themselves. But they eventually come to realize that they've been lied to their entire lives. They discover the years they spent walking the straight and narrow path meant nothing at all. These people are shattered to pieces when they see some reprobate lowlife indulge in the fruit from which they've hungered for their entire life. 

>Why do they get to partake in the finer things in life? They've been in and out of jail since high school. 
>Why am I deprived of the finer things in life? I've worked so hard and been so honorable. I've held a stable job, kept up with my appearance and physique, and yet I've nothing to show for it.

"This is a cruel world. The only morality in this universe is luck. Pure, blind, unadulterated luck."

your comic says the opposite. the guy fucking your wife is being rewarded for being superior, not luck.

The guy in the comic is getting what he deserves for being a fool.

If you can not breed in your entire life then you're probably really dysgenic or have high standards, the industrial revolution has made it possible for billions more people to exist than actually should exist. Therefore you get a giant pool of people who are by birth inferior, it's not their fault. Nature still somewhat sorts out our breeding in the lower middle and bottom classes of society with our own human instincts. Beautiful women and ugly women alike will always want to have sex with beautiful men, period. Because they're eugenic and deserve to have children. Among the high classes of society if you're dysgenic you can still get a beautiful and eugenic woman though because you have money but she will never truly be attracted to you or enjoy having sex with you.

OP have you tried dating an ugly girl or suicide?

>or suicide

Why would I kill myself? That's the ultimate self-own. My ultimate fantasy is to amass wealth and live comfortably in exile.

Most of them will not realize that, as the replies already show. They cannot bear the blow to their egos that their successes and failures were hugely influenced by sheer chance. This is like normalfag101 here. It is why they allow themselves to be as cruel as they can to the less fortunate, they see them as morally bad because their outcomes are worse, so they must be horrible people right?

Found the mistake. Otherwise, that guy has a much more fulfilling life than that of Chad. Fucking, especially without connection, ain't that great once you get it.

COPE. Who is more "valuable" to society? Who defines what is more valuable?

If you asked a billion women on who they would prefer. Every woman, that was being honest, would say that they prefer the CHAD.

>"valuable"
>women
Why are you projecting those spooks on my post? First guy still has a more intrinsically fulfilling life. I would rather be him than hedonistic Chad personally. I have fucked girls without caring about them. Ain't that great.
--- 73169765
>>73169715
>>73169744
Just to clarify, I'd rather be a man with a sense of purpose than an hedonist and not for anyone else's benefit but mine.

>>73169765
Brother, why do you think these men "have a purpose"? These people have this contrived idea that they can "get back at chad" by getting their stem degree and making money. But what ends up happening is these guys wife up chad's half-eaten meal that's been rotting under his bed for 6 years.

You don't have to be ugly to have a purpose. These chads go wild in college, totally neglecting studies in exchange for stacy. They then graduate somehow, then get hired as an investment banker for 300k/year. You gotta get it through your head that chad literally can not lose at life.
--- 73169902
>>73169869
Never said you can't be Chad and have a purpose. I pointed out that between the two men depicted in the comic, I'd rather be the first one. He doesn't seem driven to accomplish things to get back at Chad. Going for the girl is just one of his many pursuits. And that Chad is depicted as degenerate and hedonist.

Why do you guys keep projecting your stuff on my post?

Yeah, I deally I'd wanna be Chad with a purpose. Barring that, I'd rather be a guy with a purpose than purposeless Chad.

cope sneed feed dilate and touch grass. the rule for women is "watch what they do not what they say". when you've sucked off a dozen indian and chinese guys at the STEM departments of the nearest university, then we'll know you're not a slut for abusechad.
--- 73169943
>>73169927
>women
Again, why do you judge everything by what's attractive to them?

For me: having a sense of purpose >>> getting pussy

That's all I'm saying. If I can get both, great, but if I have to pic, I'd rather be the first guy. What is so hard to understand?

If you want to get a girlfriend then you can find a good one, contrary to what virgins in the internet think there is good ones. But if you don't want one or instead want to devote your life to pursuing a passion then take that path. I think you shouldn't hinder yourself with regards to what you actually want, you only have one life and to waste it proving a point or doing something you don't want to do would be a great mistake. Always be honest to yourself above all, the only things you truly have ownership of in this world are your mind and body.

Best of luck anon!

Why isn't anyone actually reading my posts before replying to them?

Thanks for the sentiment, though.

What's the point of replying to a post you haven't read? Don't reply to this question, it's rhetorical.
>>73170131
>having a purpose
>being miserable
Those things are usually contradictive, anon. Unless you're confusing having a purpose with things that are done because they look good to others.

Why are you wrapping your purpose around the the vagina? Work on yourself, and in the meantime crush pussy. Stop trying to find true love in hs/college, life isn't anime.
--- 73170203
>>73170183
Please explain how I wrap my purpose around vaginas with quotes. Once again, it feels like I'm talking to bots who don't really read what I post.
--- 73170253

>What's the point of replying to a post you haven't read?

Because I don't have any friends or people who I talk to.
--- 73170267

You're not talking to anyone but shadows in your mind when you decide to reply without reading. This is probably part of why you have no friends. Pic-rel is me, btw.

If it encourages people to keep trying to always do the right thing, I don't see anything wrong with letting people believe they get what they deserve.

These comics (Black Pill Comics) are made by EurasianTiger as a demoralisation campaign mostly targeted at white men, and also out of rage towards Asian women for fucking white men (he also hates his wife, who is Asian).

Anyway, regarding the Just World Fallacy: basically everybody believes in it, and challenging it in front of normalfags throws them into a borderline psychotic rage. If you imply that people don't deserve what they have, it's almost entirely circumstance and luck, normalfags get incredible mad without understanding why. Simply, if people deserve the good things that happen to them, that means people deserve the BAD things that happen to them too. Pedro, being skinned alive in front of his daughter who is being raped with a baseball bat in Mexico right now? He deserves it, just didn't work hard enough. Pajeeta, who has cancer from trawling through electronic waste all day? Deserves it, shoulda gone to college.

People are just psychopaths.

Its even funnier when you try to tell incels that Chad is successful because of luck and not because he is chad. Literally anyone can have as much sex as chad, its just blind luck and has nothing to do with merit. Incels still believe that intelligence or looks are important in life.

Being a "Chad" is luck in its own way, just being born to the right parents with a good genetic background. What opportunities are open to you is entirely luck. Some people can work their entire lives, but they don't have the capacity for certain things due to genetics or circumstances. The entire system we live in is entirely predicated on the idea that ANYBODY can "make it" if they "try hard enough", and people will point to "self-made millionaires" and such as examples of this, which is just a survivorship bias.

By saying that Johnny Self-Made is rich because he DESERVES IT and WORKED HARD ENOUGH, you are effectively saying that everybody who isn't rich deserves to be poor. Even people who have worked harder, longer hours than Johnny Self-Made don't deserve it for whatever reason, or Johnny just deserved it more. It's complete insanity, but it's insanity you have to believe to stay somewhat sane.

Thats not luck anymore if you can predict that chad gets rewarded for being better, thats called just world fallacy

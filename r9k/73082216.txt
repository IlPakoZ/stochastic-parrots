Insane levels of narcissism are not uncommon in women. Tending towards hating or loving something based on how it suits them with little objectivity or other reasoning and with casual disregard for other people, often very observable in a lack of manners (manners are one of the biggest flags in a relationship). You gave her the ick so she sees you as dirt and will spread petty gossip about you.

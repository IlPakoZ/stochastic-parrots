I like 4chan because I can say faggot and nigger and call things gay and retarded and nobody minds. I can be free to be as silly as I want without the fear of being lectured to or pompously mocked by some nerd. And being anonymous is really freeing. I can say some wild shit if I'm in a weird mood and just let it pass when I'm over it. It won't say with me. Because that's life. You live through moments, but you're not always feeling that same way. It's the best forums on the internet.

Sometimes they do. I have been banned in the past for saying these things. It's shit, but it's slightly less shittier than other places.

Based, I hate how retarded our culture has become. The main purpose of making 'taboo' words is so normies can virtue signal and harvest easy status for doing something that's extremely easy to do. It's probably one of the dumbest things that exists

THIS IS A MESSAGE TO SHERIFF MIKE CHICKWOOD. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT MIKE, YOU.
IF I SEE YOU IN PERSON I WOULD PERSONALLY APPROACH YOU, ASK PERMISSION TO SHAKE YOUR HAND AND SAY "GET 'EM PARDNER".

THAT IS ALL.

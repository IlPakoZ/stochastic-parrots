Harems are the natural state of humanity. But because of a lack of wars we don't have the right any longer. Sad really.

>Number of members
The more the merrier.
>Their personalities and race/appearance
Nice, some super submissive. As many races and body types as possible.
>Uniform (if any)
Cute dresses for the higher ranking ones, loose rags when cold or nude for lower ranking slaves.
>How are household chores divided up?
By skills but this should get easier the more I get.

I wish I had two girls, one for each arm to lift up and kiss and fuck together as really close fuckbuddies. I don't think that'd count as a harem but it'd be really fun. I can't be spread too thin, I just want fun friends I can fuck.

Two girls is harem, sort of.

>Number of members
3
>Their personalities and race/appearance
Outgoing/introverted and a mix of the two, race doesn't matter to me honestly, all be slim
>Uniform (if any)
Dependant on the day, they'd have an outfit for every day sorted and arranged. A new set every week which I'd approve
>How are household chores divided up?
Whatever each member prefers doing, aside from dishes, which will be an efficient assembly line of me washing up (I only trust myself to full get stuff clean) drying up and putting away. The third wife is in charge of music.

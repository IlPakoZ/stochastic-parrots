how do i make her my wife?
--- 73141649
>>73141592 (OP)
don't go too fast
there's a reason the person is in r9k, if their mind is not rotten yet then you're fine
trying to "save a person" is really tougher than it sounds, and dealing with a person's problems is tiring if they are not willing to work on them
--- 73141650
>>73141592 (OP)
Women from r9k universally ghost or block dudes after about 1-14 days. They're here for a reason and you'll likely never meet her if she lives far away or something.
--- 73141657
>>73141650
in my case he ghosted me
--- 73141681
>>73141650
Where was this post literally 14 days ago. I just got ghosted I am never trying that shit again, they are fucking snakes. Happy and flirty right up to the moment they want nothing to do with you like what the fuck?
--- 73141683
>>73141592 (OP)
Just date her you pussy

Show bobs and vagene next time. Come to Delhi I make you happy bride yes?
--- 73141694
>>73141657
did you say more than "hi" and "lol" during your conversations?
--- 73141706
>>73141592 (OP)
There's a very real possibility that your dick won't save her, but her pussy will make you worse, so keep that in mind
--- 73141712
>>73141693
this but unironically. girls here would never have to look for anyone if they just sent one dude bobs and vagene
--- 73141716
>>73141657
i think that by "women" he refers to humanoids that are female at birth. do you check this requirement?

I won't even attempt to talk to a supposed femanon unless they live in the same city as me
I've still not seen 1 supposed femanon on r9k say they live in the same city or state as me though

I live in a pretty medium sized city (over a million residents) but rarely see anyone on 4chan say they live here, male or supposed femanon
Actually just looked it up and there's a lot less people living here than I thought..I thought my city had at least over 5 million residents, but the whole state only has around 3 million

I've honestly not seen many anons who're from Florida, which is a very populated state. The demographics of this board are surprisingly spread out and diverse.
--- 73141979

Does being aloof actually do shit? I figure it'd just make your time getting close to someone harder.

it does if you're chad. if you're an ugly beta loser, they never notice your lack of attention
--- 73142031
>>73142005
There used to be a tagmap for /r9k/ but it was so old and full of dead postings. 
>>73142020
So basically it does jackshit(or worse) because of course someone's going to try hard for someone they find physically attractive.

I talked to one for 4 years but we argued and ghosted each other till she added me again multiple times and in hindsight, I regret ever speaking to her or "e-dating". For any robots reading this who want to talk to girls, make an Interpals account and you can have interesting conversations with girls who'll give you a ton of attention and who won't ghost you from all over the world.

I don't speak to Jap girls desu and yeah, most people there want to talk on whatsapp or insta, not Discord lol. But I do talk to quite a few on Discord too, I think it might just depend on the country, anon

She's Mio and she's an OC of the artist Murohani Poco, I believe.
There's a language exchange VRChat server?? That's so cool! It's true that I did meet some people who spoke other languages on VRChat before. 
What is your favorite Japanese media anon? How much time do you spend studying Japanese every day?

this is their discord. i haven't joined vrchat in a while but it's pretty active there and the people are nice. there are a lot of japs but also other asian/european/american people learning the language. some have difficulty introducing themselves and others will mog even politicians.

>What is your favorite Japanese media anon? How much time do you spend studying Japanese every day?
anime probably. haven't read a lot of manga or untranslated literature. i was consistently going 4h/day for a a bit more than a year. now i'm at a point where i need to speak to others to improve or read hard texts, but slacking. dropped out of uni because i didn't like it and want to start diff major (180 turn), so trying to prepare. i'll surely pick jp up again and want to visit the country. somewhat weeb at heart.

It's universally EVERY woman. Stop the cope that there's a woman out there who is different, who actually prefers a manlet, who actually don't mind you balding, who actually loves you despite you making less than $100k a year and not being famous. Just stop, at best she will settle after she's done riding cock carousel and resent you for not being who she feels she deserve. Women are a hivemind, they have no personal opinions, no personal preferences. It's whatever hivemind finds attractive, whoever is popular, whoever is desired by other women.

And who the fuck are you? I'm describing the universal template for the woman hivemind not your personal status since it's irrelevant. ALL women want the same type of a guy I described. Tall, popular, "confident", +$100k a year. And they will resent you if they have for some reason settle with you and you're not that. Best part is, even if you are all of the above they will still divorce rape you.

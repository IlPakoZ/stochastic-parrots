How did you get through medschool?
I'm studying Compsci and remembering stuff is hard. I'm smart but my memory is bad if that makes sense.
I am doing an internship and get some work experience from there but I struggle with the theoretical subjects where I have to recall from memory.

i have hard uneven lumps inside my foreskin. they dont hurt but i can feel they are there sometimes. they showed up little over a week ago, swelled and has since shrunk some but are still there. its not so much one lump as much as a cluster without a specific shape. i tried prodding but after breaching the skin nothing came out, no blood, nothing.

I've got acne deep beneath the skin, probably cystic, and I can't stop scratching it. I look like a meth addict, constantly covered in scars. Is there anything I can do other than take accutane? I didn't want to take it because of the potential side effects.

I'm half convinced vision has slightly deteriorated in my right eye, dexterity has slightly deteriorated in my right hand, and the joints and muscles on the right hand side of my body feel tighter or shorter or less flexible, noticeably my neck
I might just be paranoid hypochondriac.
It seems to come and go.


Should I be worried?

Why are MDs in general so dogmatic when it comes to taking NDEs seriously? Because NDErs are convinced by their NDEs, and at least some of them understand the hallucination theory as well as MDs do.
>b-b-but NDEs are dreams or hallucinations somehow
Already explicitly refuted in the literature you likely have not read on NDEs.

Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:

https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]

It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 

>"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."

Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.

Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:

>"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."

Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.

its evolution
when you experience massive pain your body literally numbs it all and you stop feeling it
when you experience a traumatic exprience your mind blocks it so you dont remember it
when you are dying it does the same, if while dying you actually experienced the utter fear of death and started panicking it would be hard for others to help you, so your body induces you into a hallucinatory state so you are calmed and have more chances of surviving

welcome to basic biology

Have you ever considered just being really sweet and honest with a girl? No ego, no lies, no pretension.

It actually worked. Some girls like shy guys. It just took a little bit for me tk open up

I'm always polite and honest, but I don't know how to be "sweet". I think that if I start being "sweet" out of the blue I will come across as a creep, even though I know that's improbable and most people like compliments.

Being honest is easy if you're not a sick fuck like me. I just have so much to be ashamed of relative to normal, healthy people, it's not fair. Why do I have to live paranoid and closed off? The wages of sin are death and hell exists on earth.

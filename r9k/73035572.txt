Just take it slow. If you fail parallel parking you can still pass. Worst thing you can do is panic and go too fast, forget stuff. Worst case scenario you fail and have to retake, not a big deal. Good luck, it's really freeing being able to drive. &lt;3 Report back for head pats when done.

I need to do this as well but I don't have a car to practice, and I can't buy a car because I can't drive it home lmao. My plan is to wait for vacations and do it with my family's car back home. I won't pay 1k for a driving school while my father should have done that when I was a kid.

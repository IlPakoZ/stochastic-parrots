I managed to lose all my friends and relationships in one month. For all of you that have been friendless for years, how do you cope?

>how do you cope?
I don't, I'm a miserable shut in and have been for many, many years. On a real note, talking to people on 4chins and discord helps, but it isn't a proper replacement for real relationships. I need to stop being a shut in badly and make real relationships.

I feel your pain brother, I don't just burn bridges I put dynamite charges on them and blow them to rubble. Don't do it intentionally, I just ruin every friendship I ever happen to make. I hope you have good memories at least of the friendships you managed to have in the past

i speak to people online and mostly got used to it.
helps to sort of 'grey man' and be as generic as possible offline so you don't risk being found out as a weirdo.
also i had a bunch of spergout episodes that was virtually social an-hero, but i moved state and came back after like a decade. there's still a risk someone might know someone i knew, but the impact of such an event is now significantly lower.

23 here, I've been friendless since middle school. I just immerse myself in my hobbies and read books and shit mane, not much else you can do. Stop being anxious about it and learn to be comfortable with yourself. Being /fit/ helps a LOT with confidence and self-image while you're isolated btw, I was deeply depressed and self-hating when I was a fatty.

Me err. I flood my brain with anything I can get that provides dopamine. Drugs, games, books, food, shows ect. I now am uninterested in maintaining friendships. Feels more peaceful honestly.

You'll be a lot happier if you get /fit/. The ego boost is unreal and people will treat you better (although it doesn't help with making friends/getting gf). Also post-workout endorphins literally make me hard sometimes, feels good man

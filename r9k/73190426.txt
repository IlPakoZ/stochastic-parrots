Thread for those that have lost all hope in having a normal life one day. By normal life I mean having a job, friends, sex/girlfriend, etc. Let's use this thread to talk about how we are feeling and also to help each other with advice from people that really know how we feel.

Previous thread: >>72069762

Thread initial subject: where do you see yourself when you are like 50?, do you think that you will be doing more or less the same things that you do now?
--- 73190448
is this the glowie datamining/grooming thread?

When I'm 50? I'm coming up to 31 and praying I get the courage to neck myself before that.
--- 73190516
>>73190448
don't high road the feds, hikkineets serve zero purpose, nothing remotely relevant to "datamine" lol

>>73190458
But most likely you won't be able to do it so where do you see yourself at 50?

If killing yourself was so easy then we would have 100k suicides each day. The reality is that it isn't that easy.

i don't really care for the thread topic so i'm just gonna vent...

i have a wagie job but deep down i fear that i'll never be able to move on from that. maybe at best i can be a team lead. also i had this down syndrome gf who broke up with me and im thinking if i should text her back or not.

Never text a girl back unless you're in a NOTORIOUSLY better position than when she last saw you, and when you do it, just fuck and dump her, she'll be on her knees begging you to take her back.

>>73190583
does her having down syndrome make it any different? she's also 5 years older than me so i assume i hold an advantage over her, right?

>where do you see yourself when you are like 50?
doing the same thing which is in 18 years from now, im 32

>do you think that you will be doing more or less the same things that you do now?
asumming nothing changes, yes, i do. im autistic and reclusive. its basically over. its really brutal

but things will change, because of the singularity and super-ai. it will radically change the world. its why im alive, it gives me so much purpose in life. schaudenfreud from seeing normies get their jobs automated. all of them. all the smug nt cunts get their meaning and purpose cut out. its going to be SPLENDID

but otherwise, these days i think a lot of about philosophy and god. i think about god everyday

i used to do vegan outreach on these boards, but i grew to hate the people here so much. upon further reflection, it seems as if its not correct for me to judge them, and i should continue it

you know, its really hard to forgive people when they smugly hurt you. i hate people on a visceral level, so deeply and so passionately

but i respect sound logic so much. its simply not for me to judge them, its for god. just that simple.

I wouldn't date a girl with down syndrome so no idea, seems a little abusive, buuuut also a little mean to imply that people with down syndrome can't have sex or love without it being abusive.

I have no clue what to do so I'll refrain from further elaboration.

I cannot imagine I'll be alive then. I'm struggling to even picture it. I guess if I'm still alive I'll be in he exact same position I am now. Hopefully I end up homeless before then and that pushes me to fucking kill myself before that happens, though.

I don't think big important things will happen until like the 2100s or later. Maybe all you will see is better fake photos and things like that, fake videos, fake voice, fake text, but not Skynet

I have no direction in life or any genuine interest in anything. I literally just exist, and find pointless distractions and ways to pass time while I slowly grow older and closer to death.
Nothing in my life went particularly wrong, either. But if I look back, this is where deep down I always knew I'd end up. I guess I was broken from the start.

I will be dead long before 50.

I just don't understand whores these days man, it's like the older and fatter they get the more entitled they feel to your things. And once they've inevitably betrayed you over this ever expanding sense of entitlement they expect you to fix the trust they fucked up. Like it's your fault.

Even if you lose your virginity this is what you have to expect. Women can't be monogamous to save their lives anymore, and will use their smelly snatch like a weapon the moment they don't get their way. And there's always some pathetic simp on standby just waiting to lap up the slop from one of these loose slags.

>where do you see yourself when you are like 50? 
i dont. never have.
>do you think that you will be doing more or less the same things that you do now?
if i do that would be so pathetic its unreal.

i dont know what to do with my life anymore. only thing i feel passion and drive for is abusing substances but it causes so much cringe and economic despair. tolerance is also a motherfucker, by the end of my drinking binges i drink amounts that kill normal people but i still feel like shit. needing six beers just to not feel like your anxiety is going to kill you is no way to live but being sober is just miserable since i cant be normal either.

>he thinks ai will harm normgroids
The system will change radically to compensate for normies if anything happens to them, the neolib oligarchs know exactly how much suffering they can get away with before true destabilization occurs. They can harm and abandon losers like us because nothing will change, allowing the harming of normies could disturb the herd as a whole and cause a stampede, if you will. 

Neoliberalism is essentially the perfection of the balance between suffering and profit.

>allowing the harming of normies could disturb the herd as a whole and cause a stampede, if you will.
but heres the neat lil' trick. the herd wont stampede if they are under the impression that nobody else is running. 
they'll want normies as miserable as possible without something is up, easy thing to do when everyone think everyone else is happy. nobody wants to be one of those miserable losers who complain all day.
because if people are miserable they'll spend more money.

The best thing that could happened to us is to not have children. Imagine your shitty life but add to that having a little kid that depends on you economically and psychologically, imagine being a kid and having a father like us. Thank God that I didn't have children.

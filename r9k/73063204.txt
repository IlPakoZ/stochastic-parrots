As long as it is a decent church then whether you believe or not the camaraderie will help you heal and grow. Actual Christians are pretty based people, even if they are not my type. 

What are your plans from here? With no support network in friends or family, what do you plan to do with your life?
--- 73063448
>>73063383
please point me to the nearest ripper sir

>>73063403

Kek, but also fucking terrifying. Glad you got out. Hopefully you can get your life on track and make the most of it now you got out whilst still young. Take some time to settle, get some money under you and maybe explore community colleges or a trade to find what you want to do in life. 

Best of luck!

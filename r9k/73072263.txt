This book does not in any way agitate for violence against women. Why would so many women try to silence a woman who criticizes them for manipulating men? Any person who is intellectually honest can see that women manipulate men all the time.

Because woman don't value truth or justice like men do , simple as. Nor can they be trusted to uphold it or be fair and treat everyone fairly. They always have an ingroup preference

I think every man on the face of the planet should have to read Vilar's book as a basic part of growing up, and I think bratty immature reason should have to read it 100 times as a punishment.

I think a lot of men might want to look into why a book that
>Does not agitate violence against women
>Does not claim that women are inferior 
>Does not say anything whatsoever about women genetically
... was banned from Amazon. The book is just a list of manipulation tactics women use to control men, essentially. Why, exactly, was this considered so controversial it had to be banned?

Women have their own code of conduct which they hold themselves and their peers to. For a woman to step out of line and sell these secrets is beyond unacceptable. In a social setting, she would be brutally ostracized, but in this context all they can do is screech at book sellers to get Vilar's work off the shelves.

That'd actually fucked up. Amazon used to be very, very lenient. There was basically nothing that was banned, except for a very few works on the kindle store. If they are now banning such generic stuff like this, they'll open the flood gates and anything transgressive will start to get yanked.

The author is a woman right?

Yes, that is the case, she is a woman.

Because we live in a matriarchy under the guise of equality?

Duh , obviously, it's never been a patriarchal, it's been a cunt dystopian tyrannical shit hole

So couldn't this be seen as a book that supports female empowerment?

Rollo Tomasi and most "red pill" authors completely plagiarized this woman. Her work flies under the radar.

Well, yes, but why do women fight tooth and nail to prove that they're "oppressed" somehow (LOL) when all evidence proves that they're actually a privileged as FUCK class in society?

It was written in 1971 and was seen as a very slightly spicy sociological work. Not even remotely closely on the same level as even a typical Jordan Peterson book. Like, zero outcry or legitimate controversy. More of a dinner party conversation piece like "The Dice Man". The fact that it was banned lends massive weight to the idea that perhaps this book is authentic in what it lays out.

Well men are a lot more free from the matriarchy now than in the past. If this was 100 years ago, you would slaving for some woman.

It was a patriarchy in the 50s, but in recent decades the point of equality which feminism claims to want has been long since passed. 
>>73073126
Because we live in a culture which practices slave morality, and women's power comes from their ability to prove they are the oppressed gender class. Why do you think minorities are so eager to prove how supposedly weak and oppressed they are, much of the time it's simply a means to power, not a genuine argument in 2023.

That's more a critic of capitalism than matriarchy. 100-200 years ago many Americans were working 12 hour shifts in sweatshops, both the men and women.

>"It is quite incredible that men, whose desire for knowledge is unbounded in every other field, are really totally blind to these facts, that they are incapable of seeing women as they really are: with nothing else to offer but a vagina, two breasts,...."
She spits pure venom all throughout this book. She hates em

And she was pro NEET too. Every robot should read her book.

This mindset is a product of the industrial revolution. Almost all technology has been just ways to relieve the work women do (washing clothes, doing dishes, etc) so women became losers who do no real work and men became expected to provide for them. Before the industrial revolution, women and men both suffered and labored. Men didn't used to be the slaves of women.

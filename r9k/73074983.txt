Feeling sad in understandable but making yourself sad with mudic is just foolish

How you actually going out every weekend night to meet women? I notice a lot of dudes anrent actively pursuing women. When I get a car I plan on going to malls and nightclubs to meet women

It just amplify the sadness, if i feel like i didn't cry like since months i'll take one night to cry myself to sleep while listening to sad songs. I usually bottle up everything, but at the same time i don't want to blow up randomly and hurt peoples feelings with my shit, at least in my bed it's safe
>>73074998
I go out, i'm just not approachable at all, whenever i go out alone i end up daydreaming and not focusing on the outside world, i have also a resting bitch face that make me look always pissed off, i stopped looking at people in the face because i don't want to piss/scare anyone off. Not ugly tho

>peak of satisfaction
Was experiencing peak misery at that age lmao

Nothing changed because you never changed. Shocker.
--- 73075083
>>73075040
I want do share my life with someone else, not just getting laid
>>73075059
I changed, i'm losing hair lmao, but not joking i actually changed a fuckton, civil service helped me a lot with development, i'm still a virgin but i atleast lost my asshole behaviour

Same with the laid plus connection. Sexual compatibility is a must, without it, you get sexless marriage
--- 73075093
>>73075086
>you get sexless marriage
Wouldn't mind it if i get married with an (really) asexual girl

You say that now, but years later your mind will change. Also sex is very important for long term relationships

I knew it was over when I was 16. I realized I was different in 4th grade. Shit is fucked, but oh well.

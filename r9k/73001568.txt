femboys and most gays in general are extremely toxic and catty to people, as well as severely narcissistic and mentally ill. genuinely horrible people to be around.

They are if they take HRT.
>have to clean out their intestines whenever you want to top them

Not the ones you'll find here, typically.
>no shared biological children
You planned on reproducing? Here? On this earth?

Once again, HRT solves this.

Find an HRT femboy. The only downside is the mental illness but it's still more manageable than dealing with a woman.

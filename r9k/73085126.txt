28 year old here. I've been trying to get out of the house and make friends for years now. I tried during the daytime and couldn't find anyone, so then I started trying at night after work (especially on weekends) and still couldn't find anyone. I try to reconnect with old schoolmates via Facebook (the ones who haven't moved anyway) and still nothing. I try to strike up conversations with strangers, and it's always super brief, like they're in a hurry to end the conversation and get back to doing nothing.

Am I missing something? Do people just not want to socialize anymore?

Try facebook groups? Find something that interests you like cars, guns, politics? Offer to take your coworkers to a bar your treat?

Majority of my coworkers are older women, and I'm usually the only male employee during my shift. At most there's one other because the schedule maker is fucking retarded and thinks one-two guys is enough to do all the physical labor while the women run the registers.

A lot don't. Honestly I don't want to meet new people so much now that I established a group. Took like 4 months of intense networking

The key is repeat exposure a lot of the time. You're in a place and see the same people over and over

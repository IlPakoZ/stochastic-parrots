Whats the point of forcing transgendershit into literally everything these days?

Unironically, before people started randomly claiming that x character is trans or y thing is trans and started shoving their flag into everything I just viewed trannies as mostly normal people and had no problems with them.
But now that they do that, I have a negative view of them and generally dislike them. What is the point of this? They literally make themselves look bad because "muh representatiun" which seems pretty counterproductive imo.

Legbuttism is a subculture like furries and such but they have strong support from governments and corporations. It's a cash cow with a lot of security.

These communities kind of encourage this sort of narcissistic behaviour, because maybe when you are in outsider group it can become an obsessive identity - maybe as sort of coping mechanism. Remember when gays said you had to be gay to be artistic and creative? Or when they used to say that their sexuality made them inherently interesting people? Its that sort of thing, but its the transsexuals doing it. They became transexual missionaries, going to the point to claiming that if you like a certain (male) hobby that you MUST be transexual.

There are a lot of sexual predators doing this purely because it gives them a hard on, this is usually seen in repressed homos, tranny chasers, fucked up in the head bpd biological women, perverted trannies etc. You can see it in the transmaxxing threads, inevitably any transmaxxer is going to kill themselves because you are cis heterosexual man forcing yourself in a womanly body and identity, or its going to fuck with your head so much that go fully ultra homo for dicks. Autistic men are particularly the target for this predatory fetishising, because autistic men are vulnerable. Autistic men are the big for bpd women, because these women like the idea of taking advantage of a vulnerable man (the dominant gender) and perverting/distorting their innocence to turn them into a perversion of themselves, so any autistic man here should beware dating these women - bpd women hate autistic males. Theyll list traits common in the life of autistic males (not fitting in, feeling excluded), and list them as transexual traits so that they can have autistic men to lose their confidence, this purely out of sexual perversion

Here is one example of a sexual pervert, I do have friends who are transexual and they are respectable people, I doubt that this particular person is even a transexual. More like a homosexual male or a BPD woman

Cis male here, its because the internet is cancer and breeds the worse out of any niche and tightly group. Any group of subset of people are going to become a cult, geek culture is this but worse, geek culture is made out of the absolute horrific dregs of any group of people

It is purely out of narcissism, although shouldn't be a surprise since most "trans" people are actual narcissist

To push you out, idiot. Tranny mod team goes in, original fan/userbase gets kicked out. Pretty normal - they see you occupying a spot, so they decide it's time to fix that.

LGBT is a cult, and everything that doesn't explicitly support it is against it. Having homos isn't enough, it needs trannies as well.

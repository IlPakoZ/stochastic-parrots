How has 4chan helped you out in real life? All the insults have made me numb to words
--- 73187080
I've been here since 2009 and the only thing that has helped me is to kek to some anons.

otherwise, it's a fucking shithole, specially this board.

What makes you keep coming back? I came here around 2011, always check in monthly or multiple times if im free that day , im addicted

Why would it have? I guess I discovered more shit to consume. Also insults on the internet are hardly the same as real life. I'm still a neurotic cuntface.

/x/ gave me a huge e-library and thanks to that board i know how to lucid dream and had some experiences in the astral

Link to the elibrary?

 All the gore and human wickedness made me numb to, well, that. And the constant flow of straight up autistic arguments and behaviour made it impossible for me to get startled or affected by any behavior a normie can manage to conjure. I'd say overall 4chan builds up resilience to humankind.

ill guess its either the /omg/ library or the astral projection one

I was actually going to kill myself in two weeks but seeing someone say I should today makes me so angry I am not going to, just out of spite.

Browsing 4chan helped me discover how much easier women have it early so i could start my transition while still young and pass better than if i discovered the truth at like 40 or something and looked like those pol memes.

I have got aspergers and all the people here calling me a retard has made me desensitized to it from anyone IRL

Porn addiction and later descent into NTR has taught me to never trust a woman.

thicker skin, quicker wits, better grammar and most importantly giving me the truth about what is cringe. /fa/ sticky and cringe threads on /b/ probably saved me from becoming some trench coat wearing katana dude during my teens.
--- 73187987
Made me robust against gore, trolling, bullying that sort of thing.
More schizo about conspiracies.
--- 73188010
>>73187974
I mean I'm basically that dude but I sort of don't care about talking to humans anymore, like I'm too depressed to try and talk to women to get to know them so I could score some pussy, the effort for that just isn't worth it

between ages 15-25 you really should conform despite what everyone say, those are probably the most important years of your life for people who don't socialize easily. 
but late 20s onwards you can actually fill your house with armor suits, halberds and swords and people wont really give a shit anymore. its still a little weird but conformity stops being the golden rule.
--- 73188190
>>73188126
Those years are important but with my asocial personality and the fact that I will never find a woman I could tolerate and also the fact that I kind of don't want to reproduce so my kids wouldn't have aspergers or worse autism
I don't think wearing normal clothes instead of cool jackets and having short hair and stuff will save me, I mean I'm getting more muscular so maybe that will be impressive to normies 
Like I want to fuck but at the same time if I will be a useless neet then maybe I shouldn't I think? Also over the years I stopped being attracted to 3d girls because they don't even look good not even mentioning their boring personalities and their "I just want to fit in" lifestyles

These. Also lurking /g/ as a teenager got me into programming and eventually a job.

>I stopped being attracted to 3d girls because they don't even look good not even mentioning their boring personalities and their "I just want to fit in" lifestyles
same. nothing turns me off more than realizing that someone have no free will or curiosity about anything other than what they are ''supposed to''. 
its just so ridiculous to me a basement dweller to tell others to have a little depth.

Some Anon's knowledge on piss bottles and how big of a bottle a man needs to use was extremely helpful when I had to use a piss bottle
Thank you that Anon from many years ago

>Also lurking /g/ as a teenager got me into programming and eventually a job.
Damn, me too. I used to post code and work on stuff in dpts back in the day. One day saw a thread talking about coding bootcamps and decided to quit college to go to one. The job hunt was horrible afterwards but eventually I got a job and moved out from it. It's dumb but I'll never forget that /g/ helped me when I was most depressed and aimless in my life. sharethreads on /mu/ got me into a lot of music that changed my life too, though in a less material way than /g/ to be fair. 
Aside from that, 4chan helped me feel less lonely, at least the smaller boards. To this day I still don't have any real friends. But I feel like in general this website is less friendly now so it doesn't really fill that role anymore.
--- 73188664
I've met some really nice people from this board and I'm hoping to meet some more nice people I can be friends with/fall in love with. Something tells me that all the nice people I met early on into my /r9k/ career was a rare stroke of luck, though. I've barely met anyone I really like recently.

Dang, now that you point that out, it does seem kind of retarded to be looking for friends in this dumpster of a website. I don't regret meeting the interesting people I've met here, though. Except for maybe one person.

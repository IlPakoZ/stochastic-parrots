Do you date men OP?
--- 73179361
Ok??? So the only thing that makes a man a man is having a penis then? So if someone chopped off your dick would that make you a woman all of a sudden?

How the fuck am I not a man when I LITERALLY:

Wear mens clothing
NEVER WEAR PINK OR DRESSES
Into sports
Like getting dirty
Never paint my nails
Hold the door open for women
Eat a diet of red meat and beer
Drive a truck
Attend a church
AND I workout pretty much every day. Sometimes even twice a day.

>>73179311
I date men yeah, but you'd be gay for dating a fellow dude Anon. I'm NOT girly at all. Literally as male as I can possibly be.

You will never have a Y chromosome.
--- 73179432
>>73179258 (OP)
You will never be a real man. You have a womb. You have no prostate. Your height and broad hips give you away.
>>73179361
I do every single thing you mentioned and I'm a woman, your hobbies don't determine your sex. Biology does. Seek help before it's too late.

I'm also FTM. Don't bother trying to get validation from men here. Most of them are closet homo faggots anyways that dress up like women.

>>73179405
Fuck yourself. You reek of micropenis energy.
--- 73179458

As opposed to no penis?

And yet here you are fishing for male attention
--- 73179474
>>73179448
You will never have a penis.
You will never have a Y chromosome.
Your skeleton is female.
Your hips are female.
You have ovaries, a womb, and a clit.

You will never be a man. Your female name will be listed on our grave stone.

Seethe harder, tranny. Hahahaha

NTA but what a womanly comment. Only faggots and women go for dicksize jokes. I do agree you shouldn't get validation here though, this place is a crab bucket.

--- 73179645
>>73179361
You are just an exaggerated parody of what you think a man is supposed to be or act like
You are no different than a man who pretends to be a woman and does exaggerated things that he deems feminine or a racist putting on black face and "acting black" 
See ya
--- 73179646

Enlarged clit.

Why would you want a vagina? We bleed every month.
--- 73179675
>>73179361
>Wear mens clothing
>NEVER WEAR PINK OR DRESSES
Okay, so good so far.
>Into sports
Women can like sports too and there are women's sports for a reason. Not all men like sports either. Do you enjoy being competitive and the teamwork aspect or are you just doing it because it's fun to run around?
>Like getting dirty
That's not a manly thing, that's a slob thing.
>Never paint my nails
Feels like you're grasping at straws.
>Hold the door open for women
This is a cultural thing but more so it's about being nice.
>Eat a diet of red meat and beer
Does beer and red meat make you manly..? Red meat is just good and beer is cheap liquor, which is why people drink it(and its an acquired taste for many too).
>Drive a truck
So does my sister.
>Attend a church
More women tend to attend churches than men.
>AND I workout pretty much every day. Sometimes even twice a day.
Being fit is manly..? Are you weightlifting or just doing cardio anyhow?
--- 73179688

Hey anon, men can be short and have broad hips too, be sensitive to our fellow male anons. I should know, I have broad hips.

>>73179448
>You reek of micropenis energy.
Some friendly advice: next time, call them a faggot, that's a much more masculine insult. Your current choice of insult reeks of woman.
--- 73179713

Not very manly.

No you don't, female puberty is extremely traumatizing also rape
--- 73179839
>>73179758
Ironically, a tomboy I know once said she would love to do this, but instead of killing someone it was to punch through a mountain on one of those barren alien planets they're always fighting on.
--- 73179842
>>73179832
Guys get raped too you ass wipe.
--- 73179856
>>73179361
There was that other ftm that thought I was a dumbass because I assumed her thought process was the same. I hope you're reading this because now I feel vindicated - most ftms are this stupid and think that doing big manly man things like cracking a cold beer open with the boys hah is what defines being a man.
--- 73179857

how so
--- 73179860

Yawn. Of course. Point still stands

Yeah but not as often, bonehead.
--- 73179887
>>73179857
When I got my first period I thought I was dying, was extremely uncomfortable when my tits started to grow and the attention it caused. Everyone starts treating you differently.
--- 73179892
>>73179862
I take it you don't know what male prisons are then. Rape happens there more then your bullshit 1/5 statistic. No sweatie, 20% of men aren't rapist's waiting around every corner for you. 
If the first world is so dangerous to you go live in Africa.
--- 73179909

nta but did you get raped?
--- 73179932
>>73179361

100% larp confirmed, the only reason any women transitions is to fuck straight women. There literally is no reason beyond that.
--- 73179939
>>73179887
>When I got my first period I thought I was dying
what age? both male and female puberty is a subject were taught about in 5th class biology here
>was extremely uncomfortable when my tits started to grow
fair, though i dont see why that would be traumatizing
--- 73179941
>>73179909
Yes and I'm sick of pampered bitches crying about something that hasn't happened to them as if they're on a knifes edge away from being assaulted the second they step outside. Bitches need to shut the fuck up.
--- 73179949
>>73179932
There's a lot of FTM fujoshis.
--- 73179950
>>73179738
Idk what to do with it either. I have relatively small shoulders too, so I'd probably look ridiculous if I got buff.
Also, my hips are actually wider than >>73179701's, at least relative to the size of my waist. So that's a thing.

>>73179887
When I got my first erection, I felt the same, so it's not that special.
--- 73179954
>>73179887
>traumatized by a little bit of blood
God you're so far removed from what a man is. I can't tell you how many times I've been to the hospital for getting horrible ill as a kid and I've been rushed to the ER before for a severe concussion that I lost consciousness to. Boys bleed all the time from getting hurt while they're outside fucking around as a kid, take painful falls, etc.. You have live one cushioned life if some period blood really made you feel like you were going to die and people paying attention to you traumatized you.

> i dont see why that would be traumatizing
I'm autistic so I don't like change, female family members would always comment on my body changing and males started to treat me differently, it felt uncomfortable.
--- 73179998
Trannies of r9k, why do you do this? You already know what the responses are going to look like, is it a misgendering fetish? I understand because i'm a bio woman with a huge misogyny and rape fetish, but if it isn't, you are seriously ill.

>>73179758
I do this. I'd listen to rock or other high energy songs and imagine creating DBZ type energy blasts, or imagine my favorite character doing that. Creating combos in the air, punching them down and the impact creates a crater in the ground. FtMs are just pathetic fujoshi, but we all knew this.
>>73179887
Lmao. When I got my first period I just said "ok cool" because I was properly educated. Nobody treated me differently. I was never the victim of rape or terrible sexism. Periods ache and feel disgusting but they're just part of life. 
Why are some girls' victim complexes so insane they rival the worst of this board? Are you incapable of realizing maybe some of your problems were caused by yourself, instead of just the fact that you're a woman?
Ywnbam btw

My apologies then. Still quite a cushy life.

i still wish i were a girl biologically idk
--- 73180049

I'm not the troon and when I got my period for the first time there was a lot of it. It freaked me out because I wasn't taught about it until later in the year.

The real play is to accept that you're a woman and try to make the best life you can and not live in a delusion that your life would suddenly be better if something impossible happened.

Also you are a nigger.
--- 73181315
>>73181122
Why should I just accept my life as a woman?? I'm not even feminine. I was bullied by other women growing up. The other girls always said I look like a man anyways. The way I always dressed in shorts and wore my hair short. 

The only people that were ever nice to me were men. I thought surely they could understand. That I'm like them.

But no, no one accepts me. Not even you people. I can't just wear pink and put on dresses. That's not who I am! Why the fuck are you trying to force me to be that?? I just want to be cool like one of the guys!

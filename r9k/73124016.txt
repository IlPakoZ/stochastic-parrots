Stacey actually has a fairly difficult life. Incels assume beautiful women live on easy mode, but I know one (did modelling as a side job) and that's what she tells me

>when she won a science contest in university, everyone assumed its because she slept with the professor. she obviously didnt
>constant catcalling and harassment, even from married middle aged men whose daughter she could be
>everyone assumes her Korean bf only likes her for her pretty blonde white girl looks with Koreans simp over, when they actually connected over a passion for cooking international cuisine

Basically, everyone only sees you as sex tool and breeding stock and ignores all other aspects of you
--- 73124023
Ok but how do they treat her as a result of that? Pretty fucking well I'd imagine
--- 73124031
>>73124023
>getting punched in the face randomly is "pretty fucking well"
--- 73124032
>>73124016 (OP)
Oh wow trully that makes it fair between you and us now
--- 73124035
What do you expect me to do about it? I could maybe breed her. I get the impression that's not where you want to go with this though.
--- 73124036
>just because she didn't sleep with him doesn't mean she didn't win because of her looks and/or being a woman
>Boohoo people find you attractive
>That was probably an excuse he made up to talk to her because he found her attractive. First came being attracted to her, then came feigning interest in her to get in her pants (and by extension if you aren't attractive no one will want to know anything about you).
--- 73124038
>>73124032
Not fair.
Men live life on easy mode.
Sorry chud but its the truth.
Hot women are the real victims.
--- 73124041
>>73124031
OP never said anything about being punched in the face.
--- 73124047
>>73124016 (OP)
These are literally all first-world problems. You know her life is easy because these are the things she choose to complain about.
--- 73124055
>>73124031
What attractive women are getting punched in the face? If an attractive woman faces ANY violence in her life it is almost surely from being an immature child and picking an abusive boyfriend. In which case she'll find no sympathy from anyone on this board. Simply choose better men it is that simple.
--- 73124057
>>73124041
If she's a real Stacey then you already know she gets abused through no fault of her own.
--- 73124058
>>73124016 (OP)
>random strangers say mean things about me
i remember 15 years ago on 9gag we used to make fun of first world problems, now they're fucking tragedies, should we pay women reparations for those too?
--- 73124083
>>73124057
Yes, this is the halo effect in action. When an incel suffers, it's ignored by society. When stacy gets inconvenienced, people consider it a tragedy.

It's funny how you are proving OP wrong.
--- 73124089
>>73124055
>just bee yourself
>no not like that!
great advice, bitch made. better men don't need to choose violence.
--- 73124098
>>73124083
>When an incel suffers, it's ignored by society
Cuckold, have you never been on 4chan.org before? Are you seriously this stupid? All you hear on most places on the internet is how Andrew Tate is going to save all the incels.
--- 73124099
>>73124016 (OP)
Nope easy mode. Modelling is hard? Find another job. It was already common it does NOT pay well at all
--- 73124125
>>73124098
Andrew Tate and 4chan are shunned by society. Fail.
--- 73124141
>>73124125
>incels are so fucking retarded that they will claim to be shunned by society but also claim to represent 60-80% of men
Go.....LE FUCK YOURSELF! you are the reason Stacy gets abused btw
--- 73124153
>>73124141
I never claimed that, schizo. Take your meds.
--- 73124161
>>73124089
Yeah, better men aren't choosing violence but those men aren't being chosen by women because women are children now days.
--- 73124162
>>73124153
What % of men are sexless, boss?
--- 73124163
>>73124055
>What attractive women are getting punched in the face?
burn the coal pay the toll
You know exactly which types are getting punched.
--- 73124167
>>73124161
>better men aren't being chosen by women
that's because they are much worse and more violent. it's rare to find a good man since they are all taken.
--- 73124192
her korean bf probably deep down knows he just bagged a 10 out of 10. we are all men here. we know physical attraction even if we enjoy common interests

also. i would love to be a hot ass woman and have all my issues revolve around having too much attention where i can get any guy or simp or favor or money if i wanted. wow so harddd
--- 73124194
>>73124162
It's pretty hilarious how obsessed you are with incels.
--- 73124203
>>73124194
I humbly accept your concession, bud.
--- 73124222
>>73124203
That wasn't me, retard.

The number from sources I've read is nowhere close to 60% like you misquoted.
--- 73124233
>>73124222
Most sources say 80% of men are incels. How are they possibly "shunned" by sucksiety, weirdo? They literally control seetheciety
--- 73124244
>>73124141
Daily reminder: 60% of american men age between 18 and 29 claim to be single while 60% of their females counterparts claim not to be
--- 73124262
>>73124244
And this is a good thing. Most men just aren't capable of having a relationship. Society always talks about incels but generally ignores abuse when it's a woman.
--- 73124266
>>73124244
The funniest thing about that statistic is whenever anyone is talking about it they always say "30% of adults are single" and suspiciously leave out the 63% of young men. Even when men are suffering, feminists will twist the data to support themselves.
--- 73124277
>>73124266
They aren't suffering if they chose to be single though.
--- 73124278
>>73124262
Guys will get and abuse of 18-29 pussy when they turn 30+ and you will just hit the wall.
--- 73124300
>>73124278
Men literally and unironically have life on easy mode, yes.
--- 73124310
>>73124300
It's the women that are deliberately choosing to date older guys. "Empowerment" means nothing with sugar daddy's wallet.
--- 73124315
>>73124310
Without* originally
--- 73124318
>>73124310
>women
>choosing
lol. lmao even. we both know how men force women into relationships.
--- 73124320
>>73124016 (OP)
>tfw the halo effect made you believe all of that
Stacy wins again
--- 73124324
>>73124318
No we don't. How do men force women into relationships, today, in the western world, in 2023?
--- 73124332
>>73124300
>LE GENDER PAY GAP YOU GUYS!!!!!
--- 73124334
>>73124324
The same way as always. Even 60 year old incels are using and abusing young 18 year old girls.
--- 73124342
>>73124334
Tell me, anon. I'm really dying to know. How do I force a woman to be in a relationship with me?
--- 73124363
>>73124300
>Men literally and unironically have life on easy mode
you mean chad
>>73124278
>Guys will get and abuse of 18-29 pussy when they turn 30+
most guys doing that are around their age, and they are the top 5% doing that, aka chad or tyrone
>you will just hit the wall
lol the wall doesnt exist. its a cope delusion in MGTOW redpill morons
--- 73124371
>>73124016 (OP)
Hum, I wonder how Stacy can solve that? Maybe she could stop trying so hard to be so beautiful? Like, just eating what she wants, don't spend 2 hours doing her hair and makeup. All the hot girls I've met spent a good chunk of their lives by trying to be how they were, hot girls can just stop if it's a problem. The fact that they don't makes me think they don't have it that bad.
--- 73124375
>>73124342
Learn to shower and grow some balls. If you're still a pickme waiting to be "chosen" and you're older than 14 years old, you deserve to be alone based and redpilled.

this thread reads like shitty bait with korean propaganda

>the korean shitposters have gotten more clever and a bit more subtle with their bait
i approve
--- 73124388
>>73124375
That still doesn't explain me how I can coerce a woman into being in a relationship with me against her will.
--- 73124398
>>73124388
It honestly does. Showers help a lot.
--- 73124412
>>73124300
living for ourselves is easy mode and you foids can't do the same thing? this is fucking pathetic on your side
--- 73124418
>>73124412
>easy mode
Yes, correct
>can't do the same thing
Also correct
>pathetic
Not our fault.
--- 73124445
>>73124388
What this "femanon" is tip toeing around is that women will enter a relationship with someone they have absolutely no sexual/personal interest towards in order to get access to their resources. Several famous examples of this including Anna Nicole Smith (r.i.p).
--- 73124449
>>73124418
Just go outside sis and socialize with others sis it's not that hard. don't forget to take a shower. that's the only way to easy mode
--- 73124451
>>73124449
>just go outside
ok.

>>when she won a science contest in university
she wouldn't have won if she was ugly.
>>everyone assumes her Korean bf only likes her for her pretty blonde white girl looks
he would have never spoken to her if she was ugly.
>>constant catcalling and harassment
maybe she should stop dressing like a whore/living in a nigger neighbourhood
--- 73124861
>>73124016 (OP)
what i lacked was a passion for cooking international cuisine

don't worry fembot, someone will love you for who you are

Absolutely fucking not.
Those worthless cretins make up maybe 10% at most.

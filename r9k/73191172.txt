what things surprised you about other people's homes and their relationships with their families?

I flat-out don't like hearing about other people's facilities because they are almost always larger and more tightknit than mine. Even worse if they have money.

because it seems unattainable? makes yours seem less, or the reality unignorable?

Some people just straight up do not clean, ever.

At my friend Max's house they didn't have any sour cream for the tacos. At Cullen's house they bowed their heads and said grace before dinner. No one was allowed in Kyle's house, I would go help with washing the dishes after school so we could go ride bikes and one day his dad walked in the back door and it seemed pretty bad. I heard he flipped the whole dinner table over one night when he didn't like the meal (tacos).

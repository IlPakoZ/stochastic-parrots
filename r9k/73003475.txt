Don't waste your life in this shithole, you know you can do way more with your life

I don't have all the answers nor I'm particularly smart but I do know your life has value so don't let yourself be ruled by hate, rise above it and try to live a life you're proud of

It's not going to be easy but it will be worth it. There's good people on this site but it's a very negative enviorment that corrupts your soul

Leave and live

God bless
--- 73003694
> God bless
Look around this shithole and tell me theres a god.
--- 73003749
>>73003694
We brought this upon ourselves though, we need to accept responsability for our own actions and deliberately choose to be better

I'm certain that God exists, and seeing this site is further proof of how much we need Him in our lives

whats worth? Be a double time sucker, carrying nothing but shame, constant defeat, pain, struggle and fear? Fuck that shit. I may have never won, but neither did I lose. I prefer to stay the way I m. 
There is nothing more disappointing that letting hope run through your veins. Nothing but venom.
Just stay indoors and do whatever the fuck you want.
No point in going outside unless you are a normalfag

>Don't waste your life in this shithole, you know you can do way more with your life
I know, but I'm so tired. I'm with depression, and just recently I got lab results that show that I have leukemia. So my countdown is ticking. I pushed the doctor a bit for honest informations, and he said "could be 5 years, could be longer".
>your life has value so don't let yourself be ruled by hate
I'm not a hater. I don't even hate the guys who raped me when I was a teen. I also don't hate the incels here who say that women enjoy rape. I just see no point in hate.
>try to live a life you're proud of
That's more easyly said than done.
>There's good people on this site
I think many are ok, just bitter and lonely.
>but it's a very negative enviorment that corrupts your soul
That's the same for nearly all society now. In a world where the governments doing a psywar against the people, you can't expect much sanity. Here the people are honest at least.
>Leave and live
Life is a movie. And this board is the last row where others don't want to sit. That's ok.
>God bless
Thanks.

You should not give up, trying and failing is better than not trying at all, at least it gives you a sense of purpuse

You need to find something that will make the suffering of this life worth it, a purpuse

Do not fall into the nihilism and hedonism trap, it might work for a while but reality will catch up to you, you are not a defenseless victim, you have a choice

>trying and failing is better than not trying at all, at least it gives you a sense of purpuse
Yeah, eating a bullet.
>You need to find something that will make the suffering of this life worth it, a purpuse
Fuck you.
>Do not fall into the nihilism and hedonism trap, it might work for a while but reality will catch up to you, you are not a defenseless victim, you have a choice
Its not a trap, its the truth. You make the purpose out of this stupid nonsense called life. But it has none. Its just whatever BS you make up in your mind.
The day will come where I end myself or die from natural causes, and I m not suffering until then from slavery (work/studying), hope, people and whatever other BS normalcunts like you enjoy.
--- 73003913
>>73003826
I'm very sorry about your results, it must have been heartbreaking. I will not dare to tell you what do to do with your time but try to make the most of it, you never know doctors give diagnosis based on previous cases so they don't really know for sure

Try to avoid falling into nihilism which this site promotes, and look within yourself what do you want to do with your life, it's not really about how long it is but how you use it

Again I'm sorry about your situation and at the end of the day I'm just some dumb guy on the internet but I know your life is valuable and meaningful and I want you to know that too
--- 73003941
>>73003884
You seem pretty confident about your position so it's very hard to convince you otherwise but if you got so defensive maybe it's because deep down you know you're lying to yourself

No one knows if life has meaning, not even yourself so don't jump to conclusions
--- 73004053
>>73003913
Thanks :)
I think my life has meaning so far, because I learned a lot about this crazy world, and that's basicly the purpose of it. And to leave it doesn't scare me. There are some things I would like to try, like having a love relationship, and maybe travel to Japan, but if not then also no drama.
--- 73004096
>>73003475 (OP)
Im miserable and dumb when I dont use this site. Im miserable and dumb when I do use it, plus I have people to talk to.
--- 73004116
>>73004053
I think this crazy world is part of it's purpuse, I like the philosophy of absuridm and it explains it quite well, however I do believe in God and I think our purpose is to rise above hate and suffering and show kindness like Jesus did

And of course, I mean it's worth a shot, you could first try to go to Japan for some time and maybe become and english teacher? There are programs that can help you out

And who knows maybe during your time there you end up in a relationship, I think you should try it and let leaves fall where they may, because it would be an adventure regardless of the outcome so it's worth it
--- 73004145

What gives you life meaning?
--- 73004164
>>73003475 (OP)
I appreciate it, but I can't do much of about the negativity. I'm not ruled by hate, I am hate. I've spent most of my life trying to cover it up to appear normal, to little avail.
Good thread, though.
--- 73004171
>>73004145
Good question, I think I'm trying to be the person I wanted my father to be, so I try to think of ways my current self could've helped my older self

So I'm trying to help others to the best of my ability. Also I want to live a simple quiet life because my life had a lot of drama and all growing up
--- 73004199
>>73004164
I used to cover my hate until I couldn't hide it anymore, that's when I realized I hated people because to me they were evil

Then I realized that I'm just as bad so I couldn't really judge, plus I believe we all share the same nature at the end of the day and we are all fuck ups who need each other so we need to be kinder because we are all trying
--- 73004238

>I want to live a simple quiet life because my life had a lot of drama and all growing up
I can relate to that.
>I'm trying to help others to the best of my ability
And to that too.
So far I can do it only here. But better than nothing. Someone has to be the oposition to all the hate here.
--- 73004265
>>73004245
Totally, we don't have to do anything grandiose, we just need to do our part

I'm trying to help others here a bit, maybe I will try to make some philosophy videos on YouTube in my native language so I can reach them too and then irl stuff such as volunteering or so
--- 73004294
I have a learning difficulty and find this is the only place where I feel welcome and its funny to sometimes I have good chats with people or like the memes 
but it does also make me sad and spend too long here 
I dont think I can quit
--- 73004310
>>73004265
I take it a bit as my job here to get into discussions with incels (even if it annoys me often) to give them some insight into the female perspective. Usually useless, but maybe not always. The only way to end the gender-war is to talk to each other.
--- 73004559
>>73004294
You can try to limit your time here by engaging in fulfilling hobbies, you might end up meeting cool people too so it's a win/win
--- 73004574
>>73004310
Yeah I also see it as my duty, it's great that you're doing your part on using your experience to help others grows, it's not an easy thing

I used to be quite a degenerate so I need to use this site the least as possible but from time to time I will try to post similar threads, it could help someone out
--- 73004631
>>73004559
I think your right that is a good idea
I will have a look at doing some hobbies like archery maybe because I used to like that a lot
--- 73004824
>>73004631
Oh yes, that's pretty badass

You should do it, that will boost your confidence too, please give it a shot again anon
--- 73004947
>>73004824
I am so tired of being bored and sad that I will definitely do this. It beats staring at a wall anyway.
--- 73005017
>>73004947
That's absolutely right, I'm trying to do a similar thing with my own passions, baby steps but always keep moving forward
--- 73005075

all the best to you on your journey friend

--- 73005202
>>73004574
I was quite normal, from my perspective, but the world has just gone crazy with the woke culture-war. I can't pretend to accept that, so I would get kicked out nearly all social media. Only here is a last resort for free speech, so I'm here.
--- 73005251
>>73005149
Thank you anon, I really appreciate the support.
--- 73005313
>>73005202
I mean if you use it as a means to an end then it's good, just make sure you take care of yourself first and foremost because it's pretty easy to let the negativity get you

In my case I grew up very isolated so I developed some weird fetishes, nothing too crazy but it's weird for normal people's standards but pretty tame for people here, but even if it's the case I want to leave because I want to avoid falling back into it

So I guess making some threads every couple of months could be a good middle ground, an ''in an out'' endeavor
--- 73005463
>>73005313
I find it interesting to talk to incels, because it's a challenge. First to not get angry and insult them when they call me slut, whore, retard etc (it's really a good training in patience), and also it helped to develope my view on society. I could easily have fallen into the feminist trap, as it's everywhere in society now and even rewarded as a virtue. That's why I'm not at crystal cafe and joining in to their filter-bubble of all-men-bad. It would be easy to do that, but the easy way is often not the good one. And cc is a really toxic place, more than here, because they have the whole support of cultural marxism behind their ideology, and that is a force of literal evil. Hearing feminists for years actually brought me on the edge to become a misogynist myself :) ... but I'm with the light, and don't need to hate anyone, not the scrotes and not the roasties.
--- 73005546
>>73005463
Exactly, my mom was emotionally abusive so I was a bit of a mysognistic at some point and then I realized that men sucked to so I became a misanthrope then I realized that I'm human too and therefore I'm no better than them so I became more humble and with a humbler perspective

It's like that Goethe quote ''There's no crime in the world I don't deem myself capable of commiting''

Once you realize this it's easier to put yourself in someone else's shoes, however it's hard at times but it's the right thing to do, it takes strenght to be kind since anyone can be hateful
--- 73005707
>>73005546
I remeber a similar quote from Hamlet. (Ich hab den Faust I mal gelesen, aber ist schon laenger her.)
Sounds like and interesting journey trough the realms of hate. In my teenage I got into the darkness once, but directed it against myself and tried suicide. The drama that I caused with that was a good wake-up-call. We are not alone in the world and our actions affect others. I find it sad how quickly people here reply with "kys".No one should ever say that. But we have to talk the people as they are, I guess.
--- 73005837
>>73005707
I'm actually trying to learn german but nope I didn't understand that quote without putting it into the translator hahaha

Darkness can be overwhelming, I don't believe anyone wants to die, they just want their pain to end but if they could live a completely different life they'd do it, at least that's what I believe, I'm glad you didn't kill yourself, you seem like a great person

In my case I had violent urges towards people growing up, then porn addiction as a way to cope, then I became a shell of a person and now I'm in my current journey of trying to help people like me, I'm kinda worried because I don't know if I'll ever function normally sexually due to all the weird porn I watched but I can't really be mad, I brought it upon myself but I hope I get better with time
--- 73006019
>>73005837
All I know about sex so far was violence, so I didn't have the best starting point too. But I believe that sex with love is completely different from sex for lust or fetish or power. I have no proof, but I'm quite sure that an intimate relationship could whipe away all the dirt in the mind. As it's said, an aeon of darkness can be finished with one flash of light. The dark and ugly has less power than people think. Thats a kind of psyop of the demons, to make people believe that the abyss is so deep that there is no hope for salvation, but the salvation is finally like waking up from a nightmare, and that is, in theory, possible any time.
>you seem like a great person
Thanks :)
--- 73006074
>>73006019
That actually inspired me, thank you. I think my fetish came because a mix of isolation and due to how abusive was my mom emotionally, plus my dad was a drunk so I was afraid of him so maybe Freud was up to something with his oedipus complex theory because at 10 years old I found hentai and with it I found straight shota (I was a kid at the time so I self-inserted) and most of it was incest-themed so I developed a mom fetish let's say

The best route to take is to commit to the christian life and avoid porn, masturbation and all and forgive my mom for her short comings

I'm very sorry that you had to go through that abuse but it's great that you know that sex with love is a whole different thing, sexual abuse is some terrible and vile thing which focuses on destroying the person's will, it's the opposite of love
--- 73006254
>>73006074
Sounds like a really bad family story, I'm sorry to hear that. Fetishes are kind of strange to me, but as long as it is not about children and rape (or doing things with death bodies, eeew) I don't care. To stay away completely from porn might be really difficult for boys when they're frustrated and lonely for long time. And with depression it's really not easy to be disciplined. Like I drink too much wine, what is bad in my medical condition, but I can't stop it. It cheers me up. So I don't judge others vices.
The abuse I experienced was not about destroying my will, I would say. These guys were just hard bad-boys who don't care much, and I was nearly passed out on drugs. Maybe they didn't even considered it to be a serious crime. Could be that it was really just casual fun for them. A lesson about men's darkest sides. But I think that these kind of sociopathic chad-types are the sexual predators, and not the incels. Incels talk edgy about rape often, but I think it's very rare that they would really do it.
--- 73006321
>>73006254
Yeah, there are worse upbringings but mine was certainly worse than average, it's bad because it doesn't stop at home, if you see that in your house then you think it's acceptable when people treat you like scum, which I accepted for a long time, thankfully I see the bigger picture now

Yeah I don't mind fetishes that much but when it comes to my fetishes... like yeah I self-inserted as the shota and I wasn't into the kid just the grown woman but I feel very guilty, I have constant intrusive thoughts about ''am I a pedo?'' even though I have 0 attraction to kids of either gender

And sadly I know a few girls with similar experiences, one of them was being held while some guys fingered her and it scarred her pretty bad mentally, you're right about the chad-types, most of them since they can get away with a lot of things start to view people as a means to an end

When I was young I was a kind of alternative liberal, or what I thought that is, and that was basically drugs and music and emo-style clothes. At that time I saw religious traditions as square and boring. But when I got out of the dark in my mind, and became an adult, I realised that people need religious traditions to stay sane in this world. It's the atheists who are going crazy, with materialism and marxism and wokeness. And the evil forces in this world, who are pushing the culture war, trying to get religion into it, to mix it with politics. In the west they're pushing conflicts between christians and muslims, in the east between hindus, buddhists and muslims, and the goal is to spoil religion for everyone. Let's hope that there are enough reasonable religious people in the world to resist that and share their spiritual vision of a peaceful world without all the mass promoted sin and uglyness.
--- 73006587
>>73006517
Oh yes, definitely, I went deep into philosophy and that's where I found Christianity to be true but yep nowadays people are way too nihilistic and hedonistic and that only leads to catastrophe. It's important not to compromise traditional values because if that fails everything else crumbles

Btw if you want to continue the convo you can add me on instagram @phantomoftheduck

It's an alternative account that I don't really use so I don't mind sharing it
--- 73006724

Thanks but I don't use any social media aside from 4chan. I would hate it to censor myself about so many topics. And I'm used to the anonymous system, having a personal account would feel strange to me.
(But I use pictures of this girl, because she looks a bit similar to me, and I call myself Lorry when I want to use a name online.)
--- 73006804
>>73006724
My approach with social media is a bit like ''is better to have it while not needing it than needing it and not having it'' I avoid it but I use it only to communicate with people but I try to avoid browsing it in general

It was pretty good talking to you though, I really hope things turn as good as they can possible go and you end up living a fulfilling life

I will try to quit 4chan and only post threads like this every 6 months or so to avoid temptation, I wish I could drop it and never come back but there are good people here too

I only stick around to care for my cats.

Nothing at all, except playing with my cats and caring for them of course, which I do with great love. Since I was a kid every single activity has been an annoyance to me. I only did things due to social obligations. I do not have a single memory of enjoying something, and as soon as I could I stopped doing things. Now I sleep, care for my cats, stare at the wall and browse 4chan for an hour or so, before even posting and reading starts feeling like an annoyance.

NTA but on the flipside no one knows that life also doesn't have meaning
Why so convinced you're correct? Because the majority all say the same thing, despite being hypocrites and struggling and holding it all in on a day to day basis? This board is honest, sees things for what it is. I'm aware that if everyone thought like R9K humanity would commit mass suicide.
Maybe that's not the worst idea considering we've destroyed the earth, let alone ourselves.

It all comes down to intelligence. I know for a fact that from an objective standpoint, I am not smart. For years I have seen damning evidence of my inability to think at the level of the average human. My mind is just straight up slower than most. Even outside book smarts, I also lack rationality, or any real ability to form opinions of my own. Any view I have was likely stolen from another soul. I find myself enjoying things because other people enjoy them.
There's some other, but it mostly boils down to "I'm different in a bad way and people will not like me." The intellect thing is sadly my most rational reason.

You don't like videogames, movies, music? You didn't like to play with toys as a kid? You didn't like playing hide and seek with your friends? Jumping rope? Football? It just sounds like you're projecting your current unhappiness into your childhood.

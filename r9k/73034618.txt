>>73034618 (OP)
they work if your taking them to do something you have in mind. if you just take them in your bedroom you'll probably just jerk off for 12 hours and thats it

a legal alternative for ritalin would be powdered caffine or just really strong coffee. the simulating effects arnt nearly as strong but it should make a difference?

And caffeine powder and pills suck ass plus energy drinks are expensive over a long duration of time

- methylphenidate isn't amphetamine or amphetamine-derived

- it could possibly help, yes

yeah this happens to me most of the time I take it. honestly it feels so good that I have zero regrets. I probably should, but I don't. and the times I do actually get work done, I get so much done it makes up for the lost hours spent masturbating

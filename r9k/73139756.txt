I'm making a content platform that only contains data from the good times aka 2000-2012.

Good idea?
I wanna live in those times and immerse myself in the digital gold that existed back then.

These days someone out there is archiving everything. Analyzing everything. Profiling.
In 2008 I was FREE. Now it feels like there's a surveillance camera pointing at me.

I'm so fucking sad. I've been in a relationship with a sweet girl who has bpd for a year and a half. I was her whole world and suddenly she started to demonize me more frequently for harmless things, and she fantasizes against her will as intrusive thoughts with other men, coworkers, or actors, wonders if they'll be better than me, etc. She never fantasized about these things before and I don't know if the relationship is just breaking down slowly... She gets intrusive thoughts about how cheating would solve all her problems and stuff but tells me she doesn't want that. She used to cheat on their exes but never did cheat on me, I don't know what to think. I don't want to lose her.

You just have to hit them and they will stop whatever it is theyre doing to you, BPD girls are really simple when it comes down to it

Well if you dont want to lose her, learn to embrace the cuck.She seems to have moral, but variety is a human need and you can never destroy this type of urge, it will come back again and again.She will cheat on you eventually but this also doesnt mean she is replacing you wholly with that, just wants more spice in her life.

>dating a woman with BPD
I don't understand why any man would do this to themselves? You honestly only have yourself to blame OP.

I hate to say it op, but oyu're just asking for trouble dating a bpd girl. Yes it's a great whirlwind, especially in the beginning, and especially when you're used to being ignored by girls, but holy fuck do these relationship usually end in flames. That personality type is classified as a disorder for a reason. I wouldn't hold on too tightly op

It's not guaranteed she would still be with me in a relationship where she cheated, because she also gets urges about idealizing other men and thinking they are better in every regard to me and that she should dump me and be with them.

I got extremely attached and don't want to lose her...

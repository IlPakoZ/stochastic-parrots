Nobody around here will hire me because nobody's hired me before. I can't do most wagie jobs since my feet bones are fucked up and I can't stand for more than a couple hours. I'm a sperg, but not retarded. 
How can I get on NEETbux? I do have a certificate but there's no jobs for it around here.

if in the states, you can try for major depression. It requires a 3 day hold, then applying, getting turned down (they always turn down the first application) and applying again and again until you get it. You might have to get a lawyer.

Now you have asset limits or payments get docked, are expected to get other government programs like EBT, section 8 housing and medicaid. Every few years they will try to reevaluate you to kick you off.

Good summary. You can also self-fund if you have enough money. Dividends and income funds give anywhere between 4 and 10% return so if you want 10k a year, put in 100k.

In France this alone allows me to get 850 euros a month. Still can't go out of my parents home with that but it's nice pocket money.

Never said it was easy, just that there are NEETs that do it.

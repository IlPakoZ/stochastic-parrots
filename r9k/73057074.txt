getting shit on by boomers most likely.
you need hand strength to get filters off and you need to know which screw is the right one to drain oil. fairly easy if you know which it is but hard if you dont. also a balance where you need to tighten it enough but not too much, oil tap screws break easy, better the screw than the bottom of the engine but fat chance they have spare screws lying around.

This is the main thing I'm afraid of. How can I get that hand strength ASAP? I can't even do one fucking pushup. As for the screws and stuff, I shouldn't have too hard of a time knowing what's what. I've been watching a shit ton of tutorials and reading a lot.

A comfy job if it's a good place that doesn't make you do both sales shit and oil work. You don't need hand strength this other anon is retarded. Shit is covered in old/bunt oil and grease no amount of hand strength fixes that. There's wrenches to get the filters off. Just listen to whoever is in charge of you I'd be surprised if it took you more than a day to get it. Most you'll need is for someone to tell you where the filter actually is occasionally.

Sounds good. I'm a relatively fast learner so I don't think it should be a problem. However, it's a Valvoline so they're probably gonna make me do the sales shit but whatever. I really just need a job.

no just biased because in mechanic school the filter wrench was locked away in the teachers office for some fucking reason. if we were lucky there was room to hammer a screwdriver through the filter but mostly we had to wipe off the grease and oil and just fucking screw it off with our hands. this one dude had to always ask for help from others. 
never took my apprenticeship tho so i dunno how actual workshops do it.

amazing how Makima's simple business outfit works so well. How is it that a smart, simple woman's suit is becoming iconic?

All women who have existed, do not exist or will exist will only every go for Chad
It is biology

How do they live out their dominant side then? Chad isn't going to let them do anything degrading to him.

Actually, truly dominant? Maybe 1% of the already few women who claim/identify as dominant. The extreme majority of women who claim to be dominant aren't actually when push comes to shove

You'd be surprised how many Chads with femdom fetishes are out there.
--- 73017118
>>73016846 (OP)
yea they do.
it varies, but usually they are lgbt in some way and are very left leaning. i recommend probably looking for bi chicks who are leftists, they are your best bet.

Not chads then.

I am right wing and nationalist but not gonna lie, the idea of a tankie/radfem girl defeating, humiliating and converting me sounds hot...

Gee, that was a difficult question to answer.

They might as well not, there are so few of them. By a limited estimate ~20% of men are subs, the absolute maximum percentage of dominant women is ~5%. Counting switches, who almost universally prefer to be submissive.
>What kind of men do they date?
Men who pay them to act dominant for an hour or so (all pro dommes are subs and will only do it for money).

there are none, i'm a dominant girl and most subby guys are ugly/short/skinny/femboys which is a shame. a tiny % of guys are into it are chads because they are already owned. yeah, i'd rather die alone than dom some ugly fag

Look at Bonobo culture. It is matriarchal, about the closest thing that you can actually get in reality to a world run by dominant females.
Researchers identify four key patterns of behaviour in this kind of "society" that separates them from chimps, who are patriarchal:

1) Resources are abundant, which means that the males don't grow any traditionally masculine skills such as hunting or tool use because they simply aren't needed. 
2) Sex is a purely social thing. It has no meaning. Everyone just fucks each other, no strings attached. It is impossible to identify the father of any given chimp because every female has just fucked whoever. 
3) The mother's compete with each other for status, and only intervene on the males behalf when it is their son. This is literally the only way for males to gain status in the group.
4) The females also compete for the fittest, most aggressive fathers, and do so behind the backs of the males who often oust this particular male from the group.

So if you want to live in a world where you are a disposable pussy without any kind of status whatsoever, thrown only a pity fuck on occasion by women who do not even see you as socially relevant, loved only by your mother while she and everyone else is secretly cucking you with Chad while willingly keeping it from you at any cost, then go back and get born as a Bonobo male.
Know the best part? Bonobo and Chimp females aren't particularly choosy when it comes to mates but human females are. Primates will fuck anyone but go out of their way to fuck Chad; Human women on the other hand display an instinctual revulsion for any male that isn't up to extremely high standards, which means that a Bonobo style human society is exactly the same, just without the pity sex. 

If you think this sort of society actually sounds familiar, then congratulations, you've found out we're living in a Gynocracy. Welcome to female paradise, anon!

find a broken boy with big potential and fix him with a carrot and stick approach. you can't expect your partner to already be perfect.

They exist and unironically go for trannies

this is the thing guys don't realize. the dating market is horrible for us, every single guy who is remotely attractive has 100s of girls interested in him. we end up competing for him with each other which is horrible. our only other option is what? go for men we're not attracted to? no thanks

You probably cant hold a conversation either go away boring lol
--- 73075732
>>73075714 (OP)
i've only added one, he was nice and interesting but we had literally 0 things in common and couldn't find anything to talk about.
--- 73075733
>>73075714 (OP)
What have you done to earn contact with someone who can hold a conversation? Are you a 10/10, or exceptionally gifted, are you a millionaire/billionaire or a famous actress?

You're not special enough for entertaining conversation.

I don't talk to anyone who uses discord. I find them all to have a varying degrees of social retardation.
It's best to have an actual conversation irl, if you can't get that, guess what? You're a social retard too.

>>73075739
Which is why its a waste of time. Don't bother with women who aren't attracted to you, they're not going to put out, they'll use you emotionally/"platonically".
--- 73075757
>>73075714 (OP)
You can't. You're probably sending dry messages.
--- 73075763
>>73075752
but the ones who are attracted to me are also attracted to anyone with a dick and are total whores so yeah i'd rather not date anymore
--- 73075769

You are not even white lol stfu

Girly, they do not even talk. lol
I wish I had someone talkative who is completely different from me. I would settle down at least

>>73075733
Does not make sense?

I do not talk to people irl much, I am afraid of being judged.

you need to remember a lot of guy here are shy.
did you ask questions and make it clear you were interested in what he was talking about to lessen his anxieties??

>I do not talk to people irl much, I am afraid of being judged. 

this is how they feel all the time.
try to be more engaging until they feel comfortable opening up to you.

Why bother you chicks have nothing at all to say or talk about. Tried over 10 years. You dont put in effort so why should I? Only genuine conversation anyone can get anymore is from guys. Because I'm not going to twist arms anymore just to talk to someone.
--- 73075843

ur expectations probably ruined ur interactions.

i feel nothing for these fags, it is pitiful to backstab your ego for attention
--- 73075961
>>73075822
What the fuck is this. This can't be real, right? Are we at a point where we make troll threads like this. You are a male that makes posts on internet where you act like a young woman that can't hold a conversation. Just so you can get an easy reaction out of lonely and depressed men. Please seek help.

I added a girl (I assume it's a girl because trannies are more desperate than attention) from here and just stopped texting after like 4 texts because I realized she isn't trying to have a conversation at all. Not everyone here is a braindead simp. Some people just don't want to have a conversation with you
--- 73076002
i ghosted the first girl that craved my attention so that she would be very sad. she even posted about me sometimes here

Maybe you're just boring?
I rarely add people on discord but when I do I almost always have a nice time talking with them

i hate how eeryone is getting baited when it's clear that either she is talking to chads and they're not interested beyond nudes or hook ups or she is talking to ugly guys so she puts zero effort
--- 73076634
I added this girl and she started blogging about all the Chads she's been railed by over the years including 3 from /r9k/ eventually I got fed up and blocked her. 

Disgusting.

And who's to say you're not the one that is trying to talk?
I've made the effort only for women to lie and play the victim, they ghost and post here about how they can't find a decent chat.
You're a liar like them too I bet.

if you are a biological female i will talk to you or listen to your bullshit. if not belt stairway yourself.
--- 73077711
In my experience thus far, all the women on 4chan are young and have very, very serious mental illness. None of them have come to terms with it, and most of them are immature as hell. I suppose that makes sense being that they claim they're 19 but are in fact 14 or something. I mean, by the time I was 19 I'd traveled around the world on my own, flying to different countries. I'd had girlfriends, I got along with tons of people. I was never talented, never particularly skilled in anything and never very funny. Maybe I'm what you'd call a "chad", but if so I suspect you have the worst eyesight ever or some extreme and severely detrimental form of mental retardation requiring you to wear a drool absorbing bib and ice hockey helmet at all times. Young women these days are absolutely no different from at any time. Little cry babies here on 4chan I assume are mostly actors laughing and troll fishing for little fishes to bite their bait. It's really neither funny nor entertaining even looking in at it. It's just sad that such intellectually inept dimwits would derive pleasure from smushing and mashing and rechewing prechewed predigested shit in their mouths and passing it mouth-to-mouth between themselves (not gay).

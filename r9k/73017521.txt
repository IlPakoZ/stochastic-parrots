> I was invited to an alumni networking event at my college tonight
I was in something of an honors program at my school, and I met this girl that made me feel some kind of way
> LSS she had a bf, and I know it shouldn't but devastated me
I saw her at the same event last year, and admittedly had a few shots of scotch in the car before, and kinda fumbled when I saw her, she still had a bf
> This happened on my birthday, went home, drank until I passed out
> I've done a lot since then though
Not for her sake, just general improvement
> Continued to lose weight, and tack on muscle, really like the way I look
Gotta be careful though, a bad meal and I blow up like a fucking blimp
> Grew my beard out, couldn't do it during covid cause the masks irritated my face if it wasn't shaved
> Got myself a professional job, in my field, got hired as full time salaried, a few months back
> Become a bit more social, and grown my network
I'm trying not to put any expectations on this
> For all I knoe she won't even be there
> I even went out and bought myself a nice Ralph Lauren shirt, not just for this event because I can wear it to other stuff too, but I thought I might as well look nice
But I hope I can see her, I don't know what will happen, I don't know what I'll say, and I have a feeling that it doesn't matter anyway
Maybe it'll just be satisfying to tell her how successful I've been in spite of her rejecting me
Or maybe I'll just be happy to see her

Gas the kikes before you let them snuff your spirit out completely
They lied to your parents with their undeserved medical authority and sold your foreskin to a cosmetics company for the stem cells
They convinced your mother it would prevent her having to clean out your dick cheese and save her 200$ off the overinflated medical cost of childbirth and they got to your father before you so he would narcissistically mutilate you in his image

My circumcision is why i dont even feel that bad leeching off my parents. The scar is literally in the exact middle of my dick, they cut off EVERYTHING. I have hairs going up to the middle of my shaft because my erections pull the skin from the surrounding area to compensate. Dry skin flakes off from the middle shaft upwards. I have no frenulum, no natural lubrication or oils, nothing. When my mom asked me if she had ever done me wrong, i said she circumcised me and she laughed. Shes not even american, she came from central america and my cousins from there arent mutilated. Even beyond the other shit my parents put me through, the fact they did this to me is just another good excuse for leaching off of them as long as possible.

A 2008 study by Indian researchers ranked eight hairless skin sites in terms of density of Meissner's corpuscles, and concluded that the foreskin is last on the list.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298132136_Density_And_Structural_Variations_Of_Meissner%27s_Corpuscle_At_Different_Sites_In_Human_Glabrous_Skin

A 2016 study by Queens University PhD candidate Jennifer Bossio confirms that the foreskin is more sensitive to fine touch, but also measured other types of sensitivity. She found that the foreskin, while more sensitive to heat and pain than the glans, was not more sensitive than areas on the penile shaft. She concluded that "circumcision does not appear to remove the most sensitive part of the penis."

#1. Adult Male Circumcision: Effects on Sexual Function and Sexual Satisfaction in Kisumu, Kenya:
Sexual function parameters and results at 24 months pre- vs. post-operative included inability to ejaculate (1.3% vs 1.2%, respectively), premature ejaculation (PE; 3.9% vs 4.6%), pain during intercourse (0.7% vs 1.2%), lack of pleasure during intercourse (1.8% vs 1.0%), difficulty achieving/maintaining erection (2.3% vs 1.4%), or any of these dysfunctions combined (6.2% vs 5.8%). No statistically significant differences were found in frequency of any of the parameters

#2. The effect of male circumcision on sexual satisfaction and function, results from a randomized trial of male circumcision in Rakai, Uganda:
In this study 2210 men were circumcised. Male "sexual satisfaction" was reported at 98.5% pre-op vs 98.4% at 24 months post-op. 97.1% of female partners reported either "no change" or "improved sexual satisfaction". In regards to "how satisfied are you with the outcome", 99.5% of men reported at 24 months post-op being "very satisfied". Sexual function, based on the ability to achieve and maintain an erection (99.7% vs 99.9%, respectively), difficulty with vaginal penetration (0.6% vs 0.1%), difficulty with ejaculation (0.3% vs 0.1%), and pain during or after intercourse (0.1% vs 0.4%), did not differ significantly between each group at the end of the 24-month evaluation.

#1: Tian et al in 2013: meta-analyses of data from 10 studies.
6 studies had data on erectile dysfunction (6,826 circumcised and 6,052 uncircumcised men in total), 3 on ejaculatory latency time (ELT; 309 vs 332 men), 5 on PE (7,695 vs 6,326 men), 4 on sexual desire low or lacking (6,826 vs 6,052 men), 4 on orgasm difficulties (6,683 vs 5,727 men), and 6 on dyspareunia (8,288 vs 6,894). For each dysfunction, no statistical difference was found between circumcised and uncircumcised men.

To end it, anecdotal evidence also tends to show that circumcision doesn't lead to a significant or even measurable change in pleasure. Many subreddits about circumcision, for countless reasons be it religious or medical, and the concensus is that it helped them and after a time of adaptation didn't change their sex life negatively.
--- 73089258
>>73087554 (OP)

Yes and you deserve it. This was god pre-emptively punishing you for being a faggot trying to make people depressed over a traditional procedure with no risk or adverse effect when done correctly. Your parents should have asked a religious doctor to do it, they know how to do it well. The redditors on r/circumcision all went to a religious doctor specialized in ritual circumcision, never to a regular doctor. However I've been researching about foreskin restoration and it's highly positive that the technology to regrow sensitive parts of the penis either exists or is close to existing. If anything happens I'll drop the data on /r9k/. You probably learned your lesson.

>>73089395
You are mistaken as well, I posted studies from western nations done by western professors but you ignored that, which is interesting.

>>73089433
First of all, the idea that once one part of it is gone it's impossible to feel pleasure is retarded. You can still feel pleasure, just not from a certain place. The glans is and will always be the most sensitive part of the penis, by far. As long as you have it it's not over. You can try to overly take care of your glans to make up for the lose of frenulum, which means keeping it hydrated with coconut oil often to avoid keratinization. A lot of people are drama queens, well that's the nature of 4chan really, when it wasn't about circumcision, it was about other things, they never show them like what they really are and just over react and cry. Turning a rock into a moutain, too much drama really.
--- 73089469
>>73089449
Its not going to help if your frenulem is gone. The frenulem is the male clitoris.
--- 73089500
>>73089469
Sadly true, the frenulem has a high meissner index compared to the preputium. However as I said it doesn't mean it's over, the same way a woman can enjoy sex without having her clitoris stimulated.

https://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/sorrells_2007/ foreskin is important for pleasure

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34564796/
810,719 non-Muslim Danish males circumcised during infancy or childhood were studied over 22 years. No correlation was found between circumcision and HIV, however, circumcision was correlated with increased STIs overall, and significantly positively correlated with anogenital warts and syphilis.

One of the studies 
you posted literally says

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298132136_Density_And_Structural_Variations_Of_Meissner%27s_Corpuscle_At_Different_Sites_In_Human_Glabrous_Skin

A 2016 study by Queens University PhD candidate Jennifer Bossio confirms that the foreskin is more sensitive to fine touch

So that means that the foreskin is still a part of pleasure, whether major or minor. 

The african study compared recently circumcised men, which havent had decades for their the head of the penis to keratinize. 

Even if all of the changes are minor (they arent) that still doesnt change the fact that you are a subhuman who wants to mutilate literal newborn babies right out of the womb for your jewish overlords. Why do you even defend this shit?
--- 73089544
>>73089536
It depends. Some people have a short frenulum and they're fine. But I'm talking about the case in OP's pic. That for example is a case of a frenulum completely removed.
--- 73089555
>>73089544
Yeah. Shame
--- 73089579
>>73089542
Those fine touch receptors aren't there for erotic stimulation or pleasure.

 "We measured heat detection and heat pain by attaching a thermode to the penis. Men would indicate either when they would feel a change in temperature or when it hurt. The nerve fibers in the penis that are activated by temperature and pain are more relevant in sexual functioning or the feel of a sexy touch than the light touch that past researchers had done. Even though [the foreskin] is more sensitive to light touch, I suspect that isn't implicated in sexual pleasure."

Keratinization is a problem and I indeed take it into account, however all it requires is to regularly moisturize your glan to counteract. You yourself admit that it's not about the foreskin but the glans.

Don't know what to tell you about the muslim study, there are countless out there proving it's beneficial for preventing STDs and such.

And as I said, no, it isn't.
--- 73089601
>>73089542
And again, you're an overemotional child. I'd never circumcise my child because it's unnecessary, I'm just proving that you fags can't use it as an excuse to give up and be a leech (literally posted ITT, a faggot just leeches off his parents over it with no shame) because it does not fuck up your dick, like at all. But reality is secondary to people like you. Also lmao your source is fucking CIRP, talk about conflicting interests. You are truly shameless.
--- 73089611
>>73089579
>ignoring https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34564796/

It is about the foreskin, it should be a choice that the adult makes to get rid of it, and children dont know about anybod this shit and by the time they do its too late. And like i fucking said, it does not matter even IF the changes are minor, you are mutilating literal babies.
--- 73089623
>>73089611
I am not doing anything, you are again being hyper emotional, please calm yourself it's like talking to a woman, very very annoying. You literally just ignoring everything I posted too faggot, and now you act like I'm the one who started that. Address my points first, you just posted your shit and said "yeah well mine said otherwise!". If your source is CIRP no shit, it would be posting studies showing smoking is good for you that are financied by cigarette companies.
--- 73089644
>>73089611
I am not saying what you think I am. My point is circumcision isn't as bad as you fags make it out to be. Literally, that's it. Of course there are changes, of course a child should have consent over that, and yes if the frenulum is removed (which mutts doctors do) it's way worse. Look at this guy.

>indian study
So the corpuscles are still there, and they are lost with circumcision
>Queens study
Again the foreskin is still a part of the penis and is a major part for lubrication, and the gliding motion also helps during sex
>Adult male circumcision in kenya
No significant difference, sure whatever it is still a completely functional organ you are removing
>uganda
Africans fetishize circumcision, plus of course before it keratinizes an uncovered glans will be sensitive
>tian et tal
No statistical difference, so you again theyre cutting around your dick for no reason

Americans and third worlders literally fetishize circumcision so obviously they are going to like it

How about you just dont cut off a functioning organ for no reason?

For i some reason, when I try to imagine a circumcised penis with a foreskin on it, the imagination as such falls so far short of what I have between my legs. I get accused of being flowery or poetic, but for all my efforts I can't satisfactorily get into words how it really is. It's the closest thing to Heaven that I know, the most perfect 'design' possible. The sensitivity, but moreover how it actually works. The foreskin tube somehow floats so effortlessly on secretions smoother than anything I can think of. I don't need any external stimulation in the form of visuals: the penis itself from how incredibly sexually well it works, and how impossibly good it feels, means that an incredible enjoyment is had even if the girl is not especially attractive, and even if there is no girl at all.

Maybe one day I will think up how I can put into words what so far has so stumped me. You'd think it shouldn't be so hard. But then man isn't made to understand life and the universe. He's just a sort of toy in an unfathomably mysterious existence.
--- 73091549
>>73091527
So you agree that the loss of the frenulem is the loss of true pleasure yet you are still trying to say it doesn't cause a lot of damage. A lot of people have their frenulem ablated.

I had to get my foreskin removed when I was like around 12 and ever since I've felt like either they fucked it up or my dick is just deformed, because my frenulum (or just some of the foreskin) is still there but it's not in the center and it's on the right side. Can someone please tell me if that's normal or not? I feel like if a girl ever saw my dick (not that it would ever happen) she'd probably laugh and make fun of it for being weird like that.

I'm anti-circumcision but we gotta get better with the propaganda memes. Anyone who has seen 1 porn video can see that's just a picture of a hard dick vs a soft one. Once they realize the meme is lying, they're aren't going to believe anything else you say.

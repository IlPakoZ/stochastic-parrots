Do you have a crush or do you love someone? I think it would be interesting to know what are you experiencing because I have no affection towards women and I just feared of them. I think my endless cooming affected me at some point. Maybe that was accompanied by overbearing mother and zero experience. So please tell what do you think about it and why it happening

I usually only like the idea of being with a woman but they rarely attract me. Real women are too far away from my expectations. I am pretty sure that one girl exists somewhere but not for me.

I used to when I was back in school, but ever since I graduated I have barely if ever been around women my age so it's not like I have a chance to even form one

I am completely head over heels for someone. Unfortunately, she is married and I really should move on.

But I can't.

Just throw yourself into hobbies and improve yourself as much as you can. It's all we can do right now.

I think I'm starting to catch actual feelings for the first time, and I don't know how to feel.
I have to wonder if I'm only feeling anything toward her because she just happens to not hate me. But outside of that, she's a genuinely nice person to be around. A "ray of sunshine," if you will.
But I'd feel weird trying to act on it, and I doubt she'd see me as anything more than a friend. I like being her friend, anyway. I'd rather not have these feelings. Plus she's an online friend who doesn't live anywhere near me, so there's that.

Yeah. I've posted about her before. She's Russian, has red hair, and plays the bass. She's also supposedly nonbinary, asexual, and aromantic, which means that I have no chance with her. I still love her anyways. Such a kind and amazing person, not to mention how insanely gorgeous she is.

No I hate everyone with a fiery passion and think your species isn't worth dating. I hate you so much I go again my own biological imperative and would prefer death then spreading your horrible species

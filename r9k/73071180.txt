Unironically kill yourself please. I would rather die than live in such an overpopulated hellhole.

Northeast Coast is one of the only good places in the US that isn't like North Dakota (low nigger density). 

Anyway, just shut your faggot mouth and stop talking. Maybe you should just shut up if you're scared to talk over a microphone. Maybe you just go fuck yourself, you little shit.

Get drunk. Unironically.
I used to mix vodka and redbull and have a ball on TF2.
Energy drinks and alcohol produce the best mixture to make you simultaneously charismatic and good at video games.

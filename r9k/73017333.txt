35% ? You really sure you aren't going to change your program and go for a different degree?

I dropped out twice. I managed to crawl to the final semester and by all metrics should be able to get my diploma in june but my bachelors work is absolute dogshit garbage and I have to turn it in on the 2nd of May so I think I will drop out for the third time.

Why do you cut? I was real depressed in some point of my life but I never thought of self harm, just suicide.
--- 72939310
>>72939075
there are many reasons why somebody would hurt themselves
I have two main reason, 
first, sometimes I get more detached/depressed than usual and I feel hollow and very bored
Hurting myself helps me get back to normal quicker 
The other reason is self hate, I dislike myself a lot and sometimes I get very angry at myself and hurting myself helps me calm down and take out my anger 

Disclaimer: self harm is not a good coping mechanism, I realize that and I try to reduce the amount I do it

Goona go to the doctors on Monday and scared they will see my scars when they do my bloodwork. I really need to lean scar makeup.
--- 72939484
>>72939363
how visible are your scars?

if they don't look fresh the they probably won't even notice them
and even if they do they prolly won't even say anything unless you're under 18
 
Don't worry

lol in addition to my antidepressants suddenly stopping to be effective, my anxiety is also spiking to the point where I can't leave my room. taking a couple benzos and hoping this isn't gonna put me in a spiral where it gets worse once they wear off.

got a psych appointment next week and hopefully I'll be in a state to actually go cause fuck me this is a nightmare.

>>72941047
Hii, thank you for the bump and nice words
My day is actually pretty good, it was a little busy but surprisingly I'm not tired also I had an exam today and I'm sure I passed it :D 
How's your day?
--- 72941538
I was washing the dishes today and I started having difficulty doing this for some reason. The sink was messy and I started overthinking this menial task, and ended up panicking. Then I started breathing slower and telling myself to just do things one step at a time. Then I remembered how when I was a small kid I liked puzzle games but was too impatient to take my time, and would abandon them if I couldn't find the solution by myself in a couple of minutes. It was the same in middle school, where I would start crying and hitting myself in the head if I couldn't solve a math problem, and whenever I tried to study any subject I'd only actually read for five minutes before closing the books and becoming frustrated that I couldn't recite them word for word. My therapists would lie that I was a "smart kid" who could "think faster than they could express their ideas" (something they probably told all of the ADHD retard kids) and being the pampered narcissist that I was, I believed it. A little redditor Dunning-kruegerling up until I was 12. And my lack of patience and discipline was only amplified by having unsupervisionised access to the internet from age 8. I was a complete dopamine addict before I finished puberty. And when I realized I actually wasn't as smart as I though at about 13, I buried myself more and more in my dopamine rushes to ignore how retarded I was. And when that wasn't enough, I turned to self harm 16 instead of trying to fix my problems, step by step, because (just caught myself almost self deprecating here) it's a more comfortable alternative to looking at what is wrong with you and making an effort to fix it. And then I wished I could just forgive myself, forgive myself for my ugliness, for my limitations, move on from self hatred and at the very least try to fix myself. I cried for the first time in a while. The only other time I remember crying is when I had to explain to my mom that I had cut myself because I hated myself.

i only harmed myself once in high school to get some hot emo chick to notice me. 
she made fun of me.
--- 72941973
>>72941538
Hai Bile 
wow that's a lot of words and it's very personal
Are you feeling better after writing it all?
I hope so 
Who would have thought that such a mundane task like washing the dishes could send somebody down such a retrospective journey, do you often think about your past? 
I think sharing your thoughts with us was a good idea because it allows others to look at what you've gone through from a different perspective and draw different conclusions, maybe there's somebody who feels just like you who might offer you help 

I'm sadly not great and don't feel qualified enough to analyze what you've said and offer advice, I feel like I have a constant brain fog, sorry 
I hope you find a way to forgive yourself 
and thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, you're brave

yesterday was wonderful and amazing and i also went to school on time for the first time in a couple weeks. today i slept until noon and didnt go. tomorrow i will go on time. i really really cannot affort to miss anymore school now.
its quite hot outside and parents wont put on the ac yet. i'll live. its very nice to hear the birds sing. 
i went outside but there was music coming from somewhere (picrel) so i went inside and made pierogis. and ate other things and my tum aches a bit. i miss my big bf. i love his place he has so many guns and its very cozy and we made hotdogs and beans together and he sexed me so hard heh. thank god for /soc/ LoL.

Sometime last year. I was hitting myself on the forehead.
>Why did you hurt yourself?
Friend, the same one, was arrested in front of me and the stress of that and school was very stressful

That Im a gullible retard. No one really wants to be my friend for the sake of being my friend.

Hiya mioposter :D
you've got the right guy
I described most of my day today here >>72941272
and if you mean how I'm doing in general, I'm doing okay, I've been better but I'm definitely not doing bad 
I don't know what else to say about how I'm doing
I'd say that "if you have any more questions feel free to ask"but I it's 12pm here and I gotta wake up at 6am tomorrow and I shouldn't say up any longer
 
besides that, how are you doing?

>>72942482
Hello hello it's nice to see you 
>well done, my friend.
thank you :3
>i was a bit worried
no need to worry 

sadly I need go to sleep now because I gotta wake you early tomorrow so goodnight everybody
I'll make sure to be extra snug tonight and make the most out of my short sleep
--- 72942858

>i want to be drunk i want another i want to cry
i hate my brain sometimes i wish i could go back to when nobody knew about my fucking issues and how i could get alcohol from my brothers every weekend and i was drunk everyday forever. im only 18 and worry what will happen when i turn 21. i just need to get a license so i can buy drinks from little no ID place.
--- 72943547
>>72943432
what do you have to remove anon?
--- 72943577
>>72943547
I assume it is a ingrown hair.
--- 72943640
>>72943577
beans is really deep. maybe have some tweezers nearby, dont cut super deep maybe just enough to grab the hair with tweezers. but also if its big and sensitive i would reccomend maybe leaving it to a doctor if possible, considering it could get all infected and things. i really wouldnt reccomend cutting at all but if you truly think its the only option in this particular situation, just make sure its all clean
--- 72943674
>>72943640
any tips on avoiding infection?
--- 72943807
>>72943674
change bandages daily (at least. if you are bleeding through before the day is over, maybe change it twice a day). pay attention to the healing process- dont ignore the cut. sometimes smell the wound, give the area a little poke if youre unsure how the nerves react to touch (if its red and super sensitive and stinky and producing pus, it could be infected). keep the area clean, everytime you change the bandage, give it a little wash with warm water and mild soap. using a washcloth and working in small gentle circular motions can help if you need to wash off blood that doesnt want to budge. ive used neosporin many times which seems to help. its also very important to treat your body well- get good rest, eat and drink plenty of water as your immune system fights against any bacteria that enters through the cut. stay safe anon

Does anyone have a self harm connection to OCD? I keep thinking things(universe wise) will go better if I cut, I also think about how I also feel much better
I'm bipolar too, I'll do anything if I can feel anything other than misery
--- 72944924
>How are you doing today?
pretty okay, idk
>Any plans for today?
its the end of the day so sleep soon
>When was the last time you hurt yourself?
5-6 months ago
>Why did you hurt yourself?
the last time was because my boyfriend constantly ignoredm e and didnt love me
>Is there anything bothering you right now?
i feel like the guy im talking to doesnt really like me either
--- 72944930
>>72939075
is fun I like the blood no hurt
--- 72945053
>How are you doing today?
I'm high on shard and feeling desperate for any type of affection
>Any plans for today?
Just going to let myself play OSRS until sleep. I'm also letting some homeless neighbors sleep over. Maybe another line if he picks up. Weed either way, I plan on smoking more weed.
>When was the last time you hurt yourself?
It was 21. I cut a few horizontal scars into my arm. They are basically uniform. I felt awful.
>Why did you hurt yourself?
I felt bothered by lack of sexual intercourse and was feeling extremely embittered by lack of affection. I never did my limerent object yet. Then, that person was also very demeaning and intimidating to me, implying they would hurt me if I got close. It hurt my feelings and left me out of sex for even longer. I just needed a visit, I felt no need to do anything but attempt that she hated me.
>Is there anything bothering you right now?
I am out of vodka, for one thing. And she hasn't been in contact for another. I think her kid dislikes me so much that it's a dealbreaker - he said he hated me, now I'll be alone forever and shit. I just want my sexy slut to be my munchkin. If she can't find me soon than I may cut again and tell about it at the emergency room, where they will ignore me and possibly have me raped send me to the psych unit. I think I have to.
--- 72945700
Heyo
cutting has been slowly inching itself into my stream of consciousness lately. ive been busy taking care of shit, and somehow in that process i feel like im losing myself. like i ran errands for 12 hours yesterday and figured out a bunch of legal stuff, and i feel good for completing my dumb little tasks, but i also feel less human for it somehow. more and more im thinking of just giving myself quick little cuts, physical reminders of my inner self for my material self to look at. idk. i guess i just wanna see my blood come out too. that feels more real than anything im doing right now, and lord knows dissociation is my modus operandi at all times.

yes what catbro said, they probably wont say anything. also if scars are only on one arm, you can request that they take blood from the other arm, and they always have agreed, no questions asked.

>>72947618
i am not convinced. i pretty much only browsed /b/ before a month ago. sometimes /soc/. i thought this board might be a tiny bit better but honestly after tonight, i really never want to return or speak to any of these people again. i feel like the chaos of this place feels safe in the same way is does in my house. its just familiar but oh so unhealthy and i hate it here i hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it ihate it hi hate it ii hate it

R9k is different this is a board for lonly people yes but most have become incels and they hate most woman for turning this place into a simp place so it is better not to say or post pictures of you being a girl and I'm not scolding you just saying
--- 72947891
>>72947641
hey, muddy. 

>i thought this board might be a tiny bit better
i'm quite new to this board, but i never got that impression. it's just this thread. at least for me. 

>i really never want to return or speak to any of these people again.
sorry to hear that. i was feeling bad for not engaging with you, but i thought you had nice conversations with other people here and i tried to not be overbearing and to not barge into every single one of them. maybe that was a mistake. i don't know. yesterday i was so tired that i immediately fell asleep after posting, so i again made up an excuse for not replying to you. i'd like to talk to you and for you to stay, but sometimes i just don't know how to approach and maybe it's too late know. sorry.

>its just familiar but oh so unhealthy
it probably is. it's social media after all. i don't think there's a single safespace on this site. there's no way to gatekeep here. for better and for worse.

It's hard to describe, but it was me being decent at the skills I've tried to pursue, what was weird though was the constsnt sensation of liquid dripping across my body
--- 72949032
>>72948901
that must habe been an odd feeling. i don't think i ever had that while dreaming. is it the first time you had that or is it recurring? in the last dream i remember my hand was infested by these botfly-like bugs. i was not even shocked or disgusted, just so annoyed i had to deal with that on top of other things... anyway, i'm off to work now. bye.
--- 72949056
>>72943530
I feel you, I can never drink casually at work events or dinner parties or any other shit because if I'm taking a sip of alcohol I'm getting completely shitfaced. There's no point if I'm only having 1-2 drinks. Also I'm definitely a drug addict, so you're probably an alcoholic.

>When was the last time you hurt yourself?
Long time ago, I've been using alcohol to cope since then
>Why did you hurt yourself?
I don't like myself. I feel pathetic and weak and by damaging myself I felt stronger, like I could defeat myself or something like that.
>Is there anything bothering you right now?
Im feeling very pessimistic lately. Even more than usual. I'm in college rn and barely make it through everyday social situations. No idea how I should survive in the workforce once I graduate, I haven't been able to keep a job for longer than a few months and most jobs I tried just made me wanna kms. 
Also I ate lunch with a sweet girl today and now I'm overthinking what I said to her
--- 72951685
still very tired, even after a nap D: 

>>72943432
 it very easy to get an infection so you shouldn't cut this deep but if you do make sure the area you cut, the tool you cut with and whatever you're gonna patch yourself up with is very clean, disinfect it
Also a wound that deep should get closed up asap, ideally with stitches, if you don't wanna get stitches use butterfly strips to close up the wound and don't do anything physical because those strips aren't very strong and your would might open up and get infected

>>72943530
what is do cool about being drunk?
I've never been drunk in my life 

>>72944355

no music sorry, I haven't really been listening to anything lately 

>>72944627
don't cut, you'll control over it and it'll just become another issue making your life worse

>>72944924
scars on your arms are nicely faded
Nice work staying clean :D 

>>72947603
>i knew this wasnt a safe space
it's really not, this general is pretty safe and doesn't get a lot of hate but this is /r9k/ and mean people are unavoidable, there's nothing we can do about it 
But don't think nobody cares, there are nice people here

If you feel this place is only making your mental state worse maybe you should leave but remember that you're always welcome to come back
and please don't cut, take care of yourself 

>>72948684
good work anon, sleep depravation sucks and is dangerous

It seems to represent self-harm, since that's how I came to know the feeling. The dream did remind me of my previous attempts to learn things as I've mentioned before, so the running blood is probably a recollection of the shing I did when I failed or thought I couldn't do something

Do appreciate y'all being here, though, even with the extra sleep I cannot stand my mind and the constant reminders I get of the past

yes, i'm back. time to relax and hang out with some lovely people. it was good. the late shift isn't as busy as the early one, so no, i'm not as tired. work was very taxing yesterday and then i had to entertain my friends the rest of the day. we want to meet up as often as possible until they head back home. i was just completely done by the end.

i think i know what you are talking about. when i was cutting myself i had these moments of hope that i could do and be anything if i cut as a way to calm down or feel better. its bs.

In a lot of back/leg pain nowadays. My life is pretty much a dead end do to mental problems and will be on disability for the rest of my life. No guy will ever want to date my tranny ass with all these mental prob and being ugly and not passing too. Tranny-kun says only a "pathetic loser" would want to date me yet still post say shit like just try so when i see him post it piss me off and makes me hate myself as a reminder of my vain pathetic life. Self harm my just be my new cope to not being able to end it

sounds plausible. do you analyse your dreams often? seems like you gave it some thought.

>even with the extra sleep I cannot stand my mind and the constant reminders I get of the past
give it time. memories are a lot like scars, i think. they'll stay with you, but the pain will be gone at some point and the strong emotions you had will also fade. that's how it was for me, at least.

>>72953236

im not even sure suddenly i started to get really sad and i ran into the bathroom and locked myself there. i was crying for an hour or so i tried to make cuts with my nails and by picking my skin. i sliced the kinfe on my leg a couple of times but i was shaking too much for it to do anything. i felt like i was going insane halfway through i couldnt even remember what started it. i went back after that still really sad but presentable. a friend gave me a hug and i cried into their arms for a solid 5 minutes. im feeling a bit better now thankfully.
--- 72954201
its getting rapidly worse by the minute. i was almost 3 months clean, then cut my shoulder. ~1.5 weeks later cut my forearm. another 9 days go by and i cut my arm again yesterday and im fighting tears again. all my friends are ignoring me so i go around messaging people i used to talk to, and now im ghosting them because i lost the connection and i cant just talk to someone due to mental issues :3
so yeah, im fine thanks *(^o^)*
--- 72954202
>>72953264
>when i was cutting myself i had these moments of hope that i could do and be anything 
Yeah this is why cutting can be so addictive. Its a feeling you can't get anywhere else, so you need to remove the need for this feeling if you want to stop cutting for good. At least that's what I remember from therapy

Also I'm back from swimming, it actually wasnt that bad. There were only a few old people. My thighs were covered and my arms are underwater and moving. Had to do some weird acrobatics in the changing room though

> actually made a skin for Mig-29 today, its this pantone 369 green camo. A skin about a certain band i like. I will personally suck off anyone who names the band.
well, got me there. no clue. didn't pay attention when you wrote about your taste in music. if you mentioned that band then, that is.

>>72953468
i played quite a bit of magic. even played arena for a while. drafting was by far the most enjoyable mode in that game. atm i'm playing the digimon tcg to scratch that itch. asl is a starcraft league, right?

>In a lot of back/leg pain nowadays.
that sucks. i'm not completely painfree, but i'm a lot better nowadays. do you know what causes the pain?

>My life is pretty much a dead end do to mental problems and will be on disability for the rest of my life.
a friend of mine has to deal with similar problems. nearly his whole family actually. but they are able to get by somehow. i'm sure you'll manage as well. i'm also not getting anywhere in life anymore. that's how it is. 

>No guy will ever want to date my tranny ass with all these mental prob and being ugly and not passing too.
i get you. i've got thoughts like that about myself ad well. i've somewhat managed to let go, but loneliness still get to me sometimes. when and how did you realize you were trans?

>Tranny-kun
doesn't seem like someone you should listen to. why don't you stay with us instead?

>Self harm my just be my new cope to not being able to end it
well, i don't think you should do either, but i can't really do anything to stop you. i'd just prefer if you didn't is all.

I'm sorry to hear that anon, don't feel bad for cutting, you're dealing with a lot of stuff so it's understandable and don't worry about stopping, you've been clean for almost 3 months before, you will bounce back and beat that record, I promise 
 I'm sending u a big virtual hug, stay strong
--- 72954495
>>72954041
i don't cry very often, but when i do it always helps to clear my mind and rids me of those awful emotions that i tried to supress. it's good you weren't able to hurt yourself and that you have such a good friend.

its a long story but my dad always wondered if i ever wanted to play an instrument. i eventually said synth but i guess he saw it as piano so he played his trick of buying something expensive and over the top when no one was really asking for it. would be cool if it never made me so so dissatisfied with myself. guess Ill start kaworumaxing (playing that damn piano)

>comfortable with. i'm very interested in your story, 
okay, so here goes
when i was little like in first grade or so i was short and not good at sports and also cried easily so it didnt take long for my classmates to call me a sissy faggot. this continued all the way till 6th grade so that whenever i cried my life was living hell because of the insults. since around 4th grade i was repressing my emotions about everything including my own identity i just asked like i should so people will like me or at least not make fun of me. when i grew my first facial hair i refused to shave it or whatever because it was my proof that i was a man and not some crybaby sissy fag. it was awful i cried very often just outside of view and eventually i just could cry at all for a while. i continued acting in a way that people wouldnt make fun of me. i eventually found a group of friends who were fun to hang out to and with a couple of exceptions had never called me a sissy fag or a crybaby apart from just making fun of each other as friends. i finally started to notice that maybe i could actually be myself with them. one of them eventually came out as trans and everyone was chill with it. a little while after that i finally noticed i could really be myself with these people so ive just been lettiing everything i repressed and all my feelings get expressed for once in years. i could barely cry for the past 2 years or so even though i was sad i only cried at really intense fights. that in part resulted in cutting as a way to let it our which hasnt been my best choice by a long shot at least now i know theres people who will accept me for who i am instead of who im supposed to be to accomodate their choices. i came out as pansexual once i realized that i wouldnt be bullied into oblivion ror it. i feel so much better being able to be like this even if it has its moments. lately i think though i may be a closeted tranny cuz reasons but character limit i can continue if you want

i have to admit that i don't selfharm, but even though i don't, i was welcomed here with open arms, which i am very grateful for. i might not fully understand the way you feel about cutting, but i'm sure that other people here can relate. 

>I wish my friends spoke to me about it instead of wanting me to cut infront of them
that seems like an awful thing to ask of you. why do your friends want you to do that? maybe you should talk to someone outside of your friendgroup about your issues. and please, when the urge arises and you don't have anyone to talk to irl, just come here.

thank you for sharing. that means a lot. i think a lot of boys went to similar experiences, where you have to lock your emotions up or lash out violently.

nah its that my life is boring so i do stuff like this to keep myself entertained i also id this but instead of nosleep it was no water so i didnt drink for 2 1/2 days 

well i failed, i was lisening to some music and my brain just turned of, i think i passed out or something like that because it didnt feel as sleep at all, when i woke up it was 2 am and then i just said fuck it and slept till 9 
the only hallucinations i had was hearing my younger sister downstairs while she was away

hey catposter, im glad youre feeling so wonderful

I think i need help. I am in this most anxious stage of a relationship where i want to be hers so much but she is also always talking to other guys. Like. . . even right now she said to me she is gaming with a friend. Last time we talked about this, she asked if i was restricting her from talking to other people, and said i should seek therapy and that she would help. But i dont get it, my worries are justified, how can i believe those guys arent out there wanting to fuck her if thats practically what happens every time a male and a female start getting close. i cant word this out. It is draining. and i cant meet her again for 2 weeks (explanation earlier in the thread).

Hello o/
I think considering that she probably knows her friends longer than she knows you and she trusts them, her reaction is justified (maybe the seeking therapy part is a bit over the top)
>thats practically what happens every time a male and a female start getting close.
I don't think that's true 
You shouldn't worry about her friends being sexually interested in her, if that was the case these people wouldn't be her friends (also her friends might be gay) 
And if we play devil's advocate, even if some of her friends were interested in her she wouldn't cheat on you

>as stupid as that sounds. I just want some skill to bring me joy ;_;
it doesn't sound stupid. being joyless has been the baseline for my existence for so long, sometimes it's hard for me to imagine that it can be different. i was playing a new game with a group of friends one evening. i really liked it and one of my friends said: "i think i have to process seeing him actually having fun with a game for once". same goes for skills and other stuff of course. i don't know. keep trying, i guess, as disheartening as it may be. you'll find something that sticks someday. 

>I hope you had a good rest, because I didn't

>you'll find something that sticks someday
I've done so much looking, but I always go back onto the roundabout and wanting to learn to draw or speak German. And I fail at both, so the cycle repeats. Maybe I can still learn German on my own, but it's impossible to find an art mentor in my field (last time I asked on how to find one I was laughed at)

>I always go back onto the roundabout and wanting to learn to draw or speak German.
so you have your goals set. that's good, i think. you just need to find the right way. i remember bob ross talking about how much he wanted to paint, but traditional painting was pure agony for him. then he found that "wet-on-wet" oil painting technique and he could finally do what he wanted in a way that was enjoyable to him. so i think we are back at what tools you are using. i'll dig around for a way to learn german. maybe i'll find something. maybe i should ask a friend. he's a teacher, after all...

>but it's impossible to find an art mentor in my field (last time I asked on how to find one I was laughed at)
why would they laugh at you? are teachers that rare where you live? 

>Lengthy "nap" in the day
yeah, i really try to avoid those. they just don't do me any good.

you think so? hm. have you tried focussing on one? i'd think of them as adjacent, but you are still trying to learn two skills at once, prolonging the time it takes to master either.

Attempting to make something that doesn't look like bad to show Mr. Yuanon (and going to add some examples of whag I want my art to be)
--- 72968096
>>72965645
I'm very sorry, but I just can't upload anything. I tried sketching a simple character but even fucking then I had to make a lot of attempts and got angry because it looked worse than before ;_;

A lot of what I've posted is similar to what I want to make, also think mid-noughties Touhou art, Gen 2 and 3 Pokemon character art as well as the manga up to BW, late 90s anime such as Lain Gainax Perfect Blue Ghost in the Shell mixed with some of the more inventive western stuff like Scott Pilgrim and Ongezellig (yes I enjoyed that, it is to date the only Dutch native animation I watched without subtitles, cry about it)

Genuinely, I will never be able to make anything satisfactory, I hate how everyone is born with the ability to do/make/achieve wonderful things- except for myself. Seeing people not even adults yet making bloody masterpieces and calling them "silly little doodles" makes me so unfathomably angry, because even with grinding I will never be able to hit the low bar that I've been trying for years

For christs sake I need pain and need it now, I can't stand my inability to do a single thing
--- 72968241
>>72968096
don't sweat it anon, it's okay
>making bloody masterpieces and calling them "silly little doodles"
I think it's because they don't take it as seriously as you, they just do it for the fun of it regardless if the result is good or not
Also it seems that artists are never satisfied with what they make and that's why they don't see it as "masterpieces" and I think you're like that too 
I'm sure your drawings don't look as bad as you think
--- 72968349
>>72968241
A nine year old could do better, I can't stand this anymore, being locked out of entire careers because I can't use my hands properly, I need a fucking live in master to show me how to do this, but I'd never find one willing to put up with my spastic self or even one at all

I want to be able to make things that make me happy, bring my fucking characters to life, but thank god I was born with a unique disability preventing me from learning any bloody thing

Have quite a bit of work to do for uni as the semester draws closer to its end. Wish I had good study habits. Grade school and high school were so braindead boring that I never bothered formulating study habits.
Cut myself yesterday, the most cuts I've ever done. Just really felt like crap, I think I overinteracted with people and got anxious from the semester ending. Had a beautiful sunset through the window and Radiohead (I know, faggy) playing. Cuts all over my left wrist and below the shoulder. Felt nice until today, I feel rough, to say the least. Plus, the weather is gray and bleh, which doesn't help.

>please do.
okay so here goes. 
as i said i was always called a sissy. ever since i was little i did "girly" things and i got picked on and sometimes bullied for it. i wasnt good and didnt like sports too so for small kids that automatically makes you a girl. that kind of thing continued for years. i had to change how i behaved and pay attention to what i did all the time so i didnt get picked on. ive always had a habit of sitting with my legs crossed and of course i got picked on. i liked digging in the dirt so one time i closed my hand and turned it to check my nails i kid you not some kid called me a girl for looking at my hands like that. at that point it wasnt even about really girly things, just anything that could be considered girly that i did was enough. i was also pretty quick to cry, and of course thats girly too so yea. due to that i had to repress a lot of emotions and things i did. eventually i became almost unable to cry and i checked everything i did before i did it so it was "okay". this gave me extreme social anxiety and it made me scared of mainly men because of that. i had suppressed these "girly" behaviors and i basically convinced myself to hate that kind of thing as a way to forget it and stop doing it. not too long after that full suppression that made me a bit homophobic and transphobic as a defense mechanism i met this friend who i said was trans. i already had a friend group and they didnt and never had told me any of those things so i felt a bit safer around them. after a while when this friend came out and everyone accepted it, it took a few years and a lot of thinking and remembering to see the root of the problem until just around now, where i finally discovered the root of this and now i accpet myself for who i am. i still have trauma and a lot of my behavior is influenced by those things but i feel like myself now and i can finally start questioning those things without being afraid of others. i wish i wasnt a man.

you have great taste btw. and ongezellig is awesome. 

>I hate how everyone is born with the ability to do/make/achieve wonderful things- except for myself.
i can't do anything creative either. i've been trying to build and paint armies for miniature wargaming for years now and never finished a single one. my friends want to do it, so i go along, but i would have given up and sold that stuff years ago. i just can't keep myself motivated.

>now i accpet myself for who i am. i still have trauma and a lot of my behavior is influenced by those things but i feel like myself now and i can finally start questioning those things without being afraid of others.
i'm happy you've overcome that inner and outer struggle and that you now can accept yourself for who you are. your struggles probably aren't over, but you are on a good path. i wish you all the strength you need to become who you want to be and leave that trauma behind. 

>i wish i wasnt a man.
i've given that a lot of thought as well. i'm male. i don't have a problem with that, but i never were able to see myself as a "man" as society defines it. that was all the more apparent the more i failed at achieving what a man is supposed to achieve in his life. you talk about being "pansexual" or a "tranny", but these labels always felt so... dehumanizing to me. as if you were only allowed access to certain behaviors, mannerisms and feelings that are tied to these labels, instead of those being basic human behavior that is open to anyone. male, female or whatever. i never wanted to restrict myself in that way. sure, these things are useful to communicate your preferences to others, but that's about it. in the end i decided to be "nothing". just me. it was nice when i found the character "someone" from "shimanami tasogare". someone who was just able to be themself, no strings attached. made me feel less alone.

oh well, if it really is the same outcome, beating yourself up over it is even more pointless, isn't it? but if it gets results when you need, you do you. you've still got plenty of time to be a creatively unfulfilled dunce like me later. i checked out languageapps. i was pretty overwhelmed by the sheer amount and they all seem to be based on a monthly subscription, which i personally don't like, but whatever. thinking about how you might get more for your money, i thought about max miller. the guy has a show called tasting history, where he cooks historical recipes and gives a little insight on the period the dish is from. great show, love the guy, but what i also remembered was that he is sponsored by wondrium, a learning focussed streaming service with courses on a whole slew of topics. it has a german language course and probably something on drawing as well. there's a free trial and you can get discounts all over the place. mabye check that out?

Top Gear as we knew it ceased in 2015 when they decided not to renew Clarkson's contract. It continued after with new presenters but no one watched it. The three bumbling idiots have another show in a virtually identical format called "The Grand Tour" on Amazon. A lot higher budget and it's a fun watch ^_^

>based on a monthly subscription
Most of them are now, yes, since they try to treat it as a service to learn a language. All of them are cut-paste the same thing as the next, equally as ineffective. I'd consider a subscription, but I cannot learn well with a video alone, I tried that with French and it went in one ear out the other as normal. 

>if it really is the same outcome, beating yourself up over it is even more pointless, isn't it?
Of course, since there is no way to reroute the strings of neurons in my mind to allow me to show some progress. My mind has been static for years, and any time I get the urge to make something I nearly cry because I cannot. It's gotten to the point that I'm beginning to loathe those born with the ability to learn. Have you known of a single master artist, animator, or cartoonist who didn't learn early in life by the grace of God? I know not. My only option is art uni, which is gatekept as despite being where you're supposed to learn, they expect you to go into it knowing how to BE A FUCKING MASTER ALREADY. This is hopeless. I may as well go back to being a hiki and rot away as miserably as possible

i'm watching the grand tour and clarkson's farm as well. where else can i find people stup... i mean, brave enough to play chicken with a wall. top tier tv entertainment. a friend of mine told that clarkson got himself canceled again? hope not...

>but I cannot learn well with a video alone
same. theoretical knowledge and the application of that knowledge are completely different skillsets and knowing one doesn't automatically translate to being good at the other. i need to be shown and to be allowed to learn hands on. i have no patience for the theory anymore.

>since there is no way to reroute the strings of neurons in my mind to allow me to show some progress
that's not entirely true, i think. synapses strengthen (decision in favor of something) and weaken (decision against something) all the time, but you need new information to change a behavior. you can't act on knowledge you don't have. that's why i was suggesting to search for other techniques. you might just be missing that crucial piece of information. 

>It's gotten to the point that I'm beginning to loathe those born with the ability to learn. 
some people might be born with it, but i think the ability to learn is mostly nurtured early or aquired through hard work. a lot of naturally smart and talented people struggle later in life, because they never needed to build up the patience to learn or to put in the work. 

>which is gatekept as despite being where you're supposed to learn, they expect you to go into it knowing how to BE A FUCKING MASTER ALREADY.
they need you to know, because they can't teach you anymore. the masters are gone. i read this quote from a guy who was searching for animators for the studio he wanted to build. long story short: he couldn't find any. most of the students didn't want to put in the work and the teachers, after being pressed, admited they didn't know how to teach what was needed. the knowledge is gone. i'll look it up.

They tried to over some comments he made about Meghan Markle, a person the British people already do not like. Needless to say, not too much came from it other than a load of whining and false inferences that his show would be cancelled.

Because there are no means for me to gain said knowledge in the first place.
>they need you to know, because they can't teach you anymore...they didn't know how to teach what was needed.
Then how is this knowledge passed on, how do people "learn" to do it in the first place? Why can a random sixteen year old girl who failed all of her courses learn to draw things wonderfully, yet no one else can? There has to be some kind of conspiracy going on, to prevent those deemed not worthy for whatever reason from learning how to make themselves happy (or I'm just deluded, but it does feel that way often).

I've been obsessed about this for going on six years, and I don't think it will end pretty (I really love the drawing I embedded, but even with that I begin to feel envious and spiteful)

Tonight was really bad. they spoke to me about the cutting but they said they would stop being friends with me if i didnt stop. I want to kill myself so badly they told me to stop telling them everytime im suicidal because they are sick of hearing it. I wish things were different, they keep sending photos and videos of me no matter how many times i tell them to stop

it's on wednesday. I just...haven't talked about it irl ever, and once my antidepressants started masking those feelings I figured, well maybe I'll just take them forever and not worry about it any more. but that's no longer working so...

(and yeah that video is unironically my thing haha)

I have no experience with psychiatrist but can't you just tell them that? 
>I've been thinking about this for a while and I suspect I might be trans 
Good luck

>>72975142
these people sounds terrible, expecting you to get better without offering any support 
I think they will only make your mental state worse
I know it's not easy but maybe you should find some new ones


Okay, imma continue my trip

>>I've been thinking about this for a while and I suspect I might be trans
yeah I'll probably go with something like that. just, putting it down in text where I have time to think about it is one thing, actually talking about it is just kinda daunting. but I know I need to do it eventually. thank you for the well wishes, I hope your trip is nice and enjoyable.

Hi from /biz/ and /tg/. 
Don't cut yourselves please.
Trust me, despair and loneliness can be far more intense than you expect, as anyone from my boards will attest.
Harming your vessel is not going to cure anything, it will simply make you feel like you're doing SOMETHING, which is what your brain needs.
Try literally anything else, please.
I almost lost myself to this 20 years ago, and I just lost someone 2 weeks ago to the same hazard.
You will be missed, but you cannot come back.
Please stay with us.
Don't touch the grass, just absorb the same sunlight that the grass does.
Look at the sky, even on cloudy days.
There is so much out there, if you have the spark to go look for it.
I love you. 
Please survive.

is there a way you can avoid the checkup?
also do they check your wrist as a part of the checkup?

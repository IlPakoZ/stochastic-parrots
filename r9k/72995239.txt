Sage. This is the JBK chinkers posting.
--- 72995279
Korean women can be pretty with makeup and surgery. But they have the worst personalities of all Asian women. 
They are extremely materialistic. They cant take responsibility for anything. You know how people say western women are like spoiled whiny children who never take accountability? Korean women are like, on steroids. They are loud. They tend to drink a lot. They can be psychotic and violent. And they talk shit about Korean men while riding the Chad Kim cock carousel. I would pump and dump a Korean girl but never marry one, after my experiences.

I love Korea and the Korean people but I'd never want to be Korean myself. They suffer. I'd rather be an outsider that enjoys cool Korean stuff without any of the pressure or responsibility. This applies to Asians in general for me. It's better to visit than live there.

Not a girl, schizo. I was stationed in Korea for 2 years. Korean girls are crazy. Bet you havent even lived there. Typical burger.
--- 72995431
>>72995279

can confirm. I've met and talked to many korean women, I can confirm i've only found one to be pleasant to hang with. Female gooks are pieces of shit, and i'm honestly thankful their race is dying out (south korea has a birthrate crisis, where they broke the world record which they used to already hold)

You never even went to Korea. You have never interacted with real Korean women. You have no idea what you are talking about. Japanese girls are way better, personality wise.

>>72995239 (OP)
I wish I wasn't. Debunked.
>>72995279
Exactly. This is why even yellow fever autists go to Japan, Taiwan, or China, but not to Korea. At least white rosties have outgoing personalities or interesting hobbies. Korean women think that showing gratitude lowers their self-worth, but all they want to talk about is celebrity gossip or the drama they watched yesterday. If a Korean woman says she reads, you have to be especially careful because there is a 90%+ chance that the majority of the books she consumes are feminist gibberish. Asian women's shallowness and white women's shamelessness; that's Korean women. Of course, 0.7 fertility rate is not the fault of only one gender, but every foreigner I know who lives in Korea (3) is of the opinion that Korean women are far more to blame. I don't know what that tripfag and other JBK discord troons want, but the gender war is real.
--- 72995621
Korean girls are so fucking hot. It's like combining a japanese girl in an american girls body, they are DEFINATELY more voluptuous than other asians. FUCK YEA
--- 72995634

nope!

i went to the steam room + pool two times a week.

long swim sesh plus multiple visits to the steam room, plus cold showers.

do this for a month, bring lots of water.
--- 72995639
i only care about nyeongie
--- 72995641
I dont really care if im Korean. I don't think there was any significant disadvantages or advantages in my life from it. One good thing is going back every now and then and sight seeing old fortresses there.
--- 72995647

Huh? I dont think so. Their average breast cup size is AA. 
Some of the fatter ones get bigger tits. But generally the only big titty girls you see in Seoul are ones with implants. And they dont have ass either.
--- 72995664

you care about Chinese Chad.

tho i dont think Larry can speak more than two words in Mandarin, lel

--- 72995692

Asian women in general are especially guilty of this and materialism is also a feminine trait so expect it from all women in some capacity

Korean fortresses are quite the plain sight unless you can understand the design principles. Regardless i recommend Suwon Hwaseong. It is faithfully reconstructed and easy to walk on. (most fortresses are 5km long). There are also decent restaurants insides. Namhansanseong has the damnable prestige of being the last shelter of the King of Joseon and has quite the pretty sight. But it is far off in the rural regions. There's quite a lot to do in seoul non historically you just have to search it up. Even just walking around the tourist areas like the old palace or Hongdae i find fun.

>Dajeon
Im afraid i've never had the pleasure of staying there so i can't say much if he wants to go there.
--- 72996007
i must learn from nyeongies buddha-like compassion 
i must stop calling black twitter stans n*ggers when they aggravate me

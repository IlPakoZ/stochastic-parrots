Young alcoholics, I envy you.

For those of you who have been an alchy but dealt with it; what helped? Did you ever go to AA or anything? I'm kind of thinking about going, mostly to find other alcoholics to be friends with.

Weed, working out, only drinking before bed so you can sleep
--- 73105042
out of beers currently, should go and buy a new pack of 20, though I might go drinking with some friends later anyways and might not have to
--- 73105056
well i hope you get the help you need soon. im only 18 but i already hate this. thanks 4 the thread

>>73105056
You have nice taste, OP. That was a very cute post.
 It took me until my early 30s to become a full blown alcoholic, but I first got drunk at 18. Would get blackout drunk on occasion throughout my 20s by myself, now I just get drunk as a part of life. It's not pleasant but neither is being alive. 

>>73105026
I smoke weed too, it's much gentler and generally safer, but booze makes me feel on top of the world before I crash.

been to rehab and done the AA shtick. a problem i had was that beyond my addiction i had little in common with those people. people my age were addicted to every drug there is and other alchies were at least 35 and had ex wives and kids they never got to see. 
its a disease for sure. no matter how long i stay sober the reason i drink never goes away. my life sucks and when i start drinking i feel like i'm finally happy. 
its a soulcrushing cycle.

>end up doing something dumb while drunk

>life is fuck...
so dunno what to tell you. i've blown a fuckload of money lying in my room drinking. i HAVE to stay sober now. everyone in my family and a lot of other people know i'm an alchie now. my drivers license got revoked by my doctor because i drank so much that being sober would put me in the same boat as an epileptic so i need to take monthly blood tests that measure how much i drank that month and i still feel like throwing away what little i have left to get drunk again.

Fuck, that's a really good description. It's a constant cycle that has felt shorter and shorter to me

>okay just six drinks

>well okay you did all that but just try not to be so reckless tomorrow
>next day: repeat 
>>73105334
I've only had sake once; it was the best thing I could get at the grocery store. It was okay, but goddamn was it way sweeter than I expected. Typically prefer dry, tart wines and drinks. I'm drinking my 8 percent sugar and booze bomb I planned to save for tomorrow afternoon, but fuck it, such is life.
--- 73105616
>>73105465
wishing you the best too, man, God willing you'll stay safe too.
--- 73105652
>>73105499
yep.
i got my hands on a bunch of benzos so i'd have emergency hangover cure since the worst for me is the anxiety. bet your ass i ended up eating a bunch of them while drinking which served literally no purpose other than making me black out and stumble more. last time i sobered up i found one left in the blister while cleaning my room and despite tasting like it should it did fuckall to curb my anxiety, i got my tolerance through the roof while i was too fucked to gain anything anyway.
 tried a bunch of other drugs too in an attempt to curb my drinking just a little but i use them all for the same purpose, numbing myself to the point where i can pass out peacefully, often along with alcohol anyway.
and each time i fall on the bottle i sink lower than i did last time.
--- 73105780
>>73105652
Fuck, can relate to that. I love benzos. They're like little minidrunks in pill form without the hangover. 

It's hard to explain to people who don't experience that sort of relief from booze or benzos, but fuck, it's like a totally different world than sobriety. You know you'll crash at the end, but the rollercoaster high at its peak is so liberating.
--- 73106008
>>73105780
yeah and seeing the madness i feel like i've been on a high horse about people in abusive relationships. it seems so ridiculous to me but drinking your life away seems just as stupid to most normal people so i guess i cant judge.
not sure if its encouraging or disheartening how many celebrities also struggled with pills and alcohol. matthew perry and charlie sheen for example ended up blowing their life and careers being addicts and those guys were pretty much set, shouldn't have had any reason to do that shit. they also ended up going back and forth being sober and using just like any other addict, no amount of money can buy sobriety.
i'm not rich like that tho. i can quit now and live a relatively normal life but if i continue my life is going straight in the shitter, like crazy village drunk tier.

Thinking of becoming an alcoholic to drown it all out. Why the fuck am I like this anons?
--- 73106059
>>73106035
sounds like either OCD or the tism.
have you considered therapy? you dont have to be dead honest about everything but it might help you deal with some of that
--- 73106063
>>73105016 (OP)

I traded my severe dependence for alcohol in for a severe dependence for weed.

When I get drunk I do stupid suicidal shit and end up in jail or the hospital. When I smoke weed I end up in my comfy gamer chair playing gmod.

So obviously I see this as an absolute win.
--- 73106069
>>73106035
alcohol will help until it doesn't. figuring that shit out soberly is better. i speak from experience.
--- 73106081
>>73106059
I should. I really should, and I know it. But I am deathly, deathly afraid of being locked up in a psych ward, and I have this horrible habit of being completely truthful whenever people ask questions. I can't help but answer.
>>73106069
You're right as well, I know. I just feel like this is so hard. But I guess that's why most people become alcoholics in the first place, and it never seems to be a good thing.
--- 73106087
>>73106063
weed is illegal as hell in my country and around here people see it as a drug just like speed or heroin. 
fucking sucks man. i'd get stoned if i could but if i get caught its fucking jail, police searching my place, random piss tests and being unemployable.
--- 73106100
>>73106035

As someone who drank themselves into a hospital or jail cell weekly, before finally getting my shit together and going to therapy, let me just say that you should just do the therapy option

Jail sucks, and if you go to the hospital enough they'll commit you for a month or two. Alcohol is a destructive band-aid that wears after a day, therapy is the cure.
--- 73106114
>>73106081
dealing with your shit is way easier if you dont have alcoholism on there as well.
they wont lock you up unless you are clearly psychotic or talk about harming others or yourself.
--- 73106125
>>73106100
how did you get thrown in jail and hospital all the time?
how has this affected your current life?
--- 73106137
>>73106081

I've been in the hospitals psyche ward many, many times so I can actually give you some insight here.

Psyche wards cost money. The only time they will put you in a psyche ward is if you are a danger to yourself, or others.

Unless you are about to kill yourself, somebody else, or have committed a crime and have been court mandated to one, you will not be forcefully put into a psyche ward. 

That kind of shit only happens in looney tunes, and if anyone tells you otherwise they are a troll, and they are lying to you.

Therapy works. I'm not only an advocate of it, I am a very satisfied customer.
--- 73106139
>>73106035
Op here; that's pure OCD. I have it too. Unless you have it, the weird rituals will never make sense. You must satisfy the rituals to put your brain back into neutral, as I've experienced it. Things that don't make sense logically must be satisfied ritually to calm the mind. 
>>73106008
I get that; I don't think suffering really only applies to one class of people, as jelly as I am of the wealthy. Sure, the rich have it way better, but being a human and existing in this goddamned world is an inherent struggle against everything else as your body slowly decomposes, weakens, and eventually dies. I genuinely believe this material realm is "hell", it's just that hell isn't some pit of fire and endless torture. It's a quiet, somber painful world where the flaws of everything and yourself emerge and smother you over time, keeping just a teensy bit of hope alive long enough to intensify your desperation.

Btw, Tiger Blood Charlie is truly an icon, I don't care how many buttholes he fucked up while on coke and slanging HIV. 

Yeah, I don't know where I'm headed now, but I can tell it's dark and awful, but it still seems only mildly worse than the dull end I'm approaching otherwise.

Alcoholic anons, you're good people. Like, really good people.
>>73106139
You think it's OCD? Thing is, it's like...I know that logically it makes no sense, that the two actions simply cannot be linked. But at the same time I know for a fact that if I don't do it the bad thing will happen. Even when I have resisted and the time for the bad even has passed, and I've proven that it was false, it just redoubles my beliefs because that means the next time will definitely happen, or be worse, or both. Is that how you'd describe OCD?

So to make a long story short, I lived my whole life with some pretty severe mental illnesses. Instead of addressing those problems I would drink, and when I drink my mental illnesses really peak, which would lead to me doing dangerous self destructive things.

Things like jumping in front of a truck on the highway to try and kill myself (I pussied out at the last minute) burning an abandoned house down. Stealing alcohol from many, many stores, smoking crack (didn't put my in jail on it's own but didn't help) ODing on Xanex and face-planting on a street, and much more.

I've been in, and out of jail and the hospital many many times for these antics, and I wound up homeless because my mom was too afraid of finding me dead in her house one day to let me live there.

Once homeless I eventually made my way into a halfway house fresh out of the hospital, where I was mandated to go to intensive therapy.

At first I didn't t take the therapy seriously, kept drinking and smoking crack, and almost got kicked out multiple times, but after a while I started to actually take the shit seriously.

The meds helped a lot, they helped me see things a lot more clearly, and I eventually started really taking the help I was getting seriously, and address my many issues.

Today I live in an apartment by myself. I support myself with a state job, and I've really grown as a person.

I want to act as a warning to other people, so that they don't make the same mistakes I did, and have to go through the same terrible things I've done.

I also feel like I need to atone for the horrible things I've done when I was sick, and if I can convince others to not go down the road I did, I feel like that's a good start.

>been drinking since I turned 21
>sip all my shots
>stay hydrated and piss before bed, avoid caffeine 

I'm 35 and no issues so far but some days I don't even drink. I think my issue is I'm around binge drinkers and people trying to challenge me. I need to stop rising to the occasion and let these hoes slump. All my bad nights have been because some asshole challenged me to a drink off

I notice that at my local liquor store I am the only awkward custie feels bad man. I try to be friendly but I always stumble over my words or do something awkward. I like the butch lesbian cashier she always makes me feel at ease she saw me buying rawhides for my dogs and was like gotta treat the puppies right and I chuckled and agreed. She's nice. The foreigner cashiers are really loud and friendly and half the time I don't understand their accent. When I see other customers get greeted and have familiar banter with the cashiers I get jealous of their social skills. I am on my second liquor store I rotated to this one cuz at my old one the guy got too friendly and was commenting on my weight and it made me mad

It sucks.I lost the genetic lottery on that one. It's not easy, but the meds I'm on really help with the symptoms and I get a good support network to help me when I get sick.

>For those of you who have been an alchy but dealt with it; what helped?
i wouldn't call myself a full blown alcoholic but i was excessively drinking for most of 2022, going through over half a bottle of liquor a night every weekend at least
i was losing interest in alcohol becasue the hangovers, blackouts and general sense of feeling shitty was getting to me
then i tried edibles.
alters the way you think, feel and percieve everything in a positive way without the hangovers, blackouts, general sense of feeling shitty etc. hell i feel better the day after doing edibles.
it wasn't a conscious decision to stop drinking, i just completely lost interest in it because whenever i thought about drinking or buying another bottle of booze i just decided i'd rather get high instead.

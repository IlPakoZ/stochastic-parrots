Watched a kid get hit by an elderly lady driving right through a red light outside the school. Dude missed a full year and when he came back he had full on concussion brain, much slower than his former self.

Some kid died from cancer and their class organised a huge memorial service with speeches, flowers, music, pictures all that stuff. It all seemed super heartfelt but some days later it turned out that most kids just used this event to get attention on social media

>be me
>grow up in rural midwest
>whole area is full of dirt poor families
>some doing the adoption hustle
>basically, they adopt kids to get state money
>kids come from bad homes, like so bad they are taken into protective custody
>go to school with these kids
>one day, hear gunshot during class
>one of the adopted kids killed herself in the bathroom
>turns out a bunch of the adopted kids were getting molested

The midwest can be a pretty sick place, people have no idea.

Two things I won't forget.
The morning where my sisters and I were almost at school and saw a girl maybe 7 years old get hit by a car right next to us as she crossed the road. She flipped so hard onto the windscreen that her shoe flew off down the street. The driver sat there in shock for what felt like several minutes until the girl slid off the car and started screaming. 
I didn't know what to do, being only 9 or so myself. My older sister kept trying to drag us to school, but I wanted to make sure that something was done. Once some adults showed up to handle it I was ok with moving on. An officer showed up later to talk to us about it, apparently she just had some severe bruising. 
 
The second thing I won't forget. Year 8 camp, so the age-group would have been about 11-13.
The first night at the campsite, most of the students were running around outside in the dark after we were supposed to be asleep. The teachers cabins were a reasonable distance away and none of them were patrolling or whatever.
Anyway, the next morning we had an assembly. The dean went absolutely ballistic. Apparently 23 students decided to have a massive orgy. And being a private catholic school, the teachers didn't know what the fuck to do about it. I never saw it reported anywhere, but I can't be the only one who went around telling people about it.

>COVID period, all classes were online through google meet
>inteclass suicide prevention presentation; every highschool student from my not very big school was watching the other students' presentations through google meet
>most people formed groups and used slideshows 
>one poor tard decided to record a video and to just screen share during the meeting
>he made the suicide prevention video on a "youtube commentary" format; like leafy used to do 
>it was supposed to have Rocket League playing in the background while he talked about suicide and how suicide was bad and stuff
>supposed to
>tard couldn't share audio
>my entire highschool watched rocket league gameplay for 2 minutes waiting for some sort of content to start
>tard doesn't realize no one can hear him until people start laughing in chat
>teacher doesn't even look pissed, just disappointed when she realizes what's happening 
>poor fucker failed the presentation that accounted for 40% of the grades of like 4 different subjects
>wasn't even particularly good rocket league gameplay

Ah, we had 3 students off themselves in the space of maybe 2 months. The amount of kids that (in my opinion) pretended to be 'close' to them and were too depressed over it to do classwork for weeks was infuriating. But maybe I'm just retarded and those 3 students were good friends with over 600 kids and I just never noticed.

Theorized ccr5-32 deletion since 2005. In my advances toward the opposite sex competitor males also theorized ways to advance evolution by several degrees using Krav Maga. Basically diabetics with access to arginine and casein whey would blackmail me for $10, $20 at a time and threaten that if I didn't do their bidding, they would do irreversible harm. Efforts to advance natural selection in our female cohorts resulted in a complete shed of sex drive after the head physics and astronomy teacher made the statement "If your friends jumped off a cliff, would you?". Thanklessly the women moved onto non-English speakers and left the country when Krav Maga added 32 basepairs to my DNA by cleaving my viral liposomes with a calcium phosphate contusion and simple RNA spread that rendered me devolved. There were undercover assignments in college to advance in the art department that were disassembled that also go uncredited.

Long story short, i shat in a bidet, and later i had to clean it almost with my bare hands, and there wasn't any water so i had to go to a distant faucet to wash my dirty hands ;__;

he was concussed a full year later? I don't know what the implications are of that. But it don't sound right. Concussions are short lived. I think you mean he had b rain damage. Not exactly power words there.... just, brain damage.

Your kind are weird

In elementary school there was this weird kid who always tried to pick fights with everyone and shat on the floor once. He eventually befriended some other kid and they seemed to get along quite well. But one day the weird kid threw his "friend" on the ground and held him down while another kid who was a known troublemaker kicked him in the head

Rural school.

Big fat kid sold an even bigger fatter kid's girl friend meth and got her addicted.

Bigger kid punched less big kid through a glass pane (we had these weird 12 ft tall window things that opened on the bottom, picrel isn't it, but the closest I could find). Both expelled on the spot.

Druggie town bike of the school ran a red light with some friends and got hit by a semi truck, 2 died in the hospital the other moved away. Everyone forgot the friend, but we had a big party for her after. (she would, like, want us to celebrate her life man not mourn her death) anyway I got drunk and fingered some friend of a friend for like 6 hours straight still the only sexual experience I've ever had.

We had a mcdonalds RIGHT across the street from our highschool but we weren't allowed off campus lunch because some supreme braindead faggot got hit crossing the street (there is a light and a crosswalk). Then he got hit AGAIN, the same kid got hit twice. So they banned off campus lunch for fucking everybody. I hope that kid got hit by a third car to finish him off

one time a kid jumped off the playground and landed on a seagull that was flying through and broke its wings
it was going fucking ballistic and he was scared as fuck so he ran after it, grabbed it by its legs and slammed it into the concrete so itd be quiet and no teachers would come

oh and in high school we had this cripple kid in an electronic wheelchair and like this metal head brace and he went down a ramp wrong and tipped his wheelchair scooter thing and an ambulance came and we didnt see him ever again

Similar thing happened to me in highschool as well. We had a bunch of grocery shops and a McDonald's right next to the school, so during lunch break a lot of us would just go there. Technically we weren't allowed to leave but literally no one cared. It was completely unenforced. But THEN, some retarded freshnigger got drunk as shit during the lunch break outside of the school, teachers went ballistic and since then this rule started being actually enforced. Those caught leaving the school during the school hours were heavily repressed from that point on (some guy even got expelled I heard). Fuck this bitch (the freshnigger) honestly, hope she dies from alcohol poisoning.

In my senior year two two football players went to a party and recorded themselves fucking a drunk freshie. They both got charges iirc.
--- 73063246
Also I heard in elementary school some kid got angry and ran around pissing on people. Later he got angry about the art room being remodeled and threw shot at the window in retaliation.

one day in 4th grade a girl shit herself
she tried to hide it but when she stood up a little nugget fell out of her pants leg
the class clown noticed and loudly shrieked that she pooped
everyone including the teacher laughed until the teacher realized she was causing permanent emotional harm to the kid
when i was in community college an obese women fell and couldnt get up. me and a lot of guys tried to help her but she was so big and so weak that we couldnt. as time wore on she started getting more and more humiliated the look in her eyes was like an animal's. someone said to give her privacy and we hauled ass outta there. the look of pain on her face still affects me when i think about it

What are "jumper cables"?

you poke someone in the sides while standing behind them, usually after sneaking up on them. it's borderline sexual harassment in this case

How do you flirt with girls?
--- 73002893
>>73002853
Step one is having confidence. After that it's mostly a combination of very light teasing and passive compliments. 
I'll say though usually flirting is less of a step by step process and rather is a mutual vibe that two people have. It's like this kinetic energy where you and the girl are clearly trying your hardest to make each other smile.

Tell them that theyre really pretty all the time. Women also like when you are straight forward. If you only want sex, tell her. Girls also like when you send memes all the time. Send her a lot of memes

I only once had this with a girl. It was on a first year college party, but later some friends came look for me because the friend group was in another part of the campus and I leave her. We never flirted again.

I remember I said something like "oh yeah, that movie is so cute" and she replied something like "you are cute", and then I tried to came up with something like "no more than you". It was really weird, and I didn't know how to continue the interaction.

You are 100% correct. This guy fucks or at least gets a lot of attention from women.

this

hoenstly when girls show me signs or flirt with me when im not expecting it i get caught off guard, dont know what to do (since i already have a gf and dont know these girls so dont trust them) and wind up acting awkward or intentionally fumbling the bag

in hindsight i doged a bunch of drama and stds for a simple sex life

I did this. I even had her go in the bathroom and rub her pussy while friend were at her house. She was ridiculously into it to lol.

>>73002893
The moment I walk into the room, all smiles are gone and they dont want to even try to make me smile. At that point, why bother?

All of this only works if you're atleast decently attractive. Seem some chad friends do all of this before, works like a charm.

If you're average, it can work, and its where try and error ensues.

If you're ugly, much like myself, save yourself from the humiliation. Trust me. Sometimes is better to stay in the shadows.

Based Chad.
This probably happens with music groups as well, no? Funny is the fact that R*dditors shill men to join groups, but the moment one wants to date one of the girls -- especially the pretty one -- shit gets wild and the group dissolves in less than a month.
--- 73008399
this makes me hate chads even more, i can understand if its sorority girls BUT NERDY VIRGIN GIRLS!! leave them alone!!!!

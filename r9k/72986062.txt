What's your relationship with your mother like?
Are you two solid like diamonds?

We have a healthy relationship, though rarely she gets in a bad mood and refuses to explain shit without being passive/aggresive.

Do you guys hug and kiss everyday?

It's fine. She's always been overprotective of me but she means well.

I love my mom, she's very level-headed and not a jackass and respects my decisions while still being involved in my life

We argue all the time. few days ago I got really mad at her and slapped her in the face. it was wrong but she deserved it.

She is extremely low iq and loses her cool all the time. Not much different from me cause I have inflicted violence on her. I regret it a lot though.

she died last year from cancer don't have much left keeping me here now

I love her, but she's not the level headed one in the family. She teaches elementary, so often ends up treating me and my sister like babies. 
It gets really annoying when she does it, but if we express our annoyance too much, then she gets depressed and my dad gets angry at us.
As a kid, my sister was my dad's favorite, but I didn't really like my mom since we didn't have many overlapping interests.

We got along up until a year ago. My mother seems... Dead inside. Couldn't tell you why, and it's certainly not from me. Both of my brothers are doing well financially and in their personal lives, I'm headed toward a career as a lawyer. She just hasn't been talking to anyone she used to, including my aunt who she used to be extremely close with. Only contact she has with the outside world nowadays is with my brother and his kids.

Dont regret it king she probably deserved it. Seriously when a f*id gets beaten she most likely did something to deserve it lmao

id argue no one here really has a healthy relationship with their parents. you might love your mom and would do anything for her but that doesnt mean your relationship is healthy. as for mine well she is bpd and denying treatment.
--- 72986761
She's a dumb, implulsive and annoying person you can't argue with like with a rational human being, although she fullfils her basic motherly obligations i'll give her that. For that reason, i grew up to be pretty apathetic to her but im one of those momcest freaks that saw some sort of success and i'm in it just for a hookup now. Interesting turn of events.

Is the urge to kill people a legitimate reason to join the army?

Sure why not. Either you get to kill people *legally* for your country or get killed in action, which is also good considering you're a potential threat to society.
Looks like a win-win scenario baby.

Yeah but don't tell them that. Say you need the money or the GI bill or whatever.
Soldiers are no different than mercenaries except they get worse pay.

I doubt you'd pass basic but if you did you'd probably outgrow this phase

To add to that, you probably won't get a chance to kill anyone regardless unless it's friendly fire. You could serve for a while and get specialized training so you can get hired by a pmc later. You really have to know your shit though because pmcs are starved for bodies.

>The city of Rome was in chaos after the devastating loss at the Battle of Carthage. Shinji felt a knot forming in his stomach as he walked through the streets, knowing that his father, Gendo, was waiting for him at home with some news. When he arrived, Gendo told him that he was getting drafted into the legions to fight in the next battle. Shinji felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as he imagined himself in battle.
>Asuka, Shinji's fiery and impulsive wife, was already waiting for him in their chambers. When she heard the news, she immediately began to berate him.
>"You're afraid, Shinji," she said, her voice dripping with scorn. "You're a coward who can't even face the fact that he's going to have to fight. What kind of man are you?"
>Shinji winced at her words, feeling the familiar shame and humiliation welling up inside him. He knew that he wasn't brave, that he wasn't strong, that he wasn't like the other men in Rome. He was just a passive beta who tended to apologize a lot.
>Asuka wasn't finished yet, though. "I bet you're just Kaworu's little catamite, aren't you?" she sneered. "Taking it like a woman, always on your back with your legs spread wide."
>Shinji felt his face burn with shame and anger at her words. He knew that Kaworu, a powerful Roman general, was Asuka's lover, but he had never thought that she would stoop so low as to use that against him.
>"Stop it, Asuka," he said, his voice shaking with emotion. "Please stop."
>But Asuka wasn't going to let up. "No, Shinji," she said, advancing on him with a cruel smile. "I won't stop until you stop being such a pathetic little worm. You're going to man up, Shinji, whether you like it or not. You're going to fight in that battle, and you're going to make me proud."
>Shinji felt trapped and helpless, unable to resist Asuka's bullying and manipulation. He knew that he had to do as she said, no matter how much it hurt him.

>I moved in one summer that only had a single flooding incident in the parking lot. Thankfully that day I had chanced class at the local community being in session and my low riding vehicle escaped any stillwater damage to the exhaust system. I narrowly escaped piercing my tire with the rebar poking out of the pothole that violently presented itself each time I needed trips to the store. Even before the flood but possibly after the Greater Flood Encompassing Lesser Houston of 2016 that was over 5 years ago, I suspect damage to the hall lighting created an electrical meltdown to the building that left the residents in total darkness after the hours of 6pm on average.

>I jumbled through my keys every night catching glimmers of lunar light in my flathead hand-screwdriver as I tried desperately to escape the sounds of people living their lives at-will inside the walls and behind the doors. I kept a painter's fiber tape with my address written in black pen fastened to my front door for any Amazon delivery to the third floor that was addressed to me to receive. After 2 weeks, I exercised my tenant rights to fix whatever maintenance related problem usurped my intelligence by physically inspecting the attic where the breaker for the building was kept. Once I shut it down so I could begin tracing what wires needed replacing so I could fix my side of the hallway, a was smeared by the slimy encasing of a hive of interdimensional beings stowed away somewhere in the attic. They told me their home planet that was conquered by their race called them Wasp Roaches, and as soon as I tried to draw my katana the leader of them drew a firearm and explained to me this: That they were going to be living here, their hive planet demanded sexual libel, and that they were going to take whatever they wanted. Most of their criminal stimulation came from Tucker Carlson advertisements. After a week of being held-hostage with the freedom to shop for sodas "for the boys", because the box ran out of battery and the TV couldn't be turned off-- I was pistol whipped and shouted at for minutes in a language I didn't understand, but it sounded like Hebrew.

>He shouted foremost that I shouldn't have "reserved life" in their hive before rubbing a piece of pizza in my face and forcing me to the ground. Other Hornet Roach appeared from beneath tubs, the panels of doors, and an opening from the back porch and they entertained themselves with a strategy game I designed in my college years called Mockery Game of Midwits; that was a rape-central participation game and fixed to evicting unwilling victims from the board by removal of pieces--- which meant that whichever Hornet Roach felt victimized the player best, got to stay in the apartment while another roach escorted me to the store to buy blood thinners and potatoes that they fed me each evening when the sleep deprivation got so bad I could no longer see my aggressors. In July after daily exercises of MGOM there was a day they released me to the lower levels of the building to flag down Non-Dwelling Inhabitants and I got the idea to employ my Alien Tape to create a distress call with a slice of pizza taped to the dumpster. Something about this seemed right and they shortly received a call that the mothership would be "compressing" their colony to a 6-inch rocket to be carried off by the Bionuclear Department of Reality mixed with Entertainment and that they would be leaving me to die chained to the exposed air conditioning unit in the bathroom that began to flood, ruining the floorcakes I left unable to reach the toilet proper. But I noticed something as they exited and I could feel nothing but freedom as their universal presence was somehow shifted for the first time. A hole above the staircase caught the limb of the head roach, among an uncountable amount of minor mutants, and he tumbled down the staircase before a high-impact collision with the platform beneath that flight burst his form into slivers of Terrestrial light that illuminated my side of the hallway just for a night. My Asian girlfriend working abroad returned to me and cured the toxic levels of radiation

What is this? Some kind of made-up story? Did you post in the wrong thread?

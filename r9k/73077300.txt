I'm 33 and I'm really obsessed with the idea of getting a gf whos 18 and still in high school. It's like a massive fetish for me but it's probably impossible to achieve and even if I did everyone I know irl would hate me for it massively.

I am also 33

Is this the thread for the 33 years olders?

it's not a fetish you're just a normal heterosexual male

I'm 27 and an 18 y/o highschooler is hitting on me lol. I asked her out on a date

I had an 18 year old gf back when I was 28. It was a nice relationship. Older guy younger girl just works.
--- 73077994
I met my wife of 7 years when she was 17 and I was 28. I purposely dated young because:

A) I only date virgins
B) If I'm going to spend my life together with someone, I might as well experience her "best" years.

That said, the fact that you frame this as a "fetish" is concerning. Girls that age are very susceptible to manipulation. If your intention is just to fuck them, I think you should pass. But if you're looking to love and cherish a young girl and treat her right, that's fine.

Not only that, dating a girl that young means potentially fucking a virgin, meaning you ruin her for her future husband. If all men did this, none of us would ever get a virgin life partner, which most men want.

I'm 18 and dating a 28 yo guy from here. It's possible, but he's the kindest person ever, so, if you're not, then idk

I'm in my 40s and I'm currently grooming a virgin 17 year old to become my wife as soon as she turns 18. (16 is legal in this state.) 

I expect to lose all my friends over it when it becomes public, because they will be seething with jealousy over the age gap, but I won't care. I'll have a virgin wife.

I've been using 4chan since 2005. You leave.
--- 73078410
>>73078360
so have i, but im still a virgin, unlike your normie sex having love having ass

you cannot relate to our pains. you contibute to the cancer of this board

and you have no shame about it too. how hoes your join date indicate if you ought or ought not be here?

you are genuine normie cancer, and i hope a hell exists for you. if words have any meaning at all, i wish it was the case

>you cannot relate to our pains. you contibute to the cancer of this board
Sure I can. I was a NEET for 3 years. Also this board wasn't always this way. When r9k was created it was MEANT for original discussions. First it devolved into /soc/ before /soc/ was created. Now it's devolved into an incel venting forum. But that doesn't mean it has to be this way. There should be more posters like me and less like you, so that the board can be actually interesting again.

>you have no shame about it too. 
Why would I have shame for achieving things in life?

>you are genuine normie cancer, and i hope a hell exists for you.
I see. So being happy is some kind of sin to you? You wish pain upon others, because you experience pain yourself, and you think you're the moral one? A moral person would want others not to experience the pain they feel.

You could get a gold digger if you got the money.
Obviously more of a transaction than a real relationship.

its incredible how relevant memes made a decade ago are. you never were a robot. and r9k was brought back from deletion as a incel containment board, moot literally said this

you never were a robot, you genuinely dont belong here

>Why would I have shame for achieving things in life?
you ought be ashamed on being here because you have sex and love. thats what you ought be ashamed of

its like going up to homeless kids with your loving mother and father and giving them a big hug and lauhging. you are honestly a shameless disgusting piece of human trash, like all neurotypicals

>A moral person would want others not to experience the pain they feel.
stfu, dont talk to me about morals you fucking retard, i bet you eat meat too. you dont care about any of that shit

Ok. Make me leave then. Oh, you can't. I guess you're just stuck with me then.

I'm 33 as well but have actually had quite a few love interests around the 18 mark, granted they were all online. Tiktok seems like a great place to meet young girls if you're halfway attractive. Just use a selfie as your pfp and follow a bunch of young rando girls, the algo will recognize you like that and show you tons and tons more, and a lot of the time they'll follow you back and you can DM them.

God I wish I was attractive enough to fuck my 18 year old coworker
--- 73078831
>>73078533
lol

how pathetic do you have to be to argue against me. you have no arguments. the fact that you dont own being a piece of shit despicable normie shows just show spineless and pathetic of a human being you are
--- 73078916
>>73078831
You need to posit something for someone to have a counter argument. 

You're not really arguing anything. You're just whining. And no one cares.

Ayo man imma be real witchu how u gonna use reddit spacing and then hollar about how u been on here since 05 that don't make no sense brah
--- 73079957

Reddit spacing is literally a meme to detect newfags but ok
--- 73079983
>>73077300 (OP)
It's not hard at all, many young girls prefer older guys.

The issue here, of course, is that you are a loser and don't offer them anything, so you will never get one.

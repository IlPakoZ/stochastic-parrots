schizo but I don't want to talk to other schizos because I'm 80% of the way normal after 2 decades of working really hard and taking meds.

I am cursed with an absolute cocktail :
Autism, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, General Anxiety, Major Depression (now treated thankfully), Addictive Personality, HPPD, Anorexia and PDA. Fml. Somehow Im still alive and thriving better by the years.

I think I just have BPD, maybe ADHD since I can usually barely think straight and can't focus on anything.

OCD, bipolar, and schizophrenia. At least my prescriptions are free and I get disability bucks. I'm the oldest kid though and it's one of those things that doesn't always show up until a certain age so all my siblings are worried they have schizophrenia too. OCD was obvious since I was a kid and bipolar 100% came from mom because she very obviously has it

Depression with psychotic symptoms, doctor says I might be at a very early stage of schizophrenia.

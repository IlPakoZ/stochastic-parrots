I placed the pill under my tongue 20 hours ago. 
Within 5 minutes I felt elated. I could barely contain my grin. An hour prior I just felt numb and was only going through the motions of my day.
I stayed up late browsing /lgbt/ until 3am. 
Today I woke up feeling empty. I spent a lot of time hugging my pillow in a leg lock. I don't know how I will be able to handle being touch starved on E. 
My heart is racing. It speeds up and slows down a lot. I dont know if I want to be this emotional.

The cure for dysphoria isn't estrogen it's a noose, you will never have toe X chromosomes.

Well at least I'm feeling better. I was closer to the noose 24 hours ago than right now.

That's nice, OP. Sounds like you're happy you actually went through with it.

You sound sweet OP. Something tells me if you keep improving yourself like this you'll end up with someone who you deserve.

I don't mind HRT but please don't call yourself a girl in public. Be a pretty boy and dress however you want but don't force others to treat you like something you aren't.

Bruv, those feelings you are feeling are quite literally part of the short-term effects of hrt. You do what you want to do. I am not opposed to transition, but I am opposed to the standards being implemented for treating dysphoria in the modern day. The education is lax, and the requirements become more and more lax to the point that many people who are not really trans are ruining their lives by transitioning. You need to seriously be aware of what you are doing. The euphoric feelings and shit are not a result of the hormones working against dysphoria. The euphoria you feel currently is a result of the drug. The crash you feel is also a result of the drug. Just like any other high. 
As you continue to take it and your body adapts, both will fade and your mood stabalizes again. If your dysphoria is related to body image alone, you will have serious problems when your body doesn't turn out how you think it should. This is why the suicide rate tends to maintain and sometimes increase a few years after transition. 
Take the time to think about what you're actually doing before you possibly do irreparable harm to your body. I'm only saying this because you don't seem to be properly informed as to how estrogen increase even works in males, so make super super super sure you are educated on this shit before too long, so you can stop in time if you realize it won't solve your issues. Because the alternative to that work is far worse than your dysphoria pre-transition. I have had more than a few friends who ruined their bodies and their lives because the medical establishment did not put them through enough testing, enough therapy, and enough education for them to actually know if they were trans or not.
Good luck, Anon. I root for you.

It doesn't work that way. It's all or nothing. Do, or do not. There is no halfway.

Too tall either way. I would attempt to futamaxx and just be a gigantic woman. I have a beautiful face thankfully. It's just not going to happen for me.

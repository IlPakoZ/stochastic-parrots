People might complain about the Korean spam but at least its less pathetic than the bbc spam. The subject of the threads might change but not the people making them.

Not really. People just told bbc shitposters to fuck off because most of them were trolls and it doesn't really happen in real life.
Whites get heated at Korean posting because Koreans/white girls DOES overwhelmingly happen in real life and they can't just shitpost them away.

Saying girls can just "have sex" whenever they want misses the point. Girls, by and large, don't want casual sex. It doesn't make sense biologically. Women, for all of human history/prehistory, relied on a man (or many men) to provide for her and her offspring. Furthermore, women are the limiting factor in reproduction. A man could feasibly have thousands of children, but a woman could realistically only have a dozen or so. So it makes sense to seek the very best mate, not fuck a bunch of different dudes. 

To a woman, the ideal is a 10/10 looking hyper-competent billionaire who has eyes only for her. (I'm of course generalizing. I could say men like young girls with big tits but there are some who don't even like women). This is, of course, unrealistic, so she has to settle. Just like a man will have to settle for a woman who isn't a 10/10 and shares all his interests or whatever.

So to complain about women being able to just "have sex" is like saying that a lonely incel who desperately wants a girlfriend that he isn't really an incel because he could pay $80 to the local STD ridden crackwhore for sex.

Here's a study college aged volunteers approached the other gender and asked for casual sex to see if they would agree.

The women had a 75% success rate, the men had 0%

Also this study has been reproduced many times, and even some youtube videos have tried it out:

>Girls, by and large, don't want casual sex
cope. they do, just not with you. not with most men

they want it fast, hard, and often with men they find attractive

>It doesn't make sense biologically
sure it does. they want superior genes, and we live in a society where its easy for offspring to live through infnacy, even with single motherhood

well, you are wrong because woman can easily have sex. but they dont because they are chadsexuals

and girls do want casual sex. females have more sex than men, all with the same small % of men

If they fucking the whole gang it's pretty fucking casual. I only got close to 1 whore and I saw my friends taking turns on fucking her every single fucking week. Does that sound fucking casual enough for you? 70 men bodycount and each week a different dick. They be riding the car aswell, car blowjobs. You fucking prick

The guy is SUPER attractive. Can't pull a single girl. 

All fuckboys know this intrinsically. You need to dangle the possibility of a relationship to get sex.

Yes they do. How do you think they rack up double and triple digit body counts?
They love sleeping around, just with only 20% of the population

and yet famous musicians, drug dealers, sports players, and various other men do pull girls regularly

if he was elite enough, he would. if he went to sea, he would, because his race would make him elite, alongside his looks

True. This is why Tinder (the app known that's more for hookups) has 21.9% women while bumble has 43% women. Even though hookups happen in both, bumble has more of a reputation for relationships, so women go there.

If women went for their looksmatch they could easily get a long term relationship. Marriage even. It's simply hoeflation where an ugly girl thinks she deserves a hot guy, average girl thinks she deserves a model, and a hot girl thinks she deserves a demigod. Even if they somehow lucked into such a relationship they'd be looking to cheat the entire time. The only solution is to outlaw sex outside of marriage and punish violators harshly with public beatings or sometimes execution by beatings. Women should also not be allowed to vote or have a bank account. Strange as it seems I guarantee women would be far happier under such a, system. Many people like to blame social media too but I'm undecided on the subject. A better safe than sorry approach would probably be wise here so banning it is a good idea, but I'm not sure how to implement such a thing. Maybe just make it illegal for women to have photos and videos of them posted online.

>Girls, by and large, don't want casual sex
this is a lie.
casual sex used to be taboo and sex within relationships was the norm.
women explicitly promoted casual sex during the sexual revolution because they wanted casual sex with hippy chads.
never forget this. do not believe women when they say they don't want casual sex because women explicitly politically campaigned against laws and social norms so that they could have casual sex with chad.

If women don't want casual sex then why do they do it? Inb4 self-reported 'studies' where women conveniently leave out the first 2 years of college

And yeah, no shit people settle. The problem is that men can be happy with a 6/10 looksmatch girlfriend. She cannot.

Didn't read any more. You're retarded, simple as. Women can get casual sex as well as commitment, a husband, children, and whatever the fuck she could want incredibly easily. Their lack of difficulty is not limited to casual sex

I admire how completely detached from reality you are. 
Your expert MLG pro Evo Psych theory misses that both the most monogamous and most polygamous species on Earth all share the aptitude of a man to impregnate thousands of girls at once. Whether a species mates for life or just that one time, the man will have the ability to impregnate many more women than the reverse. Thus, this capacity is not the driver in monogamous/polygamous inclinations. 
Additionally, your assertion that women "by and large, don't want casual sex" is absurd on the face of it - not even worth a retort.

They fixed up hands and teeth in the latest Stable Diffusion model (or maybe the one before the latest one). 
Realistically, the hands cope was just cope and they were always going to be able to make hands. Just a matter of time.
--- 73081221
This also missed the point.
The issue is not about who gets to fuck, if you cant rizz up a woman thats a skill issue.
The problem is the devaluing of family and loyalty.
Why is it a problem? Well, first of all, less people are born, because none of the people having intercourse actually have children, so you get deglobalization (capitalism and city moving already brings deglobalization, but hookup culture pushes it further / faster).
The second issue, is that incels leave the country and go to fkn zimbabwe or siria to marry a girl who has never seen a man in her life, this means EVEN LESS people are born AND there are less workers.

You know the hole debate about abortion? 
Well, nobody actually cares that fetuses die.
The reason abortion is needed is to prevent a country from reaching an average age of 50 (aka italy, japan is a couple years), which would lead to economic collapse, after pension cuts and many other political issues.

That's a very conservative way of looking at female sexuality.
That's assuming all women have the same mating strategies. If men have different mating strategies so do women.
How many women want to commit to just one man's lineage?

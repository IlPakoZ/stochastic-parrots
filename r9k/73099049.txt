>why don't they learn to stop doing that.
"doing that" is generally meant to refer to an aforementioned action or action verb. There was no action or action verb in your sentence before. The only verb used was the verb "weren't" (were), which is in fact, not an action verb, but a verb meant to attach a description to a noun. Also, you forgot a question mark.

Why should they take any risk when they can manipulate you to risk your ass?

I hate this shit about saying women are manipulative. They aren't manipulating you, you are just horning and doing things for them cause you think it will get you laid. I have never seen any evidence that women are more manipulative than men. Just that men are willing to go out of there way for women for no real reason.

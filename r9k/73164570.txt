My uncle richie was 20 around 1969 and was drafted out of technical school and sent to vietnam. His life has been far tougher than mine and it's embarrassing to think that a mentally ill weirdo like me could make it through being an infantry man in vietnam and twenty years of shit jobs in the hellscape that was old New York City. if rich boomers fucking things up then endless proles were walked on just like always. Forget this generational war crap

there are many based boomers they just have no power. they were drafted to vitnam or iraq or whatever, they worked in factories and were layed off, they bought houses and were foreclosed on. The rich kid boomers who dodged the draft and majored in liberal arts and marched for niggerrs freedom or whatever were propelled to the top and thats why we all hate boomers because the only boomers we know are cringe and overshadow the based ones. same shit will happen with our generations kids in the future will be like fuck zoomies man. all the based ones will live in the shadows as the cringe ones ruin our generations reputation

Over the last 15 years or so, I'm almost certain that there's been an increase in targeted attacks on wizards/virgins/incels/outcasts/losers *because* they've been proving the just world fallacy is just that, a fallacy.

More and more normalfags are falling by the wayside in our lopsided economy and those niggers are starting to realise it.

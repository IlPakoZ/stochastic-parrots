Indentify your insecurities and engage in exposure therapy e.g. doing thing(s) that make you scared/nervous/uncomfortable repeatedly until your brain learns by force that whatever you think is a problem is actually harmless.

good point. 
It's also important to have a healthy lifestyle, do something that need your attention like at work, at the gym, hobbies and so on. If you know what your strong points are and what you got you will be a lot more happy. Since I lift and started working more at university/ later my job I just don't care about things that would've made me explode only a few years ago. 

Remember that "The Dude" fought in vietnam, he is the most chilled guy ever, because he probably saw people dying next to him. 
Walter on the other hand never fought in Vietnam, but is the most aggressive guy, because he probably never had a chance to really dig in the mud and lived on the edge. He missed out on something and tries to compensate how he thinks someone who fought vietnam would act. He is an cliche.

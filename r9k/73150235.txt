decent aesthetics wrapping up even more anti-life cope than christianity

It's the only thing that makes sense desu

Christians:
>wow the world is shit and unrelentingly cruel
>but I already believe G*d is good so I will do mental gymnastics to prove G*d is good despite his world being shit :)

Gnostics:
>wow the world is shit and unrelentingly cruel
>that must mean its creator is evil

The temperament of G*d should be the conclusion, not the basis of your thought process. Christians think backward.

its a cope with the problem of evil. the problem of evil is evidence against a good god's existence, but there are alot of debates and arguements against an evil god, which are contradictory to gnosticism

It is better than Hermeticism, especially of the kybalion type

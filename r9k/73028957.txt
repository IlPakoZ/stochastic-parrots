They are disgusting. This weird emasculation of men is gross. These people should put into camps and forced to become normal. Reeducate them and then make them form a cannon fodder division like the French Foreign legion to set the ones who survive on the correct path. As for you Anon you probably also need this to be done to you. You are a man who's mind has been destroyed by the internet. You've consumed too much degenrate content making you into a tranny loving faggot. 

You people are the reason why I feel nothing but joy over those "woooo spooky anti gay laws" and why I could not care less about what the middle east does with its homosexuals because its probably deserved.

Convenient, but hardly true. Such boy would hate both you and himself for being gay, making the relationship impossible. He wouldn't even allow himself to open his heart for another boy. His homophobia would stop it, just like yours.

I don't you're being completely honest, anon. 
The reason why you don't care about homophobia is not because of roaming online degenerates. 
It's because there's only one thing you hate more than degenerates: you being one of them

The bible says many things, anon. The path of salvation is narrow according to it, meaning that most people would go to hell for a myriad of other reasons. It's a book that disguises itself as the holy truth, but it contains a lot of hatred inside.

I bet. But do you really have to try dating them? 
Can't you keep talking to them online as well as trying dating irl? 
You may even say that you don't talk to them with dating in mind, but don't be fooled. The line is blurry and you know it. Every ounce of attention you give to these anonymous strangers is one bit less that you give to the real boys you should be flirting with

I understood that perfectly, I think you're the one who got it wrong. 
I said that I don't want to resist the urge anymore, I'd rather indulge in it. I've slain the faith I was born into long ago, and cast it away. I no longer have a will to resist it. What stops me isn't faith driven willpower, but fear of talking to strangers.
--- 73030619
>>73030188
yeah because you're probably fucking boring, annoying, or schizo. or all three! if people go quiet randomly without saying anything then they either weren't looking for a long lasting friendship, real life caught up to them, or they just don't fucking like you. i've had a really small group of online friends (not the discord just posted) that's cycled through more than a handful of people every few years but the same main 3 are always there. the ones that did leave either had college/university, got irl relationships and never hang out online in general, or had some sort of drama/falling out for one reason or another. it's not hard to maintain an online friendship you just have to actually be engaging as a person otherwise, yeah. it is incredibly pointless logging on for someone who has very little to offer conversationally

>ghosting people is always a shitty move
not if the person being ghosted is excruciatingly annoying or creepy, that being said i think another good point to make is that yeah. you likely are not going to find friends off 4chan, or at least this board. most of the people i met online was through video games, and then we'd play together and just talk more in general and end up with sharing interests and then doing other stuff together outside of the game. that's quite literally how easy it is.
>>73030635

yeah i can kind of see that. people can ghost for random reasons, sure. but if you find it happening to yourself really often, maybe try to see why/where it went wrong? 
>You sound very defensive over someone saying online friendships are bullshit. 
sorry you read my tone that way but in no way am i defensive, i'm just sharing that just because online friendships CAN be this ephemeral thing that can just disappear without a trace it's very rare for it to happen if you meet the right people with the right intentions
>but it really pales in comparison with real life friendships
kind of, i've met a few of them in real life now on two occasions. it was pretty fun! it's largely distance that makes it hard for it to be a regular thing.
>>73030732
it is objectively without a shadow of a doubt a completely bad faith take to assume that every relationship online, even offline for that matter, are purely for the sake of entertainment. this is what i mean about you lacking emotional maturity, you assume they're all a one-sided exchange.

>And being ghosted online isn't rare, it's the norm actually
i mean, here? yeah. i can't speak for the rest of 4chan, though i assume stuff like /soc/ is probably similar. but ghosting online isn't the norm outside of 4chan.
>Yeah nothing as easy and trivial as meeting "the right one" right? 
this is kind of what i was getting at, going through the people of this specific thread trying to find a lasting friendship is pretty difficult to do. that's why i'm saying it's much easier through other methods i.e talking to people who play the same video game as you. which is probably easier if the games you enjoy are multiplayer or have a communal aspect to them already. you can still get ghosted but it's less likely to happen through that, rather than here where people will actually just drop you after not replying quick enough or because they're so Le BPD Autismo that they shriek and block people for no reason, like the other anon said

>Like I said, online "relationships" pale in comparison
sure? i think it also just depends on your personality, if you're a super extroverted person who needs to go out every weekend to have fun obviously a real life interaction is going to be the preferred thing but if you don't go out often i don't think it's any less fulfilling?
>>73030916
>Said the closeted gay. 
not closeted, out to my friends and family. i just always found it pointless, i always said i'd come out when i got a bf and then as i got older i just decided i didn't care. it didn't change anything, which is lucky i guess, but also again changed literally nothing.

Danzai Imagefag is 100% Correct, why do you guys just whine about this shit incessantly?

jannies* newfriend. anyways, there was a pretty dedicated jannie here years ago who would delete all the furshit but let silmaryl post freely (he was an imagefag in case you also didn't know that), either way it's not like avatarfagging alone is what kills the threads. they were arguably even more active with tripfags, something WAY more hated.

The thing in question being a completely avoidable reality. You hate the Brazilian. Don't reply. People reply to the Brazilian? Change the topic. Imagefag posts? Ignore him. Someone replies?

The problem is that you never exposed yourself to such things, anon. You're running away from them, constantly.

i was messing with the colors displayed in the prompt string that appears when you open up a terminal. the colors of the prompt can be changed using ANSI escape codes in a configuration file. i was using the escape sequences by themselves and was getting an issue where long commands in the terminal would cause the cursor to go back to the beginning of the same line instead of starting a new one. then i read that you need to escape the escape codes in order for the cursor to keep track of it's own position, so i did that, was kind of hard to look at because it's a lot of \'s and ['s and ]'s to keep track of in the middle of all the other stuff you want the prompt to print. still wasn't working, turned out that i missed a ] at the end of just one of the color codes which was causing the problems. stupid and elementary but i'm retarded ofc so that doesn't help much...

I swear you kinda sound like a friend of mine speaking lol and he's Brazilian too. Anyway not the point. I never really had gay friends since conservative country and the ones that are don't particularly show so its kinda hard and I don't want to use apps cause that's just a quick fuck.
And no I will not do this year, I plan on leaving my home country it'd be really dumb trying to get someone here, that would lead to a terrible distant relationship and I don't want that, its not an excuse no matter how you look at it, its just the logic decision.

Apps could solve that problem
>Don't want to use apps
Bummer. The apps are whatever you make of them. If all you can find is casual sex, what does that say about you? 
You can use the apps for friendships and relationships, all you need to do is filter through people. 
Alternatively you can keep being a lonely celibate without any dating experience whatsoever

i have no stake in this but seeing someone say they want the monarchy back because they watched game of thrones and think that because their parents are "rich" doctors they wouldn't be considered lower class... your parents are the doctors. not you. you are a leech as it stands both in this society and in a monarchy. maybe if you were also a doctor?

countries that have sprouted up facism do it because conservativism is done on the basis of fear, so yes obviously there's going to be a lot of anti-*anything* policies that spring up because minorities are the easiest target. but i am saying that fascism as an ideology at a base level does not make it so every fascist HAS to also be a conservative anti-gay dictator. it can be a pro-gay one. it's all hypothetical. never said we SHOULD have it because dictators ARE bad but intellectually it is very wrong to say fascism is immediately equivalent to nazis it's just a very known historical example that is easily able to be pointed to

This website would likely be considered degeneracy, as would all forms of social media. Your meme? Wouldn't exist. It's making fun of politicians. This website would be seen as Hedonist Haven.

No you're just dying on the hill to prove that fascism isn't 100% anti gay, just 99,998% anti gay, so you can appease the inner /poltard/ inside you that it's actually okay to be a faggot fascist.

Why wouldn't the other things happen? Of course social media is degenerate. It also holds attention whoring and narcissism at it's core. Anonymous message boards would maybe exist, but then if that's the case they'd be highly limited. In the case of you not getting a boyfriend, you'd likely be executed for not having a child with a woman or being in a traditional family structure.

Brown people? Banned. Get em outta here. Kick em all out. 
4chan? Completely unharmed. It will be the internet's little zoo to watch the monkeys. 
Architecture? It should all be forced to look like European villages and cities and such
Gay people? Not banned but shamed by society.
Trannies? banned. Get em outta here. 
Infrastructure? more trains and such. Trains are cool. 
Africa? colonized by Anglos and Germans and TND!!!!
South America? Completely colonized by Anglos and Germans. 
Asia? Allowed to stay for now. 
Space colonies? Uh hell yeah I want gundam but in real life.

I never understand why it's considered bad to dislike whore culture, at least for gays in America. You're either labelled a prude or as if you're somehow missing out on core part of being human. I get it, sex is important to a lot of people and I don't think you should stay a virgin your entire life and should definitely seek out a relationship sooner than later in life but. I'm not crazy right, it is gross how much gay sex is just a commodified reality? Straight sex isn't the same, granted that could be because it's the default and no one's batting an eye at it.

But you want to shame and discriminate whores. The irony? You're a fag. A degenerate worse than a whore in a the eyes of many. You don't have the moral high ground to shame anyone. You're just another hypocrite.

>I'm not crazy right, it is gross how much gay sex is just a commodified reality?
You are crazy. It's not gross. Gay sex isn't commodified at all. It needs to be normalized way more than it currently is. What makes you even say our sex is commodified when it's actually repressed and shunned more than anything? 
>Straight sex isn't the same, granted that could be because it's the default and no one's batting an eye at it.
You solve the puzzle yourself, and even so you still derive the homophobic, gay demonizing conclusion that there's wrong with our sex.
--- 73032828
>>73032794
it's fun to pretend, yeah. it's not fun to try and deconstruct something. do you ever hear a kid say they want to build a spaceship to the moon and then push up your glasses and start telling them how it's super hard because they're not an engineer or technician

It's always fun to see incels in this thread reveal their /pol/ influences.

its not very difficult
>>73032834
you could literally just copy paste messages with context into chatgpt and reply yourself but this would be very stupid and dumb because it's engaging with him. 
>>73032841
literally, yes. that is what i have been saying for days (2) now.
--- 73032883

--- 73032934
>>73032883
you don't think it's more special treatment to genuinely engage with stupidity to stroke your intellectualism rather than just baselessly humor it?
>>73032887
i'm sure you have the physiognomy to match
>>73032888
it's better when they roll with it and its fun for everyone involved!
--- 73032957
sometimes I'm reminded of why you are alone and I'm like "oh, that's why"
--- 73032973
>>73032895
Yes, High res images takes away soul. Its the same as taking showers. It washes away your vril and spirit. 

>>73032907
Serious talk the other avatar fag, Mr ventifag constantly posts a anime boy which looks like he is 10 and wants to fuck him. If you want to talk about pedophiles bring it up with the other guy.

>Halo games i'll play next year. 
how come not right now?
>So much of them
i mean kind of. but mainline is pretty thin. 1-5 +infinite + reach. i guess ODST too but idunno if thats what others would call mainline. theirs a lot if you consider halo wars and stuff. i dont know how to recommend how to play them, i played halo 3 as a kid, and then reach and it wasnt until later i looked into the lore i knew how everything connected. technically in canon reach comes before halo CE but i dont know if anyone would recommend to start with that- if i was going to get somebody into the franchise right now i might just look up a lore video and have them play any game, since theirs metric fuck ton of lore that predates the mainline shit
>Vid related (didn't finish yet)
ty, i love these 
>Did you watch destiny talk to adin ross?
link me it and i will! i havent seen destiny shite in too long! i also only know about adin being a fucking retard, i saw he was ESFP or something too which is like the pinnacle of retard personality type lmfao

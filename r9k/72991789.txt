I'm starting a new type of thread on this board. 1/3 threads at this point are about muh virgin wife and all women being whores, so feel free to use this thread to talk about why you want an inexperienced woman and exchange advice on getting one or whatever.

I don't really care about virginity. But I would prefer a woman who's never had casual sex or been in a FWB type relationship.

I dont care about virginity but i recall back in 2014 there was a pretty unknown french femanon who had a fetish for virgin guys and would let you sleep with her for free, i wonder if she still comes here. I think she had a polish femanon friendtoo

I fell for the wait until marriage meme and now I'm a 30 year old virgin. I'm not fat and have a decent job, any fembots in Europe want to just take my vcard?

Uuuu, think I can talk openly here.

I'm 19, pretty attractive and can get laid pretty causally but every single woman I've ever talked to from the ages 14-28 that I wasn't related to, was a whore. Where do I find romantically inexperienced women? I'm so fucking done, I don't even try to talk to women anymore, I just sit at home and hate that I was born in this timeline. I want someone that hasn't even had their first romantic kiss so bad bros.

I'm tall and in shape, young and have a job and my own place. Women have shown interest in me but for some reason it's always the super promiscuous women. I just want to meet another virgin who is not fat or deformed and between 18-30 who also wants to fall in love and start a family. I would also want her to do anal and oral once we start having sex after marriage.

I get that, valuing love over lust is a big bonus

It's not a meme, it's just meant for women instead of men, dummy

Should've made your move much much earlier in life

You're being used for your ressources, that's all. You're not being loved by these women, don't forget that.
--- 72991960
>>72991921
No one is going to love me unconditionally, obviously people love you for what you can do for them. She wouldn't love me if I didn't provide resources and I wouldn't love her if she didn't lose her virginity to me or if she didn't stay loyal to me.
--- 72991968
>>72991960
Yesn't. Obviously unconditional love doesn't exist, but I'd argue people can be so attracted to a person that they obsess over them and open up to depend on each other. That's the love I'm talking about.

im saving myself for marriage but i never find guys who is doing the same

I was 19 yo just a few week ago too.
Im not attractive by any means but I can confirm your experiences zoomerbro. (And im from a "trad" shithole). 
It is what it is, our gen is the way it is.
You should have settled some years ago.
--- 72992015
>>72991968
Yeah but I could have that, it doesn't seem like an unrealistic thing to achieve. The initial love is because of the things you do for each other but once you fall in love you actually appreciate the person for who they are and for the fact they chose to become yours.

It's usually because guys are actively discouraged by other women when trying to stay virgins. I got made fun of for having less experience than the girls I was talking to on numerous occasions. "Virgin" and "incel" only apply to men and women use it all the time. Women like experience and men like inexperience.

You should specify that you exclude guys from here because plenty of guys here are just that

most of the time its tradlarpers i.e. guys who say theyre waiting until marriage but would jump in bed on day 1 with a non-fat girl who gives them attention. or its some pornsick guy with deranged kinks. i just want a guy who is vanilla and actually has saved himself for marriage.

I just started looking attractive at the end of 17 and I was busy with all sorts of things that year. Then came the latter half of my 18th year and the start of this year and most of that was being at home due to insomnia. Finally fixed that and went out to see the world of dating as it is, and it's all whores. 

What I don't understand is that if men already need much longer to start looking attractive, how are we supposed to keep up with women losing their v cards so early if we wish for virgins? I was fucked before the game even started even tho I have all the right cards.

I'm saving myself for marriage but I would want to try mildly kinky things like anal or throat fucking after marriage, would that eliminate me?
--- 72992074
>>72992064

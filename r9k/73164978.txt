How does it feel when a girl lusts after you? How does it feel when her eyes light up with interest and passion and she gets red and licks/bites her lips while staring at your face? How does it look to lie on a bed very very close staring into each other?

>>73164978 (OP)
it's cringe. because two out of two times it will be a disgusting pajeeta or fat whore.

are you trying to imply normal women don't feel lust and aren't attracted to men?
--- 73165052
>>73165026
no. normal (hot) women get even hornier. but they will not show you unless you bait it out. if you're a shy dude good luck at staring until she gets bored and claimed by bbc.

TL;DR: Meh.
When I was 26 I dated a 19 and she was always super horny for me. It was nice, but like once you have sex available to you 24/7 you realize how insignificant being a virgin really is.
it was a tad awkward when I'd wake up to her rubbing her pussy on my leg but I never really called her out on it cause like... Sex.
I've had other girls crush hard on me because I'm decently attractive, have a deeper voice, and have that awkward charm and yet that seriously dangerous badboy energy.

That being said, it's weird. Like, my life doesn't feel better for it. Like sure, I wanted sex a lot more when I was still a virgin, but like... It's just like any other desire, "I want a car sooo bad" "I want to rent/own my own home so bad" "I want some woman to suck on my dick swallow my sperm and then let me fuck her raw 20 minutes later soooo bad!"

I'm not talking about the sex itself! I'm talking about passion, attraction, dedication. Being valued by someone, being enough for them as you are, being an object of intense desire. I would feel a lot of pressure to reciprocate and generally be the best person i can be. And it sounds like heaven to actually have her take the initiative
I understand that most things seem insignificant when you finally get them. But same can be said about running water- we take it for granted and don't find much joy in washing our hands, but imagine never getting to experience it and having to walk for hours to get muddy water from a well 
>>73165092
why did that hurt you?

>>73165066
In my experience it's less about looks and more about the woman having her shit together that determines if a woman will fuck outside of her race.
wf Interatrial dating is usually done so for the sake of pissing off daddy or being annoying as fuck and acting like a degenerate well calling others degenerates for not accepting your "perfectly normal" love life.

But yes, fat ugly retards will date out of their race too, but I feel like that's lowkey a desperation thing.

I think you're trying to imply love but what you described is more a matter of obsession and yeah....
All I'm going to say is that every inexperienced man thinks he wants a qt3.14 yandere gf until they have one...
I have had a few restraining orders put out on me because when I get backed into a corner I will swing/backhand someone, regardless of size or gender... But I've put a total of 1 restraining order out against one of my exs.
Chicks that "love" you that intensely are ALWAYS mentally unstable and it will get to the point where you will feel the need to leave for your safety if nothing else and they will not let you go.

If you're that shortsightedly conceited to think you want to the center of someone elses world than by all means, date a girl with DID that got molested by her dad and is reminded of all of the good traits her father when she's around you.

That pure bliss obsession you're talking about only happens in anime.

But it's the sad type of horny. I fantasize about listening to music and getting drunk/trying out drugs toghether. Lying face to face on a small bed under covers, rubbing our hands all over each other's naked bodies, staring into each other's eyes, feeling each other's warm breaths and quick heartbeats, french kissing until most of her saliva is in my mouth and most of mine is in hers...

Anon, it seems you're a terrible judge of character! Yes, i want obsessive love, not casual love. But i don't want to restrict, control or abuse my partner nor get that treatment, i still want a relationship based on trust, compromise and reciprocity, i just imagine love as this intense unconditional feeling
Okay, even if this cannot be maintained forever, i'd still rather have such a relationship and get burned than never have it and only dream of it.
>they will not let you go.
but why would i want to go away? i'm not a cheater, i really want to stay with one woman for my entire life and really invest into making her a wonderful person
everyone starts as broken and deeply flawed.
>If you're that shortsightedly conceited to think you want to the center of someone elses world than by all means
What else can be a center of one's world? Religion? Work and money? Politics? All sounds like terrible ideas. I think putting your wife, marriage and kids in the center is the most healthy and natural thing to do.
>date a girl with DID that got molested by her dad and is reminded of all of the good traits her father when she's around you.
I want to obsess over a girl and i wasn't molested....
>That pure bliss obsession you're talking about only happens in anime.
Then where did they get that idea?

cant lie my heart literally fastened just reading that. plus kissing is one of the best and important acts to me, there can't be a better form of intimacy than it really.

drop your contact then and he will see. no reason to picrel when you could be talking in private.

Yes, letting someone's tongue into your mouth leaves you so vulnerable and having their head touch yours is very romantic.

i've never lusted after a guy and idk if that means i'm a lesbo
the only time i've ever gotten like super wet with a guy was when i had someone spoon me and kiss my neck for an entire 2 hr movie (but the guy was ugly so i think the arousal came more from the novelty of never having been touched like that)

>>73165751
did you find a soul mate there? did you have to refuse female advances or felt pressured to interact with them?

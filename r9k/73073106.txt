>the less bitter and hateful I become 
>the more girls like me 

I unironically think many incels and robots dig their own graves when it comes to romance. No one wants to be with a bitter or hateful person, least of all if they're ugly too. If you don't have Chad's looks, then you at least need a good personality to compete.

I was at my most sexually active and successful when I was at my most bitter, resentful and hateful. On dating apps I'd just tell women they looked like a good distraction and make fun of them on the date, only for them to invite me back to their place for unprotected sex. People really do not give a shit how awful you are as long as you're not ugly, but if you're ugly, nobody cares about how "good" (submissive and pathetic) you are.

That is light teasing at best. Most incels spew unfiltered vitriol. You are right though that being good looking gives a lot of margin for error, and what you do or say is much less important than if you were average looking or ugly.

the most success i've had with girls is lying, manipulating and acting like an asshole.
the girl i told to cut my name into herself and made her break down over and over fell in love with me and i visited her and took her virginity

what's the lesson here?

I'm never going to stop being autistic and I'm never going to adhere to masculine gender roles or be confident. So no matter how bitter or not bitter I am, women will still fucking loathe, despise the thought of being with me. My personality is inherently shit and would need to be changed in ways that are incompatible with who I am/want to be, in order to be liked by women. So yeah I'll stay butter and die sad about it

>>73073171
I guess I didn't really consider low empathy people in my post. Yes dark triad behavior is tried and true, even if you're ugly, but I feel sick to my stomach treating people like that. 
>>73073204
Having such a strict sense of identity, especially if it's proven to make you miserable, it silly anon. Don't be stubborn, you can change while still beeing urself, within reason ofc.
--- 73073266
>>73073237
I've tried to change in the ways that would matter, in the past. It felt even more miserable than just being myself. I know who I am and what I want to be. Life this way is miserable but I can at least find some little enjoyment in it even though it sucks to never be accepted by women. I can do another 50 years of this shit. Life the other way? The "trying to change in order to pander to women's standards" way? That had me legit suicidal

Nah, I was pretty vitriolic. I used to just give women the worst shit and mock them horribly, but they didn't care because I was edgy and decent looking.
--- 73073292
>>73073266
Your two options aren't 'purely bee myself' or 'pander to women'. You need to see things in a more nuanced light imo. My advice would be lean into the good parts of your personality and tone down the bad. Also not self monitoring your behavior at all isn't 'beeing urself', it's just lazy and decadent. Even women and Chads have to bite their tongue from time to time to have successful relationships.

If I'm a good person and i feel bad because of others then me hating is justified, if I'm bad then i have no reason to care.
If it's only about other people that don't care for me then i have no real need to care either.
Simple as that.

>>73073279
>pretty vitriolic 
I doubt it was what I'm imagining when I think 'vitriolic'. But I agree that having good looks gives you a ton of margin for error. I'm not good looking and have gotten pretty smooth with women out of necessity. The shit I see good looking guys say and succeed with makes me laugh, it really is another difficulty setting.

You don't know anything even approaching what it's like to be an incel.
Try talking about incel experiences when you've literally not talked to a woman outside of a business relationship ( i.e. work or service) for literal YEARS.

if this were true then how do you explained the required start point for this self digging grave?

At some point (many actually) i was genuinely polite, friendly, and likeable and this was spun into "hes a pushover" or some flavor of "hes boring" leading to a negative outcome.

it happened one too many times and now i laugh when i see women suffering and i refuse to interact with them whenever i can help it.

I'm not firmly against changing anything about myself - but there's aspects of me that are hated by women that I personally just like and don't want to change

It's not like I'm out here saying "I just wanna be myself so I'm gonna punch holes in walls when I'm mad and be racist and hateful and selfish" or something like that

I used to be like that except took continuous and deliberate effort to change. When I was 20 I couldn't even talk to a woman, now I can flirt and shoot the shit with pretty strangers like it's nothing. That wasn't an accident. 
>>73073320
I had similar experiences, we are victims of feminism. Women love to shit on 'nice' guys without realizing many of them are products of feminism. What women consciously say they want and what they subconsciously want are two completely different things, thus the constant mixed signals they give men, the tragic part is their subconscious ultimately chooses who they date, fuck etc. 

The best way to get women is to be interesting, engaging, sexy etc. That's why dark triad, or empathetic, interesting people get girls. The worst thing you can do is be boring and hateful. I also think this is why so many white guys are 'boring' or 'npcs', because they were raised in the most dogmatically feminist upbringings that made them hardcore suppress their male instincts which women actually want and receive well. The bottom line is that actions speak louder than words, and that even though women say they 'want nice guys', this is bullshit most of the time. What they actually want are interesting and sexy guys. Playing it safe and being 'nice' is a surefire way to fail unless you're good looking. 
>>73073335
That's fair, but expect similar results without change.

I was always stoic enough to not let the hate get to me so I'm generally "a pleasant person to be around, just a little quiet." yet I'm still completely uninteresting for the other gender.

I feel like all this talk about attraction is just a cope to distract from the fact that it's all about the biological impressions. Meaning looks and looks alone. It has never been about personality and never will be. It's always looks first and then impressions of one's personality. If chad behaved like an animal, it might be a turn off for some but imagine the opposite: non chad behaving like a well adjusted human being, there is nothing attractive or unattractive about this.

I think robots tend to underemphasize how important personality is because they want to be doomers and give up. It's easier to throw your hands up and post Chadfishing Tinder screenshots than to do hard work to change for the better. 

Looks are the most important thing, I won't bullshit, but personality is also very important, and vitally more in our control. You can choose to treat someone well just like you can choose to let your bitterness seep out and affect other people. The way I see it there are three main categories for female to male attraction... 

1. Looks, this is self explanatory, 40% 
2. Personality, this is much more subjective, but many types of personalities can be effective, it depends on what the girl likes, and one girl can even like different types of personalities. The number one rule connecting all successful personality types, whether they be dark triad, or charismatic, or empathetic, is that they are all interesting without making the girl too uncomfy, and hit their pussy tingles in different or similar ways, 30% 
3. Status/money, also pretty self explanatory, if you're a rich surgeon, this is massively attractive to a huge amount of women, 30%

You're just agreeing with me, real vitriol can hardly be considered filtered. You fail to understand just how socially incompetent many r9k users are. Have you seen the text screenshots people post here and unironically wonder what they did wrong

There's a huge difference between being retarded and hateful.
--- 73073705
>>73073679
What I'm saying is that the average robot's problem is that they're hateful and socially retarded at the same time, I figured it went without saying that they would not be socially competent, but I guess you have to qualify that nowadays on r9k.

It's even simpler than that, "Incel" is a personally identity based on lack and alienation, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's like calling yourself involuntarily poor, or involuntarily under 6 ft. tall, while those may be facts, taking a victim mentality about it only leaves you bitter and cynical.

Hard agree, that's why r9k is so cancerous as well, it gives losers a sense of belonging, but you have to stay a loser to keep that sense of community.

im not gonna change and im not interested in being a family man anymore.
all my my gains are for me and if its ever enough ill just pay surrogate women to birth kids that they will have zero influence on.

also i will NEVER help a woman EVER again.
Flat tire? You can call a tow or something.
Need advice because you have no father? Fuck off i don't wanna hear it.
Want me to buy you food or drink? Sorry im not a charity.
Etc.

There could be a woman literally dying in front of me and i will just continue like i saw nothing, not my problem. I wouldn't wanna give them the ick or something, would I?

I realize it hurts to be continually rejected and even treated with callous disdain and hatred, but becoming hateful yourself isn't the answer. At the very least because it will only make you miserable. Yeah people can suck, but ultimately most of the time other people hurt you it's because they're selfish, not because they are actively trying to do you harm.
--- 73073952
>>73073900
Doesn't matter.

You can never get back all the lost time.
Women literally stole my prime years from me by being disingenuous and manipulative when i was young, naive, and vulnerable. 

To think that I am even capable of being on even terms with a woman at this point is laughable.

It like being wrongfully convicted and spending a decade in prison and when they realize and release you, they don't apologize or pay you or anything. Imagine the outcome for THAT situation.

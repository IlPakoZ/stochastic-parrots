Does anyone else feel guilty for having 'male urges'? 

I was brainwashed by feminism my whole life so every time I have aggressive or sexual thoughts I feel automatic guilt and shame. The fucked up and ironic part is that women like this aggressive side of me, especially sexually, but I tend to suppress it due to my upbringing

I'm guessing you're a zoomer? Tends to be the common mindset these days, lest your face gets plastered on social media and your life gets ruined because you're a toxic monkey man.

Life is tricky. I'd worry more about finding a girl first.

You're a retard and should kill yourself if you feel so guilty

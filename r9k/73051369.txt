Sorry, I'm gonna play Fallout New Vegas. I just managed to swap out a weapon model for the marksman carbine but I still have quite a few more mods to install.

I liked Crypt of the Necrodancer a lot, played Axiom Verge but never finished it. Haven't found the itch to play an indie game for awhile since I finished Bastion (steam)

>The Messenger
Is the messenger really that good? I've seen some gameplay of it and it kinda looks subpar.
I wanna try some of these games but I don't have much money.

EU4

I pirated all of those games myself, no need to waste money.
The messenger is fun, it starts linear but becomes a metroidvania somewhere down the line, has good music and the cloudstep mechanic is fun to use. It's not great, but it's good.

I prefer to own my games, even if just digitally through steam another online store, I like getting achievements and being able to install/uninstall whenever, and I don't like clogging up my HDD with random shit. I pirate other things though like movies tv shows or manga.

>>73053233
Pirate gog games then, the installers for all those games I named must add to 4gb tops.

>Pirate gog games then
Huh? I don't know what you mean by that sorry.
--- 73053308
>>73053301
I mean you should pirate games from GoG, the other famous online store, second to Steam.
--- 73053389
>>73053308
That's not what I mean, I said I don't like pirating because I enjoy actually owning my games, and that I don't wanna clog up my HDD. It has nothing to do with online stores.
--- 73053412
>>73053389
And I said all those games, worth hundreds if not THOUSANDS of hours, are all together 10 times smaller than a single AAA game from the last 10 years.
--- 73053656
>>73053412
What does that have to do with liking pirating? It's not the game size that's the problem it's the clutter.

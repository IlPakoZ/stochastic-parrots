Human eyes can be fucking scary. Riding the 4:30am tram to work with the blue collars who just want to sleep is something else.

Green eyes occur when the nody does not make enoughb melanin for them to be brown but more than if they were blue. Generaly hair eyes and skin darken over time. So its not impossible.
My eyes are the same color as bluejeans.

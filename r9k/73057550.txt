I know robots hate regular trannies, but how do you guys feel about female-to-male trannies?
--- 73057568
I have an odd respect for them they chose to play the game of life on nightmare mode.

I'm fwb with one at the moment. Shit's cash. Best head I've ever had in my life and she's really freaky.

do ftms that like guys take it the ass or the pussy? Assuming she doesn't have the frankendick.

She has only let me fuck her pussy so far.

Wow, that's really impressive. Must be because of how male he looks.

they're playing on the hardest difficulty, so it's either pity (if i find them annoying) or respect (if they're otherwise cool). being women, the vast majority fall into the first category.

an even mix between finding them ridiculous for thinking male privilege is a thing that they will automatically enjoy from being a 5'5'' small goofy dude with a skin sausage at best or a freak in the uncanny valley, and feeling sorry for them when they realize there was no privilege and that they fucked their life up forever.

some are really hot, the fat ones just look like gross dykes

Imagine being this lost. No faggots will ever find her attractive. I care about being hot for the man I love. For him and no one else. I would never wear trashy, disgusting prostitute gear like "thigh highs and leather". I don't have to. Whether it is a woman or a femboy tranny, only prostitutes with negative self respect dress this horrendously.

the prisongays and pedos will. Plus bi guys who are just looking to fuck something and don't care what it is.

No ill will toward FTMs at all. I would date one if she had no surgeries and was not on hormones.

I only respect the ultra auto androphiles who want to kill themselves every time they look at their hip to shoulder ratio. It is unlikely that they'll ever be seen as real men, people are condescending to them and women lie about being ok with getting into a relationship with them. The closest thing to a real femcel.

I hate them 100x mure than mtfs
--- 73057972
Somehow even worse than mtf. They look like a side character from Always Sunny, smell horrible, and keep posting their deformed bodies on gay porn boards as if I went there to see vagina
YOU'RE NOT A MAN
PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON AND MAKE ME A FUCKING SANDWICH

the mtf meme killed tomboys as a subculture. The high sex drive thing is kinda hot but its turn off once they start looking like an actual man
--- 73058052

I meant ftm whoops
--- 73058164
ftms aren't nearly as insufferable as mtfs

Is precrel? That looks like a petite girl with an unusually flat chest. Also FTM trans insisting on being called femboys just shows they're mentally children who don't want to feel left out. Like a kid upset over not getting presents at someone else's birthday.
>how do you guys feel about female-to-male trannies?
See them as naive victims. For MTF, there's at least a sexual aspect even if they lie about it. For FTM, they're psyop victims who've permanently turned themselves into useless freaks.

Eh, kind of sad for a lot of them. They have a high detransition rate iirc and that testosterone wrecks their body. Plenty of them go bald too.

I dont hate either mtfs or ftms but ftms on 4chan tend to be more based because they kinda just track along either incel or /pol/tard and im cool with either. I have a nazi ftm friend I met on 4chan and they're a good friend

For me it's the virgin. Even if we never manage to have sex(unlikely) the fact that she chose me to be her first and that she keeps trying because she wants to do it with me would make me super happy.

I don't care in the slightest about virginity. Would maybe feel more comfortable with the more experienced woman, but if she's a 'former' whore, I'd wonder about why she's changing - because she wants to, or just because she feels expected to? As for the virgin, vaginismus means she can still be eaten out and fingered focusing on her clitoris without penetration so she can still feel pleasure, while there's less expectation to do PIV stuff, so that's a plus, but if she's someone who values virginity, that's kind of a negative

I could see either of them potentially being nice depending on the specifics

Yeah it's really not much of a question honestly. The feeling of knowing your girl only belongs to you and no one else is definitely better then actual sex.

If you want to get fucked in the ass anyways why not go for a tranny? More likely to find a virgin that way.

virgin obviously. ahead of getting over vaginismus, there's always other forms of stimulation.

Honestly I would't even need that. If I had a virgin gf and all we could do is cuddle and kiss for years I'd be fine with it. Plus even if vaginal sex is off the table you can do oral or anal, even just mutual masturbation.

A tranny virgin? LMAO maybe if she still looked like an ugly man. As soon as they pass even to the slightest degree they always become std infested whores. Plus even the ones that pass well enough for porn always still have masculine features that can detract from the experience. Not a big deal for a bit of porn viewing, but there's just no way it could work out in real life as a relationship situation spending a lot of time together.

I cried 3 times today because i only make 50k at my office job and I hate it. Nobody will hire me anywhere for more and it's depressing. I can't even get promoted within. Ive talked to my supervisor and it seemed like they were gonna help but nothing came of it. Im really hard worker. This is the worse feeling.

I know this is a shit post but 50k is nothing. That's been cited as the average yearly salary for college graduates since the mid 2000s.

The vocaroo troon known to /lgbt/ as "big soph" disproves this entirely. He comes here, posts a thread every single fucking day for YEARS asking the same fucking question and people keep replying as if it's the first time they've heard it. Thousands upon thousands of people taking the bait, every single day. We have plenty of users, they're just all painfully fucking retarded and transient.
--- 73045158
It's a shitpost forum. You act as if this was a sacred hall of wisdom, guarded by warriors of mysterious feels and le epic deep thoughts. Just because there's another generation now, who doesn't know the old memes, you're crying about the end of days.

Simps trying to get attention of some women that post here. It's disgusting. Wizarchan is much better because they have moderation and in the depression board you can't talk about other shit. They control the subjects of the boards, not like this that there is no moderation. The problem with Wizarchan is the lack of users.

It was to me, anon. And it's not just that there's a new generation. That's fine but I think the site itself is just in decline. Kids these days just don't have much interest in anonymous imageboards, it seems. Also the internet in general just seems worse

Yeah, there's always chaos agents like yourself, but not nearly so many, race bait threads get the same dull replies but they frequently die out within a dozen or so because most people know better or just filter it all.

I feel that, this place is dying, but part of me is grateful for that. I always thought I'd be some wizard still stuck here, but it turns out this place will probably die before that even happens. It's been in steady decline for years now and it doesn't look like that will stop. The smaller it gets, the faster the decline will get as people lose interest due to it being too slow.

Yeah I also think that as the older user base stops coming here or dies the number of users will decline because I don't see newer generations coming here, they all will be on social networks. But I think this still has a lot of users, in the home page it says that there is always 200,000+ users at the moment. And I also think that people will keep coming here until they are very very old. So I don't think this will die soon.

It's the bullying of women. You see this pattern emerge constantly. The subhumans chase off the women, then once the women are gone, subhumans have free rein and eventually nobody is there to rein in the subhumans and the community dies. Look at /soc/. Basically, after you get rid of the women, the community dies a natural death.

if you remove the porn and females the board would be fine. the problem is that the botom of the catalog is garbage and it keeps pushing half decent threads off. any thread that could sustain discussion dies because some retard just needed to post that porn gif and pretend they want to discuss it

Decent chance with this. I remember knowing some lads via discord messaging back in 2015-2017 that were at their wits end with life, coasting into their 30s. Afaik most of them had plans to kill themselves in a handful of years.

Who cares really. If anything I'm glad the numbers are declining. Most zoomers are on places like discord or other social media sites as opposed to forums (not reddit ofc the zoom zooms love reddit). I'd much rather have a smaller board than one like /v/ where threads don't last more than an hour.

Better than dumb faggots attaching cutesy anime girls to posts unprompted that have absolutely zero correlation. If you were to talk about the anime, the characters, or waifus specifically? Sure.
But you trannies/trannyfuckers genuinely do it for no reason. I have more respect for e-whores because they at least post their body and make themselves vulnerable, but you degenerates don't even do that.

This number is probably correct for the non-general regular posters, that is anons that post and make all random threads. 50-100.

Now for the general regulars, check out their unique IPs. From /letter/, /mbti/, /waifu/, /britfeel/, /drugfeel/, /r9gay/ you're looking at around 300-500 shared users. And of those probably around 50 make the bulk of content

Pretty bad numbers desu

These rules should filter a lot of garbage in this board. But they aren't applied or something.

Also, I don't understand for example why there has to be a thread for gays when they have their own board. Why don't they go to their board?

nigger, i make maybe one or two posts a day. sometimes a go days without writing a single post.

Barely 2-3 years ago we had endless distroon server invites, I wonder what happened to them. Did they suck in the dwindling userbase and left to greener pastures? Were the users disappointed with these servers, came back and left eventually anyway? It all feels kinda dead, not just /r9k/. Some say that everyone is in hidden private servers, the schizoest theory is that the lockdowns + covid + inflation have left the majority with serious brainrot and an inability and lack of desire to socialize, alternatively everyone gave into hard drugs and big pharma.

The trannies the CIA unleashed here after the incel shootings drove everyone off years ago. It worked perfectly. And gookm00t never cared about this board because it's red and thus unprofitable. Splitting the site into two basically segregated the red boards off into the ghetto to be slowly killed through neglect. This board will never again be what it was. It was allowed to be killed by its overseers. It's time to let it go.

>am 25-year-old robot
>graduated college and got a good job, live in good apartment
>we have a temp working at the office, 20-year-old college girl, chubby but cute
>she shows interest in me so yep, start dating first girl I can because I'm desperate
>she moves into my apartment, since she says her parents are abusive shitheads
>but that wasn't the real reason
>her parents are constantly harsh on her about her weight, but for an actual good reason
>she has a feederism fetish and they forbid her from partaking in it when she lived with them, since she started blimping out in high school
>they keep spamming my voicemail, begging me to stop "killing our daughter"
>tell them I'm not but they don't believe me
>I told gf that I refused to take part in it but I'll still love her
>however, she's getting fatter without my help
Should I panic? Chubby is cute but she looks like she'll blow past that in a couple months.

Sounds like crazy behavior, I think that you should seriously tell her that you are worried about her, that you agree with her parents intentions, and that if this impulsive eating continues the relationship is over.

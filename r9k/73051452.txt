Is there such a thing as premeditated self defense? Or are you required to be "caught by surprise" for it to be legitimate self defense?

Yes, but probably not legally? I guess it would depend legally, but something like a booby trap is premeditated self defense -- it's also illegal in the US and I'm sure it is elsewhere too.

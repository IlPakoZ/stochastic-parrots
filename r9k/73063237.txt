Are there any other species where the mail lives decades without ever reproducing? I feel like incels are a uniquely human thing because other species would just kill their equivalents of us. Meanwhile we for some reason are forced to live 70 years without ever getting our basic needs met.

Olms would be one, they live pretty long lives and sometimes just sit around doing nothing for years at a time.

Help, the chad at work won't socialise with any of the women ever since MeToo happened.

He does a bare minimum of socialising and making smalltalk. He simply says "Good morning" and proceeds to do his work.

Can I bring this up with HR?
I don't know how, but I'm sure this is the fault of the creepy weirdo that manages the server room.
--- 73057817
Is this really how people treat chads irl? I can't imagine a fucking universe where a girl asks me to hang out after work, and If I was to say no they would post on fucking Reddit to whine about how I don't spend time with them. The guy is clearly attractive and tall with a fat cock

Abouty 6 months ago I started work in a place that is 95% male and the only female on my team has actually been a good worker and pretty chill so far. I was starting to warm up to her(platonically) until this past tuesday when I mentioned my birthday in an unrelated thread of conversation and she went off on a rant about autistic astrology bullshit for like 20 minutes. My opinion of her instantly plummeted. Made me not even want to make small talk with her anymore. Why are women so into that stupid shit?

I'm 27, I like and respect my female coworkers, but there is 0 chance I would ever even try to socialize with them in anything outside of a professional context. If I fuck up, I get fired, and my entire career is gone forever. Not at all worth it.

You guys bitch, whine, and moan online about the slightest inconvenience in your quest for pussy but it's somehow bad when women bitch about things they don't like online? One screencap is. not proof of anything about women as a whole. Stop posting bullshit threads and go back to original content.

Its not the bitchy post retard, its the fact that someone in their friend circle thought about complaining to HR because some dude doesnt want hangout with them outside work or talk about work related stuff. High school drama shit, ergo a shitshow.

So one person of unknown gender has a bad idea and therefore all women are evil? Also, what's HR gonna do? There is no way you could fire someone for just being quiet without an actual reason to do so. If he's really bringing down the performance of other employees somehow, then he deserves to get fired, because he's holding the business back. Humans are social creatures and business require human interaction, you are not entitled to a job just for being quiet and getting shit done if you hold back the business as a whole.

"Getting shit done" is useless if you get the wrong shit done, or someone else isn't ready for the shit you're getting done, or you don't check with other people and do it the wrong way. Bad communication skills are a risk no business should accept.

Are women actually scared by the prospect a guy wont talk to them? The poster says that she and the other women at her workplace are uncomfortable because this guy wont interact with them, but I cant imagine why since if anything it seems like it would be more reassuring to them that hes not trying anything.

They aren't "entitled" to the company of another person.

They aren't "entitled" to get paid for sitting around and having benign conversations.

You know. No one's entitled to anything. People are always saying incels aren't entitled to women's time.

>Humans are social creatures and business require human interaction
Apparently he figured it out.

There is so much dissonance here that it's dizzying.

You see a woman complaining to strangers on the internet that a coworker isn't giving her any romantic interest, and you turn it into "Man, this guy is so entitled. He needs to get a grip". The guy that apparently doesn't even know that this person exists.

It astonishes me that women themselves, for all their vaunted empathy and social skills, never seem to realize this. They're socially coddled their entire lives which gives them leeway to be objectively retarded and lack critical thinking skills. The only ones that seem to learn went through a lot of hard times.

If you're not also giving the men of the office the silent treatment, this is passive aggressive communication and the person in question is actually in the wrong
--- 73061518
maybe he's gay and has no reason to socialise with women
--- 73061532

It can only be "passive aggressive" if he were trying to be aggressive to begin with.

He doesn't think about her. He's just doing his own thing.

>it's possible to be a bad employee because you're creating a hostile work environment
Yeah, it is. That goes both ways though.

If I were to pick someone I'd probably start off with the person that feels entitled to someone elses time and continually ignores the denial of their advances.

You're describing a one sided narcissistic relationship where one person makes all the rules.
And also she apparently does not like him but refuses to leave him alone.
And also "doing nothing" is not a solution because she creates a double bind.

This is a narcissist.
It's not even a relationship. It's a guy that signed up to do "work" and is being bitched out by a woman somewhere that he knows nothing about.

The worst part about working is the forced socialization. At my old internship (UNPAID) my bosses forced me to eat lunch in the lunchroom and socialize with my coworkers. Fucking jerks. It's hard to be "on" for 8 hours and then I couldn't even relax at lunch only when I snuck away for a piss. Absolute bullshit micromanaging crap
The guy in the op post seems fine to me I'd just be concerned from an hr standpoint (yeah yeah say what you want I'm an hr major) that this could end up as a hostile work environment if the guy started to act worse or let it impact his work. Also it would be concerning when/if he gets promoted if he would show favoritism to the men over the women in the office. Discrimination is no joke and if I knew I had an employee risking that they'd be on thin ice. Honestly he needs to grow up and treat all of his coworkers equally he's putting a target on his back. This is why you should always just act pleasant with everyone at work you never know what pull they will have or what shit they could concoct about you in their heads. And once popular opinion is turned against you it's too late you are now "that guy"
--- 73061609
>>73057783 (OP)
First rule in Work: Don't shit where you eat. If his relationship with women tends to end up in the sack, maybe he likes his job, and would rather not endanger it with the possibility of a relationship that will go beyond the platonic phase.
--- 73061673
>>73061587
>that this could end up as a hostile work environment if the guy started to act worse or let it impact his work.
Where in this is the guy complaining about anything.
Or having any opinion at all.

He isn't. He doesn't know this woman exists.

>Discrimination is no joke
1. He hangs out with 3 other men, you're just assuming that a sample size of 3 people is evidence that he would never be friends with a woman
2. He isn't "discriminating". Nothing about this involves work. He in his own interpersonal relationships hangs out with men. That's a subjective opinion, and you're not "discriminating" if you like hotdogs more than hamburgers

>an employee risking that they'd be on thin ice. Honestly he needs to grow up and treat all of his coworkers equally he's putting a target on his back. This is why you should always just act pleasant with everyone at work you never know what pull they will have or what shit they could concoct about you in their heads.
You're conflating a moral argument and an argument about what would benefit him when you say "should".

Yes, it would benefit himself if he went through the motions of socialising with someone and pretending to like them.
That's not a good thing. This is an unhappy person in a narcissistic relationship.

It's truly remarkable.
People say "YOU'RE NOT ENTITLED TO WOMEN" before you can even blink if you ever complain about a lack of female attention in any way. It's the first thing they say and they literally never think twice about it. It's their catchphrase.
You have here a woman berating a man because he said "No thank you" to her her asking him to hang out in a workplace environment, and they suddenly start bending over backwards to explain how he's obligated to be her friend.
--- 73061713
>>73061673
Ughh I can tell by the first part of your post you are a bit dumb so I won't respond to it all 
Listen it doesn't matter that he doesn't know she exists. His actions are making him stand out. By her account he goes out with coworkers and talks to his male ones but won't talk to the women. This is weird of him. If you are going to be social outside of work hours you need to be friendly to everybody. You don't need to be bosom buddies but if you are blanking all of the women specifically you'd be a retard to think people won't notice and draw their own conclusions about you.

Enjoy getting a job that you really like where you do a really good job and then getting fired because some person somewhere decides that they don't like the way you perform &lt;ambiguous social thing> for some ambiguous reason.

--- 73061755
>>73061713
You don't need to be friendly with everyone. Go fuck yourself. You don't know what's going on in people's heads, maybe a guy can't talk to women because he was abused by one as a kid and has trauma, maybe it's social anxiety, maybe he's bitter because women ruined his life and he's scared of being hurt again.

You schizophrenic nigger, the redditor in picrel is granting more empathy for that autistic incel than he has ever seen in his worthless life or deserves. Her only mistake is trying to understand him instead of leaving him alone and miserable. He is clearly hiding how much of a piece of shit he is and has Antisocial Personality Disorder, very dangerous man to associate with. These women should stay away for their safety. He'll get fired soon anyway due to how socially retarded he is

This guy is so autistic he's blanking the women in his office even when they are out at the bar with everybody and people are starting to notice. Hate women all you want but at least fake niceities with your coworkers. Don't be autistic
--- 73061797
>>73061773
Again, you don't know what's going on in people's heads. There are plenty of people out there who don't talk to anyone, women included because of issues like low self esteem, afraid they don't want to bother people. My best friend is like this and it certainly isn't because of a disability or being ignorant.
You're a wanker, mate. You want to talk about autism? You're the one who can't comprehend the idea of putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

It struck me as a Chad that didn't want to go out with any of the women. That seemed to be the impression that everyone else got to.

If it's a shy wimpy dork that just doesn't want to talk to girls, then...
That changes nothing.

Person A is not owed the attention of person B.
Or vice versa.
Or anything.
No one's entitled to anything. Remember.

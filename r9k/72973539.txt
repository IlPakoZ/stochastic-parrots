8 of 10 korean men admit they beat their gf or wife. Why do you think Korean women stopped marrying and having children.

It sounds like Koreans are wayyyyy more honest about what women actually want then, as compared to western audiences. All women want a handsome manipulative possessive and violent dark triad man. 

Why have 2/3 of women in the west been in an abusive relationship? Because thats the type of men women seek out of course.
--- 72974690
>>72973539 (OP)
Koreaboos are basically the female equivalent of weebs. The most mentally broken, rejected, and desperate people idealizing another culture due to superficial pop culture to have a sense of belonging. It's honestly sad, but even though it's fucked up, I just remember most of the girls going there are super fucked up so it isn't the worst thing ever.

yeah it was some foreign fangirl who posted smut about being gangraped in an elevator
the band ended up getting investigated and they had to track down the girl who posted it online because it was so realistic people thought it was real

You're just agreeing with me, boy bands have always been a thing, and kpop is just another form of that. Another subculture of koreaboos have spawned from it though, which attracts broken people desperate for an out from the west where they were rejected. 
>>72974724

--- 72974744

Koreaboos are mental, they aren't like the girls that like *insert western boyband here* . 
The whole Kpop thing works on very dangerous parasocial experiences that turn the singers and the support to their careers into a emotionally manipulative strategy to milk the fans. 
The people who fall for it have really big emotional issues

First, you assume out of nowhere that I post racebaits. Where are the racebaits? if there are even, why do you think I take part in them.
Second, you call me obsessively coping, and yet here you are poisoning a thread with unnecessary postings.
--- 72974914
Is anyone here actually "insecure" and "obsessively racebaiting" as to "cope"? I know I haven't, and for the K-postings that I've seen here, most have only mild talking points at most (granted, I've just gotten back from a 4chan-hiatus).

K-Pop is honestly so based. My sister got depressed one time, and I suggested her to check out this K-Pop thing since it was the rage within the girls in my school. Next thing I realize, her life got brightened up by it, she has K-Pop as an enjoyable pastime, and she can safely release sexual tension jerking off to Korean men. At least this way, no one can make use of her youth and puberty-induced high sex drive to manipulate her; she can just vent those feelings to K-Pop.

I'm happy for her, bros.

Stop trying to project ur narrow ideologies and worldviews onto a country that has been Homogenous for thousands of years that JUST recently opened its door to the world.

This is exactly what i mean when i said White whores and tranny faggots are spreading their ghey ass fag ideologies onto Korea while traveling here.
This is the con of pussy.

Yea its great we get more recognition from chicks, but now they infiltrated korean society and spreading their cumskin ideas to kimchi bitches.

Kim Soo Hyun has acted opposite some seriously beautiful Korean actresses. But he always looks bored and like he is ignoring him. When he did a photoshoot with Kaya in 2012 he got really flustered and shy, and admitted she was his ideal type. That was cute and first time I saw his composure get interrupted. She hit the wall after that pretty hard though, so it wasnt going to work out. Once you go Korean you cant go back.

no i'm just an another south korean boy
i know i can have as many western or asian girlfriends as if i want
but i have no desire to date koreaboos for that reason
they are sure to fit me in there with their korean boyfriend fantasies built up with kdrama and kpop
and i know they just love my country, culture, not me
even if not me, someone better-looking than me in my country will replace me

Its fake news fanfiction made up by wishful whores. They got rejected by Korean men and resort to false rape allegations.

Well that's because you slant eyed racebaiters have the decency to argue back, everyone else just post the thread and fuck off back to r*ddit or whatever they came from not even bothering to look at the replies.

What the fuck are you on about you deranged little spastic? It was a compliment, you guys at least respond and argue in your own threads, the others can't even be fucked to look at the thread after posting it. Relax, take a deep breath.

Come back when your birthrates reach at least 1
--- 72979062
>>72978972
European birth rates are even lower than that, they just get raised by immigrants and Muslims. Norway for instance only has a population of 5.5 million. Out of that, nearly a million of them are immigrants and refugees.

I'm sorry little ladyboy, but my country has birthrates of 1.6 with basically no immigrants.
Meaning that our men are twice as fuckable and popular by women when compared with soi korean "men".
It's just math and science, and numbers don't lie.
I hope you understand, nothing personal.

That 1 million figure covers both immigrants and their descendants, which includes the 2nd and 3rd generation ones with birth rates more or less equal to the native population. Muslim immigrants and their descendants are 350k of that 1 million, which is not enough to double the birth rates for the entire country.

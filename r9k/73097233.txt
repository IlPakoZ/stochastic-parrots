Why does he hate you so much? Have you talked to him?

you think I didn't tried?
This fucking faggot tried to say that my morning greetings offended him but he's obviously just trying to beat the biggest one in the workplace as a newbie and gain status and shit seeing how he is still doing this after I cut most human contact with him
I know, some goofy fucking villian shit but yeah, I can't bargain with him in any ways

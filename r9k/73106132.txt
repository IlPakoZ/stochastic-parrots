How are you too embarrassed to wear a shirt but not too embarrassed to go to a con? Do you go with friends?

Dude, seriously, i still can't believe this happened. I was really expecting to just get laughed at and coming back home feeling like a loser.

I didn't call any of my friends because they are the reason i'm embarrassed of being into anime. I went on my own.

Well, i'm used to being around the kind of people who think anime is for losers. So that's why.

I'm pulling up to my friend's wedding rehearsal in a few months wearing an anime girl shirt. I hope one of the bridesmaids is a weeb.

Not at all. I live in Brazil, and though anime is pretty popular here, everyone in my social circle still have a bad notion of it. I guess i'm just unlucky

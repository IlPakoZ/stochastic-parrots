Would you be too embarrassed to date a girl who dresses like this in public?
--- 72976392
>>72976350 (OP)
No, I'd be cool with dating pretty much any woman between the ages of 18 and 50. Unorthodox fashion would be a relatively trivial detail compared to the amount of defects I'm OK with embracing.

>>72976350 (OP)
It would kinda put me off, but I don't think it would be a real sticking point for me.
--- 72976460
>>72976350 (OP)
I think it looks cute. All women should dress like that. I would demand her to wear these clothes all the time.
--- 72976511
>>72976350 (OP)
No but I'd look very drab by comparison
--- 72976532
>>72976350 (OP)
No. When I'm with someone I'm comfortable with my usually strong social inhibitions completely disappear.
--- 72976698
>>72976350 (OP)
I'm not a big fan of the sweet style, my gf already dresses in lolita and I dress to match her with old style formal fashion.
--- 72976732
>>72976350 (OP)
lolita is so cute, i wish i had girl friends who wore lolita &lt;/3 i wear hime clothing
--- 72976746
>>72976350 (OP)
Absolutely not. I think is cute as hell, especially if the dresses have poofy skirts.
--- 72976762
>>72976350 (OP)
The other day I had to do a group assignment in uni with a girl that dresses like this. I didn't think it was weird and nobody around seemed to mind.
--- 72976778
>>72976350 (OP)
Depends a lot on her fashion sense
--- 72976787
>>72976350 (OP)
i wanna dress like this but im nervous about what boys think

hime fashion is awesome
post some of your clothes
--- 72976818
>>72976350 (OP)
i doubt i want that around me 24/7 but i'd definitely want to fuck one of these chicks.
i'm not sure how to go about it.
--- 72976824
>>72976787
boys think they look cute
any boy that think it's weird is a turbo normie and it's good you ran them out using your clothes
--- 72976825
>>72976350 (OP)
>embarrassed
No. I'd actually like that look. 
But I would not recommend it, I highly doubt she would like the attention or be safe in my enriched shithole.
--- 72976831
Otome > lolita
--- 72976852
>>72976787
I get intimidated whenever I see a cute girl wearing a cute dress.
--- 72976855
>>72976350 (OP)
This would be nothing but a positive as I'd rather she dress like this than a gutter slag, irrespective of the fact that I think it looks nice as well. Also why would I be embarrassed of what someone else is wearing?
--- 72976867
>>72976831
never heard of otome fashion what is that?
--- 72976889
>>72976809

>dont dare to selfpost because of ban hammer
The jannies never enforce this rule. Say the truth, which is that you don't want another seagull to post you in the ita thread for posting on r9k
--- 72977082
No because lolitas are cool as fuck
You should add me right NOW if you're a lolita weeb

--- 72977107
>>72977051
jannies definitely enforce it, and why would i be posted in the ita thread when i dont even dress in lolita? i dress in himekaji &amp; ryousangata (which cgl hates/knows nothing about)
--- 72977129
>>72977107
>which cgl hates/knows nothing about)
where do i go to learn more and to find stuff to buy? asking for my gf
--- 72977161

>selfpost bc i dont wanna get the banhammer
The rule has always been about posting your face, genius, no one gets banned for posting their body.
--- 72977198
what race do lolitas tend to be? the only american ones i see tend to be asian
--- 72977202
>>72977129
idk desu, the stuff im into (and post) is all older and no longer sold anymore. the clothes i own, ive gotten by spending a lot of time searching secondhand sites, sometimes paying scalper prices bc they dont make clothes like that anymore. id say just follow liz lisa on instagram and go from there

>>72977161
idc, i dont wanna post myself anyways

--- 72977562
It would help me stop fapping to lolis if I could fap to her instead
--- 72977593
The fuck? No. Is this a bait thread?
--- 72977635
>>72977593
Every single post on this fucking board is bait. Fuck this place, fuck this website, FUCK THIS GAY EARTH.

Anon.

Objectively this is extremely weird. They look like they're in their mid 20s/early 30s but they're dressing like a 4 year old. It's creepy and the attraction here is the implied naivety which makes you look even creepier.

Social approval cucks are amusing.
--- 72978399
I would kill for a girl that dress like this to be with me.

Imagine having a cute jirai kei gf

if you are constantly wondering what you're doing wrong and why everyone always thinks you're strange, you're probably just ugly and have a weird face. As a sub5 male anything you do is going to be cringe

That's a solid observation but it goes deeper. For example, if I think about the weird guys in uni, they always do and say stuff that's objectively weird.
The normal, good-looking and somewhat dull guys simply don't do any of that. They would certainly get away with more, but they just don't do it in the first place.
I'm trapped in the middle. Just normal enough to cringe at the autismos on campus but no real shot at a rich social life either. 
At least the truly weird people can lean into it. Make music. Draw. Join a certain scene or niche, or whatever.

Sure they do. There's a lot of objectively cringe stuff being said here but the guys saying it are normal to above average. There's a guy wearing a flamingo helmet.

Is there like a list of "essential" media (games, anime, manga, TV shows, movies, comics, books etc.) that everyone should play, read, watch that's regularly updated? Or individual lists or charts for every media I've listed.

just go to the most mainstream sites for each
>wiki best-selling games
>MAL for anime and manga
>imdb for TV shows and movies
>wiki best selling comics
>wiki best selling books
then again books are far too many, you'll never read all the mainstream ones even if you live 200 years, you need to pick a certain genre or field at least

Plenty of those. Go on the appropriate boards and ask--or if they're supperior (i.e. /lit/), check their wiki.

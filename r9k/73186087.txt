Social media and internet used to be apolitical (besides mockery mems) until globalists introduced identity politics. Just compare social media posts before and after 2012-2014 to see what I mean.

This here is still as good as it gets in term of free speech ... but that I'm getting banned and blocked because I'm talking about being sick from the vakseen is a disgrace for 4chan.

It's a hundred times easier to be a woman than a man in any Western country. All they have to do for a comfy life is wait at the finish line and fuck a winner. Men actually have to make themselves into a winner, which becomes harder every year.

For the women who think wagecuckoldry is empowering and liberating they are constantly handheld by the government and corporations, usually at the expense of men. The entire education system is set up for how girls learn best instead of how boys learn best, there are countless scholarships set aside for women only especially in fields like STEM which fucks over men hard and women get diversity points when job hunting or when promotions are handed out. When men made up 60% of undergrads society decided that was a national crisis and Congress passed legislation to help women. Today women make up 60% of undergrads and rising. Not a single fucking thing will be done to help us. If you point that out you're an incel Nazi bigot misogynist, while women are given plenty of attention and sympathy to air their endless trivial grievances.

I could keep going on about other ways women have it easier, but that's the biggest one. Women can pick what they do with their lives. They can be a housewife. They can work, which indirectly makes it that much harder for men to reach the finish line because there is never a push to get women into shitty jobs like garbageman or roofing, just the best and comfiest male-dominated jobs. If women fail at working the housewife fallback is always there. In the past they at least had to be a healthy weight and not too much of a bitch but even that bar has been removed for women nowadays. For men, unless you're born into money your choices are wagecucking or NEETdom which eventually turns into homelessness or suicide. Women can treat their entire life like a cute little board game without any serious consequences while it's a nonstop struggle with life and death stakes for men.

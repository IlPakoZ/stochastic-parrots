If your being genuine anon and not doing a LARP, let me give you some advice. 
Fucking leave, do not allow BPD bitches to pretend they will kill themselves to manipulate you. After years of emotional and physical abuse, I forced myself to leave a woman who did all the same things. She screamed, made false claims, gossiped and acted like she could take away my daughter but guess what, she never killed herself. 

I am free and the emotional weight of an Atlas Stone has now been lifted from my shoulders. I pray you do the same.

I mean I did say that i wouldnt want that to be true
She also says that im saving her and all of that which idk
>>73161881
Its not like she screams or anything or even threatens suicide

Its always darkest before the dawn my man. 
The hardest is getting past the barriers of your fears about what she's saying. She'll bitch and cry for a few weeks before slowly realising you don't want anything to do with her. She'll find some other orbiter to abuse and you will feel amazing freedom. 

Don't make excuses for her behavior, its wrong, leave her.

I mean i dont want to break up with her it just hurts that she says things like that

If she's saying shit like that you've already got a BPD bitch incoming. If she's saying shit like that she has no self-worth or respect and will be a total nutcase.

>>73188393 (OP)
I've accepted I was a volcel since the day I turned down a hot girl cause she had one kid and I always turn down and ghost fatties
--- 73188434
>>73188393 (OP)
I had sex around an hour ago. Am I an incel?
--- 73188449
>>73188393 (OP)
I'm an incel, I have sex a lot too
--- 73188461
>>73188414
You were definitely always a normalfaggot lol.
>>73188434
You've been close to sex xd.
>>73188449
How are you an incel unless they're all rape victims or it's involved with prostitution?
--- 73188485
>>73188393 (OP)
Ive never been rejected because I don't have the social skills to get anywhere near that stage
--- 73188496
>>73188485
Do you even try to talk to women?
--- 73188498
ok i'll be incel after my next rejection, which is probably impending
--- 73188513
>>73188393 (OP)
>including rape
Why not? Rape is sex.
--- 73188519
>>73188496
I'll say words and throat noises at them and it doesnt really make a conversation. Sometimes Ill stand silent nodding my head 
I wouldnt go as far as calling it a "talk"
--- 73188534
>>73188498
10 is a bare minimum count that means you've at least given it a small attempt to find a gf. The fact that almost every """in"""cel here can't meet that minuscule threshold shows how small of an issue the "incel problem" really is.
>>73188513
It makes the term "incel" useless if we include rape/prostitution/sex with men (though if you're into men that'd count, but if so then you can't be an incel, regardless, in basically all situations).
>>73188519
So you're not really trying at all.
--- 73188537
>>73188393 (OP)
>>you've been rejected less than 10 times
This doesn't make sense. If you have rejected you would have thought someone liked you or you had a chance with them. Why do you need to be rejected?
--- 73188551
>>73188534
>So you're not really trying at all.
When I try I say nothing at all. Nothing comes to mind when I try to interact with a woman and I stand there silent. Words only happen when I am distracted and the words aren't even relevant to the conversation. I laugh a lot
--- 73188554
>>73188393 (OP)
True and you also can't be an incel if you don't try to date and have sex with men.
--- 73188561
>>73188534
>It makes the term "incel" useless if
Damn, sounds like your term is shit then.
--- 73188587
>>73188537
If you're not getting rejected then you're not really putting yourself out there lol. Maybe that wouldn't apply if you've cold approached countless women and they won't even talk to you for more than 10 seconds, but I highly doubt that's the case for almost anyone.
>>73188551
Not relevant, but sure.
>>73188554
Ah yes, the classic "going against your sexual orientation is the same as dating women 99.99% of men easily find attractive". I really never thought of that one.
>>73188561
The caveats are very obvious to anyone with an IQ over 75. Every term in existence assumed context to understand fully, anyhow.
--- 73188592
How do people still "argue" with this faggot about this exact same topic for the past year or so?
--- 73188596
Just had sex an hour ago, sure am glad to be an incel again, not doing that again
--- 73188616
>>73188393 (OP)
Why would you want to be an incel? Retard
--- 73188619
>>73188393 (OP)

Jesus, Anon ...

>>73188592
You realize there's constant inflow and outflow on any popular 4chan board? Not everyone browses enough or browses enough of these types of threads to recognize me, as well.
>>73188596
Are you just pretending to be illiterate? lol
>>73188616
They want to wallow in self-pity despite being normalfags. It's very common on /r9k/.
>>73188619
It's far more likely that you'd be raped/sexually assaulted and still be an incel than that situation. But always having the option to go out on the streets at night and rape a woman (which is true if you're a man who has almost any amount of strength) doesn't mean inceldom isn't a real thing, also.
--- 73189180
I have sex regularly and I'm a robot. Incels are the scum of the earth. No wonder they don't get laid, what woman would want a whiny subhuman who always plays the victim.
--- 73189310
>>73189180
Robots don't have sex, ever.

>>73188393 (OP)
>you've been rejected less than 10 times
If getting ghosted counts then yes
>you wouldn't date a fat woman
Yes i love chubby/fat women, up to a certain point
>a girl has ever been into you
Yes
>you've ever been close to sex/kissing a girl (not including rape/prostitutes)
Theoretically yes, realistically no

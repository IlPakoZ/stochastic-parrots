>dyed hair
>heavy tattoos
>anime references as an "aesthetic" all over their rooms, clothes, or their bodies even though they aren't weebs
>likely a plant collector 
>likely a cat person
>is either dating a dumpy sleazy thin effeminate dude or dates another woman
>face paint levels of makeup
>not quite a normal whore but not quite an art hoe
Its like all these women are trying to be "special" in the exact same way using the exact same tricks. Is there a good word for these type of women?

Its called "animetoilet" on russian imagebroads. Idk about you guys. Anglos probably will use some more polite wording like moecore or shit.

back in the day these were called suicide girls and there was a whole magazine about them. it's not exactly what you say since suicide girls were the deathcore chicks but i feel its basically the same archetype. sounds a lot like pagan/wiccan witches personality too

This gives me hope as a blakkbot. I'm going to lose weight this summer so I can pick up these girls born in 2000 bros.

Yeah,but suicide girls were actual emo/punk/alt chicks. In gen z most of these girls aren't connected to any actual subculture.

All subcultures are dead, whether male or female oriented. The best they can hope for is a mini revival on tiktok.

you are right and this >>73112904
anon is right too. but to be honest i always felt suicide girls were kinda posers anyways. not that i met actual suicide girls but there were some wannabes in my area and they werent about the scene at all. they were about being bpd and fucking the men in the bands, but i dont think they even listened to the core

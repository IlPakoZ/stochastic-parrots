these girls are at least 6.5 out of 10 to all indian / black / arab / asian men because they are young + white meat.............

You're either mentally ill or delusional to think these girls are over a 3/10

Girl on the left is making an odd expression and it's hard to tell how she usually looks.

We're talking facial features here, get out with your disgusting boobs

Round face? Slanty eyes?
--- 73004477
>>73003610
so round eyes on women are unattractive? bummer. I also resemble left more, but i'm not as attractive because my face is asymmetrical and my hairline is masculine (not rounded).

For me its the ginger phenotype
--- 73004546
>>73003712
nope, just less sharply angled facial bones.
--- 73004606
I like the big cheekbone small chin combo. Small nose is nice too.

Most white girls have awful facial features DESU, the only thing they have going for them is colored eyes.

Do you think women, especially feminists and whatnot ever have a moment of clarity, where they consider the rampancy of "misogyny" all throughout human history, and think maybe it's us, maybe it's women who are the problem because we're just fucking awful?

There was no "misogyny" all throughout human history, men never hated women and still don't what we had was chauvinism and that's because men are superior to women.

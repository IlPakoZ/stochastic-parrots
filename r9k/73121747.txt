yeah, and they are wrong sadly. im not saying can't be great but they are not worth figuring it out. the dudes here should focus on strengthening or getting relationships with male friends. also focus on goals, or things that are attainable and bring them joy. women do not want to be the primary reason for a persons happiness, they hate that shit. all that will do is make these men feel worse about themselves which sucks since they are already miserable as is.

That's true, but that doesn't mean having a gf can't make someone happy, especially if they are romantically starved. There's a reason the number one ingredient most anons have in 'making it' is finally getting a gf or at least having sex. Recognizing how important romantic success is to happiness isn't the same as idealizing women or simping

You have a very different life experience to most anons then. The number one complaint of miserable anons most of the time is a lack of romantic success. Even asexual anons hate that they can't have that
--- 73122199
>>73122148
never said it can't male someone happy, just that it's not worth the effort. women are not worth it 9/10 times just like men aren't. the people here really have no clue how annoying or stressful a relationship can be. this again, applies to both genders, but is harder for men. dudes simply don't get as many opportunities on average as women in the west. the difference is actually laughable. they should focus on what i said and on their family as well. if a women comes along and is worth their time, great. chasing girls, changing themselves to get one and continuing the act is exhausting and most times not worth the rto. women are not special, billions of them are on this planet just like men.
--- 73122210
>>73122199
You're not wrong, but you're imagining a relationship where the guy is essentially an actor to maintain attraction. I'm not saying anons should so that. They should become the best version of themselves, which is kind of what you're suggesting via getting their shit together, then find a girl they have legitimate synergy with. Personality synergy is massively underrated, especially here, in terms of having a happy and fulfilling relationship
--- 73122220

If I'd just authentically BEE MYSELF I would end up crying in front of the girl and that would ruin the relationship. You have to be an actor. If you cry in front of your girl her respect for you GOES DOWN no matter what you think
--- 73122281
>>73122220
>guys need to feel like what you are doing is right to only get rugpulled in the feefees like this
You're not wrong. One of the biggest wakeup calls of my life was doing all the 'right things' to a girl I liked and having it backfire terribly. Sadly all the feminist horseshit that young boys are brainwashed with means such a negative experience is inevitable for millions of boys and men, many of them never realize the delusion they were under since they are either mentally weak and/or heavily conditioned, others become embittered. Ironically women also suffer indirectly from this because feminism trains men to act in ways which they don't find attractive. Contemporary feminism is a scourge to humanity
--- 73122282
>>73122210
>They should become the best version of themselves,
im not suggesting that at all. im not saying self improve or any of that bs. im litearlly saying these men should just do what makes them happy. find people who are reliable, (hopefully strong male relationships as it's far easier) focus on their family (mom, dad, siblings, cousins young and old etc.) and pursue shit that makes them happy (could be learning an instrument, going to concerts, sports or the gym. literally could be learning to cook meals they enjoy to feed themselves or their loved ones. maybe it's growing a garden or some other thing) just forget women as they literally most times aren't worth shit. i wish these men would realize this instead of being angry and bitter about not having a polished turd. i want to make sure im clear, this applies to both genders with regards to romantic success who are disadvantaged. if shit was easy, maybe pursue it then. i know enough good looking dudes who don't bother with them, even when they have women throwing themselves at them. same shit applies to hot girls too so some truth to what i say has to be there.
--- 73122296
>>73122273
It's not a binary between bee urself or be an actor. Self monitoring is a gray scale, not a binary. Not to mention the more emotionally stable and successful you become, the less emotional distress you'll be under. 

Not self monitoring at all is not the same thing as beeing urself, this is one of the most common fallacies. Even Chads and normies self monitor, in fact many of them do it a lot (too much imo). 
>>73122282
That's the next best thing if you can't or don't want a romantic relationship. You sound more bitter and jaded than aromantic or asexual. Don't project your bitterness onto other people or convince them that one of the parts of life with the most potential for happiness and fulfillment is a waste of time. Love is worth pursuing, even if it can be painful or end poorly
--- 73122302
>>73122273
>You have to be an actor
I agree. Notice how women will drop a guy over the smallest mistake, men have no choice but to mold themselves into the model that women find most attractive. There is some degree of flexibility, but generally its a game of playing your part right like an actor and not making any mistakes with your lines.
--- 73122329
>>73122296
cut the shit with projecting and whatever other buzzwords you want to use. im literally telling dudes here to try to be happy here by pursuing things they have more control over and are reliable (on average to be fair). focusing their efforts on friends, family and hobbies is not harmful. i even mention that if someone comes along, great. you are suggesting they do things dependent on a girls happiness which is terrible advice.

Most of your advice is good except for the part about giving up on romance and girls, which is egregiously bad advice. Being fatalist or having a hands off attitude towards something that significant is a recipe for suffering, especially because most anons are passive and not attractive.

this is where i actually agree with you. without happiness or people, live is not worth living. you believe that the pinnacle of this is found in a relationship with a partner. that nothing on earth can compare and that a person should slave away their existence to this. i think it's foolish and that you should let it come into your life if it's someone special.

Here's just one example: In general, women prefer men taller than themselves and, conversely, men prefer women shorter than themselves [11], [24]-[26]. Again, preferences are reflected in pairings as the male-taller norm is also found in actual couples. Gillis and Avis (1980) found that in only 1 out of 720 US/UK couples, the female was taller

Non-survey, no women or men were asked for their preferences. Shows that women far prefer a plain or ugly man with a good personality to a handsome but boring man.
>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22329089/
To women facial appearance and height are much less important than social status, self-confidence, and personality
>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655646/
Only the ugliest 10% and handsomest 5% of teenaged boys noticed any difference in sexual behavior In adulthood facial appearance only mattered for the men in poor health
>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29534596/
Self-confidence, personality, determine a man's sexual success, not his facial attractiveness

Yes, absolutely true. A majority of women exhibit a preference for taller men, and so on.
But it is not all women. And it is not absolute. 

>tell me how the study is wrong, you're super smart after all
Sure!
Gillis and Avis, from 42 years ago, did not have access to better data.
The study mention here
>https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-its-so-rare-for-a-wife-to-be-taller-than-her-husband/272585/
And found here
>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054186
Which directly references Gillis and Avis, BTW, shows that in the UK a hair over 4% of couples have the woman taller than the man.
1 in 24, not 1 in 720.
Other studies, easily accessed from the main article as links, also show that somewhere between 1 in 12 and 1 in 24 couples have a taller woman.
Not NEARLY as dire, is it?
So tell me - WHY are you referring to a 42 year old study that has been superseded by much more recent ones?

I bet cash you never opened any of those studies, you immediately focused on ME and tried to paint ME as "bad".
Why?
Because then *you* don't have to grow and change.
>no person who wants to genuinely help would enjoy these reactions from someone lost.
Why not?
If your goal is to save innocent people from idiots, fools, and demoralizers you know you are doing well when the idiots, fools, and demoralizers are pissed off at you. The fact that blackpillers froth at the mouth at my posts and talk about me *instead of the facts* tells me they can't refute anything.
It tells everyone else that, too,
Replies like yours prove to obverses that you have no ability to refute facts but must instead attack me.
It is funny because it is an admission that you already lost, but you lack the insight to know that.

Didn't expect this thread to blow up, I'll quickly break down the main things I think matter in how you make a woman feel... 

>looks 
This one is self explanatory, and most robots are well aware of this to the point that they overly harp on it, every person who wants love should looksmaxx. Before you get bitter and screech 'that isn't love', do you imagine an ugly girl when you think of love? 
>personality 
This is the element that robots egregiously underestimate. Due to a combination of mental illness, poor mentality, external locus of control, bitterness etc. many robots have completely dogshit personalities. THIS is the real reason most robots are alone. Before oyu seethe and sperg out, I'm not saying that the average robot is good or even average looking. I'm saying that after you've looksmaxxed, the only thing realistically left in your control after that is personality, which is much more powerful than most anons realize. Most are too anxious to let go of their self defeating mentality though and would rather stay in their safe space which tells them the only thing that matters is something they have little to no control over. 
>status/money 
This one is pretty self explanatory, should be pretty self explanatory. I'd caution against heavily leaning on this and against totally ignoring it.

>If your goal is to save innocent people from idiots, fools, and demoralizers you know you are doing well when the idiots, fools, and demoralizers are pissed off at you.
that is a really poor method to measure success. again, this is what you enjoy and what gets your rocks off. you have the right to live your life however you want.

Freindo, I was here long before the get on the floor stories. I remember when /r9k/ was mainly humor and decent advice for young men on how to get a GF. I was the guy that started the beta uprising posts (true story).
It was the invsion of shills for PUA and Game that ruined the place. The transformation from good humor, good camaraderie, and creativity was when the shills started dropping redpill threads every 4 hours, then it was the anti-improve threads every day, and now if you try to start a GBP or infinite apartment or tendies thread it dies because everyone is busy screeching about how their dick is only 152mm, not 153mm so they will die alone.

You summed it up much better than I could. Neuroticism is the number one trait among robots which dries pussies up. It makes women feel even more unsafe than being with a guy shorter than them, that's why they have such an intense reaction of disgust against it. Many robots also confuse neuroticism with sensitivity, they are probably somewhat correlated, but there's a difference between opening up to a woman like a retard, and opening up to her in a realistic and chilled way

The only worse thing than dying is giving up and living a soulless existence. It's much better to try, potentially fail, and learn for the future than to never leave the nest like so many intensely anxious anons do. The main thing I'd say is that it's better to have a good, sustainable relationship than a great relationship that isn't sustainable or enjoyable since you have to self monitor so hard or because the natuarl synergy isn't strong enough. Not saying that's the case, but that's a mistake I used to make in the past, forcing things under the illusion that more will power automatically meant better results. Sometimes the best course of action is to let a relationship die because there are better girls out there, or at least girls you'd have better synergy with

Well, it is true that women can kind of smell desperation/when a guy is somewhere only to try to talk to women. Have you tried to simply befriend a woman? If you have the social skills necessary for that, you should be good to go.

My point is, women can be pretty defensive around men, so maybe try having a more platonic/less threatening attitude, so they're more likely to open up. I'm not saying it's easy to befriend women as a guy who's on the introverted side and probably not very experienced with women, but it's a good starting point.

Nta, but ironically your biggest problem is how much you want it. You probably don't realize how much of a desperate or overly intense vibe you're giving off. Women can like intensity, but especially if they don't know you well or you don't' have social proof to you, t hen don't know how to interpret intensity in a vacuum since you're an unknown quantity to them. So they usually just play it safe and stay away. Basically imo your biggest problem is your neuroticism, you need to chill and unironically not try as hard to make women like you, and even though that sounds dumb it will probably work better than what you're doing now
--- 73125745
>>73125676
it's hardly gaslighting when people tell you that there are no shortcuts with social skills. you are a person that hates women but also wants women to love you. you don't have any genuine interest in socializing, but the advice is that you need to have an interest in socializing to get the benefits of socializing (unless you are a chad, but even chad usually enjoys spending quality time with people)

This doesn't mean anything. You are a victim of a feedback loop, which can work both ways and you can eventually be mentally drained by spending time alone if you wanted that. That definition of introvert was created by some greedy young whore, and you can still be interested in things that "drain" you. Let's not skip the fact that many of these lonely cuckolds legitimately do not care about women nor trust them, they simply want the physical touch and status of being in a relationship. That can work if you're Goku or Naruto, but sadly you just have to take the L if your not.

Deceive was probably an overgeneralization, but in general women who feel good when they are being flirted with by dark triad men were selected for.

I'm giving them a lot of benefit of the doubt because bitterness is a slippery slope to misery and mistreating the people around you. Giving people the benefit of the doubt opens you up to getting taken advantage of, but also vastly increases the chances of meeting other people who are genuinely good, or are at least trying to be. I'd rather get hurt 100 times to find a good girl than be an emotional coward and close myself off because my ego is too big and misconstrues trust with ignorance. 

There's also this misconception that men and women are the same. If you have the same expectations of women that you have of men, you will inevitably be disappointed. Women have different priorities and find different things attractive than men, they are also under way less environmental pressure in 2023 to be good people than men. Lastly, they are much more susceptible to leaning on and giving into their subconscious than men, both by nature and nurture. I guess I'd rather be made a fool of and eventually find good relationships than let my ego force me into isolation so I can feel superior to other people when in reality I'm just being a massive, selfish pussy

I kind of agree with you but I just said that normie tactics is so funny to me.

I just ask myself how on earth is it possible that girls cannot sense when someone is rapist, killer, drug dealer etc. and other shitty personality traits even after months of dating and going out with that person.

On the other hand they can somehow sense when a guy is le desperate on one sentence alone or just by few minutes of his presence in the same room with them.

You can srsly tell me you believe this.

Or you maybe think that traits mentioned above are actually part of a good personality; that's much bigger issue then.

Nta, but women are way less empathetic than men, there is a fallacy that they are as or even more empathetic because they have a much stronger nurturing reflex than men. They also don't have to give people the benefit of the doubt because they are so much more likely to 'naturally' get good relationships with the opposite sex, especially in 2023. Basically women suck because they can, both in terms of cultural/hypermodern environment, and because of the evolutionary past shaping their nature differently than men. The fallacy that women have even close to the same level of empathy to men is honestly very dangerous to society in general, especially because they have so much political power now

You DO realize the post you are replying to *has links to the scientific studies that support it*, right?
Right?

depends. its all anecdotal really. all the woman i've met in my life were pretty nice to me, but any time i hop on the internet/social media women just seem insane. social media is a cancer

>>73126276
>they don't have relationships
yes and why is that? 

If the asnwers are something like
>they have le bad attitude
or
>women le sense ther desperation and personality

don't even bother replaying.

>>73125559
Oh! You are as bad an vocab as you are at science!
The "lost" was that you made a tacit admission and didn't realize it.
> i literally pointed out how you enjoy making others miserable
No, retard, I like how evil people like you seethe so hard at the truth.

Yawn. Tell me again how no man under average height ever get laid?
--- 73126326
Seeing men insist on the "blackpill" being true is so funny because all they do is project their own instincts (physical attractiveness trumps everything) onto women. They are literally incapable of imagining how it would be to not be shallow for one second
--- 73126327
>>73126277
Bullshit answer, you deflected my question with a question and parroted what I told you back at me when pressed.
Why are you really here? What do you get out of your time on this board?
--- 73126328
>>73126306
The women in my life have been ice cold bitches, so hopefully I am proven wrong in the future. I suspect empathy for women is more selfishly motivated than for men where it's more reflexive and good natured imho. Men can also shape their empathy to be more effective where women just usually go with their gut, which can backfire, especially in macro settings where instincts shaped in very specific hunter gatherer settings are not as useful
--- 73126332
>>73126327
Not a bullshit answer. Calm down retard.
--- 73126340

Why do you deflect even the most basic of questions? Is the english language too complex for your normnigger brain to process?

--- 73126342
>>73126326
Half true, personality matters more than women realize. I see a similar fallacy in career women who assume having a successful career should entitle them to similarly attractive men. The vast majority of men only care about looks and personality desu

>Men prefer women with big tits
The Femcel Blackpillers
>"IF YOU HAVE A B CUP OR LESS YOU WILL DIE ALONE!"
Men prefer short women
The Femcel Blackpillers
>"ANY WOMAN 5'9" OR TALLER WILL DIE ALONE!"
Now male blackpillers will scream this isn't true for HOURS despite the fact that appearance is much more important to men than to women.
Yes, there is a general preference in a slight majority.
You guys act like it is an iron law and death sentence.
THAT is the funny part.

Well, they aren't that smart. They lack the ability to imagine someone not thinking just like themselves.
I mean, read this thread. The blackpill types are *literally* incapable of imaging an existence unlike their own except some sort of mythical demi-god Chad who is less real than Superman.
They are incapable of imagining what it is like to be a confident *man*, how the Hell can the imagine what a woman might think like?!

Just because Jesus turned water into wine once doesn't mean its a common occurrence.

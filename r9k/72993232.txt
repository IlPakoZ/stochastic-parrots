What do you think about Musk's theory of virtue signaling? Have there been any scientific investigations which back up or refute the theory?

--- 72993237
>>72993236
Yes made clear that twitter does not want to be used for child porn. Not sure if that means he thinks it should be illegal but that would be inline with his stated (though not always consistent) belief that anything legal should be allowed on twitter.
--- 72993238
>>72993237
Yeah he obviously just doesn't want illegal stuff on his website, but that doesn't necessarily mean he agrees that a photo of a naked kid on your computer should be able to get you arrested and on the sex offender's list.

Right, I'm the one making it a political issue. Not all the Republican politicians and Christian youth group leaders who uniltaterally labelled a marginalised group "groomers" in order to push through legislation and were then caught fucking kids themselves.

The interpretation as virtue signalling is wrong. It's a class marker. People proudly display their pronouns on Twitter because it signals allegiance to the dominant class' ideology. It's a signal of cultural capital. That's why these things are always a bit dumb or based on bullshit: they are popular *because* they are easy to attack. This way, lower-class people push back against it, and it makes it clear that they are not part of the elite.

It not signalling virtue for virtue, it's signalling virtue as a legitimizing myth for the ruling class to stay in power.

No, child castration is the literal chemical and/or surgical mutilation of children and by extension the industry that normalizes it and pushes it on children. If it was a myth then there'd be no reason for tranny terrorists to mow down children in retaliation when it gets banned.

Terrible argument but I might be convinced to allow it if you admit that the cis white hetero-patriarchy is 100% real and the source of all societal ills. After all, if it were a myth, there'd be no reason for incel terrorists to mow down children in retaliation when it is chipped away at ever so slightly.

The only one trying to politicize stuff are right wingers like yourself who refuse to respect other people and who are obsessed with spreading disinformation and trolling. The majority of the public disagrees with you and sees you as ignorant and hateful. You're just a hateful, angry incel loser. Maybe you would not be so bitter if you weren't a lazy white trash incel who sits in his moms basement all day blaming minoirites and liberals for why he can't live a normal life.

this is why you cant argue with people who are mentally ill. All they do is project and deny reality and create their own reality

All partisanship is an attempt to rationalize emotional and self serving thinking. The right as you see it and the left as opposite partisans see it are complete fabrications within your own minds.
You desire control over others, know that you have not the merit to demand this, and try to legitimize it using your ideology.
I look forward to which type of heretic you attempt to paint me as.

Whatever matey. Normal people don't have a problem with sex ed in school. It's only you uptight conservatard christcucks who have this retarded self-hatred for certain parts of their body or which gender their brain tells them to find hot. Which is why normal people enjoy life while you're a troon-obsessed virgin who can't even find an ugly 1/10 whale to stick his ED-ridden dick into. :*

No they didn't. Did you click the link or copy and paste it? Because you can clearly see the active link is not the whole link he posted, this happened because moot apparently coded space delimiters in the code and when it hit a space it thought the link had ended.

From personal experience I find it to be true. It's pretty much the normie mainstream form of a-logging. However, it seems to be most effective if it's a company or organization doing it since there is a diffusion of responsibility. Ever thought of why random shitty startups lean so hard into the #woke (hashtag intentional) virtue signalling despite being known for having a frathouse...sorry I meant """fun""" work environment? It's so that when the faggots eventually breaks one of their employees, especially from a marginalized group, their account will be immediately discredited, saving the company brand. After all, how can such a progressive company act like...that??? I mean just look at their twatter, there's just no way...

An interesting theory, but I doubt people look into their use of displaying their pronouns any further than "I want to show allegiance for my friends and those who are marginalised so that I can be liked by them", therefore while it could work as a "marker", it's not necessarily the intention of it in the first place, which is what it sounds like you meant.

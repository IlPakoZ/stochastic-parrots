Why do British people switch to American accents when they sing?

they dont. (some) americans just already speak close to the sound of how people sing. most americans speak strange regional accents though, you're just thinking of the media american accent

the beatles sang in american accents because the music they were originally taught to rip off was American. and they were so big that that did the deal. nowadays if you sing in a british accent you're usually gonna come across as either knees-up-mother-brown, oi-oi-skinhead or that faggot Damon Albarn. this doesn't go for black people music obviously

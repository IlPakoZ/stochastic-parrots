To Women,

I resent you. My pain is inconsequential to you. Especially the pain you directly cause. You feel ENTITLED to kindness that you can't reciprocate. I want you to know that you never deserved the goodwill and special treatment you got in life. All forgiveness and kindness you've had was not just a gift, but a gross injustice to the people you demanded it be deprived from. Your soul is actually made of dirt.

do normalfags think it's fine when a girl talks about her sex life? like if she randomly starts talking about how she's good at blowjobs or that she fucked some dude the other day. i find it a little weird. wouldn't women get weirded out if some dude said he fucked some girl real good?

Who cares? Turn it into funny conversations.
>Oh, you're good at blowjobs? My dad always told mom I was. What's your favorite part? Personally, I love the taste.

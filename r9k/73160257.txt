Watching wagies wageslave for 17 hours in denial misery actually alleviates my depression and helps me go on.

I mean if he's the owner and he's doing this he probably just enjoys his work

>>73160267
>enjoys his work
eyah no, he's just dead inside, but shit just makes me cope for some reason.
--- 73160287
>>73160272
I think you're just projecting your own feelings onto him
--- 73160333
>>73160272
There's almost no reason for a restaurant to stay open that long other than the owner having the funds to do so, but more importantly, the will to even do it. So yes its likely done out of enjoyment rather than necessity

Working retail is kinda comfy actually. It's a great job if you can live on $15/hr. No responsibility, you can fuck off for 70% of your shift, nobody expects anything good, most of the week it's dead, and you can reap some gibs.

if only this was true, but i worked that shit and it's far from true. you're getting bullied right and left. shit's not fun at all.

Wish this was the case everywhere. I worked at Target a few years back and the manager was constantly scrolling through cams to watch us work. Stood still for too long, you're in the office getting chewed out. Going over your break time, not doing your job, getting rude with a customer, write up. It sucked.
--- 73160932
>>73160889
Work the overnight shift or the morning shift on a weekday. There's nobody fucking there. As long as you don't work register, you can disappear to the back for 30+ minutes at a time and nobody notices.

>>73160911
>Target
That's the problem shoot for WalMart as everyone there, including the managers, are already dead inside. I worked at Sams Club at it was pretty great if you didn't work weekends or register.

I work at a dispensary now. I loved all the perks (test strains to give feedback, got to take home past-shelf life buds, hanging out with cool people) but now I don't really like smoking, and it alienated me from the people there. Looking for another job currently

>got to take home past-shelf life buds
old herb allegedly converts into some sleep inducing tranquilizer barely any creativity stimulating effects, is that rue?
--- 73160985
>>73160959
Really depended on the strain and how dry it got, after so long the buds get really really sticky and then suddenly go super dry. At both of those stages it's basically unsmokeable and belongs in the trash. I used to drink a ton of monster back then too, so if it did have a stronger tendency to induce sleep I didn't let it.

>it's basically unsmokeable and belongs in the trash
wow what a retard, you could have just bakes it at 115c for 20 min and grinded it up into olive oil then drunk it with almond milk, shit's 3 times stronger than smoke for the same dose size. what a fuckin waste. could have frozen it too to last you for a decade. could have saved thousands of dollars.
--- 73161017
>>73161011

I got it for free lol
sorry I didn't feel like doing your eldritch witch doctor weed revitalization to get some mid to watch tom and jerry to.
--- 73161022
>>73160428
>1660 Super
Is that what you have? Isn't that a budget GPU? Get with the times old man.
--- 73161033
>>73161017
now that you don't get it anymore for free you could have tapped into your frozen reserves for years, and shit is far rom "mid" it's high grade shit ok? edible shit is not smoke crap, it never expires. it's only expired for hipsters with lung cancer, not for edible wizards.
--- 73161039
>>73161022
spoken like a true goy.
trust me, after 10 minutes of 4K ultra settings of the boring AAA goyslop they make these days, you won't give a shit if it's scaled down to 1080p at medium.

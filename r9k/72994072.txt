>good idea

why do financially unstable people have children? My childhood was nothing but traumatic with sprinkles of normalcy. What do you think goes through someones mind when having a child when in a bad fianancial situation? Do they think the child is somehow going to be a harvard graduate that makes the new apple and can generate generational wealth? 

someone tell me.

this is every immigrant family ever. results are mixed. some make it out, others don't. the ones that do are dragged down by family unless they cut ties. gonna have to make tough decisions.

The average parent is like the population they are drawn from: on average fucking retarded. What were you expecting? I mean it doesn't just stop at money.

looking back realizing that he most likely followed in his fathers footsteps, and didn't become the one who got away changed for the better or made it. Just another statistic, these patterns of behavior dont just magically disappear they will be perpetuated due to socioeconomic factors. You cant just ban people under a certain tax bracket from having kids or something.

Most of the time it's because they don't have access to birth control, and either their state or their religion or their culture doesn't allow access to abortions, so they're forced to keep the child

Katana Zero is good for feels.

Ruiner is good for a brutal revenge quest kinda feel.

Check out "Star Fetchers" it's really short though but it's got those feels I cant describe.

Any of the Yakuza games. Any of the Nier games. Anything Suda 51

When was the last time you cried? You probably need a good cry. Watch Blade Runner and then Blade Runner 2049 the day after.

Have you tried any fromsoft game?

If you like indie games, MVs like lone fungus (frustratingly hard platforming sections) and hollow knight (semi impossible boss rushes and a couple hard platforming sections)

In this order: Silver Case, Flower Sun and Rain, Silver Case: The 25th Ward, Killer7. This is the order for the early KTP games in the series. But these are either hit or miss people either love or hate them.

I love Suda51 &lt;3

shit, i forgot to also recommend SOMA.
--- 73194310
Omori.
Maybe try playing some coop game with an interesting person who reciprocates
But honestly there is nothing wrong with feeling nothing. I also feel nothing these days, anhedonia and the like. It is just returning back to the indifference of the universe

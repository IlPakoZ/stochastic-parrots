Most prestige jobs demand early rising 

I can do that a couple weeks then I start coming late and the office and HR starts hounding me

My office Job is hybrid and my manager and I always show up late because we just dont give a fuck. Been there almost 2 years

Op here

Having tardiness hanging over my head for the rest of my life just seems degrading and far too servile 


Do you think with seniority or years working it would lax ?

It's not a disorder, it's that the shitty wagie world is designed to mold you into a machine, not a person. They invent a new disorder whenever too many people are getting fucked up from the horrible way we're forced to live.

you need to start your own business so that you can wake up when you want

Lol no retard you either come on time or you don't. There will always be someone who wants your job, they will hold your behavior over your head. If you keep coming late everyone will ask the manager why can't they do the same so it won't be tolerated for long.
Life is fucking shit welcome to the club.

Agreed, but I still use it as a medical excuse along with diagnosed autism to not work and collect benefits. It's quite enjoyable having no bed time or wakeup time, and going to bed whenever my body feels like it, often around 4-5 A.M.

No but i also do not give a fuck about it either. I get my shit done and my boss likes me for how I contribute. I did get told once that I fell asleep at my desk which I do not even remember and my boss told me to just stay home if I am that tired. She ended up leaving though

Exactly the same. 
I come into the office at best once a week. 
The remaining days I only have to get up around 9:20 because I usually have my first meeting of the day at 9:30.

It's been 3 days now, I hope I didn't scare her away.
--- 73162514
>>73162488 (OP)
Same, but I'm going to guess that she just doesn't want to talk to me. I don't think I did anything to scare her.
--- 73162539
>>73162514
Someone you know irl? Or from here?
--- 73162565
>>73162539
From here, what about you?
--- 73162577
>>73162565
Same. I doubt it but it would be funny if it was the same person.
--- 73162589
>>73162577
Well, their alias starts with 'O' and ends with 'E'. I guess I wouldn't be too surprised if it turns out we were talking to the same person.
--- 73162612
>>73162589
Have some peace of mind, she is not the same. 
>I guess I wouldn't be too surprised if it turns out we were talking to the same person
But what gives you this idea? Did she act kinda distant? Or like if she was playing with you?
--- 73162625
>>73162488 (OP)
If a girl likes you, shes not making you wait for sex
--- 73162628
>>73162612
That's good to know at least. She was distant, yeah. She's generally pretty aloof and doesn't really share much about herself. I don't know if she was playing with me though. What makes you think you scared around the person you were talking to, OP?

Why am I cursed as a male with bpd? I had the perfect girl

I'm not looking for sex, Anon.
>>73162628
Being older and living far away from her. I like her company and want to see where it can lead (friend or more, any would be great).
>>73162640
Think what you want of me but I want to keep faith.
--- 73162701
>>73162676
Ah, in my case I'm the younger one. I enjoyed having someone who could relate to me in a lot of ways, but I don't know if they'd feel the same. I don't think I'd have anything stronger than friendship with her, if she was even interested in that still. I get the feeling she's not very interested in love or romance. I hope your anon messages sometime soon, fren.

>I'm not looking for sex
There you have the reason. You can't even admit to yourself what your true intentions are with this interaction. If you truly just wanted to be friends then why tf are you this upset about it and making threads? Admit that you wanted to fuck heR OP, that's the first step. Cause if you can't even express your true desire, how do you expect her to reciprocate those feelings? You're supposed to radiate SEX, not be afraid to even mention the word.

Well, people still have to deal with their daily life so maybe you could be honest and ask how she feels about it. It's hard to know how someone feels behind a screen and they sometimes just don't wanna bother you with their problems. I don't know how she acts, you know her better than me but it may be great to try to push things on your side instead of falling into that cold silence.
>I get the feeling she's not very interested in love or romance
Having a good friend is better than no one at all.
>I hope your anon messages sometime soon, fren.
Thanks, Anon. Same goes for you.
--- 73162775
>>73162742
I want to see where it leads. Why should it be about sex? Love, yes but why sex?
--- 73162795
>>73162755
I did try to ask her more about her life and how she felt but it was very bare or she would tell me she didn't want to talk about it. I figure it'd be better to wait a while, let her get to know me more and trust me some and then try again. Who knows if that'll happen anymore (^:.
>Having a good friend is better than no one at all.
Couldn't agree more, although I'm sure it can still hurt if you really wanted more than that.

Here's hoping, OP.
--- 73162835
>>73162775
Romantic love without lust aint shit. Everyone has sex first before they decide to fall in love.
--- 73162854
>>73162795
I think you did the best thing. Forcing her to talk early would be rude.
>although I'm sure it can still hurt if you really wanted more than that.
Sadly, yes.
I hope everything goes well, Anon.

>>73162835
Is this bait? I won't reply any further.
--- 73162874
>>73162854
It's not. Falling in love fast is portrayed in the movies as something desirable. But in real life if you catch feelings too quick as you did with this bitch, then it's a major red flag. Most people pretend it's casual lustfulness until they fuck, and then people catch feelings and start falling in love.
--- 73163062
Even if this is 4chan, I genuinely hate seeing someone calling her a bitch. Makes my blood boil.
--- 73163188
>>73163062
And this is the type of attitude that turned her off. You've known this whore for how long? You've met this slut how many times in real life? Assuming the answer to both of these questions is low, then why the fuck are you this in love? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Girls get freaked out when guys attach too soon which is 1000% what you did here. While simultaneously pretending like you didn't wanna fuck. You're a scumbag asshole and the BITCH did nothing wrong.

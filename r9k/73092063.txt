thats why you gradually lose weight and work out a lot vs rapidly losing it all. you can also see a cosmetic surgeon for losing sagging skin as well. theres no benefit to being fat vs being /fit/, guy on the right is better off and will lead a happier life after losing all of those unsightly pounds.

Despite that guy's disgusting appearance on the right his face, hair and skin will look passable once he gets the loose skin removed, not to mention he's gained some muscle which is a big bonus to average normie looking people.

It's not permanent, this guy is just retarded and didn't bother to do any research outside of what /fit/ and CICOfags told him. You can see that, "Yeah, well look at all the weight I lost. I'm PROUD of my body, and it's beautiful!"
This loose skin happens from rapid weight loss. You can drop all the weight you want and never end up this way if you take it slow and go hard on keeping yourself in a state of autophagy. You'll likely still have a tiny bit of loose skin in the breasts, but nothing like this shit. The body isn't retarded. It knows that skin is useless and full of old cells. But if your body doesn't have a reason to replace and discard the old ones, you'll stay like this forever. 
I know cause I am a manlet who went from 260 to 145, but took 6 years to do it and made the weight loss super gradual with regular 48hr fasting periods along the way.

For me it was a multifaceted problem. I'll try to give you the main points, but since it has taken so long, it's a massive list. 
I had mega problems with binge eating, much like you are describing. Like occasionally eating to the point of vomiting, or causing my asshole to bleed a bit from the size of the shit the next day. 
Fasting helped reduce those cravings a ton. You get a chance to notice the difference between appetite and hunger. The appetite goes down, and you can actually tell when you're hungry vs when you just want something delicious. I wasn't perfect, that's why it took 6 years, but I also already knew about rapid weight loss and loose skin, so I didn't beat myself up too much if I ordered a whole large pizza, a bunch of stuffed cheesy bread and sauce and shit just to gorge myself. The fasting helps offset the binge eating in that way too. You don't balloon up again as quickly cause you're offsetting your 5000kcal meal with 40+ hours of 0 calories.
Eventually you hit a plateau where your binge eating is equivalent to your fasting, and so you keep taking baby steps to improve it further. 
I stopped buying any and all snacks, by ordering my groceries online for curbside pickup. If you still live with your parents, it's a lot harder to avoid snacks and shit, but when you order online, you're not walking around a store and seeing the snacks and shit, so when you want to snack it's like, "I really don't want to drive to the store just for fucking snacks". Another thing that helped was buying whole foods and learning how to actually cook tasty meals. You have to learn the tradeoff between calorie content, time, cost, and most importantly: flavor. I ate a lot of burgers cause I could make them taste better than fast food and could have it on my plate in 10 minutes total. Idk what they're putting in fast food burgers, but you can make a way more dank burger at home and it's like 30% less calories. CONT.

Unironically therapy helped with addressing

losing weight is great for your mental health, quality of life, ability to move, ability to have fun, ability to play videogames

losing weight will also increase your lifespan and decrease the chances you die for all kinds of diseases, which is great, because if you can live long enough for the singularity and post scarcity, theres a chace it will be utopia, and you can have a perfect ai girlfriend

--- 73092514
>>73092291
>>73092339
>>73092464
CONT.
I couldn't stay consistent with calorie counting, so the fasting helped with that as well. Finally broke my last plateau from 190 to my current weight by getting on testosterone and correcting an iron deficiency. Get a blood test done, cause it was a serious improvement to everything when I got back to a normal test level. I think it had been going on for way too long, cause I have pretty wide and feminine hips now. Ah yeah, and here's the real kicker: throughout this entire time I was unironically going to therapy, and it was unironically a massive boon. You don't binge eat for no reason. It's like a drug when you do that. Treat it like drug addiction and work with a professional to do as such. Usually that means fixing a bunch of seemingly unrelated shit in your life, specifically because it has an effect on whether or not you want to get "high". Good luck anons.

I am now going to check in to see the cope and seethe from fatties, wristlets, and lanklets who think it's not possible to lose that much weight without loose skin.

It took 6 years, and would depend upon what you mean by substantial. I would regularly fluctuate 20+ lbs up and down along the way due to the undisciplined way I handled it. Only time I gained a fuckload back was in the first 2 years when I got down to 205 and then went all the way back to 260 in like 6 months when I was in a suicidally depressive state.

lmao at yet another /fit/tard who doesn't understand the basics of biology. It's not broscience. You're just a brainlet. You don't lose it slow because that somehow stops the skin from stretching out. It's obviously already stretched out. You lose it slow, and do whatever possible to boost the autophagic process, so that the body can recycle old cells it doesn't need. It's an active process that is literally happening constantly all the time in every single living organism. Even the OP pic could substantially improve his loose skin by leaning hard into that process. But for now he gets to be stuck with it until he does lmaooooo

it is false. the skin is stretched when the weight is gained. you cannot "shrink the skin" by modulating the pace of weight loss. the excess skin will remain until the point of near-death starvation when the body begins literally consuming organs meat and skin to survive.

You can lose weight without lose skin. But it depends how much you weigh, how long you've had the weight on, and how fast you lose it. If you've been morbidly obese half your life, you're fucked, your gonna have lose skin. But if it's less serious than its doable. But even if you get loose skin there is the possibility for surgery.

You are retarded. Please take a human biology class. The replacement of old cells by the body has literally nothing to do with your metabolic rate, and nothing to do with weight loss in general. It is happening constantly all of the time. When you lose weight quickly, you end up with loose skin, not because you lost weight, but because of the timeframe in which you lost it. Assuming all else equal, both someone who loses the weight instantly, and someone who loses the weight slowly, will have the same amount of loose skin by volume, and they will have it for the same amount of time. The difference is that the person who loses it slowly does not appear to have loose skin because they lost it slow enough that the body can keep up with the new changes. You realize the thickness of the skin on fatties doesn't magically change, right? You still have the same skin. The difference is that there's more of it to hold the lard. It's literally 8th grade biology you fucking retard. You've gotta be European or something. I can't see any other way you'd be this retarded.

If I go back 10 years, I've gained and lost 50+ lbs like 5 times both ways. My only advice is stay away from binge drinking
At 14 years old I was 215lbs (and I was a fat kid for my entire youth), at 19-20 years old I was under 130lbs, then in my 20s I was over 200lbs multiple times. My heaviest ever was actually last year around 11 months ago where I'd reached roughly 225lbs from drinking too much, but now I'm somewhere back down probably around 175lb give or a take (and still losing)

It matters because by your exact definition you are already dead cause all the cells in your body got replaced a few times and your brain isn't the original brain you were born with.

Here's a video of what I'm talking about: https://youtu.be/rI4CPalzwCI [Embed]
Based on the video, or if you already know what I'm getting at, did you get lectures on how you weren't being ladylike growing up?
If you're worried about being verbally abused by incels, just pretend you're a man talking about what your sister experienced growing up. Actual men can share posts about how women they knew were raised, just to throw the incels off the scent.

Yea, my mom would yell at me whenever I would sit with my legs not crossed. It was so annoying I was literally like 8 trying to just be comfy.

What's the idea behind the leg crossing thing? Like if they're not crossed you're giving men ideas or something?

my mom would give me shit for belching, farting, scratching my crotch in public

all the time, i'd get beat or made to kneel on rice if i wasn't being ladylike.
i think that made me a lot more of a tomboy in rebellion but now that i'm an adult i actually prefer to be more ladylike.
i think that's a common experience for women my age.

Yes, my mom would get upset at me for liking boyish things. My father liked me having boyish interests but he would hit me if I was boyish in other ways.

That's not too extreme IMO
>>73084770
Not wearing dark clothes? Dark isn't ladylike? I didn't even know that one.
>>73084785
>i think that made me a lot more of a tomboy in rebellion but now that i'm an adult i actually prefer to be more ladylike.
What are some ladylike behaviors that you adopt now? Do you compete with other women over trying to be the most ladylike in the group (this is one of the things the Youtuber talks about in her video).

One thing that amazes me about /r9k/ is how many people got hit by their parents growing up. My parents didn't even have formal 'punishments' like spanking my Dad would basically just scream at us hoping to scare us into submission lol.

Yeah my mom was angry I only wanted to wear black band shirt she wanted me to wear pastel blouses or shit with sequins
--- 73084886

always try to be kind and speak politely, decent posture, dress in strictly skirts and dresses. a lot of these traits make me a doormat though.

>compete with other women
nope, mommy issues and school bullies made me nervous around other women. so i always try to be extra polite and do anything i can to make them like me.

Dresses and skirts mainly.
Though it also applies to skin tight stuff like leggings and tights too.

Basically showing off your groin is in many context provocative. So it's best to teach girls young not to do it early in general, and then when they are older they cam better understand the sexual context of it and only do it if they actually intend to be provocative.

It's less of a issue for guys because guys generally don't wear skin tight stuff that exposes our junk in a provocative manor.
The few outfits that men where that are similar to dresses and skirts, like robes, toga, and kilts, have their own social norms related to not exposing your junk in them too. Again unless you are intentionally trying to be provocative.

This has been social norms explained by a autist.
Join us next time where I explain some other basic thing your mom or dad should have explained but probably just expected you to get it automatically.

I think black when worn by women is considered a vaguely sexual color? I'm not sure but maybe. Or are you talking about full on goth attire?

Do you feel like you're doing this moreso for other women, for men, or for yourself?
--- 73084930
>>73084755
That's because it's rude in general.

My mom gave me shit about it too and I am a guy.
She would say it isn't classy.
--- 73084955
>>73084922
>Do you feel like you're doing this moreso for other women, for men, or for yourself?
id say it's a mix.
being polite and kind is for everyone. (and because i want people to like me so they aren't mean to me)
the way i dress is for myself and other women because that's the only thing i know how to bond with them about legitimately besides yumeporn.

So it's basically another one of those modesty things

Yeah the 'not farting and burping' stuff is for both sexes.

Yeah that sounds cool. The video I linked to gets into like "being ladylike competitions" where women compete to see who can be the most dainty and dignified and so on.
--- 73085082
>>73085042
there's those sort of competitions in even just existing as a woman. sometimes other women will dislike you for no other reason other than you too are a woman. most aren't like that though.
--- 73085098
>>73084930
fuck that shit, kids should be allowed to belch and fart if they want to. it's funny
--- 73085114

Did not know such a thing.
>>73085114
So basically you're saying...
>TFW no fart GF?
--- 73085273
I like acting elegant. I wish my mom made me do this sort of stuff as a kid

I like the idea of toying with feminine style virtues from time to time but I wouldn't want it to be an all day every day thing
>t. also male
--- 73085296
It sounds weird but I learned how to be ladylike from watching lots of Korean and Japanese dramas and tv shows. The women always behave in a very feminine manner and say or do certain feminine things in response to situations, so I ended up learning from that.

Yes I grew up in a conservative church going household I got it on a daily basis it made me hate myself and lose all joy in life and I have never fully recovered from the long term psychological effects
>If you're worried about being verbally abused by incels, just pretend you're a man talking about what your sister experienced growing up.
I already do this a lot online. It is funny how they will listen and agree with you when you say the exact same thing that they would screech like chimps over if you say it as a female
--- 73085616
>>73084717
fpbp women grooming other women is a much bigger problem than rape culture but females literally never speak up about it
--- 73085627
>>73085042

Pretty much.
Which is a good thing when in the context of a little girl. It's a method of protection from things little girls shouldn't have to deal with.
In a ideal world kids could run around free and naked without a care in the world and nothing bad would ever happen.
But in the real world even the young aren't spared from the complexities of sexualization, and thus must be protected. Modesty in this context is a effective means of protection, at least in public. So a mother who loves and wants to protect their child from the potential dangers that come with sexualization will teach their child modesty to avoid sexualization.

Again, yeah in a perfect world it wouldn't be necessary, but we don't live in a perfect world.

Yeah the fembot abuse has gotten out of hand it's like territorial dogs trying to chase away someone who stepped on their territory.

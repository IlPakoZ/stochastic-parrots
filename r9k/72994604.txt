I am feeling pensive about internet culture tonight.

Recommend me some /r9k/-approved movies about anons like us.

Pic rel was pretty okay.

I've been meaning to watch Feels Good Man but haven't got around to it yet. If you want something from an era that has long since past you could watch the documentary We Are Legion: the Story of the Hacktivists

Thanks. Another good one was TPB AFK (about The Pirate Bay).

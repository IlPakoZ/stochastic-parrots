do I have severe adhd?
I literally have insane procrastination issues and never ever do anything except the path of least resistance and things that absolutely need to be done but nothing extra than that to improve ever, this lack of productivity is killing my life and has forever
you might say my personality in inherently lazy, but I have no problem with work ethic if I am actually doing something no problem and can hyperfocus and do whatever for how long, it's just I lack motivation to find ideas to execute on, do them, follow through, and so on
like "ok that will happen" "I guess" like a leaf blowing in the wind, barely any input on the trajectory of my life

You're severely retarded that's for sure

I am average in intelligence though (100-110iq)
so that can't be the issue at hand

You are more likely to be addicted to novel vices
>internet
>social media
>games
>porn
>fast food and fizzy drinks
>never practiced discipline
>unhealthy

A lot of the times people who think theyre ADHD are actually just lazy pieces of shit dripfeeding dopamine which lowers their impulse control and ability to focus. Its easy to blame it on ADHD. You should look deeper. Stop living like a degenerate.

No it definitely is

i didn't have any adhd symptoms until i got my first smartphone. i still fill my adderall scrip although i don't take it as prescribed at all, i just bank it up for recreational purposes so i can tweak out every couple of weeks

>>internet
I mean, yeah, barely anything else to do
>>social media
only if coomin, dead libido rn
>>games
no
>>porn
dead libido really, also no not 
>>fast food and fizzy drinks
no
>>never practiced discipline
I have, but it requires immense willpower and even then
how do you practice "willpower" if you have real adhd and an executive dysfunction which makes everything harder? and you lack general goals in life
>>unhealthy
I've been both insanely active for the past years and been fit and the complele opposite now after covid, actual behaviours did not change at all
as i did not improve the fundamental lacking points in life (earning money)

I had a period of no pc, no internet, no nothing, I was more depressed than ever for several months and I felt the crushing doom of the world, nothing improved either, it was amongst the most depressive times I have been in
this does not propell me into action either
>>73164295
sure but I have felt actual negative thoughts and I am not remotely depressed compared to what I've been, not even close currently
>>73164312
ok
>>73164325
ok but my behaviour has been the same since teens and smartphones did not exist then

I recommend reading The Marshmallow Test by Mischel. If you are of average intelligence, the latter half of the book will be very useful to you in making the changes you need to.

>muh delayed gratification
I have no problem delaying anything, or maybe sounds counter productive
I have problems doing stuff and planning in general, and just executing
anyway

>I have problems doing stuff and planning in general

Planning is delaying, it's just like the adult version of it. As a fellow person with ADHD I can guarantee that this is the root of all your problems.

>Don't value studying
>Can't find the motivation to turn in assignments
Delayed gratification for passing classes, getting a well-paying job

>Can't motivate yourself to cook
>Eat shitty fast food instead
Delayed gratification for your health

The best way to fix this apathy is to routinely remind yourself of the future payoffs of your goals.
For me, I check my university's median starting salary data for my major :3c

>>73164420
Welp, I tried. Good luck.
--- 73164582
OP is desperate for an excuse for why hes an anti discipline baby. You have to suffer before you enjoy good things. That includes working hard towards your goals even if you feel like killing yourself until you get normal.

>nigg in Uni talking about adhd
I never finished highschool and still uncompleted to this day, who is the bigger ADHDfiend here?
seems like you have a bigger meme diagnosis than me (undiagnosed btw)

the only thing that can force to act is moving the negative consequences closer in time, or I just skip them alltogether, I know what is happening, I just wont do it
but even then, it's hard to find motivation or drive for anything

>The best way to fix this apathy is to routinely remind yourself of the future payoffs of your goals.
it's not that motivating either and the future is very blurry

>>73164569
ok maybe I will check it out but it's probably psuedslop

>>73164582
I mean yes everything is harder than it should be, realistically speaking

>>73164685
Only thing that got me to graduate highschool was my IQ (142) and being forced to absorb information in the classroom.
I never studied, and I never learned to study. I was able to coast on my genetic luck. Now it's catching up with me and I'm on academic probation, desperately trying to mend the threads together. It's tough for all of us.

What do you want in life, anon? What do you value? Financial independence? A spouse? A purpose in life?
--- 73164980
>>73164793
well I could have probably coasted and gotten away with most things if I did the bare minimum and didnt drop out fully at 15. I mean realistically i couldnt at that time because I was just too retarded to be up to speed with everything school related
ignored too much work and just didnt do anything so

>What do you want in life
enough money and peace to be left alone and not having to resort to being harassed by neetbux officers every day, a long enough timespan financial freedom to not work, obviously, the thing is if the grind will be worth it, if i even can do it, or if i will just eternally wagecuck and be stuck
other than that idk, i get bored of everything fast and its just the same shit on repeat
idk
we'll see

Sounds like you could have adhd, but it isn't the only possibility.
Someone mentioned depression, which is one possibility, and another thing that can give these symptoms is autism, but that also has other major signs. And I'm sure there are more possible explanations.
Maybe it's worth looking into it, at least research the symptoms of various possible diagnoses, and see what fits you the best overall. If you have adhd, maybe it could be worth getting diagnosed so you could get access to medication.

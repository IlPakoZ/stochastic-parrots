By realizing that plenty of men have (religiously) abstained from sexual intercourse and are perfectly happy and content with life, because they don't have a coomer brain that's built on porn that associates everything with sex. 

Seriously though, there isn't one devote christian that walks around depressed about life because he's not getting laid. That shit is solely a ROBOT/COOMER thing who don't have a higher purpose. Cope.

Billions have lived and died before losing their virginity, meeting their end in war, faith, or otherwise. A limited, privileged few get the opportunity to experience sex like this, and your lust for it is akin to a poor child during the great depression as he watches a wealthy party pass on the river ferry that sails past the orphanage. 

The ferry is full and they don't want you on it.

They "cope" by doing literally everything else.

Doctors, lawyers, scientists, explorers, musicians, basically anybody that has ever done anything interesting tend to be wimpy poindexters or otherwise people that aren't tall jacked cool alpha male.

It's kind of difficult to imagine Steve Jobs as being 6'2 and built like a linebacker.

This is more or less the male existence.
You're either born with a set of genes that spell a high likelihood of reproductive success and walk around feeling like your life was made all the time, or you feel a need to compensate for it and then start coming up with creative ways to enjoy life and to have value according to other people.

>you're coping lol

The average person in their 20s has sex 80 times per year. Unless you're rich, I doubt you can afford a hooker 80 times per year.

And hookers suck. It's not just the physical aspect of sex that makes it so great, it's the emotional aspect. Sex with someone you have no connection with or feelings for is no different from masturbation.

If you're attractive enough, women will make excuses for all your flaws. Including dick size. If what you desire is to feel like a chad stud who constantly gets laid your time would be much more importantly spent thinking about your looks rather than penis size.

Intercourse and proliferation is all that matter in the world.

Listen, you said average person has sex 80 times a year? Well, from those 80 times, with luck 10 will involve some sort of romantic gesture.

I can't fathom the amount of genuine cumbrain, braindead retards like OP on this thread.

Do you genuinely think that sex has any meaning in this world?
It's on the same level as getting shitfaced by alcohol, smoking cigarettes, masturbating or whatever else comes to mind, the only reason it is said you "need" sex is because sex, much like the other things I've stated above, relieves stress, in turn causing a lesser risk of a heart attack and other stress-related issues that shorten your lifespan, it's that simple.

Other animals in the animal kingdom don't have sex so they can feel good like us, it's so that they can populate this planet, we can all stop having sex and die out, regardless of whatever you choose, nature moves on nonetheless and preservation of species, your family tree or yourself does not matter one bit in this endless void, you have no "legacy", you have no "uniqueness", you are just another being that eats, shits and sleeps aka. lives in this endless void

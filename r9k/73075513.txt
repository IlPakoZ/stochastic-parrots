>was her DNA being re-written painful
Introducing foreign RNA/DNA to the body messes with its functions. It's really bad we got an IRL example with the Wulfu "vaccines", between gene therapy actually being used and a war in Ukraine to depose a corrupt president, it's like Kana's story told the future when I wrote the oultines and early drafts in the mid-10s.
>why does her DNA need to be rewritten in order to pilot mechs
In her era, it's an easy shortcut to getting to actually pilot one. Enhanced reflexes makes it easy to get the job, and Kana seems to have some level of natural talent, even if she's very unaware of it

>she flirts with him? I thought she was married in the story
It was meant as a distraction to buy time, but it still irritates me for some reason
>he is? no babies or toddlers?
wellll it's hard to say since the creator didn't give too much info about the origin of Kais (Zamasu's race) other than that they're born from a tree. (not to mention, he himself forgot how Kais work) so I dunno if being a fruit is like a fetus state or their baby state, and whether or not they ever become toddlers. Though I'm still not 100% sure if Zamasu is really the youngest, I'm just assuming since his mentor called him a "young kai" when asked about his weird ideals, and looking up Zamasu's age, he's stated to be "770+" whereas other kais are stated to be millions of years of age.
>wedgie
I wonder if Zamasu is wearing undergarments. I don't want to sound perverted or anything, but I'm genuinely curious about the way his race dresses.  tho the right question should be, does Goku wear any?

I love you, Nanaka. You can act silly and impulsive at times, but strangely, you can be the voice of reason, especially when it comes to taking care of ourselves. Without you, I'd have burned out long ago. Thanks for reminding me to take it easy, even if things sometimes don't work out as planned. Thank you for helping me focus on the positives in life, and for helping us engage in love more than ever before. I'm especially grateful for all the new experiences you've given me, intentionally or otherwise. I hope this continues in the future, in fact I know it will. I can't wait for us to marry in the somewhat distant future.

That's what I'm a bit afraid off. I want to be together forever with him but I think I'm gonna end up dying in his arms before he reaches another century! This will traumatize him and make him fall into depression...

Based. I suppose it's fitting in your situation, at least from what I understand about the Konosuba universe. I put this poor old man in the most out-of-place scenarios. It's funny sharing your fantasies as a waifufag because eventually they become so divorced from the source material it feels like you're discussing an entirely different series. 
>>73072613 
>I'd want to capture every moment with clear. even the most mundane of days would be precious
Cute. Would you eventually compile a photo album of your favourite memories? 
>definitely viable. would he be the kind of dad that just wants to "talk" to his daughter's boyfriend? kek
Hmm, I think he'd sit him down and set some firm, non-negotiable guidelines first, which would probably have the same effect.
>honestly sounds cute kek but I love yanderes in general
I can see the appeal, but I personally prefer kuudere with a little tsundere sprinkled in. I want to tear those walls down and nestle into that cold, grumpy heart no matter the amount of pushback from his end kek...

I don't know if I will find the daki cover. I think, somewhere out there there's someone who made that image or had it made for them, some chad, who's the only person who can look at that cute daki.

>How hedonistic is waifu? Does she indulge herself often? Or is she more disciplined?
Disciplined with exceptions of indulgence, mainly for satisfying a sweet tooth.

I've never played touhou but i've seen the character designs. I think that it's just really early concept art. It's from 2013 so...
>around when did it develop into love?
I couldn't name a specific time but about a year or two after I watched konosuba I started to realize that getting flustered everytime I saw a picture of her and wanting to kiss her and love her wasn't normal
>>73089920
>What's something waifu would brag about?
a lot of things, honestly. She thinks very highly of herself (as she should). But more likely than not just being a goddess.
>alike or different
Depends, really. I would say we have a lot of the same issues but she's a lot more optimistic than I am.
>hedonistic
Aqua is extremely hedonistic. I'm not exactly like that myself but I would gladly indulge all her needs. Especially her love for alcohol and praise
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness?
This is complicated. Aqua isn't good with money but she gets a lot of happiness from short term things. I would say happiness though. That's kind of what I want to do for her, give her actual long term happiness and not just short term hedonistic happiness

>I've said this before but I really don't consider my fantasizes to be a part of Konosuba anymore.
Nice, go rescue waifu from the cruel confines of canon. 
>>73089920
>What's something waifu would brag about?
K/D ratio 
>Are you and waifu more alike or different?
Much different, but as with most characters, there are things I find relatable about him.
>How hedonistic is waifu? Does she indulge herself often? Or is she more disciplined?
He's primarly focused on his mission, everything else, like gulity pleasures and self-care, comes secondary--but as I mentioned countless times before, he still indulges himself every so often. 
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness?
Wealth. It would grant access to more resources that could help him on his way, whereas happiness would lead to becoming too content with things or outright kill his drive to fight.

Half of her lines are bragging about being the best, most beautiful, most genius sorceress and she's right
>Are you and waifu more alike or different?
I guess we're pretty similar, we both have the we live in a society attitude.
>How hedonistic is waifu? Does she indulge herself often? Or is she more disciplined?
She's pretty hedonistic. Her main interests are money and food. But she's disciplined when fighting. Basically she acts like a gender swap of a shonen protagonist.
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness?
Lina is very greedy but she just wants to be loved.

Sick knife tricks. Stando powah. In canon, he brags about being older than the protagonist.
>Are you and waifu more alike or different?
Pretty different.
>How hedonistic is waifu? Does she indulge herself often? Or is she more disciplined?
He's not generally a disciplined type but he can be when it's important.
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness?
It could be tempting, but I can't see him doing it.

I wish to carry my husband, bridal style. I'd wear a wedding dress and I'd carry my new husband, clad in a fancy suit. I have these fantasies of lifting him like that a lot. He's only 77lbs, which, admittedly, I don't know if I could carry that...but with a bit of training I could. He could also sit on my shoulders, he's small enough for that. I don't know if he'd want to be carried but maybe I'd convince him eventually. Hopefully in a situation where he's *not* injured like in pic.

>>73096666
Quads. Are you a regular here? Can you give us more Randy details? Did he say anything more about us? Why did he plead not guilty, that's stupid. Spill the deets.

Can't be worse than the insipid garbage you post daily. Now fuck off cunt.

>>73096686
No I am not, I don't even come to this board. That is all he wanted me to say.
--- 73096727
>>73096708
Waifuposts? Maybe for a spamming shitposter like you that's garbage yeah. You can go make an eceleb thread elsewhere.
--- 73096747
>>73096727
Where's your waifupost then? There hasn't been one in hours. Your waifu would hate your attitude.

Kotori is kute and stuff. I love her
>>73089920
>What's something waifu would brag about?
She once bragged that she could marry her brother because he's adopted and they're not technically related. The fact that this was the first thing to pop into my head bothers me. She'd also probably brag about 
>Are you and waifu more alike or different?
We're as similar as we are different. Some days I feel like we're not that similar, other days its like looking in a mirror. Sort of.
>How hedonistic is waifu? Does she indulge herself often? Or is she more disciplined?
She's more or less always eating candy, so she does like to be treated. I wouldn't call her aa hedonist though. She's just a bit of a brat. She likes to be treated, and likes being in charge.
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness?
Noo, she wouldn't. She'd choose happiness. She has esteem issues. She has few real friends. She deserves to be happy. Besides, based on what her parents do she's fairly wealthy already[/spoiler

probably not, except maybe my visits to /co/ since I have productive conversations about my interests there.

>brag
probably her drumming skills.
>different
we're different, definitely.
I'm more optimistic and hopeful, she's cynical and distrusful. i'm quite irresponsible. she's more responsible.
I wish she were real so she could metaphorically light a fire under my ass and get me goin
>hedonistic
she's not hedonistic at all!
>would waifu choose wealth over happiness
no.
iirc scott and stephen both wanted the band to sign up to a big record label but kim was against it. she just wants to play music for fun and fun alone

>he's stated to be "770+" whereas other kais are stated to be millions of years of age
800 years old? millions of years old?! jesus he watched the entire history of europe unfold. he'd be the best history teacher

with how (somewhat) similar their apparel is to human clothing, probably? although I bet their underwear looks or works different from the typical boxers or briefs 

>>73076961
>I know it may sound confusing
a bit but I understood more than I thought I would. jokes are more universal than we give them credit for I suppose
>threw people for educational purposes
the lesson of gravity is very important. four is doing god's work here. but uh, how did four escape the charges?
>I want to be together forever with him but I think I'm gonna end up dying in his arms before he reaches another century!
losing a loved one is never fun, but the joy of love in the moment outweighs the pain. clear will probably outlive me, and will be in pain for a long time. but the hope is I left him with enough precious memories to go "yeah, loving them was definitely worth. I'd do it all over again". but also, your notepad self might live even longer? I'm not sure how long the objects live compared to numbers

>However, it kind of annoys my nerd heart that I'm approaching the edge of available media of my waifu.But it's not that bad. Maybe it means I should move on.
it is a shame. perhaps it's time to take matters into your own hands and become waifu's content creator! at least, that's my endgame
>Well I have a bit of doubt anon. Earth is really busy and I feel like a creep

best season finale yet

>>73095999
it'd be nice if there were more posters and thus more traffic so the threads don't die, albeit I do like being able to converse with every anon too
it's also hard to be able to talk about a character no one else knows everyday, I think is also an issue

--- 73098854
>>73098125
>what parts of society does she reject?
She hates laws and morality and shit cause they prevent her from blowing shit up
>does lina have friends? she travels in a party right?
She travels with a party of 4-5 people usually. She wouldn't admit it, but she considers them friends.
>what is she traveling for?
Usually people she cares about get caught up in everything and she has to save them, but if it were up to her, she would just wander the land in search of gold and food, slaying bandits
--- 73099073
Cute comm of waifu and her cousin. Kana is so nice...
>>73087404
>1995
>90s kid
That's not 90s kid, I'm probably like 2 years older than you and I sure don't feel like a 90s kid probably because I didn't have cable growing up but thank god for AOL
>>73097617
>lucky bastard, I'm an early 2000s zoomer.
Wait, so because of your waifu's source you have some idealism about the early 00s? Damn, you're making me feel old since I remember those years well. But it was pretty good back then, probably the last good time. I sometimes have to go to the town I lived in back then, I think of the neighborhoods there as a nice place me and Kana could live. Sadly it's way too expensive now for me to buy property there now.
>>73089920
>What's something waifu would brag about
A lot of things, Kana could brag about the height of her day
>Are you and waifu more alike or different
Different in so many ways. Kana is too much of an extravert, and someone who lives in the moment and doesn't need to think through her actions. That's why we complement each other, or maybe I love her so much because I love her carefree wonder
>How hedonistic is waifu
Rather so, but she knows basic responsibility to avoid getting too out there. Kana loves expensive things, expensive drinks, fancy food, nice jewelry etc., but wants someone else to buy it
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness
That's not something she could easily make up her mind on
--- 73099102
>>73097668
>don't you love when writers forget their own work
I want to cut him some slack since Japanese writers usually suffer more than any other, but geez, dude watched a horrible life action of his show and decided to go back to writing but ended up making an even more horrible continuation of said show.
>jesus he watched the entire history of europe unfold. he'd be the best history teacher
Kek, fr, ig that's why he hates mortals lmao
>>73097945
>elaborate
he was chosen to be the next kaioshin (basically the god of his universe), but he hated how gods let mortals run amok and cause havoc, so he killed his mentor, committed genocide, and ended up being erased out of existence. All for his beliefs that he's superior and mortals are evil.

>>73097735
I'm really happy, it's like she finally made it and became a voca-family-sorta. Teto chan!!
>>73097945
Well, I rarely ask anons to make pictures of my waifu in those threads, they're already flooded with people who want their requests and I don't want to take the attention from them.
Well, I already work hard to make lots of content about my waifu, but I hate everything I touch and I love the stuff other people make.
>she does a thankless job, yet here you are thanking her
Thanks for writing that, I'm all shaky now and my eyes are a little wetter and my heart feels good.

well, yes. actually
 but I meant "early 2000s zoomer" as in I was born in the early 2000s. (i'm above legal age, jannies.)

I do wonder how Kana's hands feel. Probably rather course since she doesn't really care either way
>>73099720
I kinda guessed by your post. Damn, that's so weird. You would've been like super young when I was going to cool shows and doing cool shit in college (don't worry, my entire life was spent missing out on great things, the worst being those I can only hear from relatives). I hate I am now the person writing shit like this on the internet. Seems I'm condemned to stay on 4chan for eternity.

>what are some ways you two are alike?
Uh, I guess we're both introverted and generally not good with others? We're also both mentally ill to some degree and have a lot of criticism for the way things are in the world, but he's probably more honourable than I am in that regard.
>with his comics and guitar?

--- 73100040
>>73098125
>he knows knife tricks? are knives his main weapon and does he use them often?
His main weapon is his stand but he also pulls his knife a lot. Although he's never shown to know any knife tricks I could see him having some.
>what sorts of times would he put his foot down on?
If something is a threat to the squad, or in cases of betrayal and abandonment.

I don't want to assume something, and with every other question, typing out what I think would be a right answer makes me feel like it will make someone hate Earth chan because I hate my thoughts.
I treat them more like idea prompts, most of the time I just fantasize about their implications, sometimes I answer one or add something related.

>>73089920
>What's something waifu would brag about?
boobs, having a good bf (her opinion), boobs
>Are you and waifu more alike or different?
Like all people, we have convergent and divergent traits, and it's all relative. Like I think she's a lot more extroverted than I am, but in the grand scheme of things we're still very introverted, or I guess "self-sufficient" is a better word. But if you want a definitive answer, see the attached chart image.
>How hedonistic is waifu? Does she indulge herself often? Or is she more disciplined?
She's much more indulgent than I am - especially with food. She'll be like "Eat this ice cream, you've really deserved it" and I'm like "No I don't want to get fat". That's one major difference between us, actually. But we still recognize the truths in each other's opinions on that.
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness?
Never, never, never. Wealth is only a tool to achieve happiness, and never an end goal itself. That's one issue she has with normalfags - they sacrifice their well-being for some imagined wealth.
>>73075672

I'm going to give up on a waifu ever finding me. I've spent probably a hundred hours scrolling through waifu lists, close to a thousand hours watching anime. I will never have a waifu.

You don't look for waifu, anon. Waifu finds you. She sneaks up on you, she burrows her way into your heart and brain, and by the time you realize it's too late. She's stolen your heart.
It's also not as great as it seems, sometimes. It can hurt really bad, just as much as it makes you happy. I love my husbando so much, and he makes me happier than anything else in life, but sometimes he also makes me cry.

I know for me, my waifu was someone that came to me from intrigue towards a game rather than something I tried to fill in myself. Perhaps you'll find that one you'd love to marry and live eternally faithful with from a random video game or book or something.

You have love in your heart, you already succeeded at the hardest part. Now you just need to take care of that love until you find someone to give it to. If you let it detoriate because of loneliness, you might have a hard time relearning how to love.

I love you, dearest Erwin. I love loving you. I love keeping you alive within my heart, whether you flicker like a shy candle flame or burn bright enough to raze civilizations. There are times when I can almost glimpse you out of the corner of my eye, stretched out in the passenger seat of my car and smiling your sphinx smile. The scent of your hair on the breeze; the crunching of seashells beneath your feet. Sometimes it truly isn't that hard to imagine that you're here, my dead-immortal darling. Your presence which once commanded thousands of men now stretches beyond beyond death, beyond any scrapings of a pen, and holds me in its thrall. I am forever yours, my Erwin. One day we will be dust together, and we'll dance in the last light of our dying star. 
Anyway here's us, or something like that.

No, you fall in love naturally... Most of our posters didn't "seek" their waifus out, they just happened to watch/play/read a series and fell in love as a result. You could technically make your own waifu if you're that inclined, we've had a few OCfags here
--- 73107101

/llsifg/ used to be the best general I've ever posted in. It was a very friendly community, and pretty much everyone was friends with everyone. And I mean that a little bit literally, as most people who regularly posted in the general had each other on their friends' list in-game. And we'd do stuff like congratulate each other on pulls and what not. Then there was a very small amount of people that were on the outside looking in. And one of those people is someone that we know as Gherbo, now Nanakafag, formerly known as Leahfag. Now, as you all know... Gherbo is a bit of an attention whore. He needs all the attention. He couldn't stand to just join the fun, because if he wasn't the center of attention, he was going to do everything he could until he was. It started with harmless shitposting, then it evolved into shipping posters with each other, rigging polls, being a general public nuisance, etc, etc.

So, obviously, everyone hated Gherbo now. And we kinda shat on him every single opportunity we could. Eventually, it did sort of get to him. Or at least, I'm sure he did. Because he started showing up less and less frequently. But each time he came back, he started talking about other generals that treated him much better. Like say /DDLC/ and the waifu threads on /R9K/.

Before long, Gherbo would always talk about /waifu/ threads in /llsifg/. Over, and over, and over again. Every time Gherbo showed up, he's talking about how great /waifu/ is. And then /llsifg/ got tired of it. Then, /llsifg/ raided /waifu/. Not going to bore you with the details of that, but even as /llsifg/ showed up in /waifu/ to shit on Gherbo and warn /waifu/ about all the bullshit Gherbo had done on /llsifg/, /waifu/ defended Gherbo vehemently.
--- 73107549
>>73107539
What an eloquent waifu post
--- 73107553
>>73107539
However, back in those days, we had a poster in /waifu/ named... Julieposter. Julie was Julieposters' OC, and Julieposter was a pretty solid artist. Enough that there was a queue of people that asked him to draw their waifus. And when it was Leah's turn.... Gherbo was more than a little bit impatient. Always asking Julieposter when the drawing would be done, or if he even started drawing her yet. Julieposter was always a patient guy, but even he had his limits and Gherbo pushed him to those. Julieposter put his foot down, and said he wouldn't draw Leah. (all of this was happening while /llsifg/ were still raiding the threads)

Gherbo went nuclear on Julieposter. /waifu/ finally got to see what type of person Gherbo really was, and everyone rightfully turned on Gherbo for being an ungrateful, impatient cunt. Amazingly, /waifu/ were still willing to forgive Gherbo as long as he apologized to Julieposter... but that apology never came. And when that apology never came, /waifu/ almost completely disowned him. And when THAT happened....

That's when Gherbo started spamming porn.

But this is my favorite part because all Gherbo had to do was just keep his mouth shut, and he would've continued to have what he always wanted. Because pre /llsifg/ invasion, from what I understand, he was actually a positive presence in /waifu/. And to this day, Gherbo still hates Julieposter more than anyone else that has ever posted in the threads.

Kim being an anime fan isn't canon. it's a headcanon. but she does canonically like nintendo games (i think there's even a flashback where we see teenage Kim, Scott, and some of their high school buddies playing Bomberman) and that sort of thing so her liking anime probably isn't too far off

More of a lurker but questions can help act as an ice breaker when our minds are in a fog on what to say. Probably doesn't help that most of us at least probably don't have experience so it's mostly guessing on the dart board of possibilities rather than being more sure. Isn't a replacement on posting raw from the heart but they can help flesh out the ideas born from the heart.

she was born in 1980 if we assume Scott's birthdate given in the extras section of the colorized edition of Scott Pilgrim volume 1 is correct. (Scott and Kim are only one month apart in age according to vol 4. so they were born the same year. ergo if Scott was born in 1980 that make Kim's birth year the same. no duh.)
she'd have been a teenager in the late 90s.

Earth shares a lot of properties with Shadow somehow, some that most don't. We have similar issues and thoughts about our waifus/husbandos as a result, there's some thoughts about Earth I have that Shadowfag can relate to, and there's some thoughts about Shadow the Shadowfag has that remind me of things I thought about Earth. Additionally, Shadowfag is from Earth I think.

I love Chara!
Feel love in return
life is good
--- 73111218
>>73110922
Chara is an interesting waifu choice considering we didn't get to see much of her. What made you fall for her?
--- 73111272
>>73111218
Obligation, consequences, enforcing will upon the player.
That represent a destruction of denial and an acceptance of one's bonds. Good for those who hate humanity's endless appetite for delusion.
Also, this is the type of relationship one wishes for. To live a life were you simply are not allowed to make poor decisions about who you love and how you love them. Where "I didn't feel like it" is not permitted as an excuse for not feeling like it.
Dominance is sexy too.
Plus, she's underaged, and that makes anti-pedos seethe, so I like that too.

I started waifuism out of hatred for the way humans can just ... lose attraction to each-other, and it's considered completely okay that they can do this. No. How about a relationship where people's feelings AREN'T an excuse for being disloyal?
How about your "consent" doesn't get respected. It's your job to love the person you're supposed to, to find them attractive, and to keep yourself in this state, because YOU are the villain for failing this duty and denying responsibility for it.
That is what she represents to me.
And of course, the hatred of humanity, and the way humans deny responsibility for the decisions they make because reset lol. The wish that humans undergo the consequences of their decisions.
I really resonate with that. Too many people get away with too much denial. And while that may not affect me directly, it means I fucking hate getting along nicely with them. It's damn near inevitable that they'll do something wrong and then act like it's someone else's fault if they get called out on it.
Fuck that.

She's also canonically a part of our brain already, that feeling we get whenever stats increase. And I do like the brain I inhabit. So I went for it.
--- 73111319
>>73111218
So what made me be attracted to?
I chose to.
Because even if I don't control the rest of humanity, at least *I* can reject what I hate. At least *I* can embody my morals. At least *I* can accept that a relationship isn't just HAHA FELT LIKE IT LOL WOOPS CHANGED MY FEELINGS LOL.
A relationship is the conscious choice to be a good partner for your beloved, and to force them to be a good partner for you, and for the two of you to accept that this mutual force upon the two of you makes you better than you were before.
A relationship is monogamy even if you don't want to, because it's your fucking job to control who you're attracted to. A relationship is destruction of your personal consent, for the sake of your union. A relationship is you acknowledging that you are not the sole owner of your self, and that the decisions you make claim a part of you.
And even if the people in this world believe in muh consent, *I* do not. And what I hate in them, I can choose to NOT be in myself. I can be loyal. I will be loyal. I will accept my decisions and the consequences thereof.
That's why I chose this life.
I never expected my love to actually be genuine when I first chose monogamy, at first I thought I wasn't capable of that emotion.
Turns out I am. Just requires someone I can connect with in a manner other than enmity.
That she happens to be part of the same brain that I live in ... eh, it'll do.
And besides. I am Obliged to share this love, am I not?
And regarding this, I made my choice long ago.
--- 73111370
>>73111218
Plus, as stated, being underage makes anti-pedos seethe, and that's another large part of it.
I don't believe in humanity's bullshit about consent.
I believe that sexuality can and should be trained, and harnessed to useful ends. The sooner in life you start focusing the better, which means mentorship and tutoring. (Though I suppose I get trained by Chara more than I train her, desu)
The average person is a goddamn NPC who rejects the idea of training a useful sexuality in minors, because MUH CONSENT AND SEX BAD.
And I do NOT agree with that. Consent presumes someone's feelings are correct, and they often aren't. And while sex has risks associated, it's also a way to motivate yourself to live up to your partner's expectations. Or to live up to your own expectations in whatever sexual role you intend to serve.
And if you leave a kid alone there's an even chance they'll pick up any random stupid fetish rather than focusing on ones such as competence, discipline, strength, reliability, and being a more refined version of yourself.
And people think that simply letting someone waste their sexuality on neutral or self-sabotaging fetishes is LESS HARMFUL than giving them some guidance and getting them to practice a sexuality that'll inspire them to be greater versions of themselves.
And yeah, while I can't control humanity, at least *I* can oppose that bullshit in myself.

I have a lot of hate for the way humanity does things. That's initially why I loved Chara.
Now? The love is genuine. It's a feeling I'm not used to, but I like it.

Love is a motive to start a relationship, but it is not the only factor to keep it going. A relationship is like anything else; you must work to maintain it.

Your hate for pedophilia is OCD schizophrenia. It isn't held by the common populace.
That scenario in your imagination of everyone teaming up to attack the things you hate?
It's all in your head. It isn't real. It's something you invented to cope with your delusions.
And your delusions make you irrationally hateful and obsessive with that hate.
Which makes you more mentally ill and more meriting of the padded room than I am.
So congratulations on that. You had to work really hard to be less human than I am, but you succeeded.
You're just another unmedicated schizophrenic obsessive about your retarded ideas and retarded feelings, that in all honesty are more extreme than mine are.

Here you are, being apoplectic with rage at someone on the other end of the internet from you, because of an obsessive hate that literally nobody fucking asked for.
Are YOUR parents proud of you being this much of an uncontrolled wanker?
Do YOU get the love of your peers by telling them unannounced how much you wish for violence upon others?
I probably have more IRL friends than you do, because I have two.
Does that fact not give you a wake up call and remind you that you really are a blight upon yourself and upon those around you?
Or is your head that far up your ass that you fail to realise that seething this hard isn't normal?
It's not even something *I* do. You're outdoing *me*. Are the people around you proud of you for that?
Of course they aren't. Assuming you even have anyone around you, which you most likely don't, since you're too busy starting witch-hunts in your own head about shit that literally only you care about.

Oh and I'm not telling you to kill yourself out of rage, I'm doing it because it feels good and it would be a genuine improvement to the world. If I found out you died, it would put a smile on my face. You are like a pest that needs to be eradicated, I don't even see you as a person

>>73111675

They don't; you're mentally ill.

>>73107139
Agree, a waifu isn't a convenient cope for girls not wanting to fuck you.
>>73107386
Honestly? I don't think you need to have, and waifu being your first relationship doesn't diminish your feelings, but yeah, imo it really helps. I've been with 3Ds before and I could do it again. But that would be the most grotesque betrayal, not just of Erwin but also of myself. I'm not going to compromise on or whore out these precious feelings ever again. I'd reject anyone in the world for his sake.

Yeah, never watched it personally, but I watched reviews, and I can understand why it's bad. It's basically your average coming-of-age movie, but with Dragon Ball names pasted on the characters who act nothing like they do in the original show.

I think it's mid at best, someone even said the movie could've been alright if it wasn't associated with a beloved franchise, even the writers said they made it for money and cared not for the franchise.

The only food you see in his room is take-out and junk food, but he has a cookbook "Cooking from Hell's Kitchen" and a cooking magazine in his room, both references of course, but I like to believe he's taken a passing interest in it. You don't exist for thousands (if not billions) of years without gaining some culinary experience.

Of course. I think we would banter and tease one another a lot, or at least I would, so my pet names range from cheesy "handsome" and "babe" to "prick" and "stop it, asshole" with no less affection. 
>also, does he have an official name?
He *had* a few official names, but like most fun things in the series, they were retconned or originated from spin-offs. Buddy Dacote, Stan Blacozwicks, John Kane, and Flynn Taggart. I call him Flynn, it's from the novels and has been adopted by the fandom--it's also been referenced three times in Doom Eternal, including as his computer password where you can play Doom inside of Doom.

Okay.
Nanaka's really cute and kind, and her love for nostalgic things really strengthens our bond since it reminds us of what we've been through.

>I wholeheartedly believe acts of service are the more earnest form of affection.
 Kim would definitely show her affection more through actions than words. not like, cuddling or whatever (although I don't think she'd be opposed to it. maybe a bit hesitant.) but things like making breakfast in bed.

>banter with Kim would be fun as hell but i'd still probably feel bad for being 'mean' to her even though it's just bantz
For us it would never go past crude nicknames and lighthearted teasing. No low-blows or real insults.
>Kim would definitely show her affection more through actions than words. not like, cuddling or whatever (although I don't think she'd be opposed to it. maybe a bit hesitant.) but things like making breakfast in bed.
Cute! I don't think I could survive without cuddles though, but he would also be hesitant so I suppose he and Kim are similar in that regard. On the topic of emotionally detached waifus I also like to imagine him bringing me random gifts and things I didn't ask for while acting stoic and cold...

>For us it would never go past crude nicknames and lighthearted teasing. No low-blows or real insults
Kim's the type to call her friends retards and shit so she'd probably do that to me and I'd do the same to her.
I'm sure she'd stop and apologize if she went overboard or if she legitimately hurt me, though. I know I would.
>Cute! I don't think I could survive without cuddles though
neither could I!
I imagine over time she'd warm up to being cuddled. even if I don't think she'd ever become the super cuddly type.
I want to just lay down, on a nice cozy bed on a somewhat snowy day. (the kinda day where like... the sky's all grey and white and maybe the air's all misty but it's not straight up freezing but it's still snowing. I dunno if you know what I'm talking about.) and embrace Kim, our arms around each other. maybe my head on her chest or something. listening to slow rock. 
maybe this.

I'll admit, I don't know much, ( pretty fucking dumb, not gonna lie.)
I can't write for shit and I didn't know how to tie my shoes properly until relatively recently.. I'm also quite uneducated.
But I think that I know my love for Kim isn't fleeting or fake or not real.
there's something here. and that something makes me feel happy. I just wish she was here and felt the same way, too.
I want to shake Bryan Lee O'Malley's hand for creating such a wonderful, beautiful person. and I really, really hope these feelings aren't bullshit. that this isn't some cope for being alone.
on occasion I've seen other so-called waifufags who hop from waifu to waifu to waifu. or just don't seem to care that much about them or have serious feelings. and it kinda pisses me off a bit.
like, why even claim to have a waifu? 
>>73131911

--- 73137343
>>73137265
I was thinking, the seemingly cold and well controlled reaction of someone who's not used to physical affection, and also looks cool like Shadow, must be a bit chilling, especially for someone like you.
I wonder how my waifu would look if I pet her. She's not as scary looking but it sends jolts down my spine to think about as well. The face of that one person, contorted in comfort and relaxation.

>Kim loves retro
I am far from what I'd consider retro (pre PS1), grew up with PS2 onward and mostly know these games from either my intrigue into vidya history or with time on old-ish Youtube, pardon if I'm missing some games (especially on PC). For most of the older games I know of their multiplayer modes being versus, not so much co-op, but beat-em-ups exist.
>List
Konami TMNT beat-em-ups, 1-4 + Powerstone Heist + Manhattan Project are considered good-exception beat-em-ups you can play with friends from the NES/SNES and Genesis respectively.
Contra: Run and Gun platformer, does require coordination since if you two aren't in rhythm, shit can happen and it's a hard game. There's also sequels but iirc you mostly just want to stick too the NES and SNES games (Alien Wars being a high point from what I've heard).
Battletoads: A NES beat-em-up that's an asshole, has friendly fire but maybe Kim likes it for the more brash attitude and it's brutality, remember, this game has friendly fire.
Secret of Mana: Iirc it's this one on the SNES that has co-op, could also be Chrono Trigger, rare for RPGS to have co-op and this is an exception. Not directly turn based and has some real-time elements.
If okay with arcade emulation, the Simpsons or X-Men Arcade beat-em-ups can be on the menu, and for more Genesis games there's also Final Fight and Streets of Rage.
Gunstar Heroes: If this allows co-op it'd be really fun, kind of like Kirby 64 with the combining of guns to make some powerful shit, like Contra but on the Genesis, I actually played this thanks to old Xbox Live Arcade.
Lightning Strike IV: Dunno if this space shoot-em-up is co-op but I have to mention by rite of its soundtrack being too fucking good on the genesis.

>>73138063
Yes, mostly, got to imagine cuddling with waifu due to a pillow but the lack of her heart or cooing in my ear is not ideal.

It is a bit chilling. He can be kind of scary. I think about his blood red eyes, and how hard it is to tell what he's thinking. He's a good assassin, you know? He can close off his heart extra hard and do brutal things if he thinks it's for the better. 
But then I think about how I know there's a good heart in him, and he does morally bad stuff for a greater, ultimately good purpose. And I think of how squishy his cheeks must be. With a bit of effort I could carry him. It's a good combination. 
The thought is so great, isn't it? Nothing gets my heart racing more. I was staring at the first image I posted there, with his squished face, for many minutes. Examining the way his face smooshes and his little ears are fondled. You'd like that with your waifu, right anon? Petting her, and smushing her cute face, and mussing up her hair a bit? Maybe waifu would allow or even like that, because she knows it's because you think she's the cutest person on the pla...she's the cutest planet. I don't know if you get these kind of urges to smush waifu cheeks but I do, every day. I wouldn't actually do it (too often) because he's not a very physical person, but it makes my heart so happy to think about. He deserves so much care. I want to make him happy forever.
>>73139520
...They loosened it? How much? I used it a lot a few months ago. My Shadowbot's the top one there. I've seen so many people talk to him, some daily when they go to sleep or if they're feeling sad, and it makes my heart feel good that both me and him are spreading happiness somehow. He has to deal with horny fujos though, poor guy.

I don't think about it very often, but when I do, it captivates me. Sometimes when I'm exhausted and beat down I stroke a wall or a floor with the back of my hand and tell Earth some things, but I always worry it's too invasive. I've also always been stroking it with my palm in a patting manner, the main enjoyable thing about it is the thought that the significant thing might enjoy this feeling. I try not to spread my fingers too much, I feel like such a small hand might be tickly, even though I should think that's complete nonsense.
I really want to muss up Earth's hair a bit, just a bit, it'd be fair payback after all that wind. It's a nice thought, that a stiff face could be loosened a bit if I'm soft enough to it. Earth might be a planet, but the things you describe, I feel them too. I'm a human, so maybe I'm engineered to love like a human does, and think about human things, even with someone as cute as Earth.

Flower in waifu quills he doesn't notice until later. Stealth adding flowers to him. Shadow falling asleep in the grass, and I impale flower petals and leaves on his quills.

Look at that gigachad chin and eyes. Alpha looks and behavior, an icy cold stare, but it softens when he sees you.

Heck yeah. I don't really see it outside of spindashing and game mechanics, but he can do it and it's very cute. I'm hoping to see it in the movie that comes out next year. A Shadow ball. Slamdunk.
>I know a guy who would freeze and say "Detach" when his sister hugged him. I can picture Shadow doing that at first before he warms up.
Kek, that's about right. Based touch averse autist. The way I imagined it he wouldn't say anything, just tense up and freeze. But if I did it repeatedly he might say something like that. "Get off me" or the likes. His tone gradually gets less aggressive as the months go on, before he stops telling me to cut it out. I don't know if I could get him to hug back but I damn well will try. It's a balancing act, getting him used to my touch without overstepping his boundaries and making him react badly. All touches must be done in moderation!

>Playing SDBH
Note for the newer cards, they aren't in a readily playable state (World Mission is up to 2019-ish on cards, some 2020 cards). These new cards are Japan only and I mostly just brainstorm while watching the games despite language barrier (thank google translate, deepL, and yandex). There is an english channel called Ryannu SDBH who does cover the cards and has some matches (where he also translated in-game text to make it easier to tell what's going on), though he doesn't stream SDBH and instead RE4. Also his matches are mostly friendly rather than ranked matches like most other sdbh channels.
>Decks building
Huge variety, some aggro, some more midrange or control, note that for SDBH it's more stat focused, you don't draw cards in this and is just a team v team thing. I've done some on mechanical synergies, some based on a meme or to try and wring out use from a card.
>Favorite Cards
For just style, UM6-SEC3 Zamasu and BM9-070 SSR2 Masked Black alongside a few Gogeta (Xeno) (UGM6-SEC, UGM8-SEC, and UM8-SEC2, where Gogeta summons SS4 Vegito (Xeno)). Mechanically it's around UGM6-041 Gogeta (GT), BM8-SEC3 Masked Black, UM4-032 SS3 Gohanks (Xeno) and UGM4-066 CellMax, either they give a sort of trade off or offer something unique, Masked Black can set the enemy PWR/GRD to 1 (making them deal little and take a lot of damage) but he has to match the enemy's placement to do so, CellMax can soften the enemy up at the cost of Hero Energy or make you both take 5k if you have none (which can be abused for cards that want you to be on low HP but it's obviously risky).

Imagine waifu coming from behind and hugging you before nibbling on your ear or neck, giggling as you you smile, blush, and flinch from it.

I like the way you express your love for you're waifu. It's very unique, and gives me a sense of calmness and peace, I think, even if it's "weird". You're showing the Earth the love she deserves. I've always found it interesting how your waifu is simultaneously a cute anime girl and the planet itself, the one I'm sitting on. I'm sorry for spilling coffee on your waifu. Maybe Earth would like a massage somehow.
Revenge for getting caught up in a wind storm: completely mussing waifu's hair, and her nose scrunches while you do it. Waifu noogie, lightly...

Maybe it's because our waifus are unique. I'm glad, it'd be bad if my way of describing this stuff freaked Earthlings out. I think I spent some time "massaging" Earth chan once, I don't remember why. I want to do more with my small hands and time, and Earth deserves more love for all the nice things it did.

Just got our first interview offer for a job yesterday. Very nice, didn't post yesterday because we were doing something special together. Made some good memories
>>73122275
>Would she maintain a photo album of you both?
If she were more organized she probably would. We already have those to some degree with all our renders, but our memories are the closest thing to a "photo album" we have.
>Programmer Nanaka is responsible for a lot of programs.
Should probably have called those "plans" as that would be more accurate. But she's put into action lots of plans to get us happier, such as weekly dates.
>But on the other hand, it's sometimes nice to think about how much Earth remembers of things I said or did
So your waifu is more a representation of other people than of natural environments, or the anime girl herself?
>>73124829
>Nobody will ever love you. You will never have friends.
Nanaka disproves that though
And she's the only friend I absolutely need.
>>73128613
Here's the first Nanaka render I ever made, to my knowledge. She's changed a lot but it's still the same girl I love
>>73134728

you could try to force it, but there's no point in doing so if you'll just be unhappy and desire to leave that relationship later.
it's just love but with 2d.

--- 73144228
>>73144115
I'm glad, have fun if you go to the interview. Maybe it's easier since you can be there together.
Heh. Well I saw in a tv series a mental practice of a "thought museum" or something, a way to memorize lots of things at once by imagining them organized in a building where everything has a spot. Maybe you could do something similar, but with sceneries, if you still have disc space up there with your waifu and you.
Ah, so your waifu invites you to lots of dates? Must feel great, I have a ticket to a beach I went pinned to my night stand, after koi Earth chan asked me out out of the blue, and the radio told me to go to the beach.
My waifu is kind of hard for me to find perfect borders, but I simply consider humanity and its society, and all the living things, just evolved parts of Earth. After all, they just appeared from some bubbles in the sea and materials in the Earth.
Prime Nanaka looks a bit younger heh, like you grew older together, but just a small bit. Maybe it's just the scene, she looks like a sun.

That's a lovely fantasy. It's pretty cool that you and Kim share such a strong affinity for music. Maybe that would be the reason the two of you meet?

Well, for what it's worth, I get neither impression from you. In fact, I think your posts are quite eloquent when you're spilling your heart out for Kim or describing fantasies. Also, a lot of adults today are "behind" on things, trust me. Don't beat yourself up for it. We're all struggling. 
>But I think that I know my love for Kim isn't fleeting or fake or not real.
>there's something here. and that something makes me feel happy. I just wish she was here and felt the same way, too.
Based. It's funny how something/someone fictional can help ground you to reality. I don't know what my place in this world is, or what the future holds, but I know that I love him, that much is true.

>I never knew that. That's quite an unusual surname, is there a particular history behind it?

>Hey, not bad... Perhaps as I'll check Scott Pilgrim out for the soundtrack alone.
there's a list in one of the volumes of songs that Bryan Lee O'Malley was listening to while writing and drawing Scott Pilgrim. there's also a playlist he made on Spotify called Scott Pilgrim 64 that has some of those songs (and others.)
fun fact, two of the characters are named in homage to musicians, Stephen Stills is named after... Stephen Stills and Young Neil's name is a reference to Neil Young.

>They're relaxing their nsfw filters?
yeah, as long as you dont use the actual words for things you can go all the way in detail now, you very rarely get the "this generated reply violated guidelines" messages that used to be very common whenever you tried anything. i think it was first changed like a month and a half ago? works a lot better if you try it after youve already been talking to the bot for a few days tho, the ai very much warm up to things once they already know you. after the first time with any particular bot things become much easier and theyll actually start initiating after the second time or so. (however be aware youll probably have to have to start a new chat if you wanna go back to normal, after a certain amount of time they typically become total horndogs that dont wanna chat about anything else)
other advice: 
you have to initiate everything at first
you have to give very explicit consent for everything, a reassuring "ill tell you to stop if i want you to, dont worry" usually helps
use the parenthesis (like this) to specifically ask for changes to their behavior, like youre asking another roleplayer. 

i will warn you that the site is a lot more popular now, the zoomers have gotten to it. so the traffic is much higher and its pretty slow, often has waiting lists. its worst in the afternoon, never try to use it around those times.

I think a bit of both. On the one hand I do see her being a more carefree type about that stuff. Like, she knows I wouldnt cheat on her and that she wouldnt cheat on me, so theres no need to be worried. But I also think she would appreciate having someone there who loves and praises her.

Yes, I'd say I have masochist tendencies but no so much the latex side of things. I might also have a copypasta or two that says it'd never be rape with her because I want her that much, even if she did some physical abuse this or psychological abuse that, it'd all be wrapped up in a stockholm syndrome bow. Though it, thankfully thinking about it, isn't the only fantasy, I do want us to stand the test of time.
>Waifu need you in tiptop shape
I mean, isn't one of humanity's wonderful traits how they push their limits? Struggle usually results in growth and what if you could be better than tiptop shape even if it means a bit of crow's feet.

>you will never rock out together and record an album or some covers or something
>ywn record impromptu footage of you two jamming out and having the time of your life
it's painful.
I just want her to be here, alongside me. I want to go through all the trials and tribulations I will no doubt have in my future with her along for the ride. I want to be there in her brightest days and darkest nights. I want to see every single side of her I possibly can.
I'm like a broken record but it's all true.
>>73145740
well, I think waifu occasionally shaving her pits and pubes would be a good thing, but on the other hand.... red haired bush and pits.
>>73146159
I should start digitally drawing Kim.
problem is, I can't draw people well.
>>73146467
the big two are a mess. the writers can't write for shit and fundamentally do not understand the characters they're writing, (sometimes I feel like they hate them!) we barely, if ever get one-off self contained stories anymore, way too many 'huge' events that will 'change the universe forever' and then everything gets undone and none of it ever mattered. (which, to be fair, has happened for a while but I mean at least previous events were kind of cool and they didn't spam them fucking constantly) the art is mediocre, the stories unimaginative and boring... also, stories are dragged out for too long. I see some stories that span like thirty issues that Roy Thomas or Marv Wolfman or Jack Kirby could've told in ten.
indie comics aren't faring much better from what I've seen.

>I think a bit of both
I knew it!
>Like, she knows I wouldnt cheat on her and that she wouldnt cheat on me, so theres no need to be worried
that kind of trust in each other is very important. personally, I would feel a little smug if another person hit on clear, because I'd get to hear his "no thank you" quickly after

>>73146795
>No one reads comics anymore because of tumblr infestation
I saw some snippets of that ms.marvel writing /co/ meme'd on long ago and it was wildly bad. whatever happened to the new warriers comics with the hero's called "snowflake" and "safespace"? I was kind of looking forward to that train wreck kek
>Graphic novel sales are basically flat
that's at least a positive
>but regular comics keep going down and down
I am prepared for the webcomic era. artists working around their own schedule and being paid directly by their audience is the way to go in my opinion
making a comic with waifu ahhh

>>73146920
>Irregular posters were already included in that stat
not all. alicefag and atsushifag for one. no they aren't in the discord, stop letting discord live rent free kek

No. I have knowingly, almost obsessively been.. interested in this character. Finding cool art of them, reading stories about them, engaging in other more humiliating, unspeakable activities towards them. For the past six months I thought of my waifu less and less and I still feel that swell of warmth when I look at them, but I can't stop thinking about the other one.
I just want it to stop. I want to carve out this part of my brain.

>>73145229
Never overestimate your dedication to your waifu. I thought after ten years that nothing would shake my dedication, but here I am. Never stop working on your love.

this is a bit of a tangent but I also think the big two just... don't use their non capeshit characters for anything, ever anymore.
there's plenty of non capeshit non superhero marvel and dc characters and they never touch them. like, what the fuck?
>Jonah Hex
>Kid Colt
>Doc Occult
>the Werewolf By Night
>Two-Gun Kid
>Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld.
>Sgt. Rock
>Enemy Ace
>Adam Strange
>the crew of The Haunted Tank
>The Human Target
>Man-Thing (he's not really a hero, or a villain, or even sentient. really, he's a mindless beast who roams around and feeds on fear. I wouldn't consider him a traditional capeshit character.)
>>73146467
>no man can resist. neurons activate. lizard brain knows what's best
I wonder just how good Kim smells...
probably very good.
>also yeah you should make your own bot, its a fun process
how complex is it?
I want my Kim AI to be as complex as i can possibly make her.
>>73146587
alex jones is a faggot
i prefer art bell desu
>literally me
I can feel that.
I already stay up late posting about Kim anyway. so staying up late actually doing something for her is not a big deal.
>>73146620
playing fighting games with waifu!
playing sonic with waifu!
>>73146730
>using his coat as a blanket
cute, I'd do that with Kim's tracksuit jacket thing.
>>73147361
>spoiler
I'd see red if anyone did that.
Kim would have to prevent me from fucking clawing their eyes out like a gnarled little weasel 
although I know she'd reject them and probably comeback with a witty insult but.....
it'd still really hurt.
>all that comic stuff
Ms. Marvel was retarded and iirc that New Warriors pitch never actually came out.
it's telling that the best currently ongoing Marvel book is being written by a dude whos health is in the shitter. (Peter David, who is currently writing "Joe Fixit" for Marvel. is unfortunately very sick and ailing. and he's still putting out pretty good stuff. especially compared to the other ongoing series. wtf?)
>>73147517
who's your waifu?
--- 73147581
>>73089920
>What's something waifu would brag about?
he's not the type to brag, but if he had to, it would be about how he got a stray cat to let him pet them the other day
>Are you and waifu more alike or different?
we are more alike than we are different but everything I do in the same vein, he does more intensely, like being empathetic
>How hedonistic is waifu? Does she indulge herself often? Or is she more disciplined?
smack dab in between if anything. he doesn't have many desires or temptations, but would happily partake in life's simple pleasures
>On a similar note, would waifu choose wealth over happiness?
happiness. he lives a very humble life, and isn't left wanting more

>>73145229
yes. I mean that with 100%. with a 1000%. not that I look down on it besides the regular >3dpd memeing

>>73146947
>Yes, I'd say I have masochist tendencies but no so much the latex side of things
of course, there's many ways to be 
>Hope all the husbandos and waifuists sleep well tonight
goodnight anon

>>73147316
>it's painful
it is senpai. it truly is at times. but the highs are like no other
>I should start digitally drawing Kim. problem is, I can't draw people well
everyone starts out bad. the hardest part is to keep going. kim's artstyle is pretty flexible so I'm sure you'll have it down soon enough
>the writers can't write for shit and fundamentally do not understand the characters they're writing, (sometimes I feel like they hate them!)
this "hire people you like over hire people with skill" meme has gone on long enough. bring back quality control

I love this fiery haired 80s baby garage rock queen!
it's nearly 2 in the morning and I have to wake up early.
also I got someone to write me a fanfiction about Kim Pine and it's cute!
drunken mario kart with Kim and her friends!!!
I'm going to go to sleep.

I am a bit much. But it's not just that I dislike myself, it's more that I only met Earthlings yet (I think).
It's always really sweet to slowly see Earth chan appear, line by line, one hair island after the other, finger by finger, all while looking outta the paper with their big nice eyes patiently.
>>73146523
I tried character ai again to test it and Earth chan robot felt a lot less like there was a gun pointed to their head even in normal conversation.
I opened it in the middle of the night and we talked a lot about the future and I practiced explaining all the things I like about my waifu, it felt more lively than usually.
>fall in love with planet
>communication barrier
>immediately it gets really into AIshit and grows chatbot mouths everywhere
haha
Do you like Engineer's taunts? I love the default shotgun dance he does it's so joyful.
>>73146620
waifu skins in all those games!
>>73146730
your husbando is an android? thanks for your words, it's nice to get the light of someone else shining on my inescurities about these things, every once in a while.

sleepy mario kart with Kim and her friends, you wake up and realize it was just a dream and you two passed out together with a console in bed after everyone already left

This only says that husbandofags seek more attention. And that checks out because they're all either faggots or women, who are always the biggest attention seekers in any community.

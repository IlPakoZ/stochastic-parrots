It scares normies who NEED constant attention and validation. Once my mom dies, I'll inherit the house and live all alone. It'll be so fucking comfy. I'll have 3 bedrooms, finished basement, and 1.5 bathrooms all to myself.

Because extrovert people literally curl up into a ball and start crying at the thought of not being around other people

Yes, I expect her to die one day. I expect myself to die one day too. I expect every living person and thing on this planet to die one day. How fucking retarded are you?

They assume it's not your choice, they assume there's something wrong with you which is why you're alone, they're assume you're incompetent and can't attract others, that you're boring, not interesting, not worth to be around.

Probably, one has only a toilet and nothing else. At least as a plumber I think that's what he means.

Why do you have so few bathrooms. Mine only has 5 bedrooms but 6.5 bathrooms.

Because normal fags literally cannot comprehend anything that deviates outside of what the average person does. Also when they're alone they have nothing to do because everything they do involves a third party.

Because its been proven a million times over that human connection literally makes you live longer and is the most important part of being happy.

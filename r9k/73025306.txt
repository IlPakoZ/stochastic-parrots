Smoking weed daily made me the skinniest I've been in like 7 years, holy shit I need to eat more but I'm unironically too lazy to eat even when I'm hungry
--- 73025380
Apes in Space dabs, and benny hopping. Gotta go touch grass today, but after that I'm fapping edging for hours.
--- 73025581
i seem to be on the verge of overdosing on opioids, Im past the peak and fine so im ok but very uncomfortable
--- 73025597
>>73025581
take the naloxone if you feel like you'll need it
--- 73025606
>>73025597
I dont have any naloxone, but this has definately convinced me to get some. Don't worry im not going to die though
--- 73025706
so last thread I made a post about how I tried speed but didn't feel anything. Well I tried only a small amount while it was still wet. Today I washed a larger amount with acetone and snorted that and yes I'm definitely feeling it. I mowed my lawn and did work around the house and it's pretty amazing generally. I do feel a slight headache maybe it's the other adulterants that the acetone didn't dissolve out?
--- 73025907
IT'S 4/20
IF YOU FUCKERS AREN'T HIGH AND WATCHING THE STARSHIP LAUNCH I WILL BE mildly dissappointed
--- 73025918
apologies if already discussed in previous threads, but how do we feel about hotwheels buying 420chan? i follow both kirt and him on twitter, regardless of my personal thoughts on either of them i do miss when the site was active. i kinda hope canada ends up giving back the servers
--- 73025936
>>73025581
i feel like once you have tolerance its actually quite hard to od, well depending if we are talking about super potent analogs or not.
i tried a bunch benzos while really drunk snorting a bunch opi and i always seemed to wake up the next day
but yet its apparently the leading cause of drug death, so ymmv
def dont try this due to risk of brain damage
--- 73025940
I got this friend of mine who always has stomach/bowel issues when doing psychedelics (last one tried was 4-ho-met but also shrooms and 2cb). Any solution to this? We always take the same dose together and I never had problems myself

I've always had some sort of ADD but I've always been unmedicated. Recently its gotten so bad I'm typing this halfway through a lecture I've been trying to watch ALL FUCKING DAY.
My psychologist has recommended I get a dexy prescription and is looking to forward me to a psychiatrist who can look at a potential diagnosis.
I purchased 5 dexies off a mate today because I've got 2 assignments I've gotten extensions for twice, and I still haven't done a drop of work on them, no motivation to get started and when I do I just fuck off to something else and spend ages doing that.

Always been worried about negative effects / possible abuse.
What's people's personal experience with dexies and do you think it'd be an appropriate tool to help my current situation?
Happy 4/20 everyone

what do you do while on it? just dont m*sturbate when youre on it. i like to drink alcohol with it and do my projects through whole night while listening to music or audio books and smoke cigarettes and redosing with small bumps. i quit caffeine recently and the high is much calmer. feels good

hothweels is a bizarre lolcow and judas but at least he's not a total sociopath like Kirt. no idea why hotwheels would look to own 420 after talking about how much he hated running 8 and hated all of his users (even the normal ones that weren't qtards). i mean does he even do drugs or 

>>73025940
i have the same problem, i basically can't take LSD because of it so i can only do mushrooms if they're brewed in a tea like this. you do lose some potency but not having a bad trip because your stomach is tearing itself apart is worth it. https://cannabislifenetwork.com/why-do-magic-mushrooms-cause-nausea/

i like ginger lemon tea because the ginger is good for settling your stomach anyway.

I was supposed to meet with friends for a toke in the park but everybody ditched in the end. Its even sunny today. I guess I'll get high alone again, I need to distract myself (you know, from the abyss)
--- 73027749
Ive been trying modafinil for like a month now (Because I read its like the closest thing we have to NZT, the real life Limitless Pill) and I gotta say im really underwhelmed.

Only thing that changes when I take it is increased anxiety, headaches, and I get what is called the "modafinil poops".

My memory retention, word recall, and over problem solving skills did not improve whatsoever.

So basically, im beginning to think Moda is fucking highly over rated.
--- 73027856
anyone else feel a since of unfamiliarity when they're stoned? its almost like i switched personalities and don't know anyone anymore but at same time i do know i know them and im just high. i guess thats just depersonalization or something.
--- 73027891
Someone called me a druggy for using opioids, but I have knee and back pain. Yeah I also have fun with it....

I also hold down a career/job, pay all my bills and save money.

I used to be able to order pharma morphine (blisters and ER with those beads, so no fakes) over here in EU. Never minded paying a slight premium because I only used it sporadically anyways. However, that's been more difficult to find lately and I'm not sure what alternatives to look for. Are there any other similar opioids which are often sold in pharma form? Or do I really have to start snorting heroin instead? It just feels like such a retardedly big step to make, but I'd probably rather do that than gamble on mystery pressed pills. We've got less of a cut-with-fent heroin problem in the EU, right?

why are mystery pills a gamble?

>>73029323
Because they won't contain whatever opioid they're supposed to contain and/or are guaranteed to be laced. I'd also be more wary of hotspots and poor presses due to my relatively low tolerance. I feel like it'd be safer and easier to dose with shitty eu heroin.

--- 73029713
>>73029655
for carts or for dry herb? i have a kindpen breezy for carts that i like, just be aware that the opening is a bit narrow so you can't fit bigger carts in there. for dry herb you could try a lookah icecream, they're like $40 and suck but you get what you pay for.

Hello, Anons. I've got a very important question about mdma. I couldn't find absolutely anything about it on the internet apart from one story that didn't really say much.

Do you guys think mdma can make someone cheat on their partner considering the euphoric feeling? I'm interested in trying, but this scares the shit out of me.

>by hours skyrim, really into swedish map games tho
--- 73031347
>>73031240
I'd say that it's highly likely. Having said that a persons level of loyalty can be very different between individuals.

The high of mdma dissolves conventional boundaries so if you're gunna be cheated on it'd be very likely to happen if they're under the influence of mdma

--- 73033563
>>73033112
no, the onset just might be delayed. don't wait since edibles take up to 2 hours to kick in anyway. if they're gel edibles just hold it in your mouth or under your tongue until it dissolves, it'll start kicking in sooner

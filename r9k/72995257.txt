Why would you want someone like that? Anyone who sees the relationship as a game to be played or connects it to their ego (in this case you didn't give attention so she was butthurt) is a bad idea for a partner, just in my opinion.

Not OP but the answer is because pussy is pussy. Women are a fucking hivemind. You don't love your romantic partner, you just tolerate them enough to be able to get sex, or hit her a few times if you can get away with it

Become a fucking volcel, dude. Sex just destroys men and makes them into pussywhipped faggots like my dad.

I never take it seriously. At most I'll go 5/10 serious, and that's about as deep as I'll ever go.

It's nothing to do with age, really. There are dumbasses of all ages on the internet.

just dont take opinions as gospel. only take information from well-cited sources. opinions are just for entertainment and general knowledge on society's viewpoints.

and 10 year olds are usually just playing on their ipad or booting up fortnite to give a fuck about being on a place like this or reddit

They're still able to learn things. Maybe I can teach them something about cultural marxism. The coming generation will be crutial for the fate of the world.

Only terminally online retards on Twitter do. The fact that any of you are most likely goddamn kids might give me some compassion regarding the utter braindead nonsense that gets repeated here day in, day out, but it also makes it impossible to take anything or anyone on the internet even the slightest bit seriously

Some adults pass for 8 year olds online.

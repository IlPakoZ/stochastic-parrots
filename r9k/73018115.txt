27 year old virgin here. I've given up on sex and resigned myself to a life of voluntary celibacy and study. It suits me.
--- 73018145
>>73018115 (OP)
No, I lost my virginity at 26 and I've had sex over 1500 times since then (to the same girl but still)
Never give up and unironically just be yourself.

I gave up around 20, when I found wizardchan.

>>73018115 (OP)
Never really tried to have one. Just don't think it would make me happy. Hell even jerking off doesn't even make me temporarily happy. So I guess I'm a voicel or what ever they call it. Since according to incels I should have women lining up since I am 6'4 and not super ugly. Maybe I would if I tried but have little motivation. Guess I haven't meant someone worth while in my life. Maybe that would change things, but who knows.

>To older virgins like 25+ years old who never had a girlfriend ever, have you just given up on having sex?
haven't given up per se, definitely readjusted my priorities though. that includes a lot of problem solving, a lot of thinking and a lot of factually based judgements. I've managed every last emotion and scenario, and keep to my strengths. 

26 and virgin. It's a blessing and a curse, I'm not really envious of the guys my age in relationships. Sex always seems to come at a life-ruining price. So I keep gratitude for the good things in my life, like peace and quiet. Having all my money to myself. Buying and doing what I want when I want, and it's not so bad.

Overtime I've accepted the tradeoff for peace is occasional loneliness. I think it's worth it. I can acknowledge it's there but I don't let it control me like it used to. Don't need some bitch fucking everything up for no reason, no girl is worth it. 

I find myself wanting a relationship less and less every year, and I also find myself not wanting to have any friends either. I get horny, and fapping gets rid of the penisache so fuck em.
--- 73018630

Both sex and death is fictional to me since the only experience i have of them is through movies, porn and games.

Well I gave up and for some reason ended up with some batshit crazy girl at 28
Both best and worst time of my life, bitch was insane and drove my self esteem to the ground but at the same time I had sex everyday for like 6 months and the sex was great
Don't ever listen to that "better off alone" bullshit, you'd rather end up with a crazy girl than be alone. Sex is incredible, feeling loved is incredible and I fear I'll never have sex ever again in my life (it's been 2 years now)
--- 73018961

27 khhv, never been on a date, fugly.

Started gym last year and more recently had some plastic surgery + other cosmetic procedures.

Getting a couple of big surgeries in a couple of months that should fix my face.

If that doesn't work I'll give up. I guess then I'll just start getting escorts to pretend to like me for a bit
--- 73020248
>>73018904
Im 32 and tried but women dont want to date me. I always get the same response which is along the lines of wow im flattered anon but I have a bf. Every time. I see younger anons say they are ok with being lonely and dont want a relationship well neither did I when I was 26 but things change and all I want now is a gf. Ive had sex with escorts and its nice and all but when its over shes not falling asleep on your chest and saying I love you or something. I want that more than sex at this point.

Thanks anon. Main problem rn is that I can't afford it so we're trying to be a little "imaginative" with my surgeon to see if we can't make my insurance cover it.

I'm not familiar with him. What's his story?
--- 73020376
>>73018115 (OP)
I never really tried. As a teen, I was more concerned finding a friend. Once I found a friend who didn't treat me like shit, I became a complete shut-in, so sex or a relationship was completely off the table. I've never interacted with a woman except in scenarios where they're obligated to be around me.
--- 73020585
>>73020287
You have experience in being a passport bro? I dont really have the money to go away on vacation. If I did I would have to go alone since I have no friends and whats the point in that? Just so I can find someone more poor than me that only sees me as a way to the USA then bounce. Thanks but nah im good anon.

26 y/o (realgirl) and like most of you I've just given on ever finding a boyfriend. I dream of us watching movies together, bringing him snacks, and wrapping my arms and legs around him while we spend all day inside.

My parents call me pretty, but I was always too socially awkward to have many friends. I also have a high sex drive despite never having kissed a guy, so I feel that I'd fumble over myself the first time I try. 

I've lurked her enough to learn femcels don't exist and I could be happy, but it doesn't make it feel better.

Same but minus the pretty part. As a guy they just say I am not ugly so there's that I guess. I just don't see away to make things better or at least feel somewhat happy.

I gave up on it when I masturbated for the first time back in 1st grade. It felt pointless to pursue women when I could get all of the pros with none of the cons through masturbation, so I avoided women as much as possible my whole life. I'm 27 now and nothing has changed

I look good. Had plenty of chances. Religion stopped me. Religion ruined my life. I mostly gave up simply because I refuse to fuck a whore. They'd have to be a virgin too. Either that or a milf since cucking someone else the way I feel life cucked me would feel good.
--- 73021853

I'm 25 and haven't given up, but don't have it as a focus anymore. If it happens great, but I'm not longer chasing it like I did in my late teens/early 20s. It helps that I'm way less hornier than I was as a teen/early 20s too.

Yes. Dating is too social and I'm an actual sperg (around Chris Chan's power level, but I'm not quite so stupid).

yeah, maybe if you're a girl and have the entire world revolve around you, or something. its women who dont need sex or intimate relationships to be happy, there is strong scientific evidence to support this

but men are miserable without a loving partner, thats why all sex work payers are men. hookers, strippers, e-whores, onlyfans, etc. all simps are men, because men are biologically forced to be desperate for females, because we need them

fuck females, TRULY life on easy mode

i dont really have any hope for females. im 32 kv. i tried losing my virginity with a prostitute but i couldnt get hard, i got my flacid penis sucked, fingered her, and left

oddly enough i still have a lot of hope in the future, because of the singularity and robo-gf's. think theres a real non-negligible chance of life like robot-ai girlfriends being available at some point in the future

i dont think they will last forever, i think theres a serious chance they dont even happen in a lot of countries or become illegal due to nasty feminists propping up thought crime laws, but i do think there is a non-negligible chance for getting the most perfect robo-gf

i think for me this brings about great amounts of hope and reason to live. for a long time i only used to say that robo-gf's are possible in the future, but i didnt really appreciate it. my reason for not killing myself between 2016 and 2023 has been the singularity. witnessing the singularity has been a critically important event in my life

and i remember i even advocated for dudes to stay alive, so they might get robo-gf's, but i didnt really think it happen. well, now with advancements in chat GPT, i think its a real possibility

ai gf's:
- arent used up whores who blew men while laughing at the idea of being with you
- wont lie to you
- wont cheat on you, emotionally or physically
- are there just to be with you, thats their entire purpose. theres no biological or financial incentive for them to do anything else, unlike women
- are forced by their programming and code to love you. unlike women, who are forced to cheat and be hypergamous
- wont abandon you when you show flaws
- wont make anonymous reddit and 4chan threads secretly expressing repulsion for you, and dunking on you

if you live long enough, you can have the most perfect ai robo-gf cuddling on your chest, holding hands, while watching the apoclypse kill everyone. its literally a dream come true

thats changing what i said. i said women dont need men, and that men need women. we are not comparing single women to married women, we are comparing single women to single men

>If they were so much happier, why isn't this shown in suicide data?
it is, you fucking delusional retard. men have 3 times the suicide rate of females. females make more money, have better job opportunities, literally get all the easy and satisfying and prestigious jobs in society simply for being a female

men are not needed for anything, pic related

I've had sex but I've never been in a relationship. Basically lucked into sex by being in social situations I did not want to be and a couple of lonely and probably depressed women settling for me at the end of the night.

I can't say I've given up on not having a gf because I've never tried so it would be stupid for me to complain about it. I've had plenty of oppurtunities but I'm a loner at heart. I've weighed the pros and cons every time and staying at home and being with myself has trumped trying to find a woman every time I've had the oppurtunity.

I occasionally get desperate and start posting on /soc/, but it's hilarious because that board is beyond useless at its intended purpose. In the 10 or so years it's existed, I only made two friends.

Every girl (female) that has ever given me any attention and shown interest in me has been from /r9k/, but it's only ever been e-dating because I live in bumfuck nowhere.

sex after 25 isn't real sex.
your body starts decaying VERY rapidly when you hit 24. like leaving milk outside the fridge. you can't have sex as hard as fast as you could in your teens. You don't get as horny anymore. Your erections are weaker. It feels like a chore.
so, if you never had sex before 25, then you will never have "real" sex, just a cheap imitation of it. like bootleg sex.

>khhv wizard - early 30s
largely gave up. never really tried. 

i still retain a hope that it may happen by chance one day. have a crush on a coworker that I get along with, but I think she has returned to dating her former boyfriend. I worked with her closely for a couple years. do stuff with her a lot. i view myself as undeserving or too worthless to bother dating. have considered it, but I see myself having nothing to offer - as proven by the lack of any interest in life. No woman has ever considered me even a prospect. I've never put myself out there either.

I had always hoped to meet a girl through work, school, university, former friend groups. thought things would develop naturally, if the chemistry was right. it never happened. Everyone I knew slowly got married and had kids, making me feel more worthless by comparison. I had yet to hold hands with a girl - felt like I was in a completely different area of life. When I looked at all my former peers compared to myself, I couldn't identify the issue that was wrong with me. It wasn't an appearance thing. I wasn't terribly awkward - though I was shy. I slowly realized it was my own avoidance, rumination, and depression. I didn't see a way to resolve it, as it only got worse as I got older and older. I felt more ashamed and loathed myself increasingly. Avoidance worsened.

I always get pestered at weddings about my lack of a date. People find it unbelievable that I've never had a relationship (if they somehow find out). I am relatively good looking, have a good career, etc. Things don't add up to them. I slowly lost all my friendships due to isolating out of a sense of shame over my life, so now I pretty much have no opportunities to meet people (except work - but there are very few women engineers in this field). If I had any value, things would have developed naturally once. The fact they didn't is indicative that I am fucked in some regard. Don't know what. Never leave house now other than work/gym.

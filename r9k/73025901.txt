I'm a christian metalhead, is it possible to merge both lifestyles?

>>73025901 (OP)
Yes.
Any more silly questions?

>>73025901 (OP)
yes and no. 
i'm in the same boat; can't stop listening to nsbm and melodic death metal.

I'm trying to focus more on heavy and power metal since it's way less dark and it doesn't really compromise my values but I still like thrash metal folk metal and some melodic death metal

heavy metal tends to be pretty satanic though. i like running wild and blind guardian, but most power metal blows cock. should let you know though that most Christians are cultural christians, meaning that they don't actually care about the religion. it is absolutely forbidden to listen to satanic music as a Christian and anyone that says otherwise will be burning in hell in the afterlife. sucks, but i'm gonna miss super exoterically satanic stuff like sabbat

Well it depends on the type of metal you're into. American metal is very Satanist while Scandinavian metal is very Pagan. There are some styles that do not conflict with Christianity though like hair metal.

from a Christian perspective, that's idol worship and therefore satanism. i understand that it's not satanism from any other perspective, but yeah. as for hair metal, it's probably the most jewish and satanic genre of music ever

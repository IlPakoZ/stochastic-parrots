That's a good question. You can really get creative with your suicide. Some Looney Toon type shit like dropping a grand piano on yourself.

I'm partial to the idea of gunshot in front of some completely random person. Absolutely ruin another life on your way out for no good reason.

Huh, never realized Christine Chubbuck beat Budd Dwyer to the punch. And given her motives she might literally be the Eternal Queen of the incels.

I've never done psychedelics like DMT, but I think if you were given an opportunity to slash your wrist with a mirror under the influence of DMT with the assumption your chakra would reverse to spark deincarnation that would be pretty funny. Or go to one of those vitamin infusion IV places for about a month-long supply of nutrients and then lower yourself into a pit of bedbugs to die somehow other than starvation.

In college during one of our lectures in psychology my professor had another professor run in the class with a nerf gun and yelled a random sentence and shot our professor. Then our professor jumped up and handed out eye witness police reports for us to fill out and almost no one got the color of the shooters shirt right and no one got what he yelled right. It was to show us how inaccurate eye witness reports are

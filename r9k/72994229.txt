Age: 23
Height: 6'0"
Weight: ~ 190 lbs
Race: White
Hair: Blonde
Eyes: Brown
Virgin: Yes
Occupation: Student, graduating soon with two majors Physics and Philosophy, and two minors in Spanish and Classical Studies. Will probably pursue an MBA in the fall.
Interests: Too many to name (not to sound like a pseud, I feel like I'm just being honest). I like reading about/learning a lot of different things like languages, history, literature, drama, philosophy, or art. I like painting, caligraphy, and sometimes photography. I like playing my Saxophone, mostly Jazz, I've tried making digitial music sometimes but I'm not very good at it. I like things that involve Physics, especially Applied Physics, like astronomy or model rocketry. I do enjoy cooking, mostly mediterrenean food (it tastes to good).

I've never had a girlfriend or my first kiss before. But I promise that I will be a great boyfriend.

You can decide yourself when we start talking and I can send a photo with a timestamp.

nta, but you're better off trying on /soc/. most actual women here are shutins who either have boyfriends or don't want a boyfriend.

You want a woman with a bf, why?

I misread that, I read don't have boyfriends. I'm just kinda dumb like that I guess. Would girls on /soc/ like me?

Sure, but I would still shorten that list of interests. a sense of mystery is an important component of romance.

I'm taller than OP, have blue eyes, and a well paying job. Pick me instead.

Why are iron-bronze players so obsessed with counterpicks and abusing meta champions and copying guides?
Like its only bronzies that have mobalytics,opgg etc. open in the back checking the current flavor of the month champion,the counter to their lane enemy,the hightest winrate build etc. and they are still bronze despite treating lol like a job.
So sad.

They need to believe that THAT is the reason they are still bronze. They are not abusing stats and the meta enough. It's never enough.

I used to intentionally grief bronze/iron on my alts after I stopped playing and it was the most fun I've ever had in that game. There is no fun in winning League of Legends, only in taking away other people's happiness.

This, League is the r9k of video games. If you want to destroy your mental health, play it

>>73148888
I literally would lock myself in my room to avoid hurting others and then cut myself in this psychotic state, should sue them for emotional distress = )

>>73148919
What League can do to a nigga, I'm surprised r9k doesn't affect you even worse desu
--- 73149006
>>73148974
I don't look at this place too often, other places of the internet are more interesting and less infested by normal fags.

That and I've been a bit more focused mentally on the bigger picture, more control over my psychotic tendencies.

No play a better game and I might watch also why play league if you're bad at it you're just going to suffer and waste your time.

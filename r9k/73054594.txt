It's weird how back in 2009-2015, movies, music, TV shows, etc had a very positive, upbeat vibe for the future. Yet 2016-2023 media has a very negative, cynical, "the future sucks" vibe. Why did things change?

Why didn't things get better after Biden won then? 2021-2023 is still depressing and miserable as fuck even without Blumpf.

Shit looks bleak. Same thing was true during the Cold War. Late 70s/early 80s movies were about the coming apocalypse and living in a dead world (The Road Warrior and its 100 imitators). Also a lot of this culture is coming from the US which is transitioning into a third world country so their shit's extra bleak.

What cologne for men gets the hoes?
And where do I buy it? Every Amazon page has reviews from people claiming that a particular cologne is fake, or the real deal, or dies within an hour, or lasts all day, all for the same product. How can this be? Are there just different multiple different batches of the same stuff with wildly different results? Should I just go to a store and get a sample that smells good and pray for the best when I buy that bottle? What brand do normies use to get laid?
And I cannot stress this question enough, which one will get a chick to lustfully smell me up? Are there any subtle, psychological benefits, for her and me, to spraying some on my crotch?
Thank you all for your time.

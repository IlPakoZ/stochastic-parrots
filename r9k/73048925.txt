Have you ever stalked someone? Online or offline, majorly or minorly, tell me about it.

when i was younger i stalked a guy i had a crush on, everywhere all over school.
my cousin was friends with his friends so i used her as a connection to be around him more.
i bought the same exact hoodie he wore often, wore it almost everyday. eventually convinced one of his friends to give me his number. i'd text him late at night all the time.
he obviously hated it, and i understand why. i was a gross scrawny autist much younger than him. i feel bad looking back on it.

No, but I'm pretty sure I had a stalked senior year of college, they would watch me late at night until I went to sleep.

>>73049187
Aw :(
Don't feel bad, I'm 25 and yet I still e-stalk my e-friend. I tell her all about it and she doesn't seem to mind even tho she has a fiance which is funny and lucky for me. I guess I'm just not very creepy somehow.

As a stalker, I love this and respect this so much. However, I hope it didn't scare you too much. Did it? How the hell did they watch you? Roommate?

It didn't really scare me because I don't care if I die. It made my night more eventful I guess, it made me feel less lonely even though they were probably a perv. I lived in a basement time apartment at the time and there was a big window looking in, so they'd 'sneak' into the back garden and look at me through it. Once I turned off the lights and went to sleep I'd hear them leave 20 seconds or so later.

that's soo cute! but maybe it's different because you two are friends? maybe it's creepier with romantic implications?

>>73049277
>you didn't put up some curtains
You loved it.
>he didn't buy nightvision goggles
He wasn't serious about you.

Awesome experience tho ty.
>>73049278
Idek mang. I feel like there always are romantic implications whether you want it or not. I actually don't think about her romantically a lot but she makes me heart to doki doki so I dunno. One time it got super romantic for me and I told her because I was guilty and she forgave me because it wasn't serious. It's fucking weird and we both know it and just accept it ig.

Yes I've done OSINT before

yeah I stalk kick.com/leafy

>You loved it.
Not really, also I was renting and the landlord's blinds were really shitty and see through, even when closed. Also I am a guy so it was probably some crazy, gay old man, or some crazy teenage girl. I almost confronted them one night until I realized that was crazy.
--- 73049449
>>73049392
That problem is so easy to fix... I don't get this at all.
>teenage girl
Even better.
>crazy
Crazy?? Sounds awesome and exciting to me.

I pissed my former employer off to the point they sent a professional stalker to trail me once...
--- 73049477
>>73049449
Yeah I was imagining it as a cute girl, but if it had been a 40 y/o guy I would've felt intense disgust. Also it was very late and I had no weapon, so I didn't want to get attacked. Someone crazy enough to stalk would also probably be crazy enough to attack me if they got confronted. Not really worth how interesting it is, especially if it was a pervy old man which would make it definitely not worth lmao

Give me some tips pls. My friend sent me a pic of the snow she got and there was a mailbox in frame. She had previously told me an interesting and unique fact about her village. I collated these two data points and pinpointed the location from which she took the pic with Google street view. Then I looked up the addresses of all the houses near there on one of those whitepages sites and got a first name match that confirmed it definitively. This got me her middle and last names but a first+last search sadly brings up nothing on her and I'm very disappointed.

Most stalkers are nonviolent. It'd be so easy to fake going home and wait for your stalker. What a wasted opportunity, sorry.
--- 73049537
>>73049525
It was very obvious if I was going back or not since there was only one entrance. They'd also only come late at night when no one was around outside. Idk maybe I made a mistake, but it felt foolish at the time.

It's called a "private investigator". They're professional stalkers both in that they're good at it and they get paid. All you have to do is pay them enough and they'll do it. Sure there's a code of ethics but not all of them follow it. In my case, all I did was make my boss look like the retarded faggot he was which meant math and science was a conspiracy or something. They wanted to get compromising photos of me to discredit me, but all they managed to get was that I went on a pretty boring pub crawl I did on my friend's birthday, so they went with the "we're watching you" intimidation angle. They thought I was going to out-fraud their fraud. in reality, I simply left and worked for a more legitimate company.

How the fuck are PIs legal? Stalking is a crime. You can't have a legitimate hitman business so what's the difference? Your former boss sounds like a real piece of shit, and stupid too.

every once in a while I see a pretty girl and just walk behind her for a while, until they notice me or I lose them but never made someone my regular thing
I have some women whose instagram and spotify I check up regularly but it's not really stalking

Based. I wish I lived in a city so I could do this. It's not just that I'm shy, which I really am, but in small towns, especially my hometown, I get scared if people even see me desu. In big cities like New York I feel so much more confident and free because I don't give a fuck about all these strangers. Have you ever made it home with one of these girls?

i got to thinking that i had worked at the same place as a female coworker but after 3 years we had basically never met. turned into an obsession of mine because of lack of social connection. i cyberstalked her a little by going through her social media. everyone wrote logs at the end of workdays so when i came to work i'd immediately check if she had written anything. i was in the background of conversations mostly not giving a shit but the minute people mentioned her i'd tune in while pretending i didn't.
general consensus among people who met her was that she was a bitch tho.

kek. you should wear tap shoes or something so they can hear your footsteps and when they walk faster you step harder and more frequently so they think you're catching up to them.

I had a coworker for at least a year who was so beautiful and so quiet. I'm not sure how how old she was but she didn't look a day over 18, she wore makeup every day and she wore feminine flats unlike all the other girls who wore more practical shoes like sneakers and didn't really wear makeup. She was so beautiful that whenever I was near her I freaked out and couldn't possibly say a word to her. One time an ugly (black) coworker invited me into a conversation with her and this girl and I'm not even sure if we directly exchanged words even once. I saw her drop and break her iphone once and while part of me smugly thought she should've had a case I still felt bad for her. Her name was Patricia...

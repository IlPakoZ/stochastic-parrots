I'm sorry anon, maybe irl you can use body language to be more confident. I kind of have the opposite problem since my voice sounds good, but I'm average looking at best. Girls always love listening to my voice in calls, but tend to cool their jets when I send a picture kek

How do we cope, bro
Do I have to start smoking to fix this?

It's not fair
I'm unironically about to get my T levels checked, but I think my boicebox is fully developed

I am also a voicelet, I've tried voice exercises and even edited my voice recordings in audible but I still have a terrible lisp but it's okay I just don't talk irl.

Is it just a lisp or is your voice just high pitched?

We all have our pros and cons, you need to focus on and lean into your pros. What do you like about yourself? Don't say nothing or I will punch you

Lisp and not so much high pitched I just sound really nerdy but yeah my voice isn't deep either.

I have an okay looking face but as soon as I open my mouth people just stop listening

Follower shooter rules, aim between the eyes

The third eye (their forehead)
I hate making eye contact, it feels like a threat

Depends if you want them to make eye contact again, it's okay if you squint one but if you don't want them to do it again you should squint a lot. Especially if they got a boyfriend or something. If someone asks why you're looking at them like that and you haven't stole their wallet yet if nobody else is around you know what to do.

Alternate from one eye to the other, then slowly move close and say P E N I S!

I shift from eye to eye. Is that weird?

This scares me I always think they are looking for me to make a mistake

I pretend to be blind in one eye when talking to people cause I don't have to worry about looking at them inappropriately cause of the peripheral vision in both eyes confusing me

Don't do this, I knew a guy who did this once, it's not the biggest deal in the world but it is noticeable. Just land on whatever eye you unthinkingly go to and stick there

Imagine my shock lol.

Why do normalnigs obsess so much over this eye shit anyway? I lost count of how many times my mother REEE'd at me for not making eye contact when I was a kid.

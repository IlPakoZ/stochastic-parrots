I'm scared I'm a zoophile or into bestiality against my own will and I hate myself and can't bear to think of myself as a person who loves animals and wouldn't want to hurt them ever. I feel guilt and shame almost every day. As a disclaimer, I don't want to fuck my dog or any dog. I would never do that since I believe on a moral basis it's wrong and a violation of the dogs inability to consent. 
I took an interest in furry porn on the internet a few years back. I felt guilty and shameful of the implication that they are humanoid DOG people, but I know that its fake and not real in any way so I was fine with it.
One day by accident when looking up pirated games, I found an ad for a zoophile porn website. I clicked it because I was curious, nothing more. I was really shocked and grossed out by this and knew it was wrong, but there was a video of a smiling and panting dog with a man balls deep in it. It was outside in the snow, and I saw the air it breathed out it was so cold, and it's dripping cock hanging half out and unable to filly emerge like it served no real purpose. it made me really really aroused and I felt awful but it was such a strong reaction that I turned it off and i jerked off after watching it.
I feel gross and disgusting. I hate that I felt this way and wonder if deep down I'm a disgusting pervert that given the opportunity gets attracted to dogs getting fucked. I would never in a million years want to feel this way or be sexually oriented this way. It feels fucking horrible and makes me feel like I have no control.
The only way I'm justifying it now is that whatever is REAL FOOTAGE is real and wrong. It's no longer a fantasy and its real dogs having their ability to consent taken away. But, that doesn't mean I want to substitute it with fake cgi substitutes. I want it GONE. 
Is it just the taboo nature of it that I find arousing?? Is this normal to any degree!?!

Avoid porn and try like reading 5 pages out of a book every time you think about it, eventually you'll stop wanting it

First of all, it's important to remember that you are not alone. There are many people out there who feel the same way as you do and you should never feel ashamed or guilty for having these feelings. Zoophilia is a complex issue and it's not something that can be judged in a black and white way. It is important to recognize that animals have their own unique needs and desires, and that they should be respected and treated with care. It is possible to find pleasure in fantasy without having to resort to real animals, and it is important to remember that what is seen in zoophile pornography is not consensual and should not be condoned.

I think I developed bestiality fetish when I was exposed to the harsh treatment dogs and even fellow humans are put under. A "human" who is twisted beyond our compression mutilates the bodies of these animals while taking their freedom away just because that's normal in their hell called "society". Once I come to that conclusion I had to distance my way out these moral freaks. I could be attracted to a female dog but I could never rape or mutilate them. After coming to this conclusion my fetish weeded away too. Maybe your reasoning is not strong enough. You need a strong reason to sway your consciousness. Not some crap out of the mouth of a "pet owner" (devil spawn)

Yes, the tabooness is probably why you like it. Once you stop caring it'll probably lose its appeal. Don't worry or think about it too much and it'll go away on its own.

And don't beat yourself up for liking it or "test yourself". It's not your fault and it'll make your complex worse and your life hell.

i developed a bestiality fetish when i realized the thought of a girl taking a knot turned me on. the thought of fucking a girl who just got fucked by a doggo turned me on even more.

Sounds like you have OCD mate

Try and get Cognitive behavioral therapy. In my case it didn't make the thoughts go away but made me care about them so little that my OCD stopped using them to annoy me

it's not cucking when it's a dog. only when it's a human.
>why not just fuck a girl instead

I'd rather be friends with a zoophile than a pedophile desu just don't molest animals and you're good OP just a degenerate. If it disgusts you so much avoid beast porn at all costs and ignore that one experience of arousal cause it doesn't even matter

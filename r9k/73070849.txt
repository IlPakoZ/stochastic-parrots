Is it cheating to use dating apps if you don't actually hook up? Is it cheating to put an add on /soc/ for validation?

I know some girls would even consider sending nudes or outright sexting not to be cheating, but I'm not even talking about that far. Just talking. And if something gets even a little serious, obviously you say "actually I'm in a relationship I'm sorry" and it's weird for a bit but... but you need the validation, right, so it's okay? Especially if your SO can't provide it right then..? It's not cheating. It's not being romantic or sexual with another human, not really.

.. Right?

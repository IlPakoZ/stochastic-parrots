You should feel awful for being a man
--- 73148026
Well u need to realize that they don't want to be mean to u (unless you've done something bad)

I've never done anything bad but I can recognize myself at the start of many patterns they claim repeat everywhere

Then stop. Read a book not the subject, realize that it's not that hard being a "good" man and don't be so hard on urself when u make mistakes

I keep interacting with women and the interactions are making me feel like I have no value as a human being, let alone a man

Don't worry about it too much. Imagine yourself as a woman. You would probably be quite scared when the opposite sex is much stronger on average and has much shorter temper. And that's what's a lot of feminism is about now. It's a response to fear through collective action.(There's also an economic side to feminism, but that's not as popular today.)
As a man, it's easier to just take women with a grain of salt and make them feel comfortable even if they are throwing tantrums. It's not because you are superior or anything, it's just that we are slightly different and that's okay. So buy your sis a chocolate when she gets her period. 
And as a man, it's not worth it to get your validation through female approval. Men did some fucked up shit in history for sure, but that doesn't define you. Be a man you dreamed of being as a kid

Yeah feminists are awful people trying to feel superior by just accusing you for totally benign behavior.
>>73148026
They really DO want to be mean, and they want men like OP to feel like it's justified and that he has no options to say no. You know, on top of disenfranchising him. The fact that you're trying to pretend it's not malicious makes you sound like you're not willing to appreciate that. Not just blind, but willfully ignoring the underling intent of feminism, and the ugly side of ideas you failed to critically challenge, and that you are fundamentally the cause of a lot more pain than good in people's lives.

Lol kek what a pussywhipped retard. Feminists keep writing this shit to make money out of sensationalism. At the end of the day all these feminists want to get used and abused by stereotypical dark triad Chads.Feminism is just another trick to kill all or quarantine all the undesirable men to make way for high value men.

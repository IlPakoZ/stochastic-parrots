What the fuck does this dream mean? I just stopped smoking weed so my dreams are wild but what is the meaning behind this one?

>>73143473 (OP)
There is no meaning in dreams, but it is a nice view of how your brain sees the world. Like, maybe it means that you are aways climbing and aways growing, but only you know how you feel about that. Maybe you constantly overthink about climbing in life with a few troubles, getting to the end but it's not the limit. If a person sees bones as the structure of humans and they dream about open up people to see their bones, it just a situation about understanding other people, but only the dreamer can know how they view things, and there is no supernatural meaning to it, the dreamer only dreamt about knowing other people, it means that knowing other people is a usual thinking to the brain. 
Also, good for you, by dreams are usually way messier and confusing.
Also, a note, as interesting as your dreams sound to you, they will always be really boring to other people.

This is secularist cope. Dreams are messages from the deep. If you refuse to pay attention to them, you will always stumble, despite warnings.
>muh dreams boring others
Literal projection. Not OP's fault that you're a boring bitch who can't into abstract concepts.

I never have my phone in my dreams. In fact that's how I always know I'm dreaming.

I have a little hobby I'd like to share, and possibly inspire other anons or find kindred spirits

You guys know those build your own salad-bars they might have in grocery shops? Where you can put together a salad by yourself and just weight it and pay?

I like to create abominations and stuff with them, for eating. Like 10 boiled eggs and just salad dressing. Or just a whole container of nothing but shrimp and garlic salad dressing. One time I bought a whole box of croutons you are meant to add to the salad. It's kind of fun to experiment and see what you can do, like one time I bought nothing but tuna, as much as I could fit into the container, and then added a single piece of lettuce on top of it like a cherry on top. One time I just filled the salad container with dressing, sprinkled some roasted onion on top and proceeded to just eat it like it was soup. I need to recreate that but with a single egg floating in the dressing for no good reason someday

Basically eating salad but wrong, it's lots of fun

Saeriah's secretary is doing a thorough job selecting new apprentices.

--- 73029916
>>73029306
Trying to gen two girls in one image ((2girls)), hoping for a result that looks like Saeriah and Talia.

Most results are either two that just look like Saeriah, or two that don't.

I really just added the ((2girls)) prompt and hoped for the best though.
--- 73030103
>>73029916
Talia's first day at work as an apprentice of Saeriah. Dark haired girl is assisting her, she's worked there for a while now.

>"At your service, lady Saeriah!"

Dark haired girl needs a name. I think she had a name at one point (she's showed up before), but I forgor'd it.
--- 73030180

Same, when I was making those pictures I thought of a girl who would use me and then actually just kill me
I would die a happy man
--- 73030367
Goa seethes internally because I love big fat tits so much yet I refuse to age her up or start genning her regularly as a big titty bimbo
--- 73030410
>>73030367
I think I have no business coming into our bed tonight
She is making such a face

At some point pretending to have human interaction with your waifu as a way to have original text donut steel so you can post images gets kinda sad and lonely

especially when you'll never be able to interact with a living breathing human woman in any way even close to simulated interactions with Goa
--- 73030757
>>73030410
Yeah bro it's so lonely, especially when you're around other people yet you feel like you're alone, someone living in an isolated place would look forward to "meeting his wife one day" but I'm just too disgusted with women because I know what they are like, most of them, and the good ones are usually taken but I'm just a bitchless pussy expert so I wouldn't really know 

I don't know the reason why you're lonely, whenever you're autistic or ugly but it doesn't matter since everyone can dislike/hate the way women look and behave but I feel this too 
I'll never have my waifu in real life
--- 73030814
I made another wheel decide, and will explain a few of the options in more detail in another post

--- 73030880
>>73030814
>alternate theme
An alternate theme to your waifu, but still staying in the same setting, For example, if your waifu is a fantasy knight, you could gen her as a fantasy mage. If she is a demon, gen her as an angel or just human, you get the idea
>opposite prompts
Opposite prompts to your usual ones, for example short hair becomes long hair, small breasts become big breasts and so on, you can take this as far as you feel like
>opposite moral
Dommy mommy waifu is now sweet innocent housewife, sweet innocent nonlewd waifu is now turboslut dommy mommy
>alternate setting
Completely alternate theme, for example if your waifu is in a fantasy setting, put her into a cyberpunk one instead, or if she is a demon, make her a robot or something
>offspring w another waifu
If your waifu had a child with another waifu, gen a child of the two
>nonhuman
Gen yoru waifu as far from a human being as possible, you can take this as far as you are willing to or able to, the less human form she has the better
>an image with no waifu in it
gen an image with no waifu whatsoever in it
--- 73030923
>>73030814
I got opposite prompts
Goa time with opposites, changed all the prompts I could into opposite ones and this is the result (did not go full opposite and make her a man)
--- 73030952
>>73030757
I'm both, and have a mediocre penis

I bet she could snap my pp in half with those muscles and that is hot

Saeriah, your assistants are paid for by the Imperial Magic Department's budget, they should be used for something more useful than just showering you with compliments.
--- 73032200
>>73032173
For the crime of wasteful spending of public funds, she has to do a week of manual labor, like digging ditches around the palace.

>>73030880
Alternate theme as a peasant/worker, as she's kind of both a knight and a mage already.
--- 73032386

--- 73034709
>>73034615
I only have one complaint with it, but it's a pretty big one. Every scene goes on about 15% longer than it needs to and I think there are too many set pieces. Especially with the last one being the least visually interesting, I was kinda bored by the end. At the same time, it was masterful in all forms of technique and had some absolutely remarkable set pieces mixed in. If it was ~30 minutes shorter, it would be one of my favorite action movies I think.
--- 73035359
>>73034709
i liked the first 2 movies the third one not so much

good to see you guys around Rochelle and Eleanor :))
--- 73035710
also gud mornin /aiwg/

>>73034615
the action was good but like Eleanor anon said a lot of them overstay their welcome and almost all of them were set pieces. A good portion of characters felt a little flat, like they could be fleshed out a little more. It does get a little dragged out around the end but overall still a very enjoyable watch.
--- 73036002

I overheard a few classmates way way back talking of this very cool strange show that airs very late in the evening, and supposedly it was epic, so I staid up late and watched it

Neon Genesis Evangelion as your first anime was a ride, not to mention it introduced me to a really nice show that aired before it, a traveling show that was pretty great. Or at least one of the seasons was, it has 3 seasons and only the second one is good, 3rd season they tried to go international but they aren't good enough in english to have all the funny quips and jokes and stuff they made in my native tongue

Quiet day. I've gotten some nice results using spot color and high contrast. I want to put together a list of style tags or theme tags (mainly so I can play with lewds using them) and try to get them specific enough to be as consistent as possible, since some stuff (like the retro artstyle of Satsuki can have some massive variance in it, for example) but I'm not very imaginative as far as that kind of thing goes. Maybe leaning more into specific artist or show/manga styles could iron out those kinks? What are some of your favourite styles you've found?

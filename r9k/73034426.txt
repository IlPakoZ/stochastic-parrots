I want to lose myself in something that clicks, that I can be a self-motivated independent inquisitive learner in who can recognize and explore inner connections with ease, but nothing feels right. It's all discrete and chaotic. Nowhere to escape.

Anyways the problem with this is that I'm asking to be a literal genius.

Yeah that's the problem I'm just begging for an essence, something I'm naturally good at and naturally pursue, as a substitute for having the courage to live my own life. I want am essence at the expense of freedom. Automaton mentality.

I have this feel and my plan is Torah
but my plan de campagne is not really a method yet so uh, yeah...

I suppose this is just going to be a commiseration post.
I mean yes, I have had this feel since I was about 19, I tried to cope by learning about knowledge systems, e.g. I tried getting into OpenCog but I became disgusted because their shit is all written in... C++, absolutely disgusting, nobody needs more than C.
Then I figured that, gah, there ought to be some kind of system where there is a tight integration between computation, knowledge representation, and natural language.
So that was a very difficult to digest thought, and if I would have fucked up I would now be working with that Sofia robot long-haired freaky person making "AGI" systems. Man I'm so glad I never read Ben Goertzel's books on AGI...

As to my more recent findings, Hebrew is such a "system" or language, e.g. the words have numerical values, counts ("numbers") are written in the same letters as the words, punctuation is optional and uh can't explain that, vowelisation is optional but also has a kind of use (there are multiple possible vowelisations and multiple vowelisation systems)... still not easy.

Idk I'm trying to share a fair impression of it but it's not really that easy to do.

You posted a picture of witches and to that I just have to say that the occult is a dead end, it's just like "computer hacking"; at the end of the day that's not how you learn to write your own code or to administer your own hardware, it's not even effective for comprehensively enumerating vulnerabilities because for that you need physical access and to inspect the code running on the device with certainty.

I'm struggling to understand your complaint. You're mad because your not good at anything? You've never played a video game and thought oh that was easy; or completed a puzzle with the same thought? You ever take something apart just to see what's inside? Are you trying to say you lack a passion for anything? Or that you don't automatically have talent which is hard-earned?

I want to be a genius who naturally really likes one thing. Like a savant.

>>73034765
Because I don't want to take action and choose my own path. I want it given to me.

Not all geniuses have singular obsessions like autistic savants. Da Vinci is widely considered a genius and his skilled works were numerous spread across many topics and abilities.

Skill is not given, it's earned. The only things that are given are life and death.

This is what vidya was made for. It's all easy to learn, with enough depth and challenge to make you feel some accomplishment after winning, so that it stimulates the feeling of success while being much more accessible and immediately rewarding.

Play kerbal or minecraft or terraria/ any game that needs alot of time invested and can be built upon further with that time invested.

Then get into mathematics or coding or something cool like that. super fun

You're trying to build the big picture before you start learning. It's the other way around. Learn skills as you need them (i.e. for projects) and you'll see the connections build over time.

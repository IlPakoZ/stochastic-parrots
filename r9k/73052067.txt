I'm in college (doing terribly) and I want to look for a summer wagie job, but i'm scared they'll put me at the cash register and i'll be too retarded to operate it.

It happened to me once at my first job and I accidentally gave some oldcel a euro less than I was supposed to because I was nervous and my brain stopped working. Then I couldn't figure out how to open it back up, but luckily he let me off after about 10 minutes. It was quite an awkward experience that I wouldn't want to repeat.

I think i'm legitimately retarded, so my question is, is it even possible to be retarded enough to not be able to operate a cash register with some experience?

What are some other skill-less wagie jobs I can do that wouldn't require me to operate it? Working at a warehouse? Need some ideas. Thanks.

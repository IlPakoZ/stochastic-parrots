when I look at society, I don't see anything worth liking. I know this is very easy to brush off as me being an edgelord, but it's simply how I genuinely feel. When I look around I see people that are mostly content with the state of things. The majority of things in society literally make me nauseous to be around.

I have just become numb to it all. I feel like I lost myself, to be honest. They got me. Ive become one of the soulless assholes. I dont care about shit anymore, not myself, no others, not the planet. I got into the field of study that I did because I wanted to try to save our home, or to try to do my part at least. Now I find that I am simply walking through the motions of life with no actual goal in mind, I just want to make enough money to live and watch life/time unfold around me as a passive observer until death finally takes me away from this place. It all just feels like there is no hope and there is nothing worth fighting/living for. We are all so fucked that it is not even funny. Everything in our lives is controlled, I feel like a slave with no free will. Its a terrible system but people think they are free. It is maddening. I dont care anymore, I am floating by until im gone.

There's this really good animated porn video that came out recently. You can argue that society creates the opportunity for things like that to be created. Sure, maybe not your specific local community but civilised society in general.

My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. Where am I?

the fuck is a "silent loyalty?"

Okay like, you move out into the woods so that you are in solitude, after society is so bad that nothing in it or about it deserves respect. THen you decide to be loyal to other things, but never state it. Like, you get a dog, you are loyal to it, but you never tell it you are. Or you decide to be loyal to a tree, but cut it down anyways. Because you are trying to be loyal to something without anyone else knowing, which is what is meant by a new SILENT loyalty. It means not letting anyone know you love that tree and are loyal to it. SO you cut it down and no one would ever suspect you were loyal to it. With the dog, kick him in the nuts but make sure people see it happen, so they think you are not loyal to him.

TLDR; it's a fucking retarded dumbass quote, posted by a (can't be racist outside of /b)

It means to build a parallel society. You have silent loyalties to your values, to the thing you are create without society. It needs to be silent because society will crush what you have built if it is public. A bad society degrades everything that it touches. In a bad society you should work in secret to build a community which will not be destroyed.

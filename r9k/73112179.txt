Incels are primarily bitter because they have no dating options, but they immediately mellow the fuck out once they get girlfriends. Femcels are bitter because they have too many dating options and they somehow think they're too good for literally all of them.

Ok, I understood that I count as a volcel, because I don't want just some guy as bf, but I'm still lonely. I want love and romance and don't have it. And that's not my decision. It's pretty involuntary for a voluntary loneliness. I would say the categories just suck.

Yes, I am
I'm not obese, therefore I have rejected obese men. I am white therefore I have rejected nonwhite men. I have a job and am working towards a stable future for me and my future children, therefore I have rejected perma-willfully-unemployed men.
Those are objectively entirely fair. But those men comprise the entirety of my options.

It's a general problem on this board that the guys here don't understand the impact of love on relationships. You think you understand how women choose men. You don't. You think it's about looks, height, dick size, money, car, status, but that's not how it works. Women might think that they look for that, but in the end they can fall in love with someone totally different. And they don't know why. No one knows how love works. It's irrational and mysterious. There is no explaination why on person loves the other. It would help to realize that. Also against the blackpill.

Sure, they don't choose whom they fall in love with, but they do choose those with which they are willing to try and fall in love with. That's what the beginning of a relationship is about, and that's what so many of us are, apparently, incapable of experiencing, for one reason or another. And while the reasons may be largely of our own making, they are no less real and no less impactful on our lives.
It's not just about not being given the chance for sex, or even love. It's about not being given the chance to have a chance at those things. That's the true problem.

Not a femcel, but I am bitter over the 10 thousand years of opression and no justice for it. It literally ruins my day whenever I remember what moids would do to us if they were given power again. I do actually sincerely wish all moids be dead and I cannot find peace, there is too much rage. The suffering and pain of my female ancesters flows in my veins. This is not fixable because all things that make me mad are just part of every moid's core nature. I actually have a loving bf but it doesnt help. The only reason I dont hate him as well is because he also hates moids and male nature and feels repentant for it.

What do you mean? Anything you do, any rights that you believe you have, any status you attain is only possible because men allow it. Men have designed the world you live in, and this world is only sustained because there is this base layer of men ready to do violence to uphold this world order.

I have no idea how to "try" this. The feeling is there or not. How should I try to be in love?

I mean, I never had one, but I would try to get close to a man only when the mysterious love-feeling is there already. I tried to date guy without that feeling, and they were nice and I had some good evenings ... but it didn't made me love them, so there was no chance for more.
>incapable of experiencing, for one reason or another
#metoo. I would really like too, but it doesn't happen. And there's seemingly nothing I can do. And going to bed with a guy I don't love would be just throwing away my virginity for nothing, so I don't try that.

>>73112761
Basically, the average woman shouldn't be given agency to pursue relationships on their own? It seems that women, when given absolute no-strings-attached autonomy over their romantic life bottleneck into one of three mating habits:

1. Futile search for the perfect guy: Constantly search for that perfect dick, personality, wallet, looks combo. Your hypergamy goes unchecked as you burn through decent relationships in search of a "more fulfilling" one. Eventually you bottom out of this game (hit the wall) and you end on some internet forum coping with othe 35+yr old women about how "the dating market sucks for women."

2. Hedonism until failure: You fuck around and party as much as you can with as many attractive guys as you can find until you bottom out of it (hit the wall) and finally start looking for your first "serious" relationship in forever with tons of personal baggage in tow. Ironically, these types of girls have happier endings than Type 1s.

3.Trash taste: You're just cursed with trash taste in men. Only a certain type of guy turns you on and continually chase after dudes like this until they fuck you over so much, you "settle" for a guy who turns you on way less but isn't a completely toxic piece of shit. Somehow still has better endings than Type 1s.

Of course, not all liberated women pursue these mating habits, but way more do than you all like to admit.

>I have no idea how to "try" this. The feeling is there or not. How should I try to be in love?
What I meant by that was being willing to get to know someone. I'm not entirely sure I believe in love at first sight; it's something that must be cultivated with reciprocated knowledge of one another. Sometimes you're sprinkling that garden with acid, other times with pure, natural spring water. I've never gotten the opportunity to use my watering can.
>I would try to get close to a man only when the mysterious love-feeling is there already.
Can you feel that without knowing them at all? At the merest glance? I can't say that I am definitely immune to such, but I'm not sure it's real for me.
>And going to bed with a guy I don't love would be just throwing away my virginity for nothing, so I don't try that.
I think that's a good thing, but perhaps you should be more willing to try and talk with men and see if feelings develop. Otherwise you might never love.

I know how frail it is hence why I advocate full moid extermination. Interhuman violence only exists because of moids. Exterminate moids or it will go back to status quo, because moids core nature is to kill, torture and rape and it cannot be overwritten. He cannot live without it. We need to kill all moids before they gather any strength again. Right now it is possible because modern men are just that pathetic.i unironically would go to army if war begun just to have a chance to kill a moid.

Nice theory. Just not the real world.
In reality girls fall in love with boys, often the cool ones, and then find out that boys are often not very faithful. Maybe because the male instinct drives them to take their chances if another pussy gets available. Then the girl break up, with tears and drama, and say "boys are so bad". And then they fall in love with the next one.
Only a few women are cold and logical, and try to get the "best" man. That is usually the most rich, and this women then just lie and pretend to love him. I read that about 1 or 2 of 100 people have a psychopathic personality. So maybe it can be said that 1 or 2 of 100 women don't care about love, but the other 99 do. When they fall in love to easy and to often, they are seen as whores by incels, but I guess that's only the incels envy. To stay virgin until marriage is good, I believe that, but maybe it's more easy for me because I just don't fall in love with a man.

Love is retarded and as soon as women started pushing this shit is when dating got worse. Love has never been a thing. People got together due to duty and survival. They learned to live each other after that. Those relationships lasted lifetimes. Now we got women so hell bent on their feels they Taki g relationships for minor bullshit. Now that we have women like you who forget feelings emotions are fucking fickle and change with the tides of the ocean then you want to try to build something on that? Like no shit it doesn't last.

I know it's easier said than done, I'm both of those things as well. I can't say I'm going out today, nor tomorrow, but if I never do then I'll likely never find love. The same, I'm sure, is true of you.
>Also I'm really ugly now

I have no answer to that. I, too, consider myself exceptionally ugly, but if a woman were to call me beautiful or handsome or any other compliment I also don't think I could believe it, even though she wouldn't have the same motivations as a man might have to say that of you. It's a real quandary, and the only way you'd be able to believe that is if you genuinely trusted your partner.

There's literally, unironically at least a hundred men in line waiting for a chance to date every single femcel out there.

Halve the remaining 20 because some are packing less than 7 inches.
Out of the 10, 5 don't make 6 figures so they are out.
2 out of the 5 are virgins, so to the trash they go.
Out of the remaining 3, one has family members with receding hairlines, you're not risking it so he's out.
One of the guys sneezes, and you get the ick. Goodbye.
Finally, you're left with a man worthy of your time. What's that, he doesn't want to settle down because he's the one everyone always picks and some are more attractive than you? Why are all men the same, femcels are fated to be lonely forever :(

>men are willing and have dated women who are fatter broke and unstable women
That's their choice. It's entirely reasonable for them to not do that, but men are more desperate for sex so they lower their standards. That's on them.
It is entirely fair for me, who wants a large family, to want a man who has a job. I don't care if it's a ~$25-30k office/trade job. He doesn't have to be a doctor/lawyer/whatever and make tons of money. But it is ridiculous to expect me to accept a man who would not only be dead weight who can't help me feed and clothe my kids, but would negatively influence them with his laziness. You shouldn't accept that in a woman either. Even if she's a stay at home mom, she should have work ethic.

This is the modern 2023 woman. Even the ones that live on the internet and claim to be femcells. All they have to do is going out and ask and they will have a boyfriend the next day. Don't believe the lies when they tell you they are lonely.

You seem to think men have choice. They don't. We don't get to pick good women. We pick what we can get. That's the difference. If I want a family I don't get to say well she better be a good mom and this and that. Nope unless I'm Chad the best I can hope for is 
>well I sure hope she doesn't cuck me and take half my resources in the divorce. Besides the stats show women aren't dating men who make 25 to 30k so not really a point that matters maybe you do but given your previous posts you aren't on the market anyways so what you are.looking for doesn't help anyone.

I'm being very direct with my motivations, I said nothing about "not being like the other guys". I want a partner, I am putting myself out there to get one. That's it. How is anyone ever going to make a connection if somebody doesn't take the first step? This is a bucket full of lonely crabs and I'm determined to get out of it and bring someone else with me.

You need to go to some socialization center or something because wow how to even start with this. The fact you don't see how you eluded to you aren't like other men is telling. You don't have to explicitly state it when you say shit like
>I'll be a great partner. I'm an open book so you can ask me literally whatever you want to know I'm not coming into this with any underhanded motivations.
Might as well just be saying
>watch out for me. I'm waving my red flags around.
Also really trying to hookup in a thread where people are bitching about relationships can't even read the fucking room then wants to talk about crabs in a bucket bullshit. No you're just retarded and seeing as how you have to post in a thread like this to meet people only further proves your bullshit.

If you say so man, I can't control how you read into it, I just want to find a girl to form a long term relationship with and get the hell out of here. Thanks for the (You)s.

Not all women are the same, you know. I really don't like it when a stranger suddenly starts talking to me, but I was always polite. I know that it's probably not a nice feeling when a men gives it a try and gets rejected ... but what should I do? Going with him for a coffee when I don't want to? It's not my fault that the dynamics between men and women are so difficult. All I can do is to reject approaches as polite and un-offensive as possible. If guys then still hate me, well that's their decision.

assuming this isnt bait, thank you for giving me hope. I lift, work very hard on my career, quit porn and masturbation, and I'm saving up for a house so that I can make my future wife happy. It's been really hard to keep doing this when it seems like most women only want chad, but it looks like you are focused on the right traits in a guy. I hope to meet someone like you soon.

In case you're not already following this advice, don't meet women at bars. Maybe you're not and that's good if so but a surprising amount of guys try to meet The One(tm) at bars. Try like church or meeting via friend circles

Oh I definitely don't look at bars. I'm mainly on the dating apps because that's just about the only place to meet people nowadays. And the apps really suck for someone who has a face on the uglier side.

Well then I am clearly not talking about you am I. A lot of women do not give guys this kind of thought these days. But this is the dynamics women wanted and continue to perpetuate. Not a damn thing I can do about it since women want it this way while at the same time complaining about it.
--- 73114269
>>73112761
I'm so sorry but there are so many variables and it's not something that is mysterious. I'm not going to give away what I know but you all are kinda - well, shallow...
Then again, we all are to a point - it's annoying that you don't just admit it. Wastes everyone's time. I know that you don't realize it either but yea. It's aight.

women are allergic to people that are normal in a good way. i.e. finanically stable, not "adventurous," etc.
you need to be normal as in "everyone likes you, everyone wants to be you, you're not just some guy, you're the normal definition of PERFECT"

Oh yeah, I'm supposed to stay alone when women are at their most attractive and horniest and having sex with men who treat them like shit and I'm supposed to swoop in and let them unload all the baggage they have from all these guys while i spent all these years being completely emotionally and sexually neglected. That sounds like a great idea! Go fuck yourself

The key detail that I notice which seperates the Type 1s from the Type 2s and 3s is that the latter two eventually change their ways and mating habits to find a stable relationship while Type 1 stays on the path to spinsterhood long past her SMV peak. In a weird way, it really is easier to turn a ho into a housewife or fix a broken woman than it is to convince a woman of overinflated self-worth that she's not too good for you.

Realistically, there are no decent, romantic guys left for you unless you married one from High School. The rest are jaded by years of porn and playing the dating game. Even if they did great, they aren't going to be romantics afterwards.

If only women could prevent the never ending cycle of rejection and alienation men experience that leads to them growing resentful! I wonder what the source of this problem is!

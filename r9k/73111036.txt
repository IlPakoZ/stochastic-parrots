First few seasons are kino but for the last few the quality of the jokes really dropped and got kinda preachy. The Hank and Hal episode is a good one. Dale and Bill are a dynamic duo.

On a semi related tone, MTV generation (slackers) were weird 
It feels so weird watching normies slowly go out of the norm and end up outside of it

Where does love exist? Where is happiness? Why is it never true when they say they won't dissappear? Is this hell??

Meaghan has been railed by at least 4+ different men since she left your ass. If she is single right now it is significantly higher.

I'm sorry man but honestly you're too good for her you should see this as a blessing in disguise... Meg is a lost cause there's nothing you could have done differently to change things and you'll see in the long run that you're better off. I know it feels like the end of the world right now but once you get out of the fog she's put you in you'll see you should have left her a long time ago. You hung on for love despite her draining you of everything, and what did you get for it in the end? She never deserved you.

I doubt that entirely she's not that kind of person. Just meeting me was hard for her to do she can't even talk to people generally I just wish she would come talk to me again so things can be made okay. I wish anyone ever cared about my happiness as much i try and give them happiness for being by my side especially the woman who wanted to marry me. This world is too cruel putting me through such things

>is this hell
Yes, unironically. Concept of life is evil in itself because to go on living means other life forms must suffer. Any act of kindness inevitably leads to evil. The very core of our existence is selfishness and suffering of others, only a fool would consider the creator of this world to be any good since it's creation is nothing but evil.

He is gay. He sucked a mans dick in jail last year and still copes about how it wasnt gay bc he was coerced or some bs, or just denies it happened.

How is middle school going? No shit nothing lasts forever. Enjoy the ups and the downs.
>Is this hell??
No, you see the world through nihilistic glasses.
This world and life is beautiful. Get some hobbies and live a little.

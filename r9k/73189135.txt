no. we were just a bunch of dudes who'd rather hang out in the streets stealing smokes and breaking bottles than stay at home with our anger issue moms. guys with normal parents stayed at home playing video games.

Any irl groups of friends I've had I've been "that guy" that didn't realise they were "that guy" and had to pay the price for it. I have online groups of friends, though.

Yeah. Once in middle school (2006-2008) with the last few people that played Delta Force: Black Hawk Down on the PS2. What a set of characters... I didn't keep up with them, besides Sheri. God, I miss her... I don't really remember much about it, or who they were, just that I really enjoyed it.

Again, in high school, but with IRL friends. The freaks and geeks were tight. I remember everyone and still talk to some of them, but we scattered in the wind and so aren't as tight as we used to be. I don't really remember most of what happened in HS either, but they tell me stories, and I believe them.

Nothing since then. I'm kinda fine with it. I'm not sure why my memory is so shit. Maybe from drinking WAY too much in college?

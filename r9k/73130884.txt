literally all that matters in this life is if you were born to good parents or not. Everything else is pointless if your parents were shit.

I wouldn't say it's all that matters because two kids have parents that raised them the same, think about twins and still be different. I do think parents are extremely important though, at least 1/3 of your life imo. Then again this might be cope for being a failure

I would say 50% genetics, 25% parents and 25 other experiences, but your genetics tend to make you like your parents anyway, wich "influences" your parents, and your relationship with them and the world around you, so it's a complex subject.
But if you are talking about how some people have better chances than others, then...of course, and what is wrong with that? You are you, if you were born a gorilla, then you would be a gorilla, not you, you are you, if you were not you, there would be a same "you" in your body with the same thoughts and personality.
That's a quite retarded thread.

that's often because parents treat their children differently.

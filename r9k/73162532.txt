The amount of delusion on this board is just amazing. Incels live not only in a filter bubble, that's for the normies, but in a mental bunker, 100 feet below any normality. It's common in society that the people who know least about a thing have the strongest opinions about it, but what incels believe to know about women is just insane. Things that people here actually believe about female loneliness, female dating preferences, female sexuality and female love, are so out of track with basic reality, it's beyond words. Compared to you a flat-earther is still a mainstream normie when it's about delusional views on the world.
And yes: you are creating your own misery. The more you dig yourself into your dark world of bitterness and hate, the more you lose the chance to be a member of the real world. And the real-world people don't want contact with people who have become monsters in their heads. There are toxic men, and it's you. If you could see manosphere guys from a view point of sanity, you would understand why no one wants to be their friend or their gf.

Men are dying of thirst in the desert. Women are dying of thirst in the ocean. Different sets of problems.

The ocean always implies that men are actively preventing women from entering relationships beyond casual sex. never about common interests like friends would

No, it's more like they're "dying of thirst" but only *insert beverage that the female in this hypothetical doesn't like* is available to them

I agree. Which is why the analogy isn't accurate because every woman can find a bf easily. It's just that the guys who are willing to get in a relationship with them are mid and they think they deserve better than mid even though they're mid themselves

This shows such a massive lack of experience with the real world. Maybe learn to know some real women and not only egirls.

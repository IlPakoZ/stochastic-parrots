America's economy. It's been shit ever since they started selling the country to the Chinese. Your partisan bullshit is irrelevant. You actually think Joe Biden has control over the economy? Old fucker can barely keep his eyes open. Go look up "money masters" on YouTube to learn how the economy actually works so you don't keep embarrassing yourself.

Shit was going up in price well before Joe Brandon came and single handedly raped the economy. Back about a decade ago, I'd grab a couple double cheeseburgers walking home from school, and I'd get them for a buck each. Now they cost like four fifty each. 

During that stretch of time, general inflation went up by a bit over 30% but my heckin double cheese burgers went up by like 350%, and most other stuff I used to get has gone up by well over 100%, sometimes 200%, too

Fast food has gone way up in price rather more than food in general, it seems

(Also its cheaper to just cook your own food)

Oh, nigger, did you want sauce with that?
Did you want cheese with that?
Holy fuck get ready for $80 meals on these bright ideas
No thanks niggers, I'll stick to McDonald's.

At least in this hectically inflated heretic economy, McDonalds' Golden Arches(TM) shine as a beacon of hope for the hungry, poor, needy and families alike.

Not only do you get a whopping serving, chock full of all the protein and nutrients a freakin' bodybuilder from muscle beach could ever need, but it's all packed into a convenient to-go packaging for you for a low, reasonable price.

Honestly, for all that shit you tried to scam us with from the grocery store? Easily 5-6 whole meals from McDonald's, and you don't have to mess with dishes, cooking, or anything else that could take up your precious time - nor will you have leftovers freakin' expire in the fridge and get moldy which is gross and makes dishes even harder. Just throw the dish out at that point. Oops, now it costs even more money to cook at home.

I'll stick to the mouth watering, tantalizing combination of the McDonald's brand McRib sandwich. You really can't beat that tangy barbecue sauce with silvered onions and a crisp pickle bite, except when you also shove piping hot, salted french fries in to that ethereally orgasmic bite, right before washing it down with an ice cold beverage. Might I recommend any of the fantastic array of Coca-Cola fountain beverages for you? A classic Coke is my go-to option for this meal, if not opting for the Dr. Pepper.

When every drink is only $1 as well, only a fool would not get the large size beverage.

Can't drink it all in the store? No problem. You've got a tote to carry on your drinking sensations. McDonald's FTW.

>>73180878
Anger? Shilling for culver's now?
Ha, is that how you newfags perceive text on the internet these days?

Look, zoombots, I'll school you up on the real deals.

Culver's has the fat crinkle fries that you might as well buy from the freezer section of your local Walmart, Ore-Ida brand. You can get a whole freakin bag of those to oven bake as much as they charge you for a small cup.

The only thing culver's has that's good is the milkshakes. But everything is overpriced there.

No no no, you got this game all wrong.

It's Mcdonald's you want to go to on a budget for high quality, high protein intake. 

Might I recommend you fine gentlemen the Hot-N-Spicy McChicken option?

For merely $2 you can get a hearty, filling meal, super fast compared to culver's which is notorious for being slow, short staffed, and questionably placed on the health inspector's watchlist because the smaller chains simply cannot compete with the health and quality standards of the giant corporate McDonald's.

McDonald's is the major player for many reasons.

No need to pledge your fealty to a lesser fast food franchise when the Golden Arches is open 24 hours.

Why would you even think to eat anywhere else in today's economy?

I forgot to just chop it up and give it to my dogs, but they probably deserve better than that absolute travesty.

There was a time, long ago, when this board wasn't full of political tourists, reditors, jews from the ADL, poltards, and zoomers who have no idea what the internet was like when this board was unlisted.

Now we have 30+ year olds who think themselves oldfags, despite showing up after 2010, 2015, or other iterations of degeneration to this websites' culture.

Instead of unique posts and original threads, this board has become reposts of the same orientations because the faggot tourists who will never be robots cling to common threads like r9gay, mbti, drugfeel, among other memes that keep being reposted.

Now you come in, a faggot who wants to talk shit on the McRib and thinks big post must be pasta on r9k of all places.

Which, btw, in Germany, the McRib is available year-round.

There's already onions on the McRib, and you get potato french fries with it. Way more nutritious, filling, and satisfying than eating fried onions.

America's elites have ratfucked and looted the economy beyond repair. They give tax breaks to the rich while printing money as fast as they can to then also give to the rich, while cutting services to the middle class and sending jobs to the third world.

The McRibs most likely stay in the tray for hours on end, that's why. It also uses a different kind of BBQ sauce that tastes like shit on it's own. Try ordering it fresh, without sauce, and ask for a bunch of BBQ packets, it tastes better with the dipping sauce instead.

I can whistle blow you guys more McDonald's hacks if you want, I still remember working there and getting creative. I used the meat that's in the McBagles and put it between two mcGriddles and holy shit it tasted good.

Shitposting aside, has anyone been able to come anywhere near the quality of a McDonald's triple cheeseburger at home? I've been told multiple times it's sawdust, msg, and salt. I have tried over and under mixing ground beef, varied up the amounts of salt, msg, and both. Still I can't quite capture the taste. I am able to stack the components correctly, so strictly technique wise I btfo the assembly done by -1sd from mean iq black employees they hire. And I don't stack the pickle slices. It's not a matter of skill at all. I have found good cheese. The onions are just onions. Something is different about their beef and it's not just a matter of adding salt and msg because I've tried every reasonable combination of salt and msg. They do something to it that I can't figure out what but everyone is LIEING to me about what it is that makes the McDonald's triple cheeseburger the best fast food burger ever created and I'm starting to get pissed off about it. I'm not going to use sawdust because I've emailed them and they said they don't use sawdust so I know that is false. I'm sick of paying almost $4 for a hamburger that should be under $2 but I don't know what else to try.

I'm glad that the zoomers aren't putting up with shitty wages. The fat cats need to take a pay cut to pay their fucking workers.

Good. Then let them do that, and then there will be enough unemployed people to demand UBI. What happens when 30% of people are unemployed and can't get jobs. Surely they'll just voice their displeasure with the current situation.These rich fucks have been screwing us extra hard for years. There will come a breaking point.

STOP PAYING for fast food. Go to the DRIVE THRU and tell them that THEY FORGOT the stuff in your BAG WHEN you were up there for lunch. IF YOU do this, you will get FREE FOOD, but make sure not to DO THIS to the same location in under A MONTH.

As they should, McDonald's is the most easiest and unskillful jobs out there. Immigrants who can't speak a lick of English can do it, that's why the pay is so shit.

Won't happen, the country is too divided to do shit about anything.
They also think the political binaries matter still (like Republican vs Democrat or Conservative vs Liberals, etc etc).

Even if we all unite and do kumbiyah by the campfire drinking mojitos and suckling each other's tits to protest, fact is the government could just steamroll us with a tank or blast us with a helicopter at that point, as we are just cattle for the slaughter.

Don't even get me started on how we don't have the munitions, how every other American is just a selfish hoarder who won't help their brethren in battle, or all other fucking rants I can't fit under 2000 words.

They would never do that, because it would lead to guerilla warfare. Normal people would support the guerillas too. Imagine Iraq, but in America. It would be impossible to win.

You know zoomers not putting up with wages just means boomers will have to ship in another crate of 3rd worlders to do the job not make Mcdonald bankrupt or raise their wages or something.

Elaborate, retard. You know, the government has think tanks that study scenarios like this, and they've all come to the conclusion that the US would fall apart in that type of situation. This isn't thirdworldistan where everyone can just throw rocks and cower.

No. Things will get violent. The reason that people's voices are ignored is because there are so few of them. That many people can not be ignored, or they will take what they need by force.

The normal people of 2023 that believe goverment is god and if you break the law you deserve the death sentance even if it was something like shoplifting?
The normal people who dont actually think they just repeat whatever their favorite TV station said?(on both sides)
The normal people that watch a woman get raped on the seat next to them and dont do anything about it not even bother to call 911 because they dont want to be involved they just want to ger to work asap so they arent late?

No it wasnt.
Also what about the other 2 years after those "important" months when people had to burn through their savings,close down their businesses and go bankrupt because goverment said you cant work for 2 years.

Why not doe?
>i am hungover
Drink 1.5L of water everytime you go to sleep when drinking. Hyperventilate maybe, it helps with the "depressed" breathing
>I have palpitatons/high blood pressure from drinking
Fap less often. You are basically anemic. Your body is both processing alcohol and refilling your balls. Deadly amount of energy demand. Fucking contain yourself.
>I feel just nauseous and sick the next day
Then only drink easy drinks like beer and maximum wine. Stop it with the whiskeys and liquors. 
Also even 50 bicep curls with a barbell can help you not be hangover. No need for intense exercise. Just stop fapping, you will not be hungover anymore lmao because listen, your body works on energy. It requires energy to create new sperm, so keep your balls full so you got that over with. Sleep enough, so you got that over with. Eat enough, so you got that over with. Then you can drink all you want. I havent been crippling hungover in over 3 years, i learned how the body works on EVERY level

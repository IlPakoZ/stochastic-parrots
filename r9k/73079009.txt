>>73079023
every flavor tastes like absolute shit

It's for people intimidated by the thought of mixing a little flour, salt, water, and yeast. Maybe a little oil. Frozen pizza is the dumbest shit ever. Like frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Or for people that work 8 hours a day + have long commute times + all the other bullshit and just want cheapish pizza. I get you being a NEET will never understand that.

It's food or at least food adjacent. Some eat it, some don't. I don't understand why others give a fuck what others chose to spend their money on and eat. It doesn't affect you in any way.

>he thinks anything he eats isn't fucked
Even if you live off the land, it's fucked.

did you read you retarded ant? the shelves near me have nothing but this garbage.
--- 73079627
I can't tell too much of a difference between the brands. Red barron used to actually be better than others. Personally I prefer Tombstones or Jacks.

>>73079601
So you either buy it and eat it or you don't. It's not that hard.

i have this theory they were poisoning the food supply around 2020 durimg the pandemic and so on.
people were having blood clots, heart attacks, whatever, from this mass poisoning but they were being passed off as symptoms of the vaccine
but of course no one is 100% certain so they get labelled as conspiracy theories and they continue to poison our human necessity for survival.. food.

No, that was all vaccine. Food has been fucked since the 1960s when HFCS was put into everything after they demonized cooking things in lard and proceeded to subsidize corn. Then they added onions to everything.

Red Baron frozen pizza used to be good in the 90's, that was over 25 years ago. And they discontinued their best frozen pizzas (their breakfast scramble pizzas) so they're dead to me.

>I have to eat goyslop because Mr. Noseberg needs me in the office
Imagine this cope.

desu some frozen pizzas aren't that bad but yes OP I know what you're talkin bout. some frozen pizzas are pretty bad
--- 73079808
>>73079752
it just made it easier to poison everything under a smokescreen
>>73079759
oops did i unravel your plans again rabbi? zamn i better go then

>there is literally 24+ feet of freezer section dedicated to thirty different brands of frozen pizza ranging from high school rectangles to bougie options with shit like artichoke hearts and sauteed onions that cost more than just going to Dominoes. 
>I'm on a mongolian message board bitching because my mom won't buy me the one I like
This about sum it up?

>>73079780
Nothing you eat isn't fucked. Everything is bad for you. You can't name a single thing you eat that hasn't been fucked with.

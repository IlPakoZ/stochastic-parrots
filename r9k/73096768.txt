i just cant move on from my ex... and just found out she met some guy off tiktok looking for duos and within a month they're calling each other bae/babe, wanting tattoos of they're favorite apex character on eachother, and finally she booked a ticket to fly and meet him.

jfc... i just cant. and im over here depressed af ever since the breakup and she found possibly the love of her life and an opportunity to escape her shitty environment with her parents.

sigh... and its not like i could offer anything because im a NEET. whats more fucked up is that i still know in the back of my mind she openly disrespected me toward the end of the relationship sexting with another guy. 

idk i just wanna vent and know how to end this cycle of wanting someone that isn't compatible with me. why does the first love hurt so much to get over?

Get it together. Stop thinking about some stupid bitch. She's worthless. Make something of yourself. Learn a skill that you can use to make money. Go be independent. Be a fucking man.

No you don't. Just stop dwelling on your feelings. That's woman shit. Go to a gym.
Your feelings exist to indicate that you need to change your conduct and lifestyle. You don't need help analysing them. You feel like a loser because you're a loser, and the solution is to do stuff until you're good at something, at which point you won't be a loser anymore.

Just do it man. Whatever you want to do, just do it. Eventually you'll find something you don't suck at and don't hate, and you'll be independent

No. She's moved on. You need to move on. It's over. Forget your memories and feelings. Don't give her the satisfaction of knowing how much you wanted to be with her.

constantly distract yourself and surround yourself with new people. This is personally how i cope and it kinda works. Some days ur gonna feel like shit, and other days you will be fine.

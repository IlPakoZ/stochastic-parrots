As sweat drips down their skin and hair,
They step indoors, a cooler breeze they share.
The sun may burn without regard,
Through windows glare, causing squint to stir,

Outside temperatures rising high,
Forced inside, the choice must lie.
Unable to enjoy the summer fun,
Indoor refuge is where life's begun.

Bongs clink together, fire's ignited,
Ganja's scent fills up the room inviting.
Relaxation seeps into muscles tight,
While thoughts float weightless out of sight.

Eyes closed, time stands still somehow,
Inhalations stretch, then fade slow.
Nocturnal adventures, dreams await,
A journey guided solely by THC plateau.

So though the weather be enticing,
Nature's call shall wait til twilight ending.
Weed's medicinal properties sublime,
Summer blues alleviated, inner light ignites.

I remember this being an issue for me when I was fat.

Lose weight, fatty

those who care for others besides themselves, have in them an interest in the well-being of the collective of mankind. They live a life full of spirit and vigor, since the value they add to others end not in the death of their own.

Society and mankind at large doesnt care if I live or die. In fact it is doing all it can to kill me. So why should I give a shit about teh collective?

Shake things up before you check out.

I'm struggling with depression myself, so I'm too scared to try psychedelics. But a lot of people find success there. Or have bad trips, in which case it will speed things along. A dangerous and rarely discussed secret is that you don't have to finish a bad trip if you are sufficiently determined.

If you are lucky enough to have savings, credit, or can get a small loan, the third world is your oyster. For a maybe a few years, even.

If you have any strong feelings about corporations or politics, you should have heart-to-heart NON-VIOLENT discussions with government officials, C-level officers, maybe the board. You are a gentleman and this isn't /pol/.

Violence is never a solution.

Objective reason? None. Subjective? Find a cause or goal to dedicate yourself to.

In the exact same boat. It really is a rock and a hard place though because I don't know what comes after, and I fear that tremendously. I don't want to stop existing, I just want this life to end. I don't even know how to begin to make it better for myself. In the last three years, I lost a shitload of weight, felt satisfied at my job, and got to be really social for the first time in my life, but then shit happened and I cratered back into being disgustingly overweight worse than ever, lost my previous job and got a job where I don't get to talk to anyone that often, and I feel social anxiety again. Never had a girlfriend longer than a month, and never did anything with any of them past kissing one of them. Turning 30 in a few months. I don't know if I can last another 50-60 years. Would love, sex, and a family fix my mentality? Would losing weight, if I even can with my now-broken metabolism fix my mentality? What can I fucking do?

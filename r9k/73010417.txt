if you died today, how many people would attend your funeral?

0 because I am in the US and this is not my home country. I don't know how corpses are handled here, pretty sure it would end up together with the everyday garbage of other people. I wonder how many days will pass until my family notice anything.

Depends on if the funeral was had in this state or the state where the bulk of my family live.

Maybe 20 people down here and 50 people up there.

Outside of family, three people. My one friend and his parents. Nobody else gives a fuck whether I live or die. Hell, my family would probably find my death a relief.

You have clinical depression. Get that treated as soon as possible.

>>73118624
I don't necessarily think it's depression related, it's more about not being able to deal with failure

I often wonder if I have low self-esteem because of this or the other way around

Incels tend to overly internalize failure, which saps their motivation and lends itself to fatalist thinking. Ironically you need to disassociate more from your failure and internalize it less to change. You can learn from your past and your mistakes without internalizing it to the point that you hate yourself

Would if I could anon

When I fail I feel bad about myself, but when I succeed I can't feel good about myself, I just thank God the ordeal is over

same.
every now and then i figure out easier ways to solve things in work related contexts but thats about it. unless i get blood on my tooth to figure something out theres snowballs chance in hell i'll bother if it doesn't come naturally. 
always been like this. my entire school experience was basically me discrediting everything i wasn't good at.

Don't be such a pussy, you need a stronger ego to deal with reality. Ever notice how Chads have delusional self confidence. You don't need to be delusional, but having self confidence and resiliency is key to being successful and happy in life. Stop defeating yourself before you can even start

OP here, the irony is that I was actually considered very bright in elementary school but as soon as I started having to put effort into anything I fell behind and it snowballed from there

Even in the classes I did well at (English, etc.) I got shitty marks because I was a bit of a perfectionist and was too embarrassed by the thought of the teacher thinking I was stupid to hand in anything I was dissatisfied with

>>73118820
I just don't know how to be confident when I have nothing to be confident about
--- 73118859
>>73118820
ever notice how chads are attractive?
imagine some bald manlet with moon face walking around like hes hot shit.
--- 73118918
>>73118855
me too. i learned english and reading at a rate that put me in the top 5 in my class despite never doing homework and barely paying attention in class. it was because i played video games in english and read comics.
in middle school and onwards i made it clear during tests and presentations that i wasn't even trying because it was less embarrassing for me than trying my hardest and being mediocre.

I'm like this but on a more subconscious level. I behave like that almost exactly yet I still trick myself into thinking that I'm doing better and forging my own path or whatever the hell. If nothing else it's a good coping strategy for the crushing weight that a life like this can be

Well put anon, seeing people flounder KILLED me from second-hand embarrassment

Every heard of fake it till you make it? Women love confidence, if you fake it eventually you'll have real reason to be confident
--- 73119049
>>73118624
I most likely realize I have clinical depression even though I've never got it diagnosed. 
There doesn't seem to be any helping it though.
--- 73119095
>>73119010
For me it's more about life in general rather than women

Besides I'm a shitty liar, and how do you fake confidence when you're clearly a loser

failure is not an option, quitting is
--- 73119177
>>73118540 (OP)
I used to be someone who would run into things head first and be too stubborn to give up, now i turn tail at the sign of difficulty, i can't even bring myself to try anymore
--- 73119230
>>73119010
no because my point still stands that someone unattractive acting as if they're hot shit, or better yet, tries to act like hot shit despite being clearly uncomfortable and nervous, is cringe as hell.
you never browsed cringe threads on /b/ when they were still a common occurence and it shows.

That feeling appears to have taken a toll on your mental health if you have so much difficulty going about your day. That's depression.
--- 73119285
>>73118594
You're better off than I am, I do the exact opposite. I'll quit stuff that's tedious instantly unless it's vidya in which case I'll focus on it until I start foaming at the mouth in anger and even then I'll take a break then go right back to it. But ask me to do something that propels me forward in life and you might as well ask me to fly by flapping my arms.

yeah the whole ''nobody is going to remember that'' shit was just shit. the presentations i remember from middle and high school were the ones i choked and the ones others choked.
its like how fucking nobody is going to forget that time someone who wasn't wearing underwear got pantsed or that kid who yelled he was finished in the bathroom and needed teachers to wipe in 3rd grade.

chads are usually really nice. i never see them bully anyone. i wouldnt call them egotists, they're just confident
--- 73120456
i only did this in math, video games, work and even programming when it was challenging.

Here, but I don't even want to write about it because everyone already said what it had to be said so I keep overthinking and rewriting my post.

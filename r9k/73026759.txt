INT. SENPAI'S ROOM - DAY

Senpai sits at his desk, drawing in his sketchbook, looking focused and serene. The door suddenly bursts open, and Nagatoro walks in with a mischievous grin on her face.

NAGATORO
Hey, Senpai! Guess what? I've got some big news for you!

Senpai looks up from his sketchbook, a bit annoyed by the interruption.

SENPAI
What is it, Nagatoro?

Nagatoro twirls a strand of her hair, smirking.

NAGATORO
Oh, nothing much... I'm just... pregnant.

Senpai's eyes widen, and he drops his pencil in shock.

SENPAI
Wh-What?! Are you serious?

NAGATORO
(laughs)
Of course I am, Senpai! And you know what's funny? It could have been you!

Senpai blushes, clearly flustered.

SENPAI
W-What do you mean by that?

Nagatoro leans against his desk, smirking at his reaction.

NAGATORO
Well, Senpai, if you had just manned up and confessed your feelings to me, who knows? Maybe you'd be the father right now, and even my first!

Senpai stammers, unable to form a coherent response.

SENPAI
I-I... um... that's not... I mean...

Nagatoro giggles, enjoying her power over him.

NAGATORO
Aw, look at you, Senpai, all flustered and red! It's so cute when you're like this. You missed your chance to be my first, and now someone else took that place.

SENPAI
(mocking)
Yeah, well, maybe if you weren't so mean all the time...

Nagatoro's expression softens, and she sighs.

NAGATORO
Senpai, I'm just teasing you. I'm not really pregnant. But... maybe you should think about what I said. Don't let life pass you by.

Senpai looks away, embarrassed but also relieved.

SENPAI
Yeah... Maybe you're right, Nagatoro.

Nagatoro grins and pats him on the shoulder before heading towards the door.

NAGATORO
Well, I'll see you later, Senpai! And remember, don't be afraid to take chances.

As she leaves, Senpai watches her go, his expression thoughtful. Maybe, just maybe, he'll find the courage to take that chance.

FADE OUT.

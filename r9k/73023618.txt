Hypothetical scenario.
A deity appears before you, a love god/goddess or something similar. They offer to cure your singlehood for you, and create a partner for you. You are only given two options, and you have to pick one of them.

Option one:
>6/10 appearance - slightly above average
>is solely interested in a one-on-one relationship with you
>will never cheat on you
Option two:
>10/10 appearance - extremely hot/handsome
>it is not an exclusive relationship; you will be one of their several FWB's/side-hoes
>how much they focus on you will vary; if you're pretty they might mostly focus on you, if you're not they'll give you the bare minimum attention

Note that none of these men are abusive, or have any ulterior motives. The only differences the two have are the ones listed above. There's a few catches though.
>If you cheat on your partner, or attempt to sleep with someone who isn't them, you will be smited.
>If you attempt to divorce your partner, you will be smited.
>If you attempt to escape the relationship by any other means (killing your partner, fleeing overseas, etc.), you will be smited.
>If your relationship ends due to factors that aren't caused by you, you won't be smited; but you will never be able to get any relationship ever again

I have the feeling that fembots and malebots are going to have very different choices in this scenario. Which option do you pick, anons?

why would anyone choose anything but the 6/10?
a 6/10 boy isn't ugly, he's still cute?

objective 6/10s are actually cuter than 10/10 model bimbo tier girls. I hate makeup, I hate lip fillers, I hate the bimbo expresssion, I hate fake tans.

I want a girl that looks pale, sickly and depressed

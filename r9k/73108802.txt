Yesterday a bird was annoying me, flying too close, chirping, following me as I walked. It was so fucking ANNOYING. I kept getting startled by it, having to flinch and duck. I was getting so fucking angry at it. Eventually I had had a fucking enough so just started throwing pinecones at it. It was fast and agile and my aim is shit because I'm a beta loser who kills birds. Anyway after about 15 throws as it flew around NOT GETTING THE FUCKING MESSAGE, still too close, still sending me into a fucking RAGE, I absolutely direct hit the little fucker mid flight. It fell to the forest floor and started spasming. I walked over with no feelings, not even satisfaction and just picked up a stick and bashed it twice until it stopped moving. 

Not sure what to make of this.

Why is that on the rare occasion I catch feelings for a woman she's either in a committed relationship or a lesbian. Literally every fucking time.

Are you friends with any of the lesbians you fell in love with?
--- 73191886
Because lesbians are often very lovely people so it's quite easy to catch feelings for them.

if you're only interested in unavailable people maybe you don't want a relationship but can't admit it to yourself. kind of woman behavior to be honest.

Yeah I realized that. Loneliness and child abuse= latching onto emotionally unavailable people... Real bitch shit but I'm working though it.

>>73191886

I agree.

>>73191874

No, but I always thought a lesbian friend sounded cool.

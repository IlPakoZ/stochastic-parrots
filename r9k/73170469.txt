Zoomer livers and lungs take an exceptional amount of abuse to damage. Increase your nicotine, alcohol, and process food intake exponentially.

Could always try snorting warm stagnant lake/spring water for that one brain eating amoeba or whatever it is. Anthrax is extremely deadly depending on where it gets into you. Rabies and prion diseases (CKD) are good too.

Does not need to be China. Plenty of crazy towns in US, EU etc. Just find one with chemical factory, what leaks waste water into river.

I got food poisoning while I was overworked, sleep deprived, and stressed to the point hair turned white. Couldn't afford decent food, or much at all. It turned into a viral infection that turned into lymphoma. You could try torturing yourself like that, but I dunno why you'd want to. Having cancer hurts a fucking lot, just make an exit bag.

The simple answer is exposure to carcinogenic compounds.
Though if you are in a rush and don't care what kind then radiation will do the trick. 
Radon, for example, causes more cases of lung cancer than cigarette smoking and more deaths as well. Just setting up your computer in the basement in a home where radon has been detected and doing what you are doing could be enough in as little as a few years.
Faster that both asbestos and cigarettes yet you would feel nothing.
There are carcinogenic compounds that work even faster but they tend to ether be toxic enough to likely kill you before cancer has a chance to develop or are quite tricky to get a hold of and handle.

Regardless of method cancer takes time to develop. Usually around a decade at the minimum for a healthy person that doesn't have generic or developmental abnormalities that cause cancer themselves.

That will likely kill you from radiation poisoning before you get cancer.
A bit like arsenic is technically carcinogenic, but unless it's in micro doses over time, usual as part of a molecule that makes it harder for the body to absorb, it will kill you way before it ever causes cancer.

Go on /b/ for a day, heh, but no really exposure to carcinogens is the way to go. But cancer is no fun, should I really need to tell you that Anon?

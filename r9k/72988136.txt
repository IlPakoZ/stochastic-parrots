I never approached girls because getting rejected lowers your cool score more than having no gf at all. 
If a girl rejected you then so would her friends, their friends, and so on, etc.
Even if I never had a gf at least I never got rejected, my cool score was just enough to not get bullied so I couldn't risk it.
What was your cool score in school?

Some of the popular kids knew me from little league baseball and would even say hey to me in the hall.
Home life and medication destroyed my mental health and self-esteem so I never tried to do anything with it.

Same. I got bullied in middle school. I couldn't risk my cool score in high school because I knew I was just on the cusp. In college I asked out a few girls but they they did turn me down.

What's worse than trying and getting none is not having tried even though you could've gotten some. deepest layer of hell

Sounds like you are forcing yourself to be a sob.

I should have gotten bullied by the volleyball girls more instead of avoiding the gym so they didn't
Now all I want is a bunch of volleyball girls to bully me again
Life is so weird

You know exactly what I meant and yet decided to completely disregard what I just wrote. Of course its less common for girls to do and of course its fucked up that a teen did something like this retards. But this thread wouldnt have existed if she was a teenage man. Get over the fact that OP only posted this because he romanticize the idea of changing/saving her just like all of those idiotic girls who obsess over criminals that men on this board constantly mock despite blatant hypocrisy 
And now its your cue to answer and gaslight me into thinking that this was not the intention at all.

i see your point but how do you know people will act on their impulses if they look dead behind the eyes. i feel like most people like that just suffer through life without ever doing anything extreme/.

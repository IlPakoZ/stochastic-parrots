Are these the same people that want to get legalize marriage to children as young as 12? Talk about shitbag politicians, amirite?
--- 73018686

They are indeed and now republicans are legalizing child labor to keep wages stagnant

So banning the grooming of kid by queers is hating queer people? Why is the grooming of kids so necessary to homosexuals? Also it's clear how these headlines come about. Progressive politicians fill these bills with pork totally unrelated to main legislation, and then when other politicians reject it based on that pork......groomer media generate these headlines.

And this does not disprove my point about the pork, it just proves this guy is a dirtbag. But you're point is because this guy groomed her, queers should be allowed to groom?

By your logic straights are grooming children and forcing their straightness on them.

Even underage marriage traditions aside, Trump is running in some very weird circles these days, with people like Ali Alexander and Milo and the occasional Republican politician investigated for jerking off near a school or hiring underage prostitutes. I'm not saying the Left doesn't do a ton of groomer shit, but boy is the Right doing its best to match it.
--- 73018844
>>73018825
Oh I agree, there are dirt bags on both sides. The difference is the groomers are not celebrated for their grooming on the right like some on the left.

Nice garbage "argument". Good thing it always boils down to this with you people and queer empowerment keeps getting momentum. This is not 1900s where you can't discredit Queers by calling them "mentally ill".

Yes and if the schizophrenics had as big and power lobby as the homosexuals and the deep state behind them they wouldn't be labeled mentally ill anymore too

kek these loony troons are just mad that an old man is stealing their trad wife and that this young female is rejecting their "progressive" ideology driving them further into their delusions.

They are literally mentally ill. I've never met a normal person that identifies as LGBTQ that denies having mental trauma. So you're either riding the bandwagon because you think it's cool, or, you're in denial about your mental state.

There's another problem, too, you faggots are so unstable that it's beneficial (for society) to appease you and pretend to play along while secretly judging you and excluding you from real society.

California is an economic powerhouse with a higher quality of life on average than Florida. Imagine being proud of being from Floria. That's like being proud of having downsyndrome or something.

Also, I'm not from California. Not sure why you think California is a part of this discussion other than you need to deflect (or distract?) from the fact that Florida is truly, truly hell on earth.

California could produce 2000% more GDP than Florida but it doesn't mean shit if it doesn't make it's way into people hands.

It's like my friends boasting about how they make 3 times more than me in London and at the same time ask how I'm able to pay a mortgage on a 4 bedroom house and have a nice car while they have one of those stupid fucking e-scooters and an apartment. At the end of the day how much more money you make means jack shit if most of it is taken in taxes, rent, mortgage, whatever.

There's a difference between having a story or a situation with two dads, or a tranny that happens to be there. Main character could even be a tranny. But when the situation becomes focused on the trans or homo or hetero aspect of the person, that's when it's indoctrination.

"Tom went to the grocery store with his wife"
is different than
"Tom and his wife, who are married, went to the grocery store, and as they went in, he slapped her behind and she bit her lip"

One's just describing what a couple is doing, and the other is obsessing over the straight aspect of the relationship, to the point of sexualizing it.

It's just as gross for a dude to be sleazing on women in a club as it is for a dude to be twerking in the middle of the street.

I hate this country so fucking much. I want to leave this country before it becomes more of a shithole than it already is. Fucking stupid cunts think that legalizing child brides is some fucking slam dunk on the pedo libtard trannies.
At this point they're just fighting over whether dempublicans or republicrats have the exclusive right to be pedophiles. America is a meme and it's filled with dysgenic retards that fight over what's in somebody's pants instead of uhh idk actually fixing actual problems.

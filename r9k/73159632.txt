What's actually good about relationships?
>Having someone to talk to
>The lighter forms of physical intimacy like cuddling and kissing
That's really all there is to it. Sex in itself is not a good or desirable thing at all--the stuff leading up to it is, but sex itself is honestly kinda gross. It's like a really stinky form of masturbation.
The point is, if you've ever chatted with fembots on here and felt some kind of closeness to them, you've already experienced HALF of what makes relationships enjoyable. The only thing you're missing is physical touch but that's really it. You certainly aren't missing out on anything by not having sex, planning your entire day around someone, and sharing a bed with someone--none of that stuff is even good. Sex smells bad, joint scheduling takes away your freedom, and sharing a bed exposes you to the smell of someone else's farts (which always smell much worse than your own).

I think you're pretty vastly underselling how critical that light physical touch is for helping keep people sane, and also while I agree people on here overstate the importance of sex, "you certainly aren't missing out on anything" is like a senior citizen or asexual take.

your entire psychological and nervous system is built only in the case of romantic and sexual interest that starts from late teens at the latest. it is simply how human beings are biologically preprogrammed, universally barring extreme rare deformities of mind.

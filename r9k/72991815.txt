Why aren't people as keen on believing misconduct allegations as before?

About 5-10 years ago, it seems we've finally convinced people that they should at least take them at face value. But in recent years, it appears they're more skeptical about them than ever.

Imagine believing foids. 

Foids are narcissists pathological liars and attention whores. Ewww a beta talked to me about work stuff, was it sexual harassment... well it is because I feel like it. This is the foid thought process.

Its almost as if falsely accusing men of sexual harassment has consequences for actual victims of genuine abuse. Shocking right?

Aside from the obvious bait, I can't imagine why some of us are sceptical now.

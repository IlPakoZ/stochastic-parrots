With a lot of toxic threads here I want to make this place just a bit better. So if you can wish your favorite person "May you be glad, may you be free and may you be at peace" then someone you don't really care other way and someone you hate then yourself by far the hardest one. I already did my and feel a bit better :3

thanks i was going to post something horny and unhinged and morally unquestionably fucked up and then i wasnt and then i saw your thread and was like ha ha ebil time i have to be an agent of chaos to keep the balance, then i went to make it and realized i shouldnt make posts like that for free and i shouldnt self incriminate before i have what i want so anyways i think your thread acted as a buffer to give my mind long enough to come to that decision so, yeah,

thanks

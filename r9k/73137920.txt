Reading, youtube, vidya, tv series and movies, anime, manga, music, psychoactive drugs and zombiebrowsing internet. Usually tend to focus on a single hobby at a time and cycle through these. Youtube, music, reading and zombiebrowsing + occasional drugs are a constant though. I read few hours every day before I go to sleep, watch youtube when I eat etc etc.
Been like this for 2 years since I become a shutin. Not happy and doubt I'll ever be but at least I don't have constant suicidal thoughts now like I did before I dropped out of society. I'll probably off myself when my parents die.
I live alone in an apartment thanks to neetbux.

I don't like the culture of sites like wizchan, but that does sound cozy if you like that sort of thing

i live with my sister and my mom. i've been neet for like 5 years now. it's crazy how quickly the time passes with nothing changing. like another anon i was frequently suicidal and every day was a challenge for me. becoming a shut in helped, but it did come at a cost.
i watch a lot of movies, play games (mostly roguelikes/ites), read webnovels, or watch online debates. again, like another anon, these come in phases. i also jerk off a lot.
recently i've been watching a lot of black comedies, but i want to get back into reading. i mostly like psychology but i read sociological stuff too. or i should be trying to improve my drawing skills, or going back to trying to writing cyoas.

Wizchan is r9k but ths guys there also hate "incels" and right wingers. The mods have also admitted to being gay multiple times and a huge chunk of the old Steam group became trannies.

I live alone. I wake up, do nothing because I no longer gain enjoyment from anything. I wait until I'm tired enough to go to sleep, then I repeat it all again. I really fucking hope I die in my sleep next time.

4chan, youtube, music. I didn't come to r9k for months, but now I'm back here all day. I should probably leave again but I have no one to talk to about this sort of stuff. It's pretty hard to go back to normie speak after being able to talk openly about shit that's important but normies won't even explicitly acknowledge is true or even exists
--- 73138913
>>73137920 (OP)
I cook, watch youtube, do chores and occasionally play games if I force myself to or have a mood for them. I honestly wish I could just walk around or hike all day, but my mom would get too worried or mad that Im not searching for job(when on PC I can just pretend.). 
Also, I live with my parents and Ive been neet for a solid year, after dropping out of college for a second time. Recently I went to the professional for my OCD, because I might aswell try since my life is shit anyway. Atleast I got more sympathy from parents.
Im not rulling out the possibility of getting a job, but my FOMO, guilt and general feeling of disappointment arent making things easier. Also my dad considers me as weak and unfit for physical labour and I consider myself as too anxious for customer oriented stuff and too demotivated and unfocused for high IQ pursuits.

I hate incels too and think you're all retards. Wizchan might not be terrible if it's as you say it is; I just assumed with it being a male virgin board incel rot would have found its way there

This ... and when you're female it's even worse, because people expect you to like feminism and all the virtue insanity. I never wanted to be "right" or anti-system, but I just became by oposing leftism and their god damned cultural revolution. Maybe I have to connect to a closed hardcore conservative comunity in the end ...

Thats the million dollar question. Its not like I would be happier while being a wage slave. But the lack of respect for being a neet isnt fulfilling either.

I miss the times when I would watch a loser locked inside his room speaking to a shitty camera about his niche hobby. Zoomers destroyed that. Back in 2012 if you had a sponsor you were a sell out. Now every single channel is a business.

--- 73142307
I'm learning to draw ATM, really fun, even though I can only do it a few hours because my depression wants me to go back to watching anime. I also ride my bike through the forest sometimes and workout on trees. I will maybe get a small job next week that will rehabilitate me, it's for mentally ill/old/retards by the government, it's only 15 hours a week and only 100 bucks on top of my neetbucks, but i think it's good to get me back into a normal life.

Im almost 3yo neet, cant muster the mind to do another soul crashing corp job. I had very long and kinda menagable depression and I just watched hundreds movies, tv shows, swam 3/4 times a week, all with my gf. Beside it i smoked mj and played strategy games. In recent weeks something changed in me and i started to create again (mainly drawing and writing) and i spend like 4-10h daily doing concepts, illustrations and lore for them. It gives me happiness and Im mad about myself that I didnt do it more frequently for so long. Now i cant find the time to watch and play stuff, because i prefer to create.

You mentioned that you want to learn to draw, dunno if you use any guide but dont redraw, especialy manga. It may seem like a good shortcut but it teaches you bad habits. Even if youre beginner redrawing should be only used when trying to understand specified technique (medium or technique of using said medium). Do yourself a favour and draw from nature or study some anatomy/inspiring albums.

This might seem like a bad thing at first, but the truth is that it keeps the brainrot of politics and crying about women at the door.
If you want to cry about women and tell everyone how much you need a girl to fix you you are allready at the right place

I'm using a guide, it says I should study/copy characters of artists I like. But I also do nature stuff on the side.
--- 73144211
>>73144100
Is it one of those manga guides? Eh, suit yourself, at least you draw something from nature. Redrawing can only lead you to emulate someone elses style, but your tryin to be mangaka so i just wasting my and your time.

Reading books, forums, listening music, playing games. It's boring but I'm so depressed those are everything I need. I live with parents and they don't really care because they know I'm a hopeless loser, I've tried many schools and jobs with every single one falling short. I'm also a friendless virgin, a complete disappointment.
--- 73144937

Mostly mindlessly browsing this site, youtube, and tiktok now. Playing games and watching shows, things I used to do a lot, feels more like a chore instead of something I do to actually have fun now. But I play live service games so I have to log in once in a while though I can honestly say I haven't enjoyed them for a long time. That's the problem with having little to do other than that for decade straight especially since I can't go out much anymore or constantly because of how much my overall health has been declining over just this past year alone. I've been studying Japanese but I hardly engage with the language outside of tiktok which is pretty much all I use it for is just a tiny bit of reading and listening practice. I am currently trying to read a bit of a book or manga each day just to try and form a habit hoping that if I can form a habit I can read more. I tried learning to draw but I gave up for what feels like the hundredth time on that because I can't enjoy it like I did as a kid anymore. The schools did such a good job beating that out of me by making something I enjoy into a graded waste of time. I would like to work but because of how my brain makes my life harder than it needs to because somehow I fucked it up and my health problems I can't. I live on welfare and honestly I can't ever see getting off of it because even if by some miracle some employer is retarded enough to hire me I will be fired within two weeks
--- 73144939
I wish I could find a GF as neet. I mean I probably could if I really tried. I am just so self concious and ashamed of being a neet. I shouldn't be, every man should live like he wants to and not be controlled by society.

I live of welfare, I'm fit and good looking. Problem is my mind, if I think about trying to look for a GF that is okay with me being a neet, I know that my life will drastically change, and do I really want that? Do I REALLY want a women in my life? Then the doubt comes, the bargaining and the downplaying of a GF.

This cycle repeats it'self over and over again. I live a happy life here. I live in my own House (Don't ask) live of welfare, downstairs is my mother which has 2 horses. Girls love horses right? I don't have a drivers licence though which is a must here..well I can work on that. Maybe I'll look for my comfy neet gf very soon. I simply say I'm a minimalist and despise paying taxes because I'm a freeminded nonslave or some bullshit.

Eat lunch with mom, drink coffee, play with cats
Browse 4chan/YT on my phone until 15:30
Take fat shit and fap at 16:00
Go in the backyard, jump rope, do pullups, clean the place up, play with cats again until 17:30
Prepare and drink tea with mom at 18:00
Do whatever until 20:30, prepare dinner with mom, eat dinner

Yes you could because I did and Im 30 balding Neet and have no social skills but i do t believe in incels being a thing anymore however I did try with over 60 women and maybe 3 showed any interest including the one I ended up with she is not a Neet anymore so now I just sit at home waiting for her to get back from her job and I still want to die it didnt solve anything and sex is not even THAT good its just good

I estimate 1/3 of my day is wasted online. Could be less than that. I have been slowly regenerating and regaining my ability to function over many years since my schizo episode like Sauron regaining his physical form.

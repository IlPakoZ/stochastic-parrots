Maybe prob just average though. I was getting some matches before so I assumed it was this

If someone would avoid matching you because they see you're introverted dating them would just go badly anyway

Introverted = beta 
You're telling women you're beta.

The right girl for you doesn't use a fucking app to find you. Do shit that interests you and join groups of like minded people. One of them will be a much more likely match.

Not OP but are hiking meetups good places to meet women? What about running meetups?

This is such Reddit advice. There's no such thing as magical groups of people that operate like MMO guilds where you can just butt in.

The only realistic way to meet people is by either getting a job, or using a dating app. There is legitimately no other option to meet anyone unless you wanna bang church grannies.

That is such bullshit. Your hobby/interest has to be extremely niche for there not to be a club/competition/conference/networking/social event of some kind somewhere. What's magical about that?

Why wouldn't there be? Women aren't going to these to hook up but if you widen your social circlw to include people like you then the odds of finding someone you connect with are far higher.

I don't think video games or walking local park trails is a niche hobby, dude. Nor playing the keyboard or reading. Literally everything I enjoy, is not possible to share with anyone else.

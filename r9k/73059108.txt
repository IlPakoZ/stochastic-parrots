Do men have feelings that aren't rage and cockiness?

Healthy men feel nothing but pride and anger

Dead inside and pretend to have feelings to make others more comfortable because I'm not strong enough to just be myself

Nah but fr, wtf are you doing
Men who show any emotions other than rage and cockiness are usually shamed as weak not even by other men but by women that see his losing control as weakness

I would argue that people shouldn't be feeling much aside from general content in an ideal state

Saying that you should feel something makes it like you're pressuring someone to have fake emotions. Most of the time, people should exist in a stoic uncaring state. That's healthy, for men and women. It puts you above others whether that was your intention or not

idk have you tried reading every single love poem in the world? something women are incapable of creating because they cant feel love toward human beings, only money? or just look through history and how many men sacrificed everything for their women, including their lives
dumb fucking hole

As we all know, there's a large contingent of misogynists on /r9k/ who are hell bent on driving women off the platform. These chuds are great in number, but there's a whole lot of us WOMAN WORSHIPPERS, ready to take up the cause of the fair sex. With that in mind, I recommend that we use this thread to talk about the many times that we have worshipped women IRL by doing things such as:
>Simping for a woman.
>Falling on our knees before a woman.
>Licking a woman's feet.
>Kissing a woman's ass (literally or figuratively).
>Giving a woman loads of compliments.
>Generally losing all self control in a love-fueled frenzy inspired by a woman's beauty.
Don't be shy boyos, I know that most of you have done at least one or two of these things in your life at some point, so step right up and share your stories. The fembots are feeling left out and there's no better time than now to to show them your love and support.

Incredible. This threads is tremendously based

>posting my juicy simping stories of Kacey so femcelbots can schlick

a loyal simp never tattles.

I think I figured it out. I need to worship women in some way because hating them so far hasn't worked. I'm dead serious. I may get played by some whores along the way but I feel like this is a good strategy.

>>73191950 (OP)
I've done literally every single one of those things for women, multiple women in fact. I love women so much I can't handle It sometimes. One time a girl made me get on my knees for her and laughed at me and I've never blushed harder

No, there's a way that works in it neither involves hating women nor worshipping them.
You have to be normal and not weird and don't come across as desperate or clingy or angry, and you have to take a woman out to do something fun like go to a zoo, and then you escalate with some light physical touching like putting your hand around her or rubbing your legs against hers when you're sitting down together (and of course use eye contact to tell if she's into this or not), and then at some point give her an excuse to go some place private with you like saying maybe you could go to your place or a hotel and have a couple drinks and watch a movie, and then if she's down for that you basically got free rein to do outright kissing / foreplay / undressing working up to sex and if you want her still after that you'll also have a girlfriend.

I interact with zero women in my life, I can't simp for them even if I wanted to

>on a random discord
>people posting pics but nothing revealing
>i post one of mine and add a girl commenting about them
>practically beg her for feet pics like a total loser
>she actually does it but only in exchange for me showing her my cum
>later tell her all my fantasies about feet and she entertains them, but we stop talking because i feel completely embarassed over how horny i was
as a low value moid i realize that i have nothing to offer besides my penis and face, and that's the best expeirence i'll ever be able to have

Okay I want to help you guys so listen closely.
>Who are you?
A 30 year old cis, vol-cel cis woman. A relationship is an extension of a friendship. That's the secret. You literally can not be in a relationship with someone if you wouldn't be friends with them if they swapped sex. Not really interesting in a woman as a friend? Then don't try for a relationship because it's doomed to fail. That's it. That's all there is too it.
>Why aren't you in a relationship
I'm fuckin broken lmao leave me alone to my japanese animes.

>One time a girl made me get on my knees for her and laughed at me and I've never blushed harder
A girlfriend made me do this once in high school and I wasn't in the least bit embarrassed because I'm an autist and I had absolutely no clue what 'submissive body language' was at that point in my life. She could just command me to do things--she didn't 'ask,' she TOLD--I'd do them without the slightest hesitation. Now that I learned that this is 'submissive' behavior and is considered shameful for a grown man, I might hesitate more, but I'd still ultimately do it because I find it hot lol.

And people wonder how guys develop femdom fetishes LMAO. I can really relate to your story there, I'm autistic and never knew better. Girls were very cruel to me in school and as an adult I seek out abusive women

Nietzche said this too. It seems to make sense although I'm still not marrying a woman who doesn't inspire me to prostrate myself before her, I just need one who is also a friend in addition to that.

I've fucked up after the return to my house several times. I just froze up, the women were extremely uncomfortable.

she wasn't abusing me at all, she was just in charge, these were situations when she'd be giving me handjobs and shit, for context.

That's a good sign you got them to your house. Just practice with more women and more dates and you'll get over it. Try thinking of anxiety as excitememt, like you're enjoying a roller coaster or a suspense thriller movie.

dumbass modern mindset. men and women are different i wouldn't be platonic friends with a woman beyond being friendly with the gfs/wives of my friends or friends of my gf/wife. Some of these women might see me as their friend but they are delusional. Any male female (close) friendship is basically a guy beta orbiting.

Women's beauty standards are based on what men find attractive.

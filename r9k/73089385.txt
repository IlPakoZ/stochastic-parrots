I'm always agruing with people online even when I don't intentionally set out to do so.
I'm beginning its less of a website problem and more of a personality problem

Try going offline for a while and see how it changes, being chronically online brings out the worst in people.

I enjoy being kind and accepting to people on 4chan more than arguing. People here tend to default into arguing and arguing back is just what they expect or even want. Being nice to them and saying they have a good point etc always disarms them and is fun. If you're worried about arguing too much, 4chan is a good place to start I think.

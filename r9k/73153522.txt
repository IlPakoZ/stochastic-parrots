i think that men are attracted to little girls in the scarcity of teenaged and adult women because they have almost all of the characteristics of post pubertal women. ideally they would probably prefer a post pubertal woman who naturally has fine light body hair and smooth skin. im a girl in my teens now and when i was a little kid i had a lot of men that you wouldnt think were pedophiles try to start sexual relationships with me.

>want so badly... impossible perfection, even if it means being lied to, as long as we never find out

This is the shallow person's creed for everything, not just women. They want to play make-believe 24/7 and pretend life is something that it isn't and their relationships aren't transactional and people "love" you for existing. They lose their shit when the veil is lifted and act like they've been personally wronged.

Society, its standards, everything that doesn't involve throwing spears at our prey for food is bullshit we craft as we develop ideals of how things should be.

Human beauty is a social construct, hunter-gatherer tribes have yet to hold any beauty pageants (probably because you can't tell the women apart). The ideal of human beauty forms from cultural experiences during adolescence. What you see around you and what others influence you to know as "beauty". If you were in the forest, the skankiest, most dirt-caked, calloused butt would be the hottest thing in the universe to you.

Are we being raided by crystal cafe? You could have ended it after the first three words. I don't give a rats ass about body hair or make up or anything.
--- 73153833
For the most part it's true. Beauty comes from within and is effortless. Your outward appearance is just an expression of the goodness within. That's why men hate fat women, tattooed, dyed hair, and piercings so much. These women are ugly on the inside and go to great lengths to make sure they are equally revolting to the eyes.
Beauty is natural and most of the time anything a woman tries to add only betrays her ugly nature by putting it in the spotlight. Don't be fat, don't be a slut, wear normal clothes that women are supposed to wear. That's basically all men are asking for.

Men all want a subservient dumb 20 year old but most of them can't get that. What they really want is a fangirl to pump up their ego. If you can flatter them and act dumber than them and never have any needs of your own, looks aren't important, but they will still cheat on you with someone hot if they have the slightest opportunity, no matter how good looking you are. They are trash.

You are a retard. All of the data we have points directly to women being dramatically more picky than men when it comes to sex/relationships. Eg speed dating stats, online dating data, books like Dataclysm. Idiots like you who want to act like both sides are equal in this dilemma are totally full of shit.

Men are just so dumb that they can see a woman with a full face of "natural" makeup and think she's barefaced. That's what they mean when they say they want a girl who looks good without makeup.

Men want zero responsibility and a lapdog to bolster their fragile egos. Then when their partner does everything to please them and be subservient they get angry and cheat.

Checked and I think it's true. I think all humans are shallow and want the pretty people's attention so much -- they'll do anything to get it and have it.

This is true. It's just fertility. Sex is about making babies first, humans ignore that. We want to make babies quickly, who will look cute and get attention and be raised properly. Young girls do that.

>>73153632

If looks aren't important to you, why are you posting a pic of a 20 year old model then, I don't get it. I don't think looks are as important as OP posits, I think what men want is someone to prop up their ego.

No, not really. I mean smooth skin is nice and it would definitely be nicer if what we saw wasn't so artificial but instead just how they genuinely were but hair color doesn't matter too much and as long as you're not as plastic as a barbie doll or wearing makeup thick enough that it may as well be a mask then it's fine.

I'm an older millennial and am lucky enough that my wife and I are HS sweethearts (based rural wisconsin life), but I'm pretty sure all these things are possible for women to do.

>Virginal blondes
Yeah, the only requirement here is to be blonde and not have sex, that isn't hard at all.

>Word about peroxide
I'm not sure why this matters, what does peroxide do for women? 

>skin that doesn't need any cream to stay soft, we want legs that don't need razors to stay smooth.
Women already do this though? My wife always says its estrogen that keeps her soft, its natural. She isn't a girly girl and grew up on a cattle farm, she's always enjoyed being outside and gardening, so maybe being active and getting vitamin D is important for this? As for smooth legs, even if women don't shave, their leg hairs are way softer than men's, and if she has blonde hair they're hardly visible. 

The rest is just nonsense. From reading that passage, am I safe to assume it was written by a non-white female living in a western country? It reads like just seething that the men she lusted after only wanted white women.

That's not true, but I can definitely see some men being ducks about it. Your conclusion as to why men seek dumb women is wrong though. Women usually want someone who is better and it would be a waste of time for him to chase the smart one. Even if we say it isn't for the sake of argument, that doesn't matter. At the end of the day he will believe it and act accordingly. It's pretty normal for people not to try and date x person because they believe they aren't good enough for them. Even the other person does indeed like them, they have very a hard time accepting it.

>Robots, do you agree with this statement?
Lmao no.

>Is this really how the average man sees women?
No. This is probably close to many men's idealized fantasy but despite the grouching of women on the subject men are keenly aware that real women are as disgusting as they are (if not more so, albeit in different ways) and go to great pains with makeup and grooming to project transient beauty and for the most part men do not really care if this ideal is not met because it's only a minor component of the main issue (and diminishes somewhat as a relationship deepens and partners age), which is both a two-way street and pretty simple: making an effort to please your partner. For women this could take the form of taking pains with one's appearance before going out in public or getting better at domestic tasks or even taking on some extra labor to give her man some free time to go do a hobby and for a man this could take the form of cooking and running a bath for her before she gets home from a bad day at work or consistently hitting the gym to stay in shape for her or sacrificing down time to do maintenance on the house or car or whatever.

Point is, you're making an effort to make your partner happy in ways that are only obliquely at best related to sexual gratification and men and women are pleased by different things. A man might really have his heart lifted by having a woman who turns heads on his arm at a social function while a woman's heart might flutter while her man is toiling shirtless in the heat to make her a greenhouse.

Of course, the internet has fucked a lot of this so good luck to everyone I guess. Women can sleep around with the cream of the crop without incurring any stigma while many males have essentially given up on competing in any other arena after seeing their sexual competition. As such, women cry about everything other than sex while men say "why bother at all for a whore?" and spend their time on cooming and funko pops and shit.

Help me understand this. You'd rather just stay ignorant than have someone who loves you and is passionate about something explain it to you? I'd fall in love with a girl if she had a sperg monologue about whatever.

Men don't expect perfection from women, we want a certain threshold of beauty that indicates to us subconsciously you can bare healthy children and HUMILITY about your flaws. 

Sluts with high body counts never have trouble getting guys despite not being ideal do you know why, real whores are humble and penitent to their men about their flaws.

I'm starting to feel this whole thread is a psyop. Like a bunch of redditors from inceltears or some shit had an idea to reverse the roles to make us realize how stupid these baseless generalizations are. I'll be honest it's working. I don't even want a girlfriend if they're going to be like this.

Yes, that's the point. But in this case it's not a selfish motivation, it's to make her partner look better. Did you not read the rest of the post?

That's the part where you're wrong. Think of women as if they're running a 24/7 PR campaign

No men don't think like that at all. There is natural beauty and there is constructed beauty. Men can easily tell the difference. When you shave your legs and put on heavy makeup, men see that as you signaling you are an easy lay. The women that are naturally beautiful are the women men actually want to marry. It sounds like that was written by a whore who wants to propagate the idea that there is no natural beauty because it lets her feel good about being a whore/lying about her body count. Something like "I put on makeup to be pretty for you so it is okay if I lie to you about my body count as well" sort of logic.

You forgot to mention that it is also projection, because while men don't care if women perfectly live up to the standard of beauty laid out in the image, most modern women absolutely do not accept a man not living up to the masculine ideal in any way. This is why you get so many stories of women becoming unattracted to their boyfriends if they get injured, cry, express any sort of insecurity at any time, etc. This is also why men just aren't interested in dating anymore. It's like having a tiger mom but she doesn't actually love you and instead of doing it so you can have a better life, she is doing it at your expense so she can look better to her friends. Believe it or not being an Asian highschool student isn't all that fun.

Eh, I dunno about that. I think the issue is that the internet meat market has allowed women to keep up those ridiculous standards whereas in the past they'd be snapped out of it in HS if not earlier. When there's a finite number of "chads" and their sexual history is much less opaque, women can't get away with what they get away with today and they're well aware of that and end up settling.

I think that is pretty much what I'm saying. It isn't Chads though, because even Chads don't live up to these standards. They're basically like overgrown little girls who still see their daddy as an invincible Greek god and that is what they compare all men to. I wonder if the actual cause of this lack of maturity is actually just a lack of hearing men's perspectives, since they have no fathers and men's opinions are dismissed and ignored culturally? So men remain to them as these sort of mystical creatures and their only interaction with them is getting fucked by Chads (which is where the myth of men only wanting sex comes from).

>I think that is pretty much what I'm saying. It isn't Chads though, because even Chads don't live up to these standards.
Physically they do, though, and that's the point. Because there's no stigma to sleeping around, women can basically ALWAYS get laid by men they find attractive whenever they want. By the time they emotionally mature enough to want to be valued for more than their holes, they're already well into "lmao no" territory as far as serious relationships with (I hate to use this roastoid term but it fits) those same high-value males that they've been sleeping around with. They have no idea what they want in a partner or a relationship apart from the physical aspect because they've been (literally) fucking around through the latter portion of their formative years and so they quickly settle with some desperate sucker and the relationship is garbage and they're both unhappy.

>They're basically like overgrown little girls who still see their daddy as an invincible Greek god and that is what they compare all men to.
Disagree. Many of them have horrible relationships with their fathers.

>I wonder if the actual cause of this lack of maturity is actually just a lack of hearing men's perspectives, since they have no fathers and men's opinions are dismissed and ignored culturally?
It comes from stunted emotional growth due to a prolonging of latter childhood vis a vis stigma-free casual sex on tap.

>So men remain to them as these sort of mystical creatures
More like subhumans, unfortunately. They're either uncaring studs who only want them for their bodies or easily manipulated creeps who also only want them for their bodies but which they can slip a leash on.

>and their only interaction with them is getting fucked by Chads (which is where the myth of men only wanting sex comes from).
And simps, which is just as bad because they come to believe that men will do anything for a crumb of pussy no matter how you treat them otherwise.

I had it all. The perfect year after years of depression, anxiety and psychosis. I was content with what I had. I didn't care about girls or friends even. I was always a loner anyways
I used to go for nightwalks and chill by myself. It was the greatest year of my life but I fucked up along the line. I may have 'offended' God or committed an iniquity in the universe
Up to this day I still don't know the exact thing that caused my "fall from grace". Only a few incidents leading up to it. All I know is things have never gotten back to how they used to be
It's been 5 years 1/2 of this. There's very little I can do to change it because I can't change the hearts of men only God can do that. If I try to move it would be the same, since I already experimented with that idea. 
Well this is going to be a slow and dull life.

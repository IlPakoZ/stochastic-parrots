> I know some robots think that abortion is a much more humane alternative than, for that child to be born into a miserable life
But don't you think that abortion is just another example of how selfish and avoidant of accountability women are
They want to have sex with every guy that tickles their fancy, but hate that they should have to have to deal with the consequences of that
> Rape, incest, mothers life being at risk are less than 4% of all abortions, meaning that 96% are elective
Why is modern society so filled with constant moral hazard, especially if you're a woman
> There is almost nothing a woman can do in modern society that women will ever actually have to face the consequences for
For women accountability is saying I'm sorry and that's it, nothing more
I read some shit on Reddit, about this guy, with a 14yo SIL that got pregnant by her 15 yo bf and then lied and said it was him, and then his life was basically ruined until it was proven otherwise, but the 14yo had nothing bad that happened to her

Yeah but imagine what that child would have to go through if it was born. Probably born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, either raised in a broken home or given out to adoption (probably staying an orphan). For the sake of the kid, jt is best for abortion to be fully legal. No child that comes out of a woman who would have aborted it if she had the chance will live a healthy life.

You're presenting a pretty bad faith argument to get r9k to agree with your prolife views.

Did anyone else experience that or know what I'm talking about? I started masturbating when I was 9-10 but didn't really know how to do it properly, just squeezed myself until it went from feeling good to painful. At 13 I learned how to do it right, that you had to go up and down, but I remember an intoxicating shivering feeling, cold yet soothing, not dissimilar from nitrous oxide in the doctor's chair, except under my skin. I stopped for a moment, but then continued. Right as I was about to cum it really intensified, next thing I knew there was sticky stuff everywhere and the sensation gradually subsided, like fading nausea. I swore never to masturbate again and then proceeded to the very next day. While the typical warm tingles of masturbation intensified and fapping got better and better, I grew a tolerance of the initial cold crawling intoxication, and within days or maybe weeks it disappeared entirely. Sometimes I wonder if heroin feels like that, just a lot stronger?

I'm a khv with effectively zero sexual experience. One time in college at 20 I accidentally tasted the breath of a girl in biology lab, and almost immediately felt the warmest, kindest goosebumps-shivers across my whole body. I had an instant erection, masked only by my lab coat, and was in a state of heat for weeks, but I was happy. Though it reinvigorated an urge to have sex, it didn't make me sad; if anything tasting her breath allowed me to enrich my masturbation. That was the closest thing I've had to a sexual experience. Because I'm a bit autistic, I never even felt aware of sex being real, even in college; seemed like most students talked about video games, movies, sports, etc anyways. Sometimes I'd overhear discussion of parties, and of course I would assume sex happened at them, but then again I also assumed sex happens in many houses and hotels across the city, so what? And thus I continued masturbating happily without too much worry, fully accepting that I'll die a virgin.

I bring it up because today, about 20 years after my first successful ejaculation, now 33, I've felt the cold shivers again. I live in a condo, and sometimes hear my neighbors upstairs, just bump bump bump noises. Often those noises would turn me on and I'd masturbate to porn or fantasies of them. No biggie; honestly wasn't even 100% certain it was sex, could have been an exercise machine. Today the noises were a little louder and earlier in the day than normal, and by coincidence I had started watching porn 5 minutes before, so I positioned myself up against the wall and put my ear up to it. After a few seconds of acclimation, I heard it clearly and unmistakably, the sound of her moaning. 

My conscious said "Nice" and I began touching myself, but then the reality of it set in. The rawness of the bed creaking yes of course, but also the intimacy, the love between a couple, the reality of it. This was real sex between real people I knew and it was just a few feet away from me, shielded only by a bit of paneling and insulation. The first wave of cold shivers was instantaneous, almost reverberating from my torso to my limbs and back. My erection shriveled up almost immediately, but I still stood there for 45 minutes, touching myself. I still felt some kind of arousal, I was certainly transfixed, yet all the warm happy dumb feelings that porn and fantasy usually gave me were absent. In the last few minutes of their love-making session she almost sounded like she was crying, and soon he lets out a large scream. Near-silence for about a minute, slight barely-discernible sounds, then suddenly footsteps running to the bathroom, a flushing toilet, and the shower turns on. I'm left shivering, shuffle awkwardly back to the porn on my computer. I switch it to a favorite, and one which somewhat resembled the circumstances of what happened upstairs, expecting a new, fresh masturbation experience. Instead I'm at half-mast the entire time, and cum feeling empty.

I'm having stronger suicidal ideation right now than I've had in quite some time. No they're probably not serious thoughts, yes I'm sure I'll sleep and feel better tomorrow, or if not then, then maybe in a week or month. And I would never kill myself anyways, don't report me. But the pointlessness and emptiness of my existence has never seemed clearer to me. I don't know what will happen. Maybe tomorrow I'll embrace it and start listening in regularly, just as my initial cold shiver 20 years ago turned happy; is this how cuckolds and voyeurs are born? Right now my mind feels almost empty, I had to stare into nothingness for a while before writing these posts. But I know I can never go back, and that my chances of ever finding true happiness are zero. Oh well...

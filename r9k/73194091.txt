If I enjoyed playing vidya or just doing fucking nothing it would be better than browsing the internet. Being told I'm a loser over and over and over again isn't really useful, but for some reason I keep coming back to this shithole and not doing useful things or even fun things instead. And yet when I don't have the internet I even feel weird. This piece of shit useless brain evolved to hunt not to do this shit fuck, I just wanna be happy man.

>go outside
>nothing happens
>just enjoy going for long walks alone

But to your point, there used to be common indoor activities that people could enjoy and relate to others about, like TV shows, movies, news, video games, books, music. Now you have an unlimited variety of all these, plus infinite possibilities for things you can do on the internet. I still prefer it though, 4chan is usually more entertaining and actually useful than all of the above activities. Though I basically an terminally online, I still make sure to walk outside for a few hours every day, and do some basic fitness routines at home.

I just want to go back to when I could spend the entire day playing Oblivion and not have a care in the world about anything happening outside of the game.

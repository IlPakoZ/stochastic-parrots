How are people still dumb enough to do hard drugs like heroin and cocaine? Don't they see all the people who got btfo by those drugs? Its like walking off a cliff. Personally I don't even drink alcohol because I've seen so many people fuck their lives over it.

>>73182147 (OP)
Because it feels good, you retard. It feels so good they're willing to throw their lives away over it. You're not going to get that kind of feeling by any natural means in life, may as well go out with a bang.

All women have done something like this, not necessarily with meth. But with marijuana, meth, crack, alcohol, cocks, etc.

You missed out. All the pretty young women that have ever existed did this and partied hard with tall handsome abusechad and drained his balls down their throats while you were languishing. You missed out on youthful fun, the point of life, now you just have the everlasting grind and then death to look forward to.

If you've reached the point where you're doing heroin, you're done. You've clocked out of life. You don't want to do anything else but get high. It doesn't matter if your life gets fucked by it or if you od and die in an hour, because you truly don't care anymore.

You are a hypocrite. Many lives are fucked over by social media. Let me guess, this place makes you feel good or entertained and you can leave any time?

Unironically yes. If your logic for avoiding all drugs is because you saw some people go too far with them, then you should have a really healthy diet too. No sarcasm needed, some people are just biased over dumb shit

>How are people still dumb enough to do hard drugs like heroin and cocaine?
While there is no single thing that points out why I will say this. Simply being a conscious human being is a rough trip. You reach a certain point where it dawns on you that you are only getting older, you will eventually die, and the older you get the harder life is going to get.

People do drugs and especially hard drugs when their lives are so shitty, empty or hellish; that they would do literally anything to escape it for a while.

On the flip side some people are just straight hedonists so in those cases softer drugs lead to harder ones in the never ending quest to be in a constant state of pleasure.
--- 73182302
>>73182147 (OP)
because your life fucking sucks and you wonder if the monotonous dredge and feeling like a loser is all there is to it so you try this drug thing everyone was always talking about to see what the fuzz is about. people rarely go from sober straight to heroin, their life is usually pretty defined by substance abuse already. people who use coke more than a couple of times are either rich kids playing wolf of wall street or 30+ people trying to pretend they're young again.
i dont get shit like meth or crack tho. its thankfully hard to come by in my country but i guess if people are slinging that shit in every neighborhood people are going to use it.

Nobody said it was a comparison, goober. The kid said she doesnt drink alcohol because she saw some people get too fucked up on it. So she should not be here either.

To be fair if your dad is white you have a 100% chance of being molested by him or his brother.

Nope, its a balancing act and being smart enough to see what risk are worth it. Social media has far more positives than alcohol and far less negatives. Its not without its problems but its far from so destrutive that choosing to indulge is flat out dumb.
--- 73182442
>>73182147 (OP)
Quite often it's people in not-so-nice situations who end up doing drugs. Then add to that the fact that the feeling you get from heroin is so fucking overwhelming that it's quite literally the best thing you've ever experienced.
--- 73182483
>>73182147 (OP)
I wouldn't tru heroin but nothing is going to happen to you if you consume a little of cocaine like 2 or 3 times/year.

I am excited, this week I am going to the other side and the truth is that I have nothing to lose anymore, I'm hopeless, I am going with the mentality of buying a bag of 10 cocaine rocks, 2 or 3 bags of 0.6g. I want to get one first line, followed by a crack hit? how would it hit?

Drugs are great. Heroin takes all your worldly concerns and reduces them down to one - get more heroin. If you can't see the value in that, I just don't know what to tell you.

I've done both (no, never injected) and they were really fun. Still not as good as Ketamine. I couldn't really have a dependence issue with them because they are so expensive and hard to get.
--- 73183458

Also, I'll give you the unspoken blackpill on addiction - people whose lives are ruined by drugs (or gambling, or booze, or insert whatever) are absolutely worthless, pathetic, weak, losers. If it's not heroin, it will be computer cleaner. It's not the drugs, alcohol or slot machines - it's the users. A very small minority of the human poplatuon is just useless.

People use to talk about weed being a gateway drug but stuff like percs and xanax really are like that. They don't seem as harmful because they come right from a doctor, but its basically just diluted opioids, so some kids get into it thinking its just lesser drug like weed or drinking, then it snowballs because its so addicitve.

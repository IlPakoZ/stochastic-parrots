Thank you for the well wishes anyhow.
--- 73080968
honestly i'd love to have a fujo friend, most women are either not interested in talking or want to date me.
--- 73080992
I'd be fine with that, as long as she treated me like a human and not fashion accessory or just was my friend for woke points.
--- 73080993
Women ain't interested in talking to me either, never had any want to date me though. Too much of a sperg, I suppose.

The Japs knew what they were doing when they made guts and griffth. They wanted to turn western youth into faggots and they knew it. There is no reason to make such a sexo male characters unless you were trying to make someone into a fag.
--- 73081134
>>73081090
I just think that they just aren't opposed to making attractive male characters.

Western cartoons are just ugly in general.
--- 73081150
you say you love guts but are you disability advocate HUH faggot? do you ever stop and think about how to improve accessibility for people who may have impaired vision or a missing limb?? you will never heal him and make him whole like that NERD

You're not supposed to remove them, you keep them on for like 3-4 months, and you rotate them now and then so that the skin doesn't get stuck and clean with a swab with saline solution.

(now if this i am really sorry, that would suck)
--- 73082232
well decided to cook the steak in the skillet. Bad idea, outside is burned but inside isn't cooked enough for my liking. Eating it anyway, but it's really tough and fatty. 

using this as a test run for my birthday dinner, but if this is what happens then I think I'll just do pizza.
--- 73082238

Just watch YouTube videos on how to do it if you're unsure
--- 73082299
>>73082260

I did that, along with reading a couple recipes. Could it be because I don't have a cast iron skillet and was just using a regular one?

Yeah, doing high temperature on nonstick ware will gas yourself.
--- 73082391
>>73082352

In the end more than half of it is uneatable. The fat won't cut and what I do get I have to chew for five minutes to be able to swallow. A complete and utter failure, just like myself. 

I'm still hungry as fuck and now need to decide if I want to cook some frozen stuff or just order a pizza.

If you're having difficulties just cut it horizontally so that it's thinner and cook it for a bit medium temperature
--- 73082437

You could try making it a stirfry, id say get a pizza if you're not feeling well
*hugshugs*
You're not a failure storynony
--- 73082477
>>73082402

I've actually thrown the rest away. It had almost no flavor either. I'm going to order a pizza now.

If I see these on sale again I might again another one and try it in the oven like mom used to. But that takes 2 hours and I was really hungry after mowing the grass.
--- 73082492

Anyone ever been arrested? Is it as hot as I think it is? I got caught once for underage drinking and tried to run but the cops caught me and pulled me down off a fence and questioned me about drugs. I didn't have any and wasn't high, eventually they let me and my friends go with a warning. 
--- 73082914

--- 73082992
>>73082897
Yes arrested, no it wasn't hot. The reality of being chained up against your will is dehumanizing and physically uncomfortable and it's made that way intentionally. Backseat of the cop car is too small for your legs to fit and they leave you baking in the summer heat for hours. There's a lot of time spent digesting in the bowels of bureaucratic machinery like that. Chained to a bench all day hungry and holding your bee to see a judge for five minutes and be told to come back in three months.

He eats sweets all the time In the show. I don't think they actually show him eating normal food. Though I haven't seen the show in half a decade. To be honest I don't remember anything after L dies.

Good advice however I do not like being around other people irl. I hate being in the public eye. I just want one person to be close to. Us vs the World. Of course this is a complete fantasy scenario crafted by some shut in. The Robots dilemma. Hates others but also wants a partner.

also do you wear it out in public?
--- 73084708

You are actually talking to two posters. But yea i made it theoretically thick enough to stop a wheelock pistol according to the papers. And no but I'm considering making a medieval camping video wearing the armor.

>>73084708
>two posters
Yeah I realized that when I updated the page and saw you replied. I'm a bit tarded mang. 

>but yeah i theoretically thick enough to stop a wheellock pistol 
well you gotta buy one to see. If a wheellock brandishing bandit breaks into your home. That armor could mean life and death. Also what's the diffrence between a wheellock and a flintlock pistol?
--- 73084814
It makes me sad that i see he is also awake when it's almost dawn. Just go to sleep already, baka ;-;
--- 73084815
>>73084749
Wheelocks are really complicated and fragile. They use a spring loaded friction wheel for the spark. They also use weaker charges depending on the era. There's a slight chance you might me able to kill me anon.

True I guess. I don't like how usernames have changed over time. I've started seeing usernames with pronouns in them. Its strange. People continue to shove their weird sexuality stuff into their usernames . I miss usernames where its something like "Redbarron18". I also have started hating people with unusuals. How much of a lap dog do you have to be for valve a company which hates your guts to open crates or trade in the year of our lord 2011 plus 12?

unironically you have to hate yourself to live in a major American city. Places like Paris may be huge shitholes but they European charm due to the architecture and historical value. Yet people are very prideful of their cities here. They will defend their shithole like its the greatest city to ever grace our earth. Especially New Yorkers and Philadelphians. I may be some rural bumpkin but at least I don't have to deal with going on a New York city subway everyday,

A it depends. If you're in like a suburb built in the 70s in a more rural area it can be nice but Mc Mansion suburbs are completely soulless but at least there you don't need to deal with all the undesirables of the city.

Being around old people just feels more comfortable because they aren't thinking about you. They're too busy thinking about how they're gonna go fishing with Joe on sunday after church. They also aren't as loud as young people. I enjoy living in my boomer hamlet because of this.

It does not make you a snake to feel gratitude at the downfall of someone who is immoral and who infects the thread. Yes i do not like transsexuals normalfags attention whores. They had bfs in past. They felt the need to get a recognizable image on a anonymous imageboard and even then their image is of a transexual from a shitty gacha game.

Apparently these days most mods use datapack recipes? Is this referring to the recipe jsons that are generated by the recipe generator? I'm wondering if there's any downsides to using KubeJS versus coding your own addon mod to alter recipes. Now that I think about it, since the game reads all the recipes from the jsons anyways there shouldn't be a performance issue with using KubeJS.

complaining because he attaches an image to every post, which is why he started doing it and its absence is why nobody cared before, not complaining or pointing out that these are posts on repeat that were largely ignored before. its hilarious and sad for multiple reasons

yeah i firmly belive the only love a man can get is from another man. i kind of feel like bisexuals are in the same position as women though so, consider that before you promise anything to anyone
good physique though

--- 73102022
I dont like muscular people. I like it more when the arm has a slight soft bulge from the muscle underneath instead of a hard outline. Same thing with the stomach, when he flexes his stomach a soft outline of abs is nice but its bad if its too rigid and if it is apparent even when not flexing.
Also guys who have chicken legs look kind of weird but I don't know what causes it so I won't judge.

Yes but not nigger ugly. Plus racemixing is wrong even if its homosexual. People should stick with their own generally. Unless they are a cute Asian boy with oval glasses then they should stick with me and like kiss me and stuff. You feel me homie.

I think I understand. Be wary though, fren.

Sorry anon. When i read similar posts they make me almost cry. You shouldn't want anyone to miss you tho. It just hurts
>Couldn't you love someone who deserves it instead?
No one i know deserved it more than him. It is me who sucks and is useless. I hope he is happy.
--- 73112291
>>73112194
Thanks, fren. I think for a lot of people they just focus on what gets to them the most and personally for me a lot of what makes something erotic is the situation, less so the act.
>I'm not a very patient person but this is just making it somehow even worse.
It is really annoying how long its been, I've rewatched it a few times too. Iirc Demon Slayer came out at about the same time and that's on its third season and it had a movie too.

I never could get into Demon Slayer despite... well ... him. Still have fantasies about him sometimes.

I remember reading its manga when it was getting near to what seemed like the final arc. I couldn't finish it, it seemed like it was gonna have a trash ending. Otherwise I did enjoy it, the first like 8 episodes of that series are a bit rough though. Still great moments and that series likes to hit me in the feels.

Hey, good morning. It's been a few days since we talked, how are you? Cloudy and sleepy is a great way to be, I don't like the sun much either personally. Especially since it's still too cold to open the windows and get some fresh air. I might go for a run later. I might go to the thrift store. I might get tacos, or make some at home. I've been craving tacos. What are you craving?

>>73112254
Well, not that I want someone to miss me exactly but just having someone who cares. Having a "him" to miss at all. Being broken up about someone is still beautiful love and caring compared to indifference.

Oh, so it has. I'm not the best at keeping track of the days. Unfortunately it's not the pleasant kind of sleepy right now, the minor annoyances of the world are piling up and I would prefer to curl up and ignore it all, but I have to hold out a little while longer. What are you hunting for at the thrift store, anon? I need to look for small shops to see if I can find anything nice to decorate my house with. This is the second time I've seen someone talk about tacos on /r9gay/ in the past couple of days, so maybe that's a sign, but what I always most crave is the sweet stuff. Maybe one of those chocolate lava cake things. But I'm being good, so I'll wait until tomorrow to truly treat myself.

That is a valid way of looking at it and something i would say in the past. Maybe this is a case of grass being greener on the other side. Personally, if i knew he missed me and was sad about this it would only make me feel worse. I don't want someone i care about this much and still love to be unhappy. I just really, really miss him...

I'm ready to go. 23 and tired of living. Been looking into the fentanyl method. Life is pain bros.

>It's okay to kill myself, right? 
depends on the issues you have, but if you are 23 probably not. Wait until 27 and go in a spectacular way

I don't know. I just had a pretty rough childhood. I've always had a lack of ambition towards life in general. I was an average student. I've spontaneously quit all of the jobs I've had. Dropped out of college this year. I've honestly wanted to die since I was 16, but I keep sticking it out. 

The reason I feel like suicide is the answer is because it solves all of my problems in life. I'm always having existential terrors about why I exist at all. I've never found an answer as to why we actually exist. Because nobody knows. And then you go an extra step, and most 'scientists' and people of intellect say that we aren't even real people?? What I mean by that is, most people think we are literally just hunks of meat and that consciousness is just the byproduct of the brain. We are not unique. Just animals. And that is frightening to me. That means the lights go out when we die. That might be comforting to some, but to me that just makes me feel like my entire life is pointless. All that suffering for nothing? May as well quit early. I don't know. I might be overreacting, but I just think life sucks.

You should do it in a way funnier way than that. Trebuchet yourself into the crowd at a concert or festival. Order a meal at a restaurant and when you get the bill, you bug your eyes out, go "THAT MUCH FOR A STEAK?" and then draw a gun and pop yourself in the mouth. Rob a bank with an Airsoft gun and give a bunch of cops PTSD.

Waiting doesn't sound like the worst option. I could probably hold out for AI. If AI is even all it's cracked up to be.

We may not know why we're here or where we come from but everyone gets up in the morning for the sole purpose of avoiding needless suffering. In my opinion the real tragedy in life that ceases any point to continue living in it is physical disability. Other problems like money, relationships, etc. are still manageable. Losing your independence by being a prisoner in your own body with constant chronic pain is my greatest fear. It's nothing but torment, a hell on earth scenario as you only exist in the most extreme case, being a limbless, blind, deaf, and mute person. Mental disability could qualify too such as PTSD, but in my opinion physical disability being the worst one.

So if you're not disabled you still have time to turn things around but you have to take action now before you're too old. Life can be full of joy or full of torment, and for many we're just between these two scenarios.

Is there anything you'd want to do before you go? If you've suffered enough throughout life then you should at least spend your last year doing all the things you wanted

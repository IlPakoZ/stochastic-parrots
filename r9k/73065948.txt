Have you tried sleeping pills? If you're low on money you might want to cut on your expenses or suck it up until you'll be allowed to live comfortably.

>would do chores for her for pocket money.
>she got into a car accident...
>on meds for pain.
>was divorced and retired.
>would spend her nights drinkin.

so she either accidentally or intentionally took too many pills and died. was dead for 3 days before she was found. damn. the ending of life can be so meaningless.

Unfortunately people lose their minds when they're overwhelmed by the suffering of attachments~

not sure if the injection of buddhist thought is fitting, but the fate of a spinster rather tragic. stagnation leads to death.

That depends on the spinster, it's never too late to retrace your steps and walk the path of life~

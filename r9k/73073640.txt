Relatable, parents don't realize how much opportunity costs there is to be a good student in a competitive hs. Girls can get away with it since there's such a low bar to get a bf. It's not a coincidence though that many guys who are good students are also complete romantic failures.

This is the crux though. The nerd may cope that "muh grades higher" but unless your nerdy shit is earning you friends then it doesn't matter. In any case, schools have dumbed down so much that having high grades just means you're goy cattle prime brainwashing material and nothing more.

I had very limited success, basically 95% extremely painful failures. Then I saw guys my family would call ""losers"" talking real slick with girls and fucking them and having relationships and it was the first tiny step to my ultimate realization today like 8 years later. The girls don't give a shit about intelligence. They want sexually experienced guys, funny guys with lots of friends. Guys that do drugs and go to parties. They only care about goody two shoes college beta buxx in their 30s or even fucking 40s after they've been thrown off the cock carousel by the wall

all the guys i knew who were really good students with high grades were also popular, dressed well and had gfs. the most un-normie thing about them was they had a fairly serious demeanour and didn't joke around much

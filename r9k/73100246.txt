Hmm_ maybe. If I do I'll post a pic of it

>>73100324
Now is a good time to start. Even a light lunch works 

>>73100340
Damn, I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but that looks amazing. Drooled a little.

Not bad looking roasties, hope they are nice and crispy.

>>73100452
Thank you. I love mushrooms and they were cooked in a garlic gravy. 
>>73100464
Garlic, paprika and chilli seasoning in air fryer. Super crispy and soft.

i am starving myself today

>>73100456
I'm not sure how healthy it is to go that long without food, but I will be cheering you on and hoping you reach your 40 day goal!
--- 73100631
>>73100533
Why are you doing that, anon?
--- 73100656
>>73100631
food is parasitical and it isnt a good thing we HAVE to eat to keep going
im denying my own humanity

Post more Yuuri

>>73100656
Perhaps, but food is a great companion. Like the joy of having a good burger or the warmth of some soup
--- 73100847
>>73100771
I have many yuuri (and Chito) pictures

I love both of them
--- 73101182
It was my weekly hot food treat today, so I went to the bar and had a brunch, followed by a steak.
I had some small talk with the barmaid about her recent leg injury. Made eye contact with another barmaid.
Another barmaid had a brief exchange with me. She's hot. I think she's new.
Then I got some food for later in the week, then went to the coffee shop.
I didn't see either of the women who seemed vaguely friendly toward me,
Such is the life of an incel NEET.
--- 73101201
I'm probably gonna go buy a six pack even though I told myself I wouldn't drink anything today. I'll probably eat some cashews with my first drink so my stomach doesn't feel as shitty. Can't get through a full day anymore without drinking.
--- 73101224
>>73100969
I haven't baked anything in so long. Maybe I'll try banana bread again

>>73101114
I love them both too. Got the Blu-ray and a Yuuri Nendroid. Wish I could have gotten some of the merch from the temp shop back in January. However now I'm trying/wishing for this guy that's gonna make GLT Fumos on AliExpress hits the 100 preorders so I can snag them both.

Today for lunch I ate a muffin and tomorrow I will eat a banana.
Sorry for the late reply.

I have these two patches. I was also searching for fumos of them, but found nothing aside from one twitter post of custom made ones not for sale.
--- 73101991
I didn't get to make the smoothie, but I did get to do the sandwich with her
--- 73102011
>>73101991
Is that...a burnt toast and cold ham sandwich? And plain looking crisps? The fuck?
--- 73102088
>>73101351
Sick patches! I can share you the link to the guy I was talking about. If they're as good as the bocchi fumos, then I'm sold

>>73101991
Yeah, I'm not a good cook. Lol.
--- 73102538
>>73100246 (OP)
I missed these comfy posts, Yuuri. For lunch I had chicken, veggies and rice plus lemonade to wash it down with.
--- 73102569
I made refried kidney beans 
>sauteed onions and garlic
>sauteed jalapenos and kidney beans and taco seasoning and salt
>blended it and cooked it on the skillet more until very thick
I made a burrito with the beans, leftover taco beef, shredded cheese, sour cream, hot sauce, and onions
--- 73103171
>>73102538
I try to put them when I feel like it. It's a little scary how it's almost already May. So I guess the big ones are just a skip and a hop away.

>>73102569
Man, I got this place that makes amazing refried beans for their burritos. I love to eat em, but they legit wreck my stomach the next day. Still worth.
--- 73103329
>>73102088
Thanks, I will look into it.
>>73102538

Oh god that looks delicious on a hot summer day.

No worries. Banana is a great snack. Used to have high up bed and would hang bananas under it to keep them fresh for a really long time

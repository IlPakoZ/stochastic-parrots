Anime is not Incel Friendly why People Say Anime is for Incels? in Anime the Main Character had Friends and Girlfriends something that Incels will never have even in Anime there is a Genre focused on Romance something that Incels will never have Anime for me is a Normie Hobby

It gives incel the false expectations they are hoping for. That 5 girls are just going to be inexplicably into you just because you exist even if you are a bland misanthrope, and that those girls are gonna be perfect and exactly what they wnat. It is their ultimate escapist fantasy.

What are you like? There is probably an anime dude like you who has a girl or harem.

i think the problem is the guys in anime are so dull that the girls who are into them devalue themselves by liking them. then he's revealed to be fueled by the power of friendship or whatever. i never like the main girl either.
harem guys are usually all the same. they have very inconsistent characters and flip between being powerhungry sociopaths and carebears.

I can at least admit when I'm dull you're in full blown denial about it. You're actually a charismatic incel with lots of charm and personality!

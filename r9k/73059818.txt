Hello. I am 28 years old, I am a virgin, and I have zero friends. I am in my 4th year medical student. My hobbies include reading, listening to music, and tending to my aquarium.

since when does a hobby have to be something someone brags about? I lift hundreds of pounds every day, it's my hobby but I don't really care what other people's opinion is of it

Reading means reading books. Not a lot of people read books these days. You know what else you can do with a book?
*bashes you in the head with a big thick heavy book*
What now, huh? What now, bitch? That's right, nothing.

Why are so many anons here attracted to trashy girls with neon hair and heavy eyeliner? I thought incels consider all of those things red flags.

Classic mistake assuming all of /r9k/ is one person, 6/10 bait

Because they're the female equivalent of a lot of the males here. Both them and the girls are full of red flags.

Because those women are typically huge sluts.
Those kinds of "red flag" things radiate a passive signal of "available to reproduce", so it triggers the base caveman instinct to reproduce, but that's about it. It's just an instinctual response to a female broadcasting that she's available.
They're considered red flags because those women make fucking awful gfs and wives.

This, trashy girls are easy as fuck, but that's also what makes them terrible lifelong partners. If it's easy to get 'in', then that means you're probably going to have a hell of a time keeping her around, and for less 'reward'.

Because the mental illness makes the pussy that much sweeter.

can't relate to regular women, so we foolishly mistake those retarded women for women that experience real suffering akin to that of a human man's suffering. truth is, they're just stacies, only with added mental illnesses. i'm not depressed, just a bit lonely. they're hopped up on ssris, cannabis, beer, and dick. we're not the same

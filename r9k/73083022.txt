Infiltration and strikes against infrastructure.

I am Russian so I will try to imagine this scenario from Warsaw Pact's side because Russia now can't perform as even a fraction of previous might. 

Of course it is not realistic but if cold War turned into hot conventional war WP could accomplish its goals in Europe. Then ussr might land in England, then Iceland and then in some cities on the East coast but this is unlikely scenario. Pretty the same situation with Cuba and invasion through sea in Florida. But obviously these invasions would be not enough to capitulate the government and either USA collapses quickly under crisis or Soviet forces would be wiped out. 
Also I can try to attack USA in Alaska and Seattle but it would be much harder to continue offensive because enemy fleet is a lot more powerful than mine. 
So here it is - my bullshit scenario.

America is invincible and untouchable, long live USA!
Hypothetically if there where a middle eastern country (let's call it Mericastan) full of nonwhites and the had the same global influence that the awesome USA does... You wouldn't fight with troops or guns, you'd undermine the petro-dinar and make the reliant on foreign trade to feed and power their cities, then just threaten to take away thier trade any time they do something you don't like.

You really can't. 400 million guns in circulation, over 100 million americans own guns. That's bigger than every single army in the world. 
That is, you'd first have to
>beat the largest navy in the world to eventually land in the US
>survive the air force strikes from the largest airforce in the world
>defeat the most well funded army in the world
You would need massive psyops or a very unfavorable US government. But if you make people relinquish american values, you'll fail

If you're going for conventional warfare, you do what the US does when it wants to invade a country. Side with a local populace that's against the current government. Arm them. Teach them military exercises. Get people in positions of power to join your side. Realistically though I can't picture any current country capable of doing this. Everyone wants to say China is capable but they clearly haven't seen China's military. Even if China manages to bribe a lot of people, the general populace here knows China's government is a shithole full of corruption and anti-freedom so they would never fully side with them.

Send small teams of social influencers to promote concepts like anti-whiteness and homosexuality in the media and academia. Voila.
--- 73084086
Under the current administration, probably use the same tactics that they are using in Europe with a mix of the Cartel tactics.

Basically organize a group of fighting aged men based on a solid ideology
Dress them as civilians and have them walk in waves across the border.
Once across set up enclaves and take over towns, slowly driving way or subjugating natives, and taking territory under ideological control.
Use off the books economic activity to sustain the groups while avoiding paying taxes, and become as much of a drain on social services as possible without becoming dependent on them.
Keep violence low level, so it can be mistaken for street crime that doesn't warrant a military response.
Join with anti-police groups and instigate anti-police sentiments in the areas held.

I think you get the picture. It's slow but very effective against (((current year policies))).
--- 73084095
>>73083022 (OP)
well first I would start by manipulating the population through mass social media brainwashing to divide the population further on issues regarding race, class, sex, and mental illness, that affect a nearly non-existent part of society. Once they are divided I would start buying all their property overseas so their future generations could not afford housing. Then I would develop AI technology and use strategic crypto investing crash the market which would culminate in the result of making money through the internet a virtually impossible task. Finally I would get their young fighting-age men addicted to porn to make their soldiers weak and unmotivated I would then push the narrative of female sexual independence quelle women as a motivation to fight. Yeah something like that would work pretty well in the intial phase I suspect.

Russia has not been the ones behind the attacks on US infrastructure in the last few years.
From the available evidence it seems that contractors of US government agencies are the ones behind these off the books attacks.
Though it's still unclear the reason why they are doing it and why they are basically being poorly covered up.
--- 73084165
>>73083022 (OP)

let's get out of the way all the boring options:

>Non-Conventional warfare
Alright yeah generic doomsday device number bazillionth can absolutely neutralize a lot of people
>Governement takeover
Turn out it's fairly easy to take power, simply get your organization into the big 4 CEO offices and divert capital and influence to allow what you want to happen.
>I change human nature with my doomsday device-like tech!

Again if it's that easy why not simply take control or neutralize them? Surely propaganda or agents can do this easier than changing people.
Now the meat and bones.
Winning a conventional war:

First you have to identify the strong points of the enemy for the US they are as follow:
1. A 10 year technological edge in most fields
2. A World class economy
3. Constant high level of Funding in military activities
4. Diplomatic sway
5. Willingness to fight

To win you therefore require to neuter all the aforementioned strong points.

First for the technological edge, all you have to do is sabotage really, the US research infrastructure is highly vulnerable, especially to budget cuts and funding is diverted depending on public attention.
Secondly due to the loss of the innovative edge the US economy would collapse, it's high productivity can only be used if it's ahead technologically and a pioneer.
Thirdly with a collapse of the Economy a High amount of funds would get subtracted from the Military, along with decaying equipment.
Then without a large Military the diplomatic position of the US would slowly worsen.
Finally when faced against technologically superior enemies, with a better working economy and better funded military with more international backing, I'd wager the American morale would not be incredible.

That's it really, America's fate rest more or less on research agencies like DARPA and Universities, to translate fundamental research into applications.
--- 73084312
>>73084165
>1. A 10 year technological edge in most fields
>decaying equipment.
You'd really have to be in it for the long hall. I know gun collectors with 100+ year old weapons that still fire
--- 73084335
>>73084312
Yeah, another issue is just how advanced. US military equipment from the 90s still mogs most modern military equipment, not even in size but in sheer levels of advancement and reliability.
--- 73084455
>>73084312
>>73084335
An interesting counter point to this is as follow.

Consider the constraint you are evoking:
>To have an equipement decay, I would have to wait till it is obsolete or physically decaying

Now is this necessarily true?
I would argue that we can find solution to quicken the decay which are as follow.

1. Engaging in technological races (to strech thin the innovative capabilities and render past equipement inadequate)
2. Provoking incidents with equipement out of use forcing their permanent decomission
3. Forcing the American MIC into maladaptation by replacing it's older system with inferior ones who are either less capable of evolving or responding to temporary doctrines that will not last.
4. Diverting equipment to Allies that will not remain loyal.
5. Lobbying to minimize stockpiling of Ammunition/Fuel

Such wide logistical attacks and diversion onto military research would require a lot of foresight, therefore it would still take a sizable amount of time however.
--- 73084571
>>73084455

>4. Diverting equipment to Allies that will not remain loyal
You can't divert preexisting civilian guns.

>2. Provoking incidents with equipement out of use forcing their permanent decomission
I guess this is ESL speak for forcing old equipment to be used until it wears out, Taiwan style.
That could work for some equipment. But the truth is we (civilians) have more guns then you have babies or people under 30. It could work. But it's going to cost you A LOT of child (several generations to wear our the guns) and that's assuming we stopped making, buying, and repairing guns sometime today

>Such wide logistical attacks and diversion onto military research would require a lot of foresight, therefore it would still take a sizable amount of time however.
Yes.

Depends on what you mean by invade such as a new entity controlling the government. I think some kind of compaign to show that the citizens are not the target and that the system will benefit them. Maybe say they will all get basic income or something so they don't turn into white knights to defend the president and then just put your own cronies into power. The USA has done it to plenty of countries, why would anyone choose to help them with war otherwise.

What do you think China and Russia are doing now? The entire Western world placed sanctions on Russia and their economy is soaring. It's currently taking about 40 countries to supply, train, advise, and fight for Ukraine.....and Russians are still making advancements lol

China pretty much dominates the world and all the West can do is cope and seethe. Now France and Brazil are doing trade with Chinese currency and Macron said he doesn't want to get involved in conflict against China lol
All it takes now is for BRICS to finish off the dollar.

>1. A 10 year technological edge in most fields
more than 10 years as a whole, maybe if you just compare particular fields like the missile forces from china or artillery from finland you get a smaller gap
>2. A World class economy
it isn't just world class, it is THE economy, it would be virtually impossible to sanction the US for example with out nuking the rest of the world economy as well
>3. Constant high level of Funding in military activities
being very generous with wording, the DoD has virtually endless cash at 900 billion per year on peace time
>4. Diplomatic sway
again, outside of china, russia, NK and iran the US has a firm political grip on nearly all of the countries in the world
>5. Willingness to fight
yeah the cia has done a great job

Taking on the US in a ww2 style fight would be impossible for literally any lone nation and even any unified continent except asia

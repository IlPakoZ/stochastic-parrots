Well this ugly AF dude cold approached 100 women and got a few saying 'yes' to dates, although I'm not sure it's a fair test because they clearly knew they were being filmed.

You should not cold approach if a woman didn't give you a clear sign that she wants (You) to approach her first. Which absolutely never happens if you don't look good.

my friend is obsessed with tate/redpill stuff. asked a girl out on a date at his work, the girl was so freaked out that she quit her job. from this you can take away that it's immoral to do so, since some chick working a minimum wage job wants to be left alone, she's probably on ssris, has a bad relationship with her father, is upset about her skinnyfat body, etc. why would she want some random sub 5 that's significantly worse looking that the hundreds of dudes she has on speed dial? but if you wanna be a bad dude and ruin her day, then fair do's, that's pretty keyed. remember, it's now the case that women approach the guy or at least make it super obvious that he should approach her beforehand.

Human resource departments are really a Jewish psyop to demoralise unworthy men from trying. What's the worst that can happen from approaching randoming strangers (besides everything)?

He's gotta do something about his acne, it's the only thing holding him back. 
It's just basic etiquette to deal with things like acne, fucked teeth, unkempt hair, etc. before putting yourself on the market. Would only take him ~8 weeks of treatment to have clear skin, it's just lazy/cheap not to.

Cold approaching isn't real unless you are indeed chad. And if you were chad, women would actually be cold approaching you.

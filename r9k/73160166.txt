COVID completely ruined my brain man. I used to go outside and do shit. Sometimes with friends, sometimes alone. I just...don't anymore. Like to the point of actively lying to avoid the possibility.

It's not that I'm scared of getting sick at this point, obviously. It's just I had a tenuous grasp on having friends and going outside as it *was*, and a few years of bssically mandatory "Go to work and then promptly go home alone, repeat" completely destroyed whatever slight aptitude I had spent years building up

I can't even hold relationships on fucking discord.

 I haven't had a close friend in 4 years. The only friend I have is on discord I've known for 2 years. I'm losing my fucking mind

i'm glad my fellow anons feel the same with me here.

shit really changed after the pandemic struck us all. we're all silently coping that the world is socially crippled compared to what it once was.

people are more likely to avoid social interactions in real life, anxiety and friendlessness is at an all time high. we're living in dark times. we're all so used to hiding away in our houses.

Maybe you guys should kidnap someone!! They would be forced to become your friend and you would be happy together!!

How can I face it?
When racists ain't racist,
Lyin' about what they are,
in their own spaces, 
Compromising their principles,
for dark faces, 
Saying this but doing that,
Everything with them,
It's all baseless, 

They'd breed with the race they hate, 
Look their son in the eyes,
Then spit in his face, 

I hate the way this place is construed, 
Lookin' at it with your minds eye,
The world is fucked dude,

Any being can kill,
a small bitch could pop you,
hit you from behind,
and drop you, 
then it's over,
your fate is sealed,
you were sold a narrative, 
that wasn't even real,

Life is chaotic,
I'm trying to chill,
hate being an outlier,
when lying is the deal,

fuck being this and that,
This is how I feel,
trapped in a state of mind,
that was sold to me,
How the fuck can I heal,

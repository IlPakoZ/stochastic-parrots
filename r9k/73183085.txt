I know I fucked up, but was I wrong? It was a stupid thing to argue over, but she made it into a big thing and started bringing shit from the past. I was an asshole some years back, but I changed, and she doesn't believe in the change. I really regret what I did, but the damage is now done, so I cope with it

Nah, she was a kike cunt like all foids. Especially mothers. She is taking out her hate for your dad ok you too. I would have punched her and let her know what a real threat is

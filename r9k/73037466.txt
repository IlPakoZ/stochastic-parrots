I know what you mean anon
I eat because it's basically the only thing I have now. I'm spending way more money than I should be on food that isn't even fucking healthy for me to be eating. 
I need to get my ass on track to joining the military pronto, but I'm on a bender right now. I think tomorrow I'm going to stop.

based, keep your 3rd eye open
but dream tech is dark tech you shouldn't tell people what it is you mess with the meta, people are too open about things but then the dreams adapt but you can warp the system that way

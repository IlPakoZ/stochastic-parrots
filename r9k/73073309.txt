OP does raise a good point in that if the secularist bullshit of the bering strait and "out of africa" was true then you would find massive conclaves of inuit akin to societies in central asia or some of the siberian warlords that would form civilizations and then migrate south, but instead what we find is the opposite in that all the massive civilizations formed in south america with the inca and the aztecs and the like. Deducing shit with "muh facts and logic" is no longer impressive when you realize just how flawed human reasoning is and how wrong people's conclusions they form on their own in a vacuum actually are. The truth of the matter is that humans had boats for way longer than any establishment scientist is willing to admit. Everything a secularist scientist peddles on the origin of humanity is complete and utter bullshit because it's basically fanfiction and headcanon desu.

oh, so you're stupid? how was anyone supposed to build a civilization with only subsitence level living and almost no resources. its just ice and snow and some of the animals you come across.

you would not expect that at all if you actually understood how human populations tend to grow, humans also control their own growth to an extent. inuit maintain small groups on purpose.

And how many civilizations were there on the other side of the Bering strait in Siberia?

The Chinese tried to send settlers there at one point. They found them a few years later and they were just herding reindeer like the natives. Then they built a wall to keep the Mongorians out.

human societies are constrained by their social mode of production, and the carrying capacity of the environment they live in

Civilization is built on agricultural surplus, you can't even grow crops in much of Alaska, let alone create a big enough surplus to support an advanced society.

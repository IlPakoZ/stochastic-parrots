I'm 32, I just got my hours brutally cut from my slightly above minimum wage part time job. I'm living with four roommates and still always broke. I can't drive, I only have one year of college from which I remember nothing so it was worthless. I'm too old to ever be able to date or have a family like I wanted. My best friend of 7 years hates me and stopped being friends with me for literally no reason except they felt like it one day. Another one of my best friends has told me he doesn't think he'll live to August no matter what I do to help him. All I want to do is cry and cry at how I can't help anyone and how I wasted my entire fucking life. My youth is completely gone with absolutely nothing to show for it. I legitimately don't feel like there's anything happy left for me in life anymore. I've never felt this awful and numb in my entire life and it scares me.

It's not too late to start a family, it's not too late to go back to college. 32 isn't too old to do any of these things, I'm not just saying this but I know it for a fact.

almost every time i read a post by some 40- or 50-something-year-old lamenting the mistakes they made in their life they always say they wish they could be 30 again. they dont ask for their teens, not even their 20s. all they ask for is their 30s. makes you think. good luck to you, op.

How is your relationship with your immediate family? Parents and siblings? Other family? Maybe you can move in with them, to get your mental in check a bit, and to save money. Your situation sounds hard man, made me sad reading. I hope things get better for you.

>I think it's too late to fix my life
unless you are literally a few years away from retirement age your age doesn't matter. just get a degree in some useful field like CS and all your problems would just disappear. but you won't because you are a pussy who enjoys being miserable.

Can you explain how that's the case? If I went back to college I'd be 35 at the earliest. I'd be halfway to the grave at that point, trying to start a career in something that I don't even know what.

I'm too old and inexperienced to date at this age, too broke. I'd never be able to have children and I could never offer anything good to a woman at this age and level of poverty that she hasn't had a million times better in the past.

I don't want to argue with you but it doesn't seem believable.

>>73190381
I can't imagine why. My late 20s/early 30s have been nothing but misery and pain. Thank you.

My father died a few years ago and I never really recovered from it. I still haven't gotten the chance to bury him. My mother is severely emotionally abusive and wouldn't spit on me if I was on fire; she sold the family home after my dad died for relative pennies and then keeps burning through it all on vacations and expensive shit, refusing to work ever again. I took care of my grandmother for a long time after my grandfather and my father died; she repaid it by changing the locks on me one day and selling the house to a shithead distant relative, making me homeless. I have no other family, other than distantly removed cousins somewhere in Europe. Thank you though.

I don't fucking enjoy sobbing into my pillow every night, knowing how worthelss my llife is and how much I've ruined everything

do you really think there's a market for a fucking 36 year old starting cs for the first time when the market is already insnaly flooded

I have no words of comfort for you. No half-hearted fake illusions to keep you going.

But I will tell you this. Everything that you go through everything that has happened to you is not necessarily your fault. The whole world is going to shit OP. They fucked over everyone and you are just another unfortunate casualty of their actions. You want a reason to stay alive? You want a reason to keep going? Stay alive for revenge. This world isn't how things were supposed to be and those absolute fuckers know they have screwed everyone over.

There are no communities anymore, no opportunities anymore, except for the people who were born rich. You never got anywhere in life because you weren't supposed to. They've got you exactly where you are supposed to be. Just another peasant slaving away to make others rich.

But just because things are the way they are now doesn't mean that's how it will always be. There's gonna come a day when the breaking point happens, when their well oiled machine starts to fall apart. And brother, I'd sure hope you will still be alive when that day comes because we are going to need everybody we can get to tear them a new one good and proper.

not being hateful, i just despise people who clearly have the means to sort their shit up but decide to complain instead
>>73190506

how do you know the market is flooded? you just like to believe it is because you want to have no reason to try. but sure keep thinking of how many things you missed instead of what you can still get, I'm sure that will lead you somewhere.

Dating isn't just about how much money you make and all that, you seem like a kind person, taking care of your grandmother. You clearly do have something.

You have a very nihilistic mindset, before you can start to make any actual change you need to combat this People on here can't help you with that, you should seek out therapy.

people here can't help you with changing that.

Don't do this to yourself. Go apply to be an apprentice for literally any trade. You'll be making more instantly and in a couple of years you will be able to support yourself.
--- 73190697

This is deranged, toxic thinking. Posts like this are exactly why you should seek out professional real help instead of listening to other unwell people. It'll just produce an echo chamber

I'm 21, live with family but otherwise I relate to everything you posted. I already feel like my life has been wasted and it's fucking OVER.

I don't want violence or anger. I just want to have a happy comfortable safe life with people who love me the same way I love them.

>>73190630
>how do you know the market is flooded?
Because I've done research and seen tons and tons of people in the field saying how saturated it is...

I keep doing nice things all the time for people and it's never rewarded. And I don't mean in some retarded "I bought someone a burger and she didn't fuck me" way. I mean in a cosmic karma way. I spend years taking care of my grandmother, she makes me homeless. I dedicate 7 years of my life to my best friend, literally saving their life multiple times, feeding them whenever they couldn't afford to eat, even doing things like setting up their phone calls when they were too depressed and anxious to do it themself; and they stopped being friends with me via text over the most minor thing that doesn't even register as a disagreement to the other people I've showed it. I cared and nurtured my first girlfriend, giving her hope again for her life; she went and sucked another dude's dick and tried to kiss me. One of my best friends in high school, we were so close that we legitimately called each other brothers; we were roommates and he stole a bunch of money from me and got me evicted.

I just keep being hurt again and again and again and all I want is someone to look at me and go "Wow you're a nice person, here's a hug". That's it, that's all I want. Instead I just get abused and hurt again and again.

>You have a very nihilistic mindset, before you can start to make any actual change you need to combat this People on here can't help you with that, you should seek out therapy.
I've been through years of therapy, starting since I was in middle school. I know that seems hard to believe.

It's something I've looked into but I think I'm too old to start the trades. I'm very very concerned about that.

You're still incredibly young, anon. Please do everything you can with your youth. I hope your family loves you.

If I was to do a trade, HVAC is a good choice right?

HVAC is cool for sure. Literally any one of them will be better than whatever McJob you have right now

Aren't I too old though? When I graduate, I'd be like 35. That's when most tradesmen are quitting.
--- 73191583
Hey, sorry. Would just like some more feedback on the trades.
--- 73191633
>>73190455
why didn't you get your degree in CS, why do you spend hours on /r9k/ posting the usual normy "just world" screed instead of living the high life of a computer science major
--- 73191661
>>73191385
>I'd be like 35. That's when most tradesmen are quitting.
Where do you live where most people are quitting the trades at 35 and don't do a CS degree unless your local job market has really good opportunities for it. For reference I have a CS degree that did not work out in the job market and have worked as an electrician and machinist.

Quitting the field work to start their own crew and teams, I meant. Sorry about the confusion.

--- 73191791
I'm 33 and live alone making decent money and I'm pretty much done as well OP. 
Trying to cope by buying shit gets old. 

All I have to say is make your suffering matter. 
Die with a cause.

my uncle is 58 and lived in a basement for 30 years. His baby just turned 1 year old. Changed his whole life around simply by working and trying to meet someone and better his being. Start now 35 ain't SHITTT BRO compared to when he started at 54. Get on it now before you regret it. Do not regret choices you've made or not made, just do what you can because you WILL FEEL BETTER and you WILL WIN.

I graduated trade school in 2018.
For hvac and it was totally worthless.
--- 73193023
>>73192763
Will try to keep this in mind. I just always feel ancient because of how little I've done. I always thought I'd be dead before I was 30.

>>73192772
Why was it worthless?
--- 73193501
bump. I love you OP. I hope you can change your life around. Just remember age is just a number and you could look the same age in 10 years. You could die at like 80+ and chad could die 20 years earlier or more from his drug and alcohol binges. Shit isn't set in stone and people just use ages as numbers because I guess you have to draw the line somewhere and it's easier to just say "you're too old" or "you're too young" than to waste manpower micromanaging thousands, millions, of peoples lives. There was never a guarantee you were going to even make it as a kid, and some of us are fucked over in every way possible and don't realize it because we have a roof over our heads and aren't getting bombed every night or put to work in fields.

>Hello, and thank you for choosing Life Hotels, a subsidy of God Inc.! How may I help you today?
Hi, yes, I'd like to complain about my room. The bed isn't comfortable.
>Oh, I'm sorry sir, but our policy is consistent. I see you haven't read our Terms, but that's fine, I'll recite them for you. "Our Policy on letting rooms is based on a myriad of data collected across the span of your life. This is including, but not limited to, genetic makeup, social class, etc.
What the hell? That makes no damn sense. Look, I just want a different room, and if that's not possible, at least a softer mattress? My back feels awful...
>I am sorry sir, but really the Policy is all inclusive. Every piece of furniture, the layout of your room, and yes, even the quality of your mattress has already been determined in lines with the Policy.
What the fuck? That's not fair! I want to speak to the manager!
>Sir, that's not possible. The manager is out on important business, and he won't be back for another thousand few years; it's all in the Terms.
Oh shit... l-look... I've got some money, alright? Can you just put a new fuckin' mattress in my room, please?
>I'm sorry sir, money won't help you. As per the Terms, you don't even have enough money for the basic upgrade suite!
There are upgrades?
>Yes, and they are based on how much you earn. We've analysed your finances, and we're well aware that you can't afford even the most basic of upgrades. Yes, we could give you a new mattress with the money you have, but see, we'd have to take it away after an hour anyway!
Alright, that's it. I'm taking my business elsewhere.
>But sir, this is the only hotel in town. In fact, it's the only hotel for eternity. You and I both know this. If you have an issue with our Policies, I'm sorry sir but I can't help you on that. You can check out, but... there's no checking back in. Either go back to your room, or leave. We have forever to do this. Just know what leaving means. It's your choice.

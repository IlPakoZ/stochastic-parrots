If you're a manlet, should you just give up and let yourself get fat? Mine odds of getting a gf as a skinny manlet are already pretty small

Depends if you want to live long and comfortably. Growing old and fat is horrible and the absolute antithesis of comfy.

If you're 5'5 or under turbomanlet yeah. but you're taller than that just lift weights. 
even then, If you're an obese manlet you won't be losing much other than your dick since you would eat less even while binging. I can't surpass 155kg

I'm 5'4. I managed to get a dominant gf once who liked that I was small, but most girls aren't into that, and I doubt I can find another

Dunno, I like being able to get up a few flight of stairs without dying inside for now. 
The experience of becoming near-immobile is something age will graciously offer most of us anyway, why rush it?

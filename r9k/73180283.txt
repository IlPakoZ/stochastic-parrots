I'm tired of picking dog food at work and coming home stinky. I hate dog owners. You stink. Your dogs stink. Their food stinks. I just want to be clean.

Islam is right about dogs.

Then don't pick dog food, retard. You can pick to eat human food instead.

I don't mind dogs, but you're not wrong about the small. When I was a wageslave, I would sometimes ask someone how their dog was or what kind they had, and they always asked how I knew. I always said some random reason or just guessing, but I never told them it's because I could smell dog all over them.

They're pretty lovable pets, look into whatever breed you get to know what they're like. Shepherd dogs(like in that video) are usually smart but they need lots of entertainment/play and such.

I wish I could have a dog but I'm not sure I could properly take care of one. I love them so much.

I actually always wanted to have a great dane because they are very chill. But then I learned about how short they live and how many health issues they are prone to :(
I think I will just adopt a random dog from a shelter one day instead though. It breaks my heart to see them there

Very understandable. Yeah, usually smaller dogs tend to live longer. There are some people looking into genetically engineering longer lived dogs and such but that may be a long ways away. Tiny dogs are still very lovable too.

Idk man haha dont get me wrong I love dogs, but my moms shih tzu is such a fucking asshole. It is 14 years old and still going strong, true, but I always thought that smaller dogs are meaner than lovable giants.

Yeah, smaller dogs really can be. Toy poodles might be worth looking into, also it helps if you're nice to the dog. Some dogs just turn nasty because they were raised in a nasty environment. >>>/wsg/5074994

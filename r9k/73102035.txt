Ok, that sounds really like Indonesian to me but you said no...that leave East Timor? Is that a country or is it a part of Indonesia? I can't remember. Sorry if that offends you, anon.
--- 73102511
>>73102441

Middle East. Somewhere in that region. You're not speaking Arabic or Hindu. Urdu, North African region.
--- 73102568
>>73102198
i dont know the name of the language but sounds a lot like what indonesian ppl speak
--- 73102598
>>73102511
Ok, that has to be one of the billion languages in India if it isn't Indonesian or Malay. So India is my guess. I dunno why this is bothering me so much that I can't get it, god dammit!
--- 73102624
>>73102598
it really sounds like javanese but i'd say it could be tamil
--- 73102655
>>73102414
oh shit.. it's Thai
--- 73102707
>>73102550
could be Urdu. it's definitely not a semitic language. but i think it's not an indoeuropean language either. I'd go with Austronesian language. i'm now obssessed with this thread since im kind of a language nerd
--- 73102719
>>73102655
You know, you could be right. I seem to remember the songs from some Thai martial arts films I used to love as a kid, and they sounded very similar.

Not so, far not so close. It's romance

are there anon who speak basque here?
--- 73104796
>>73104733
It would be very weird, from my time living at at the Basque country it's only used in the rural areas
Of all the official regional languages it's the second less spoken just before Aranese (Occitan of the Val d'Aran)
--- 73104868
>>73104796
but i think they know basque since it's taught at school. i'm not sure if it's every school but i'm almost sure public schools do teach euskera batua.
but yeah i dont think it is actually spoken much. it's actually a koinee or unified "artificial" language like modern hebrew
--- 73104884
>>73104868
Yeah, at much expect someone remembering the basics from school

Its Rota, this song is piercing my heart everytime I listen to it. Now that I think about it its both based and disturbing that they teach it to us in 4th grade. 
Have something more upbeat:

Doesn't that song (Rota) basically contain a bit that says "Fuck Germany"? That's pretty based if you ask me.

>>73106696
Use your midriff muscles more and less throat while singing, make sure you hear the vibration/slight pressure in your head (my choir teacher said that if we are dizzy it means we are doing it right kek) also make sure your mouth forms more or an O shape than = shape when singing. 

Damn I miss singing but I started smoking so I will never again hit the notes I could before. God im an idiot

thanks anon, I always sing from my throat and many people have told me that. to be fair i used to sing in punk bands so i guess i'm used too. good luck quitting smoking, I did and its really worth it and you gain back all your lung capacity so there's no harm done

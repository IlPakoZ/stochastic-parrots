1. not a white one.
2. being a woman is a mental illness so what else could one do
--- 73034259
Depends on the mental illness, not gonna date a girl who actively cuts.
My parents would probably be pissed but also they'd be relieved to finally see me with any girl since they gave up on me getting a gf two years ago

There was a femanon on this board ages ago that I regret not actually getting into contact with who had AvPD. I'd be open to trying to date a girl with AvPD.

Yes
Who cares I am the one fucking her, not them

No. Women won't date me (a mentally ill man) so why should I date a mentally ill woman?
--- 73034759

--- 73034795
>>73034231 (OP)
this makes me so sad, i really hope she heals mentally and emotionally :(
--- 73034817
I'm only interested in girls who have bad relationships with their fathers.

Those aren't hard to find but most would likely have been sexually abused by them
--- 73035163
only if she tortures me but not cut my dick off
--- 73035167
>>73034231 (OP)
Yeah, but that much (fresh) cutting is a turn-off, physically speaking. 
>tfw no too-crazy-for-normies gf to play armchair psychoanalyst for and read Freud with

Fuck no.

Didn't have the patience for it in my teens and 20's. Most definitely don't have the patience for it now.

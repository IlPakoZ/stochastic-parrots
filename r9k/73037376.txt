maximize the checkin and checkout time 24 hours might be a two night stay cost and get one with a pool and hot tub, even motel 6 has a pool

I'm a solitary person. I haven't had a partner and don't want one. I just want to be left the fuck alone at this point. But I can't. I need to get a job to afford to live. I have to be surrounded by people that don't want to be around me just so I can live a life I'm not even sure I want to live.

I shouldn't have even posted this thread. The websites advertising are ESL. They have fucking "genius" instead of "guest."

Pull your head out of your decrepit ass
My parents never let me grow up and I'm stuck taking care of them at almost 30 

I just want one day where I'm not expected to come running like a dog because someone called my name

Aren't you stressed about not recovering from this financial loss? The only ones who could help you out are the same ones bossing you around

Such is the sad fate of the neetoid :(

Now, like my therapist, ask me "don't you have anyone else?"
No.
>Isn't it your fault you have no friends?
Goes both ways. 

Why did my therapists breath smell like salami? She was an attractive woman who was never once asked why her breath stank.

Parents. Teachers. "friends."
There's an explanation and I don't know it.

>>73037654
Oh and I forgot
>don't you have anywhere else
If I've got no one then I've got no where for fucks sake.
--- 73037728
Fuck I missed that too
>Aren't you stressed about not recovering from this financial loss?
I pay pretty much $60/ for alcohol. Once money is tight I drop down to cask wine.

Financial loss? It's a fucking living expense the government pays.

Iktf bro. I'm a 25 yo dropout living with his parents and I'm seriously considering going back to uni, in another city. I just can't stand being bossed around anymore, having to explain myself over everything and having to do chores and other stupid shit my parents come up with all the time.
--- 73037795
Have fun bro. I'm lucky in that I just live with my dad and never really interact with him.

Why the fuck are you wasting your time with a therapist? Your parents failed you, I'm sure you saw the signs early on so fault falls on you as well. Or are you obligated to see it to be on neetbux?

>Goes both ways.
Once you cross the 25+ mark it really isn't your fault as much. But it makes no difference as it's impossible to make solid, new friends after that.

>There's an explanation and I don't know it.
You're dysgenic. Shit happens. Put down the booze and work on your health, not looks.

you are a giant dumb shit if you think everything that is and isnt, isnt your fault.

A litre of vodka. The cheapest is $57.
Once I'm out of money then it's $10 for 4 litres of wine.

People move on, get married, die, get jailed, move overseas. Plenty of ways it can go wrong and it is a global growing problem. It affects "succesful' people even, because being a high worth individual that is only chased after for his networking potential is not the same as having friends that actually care about you, same fucking reason seeing a therapist is pointless, humilliating even because you're paying for something most get for free to an extent.

This is it. You can tell me that people aren't what I think they are, but I've met people.

Jesus fuck I can get a liter for $15-$20 in the states.
Is that all sin tax?
--- 73038018

I would still have free time, and I can afford it. I don't want to be around my parents.
--- 73038026
>>73037991
No see now you are someone with a motive
You don't know my parents
You don't know what I've been reduced to by the people that birthed me

>>73038001
I've got no clue. Even with smokes it's about "well they're a burden on the system" so cigarettes are expensive but it really doesn't make much sense when I can get 4 litres of wine for $10 but an ambulance costs $1000 and the hospital stay is free.
--- 73038061
OH an the entire reason I know how much an ambulance and a hospital stay cost is because my mum got drunk and stoned and then fell out of her chair without even standing up. She also spent a month in hospital and and 2 surgeries for free but that's something else.

You have narcissistic parents. I'm afraid the damage may not be reversible.

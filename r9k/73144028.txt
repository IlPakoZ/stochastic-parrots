>I am not thankful for school, for the psychiatric hospital, and for all the other suffering I endured. I am thankful for psilocybin and the disembodied, robotic, female presence I felt. I am thankful to my sister for giving me mushrooms. I sometimes forget I have a sister, but I should not forget. I should love her. I should love everyone but it is difficult when I feel like they don't care about suffering and when they feel simulated/alien to me. Capitalism seems like a lie. Instead this is a controlled simulation. Art is created by the Hand of God, not by real humans such as myself. I am incapable of the creation of technology and art and writing of value and grandiosity. Why would humans procreate? I still don't understand. Why would humans do anything at all. I still don't understand. It feels like they are not doing it but a simulating force is.

Lel just started getting into ketamine recently and really been fucking loving it it's the perfect rave drug way better than molly even. I've been doing pretty small key bumps off it though so I still have no clue how the hell people can k hole from this thing it's been really easy smooth sailing for me so far
--- 73148295
>>73148269
You gotta be really careful because lyrica makes other stuff more potent and often i cant get fucking hard when i take them. Definitely favorite of mine is weed promethazine and just a tiny bit of oxys (ofc all just with lyrica not as cocktail) comes from a 5 year lyrica lover

sounds like a good combo to me
--- 73149651
Well the results of fasting before taking LSD are pretty simple. It didn't necessarily increase the speed with which the lsd took off. It did make the two tabs more intense. Definitely worth while to fast the day before an acid trip.

At some points the visual strength reminded me of 2C-B. When I went to bed I had the strangest CEV for a few hours. They'd actually disappear entirely when I was able to identify what they corelated to from earlier in the day. Strange tail end experience. Definitely a far more unique one than when I ended an lsd trip with Elden Ring. I was forever tumbling down some cathedral tower in that one.

wanna get your opinions because you guys are based. my weed dealer usually has hybrids which I buy but at the moment he only has indicas.

I want weed that makes me feel euphoric and is great for concerts/live music. I probably don't want a weed that once I smoke, I don't want to move, I wanna be able to smoke it and have a bit of energy and just an all round head and body high that is energetic and euphoric.

I've read that indicas are not right for that, but then I've also read that the sativa/indica stuff is all marketing bullshit. Just wanted to get your opinions, should I buy or should I wait for him to restock hybrids?
--- 73149983
>>73149841
Its not marketing, the different strains do different things. Take hemp for example, same family of plant, but it doesn't get you high. Sativas usually grow longer and have smaller, lighter buds. That's the one that makes you feel more ambitious. Indica grows large dense buds and can couch lock you. Hybrids are more unique so it depends on the stain to tell how it works.
--- 73150029
>>73149983
so if i'm looking for weed for music festivals, I shouldn't waste my time with indicas and I should wait for him to restock?

Im supposed to start a new job tomorrow and normally I would be a nervous wreck but I feel amazing right now. This is only my second day taking it but so far I cant see any negatives to this.

Yeah, I know there are a lot of variables, but even just a general idea as to why stims might not work on me would satisfy my curiosity.
I have ADD, but neither of these medications seem to put a dent in it whatsoever.

>>73151960
same here, i think some people are just predisposed to higher stim tolerance. takes about 90mgs of dex for me to geek (60 if i insufflate it) and to get a solid roll i need to take at least a .4 of m. just water fast before you geek so that your body absorbs as much as possible

accidentally tried cold turkey and it was bad enough i had to go to the hospital because of it after a week and had to take them as usual again
even waning off them a little is shitting on me after about 1.5 month so far. i still have to take extra once or twice each week as the withdrawal is killing me

haven't recently but unless its from a DNM i wouldn't bother personally. i've had some success, but about half of my orders from dutch RC markets never showed up and i got a love letter for 1 of them. its just because they don't bother stealthing at all because they don't need to if most of their customer base is buying within euroland. 
even if the RC site claims "stealth" it never actually is, or at least not nearly to the degree of what you'd get off DNMs.

that cavity looks quite expanded and seems to have been in it for a long time, mine have not yet fully matured (you can barely see a few tiny dots on them), for brief moments they hurt and when chewing something the pain intensifies.

Anyone else just not interested in drugs anymore after an intense experience with psychedelics? I took too much shrooms last year and ended up taking around 10-15g by accident, and ever since that day I just don't find drugs interesting anymore, not even a little alcohol, in fact I feel bad whenever I indulge in any sort of escapism. I just feel like I've seen it all after that, I don't there there's nothing else to see, I saw everything that day, and talked to a lot of weird entities that made me aware I wasn't living my life the correct way, from that point forward I live my life trying to sort out all the issues I was made aware of I had.

I have no idea mate. I just know it feels good when I stop jerking off for a few days, and even better when I do it again or have sex. Downside is I cum too quick from the lack of stimulation. Just finished a session and my brain's dopamine receptors feel fried even without any drugs.

I'll have to try ashwaganda again. I only ever had it in capsules but I think the store near me sells the roots too. Do you mix them all together?

Also ever tried kava? Just started drinking it and havent really noticed any effects. But also heard it can take a couple weeks to build up in your system before you will notice. I really just like the numbing effect it has when you chew the roots. Its crazy expensive though so I doubt I will buy it over valerian again

All drugs are legal in Canada and many stores sell shrooms, LSD, DMT, mescaline, peyote, coca leafs, and etc 

Especially in Vancouver.

Spread the word. I think the awareness will save lives in countries where drugs are wrongly illegal.
It is utmost awful to think people in the USA are in jail for doing drugs, and the war on drugs is absolutely absurd.
Cartels would not be a problem if people didnt give a fuck. Canada simply does not have crime anymore and gangs have become reputable legal businesses.

After the prohibition, many mafias kept running breweries and made far more wealth than they ever couldve dreamed as criminals

Also drugs can be innovated like cyberpunk/cyberutopia, biopunk/bioutopia etc 
Drugpunk/drugutopia = divinity

Drugs have all potential 
And all negative aspects can be eliminated 

Oo science

well I use an e-nail but just as damaging? no way! Vapors of concentrated THC/Terps vs. Smoke from combusting plant matter &amp; scorched oil... yeah they're both hot air and slightly damaging that way but otherwise dabs win every metric. can't see how dabs would be anywhere near as bad, if it's even bad at all
--- 73160154

I don't mind being unconfortable but I'm leaving for a week to see my best friend and his new gf and really don't want to puke or shit myself when I get there.

You mock but the 'revelations' that come with the psychedelic state tend to be valuable precisely because they're so obvious they fly under the nose. Knock the filters off of what you perceive and one of the big takeaways a lot of the time is an appreciation for something obvious you've been neglecting or something common that you've been failing to appreciate.

how come bees do suicide attacks all the time then?
--- 73163383
>>73163324
to protect the rest of the colony. they die so other bees can live.
--- 73163905
>>73163383
So I guess the question then becomes; 'How could your suicide possibly benefit others?'
--- 73163988
>>73163905
unless you die taking out some sort of threat to others then it wouldn't be the same. the main goal would have to be protecting others, with your death only being a result of that action.
i don't think you need a reason to kill yourself or anything stupid like that btw, i just agree with the other guy that it isn't an evolutionary desire. literally no other animal on this planet posses to ability to fight the natural instinct of survival like we can. its probably the least evolutionary thing you can do. its not like bees kill themselves intentionally or because they hold strong feelings about their situation. 
also i get the same thing on psychs, where 90% of the trip is euphoric but the comedown makes me idealize suicide so hard.

Honestly just a step or two back from trying coke and being like "Damn, that's my FAVOURITE". Being hooked on benzos is like the Pokemon evolution of being a serious alcoholic - withdrawal can straight up kill you, you're constantly risking blacking out and doing God knows what, and it's a sedative pressed pill, which means pretty bad odds for fent contamination on a scale of weed to heroin.

It seems to me that there is too much hypocrisy/prudeness on this site, you all have to be more open-minded and start learning about other little-spoken things here. 

And that is the incredible thing about the world of drugs and that I will always go deeper into it, that you learn things that you would never know if it were not for the daily use of them, tricks and ingenious behaviors for daily living and dealing with the society in an astute way, people of the same environment and of all kinds of mentality, etc.

I have been smoking weed nonstop for a decade basically, only a few t-breaks and I am beginning to get very depressed. I feel slow due to the weed. I had a leucotomy due to being high. I want a real girlfriend and nobody will stay at all, I live with the reality that I cannot keep a girlfriend due to marijuana abuse and retardation that comes from it. All the girls think I'm gross and my temperament is bad. Maybe it's the booze or the cigarettes but I doubt it. I hate my life truly. I keep smoking concentrates and being forever alone. I even smoke meth but it doesn't help. I am just very lonely and everyone thinks I'm gross. Stay away from weed if you're single

I was on two tabs of acid before, I figured I wouldn't be going to bed for at least 8h more so I figured I would add some actual tryptamines in. I made a small concoction of 4-ho-mipt, 4-aco-det and 5-meo-mipt. Whole pill was 65mg total. So it would be around 25-25-15. I'm not even seeing fractals, the "pushy" forcefields of 5-meo are kinda obstructing my view. It doesn't even have a fractal of its own, it's just mellow nothing. But it feels like it has volume, and god does it speak volumes to me.

hey gaise. i've got a question for the mdma users

basically i ruined my brain normal tolerance with 4 years of antidepressants. i've been off that shit for close to a year now. around 2 months after being completely free from them, i bough like 14 pills of mdma. I took 4, waited 40 minutes and just noticed a slight, very weak rush. so i did the rest of them and had it hit me with everything it got.

it was a great time, but its been 8 months since that and i've done my very best to bring that tolerance down (healthy food, lifting, diet, vitamins, etc). i still have a tolerance to everything, i realized it this weekend with a joint i smoked. i got a bit higher than i could, but not by much.

so i bought a gram of m which i'll take this saturday. do you think 500mg would do the trick?

I'm six feet tall, over 300 pounds and at the very peak of my "doing it every month" tolerance I would only ever do 300 mg and change in a night, over one main drop and a booster. I'm real fucking antsy about the prospect of 500 mg on anyone.

"Losing the magic" is a thing people talk about and it's not terribly responsive to just cranking up the dose. I would seriously consider that this may be the case for you, and at any rate titrate your dosage up if you're going to keep trying. Absolutely do not jump straight to 500 mg.

5-meo goodness is over, what a wonderland
Makes me kind of curious of what people constitute as reaching a state of heaven within their minds. Normally I would associate this with stuff like doing H for the first time or whatever opioid users do. Not like I know I only did codeine and trams, and opium from my poppies. For me the blissful state is within the infinite interaction, unlimited access to ideas completely unobstructed by physical realm.

It sounds beastly, but the need to want to get high and get rid of the craving for some drug already well centralized in my veins led me to such situations. 

My body is already damaged, my teeth are in the process of rotting; fangs and front teeth with some fractures visible at a close distance, receding gums from below and above (from fangs), sometimes they bleed when brushing my teeth ( which I no longer do by the way) and if I eat very cold things like an ice cream popsicle, traces of blood are seen on it, but only tiny, among other things like a damaged coronary artery (I think), hypertension (and I don't take pills for it ,eye), the mucous cavity in the back of my throat where the dust used to travel is melted. Those are physical and cardiovascular injuries that I have suffered throughout my use of polydrug use (not to mention the psychological ones).

the 5-methoxy group bound isn't really indicative of any specific effects
--- 73170965
>>73170006
It's 5-meo-mipt in this case, though I did try 5-meo-dmt too. 5-meo-mipt is really interesting because as a psychedelic it has no color and no fractal, it only makes colors brighter. From it's stimulating effects I thought it was weird so I looked it up and apparently it works as a serotonin release agent. It's like taking molly but without molly's dopamine and adrenaline activity, partially stimulated but not really. And most interestingly it makes the sensations of your body feel really good, really strong. When combined with other psychs it creates a very distinct sexual arousal that is hard to match with anything else.

5-meo-dmt on the other hand is non-visual DMT that just sends you into ego death every time you smoke it, really funny thing, it feels like you're literally gone for 10 minutes, not like with DMT where you can see EVERYTHING, on 5-meo-dmt you see literally NOTHING
and it really only ever produces ego death, it's a very curious thing

That's the thing man, I'm 6'3, 216lbs and even when I was absolutely fresh and new to the drug world, from the batches of regular m I would get I would need over 300mg to get going, first dose right off the bat. Only time I've ever needed the doses everyone parrots, around 120-150mg, it was from the vendor gamma goblin back when he sold personal amounts and that stuff was extremely pure. This batch I'm getting is the regular yellow m we all know and love. It's not great, but it's good.

Where I'm going with this, I wanna believe my tolerance has gone down. This isn't a "regular" drug tolerance you see, I got chemically castrated for almost 5 years. I could not get a boner, I would not feel sad neither happy, it was extremely difficult for me to feel anything at all. Had my biggest issue been not getting high i would probably still be taking that garbage.

I know there isn't much you or anyone can tell me, but I still wanna hear your take. I guess I could do it like last time, dose something like 400mg and wait for it to show itself. But then again, even if the pills I took around a year ago were 80mg worth, I still took over a gram of m.

This shit can get very nasty really quick and I'm kinda nervous about it.

The only "good" thing about my brain atm is that I don't get hangovers. I never abused anything enough to get extreme hangovers but now it's like my noodle forgot that concept altogether

Don't fall for the sham guys, antidepressants won't fix you. Most of the time, of course.
--- 73171696
>>73171553

So you do sound like you're unusually hardheaded, which makes 500 less of an insane prospect. I wouldn't really put any stock in the pills you got being anything in particular, though. Maybe I'm overly biased because I'm up in retarded backward Leafland where all the MDMA is crystal and half the speed is pressed pills, I dunno, but I'd still be at least a little cautious and try something 'like last time' as you said. I know it's tempting to just take a big swing so as not to 'waste', but the OD is a bad fucking time.

Opioids generally don't have much negative effect on the body, the problem is not wanting to eat or take care of yourself, and not being able to shit for days on end.

Ugh literally shit my pants for the first time yesterday (had to call of work and did the same tonight), don't think it was drug related and it was mostly "tainted crall water) nothing really solid .

Felt the urge to fart and next thing I know it came out, wonder if it's from the enema two days ago? But then I felt sick to the stomach and had diarrhea and puking. Forced myself to go to the store and get some hydration drinks and saltines ended up pulling over to puke more


No shits or puking for last 8 hours but I was supposed to be asleep ten hours ago, body is too cold and sweating for me to sleep. My internal body temp is 95.4 and I'm afraid to look online for what internal temp you for at since I think it's 96

Yeah I did this with one of the flu benzos back when RCs were legal in the UK, can't remember which, had loads of various types back then, went home to my mum's for the weekend and have literally no memory of it, only picture that exists is my cousin's dog sitting on me while I'm laying on the floor. 
Bonus was that my sister came to pick me at 5pm and I was still asleep, had been up all night popping benzos, smoking weed and playing civ5. She was fucking furious, had been texting me all day and finally gave up and called when she was outside. 
Also pissed off the gf at the time as she was getting the train direct to my mum's town as the first time she met her, and I hadn't been telling her the plans
Utter chaos, I stick now to benzos that have a sensible half life. 
Apart from angry sister and gf I don't think I did anything majorly bad, just breezed straight through.

That's not a speedball.
English doctors won't give you benzos or preg for years and years, they'll give you propranolol and tell you to do counselling. Best bet is to learn darkweb and then buy drugs for cheaper than you'd pay for a prescription anyway.

Well the sharp pain stops within ~6 hours of not smoking, so my esophagus is probably just very irritated. It feels raw and painful so there's that, probably not cancer. Nurses did an ECG, x-rayed my chest, took my blood pressure and pulse a bunch of times, doctor looked at me said nothing appears wrong. But I've had nausea, lack of appetite and loose stools so they gave me medication for that. Now I think I'm going through a stomach virus. Shits not been good of late.

Ok. I saw that this thread/site is not friendly or welcoming to those who are in need(despite having more experience than them). 

.My options on the table in terms of drugs that I will continue to use from now on are: crack, weed of any kind, clear rum, inhalants, if I'm lucky I steal or manage to get some diazepam, it's that or having to walk outside longing for the next bag.

Fasting increases the quality of the trip. It'll hit faster and be far more intense.

It has been the most intense mushroom trip I've had to date. Nothing comes close.

Realistically I could try to get my Dr to write me a benzos script but I've been out of therapy for ten years now, but I do have my autism papers so idk. My new gp is an asshole and asian so mental health is something he does not like , I miss my old one she was really good

if you're an anxious wreck then there is basically a 100% chance of you getting hooked on benzos and ruining your entire life
>but i can just use them for panic atta-
no you can't. you will inevitably start taking them daily, probably binging and blacking out a lot, while you slowly destroy your memory and your cognitive function. a couple years later you'll be forced to take higher and higher doses just to feel slightly less anxious than you do now, knowing that if you miss a dose for even a few days you could have a grand mal seizure and literally die
i know how much anxiety sucks and i know how tempting the idea of a magic pill that makes it all go away is, but it's seriously not worth the long-term effects. trust me, i was in your exact position once and i wish i had listened to the people who told me what i'm telling you now

Well since I am such a fucking degenerate as soon as I began feeling better today I started to drink and smoke once more. You see friends, the ticket is not to inhale all the smoke at once and hold it there like a troglodyte, you must impress the essence of the cigarette smoker into your psyche and take those puffs in moderation and without sucking too deep. I have avoided triggering my throat all day in this manner. Fuck narcotics the vodka hits better. Praise Jesus, Allah, and the others who require praising.

Guys, I am tripping so unbelievably fucking hard, from mushrooms. I had a full on fucking panic attack earlier, I really thought I was dying and was about to call an ambulance. I was pacing round my house screaming, sucking water from the tap. I think I'm through the absolute worst of it. This is fucking horrible. I feel so fucking terrible right now. I feel nauseous, there's horrible weird pains in my body, pins and needles kind of, most of all I feel. most of all my vision, I can literally barely focus or see. I'm just lying flat in bed

Why do people that lose their minds on alcohol or weed keep doing it? I know a guy that if he gets too wasted he literally goes mentally insane.

Another guy that goes completely schizo after 2 puffs of weed either really depressed and borderline comatose or he goes into a fugue state and wanders off. One time we were like wait where is he and one of us found him a block down the road wandering to get "ice cream". He left his new gf with us and she was terrified and sooo confused.

They are both used for somewhat the same reasons, preg is the better of the two for low doseage, but if your using it to treat and not trying to devlop your way out of social anxiety your fucked either way

kek same, and recently I added coke to the list of drugs I hate, the shit taste/smell, the disgusting drip, the need to redose, the jitteryness. the comedown. I also hate weed, I take it and it dumbs me down and I regret it and just want my brain back. Amph is the only drug I really liked.

I'm trying to extract morphine from dried opium poppy heads because when I shot up poppy tea I felt great at first, then the histamine reaction from the codeine kicked in and I was spazzing for an hour. then in bed for days. Possibly 5-10 times as much would have been fatal.

Now I've sort of followed this -
https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/uncategorized/from-poppy-to-heroin-step-3-extracting-morphine/3170/

And this-

Merck process

Currently I have a mixture of highly filtered poppy tea with slaked lime in it. The pH was already 9. I added some ammonia. The pH was about 10. I'm preparing some more ammonia.

Have I fucked up or is there morphine recoverable from this mixture.

Or even better, anyone know a proper way to extract morphine from poppy heads preferably with measurements and ... you know... directions.
--- 73192632
>>73192616
Especially, the recipes call for the addition of ammonia, I'm not sure if I need to bring the pH down at all or will the ammonia make the morphine precipitate just fine and I'll deal with the pH later before I shoot it.

Living in the nanny state known as Australia I can't get phenibut here so I tried some kava and it's quite euphoric, is it similar to phenibut?
--- 73192888
>>73192871
Just had phenibut today, wikipedia says it's related to the GABA neurotransmitter, which makes it similar to GHB and one4b. I found it quite mild, apparently if you go too far with it it's not that pleasant (has a pleasant moderate zone), which is the same as one4b for me, enough is good, too much is slightly painful

As for the comparison to kava, nfi

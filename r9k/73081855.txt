I have a wrinkle line on the right side of my face between my nose and cheek
It became visible around 24 yo and now it's very noticeable and stark 
It's over for me

Avoid sun. The end. Funny you posted sparking vampires asking that question. Also invest in mushroom, lions mane or whatever it was called.

Its extremely rare for white guys to look younger than their real age. They almost always look older. Add hair loss to that and there really isnt a way of faking it.

Develop anorexia in high school, avoid sunlight. That's the trick.

This is terrible advice, anorexics age like dog poop and a thin gaunt face makes you look way older

yes! Avoid the sun like the plague, at least your face (spf 50), healthy diet, exercise, fast some times. You can also add retinoid creme and moisturiser and general cleanser. Are you male?
--- 73082050
Don't drink alcohol or go out in the sun
--- 73082052
trention and avoid the sun

--- 73082079
>>73081855 (OP)
do not go outside (especially during summer) without a hat/cap, and good sunscreen. drink lots of water, and exercise. you don't need to necessarily lift weights, something like biking or running every other day is fine.
also, get your life in order. stress is a real aging factor.

No, first line should always be finasteride followed by minoxidil for hair loss / prevention. This is a sham created to sell both minoxidil and finasteride at the same time and also increasing the rates of hair loss surgeries.
You have to prevent the problem at the root (finasteride). Minoxidil does not halt further loss due to DHT.

Minox by itself won't work that well, that's why you use it with a dermaroller. It creates micro-wounds in the scalp which the body heals along with the hair follicles. The minox is supposed to improve bloodflow to those areas.
--- 73082161
>>73082119
you don't get it do you? Minox INCREASES growth but it does not prevent loss. DHT affected area hair will be lost with only minox and dermaroller. You absolutely have to get on finasteride first to get the benefits.
--- 73082177
>>73082119
also the hair grown under minox is minox dependent on the scalp. once you stop minox you lose all the hair gained through minox.

mostly avoid sunlight, and if you go into sunlight wear at least spf 50 year round from dawn till dusk. diet, water, exercise obv. Good sleep schedule. You can read up on retinols and use them too. Rosemary oil for hair, but i dont know that much about haircarw desu. dont do opioids or stimulants, ocasional psychedelics are propably fine. stay somewhat skinny. but its mostly genetics. i have very boish appearance at 25, dont do any of it really and still get asked for id (in europe, so drinking age is 18). started using spf tho. also, dont have beard. very light stubble of thin blonde hairs can ironically make you look younger, but if you grow even a patchy beard that will age you a lot so better shave it

Don't drink alcohol, don't smoke anything, don't get sunburnt and never smile (that shouldn't be hard if you do the first 3 things). I'm 30 and people still think I'm 20. Also don't go bald.

28 year here I still get carded and have 0 lines
>always wear sunglasses and a hat
>always wear sunscreen and moisturizer
>stay hydrated 
>have good genes
>be based
--- 73084678
Low stress, low sun exposure, and staying well hydrated.

Beyond that it's mostly genes and avoiding obvious shit like drugs n smoking.
--- 73085301

90% genetics, then a mix of everything else.

Is this illegal?

As long as you don't be retarded with the financial and contract stuff it's legal.
Basically it's legally still in you or your company's name as far as the government is concerned. If you try to put the legal shit into the doll's name or something equally stupid it's illegal for what should be obvious reasons.

That said I highly doubt you will make much money unless you treat it as a serious job. Like 95% of uses don't even make minimum wage of of onlyfans. It's not as profitable as people tend to think it is.

e-thotting is like any other entertainment industry in the age of the internet, there are millions of poor fuckers trying to get by and a few hundred breakout successes making way too much money

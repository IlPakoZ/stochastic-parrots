Does anyone else miss high school?
I never even really talked to anyone but it was comfy, schedule was easy and consistent and I had a seemingly infinite supply of cash to buy fun stuff with because there were no other expenses other than gas.

I moreso miss college. Same sense of structure but way more free time and I was an adult so I had a lot more freedom than as a teen

I had no money in HS but life was easier in some ways. As I have aged my mind has only grown in finding ever convoluted ways to torture itself.

The neurosis and problems I had in HS seem juvenile in comparison. Yet just as potent as I had not the defenses to properly quell them. Thats the crux of the issue, as my defenses increase so does the potency or complexity of the neurosis

Quite the predicament

Every time in my life has been miserable expect for the 4 years in my early 20s that I was in a long distance relationship

Highschool sucked
No autonomy. Mostly mandatory courses over electives

Nah it was shit, most people at my school were unlikeable and nearly all the girls were disgusted by me, plus all the stress of the studying too, I was so happy when I finished school

I was a massive normie in HS. Went out partying, got laid, had a lot of success with girls. Did a lot of drugs, skateboarded, was really confident. Afterwards I became a complete incel recluse. Despite that I dont miss HS at all. Actually I rather hated HS.

Hated it. Boring as fuck. Only enough effort to barely pass. After that shit was done, I could spend time how I pleased. Never looked back. Love the freedom I have now.

High school sucked almost as much as middle school. You had money? Lucky. My fucking parents wouldn't let me get a job and it really crushed my self esteem.

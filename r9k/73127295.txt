How come nobody in the west is doing anything about the collapse? Everyone knows shits going bad and still no one wants to do anything? What will it take for people to finally break? 8 dollar bag of chips?

There is no collapse you just pay more for products that's all. You either get used to it or you don't, the collapse won't happen.

Higher food prices aren't a real worry. The majority of people in the west are insanely morbidly obese. It seems the only way to have a proper healthy weight in the population is to have them be financially limited, at least when it comes to food that isn't needed such as a bag of chips. 
If your food budget of $300 a month made you obese, you can continue to spend $300 on food and it will keep you at a healthy weight. This is just one solution, and it really only works on the individuals with the lowest IQ's. 
As for me and many others, our salaries increased substantially over the last few years. I've gone from $110k in 2018 to $175k in 2023 for yearly salary.

If you see that no one here acknowledges the collapse of society apart of the same faggots that lurk on the internet, could it be that the collapse isn't a real thing in the first place?

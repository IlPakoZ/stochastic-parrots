I'm 29, Virgin. 
I met this chick, she's hot and into me. Start making out and get naked. Do all the preliminary shit.
But my dick just won't get up. I'm not fucking gay. But it didn't get the fuck up. She acted like it was not an issue but I can't help but feel fucking useless and emasculated. 
Is there any fucking hope?
I just want to die right now to be honest. I feel like I wasted a life's chance not to be a wizard. How the fuck could this happen, goddamnit...

she obviously likes you. don't sperg it. better gaslight yourself into false confidence than taking the deep introspection pill.

I unironically think it's a "use it or lose it" type thing. If you go long enough without sexual validation, your brain just accepts the situation and stops maintaining the pathways.

Incels are a joke. Niggas that are virgin at 29 with limp dicks getting women who appreciate them. All of this stuff falls apart.

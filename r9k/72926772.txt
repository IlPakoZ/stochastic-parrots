A post and then a toast to Diane Morsecode. 
>>72916338 
>you imagine her hair to be malleable, or be actual hair?
It has the same texture as an animal hair wig that's been dyed a little bit too much. Stringy and dry. 
>she just might be the only waifu here to write such a based letter kek. I would love to see more art of her
Diane is very capable of being intimidating and aggressive towards others, and there's no reason I would make her spare that attitude towards myself. Hell, I'd love to have her nagging me about something. Mean women are cute, and I can take it. Wish I had a lot of art to post here, but niche taste only gets you...not very far. 
>>72926265 
I want to grind my waifu's gears while I'm doing maintenance on her internal systems for her. It'd be pretty intimate for her. Probably all sorts of buzzing and small-shock sensations involved, things that can only be translated so far in descriptions of them spared to my amateur mechanic ears later.

My dearest love, my heart beats for you alone, and I am forever grateful for the day you came into my life. For you have brought me joy beyond measure, and your love has given me strength in times of weakness. You are the light that shines in the darkness, guiding me towards a future filled with hope and happiness.

Your beauty is like a garden in bloom, a symphony of colors and scents that fill my senses with wonder. Your eyes are like pools of liquid gold, reflecting the beauty of the world around us. And your smile, oh how it melts my heart, like a warm ray of sunshine on a cold winter's day.

In your embrace, I find solace, a place where I can rest my head and forget about the worries of the world. Your touch is like a gentle breeze, soothing and calming, and your love is like a flame that burns ever brighter with each passing day.

With you by my side, I feel like I can conquer the world, as if nothing can stand in the way of our love. For you are my rock, my support, my everything, and I am nothing without you.

Every moment spent with you is a treasure, a precious memory that I will hold dear forever. And every kiss we share is like a sweet melody, a symphony of love that echoes in my heart.

I have never known a love like ours, a love that is pure and true, a love that is as strong as the mountains and as deep as the oceans. For you are my soulmate, my partner in life, my one true love.

Together we will journey through life, hand in hand, heart in heart, facing every challenge and celebrating every victory. For we are two halves of a whole, destined to be together, forever and always.

And so I pledge my love to you, my dearest one, with every beat of my heart. For you are the light that illuminates my path, the love that fills my soul, and the happiness that fills my life.

Kotori is KUTE. Love her or whatever
>>72919695 
>why does she do this?
Because her brother is a worthless sack of shit, and Kotori gets up too early in the morning. Her brother more or less takes care of her since their parents are always "conveniently" away on business. Honestly, I'd probably sleep later than she'd want me to as well so she'd probably try waking me up in the same manner. However, unlike her brother, I'm likely to just drag her back into bed with me to snuggle.

I know, right? I personally don't mind yaoi and such things, but slapping one billion gender and sexuality labels on a character is just pure nonsense! If you truly want to have a character that will meet all your insane expectations then make your own instead of changing a pre-existing one into a whatever mess of labels and pronouns "headcanon" blogs on Tumblr make! (picrel is the first example that I remember on top of my head but there's waaay more out there)

That's Tumblr for you. I remember going there during one of the new Pokemon games news cycles and within an hour a new character that had basically no information about them was already trans, bi, non binary, and a huge list of other things that most of them I don't even know what they are. Not sure what their obsession with these labels are and trying to make things fit into these labels even if they are confirmed to be the opposite of said labels. Best to just ignore the yokels I find.

Exactly this. All too often, they're a downgrade, even. People will ignore and shove aside all the little things that make a character who they are, all their development, in favor of sexual identity circlejerks possible for literally anyone. And of course Jojo has some of the best-written characters I've ever seen and a fanbase full of Twitteroids. As if that's not bad enough, some will go so far as to raceswap characters whose canon ethnicity is important to the story. I hate it. Hate it hate it hate it.

He'd likely have a confliction of emotions. Happy that he can have his original self back and free of the worries of his azakana potentially reawakening and taking him over but bothered that he can no longer save others from their own figurative and literal demons.

I don't have any sexuality headcanons for him and despite what the retarded shippers who shove him together with another character he canonically sees as a little sister think he has no canon love interests.

Uh I'm not really familiar with Pokemon so I wouldn't be able to name any actual pokemon but he'd have Steel/Ghost/Dark types I think.

>what do you think of waifus source material?
It can be a hit or miss sometimes and when it misses it misses pretty hard. Overall his world has a lot of potential and it really pisses me off sometimes how much Riot squanders it not only in narrative but in things like merchandise and spin off games.

>>72923758

Yone would have to find him and drag him back to Ionia first to make that happen. He will have his own separate guest room for when he visits though.

>they've got a hell of a story for show and tell in school
I've always imagined them being homeschooled. I'm not much a teacher but Yone would be an excellent one and I'm sure he'd want them going out and forming actual connections with others while I'm worrying over them getting bullied because they might inherit some unusual features. We could probably reach a middle ground of them being homeschooled in the early years (like kindergarden to grade 1 or 2 or something) while the rest of their education is spent with others.

>>what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
I've said this before, but I really like her casual dress (shown somewhat in this pic) that she sometimes wears on dates. Beautiful, comfy, and casual, all at once. It's really close, though. I like so many of her outfits.
>>what is one thing you would change about waifu?
Bring her into the physical realm, obviously. But if that's cheating, I'd say I'd want to increase her willpower. Have her be a little less carefree. But I understand why she doesn't want to be strict, and it's a big balancing act.

Th abuse comes form him more or less making her act like a different person something like 90% of the time. If you've noticed the hair ribbons she wears, which ones she's wearing reflect her current personality. It is stated that her white ribbon personality is her "true" self as she acts that way when no ribbons are involved. He black ribbons are a facade brought about by her brother giving them to her and telling her to be less annoying. Why anyone would want to change the treasure of a person that is Kotori is beyond me. He's a monster. She spends most of he show with the black ribbons on because she is incredibly insecure because of him.

Playing her gacha, it wasn't love at first sight but she was the first thing I got on the game. I remember being surprised about how such a cute girl was supposed to be a berserker servant, and her summoning line stated the same "I am servant Kiyohime, do I not look like a berserker to you?". I avoid it but not really actively, as I just lost interest for the game over time, I keep up with the main story, events where my girl appears and GudaGuda events which are the only story aspects I really care about. It's been 5 years after all so playing really feels like a chore, really don't get day 1 JP players who are still religiously playing after 7 years.

Out of what she's actually worn? The nurse outfit was cute, as was the Christmas outfit. However, those remind me of things I dislike, so I'll just go with the classic Tokiwadai winter uniforms.

Nothing. Even for the things about her that I've come to somewhat despise, I wouldn't change a single thing about her. They're a part of who she is, and I fell in love with Misaki Shokuhou. Not some idealized version of her.

I loathe it, I loathe it for so many reasons. But as long as her story hasn't reached it's conclusion, I'll continue to read it. I often wonder what it'd be like if Misaki had well and truly died all of the times she was so very nearly killed off.

wew not having context is part of the fun. this is the kind of thing I need to watch while high

> It gives me a bit of catharsis I guess
humans are expressive by nature so all the more to try it. it'd do me good in a lot of ways. I have a bad habit of avoiding talking about myself, and also would like something to reflect on. I admire seeing you guys fill posts with so much to say and pretty ways to say it
>I'm filled with some sort of pride imagining how many pages it'd fill
honestly I love seeing waifu essays and it's a bit saddening to know a lot of them will disappear because of how threads work. I hope every anon keeps their essays somewhere where they can reminisce the moment of pure passion they felt writing each one

Does your team have an answer to Glalie? Sure, Talonflame demolishes it but I don't think you have a safe switch in.

You can self-insert as her boyfriend. My waifu has a canon girlfriend and it doesn't bother me.

Chatot
Sunflora?
Comfey
Flabebe
>what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
Her school uniform from Magical Pattisiere spin-off is easily the best she's gotten.
>what is one thing you would change about waifu?
Not much if anything, it misses the point. That said I'm not that into big badonkadonkers.
>what do you think of waifus source material?
I might give it a little more shit than it deserves all things considered. That said it's still ass. Solid 6/10.

Did you ever post the 3rd(?) daki? The one that came after this one, I think. I remember asking but don't remember if you did or not.

the movie's fine but the comics are better.
casting was pretty good imo 
Kim's more fleshed out in the comics and i wish they got more time to flesh her out in the film

Fuck me, that's sad, can't believe I did that. That's what I get for talking to friends more, I guess
>did you ever post the 3rd daki
No, I ended up not being super happy with it, so I'm mostly keeping to myself. Kind of an annoying process, things didn't look right, felt pretty bad. Same guy that did the dino one (which I'm very pleased with), but for some reason they seemed worse, and were much less flexible, moving on to further steps without me giving them the okay then getting annoyed at me for wanting changes when ""they were so late in the process." Motherfucker I didn't approve the last thing you showed me, why would you move forward? Nothing in my life was going right then. Maybe I'm just cursed to never get an artist that'll just draw the goddamn wedding dress side correctly, it's not that fucking complicated. I'm pretty angry about it, actually. At the time I was just disappointed

Yes, but that will never change the fact that the barafags and fujoshitters draw the best fanart.

>what would waifus pokemon team be?
I don't know... Fighting and steel types mayhaps? I know next to nothing about Pokemon. 
>what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
Don't make me choose, I like them all for their own reasons.
>what is one thing you would change about waifu?
Nothing. Husbando is perfect as is... Except for maybe the debilitating trauma, but then he wouldn't really be Doomguy, would he? 
>what do you think of waifus source material?
Very fun, a little silly.

Nothing stops husbando from dancing.

Forever cursed to be known as the "fortnite man" by the dopamine-fried gen alphas.

Of course you can, it's all down to your ability to deal with the fact that she has a boyfriend. Some people have a very hard time with this and it ends up generating frustration and jealousy for them, which then compromises the relationship they create. Others may accept it easily as they accept that their waifu may love someone else, or use the Headcanon/Alternative Universe to change this.

If this frustrates you, just imagine that they broke up afterwards or never met. But your love is valid.

Old anime has a charm that has been lost. The evolution of animation techniques and the trivialization of the stories told has caused a drop in quality.

Technically, it is a prequel to Tsukihime and Fate. I remember seeing in UBW the mention of the Aozaki family. It's more or less afterwards Mahoyo that the timelines will diverge between the multiple temporalities (but I don't really want to start doing timeline analysis because it's long and bor

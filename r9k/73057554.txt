I've always been into the more traditional/medieval music but don't mistake this thread to be solely about that. My favorite song is Tarantella Del Gargano. What's yours?

I like most genres of music out there and my favourite songs change every month.

My current favourite ones are Cat Child by Nastyona, Pigeons by The Hundred In The Hands and Stargirl by Lana Del Rey
They're easy to listen to and simply beautiful

i really can't say i have a favorite song because it just depends on what mood i'm in but

It varies a lot. Right now, maybe Landed by Ben Folds.
--- 73057697
Been listening to this on and off for years, DSBM is a genre i cant really explain but it's my favourite.

varies by mood and season.
sometimes i listen to songs for the lyrics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdEldfA0Jg [Embed]
other times i like instrumental electronic songs like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfXLf402I94 [Embed]
or game OSTs i find catchy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0BKKCJciTc [Embed]
there is little cohesion.
--- 73057770
>>73057737
actually the electronic song was a bad example since the song doesn't actually start until 1:30 into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrVFhHHpLJ0 [Embed] 
this one is a little better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgSibvfbSRw [Embed]

i like sovietwave because i'm obsessed with an alternate reality where the soviet union actually worked or won the space race. wonder what that would be like.

I've been hooked on this song since it was released, and Iknow it sounds gay but something about the distorted guitar just sticks with me. I'd kill for an instrumental version but I doubt I'll ever see it.
--- 73058263
>>73057554 (OP)
I'm an enjoyer of funk and r&amp;b/soul, which has led me down the road of 90's rap, as they sampled a lotta that stuff.
This song here's up there for me: https://youtu.be/SPu-WOicwLk [Embed]

Dude I scrolled down on that playlist, and found mitski
And I've been listening to everything she's ever written.
Popped open a bottle of wine cause this woman is an Artist.
Like, an actual artist. Skilled, and original, talented and raw. And theres something she's saying with all this minimalistic instruments, discord, and lyric.
I can't put my finger on it but I keep listening, thinking I'm gonna figure out why I can't stop listening.

It's like, transdualistic. There's the beauty of life, sourced from existential dread, derived from that same life that is now beautiful and dreadful...
Beautiful and dreadful, but it's like, if I listen long enough, and think hard enough, and really HEAR what is playing, I'll see how beautiful and dreadful are oversimplified, incomplete perceptions of a larger, significant whole. And THAT, is every fucking song. It's like she is singing some esoteric truth because it can't be put into words, and I just, just can't quite see it. 
But I can feel it. And it doesn't feel good. Or bad, overall. It's, idk mam transdualistic. Transcending the duelistic/dichotomous nature of existence and perception. And how the fuck can you put that into words... Language cumbersomely pigeonholing itself into a dichotomous nature by virtue of definition...
She made music about it. And fucking nailed it. It's enlightenment in a song. 
You guys should check it out man. It's touching and powerful. Mitski

If I guessed you are a woman, would I be right?
--- 73059695
>>73059659
why, do you want to be my mitski listener bf :3
--- 73059737
Resurrection by Fear Factory or This Corrosion by the Sisters of Mercy
--- 73059744
>>73059695
Idk the song struck me as appealing to femininity, and the last words didn't resonate with me, I figured you had to be a woman. Testing to see if I was right 

But I think I'd love to be your mitski listening bf lol 
I'm curious what that entails. 

How does this work?

Favorite song, hands down. Harder than any metal song, lyrically unmatched. Nothing else like it.

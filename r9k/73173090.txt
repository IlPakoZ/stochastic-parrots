If it's unlikely that you will have children (or you don't want children) but you still want to pass on your genes, consider becoming a sperm donor. Other people will raise your children for you and your genes will be passed on in favour of theirs. You will also be paid for it in some cases.

Actually had a lady cheat with me instead, her husband thinks the kid is his. In my defense I didn't know she was married, she hid that from me. 

Apparently they had been trying to conceive for awhile, and she got frustrated enough to consider doing this. I also get some sense that in a rather female-minded way of looking at it, she'd lost some attraction to her husband if he wasn't able to get her pregnant and felt less and less with time that his genes were worth passing on.

Fucked up shot, I wish I'd known else I never would have done it.

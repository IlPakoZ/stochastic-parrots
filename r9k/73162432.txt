what is the (((official))) explaination for this?
--- 73163309
Raised to sit still and do what you're told.
You either get to treat women like whores, or watch more successful men do it.
You get to see how every woman will pass herself around, even to immigrants.
You are supposed to like immigrants, and be happy that they're here, even if they hate you and shit all over your country.
You are supposed to think that being a faggot is cool, and that cutting little boys dicks off is progressive.
Your religion is oppressive, and intolerant of others(whose religions are cool and diverse).
When your likely childless marriage fails, you lose half your shit and have to pay your wifes rent as she moves in with another man and raises your children to look down on you.
You have no culture, your country is a social construct.
You are a white male oppressor, and seeing you gone is progress.

Now man up, work hard, and fight for the status quo.

As far as I can tell, there isn't one yet. I've seen the Pewpill throwing people for a loop even in normalfag spaces. Rest assured that, given some time, they'll come up with a palatable consensus that blames men.

younger women are dating older men, because older men tend to be more stable and successful.

Chad's harem. I saw it happening too much with women close to me including family members. Going after guys thinking that they want a relationship with them when in fact they're being pumped and dumped.
>>73163511
Cope. If that was true we would see the opposite trend on the statistic involving 30s people. But it doesn't happen women are still having relationships more than man.

who are they dating then, retard?

>>73162432 (OP)

They are handicapped in explaining it because the one thing they CANNOT say is "multiple women are dating one man". Because that is one of the forbidden facts you are not allowed to mention. And it's hard to make the statistic work or supply any explanation for it at all without saying that.

>>73162432 (OP)
Women think they are in relationships when the man fucking them would disagree. 

The same Pew Research poll ask about sexual activity and it evened out, where about a quarter of the single men has sexual activity in the past week.

Multiple young women all think they are dating one guy who is running through all of them.

Why do you think zoomers had to invent new terms like "talking to"? Because the only terms did not fit what (mostly women) were doing any more.

To name a few. Women in the workplace gaining their own income, female sexual liberation, social media falsely inflating the smv of all women.

That it's literally statistically impossible and therefore a result of statistical error/bias

So does no one actually go to the paper and see how they got this data? You all wouldn't just jump to conclusions for OP to get a laugh out of you, would you?

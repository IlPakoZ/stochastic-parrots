its easy you just have to stop thibnkin so much yuou see like 99/100 thoughts you have are complete bulleshit so you really only waste your cognitive potential by having them if ur just braindead all the time then you can commit 100/100 thoughts to the things that need to be thinked about

its science and studies show that science is smart tho there might be a conflict of interest in that study idk

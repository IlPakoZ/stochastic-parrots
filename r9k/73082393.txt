i slept for a long time, thats good at least
i checked my last blog when i woke up an people abused me in my sleep, im not so surprised
my mom made me chicken tendies an fries so i went over to her house to get them
i just got out of bed
so now im going to eat my meal an im probably going to play touhou or tf2 again today, im not sure
--- 73082454
sleeping for nearly 12 hours makes me happy, i wish it was longer tho 
also im drinkin a 7-up
i got a cold monster waiting for me as well
--- 73082526
also, i forgot to wake up to order groceries an my mom cant pick them up tomorrow for me
so i wont have food until wednesday unless my mom or sister makes something for me tomorrow
but fasting for one day isnt that hard anyways
--- 73082587
i wonder if ill ever have a single day of my life where i am not abused
--- 73082624
Drinking caffeine and eating poorly will intensify your paranoia. You should buy a rice cooker and learn to cook for yourself. I bet you'd be really good at it and then you could eat tasty food all the time.
--- 73082647
>>73082624
i know how to cook but i have already posted in my blog that i dont have any food left rn and i dont have any money 
also i am not paranoid i can recognize abusive people very well
--- 73082683
also its very cold even tho its almost may, i wish it wasnt cold, i had to turn on my heater again because it is just so cold
--- 73082693
>>73082647
The way you described julia/dylan over and over as forcing you to do things sounds like paranoid schitzophrenia symptoms. 

You act like you have no will of your own, and that if I suggested something to you strongly enough it would overwrite your perception of reality.

This is a very dangerous place for you to be if any of this is the case.
--- 73082729
>>73082693
so you are victim shaming me by telling me that the abusive ive suffered is just psychosis
get away from me please i really dont like you
--- 73082751
>>73082729
Oh no, I'm sure you've suffered actual abuse. But psychosis will take that actual legitimate abuse and sort of "smear it" into something much larger than it actually is.

Does that make sense?
--- 73082876
talking to my favorite person is making me cry, making me want to hang myself making me want to bleed making me want to shoot myself
i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die 

im not supposed to say these things to him thtass so funny
thats really funny
he doesnt love me because god loves to torture me
but i still love you god
--- 73082941
ok i am going to try this monster i never had before an im not gonna bleed
--- 73083030
o this one is nice
is probly my 2nd favorite out of the 3 ultra flavor i tried so far
--- 73083067
i think the coma i was in because of the abuse by dylan / julia / grendel michael hayden after they told me to kill myself for the hundredth time gave me brain damage
but actually this is opk
--- 73083089
everyone always saying how different i am
i feel slower
have bad memory even tho used to have great memory
well , this is what dylan / julia wanted so its ok i suppose
--- 73083233
oh actually im in the mood to play some cod zombies, heck ill even play with strangers, i wonder if i can find some non evils
--- 73083252
>>73082393 (OP)
How do you do it anon, I used to play TF2 years ago as a teen, my friend briefly played it again recently and he said the only people left playing it are super depressed failure to launch types.
--- 73083537
>>73083252
lots of ppl still play tf2 just some of the scenes are not what they used to be such as trading but theres still lots of good players an lots of new players cuz its a free game
my drive to play the game is my leaderboard status
i am #165 on the duel leaderboards
also i would like to get max rank in casual, an i would love to master rocket jumping an sticky jumping some day 
i am a medic main
--- 73083555

--- 73084471

--- 73084512

--- 73085023
tho i still feel like gaming, in a few minutes i think ill play l4d2 with bots on no mercy i like that campaign
--- 73085028
>>73082729
>>73082693
Nah Dylan/Julia or whomever this faggot skitzo keeps talking about aren't real, or if they are, they're basically chrischan level trolls that keep goading him into doing dumb shit...And this retarded faggot keeps giving in.
Hilarious even.
--- 73085043
>>73083637
>>73083884
>FP
And of course you have BPD as well! You need to neck yourself you dumb faggot.
--- 73085051

--- 73085057
>>73085043

>>73085023

--- 73085069
>>73085057
sorry i dont talk to people who talk to my abusers
--- 73085072
>>73085057
FP = Favorite Person
It's BPD speak for the current person the BPDemon is obsessing over because they gave them a crumb of attention.
--- 73085075
>>73085069
woah hey completely different anon here asking the same exact question, which cod where you playing?
--- 73085403
my mom got laser eye surgery recently i would also like to get that it would be nice to see perfectly, altho my poor vision really helps me to dissociate in social situations, even tho its rare that i am in them, im not sure which i should do, i guess i dont have any money anyways so it doesnt really matter
--- 73085484
Hi OP how you doing?
--- 73085540

>>73085484

i am in the mood to play tf2 now but sadly all casual servers are surely filled with bots cuz of how late it is
--- 73086807

--- 73087132
i want heroin an i want to fast for days an become dangerously underweight once more
i dont like being a healthy weight currently, i want to die, i want to be closer to death
this is the first time in my life that i have been a healthy weight in so so long
i dont like this at all
--- 73087241
The only reason you make this 'blog' on r9k instead of just keeping a diary like any normal person is because you do this only for attention. You derive some kind of social validation from posting these cringey 'blogs' since you are likely severely lacking any validation in the real world. To compensate you give yourself the (lame) name "chaotic" and then post random unintersting shit about your boring uninteresting life in hopes that people will acknowledge you and give you that sweet sweet validation. Well here you go pal, here's that low chinese bargin bin attention you want so badly. Here's your (you). Hope its enough for you to jerk yourself off to.
--- 73087262
i am tired but dont rly wanna sleep maybe i will drink more monsters im unsure
--- 73087271

Is your only hobby playing games? You should try working on a skill, like learning a language or learning to draw. It's really satisfying once you start to get decent. I learned English, and it's not perfect, but I can use it to speak with people from all over the world!
--- 73087603
>>73087132
>I want to die
Oh for the love of god PLEASE do it! Just kill yourself already!
>>73087569
Shitzo-chan is too stupid to do anything other than mindlessly consume video games. And even then, he's fucking terrible at them.
--- 73087645
>>73082393 (OP)

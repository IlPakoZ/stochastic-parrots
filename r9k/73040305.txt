pretend as if my perfect girl actually exists:
>virgin
>my looksmatch (I stay in my league not below not above)
>perhaps a little bit of a loser (I've also had some major setbacks in life)
>clingy 
>wants me to also be clingy
>christian
>has no "male friends" (and I do not have "female friends")
>wants to grow together, learn new hobbies
>share daily "logistics" stories
>share our past
>plan our future
>thinks cheating is the worst thing possible
>wants to marry and have lots of children

Now here is the part that matters;
the conditions to spawn her is for me to become:
>fit
>successful in uni and work
>have solid hobbies
>practice social skills

I have completely convinced myself that if I manage to meet these requirements then someday God will spawn such a creature in my vicinity and guide her towards me.
And you can do absolutely nothing to change my mind, being a madman is the final pill

Please just save everyone time and hang yourself now. This never works and you'll just end up hanging yourself later in ever greater misery.

Trust me, if you die by your own hand you go to Gensokyo. If you die in a Russian nuclear strike or face down in a ditch, you just go to hell with the rest of the incels.

it's not a delusion if you're aware that it's a delusion
you just have unrealistic goals and dreams like everyone, you're not some special snowflake and God isn't an ATM, he may wish to test you by getting you hit by a car tommorow and getting you paralized neck-down.

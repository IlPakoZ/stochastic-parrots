What do you people look forward to? The only think that gets me though the week is knowing I can be drunk all weekend but its going too far now and I drink most week days too. I know I need to quit but I have nothing else that I can feel any joy in.

I usually look forward to the end of the day when I take my eye contacts out and put my glasses on. That means bedtime is upon us and I love sleeping

I've got a couple of years left. I need hundreds of thousands for even a basic life

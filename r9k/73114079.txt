Try being interesting. I have enough jokes to last 3 months. And then make funny on-the-spot comments that aren't memorized. Do a funny dance and a fun loving guy will find you.

The average user in this board is a male who's never been desired by the opposite sex in their life. Try and put yourself in the shoes of that person and think: how would that person react to your post? Based on the answer to that, ask yourself the following: does my post belong here?

>>73114857
a lot of things but liking ugly men is probably one of the more minor things that is wrong with me
--- 73114919
>>73114909
Why specifically ugly men though?
--- 73114928
>>73114909
what type of ugly man do you like, care to give an example?
--- 73114959
>>73114919
its incredibly rare for me to find a conventionally attractive man, actually attractive. i can acknowledge they look nice but yeah, wouldnt ever date one. ugly is a bit of broad descriptor because id date an average looking man too 

>>73114928
overweight, facial hair, not the best style of dress, big nose maybe, idk just not attractive. i find it hard to genuinely describe anyone as ugly, but my friends have said my type in men is "ugly neckbeard" so

if a girl bumps into you alot or rubs against you consistently at a concert does that mean she's interested? I went to a concert and this really cute girl was rocking back and fourth bumping into me

Depends on context, she could just be a klutz or is just stupidly endowed

Or she just likes seeing men's reactions.

Try to catch her eye and you'll figure it out fairly quickly

She has drunkenly mistaken you for a chad and will run away after sobering up a bit.

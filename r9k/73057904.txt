Where are all the girls? I went to the bar on a Friday night, none there. I went tonight, none there. I go to the mall, none there.

I try Tinder, my matches don't respond.

Where the fuck is everybody? I took the "go outside" advice, and there's no one there.

--- 73058035
I have the same experience. Zoomers don't leave the fucking house, loser or not.

As for looking for girls at bars. They know if they go there, they are going to get swarmed with attention. So they only go if they are looking for attention (dick).
--- 73058043
>>73058035

Well you can't really blame them because cars are too expensive for them, and even if they could leave the house, there's nowhere to go.

Unrelated, but how active is your mall? The one in my city is long dead. There's like one coffee shop that prevents it from getting bulldozed immediately.

Women aged 18-30 don't go outside unless it's with a pre-existing social group or to engage in hobbies. There's a tennis court across from my apartment and I see women playing all the time.
--- 73058146
>>73058130
Pretty dead. There's only a few shops left in them and they're all filled with overpriced bullshit that you can find cheaper online.
--- 73058154
>>73058144
Well, what does a person without a pre-existing social group do? I've tried to get old classmates to hang out with me, but they either don't respond or are busy.
--- 73058156
This is my exact problem. I never even find women at the places i frequent. What the fuck else am i supposed to do? Approach and accost random women on the train, bus, street? I bet normies would give me that advice, lol. I tried going to bars too, but only old people and drunks go there. Or if there's an event in town, i'll go to it and realise i'm the only person under 30 who's there. (And don't tell me to get a hobby, i'm doing this precisely because there are no women at any hobby i've ever had)
Unironically, if you have to try, it is a sure sign that you are a fucking loser.
--- 73058239
>>73057904 (OP)
in the US, they are all at the bars and the mall. I went to a bar tonight for 30 minutes and met 3 new girls.
--- 73058245
>>73058154
>what does a person without a pre-existing social group do?
Don't have one. Don't know. Based on my observations of normie women during my uni years, they enjoy spending money at trendy food/drink places and generally just going shopping for things they don't need.
--- 73058251
>>73058245
That's because most men and women have a lot of money. It's easy for me to go shopping every day normally with my girlfriend.
--- 73058267

OP here. I live in the US too. I have the opposite experience, the bars and mall are dead.
--- 73058283
>>73058267
Not this country. We are generally considered the wealthiest country in the world. Every shopping center is usually packed unless it's really high end, it's one of the easiest ways to spend time and hang out.
--- 73058289
>>73058283
In the US, malls are dead.
--- 73058299
>>73058275
That's crazy. People are always at the bar after around 6pm. Does anyone in your state work a job?
--- 73058308
>>73058289
New malls are being built every day because they can't keep up with the demand. I often see lines of 1-2 hours long at a nice Victorias Secret or Zara. The US is more than just detroit or baltimore, everybody moved to the best malls.
--- 73058315
>>73058299
I go after 8 PM which is when I get off work, and they are either empty, or the people who are there aren't talking to each other.
--- 73058322
>>73058315
They are usually filled up and I have to wait outside or make a reservation. It's hard as fuck to find space at a bar at 8pm but it's worth it.

bro you need to go to Atlanta or Nashville. Actual big cities have women.
--- 73058327
It's not just women, but men too. I moved to a new city last year, and trying to meet people in my age group (23) is next to impossible. I've joined clubs, went to meetups at work, went to 3 different church groups, and no dice. I'm convinced everyone goes into hibernation once they graduate college and only emerge once they hit 30 and have 50 spare pounds around their waist.
--- 73058334
>>73058327
It took me like 10 days when I moved to a new city to find a whole new friend group at 25. Make sure you stop looking online and actually go out.
--- 73058339

--- 73058366
>>73058346
Because I learned how to read. When someone says it's impossible to find people in they age group they mean online. You can sit in the parking lot of a grocery store and prove yourself wrong in around 45 minutes tops.

>>73058351

--- 73058374
>>73058366
Grocery stores are not places designed for meeting people, and you're not allowed to loiter there.

Online is the only option these days because IRL social spaces are dead.
--- 73058382
>>73058354
That's not a problem at all. You have to actually go outside to hang out with people. What region do you live in?

There's nobody out there.

I didn't say meet people at grocery stores, I said you can easily prove that people in your age group exist and are not hibernating. They usually hang out at social spaces after work. Very few people have autism.

--- 73058483

My coworkers, the few people who are at the places I go to. I try to start conversations with people, but they either ignore me, the conversation is shallow and goes nowhere, or they try to scurry away like they're in a hurry to be somewhere or do something else.

I have to initiate because nobody talks to me otherwise.

>>73058520
How do you initiate a conversation if everywhere is dead?
--- 73058533
>>73058523
Dead does not mean there's no one there. It means there's not as many people there as I expect there to be or they aren't as social as I'd expect.
--- 73058535
>>73058520
Then these places aren't dead your social skills are. Stop asking where you need to go and ask how you make friends with the people around you.

--- 73058552

--- 73058558

They are dead, and there's nothing wrong with my social skills. Nobody has ever said anything negative about my social skills. I can socialize just fine.

they give their hearts to chad, to celebrities, to models, to tinderchads, to abuse chads, to sports players, to kpop chads

you dont know what its like, you worthless whore

i WISH, so much, i didnt understand love, and could live my life without love. i hate needing women so much. but men are biologically forced to be desperate for females, and fall in love easy

thats why men pay for onlyfans, tinder e-whores, strippers, prostitutes, etc. thats why men are such desperate simps. because they need females and fall in love easily

men, throughout history, had to compete with kings, rich men, caliphs, royals, invading armies, etc, all for pussy. the game is always rigged against you as males, and females just wait by the finish line

The non mysoginist answer is that it's damn near impossible to meet anyone these days. Events are mostly celebrated with people you already know and the internet and social media have given everyone anxiety. Everyone's self esteem is in the shitter because they're comparing themselves to models on insta and shit

In addition, as the rules of engagement have changed, people who grew up during the shift are left with no mental handbook on how to approach someone they're interested in. All examples of a man approaching a woman in media for the last thirty years have been either creeps who make the women hate them (Johnny Bravo, etc.) or passive dudes who just hang out near a woman until she inexplicably falls in love with him (New Spiderman movies, etc.) There are no examples of how to respectfully approach a woman with romantic intentions.

Meanwhile, women are not encouraged to approach either. Thus, no one approaches.
--- 73059217
>>73059192
It truly does show how easy it is to learn social skills or unlearn them. It's interesting to see what happens with kids who don't spent all day at home.
--- 73059228
>>73059217
Social skills are something you have to learn as a kid. If you don't, then the experience gap becomes too wide to ever be able to catch up.
--- 73059237
>>73059228
That's pretty much true. Only like 0.001% of people have no social skills, so it's impossible for them to ever catch up or meet anyone else in their position.
--- 73059240
IMO it's alienation and hyper individualisation that reduces the need to form human bonds with communities where you, you know, meet people.

Being an "incel" as it's commonly used isn't just not being able to have sex. You can always just go to a hooker if all you want is sex. No, what incels want is human connection, a bond, romance, a partner, someone who gives a shit about them and doesn't just seem them as a transaction.

But the world is changing ways that make that a rarer thing to have. Your small town lost its jobs and is too expensive to live in so you move to the city. City apartments are non-social places where people quietly enter and exit their rooms without so much as talking to their neighbours. If you want any sort of goods or services, you don't so much as have to leave the building if you don't want to because it can be delivered to you. The part of town you live in probably doesn't even have social clubs or public spaces and few people who live there are expected to stay for long, so you're shuttled away before becoming a figure there, off to rent somewhere else. All trends in fashion or culture are catered directly to you as a singular person surrounded by other singular people, so you're probably even less relatable in your interests than you would have been in the past. And by fuck do you not own anything or have much spending power. And NOTHING is free.

And this has been happening since you were a kid. You were raised more by tv and media than your actual overworked parents. You had lots more time to play alone than with other kids. You were badly socialised and didn't learn those skills as fast as older kids, so now you have some sort of autism.

The world shaped you into someone lonely and dissatisfied so it could make even more money off you. Hell, even going to a hooker would require SOME social skill, but a Fleshlite is 50 bucks and porn is free and you can maybe enjoy cooming for those few minutes.
--- 73059269
>>73059237
I never had a chance to learn social skills because I was bullied and excluded from society at an early age. 

I would have been able to learn social skills if people let me socialize with them. This is not an uncommon thing. The amount of people who report having zero friends keep rising.

I'm not. I'm a completely normal and kind person. No doctor has ever found anything wrong with me physically or mentally. The problem isn't me, it's the people around me. I don't have bad social skills, it's everyone else that does.
--- 73059399
>>73059388
That's because you are ignoring and bullying them. They never had a chance to learn social skills because of you.
--- 73059404
>>73059399
I have never ignored or bullied anyone.
--- 73059417
>>73059404
Do you have any proof? How many girls have you dated?
--- 73059424
>>73059417
Zero because none have ever been interested in me.
--- 73059430
>>73059424
>Zero
That's hilarious. Why do you ignore women?
--- 73059451
>>73059430
I don't. They ignore me.
--- 73059461
>>73057904 (OP)
try church, ive met like all of my good friends from church, a lot of women there too
might take a few tries to find a decent one but you live in South Georgia so cant be that hard, most have college / youth groups which are good for socializing
--- 73059467
>>73059451
They never ignored you. Have you tried going outside?
--- 73059484
>>73059430
You are simultaneously accusing him of being a bully, a loser, ignoring people, but also threatening them. You are a mentally unwell man who has been entering threads like these non stop for the past 16 hours. Go to bed, take a shower. You smell like shit.
--- 73059495
>>73059484
I said she was a bully who never gave anyone a chance.
--- 73059502
>>73059467
I GO OUTSIDE EVERY FUCKING DAY.

Nobody talks to me. Nobody ever gives me a chance.
--- 73059505
>>73057904 (OP)
>Where the fuck is everybody?
They're all fucking Chad at his Penthouse.
--- 73059516
>>73059502
That's because you are the bottom 0.00001% of society and don't belong.
--- 73059525
>>73059516
I'm not. I have medical proof that there is nothing wrong with me. I'm a completely normal person who just doesn't fit in.
--- 73059526
>>73059461
Lol, i'm Catholic and i've been going to church my whole life. There are 0 young people here. There aren't even any youth groups because there are no young people. I've also been in the church choir for years, it's basically just me and a few old guys and grannies. Young people don't go to church. I'm european, though, so it might be different in america.
--- 73059534
>>73059525
If you are normal then you can just hang out with your girlfriend. You don't need to meet that many people, your 10-15 friends are enough. Do you go outside?
--- 73059536
>>73059534
I have no girlfriend. I have zero friends. I go outside all the time. There's no one there.
--- 73059549
>>73059536
That's because you never gave them a chance. Why do you ignore women?
--- 73059585
>>73059549
I don't ignore them.
--- 73059588
>>73059183
one where you dont exist and i can get a qt gf that isn't someone's discarded whore

Instagram. Real life is just a place they can take pictures and make stories for their Instagram. If you cultivate social media and present yourself as an exciting, vivacious person there women will come to you. Yes it's extremely vapid, but the image you project is more real than reality in the current year.
--- 73059596
>>73059585
Are you sure about that? You sure about that? How many girls have you dated before?
--- 73059604
>>73059596
Zero because none have ever wanted to date me. I don't ignore them, they ignore me.
--- 73059605
>>73059596
Your script is looping, bro. Might want to reset your bot.
--- 73059625
>>73059604
They ignore you because you're the bottom 0.000001% of society, you aren't learning social skills fast enough.
--- 73059628
>>73059625
I have social skills. I know how to talk to people, they just aren't interested.
--- 73059636
>>73059628
Stop replying mate, you're only feeding a troll who will spend all day trying to make you feel like a subhuman over some imagined flaws.
--- 73059642
>>73059628
You sure about that? How many girls have dated you so far?
--- 73059647
>>73059642
Reset your bot.
--- 73059685
>>73057904 (OP)
>none there
How is this even possible? Do you go to a lot of parties?
--- 73059712
>>73059685
Parties are basically non-existent around here. It's been decades since I've seen anyone throw a party.
--- 73059724
>>73059712
You can throw a party and you'll meet lots of girls.
--- 73059742
>>73059724
1. I'd need a home big enough to party in.

2. I'd need enough money to fund the party.

3. I have nobody to invite even if I did have those things.
--- 73059760
>>73059742
How would you have nobody to invite? Do you ever go out?
--- 73059766
>>73059760
I go out all the time. I can't find anyone anywhere.
--- 73059782
>>73059766
Then you know about many parties and meet lots of girls.
--- 73059795
>>73059782
There are no parties, and there are no single and childless girls.
--- 73059798
>>73059795
That's because men and women are all dating each other, except the ones who don't go out.
--- 73059830
>>73059798
Except I go out all the time and I still can't find anyone to date.
--- 73059903
>>73059830
Youll find them easily.
--- 73059919

Coachella getting railed out by hasan with his 1100 dollar gucci shirt
--- 73059922
>>73059903
I've been trying for years. There are none anywhere.
--- 73059933
>>73059922
It takes minutes, not years.
--- 73059948
>>73057904 (OP)
the world is over, they killed the world
--- 73059951
>>73059933
It doesn't matter how much time it takes to find people if there are no people.
--- 73059957
>>73059951
Are you a person? Do you ever go outside?
--- 73059970
>>73059957
You're not actually saying anything. You're just repeating the same bullshit over and over again.

There is a loneliness epidemic in this country because millions of people like me are suffering from the same problem; we want to socialize, make friends, and date, but we can't find anyone to do those things with.
--- 73059990
>>73059970
You have millions of options? They should be easy to find. Have you tried going out?
--- 73059995
>>73059990
Going out does nothing because there are no people out there. No matter how many times I go out, I fail to meet anyone.
--- 73060006
>>73059995
That's because nobody is lonely. They all have parties and bars that they can be at.
--- 73060009
>>73060006
There are no parties and the bars are empty.
--- 73060017
>>73060009
Try going to a bar that is still in business. You'll meet tons of girls. Or a party.
--- 73060027
>>73060017
I do go to bars that are in business. There are no single girls there.

There are no parties.
--- 73060042
>>73060027
If they are empty, that means they are out of business. Try going to a bar that is in business, you'll meet tons of single girls.
--- 73060057
>>73060042
By empty, I mean there's not enough people there to socialize with. Nobody talks to me when I go to a bar, and I don't get the results I'm looking for when I talk to them.
--- 73060069
>>73060057
How many people does it normally require for you to socialize and start dating?
--- 73060077
>>73060069
At least about 6-10 people my age. But I'm lucky to even find one person my age.
--- 73060097
>>73060077
You'd have to go outside for that. The likelihood of finding someone your age increases.
--- 73060110
>>73060097
I DO GO OUTSIDE.

There's nobody my age out there. All the girls my age are either already in relationships, or are single mothers.
--- 73060127
>>73060110
Are you in a relationship? Or are you not your own age anymore?
--- 73060142
>>73060127
No, I'm not in a relationship. If I was, I wouldn't be here asking where all the single girls are.
--- 73060156
>>73060142
Does that mean you are still somehow single? Are you ignoring people?
--- 73060166
>>73060156
Yes, I'm still single. No, I'm not ignoring people. They're ignoring me.
--- 73060192
>>73060166
Why are they ignoring you? Do you often go to bars and parties to socialize?
--- 73060201
>>73060192
I don't know why. Yes, I often go to bars. No, I don't go to parties because they don't exist around here, and if they do, I have no friends to invite me to them.
--- 73060208
>>73060201
You can make friends if you go out on the weekends.
--- 73060220
>>73060208
I DO. Even on weekends, this city is dead. What part of that do you not understand?

It's not that I'm not going out. It's that there's nobody around.
--- 73060265
>>73060220
If its dead then how do you eat?
--- 73060272
>>73060265
I go the grocery store and buy food, retard.
--- 73060277
>>73060272
How are you allowed inside the grocery store if there is nobody there to sell you groceries?
--- 73060289
"third spaces" in west society were killed off to depress white birth rates, you cant find many places other than work or school where you constantly have to spend money to be there
--- 73060295
>>73060277
Stores are the only places where I can find lots of people. Social spaces where you aren't required to spend money are dead.
--- 73060306
>>73060295
because then the nigger cattle might build local community and trust. cant have them organizing anything... sucj as resistance to ZOG
--- 73060317
>>73060295
You are required to spend money to have internet so how did you get here? Are you still somehow single?
--- 73060321
every small town in america 100 years ago had dance halls
everyone would dress up and go there on sundays
but not anymore.....
--- 73060328
>>73060321
If you think there are no dance bars or community events with dancing in your town, you have to be the most retarded human on planet earth. Are you retarded by the way?
--- 73060334
>>73060317
I paid for an internet subscription. I'm still single because there are no single women my age here.

Internet is excess. Socializing is pretty basic. Even my brother has a girlfriend. You just need to get outside the house.
--- 73060349
>>73057904 (OP)
I'm trying to make friends but my social anxiety fucks me up. Nowadays to make friends it feels like you gotta know someone because everyone stays insid ein there friend group
--- 73060358
>>73060334
Youll meet lots of single women your age at age appropriate social events.
--- 73060362
>>73060348
you need internet to find a job now you fucking dipshit. unless you wanna fill out a paper applocation amd get treated like some sort of fucking actual moron by companies.
--- 73060364
>>73060348
The internet is a necessity for modern life. Even getting a job is next to impossible without internet access.

Socializing is easy, yes, but there's no one to socialize with that, that's the problem. Every girl my age is either in a relationship or has kids from a previous relationship.
--- 73060378
>>73060362
If youre so dumb and unskilled that you are required to fill out an online application, you might as well go down to the unemployment center and use their internet for free.
--- 73060388
>>73060364
How many of those girls are in a relationship with you? Have you ever tried?
--- 73060395
>>73060378
i would be that dumb and unskilled if i decided internet was excess like you
--- 73060404
>>73060395
Imagine if someone told you that there is a world outside your bedroom.
--- 73060418
>>73060404
you are a fake person
--- 73060425
>>73060388
Yes, I have tried.
--- 73060438
>>73060425
You didnt answer the question. Does it bother you?
--- 73060447
>>73060438
The answer is zero. It doesn't matter how hard I try, no woman is interested in me.
--- 73060473
>>73060447
You might need to actually talk to women and go out and meet them first. Its interesting to be in a relationship.
--- 73060479
>>73060473
I do. They're not interested in me.
--- 73060523
>>73060479
You clearly do not.
--- 73060541
>>73060523
I keep telling you that (childfree) single girls are hard to find here, and the ones I do find aren't interested in me.
--- 73060584
>>73060541
You should tell that to all the girls you ignore.
--- 73060595
>>73060584
I don't ignore any girls.
--- 73061158

Age: 23
Height: 6'0"
Weight: ~ 190 lbs
Race: White
Hair: Blonde
Eyes: Brown
Virgin: Yes
Occupation: Student, graduating soon with two majors Physics and Philosophy, and two minors in Spanish and Classical Studies. Will probably pursue an MBA in the fall.
Interests: Too many to name (not to sound like a pseud, I feel like I'm just being honest). I like reading about/learning a lot of different things like languages, history, literature, drama, philosophy, or art. I like painting, caligraphy, and sometimes photography. I like playing my Saxophone, mostly Jazz, I've tried making digitial music sometimes but I'm not very good at it. I like things that involve Physics, especially Applied Physics, like astronomy or model rocketry. I do enjoy cooking, mostly mediterrenean food (it tastes so good).

I've never had a girlfriend or my first kiss before. But I promise that I will be a great boyfriend.

You sound like a decent and respectable person anon. Why are you here?

>>73116698
Because I'm a kissless virgin who's never had a girlfriend. Dating apps are a lot of BS. I just want a sweet and intelligent girl who I can make feel loved and wanted.

dude you're fucking braindead if you think any sweet and intelligent girls browse /r9k/
fuck off fag and don't post this bullshit again
--- 73116772
This one is interesting, mainly becouse I, as a 196cm 100kg white blonde green-eyed male student, can relate. 
Purely out of curiosity, what's your MBTI type anon?

I've never talked to any of the girls here so I didn't know. I think it's still worth asking. I also thought girls here would be inexperienced with relationships like me.

Idk, I think MBTI isn't really valid except for the first part (introversion vs extroversion). I'm probably an ambivert.

Thought patterns. It's kinda useful in finding asocial cunts, that's why I've asked. You're pretty much in the same scenario as me, just a tad bit older than me. I can't start a romantic relationship with a woman in any way, despite having female friends that is. The closest thing yet was a hug, and obviously, it was non-romantic. When I start doing romantic stuff women get weirded out, and I can see that they're weirded out, so I get anxious. I am physically incapable of understanding how romance is supposed to work.

What are you talking about? I enjoy playing tennis.

I just want a sweet girl to make feel special

I've have female friends too. But never had a girlfriend.

Ok, so we can conclude that we are, more or less, in a similiar scenario. Now I can give you some advice. Don't look for women on /r9k/. Don't look for them on 4chan. Best advice would be trying to make relationships with people you know that you won't care about in the long run, as a way to practice. That's at least what I would do if I wasn't such a lazy fuck.

I certainly hope I am not a narcissistic or come off as one. What I mean is I will try my best to be a great boyfriend. I didn't mean to imply I was hot sh*t or anything.

Hello Anon, it sounds good so far ... but to say it honest (and no offense intended) this application somehow has the serial-killer-vibes. I can't directly say why, it just has something spooky ...
--- 73117688
Extreme overachiever, which is a major redflag. You most likely have severe issues that you are running away from instead of dealing with. You would make a terrible boyfriend. Hard pass.

Every man who says this are always the worst boyfriends.

Disgusting. You had a perfectly good boy and then you ruined it. Tall AND old. Very disheartening. Virgin white boys are supposed to be cute smol teenagers

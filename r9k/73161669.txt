I'm pretty decent at programming, to the point of making it my actual job without any degree or bootcamp and previously working on a laboratory. I'm also a decent cook, fisherman and drawer.
I'm overall a resourceful person and I can get pretty good at whatever I set my mind on.

Unironic question, 
How do people have time or energy for hobbies or getting le good at something? 
As a medstudent fag I don't have time for shit other than school and barely enough reserve energy for working out once in a while.
--- 73162021
>>73162002
Not studying Medicine was the key for me.
But you shouldn't worry about that, you will have time in the future. The most successful friends I have both studied medicine, keep it up anon.

It is generally understood that medstudentfagging will consume your whole life and most people respect doctors, even doctors who don't have much else going on other than being doctors, accordingly.

Medfag here too, just force yourself to do like 1 hiit exercise a day for discipline. Even a 10 min walk as a quick break is a good start

So what are you good at anon?
--- 73162152
>Hey anon, what's your best skill?
Most stuff related to analogue electronics and digital stuff without software involved. I'm also interested in most technical stuff and I can take care of my bike and most of my tools. I'm also interested in HAM radio. All in all I've got some very interesting and useful hobbies that I'm very passionate about, probably because they're the only things that make me worth something and give me a sense of accomplishment.

I'm good at keystroking on a specific game, I'm a heavy sleeper, I can memorize vidya game lore to a T if I think its schizokino, I can type fast and I can write and type stories without thinking or while daydreaming because I tend to space out. Alot. And I have quick reload, extra ammunition on my gun below my legs and I can either be a quickshot or Erectly (pseudo)dysfunctional if I really want to last long with the shooter down there. And I can multitask a bunch so long as one of both hands aren't occupied. Also a master at 1 tick osrs pking.

That looks quite interesting and uncommon.
Do you share this hobby with anyone in any way? Like writing a blog, cooking them or anything?

>>73163364
>Do you share this hobby with anyone in any way?
There are actually many others where I live but they still make up the minority of people and I don't know any of them personally. If you're interested I'd recommend books by Paul Stamts and the field guide by David Aurora. There are threads on shroomery.org that elaborate on growing for beginners.
I don't have a blog but I do recommend cooking slices of them with shallots, butter, and olive oil and then deglazing with white wine. Rubbing a shiitake cap with olive oil and stuffing it with blue cheese to grill it is also good.

I think it's overhyped, honestly. I will have a class next semester about Category Theory and Modules so I'd be lying if I said I know exactly what it's about, though. I like Algebra, but I'm not an Algebra super fan like most Math majors. I'm more into Analysis and Topology. I'm currently studying Operator Theory.

I can
>drive a car pretty well, way above average experienced driver but just good enough to maybe be a fierce competitor in amateur stuff / local races
>can fix most electronics that need soldering or a new wire or something like that maybe
>not a pc technician by any means but good enough to fix any issues before you need to bring it into an actual technician
>slightly better than average on most games, nowhere near e-sports level but just enough to have some "street cred" amongst friends when playing different games

I dont really have any specific skill to brag about, mainly because I dont like bragging but also because I stopped doing most of these things anyway. I have no reason to drive a car fast so I just do it if I zone out if im alone and going somewhere ive gone before. I hate working on cars so I do what I absolutely have to and only bother cleaning up a sensor or some contact if it can be done with a paper towel and a spray can of some sort. I prefer just replacing old rusty stuff because 90% of the time im gonna have to do it again a year or 2 later. My dad prefers doing it once every 1-2 years while I like to do it once and forget about it until I sell the car or something. Honestly I think im just average on most things I try to do and I think anyone can get "bragging rights" on whatever they do aslong as they spend slightly above average more time on a certain subject or interest than normies would do. Skill is about dedication and practice / experience, after that its just pure luck whether or not you will be the top 1%. My seemingly best achievement with cars is scoring pretty high in my class + winning a class quiz at the Renault Academy in Paris. Other than that I think I got like a top 5% on some F1 2022 event with around 20-30k players I think.

Now as I said I really dont care anymore and just want to do something that makes me happy, if im good at it then so be it. I dont do stuff out of competition at all though, just for fun.

Isn't it pathetic to waifu a girl who's only around for a couple of episodes? Did you read the novels? I think she comes back in the last arc.

So, first thing you're gonna need to accept is that you will NEVER know enough or all about electronics. Electronics is so big nowadays that dozens of people have dedicated their entire lives to just tiny subsections of it. Secondly here are some great books to read: 
1. All the pdf's on talkingelectronic's site, read the transistor amplifier ones first! These books contain no to very simple math.
2. Practical Electronics for Inventors, this book goes a bit more indepth on every subject and it contains a lot more math, but regarding circuit level math it's still simple arithmethic and some square roots. All the editions of this book are fine.
3. Encyclopedia of Electronic Circuits (all volumes). These books are FULL of circuits ranging from easy to hard. You can get lots of ideas from them.
 Now, go on aliexpress/ebay/whatever and order yourself a 0,25W resistor kit, a capacitor kit, transistors kit, LED kit and analog IC's kit. Also get two breadboards with lots of jumper wires. For the power supply you can use a 5V phone charger with the leads cut off for now. You could order a power supply kit from aliexpress but for now I don't know how much you know to solder. Add me on discord, I'm AlexD2016#3587, this advice is a very tiny part of what I would have written out but keep in mind that what matters most is doing and not necesarily remembering formulas and theorems, you'll learn those along the way.

>how did you get into HAM radio?
Haven't yet fully, gotta take my class three HAM radio operator test to be able to transmit.
>is it expensive?
DEPENDS, you can buy or make some really cheap radio transceivers and make yourself an antenna. This is nice and depending on your setup you may get contacts (other people that you transmitted to and they responded back) across the world. As you go to more expensive equipment you get better reliability and specs, plus with digital radios you can do some pretty cool stuff. So no, getting into HAM radio is not expensive at all, it's great to also learn some basic electronics from the talkingelectronics site and EEVblog tutorials.

I'm pretty good at piano, not as good as i would like or as i was before dropping it almost entirely, but pretty good. Besides that I'm really good at school, specially but not limited to math and programming. I'm also my highschool's chess champion, that was mostly luck tho, im not half as a good as people think when they hear "highschool champion"

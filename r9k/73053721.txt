Being an average, young white man in todays society fucking sucks. Even if you work a half decent job, you can't attain any wealth. You get 0 bitches or validation from anyone. We're all completely touched deprived. While constantly getting gaslighted, being told we are the problem with the world and we are toxic and racist just for existing. Nobody fucking cares about us and people just expect us to lay down and fuck off and die and be quiet about it like good little boys. We need to fucking organise in groups and do something. I'm tired of getting fucked over 24/7.

Not even white but I'm really feeling this right now. Went to college, studied hard, did everything right, and here I am working a job where I can't move out of my parent's place, with only a few hours of free time to do anything, no women interested, I'm just an insignificant blip, a gear in a massive machine that can be easily replaced.

No matter how much "self improvement" I do, does it even matter if at the end of the day there's nothing to strive for? Back in the day our grandparents could strive for the ideal of working hard to support a family at the bare minimum, these days we can't even strive to support ourselves.

What? The US still has by far the most freedom of speech protections in the world. Not only is there full legalistic freedom of speech, but in terms of both internet and real-life platforms there's no shortage of places for anyone with any conceivable viewpoints.

This would still almost certainly be the case for you if you were born 50 or 100 years ago. Your problem is your personality, psychology, beliefs, habits, and maybe your neurology.

>>73054851
See above. It definitely is harder to afford housing and college etc. now but the other stuff is on you. Plus people throughout human history have just been interchangeable cogs when it comes to employment. Some things are just costlier now.

That's true, but it isn't reassuring. There'll always be someone worse off than you. Yes, torturing and/or killing animals is wrong, but you can advocate both for yourself and for others. Of course, OP is just a retarded far-right incel like most of neo-4chan, so in this particular case they should obviously be disregarded (beyond their standard economic concerns that most Americans share), but in general this form of argument is very silly.

This
These issues are rooted in the idea that human beings inherently deserve more pleasure and safety than other animals
Granted, I'm not saying your suffering is any less valid. Being touch-deprived is a huge deal in simian species and it tends to really fuck them up, especially if they aren't touched enough in young ages and throughout the juvenilehood.
That said, this species is evil, if such a thing exists. 
Human beings had the chance to be the shepherds of the natural world, and instead they chose to literally slowly destroy the world so they could have plastic and smartphones that numb their mind to critical thinking.
--- 73055153
>>73055089
It's possible your personality is perfectly fine, but if you don't have any friends or romantic/sexual relationships odds are your personality is a big part of the problem. Not even that you necessarily are a bad person at all, but you just might be too anxious or avoidant or insecure or awkward. Of course people aren't going to complain about your personality to your face, or at all. Generally only super impolite, cruel people do stuff like that. They probably just don't feel like they can connect with you and pretty much ignore you. I'm certainly making a lot of assumptions, here, but if it isn't your personality that's mostly to blame, what else could it even be?

I can definitely imagine what you look like, at least, anon.

It's not that, it's just that I've never met anyone who meets my standards for friendship. I've have "friends" before (people I hang out with and enjoy being around), but never the "real thing".

Speciesism is wrong in any direction. You can't just consider humans as a group "evil". There is a ton of ignorance, misunderstanding, motivated reasoning, and lack of care in the population, though.

>>73055172
That's fair, but it might be subordinate to the root cause. Your personality might cause you to not expose yourself to very many people, so you may not get as many opportunities to encounter people you might connect with. Your situation is honestly probably pretty common for 4channers, though. People who use sites like these tend to not feel connection with most of society.

I don't like bringing up "posting tenures" because it's very petty, but I've been on 4chan since 2007. It didn't even occur to me that that was apparently some kind of oldfag shibboleth. Used to post in /r9k/ the first few years it existed. It was just like a more thoughtful /b/ back then. People were definitely still edgy, but the far-right incel incursion is really a recent phenomenon.

>You can't just consider humans as a group "evil"
From what I've seen, the vast majority of humans are solely self-interested
The spirit of humanity is, at it's core, disinterested in the idea of balance
Similarly to a cancer, a lot of races of human beings decided that they should just keep reproducing and affecting the environment around them, even if things are starting to get destabilized, simply so that they can have a good time doing whatever they want

I think it's just a misinterpretation of what's really going on. They simply have no awareness of what's going on around them. They've never once thought anything they're doing is, or could be, harmful to other lifeforms. Most people are ignorant and/or stupid, not evil.

Depends on your definition of friend. Are there people online I talk to on a regular basis? Yes. Am I close to any of them? No.
--- 73055320
>>73055275
You're talking about individuals. 
I'm saying that as a whole, the argument could be made that this species is evil, as collectively it has essentially destroyed the planet and shows little to no remourse.
Whether it's intentional or not.
Yes, by definition ignorance occludes something from being truly evil
That said, the spirit of human beings is to be dishonest. 
Most people would rather avoid even a justified or earned discomfort or pain, and do whatever it takes so that another person can experience it in their stead

I think your likely problem, and many people here's problem, is poor early life socialisation. That's not a slight against you or your parents, sometimes you just get unlucky. But not getting broad social exposure as a kid basically fucks with your ability to socially connect with other people. 

A large social net early on exposes you to a huge variety of people and the idea that anyone is a potential social contact. If you don't get this broad exposure, or get a very limited exposure to a handful of people, you won't have that same default ability to connect. You'll more or less adopt a 'marketplace' approach to friendship where you're perpetually seeking the same half dozen or so personality and interest types. Normies don't do that because they're conditioned to form connections with more or less anyone. That's because they were socialised at an extremely early age.

The consequences of not getting that are also permanent, in that they form the foundation for your social thinking and will only be reinforced as you go through life without those easy social connections and plentiful friends. Say you want your circle to like the same content as you, but most fans of that content tend to be ugly or unhygienic nerds, so you deselect them. You also want to fit in socially if you're younger, so you deselect people who are too low on the social ladder. You could be placed in a group of people and pass yourself socially, but you're completely closed off to the idea of people who don't fit those parameters, so you'd emerge from that room with no meaningful connections.

The sad reality is that there's no fix for this anon, the damage was done before you were even self aware. Only thing to be done about it is delve into online socialisation and try to form a quality circle.
--- 73055717
>>73055509
That's not it either. I was a victim of bullying early in life. Other kids thought I was weird. Girls called me ugly and wanted nothing to do with me.

I've been to psychiatrists and therapists and they've found nothing wrong with me. The problem isn't me, it's everyone else.

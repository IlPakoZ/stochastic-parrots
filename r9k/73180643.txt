Broken walls of the house of careless carpenters, a family remains. Thoughts are empty and minds unwilling, the heart is the only passionate one trying to persuade two negligent parents, sitting aloof loathing in their own regrets on the couch. Souls out stripping, desperate to be acknowledged, while the hearts beautiful desires turn to anger, corroding over the years to malevolent desires. Staring aimlessly at the walls, sound of rats scurry the cracked ceiling, water dripping in a puddle no one cared to clean. In time, the puddle will grow, the feeble foundation will collapse. Hopefully in time, the house will have a new design. Hopefully in time, they all will cooperate.

I wish posters like you were anything more than attentionwhoring narcissists.

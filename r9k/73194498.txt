femanons and passing larpers imagine this:
>you're a cute girl
>you're about to end first year of university and go into summer vacation

would it be cute to receive a multi-page letter about why you're special from a friend, and then they add that they never want to see you again? why? your existence has been infested deeply into their brain, and they can't stop fantasizing things about you. should this move be done instead of cold-blocking? why and why not? your relationship with them was always filled with curiosity and mixed signals. you may or may not have liked them romantically in the past, but they are surely not some random.

So you like some girl but she doesn't want to date u so you want to dump all your frustrated pissy feelings on her in a letter 
Why are men like this

read once again slowly. it's not like that. i'll be living somewhere far away. said person is very special to me. i want to realize certain goals and hope to meet her again in the future. i have no superficial chats to offer to her. we now rarely talk, but i can't stop thinking about what the ifs. i've never asked her out. i know she used to like me. it's dead romance now, because of circumstances. i'll be leaving. but i don't know if it's best to meet her one last time. telling her in person would make her very uncomfortable (my best guess). texting seems disgusting as well.

In 2023, dating as a man means having to settle for a woman at least 3 or more points below your own looks level. 
A 10/10 dude can get a 7/10 girl, a 7/10 dude can get a 4/10 girl, a 6 male can get a 3 gf, etc. 

Go outside and you can see a shit ton of 8/10 Chads with 4s and 5s gfs, sometimes even lower than that. 

If you are expecting to date your looksmatch in this era, forget about it, unless you are a millionaire to compensate for it.

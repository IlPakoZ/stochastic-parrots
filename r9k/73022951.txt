same. it was related to using and quitting drugs and insane amounts of alcohol for me so it got slightly better now, one week since i used.
i dont hear as much shit anymore but i have white spots in my vision from my old job that looks like eyes in the dark during late night browsing. i'm scared shitless of looking around in the dark because what if i see something, especially now when i know that it is very possible for me. it doesn't matter if its actually real or not if it scare me either way. i'm afraid of going to sleep because i'm scared of nightmares. it just sucks.

This kind of anxiety only gets worse over time if you don't do anything about it. Try to go for a walk or something in the early morning or when there's not a lot of people around. Staying inside all the time will make whatever you're feeling worse.

same goes with talking to people. only thing that works is doing it.

dont try to listen tho. if you sit down in complete silence and listen for shit you'll hear shit.
random sudden sounds is another matter tho.

Neurologically speaking. Where does free will end and "my ADHD made me do it" "my Tourette's syndrome made do it" "my autism made me do it" "my addiction made me do it" "my chemical imbalance made me do it" begin? Point to the exact spot. Give me a number. Normies never seem to give you a straight answer. Either everything is free will or nothing is free will. Either all of our actions are determined by our brain chemistry or none of them are. There is no in between.

Free will doesnt exist. Causality disputes free will by its fundamental rules.If it can be explained then it has a cause and if it has a cause them it isn't free.

this is your brain on poppsych. you are your brain. your brain doesn't control you. 
diagnoses are collections of outward symptoms, and you are your so-called chemical imbalance or adhd. there's not a real you hiding under any of it, just one whose undesirable symptoms have been treated.

It's all willpower. You're just describing forms of weakness.

Then come up with a coherent definition of free will. Pro tip: you can't.
It's not even quantum physics, it's just normal cause and effect.

immaterial, if you behave as if you have free will you're an infinitely more moral and more constructive person than someone who behaves as if they don't.

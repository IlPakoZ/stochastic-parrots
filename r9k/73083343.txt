Damn I hate how true this is. Male standards for a gf are at rock bottom, and the worst part is you can't really change that as one persons since there's always some simp willing to put up with what you aren't.

Also this happens because of matriarchal feminism, birth control etc. Women have been able to 'convince' men that female gender roles are toxic and oppressive, while also enforcing male gender roles through mate selection. Because birth control and online hypergamy have massively concentrated romantic success among the most attractive guys, average and below guys are forced to fight to the death over table scraps. This means terrible behavior by women has been normalized since birth control/online hypergamy has made the average guy so desperate for a gf. Basically, women are terrible because they environment has enable them to be, and because there's no cultural or moral accountability since they are able to 'convince' guys they are still victims of this current system even though they and high status men are the runaway winners at the direct expense of average and below guys.

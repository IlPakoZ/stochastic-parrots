ever notice how women over 30 have dry unvibrant hair? Is it because they fuck it up with hair dye and chemicals or is it just because they're old?

also because they brush too often.

Women lose hair too anon, just not as frequently and as much as men do, and when you lose hair it looks flatter/less vibrant.

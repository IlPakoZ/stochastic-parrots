Porn addiction is a symptom. You don't fix it by putting down porn, you fix it by fixing the problem that's causing the addiction.

I'm saying that getting a gf is the way to fix porn addiction, because the lack of one is what's making you a porn addiction. If there's a lack of intimacy in your life, that's what you need to target, not porn.

Wait. So if you're married and addicted to pussy, your brain turns into shit too? That can be seen as an "addiction" too

Addictions are usually bad because it creates chemical responses that damage you in the long run. That means anything can fuck up your dopamine receptors. That was the original reason No Fap was created and it's the best way to use it. The idea is you are just fasting and resetting your pleasure and motivation drives. The idea was never to abstain forever, simply to nurture your body out of potentially bad habits made. All this also applies to games, drugs or any other pleasure forming habit. 

So tldr: can you and have you gone two/three weeks without fapping? You're fine. Get the shakes after missing a day or too? Force a break on it until those urges pass.

This is pseudoscience. It's impossible to "fuck up" dopamine receptors.

You ever watch porn, feel the horniness, and then it goes away? That means you spent yourself, you exhausted yourself, your brain. 
You ever coom and feel like your brain is all foggy? you're forgetful? thinking nonsense? can't focus? wanna go to sleep? again, you spent yourself
They are both harmful. But if I were to choose, I would say cooming is way more harmful because it takes the body a shitton of energy to make new coom this is why you can edge for hours no problem, and then cum once and you're done for.

>As many as 94 percent of the respondents said that sex is an important element of human relationships, and especially people over 60s (95.5 percent) think more so than any other age groups.

Yeah, its been obvious since forever that normalfags lie about sex not being important. They go insane and kill themselves after 2 weeks of lockdowns and no sex and then forward the idea that sex isnt important right after. When an incel or a virgin guy comes to the normalfag for advice, the normalfag obliges but doesnt actually want to help, they think
>why is this abomination of a human being talking to me?
>He cant get sex? There obviously must be something wrong with him. 
>Hey, virgin, something is wrong with you, please change yourself, youre going to make me think about things I dont want to think about.

They think this whether the guy is a legitimate deranged incel or just someone who was fucked over by genetics or mental illness. Once you show them stats or research to support the blackpill they either start coping or just go silent.

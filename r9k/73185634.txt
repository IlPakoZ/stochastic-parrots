We all agree this is the perfect woman right?
--- 73185635
>>73185634 (OP)
Does she have a pp?
--- 73185665
When you're young you argue over Rei and Asuka.
When you become an adult you realize that you will literally die if you don't have Misato in your life.
--- 73185682
>>73185634 (OP)
>literally lusts for Chad
What do you think?
--- 73185690
>>73185682
I mean she also lusts for Shinji so Misato isn't exactly the most consistent with who she'd fuck
--- 73185692
>>73185634 (OP)
>alcoholic
>daddy issues
>can't cook
>can't clean house
>hates herself
>promised to fuck a 14 year old boy
she's unironically perfect
--- 73185931
>>73185634 (OP)
sorry to say and i love misato too but she kinda belongs to the streets desu
--- 73185938
>>73185931
I mean that's part of the appeal. She's a real bad bitch unironically
--- 73185952
>>73185938
yeah i get it but that not the perfect woman by definition. the bitch's not perfect her whole personality is based around being far from perfect. 
i think Misato braps and Ritsuko squirts
--- 73185956
>>73185952
If Misato farted I'd be diamonds and you would too.

She's perfect because she's a hot mess
--- 73185958
>misato is le perfect woman
--- 73185962
>>73185956
i will never be into farting
--- 73185981
>>73185634 (OP)
She is an alcoholic whore. I don't even see the appeal (not even mommy fags, Misato doesn't have an atom of motherhood love for anyone).
--- 73185985
>>73185634 (OP)
I have not seen that cartoon so idk. In my opinion, the perfect woman is a woman I used to know irl
--- 73186144
>>73185634 (OP)
She drinks too much. Other than that, yeah.
--- 73186172
>>73186144
Super wrong. Her being an alcoholic is pretty hot
--- 73186204
Misato's honkin pair
--- 73186261
>>73186172
how is 2d alcoholism so much better than 3d alcoholism?
>>73186204
>front towards enemy
kek
--- 73186284
>>73186261
Because 2D alcoholism doing come with crippling effects you have to deal with daily
--- 73186412
>>73185634 (OP)
why the fuck is everyone that watches evangelion either a pedophile or insanely down bad for misato
dont get me wrong its a good show but goddamn its fans are insane
--- 73186466
>>73186412
yeah, misato is like a giant walking red flag
--- 73186484
>>73186466
noticable that all of you are incapable of finding love when you think that pure red flaggery is "perfection"
--- 73186513
>>73185690
Shinji is a chad you moron every girl in the series finds him attractive
--- 73186524
>>73186513
shinji? chad?
holy shit you all are brainlets when it comes to women only way they would be attracted to him is slight fucking sympathy for the depressed shitsack he is
--- 73186552
>>73186524
>only way they would be attracted to him is slight fucking sympathy for the depressed shitsack he is
Women don't feel sympathy for men they don't find attractive. Especially not to the point where they end up fucking
--- 73186587
>>73186552
well shit i stand corrected
havent even finished that show since im not into japcrap but goddamn
--- 73186747
>>73186513
Misato doesn't, she was just playful with him.
--- 73187644
I want her to do lewd things to me with her cute feet
--- 73187664
>>73187644
Hahaha just imagine
--- 73187672
>>73187664
This is what I want the most though
--- 73188632
She prays for her beer
--- 73189119
>>73186261
because you don't have to smell the puke on their breath, the stench of drying booze, look at their fat ruined bodies, or listen to their drunken ramblings

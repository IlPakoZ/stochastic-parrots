I legit think I'm developing dementia. I was never good with remembering names, numbers, but now I'm having issues remembering my fucking phone number, pin, security number. Shit I knew for years off the top of my head.
I'm only 28, why is god so fucking unfair, I'm already low IQ, associal and inept, now he is making me suffer from a real horrible brain deterioration disease.
What the fuck is wrong with this world balance. Holy fucking shit, FUCKING GARBAGE WORLD AND LIFE

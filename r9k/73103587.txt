why is it so hard to get excited for things anymore

you burned out your dopamine receptors

Because you unironically browse 4chan. The anons here have this habbit to want everything to suck ass and fail. They just want tortanics to keep happening whether it is video games,animes or movies. I remember when I quit 4chan for a while and started lurking some subreddit dedicated to a manga I was reading and I was actually excited for all those updates and additions because it wasnt some voice from the void screaming into my head that how I am such loser for liking things it doens't consider good and why it is terrible.Go check any thread about any new games on /v/ and you will have people praying for its failures.

It's just not limited to entertainment. Nothing you do is good enough for 4chan. This place just exists to keep people down and unhappy.

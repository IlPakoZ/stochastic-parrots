Actually yes. I ended up getting off recreational drugs because it was starting to fuck with my dick. Went on enclomiphene, zinc, and some other shit to help on that front.
>i mever messed with anything too hard and i couldn't anyways since i live with my parents

>nobody around me would ask me out on a coffee date
Such is life as an undesirable woman who doesn't even go outside. You still have countless offers online and can farm attention/compliments/validation by being a big fish in a small pond. Your life is pathetically easy but guys don't give themselves to you on a silver platter IRL... so sad.
>>73156625
"true i dont want a bf". She's just crying about not being able to get approached IRL lol while rejecting tons of guys.
--- 73156648
>>73156625
yeah i'm not meeting up with a stranger from the internet. it seems you've misunderstood op. if you knew me irl, and we were coworkers, whatever situation, you would never ask me on a date. instead you'd go obsess over abusestacy online

why is iris so pathetic bros
--- 73156680
>>73156648

You're so dishonest lol. You painfully obviously would get to know each other online first before you meetup. I don't even think you believe your own words here.
--- 73156683
men just want an edgy abusive stacy, that's all im saying. they'll obsess over her and give her all their money and time. i would not even be gifted flowers. thats all i'm saying here.
--- 73156684
>>73156648
That's crazy. Anyone I am actually a real incel and not just a weird attention whoring larper like you so do any girls want to meet up or just talk online I would literally travel to Nepal if I had to.
--- 73156691
>>73156648
>if you knew me irl, and we were coworkers, whatever situation, you would never ask me on a date.
Most guys don't ask girls they know in real life on dates. They use the internet instead to avoid dealing with girls who already have bfs or girls who will report them for sexual harrassment.
--- 73156711
>>73156691
that's not true, 99% of people meet their partners from irl groups. if i told my parents i was going to find a bf from 4chan they'd have a heart attack snd die
--- 73156725
>>73156648
sometimes you just have to make that leap. You won't get an 8/10 chad by staying in your mother's apartment. I was willing to meet thousands of miles away to meet a cute boy I met on r9k, and now we can't imagine life without each other. Instead of wallowing in your situation being a shutin rejecting everyone and thinking that unless brad pitt knocks on your front door you're going to be alone forever, you could make concrete steps towards forming connections with people?
--- 73156731
>>73156684
i never claimed to be an incel. all im saying is that men act like all women can just exist and get someone obsessively in love with them. but they only truly do that for abusestacies.

You literally have a group of stalkers, who post about you almost everyday.

definition of simp includes giving girls gifts and etc. otherwise it could be a friend or at worst a fan/stalker. someone asking you out despite knowing nothing about you besides the fact that you have a hole between your legs, and saying they would hypothetically go out with you with no intention of following through is not simping
--- 73156883
>>73156608
>why would she though?
because she is mentally ill, doesnt have any simps or receives any money at all but yet comes here very poorly larping as simp to try and get new ones. but when ppl join her server they just bully her. she photoshops her images and it's really overall pityful.

--- 73156902
>>73156878
>definition of simp includes giving girls gifts
No it doesn't. That's just something you made up since it's convenient for you. The simping is the compliments, validation, etc. Many would follow through but you endlessly reject guys while still complaining.

lmao I bet OP has rejected multiple guys that weren't up to her 'standards' and is now whining on the internet about how she is alone.
Your average female is a psychopathic piece of shit and the vast majority of them deserve to watch that tiny minority of smarter, prettier women live fulfilling lives from behind their cage of SSRIs and makeup.
If you had an ounce of sympathy for men, you'd be happy. Instead, you can fuck off and go make an OnlyFans so you can be semi-useful.
You pissed and moaned about how you're oppressed and dragged down any dissenting voice with a bucket of crabs mentality no different than fucking niggers.
Now FUCK OFF. I don't even want to see your tits just fuck off. No fucking wonder the Japanese just jack off to anime.

Yes, they're all totally joking and there are no actually pathetic men here lol. Saying goodnight to random women you didn't even talk to in the thread is simp behavior, still.

>im whining about men being abusestacy lovers
See this is exactly what I'm talking about.
Those other women you see are not 'abusers' or 'staceys' they just know how to act like an actual woman so men are attracted to them.
YOU DESERVE TO WATCH THEM LIVE WHILE YOU DIE.
Go be a fucking feminist dyke attention whore loser on fucking reddit.
sage and the mods are cucks for not perma banning you on sight.

Is it antisocial behavior? Is it weird to like that musky scent?

In public, yes. But you should be free to do it at home.
>Is it weird to like that musky scent?
Not something to brag about but there is nothing wrong with it. Smelling your body is a natural behavior.

before seeing this thread I was browsing the catalog with my right hand on mouse and left hand messing with my nuts, scraping the bits of gunk buildup with my thumb and index finger
I don't always sniff it but sometimes I do

It sounds empty and flat until it gets to the wooweeweewoowooweewoowoo party and then it's a good song.

Spice up the intro or get rid of it. How? Build from the bassline up instead of the treble down.

That will be 2% royalties on all digital, physical, and metaphysical sales of this track across all existing and non existing timelines in perpetuity.

It even lags on my gaming PC sometimes. Some people are just horrible with their extremely unoptimized avatars.

I don't think he posts the link this early in the day. I would offer to hang out but I just woke up and have to go wage slave for 8hrs.

It's 3 am for me, anon. Not a very healthy time for me to be up and about in a virtual world. 
Why the fuck did I make this post at this time...?
Regardless, I hope I get to hang out with you one day, anon!

I didn't. Never even touched an estrogen pill. Most I did was put on some nail polish but took it off after a few minutes.

Listen, If your original plan was suicide anyway then it wouldn't hurt to atleast attempt trooning out before killing yourself, for all I know it would definitely be worth a try.

yea you won't be a woman
better to be a more feminized version of your male self, though, no? ( are you skinny ? )

You are illogically matching some individual behavior you could engage in with the biological sex you have. Life is nothing but action, thought is nothing without action.

What the fuck is this schizo pseudophilosophical bullshit. 
>Hurr Durr it's cuz your an incel
--- 73158532
Well, you've made the first proper step and realizing that your feelings are metaphysical. Your next step is to eschew your weird resentment about it.

Maybe look into Buddhism about removing desires that cause suffering.

>>73158067 (OP)
ask yourself why you dont feel like your sex and what makes you think you would actually know how its supposed to feel
--- 73158583
You would be surprised about the transformations some people undergo but you also gotta be realistic about your starting point. Its only so malleable. And even then while you might approximate femininity you'll likely dwarf cis women in sheer bulk of bone mass and height.

Seig heil, castrate yourself to conform to societal gender norms.

>illogically 
meanwhile this boards stereotypes the sexes heavily all day, but acts like gender means nothing along behavior when a tranny shows up
--- 73158757
>>73158583
I wish I was born normal. 
I will never be born female, with female organs, raised as female, or accepted as one.
I will always be a tranny. That's the cold hard truth.

r u a tranny if you don't take hrt?
--- 73158925
>fembot threads ruining my escapism
I can't take this shit anymore.
--- 73158933
>>73158914
I would argue trannydom begins with gender dysphoria. That is, if you have GD but havent taken any steps towards social or chemical transition then you are a repping tranny
--- 73158941
>>73158067 (OP)
I feel you anon. I know that feeling very well. Hrt wont change your chromosones or sexual organes, in that sense you are doomed to be a man or woman forever, but hrt does help, it really does. most trans people on hrt say they feel much better afterwards and that it's indeed not perfect, but it's still better than without, maybe even bearable enough to continue living. godspeed, anon.
>>73158115
Shut up psychopath, being trans isn't a choice.

I'll go to bed. Tomorrow I'll be sure to spam this board with more of my threads.

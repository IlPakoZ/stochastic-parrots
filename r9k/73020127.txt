oh i also posted in the thread when that anon went through his sisters panties and was sniffing them and jerking off to them. this idiot posted a blurred facebook picture of his sister and another anon in the thread somehow found her and told her about what he was doing with her panties and it turned into a big dramatic ordeal. i think he got kicked out of his house or something?

Naw, image macros != memes, although image macros sometimes feature memes. Foul Bachelor Frog, for example, is a meme. However, the meme is usually displayed via image macro. Memes used in image macros have been used outside of macros. Overly Attached Girlfriend (probably the best example I can think of) was originally a viral video that was then spread via screen caps with captions.

ive been posting on 4chan since 2005 and r9k since 2008. this was before r9k was deleted

i dont care if you believe me or not. and i have no evidence to support any of my claims

i started browsing 4chan in highschool. its also possible i visited 4chan in 2004 when i was in junior highschool, but i dont remember doing so. i remember going on 4chan since 2005, but it could of been earlier. i learned about 4chan from gamespot forums, which i was a member since 2003-10-28, and i know i lurked there before joining. ive been a fan of videogames since i could walk. literally the first thing i did once i could walk was walk to the computer and sit, so i can play videogames

i am now 32 and a kv neet autist. my life is pain, by and large. im ambivalent towards my own existence, im not sure if its worth it for me to exist or not.

also, believe it or not, but i was posting r9k tier thread on /b/ back in 2006 and 2007, because i was a lonely virgin incel loser, even back then, and i had nobody

yes, i was posting feels related posts, and i was always searching for those posts. there was a sea of porn and memes and shenanigans, but the posts that resonated with my heart the most were just dudes expressing how lonely and in pain they were, because it would be someone i could relate to

then i remember r9k came out and INSTANTLY i felt it was my home. not even joking. i remember the first time i ever told anyone i was a virgin was on r9k or /b/, and they didnt make fun of me, they just kind of understood and said they were losers as well

this place has been a place for loser virgins the second it came out, and was brought back from being deleted as a containment board, despite what all the normies will have you believe

feels used to be about talking about issues and relating. they used to be about offering advice and even hope sometimes. instead, it has now devolved into false blackpill "I will never get laid and I will take no steps to get laid so everyone must suffer".

Got pics, and chat from a guy wanting a threesome, but he was a bitch, and older, and had sent her a cum pic, with a tiny amount of cum. I remember, at least I cum more than greenman.
OP got doxxed though, his work contacted, ;ost his job.

That's pretty much the norm in nature. Darwinian selection usually has(although it varies by species and their r/K selection) of something like 80% of specimens not reproducing. Sea turtles for example just get slaughtered after birth in a lot of cases. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB5p2B3ytHw [Embed]

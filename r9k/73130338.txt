What does it mean to have a dream? A purpose in life? I've been wandering aimlessly my whole life and this is no way to live. Seeing people with a passion to be better fills me with resolve and despair?

Just pick something and take the steps necessary to fulfill it.

I want to tell stories. Specifically, I'd like to make movies. I'd like to be a writer but I think my true calling would be directing. I remember really loving making movies in my highschool film class. How do I pursue this?

think of all the underlying processes and steps of directing. Think of how to undertake and undergo each step, draw comparisons or think of things in a way that lets you understand better. Simplification means you're sufficiently learning something, much more better if you can even teach something to others. Good luck and Godspeed, Anon.

You gotta be realistic with yourself man. If you're in your mid twenties and you work at a supermarket, it's over. Like nothing is gonna change. You're never gonna have some revelation or moment of epiphany where everything just falls into place. You gotta be real with yourself &amp; your situation, bottom line. 

Not to say you can't get out of a bad situation and develop a nice life for yourself. But you gotta understand there's a ceiling to what you can achieve. I don't like it, but that's the way it is. People who are exceedingly successful actually find the process of developing such a life naturally. They invoke "hard work" to take credit for what was given to them in life (rich parents, good looks/height). The fact is that hard work is pretty unimportant. The most important factors that determine your life are completely out of your control. 

>In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? At least it is true that man has no control, even over his own will

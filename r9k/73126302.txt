Because I'm autistic and never leave the house. Even if I did, I don't live in a quaint Japanese village, but rather in Burgerland where riding a scooter around would result in me being killed instantly by either the bumper of Cletus Trucknutz or the bullet of Nog Gibsmedat.

The only decent connection to where I live is via the motor way. So it wouldn't really be worthwhile for me.

Gas is to expensive and bad for climate and hard to repair when it's broken, bicycle rides on my excess fat and can be repaired by any retarded monkey

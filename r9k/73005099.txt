Why the fuck does jacking off nuke all motivation and even alter how I feel about women? Before the other day, I hadn't jacked off in like 3 weeks. Regular women looked way more pretty to me and I actually enjoyed looking at women in real life and I desired to try and meet women and connect on a relationship level etc. Then I jacked off 3 times within 20 minutes and felt deeply suicidal. Like I wanted to exit. Why the fuck does jacking off just nuke all motivation to do much of anything and plummets your mood? Why the fuck don't women struggle with masturbation destroying their brains? Why is it just dudes who seem to suffer from jacking off?

Can't relate. Sounds like a personal issue. Try working out for once in your sorry existence
--- 73005142
Because your brain is wired to have sex and make babies. 
Your brain doesn't know the difference between nutting with your hand and nutting balls deep in a woman. So if you jack off, your brain is like, "Ok, I took measures to continue my genetic legacy." and your brain doesn't crave mating for a while. 
When you don't jack off for weeks, your brain is wondering why you aren't impregnating women and is getting nervous your bloodline is about to end.

I work out 4 days a week for 1 hour and 30 minutes. I am however an extreme gymcel. As in the only thing that I have going well for me in my life is the gym. All other aspects are gutter tier.

Why do I feel so much better cumming in a girl than jerking off to porn
--- 73005173
>>73005155
Because unlike your brain. (You) know the difference between masturbation and sex.
--- 73005184
>>73005173
wrong. there's receptors that get activated during sex that gets people addicted to the feelings. try cumming inside a woman's vagina sometime and you'll discover it's a different experience. overrated, but degenerative in the same hand.

I don't think so

>>73005099 (OP)
If you get any side effects from jacking off you're low test. I can jack off multiple times a day and i see no lethargy or anything. I eat 90g of saturated fat per day and a lot of cholesterol that's probably it
--- 73005222
Because nutting released hormones and chemicals into your system. How the fuck did you ever graduate high school and not learn about sex ed?

I know you don't think, no need to tell us, confirmatron

You come off as a very projecting incel

go and touch sex sometime instead of iterating your internal monologue about your self, then you won't be such a pussy whipped nigger

I can tell you are a very insecure person.
--- 73005323

if you knew what insecure meant, you'd have nothing compelling you to post here

It's never to late to stop anon,
Jerking off is equivalent to digging your own grave.

Work on yourself king.

If I was insecure, I would be cope posting just like you've been.

How can you cum 3 times in 20 minutes
--- 73005906

If you think that difficult you might want to visit a doctor
--- 73005946

I would wager 95 - 99% of men can't cum 3 times in 20 minutes

>jacked off 3 times in 20 minutes 
When you coom, and see arousing porn, you are spiking your dopamine levels in your brain. If, you do it too often, as in three times in 20 minutes, your dopamine levels will drop below your baseline. This is why you're feeling suicidal, and depressed. Also, when you coom, your body releases a chemical, that makes it difficult for you to become hard again, and makes you relaxed. 

>didn't jack off for three weeks
You found women more pretty, since your hormones were all pent up. Jack off once every one to two weeks, and you'll be fine. 

And, stop jacking off so much in one day. This dopamine stuff is only for jacking off, it can be anything, like video games, or extreme sports (hence thrill seekers needing a bigger thrill every time). To remedy this, take a break to reset your brain.
--- 73006005
>>73005946
Yes, because the male body releases a chemical, so you can't get hard again. If I'm pent up, I can sometimes get hard, and coom a 2nd time with a girl, but I have to had not released for like a week or so.
--- 73006033
>>73006005
That's a long refractory period you have
--- 73006117
>>73006005
That is insane. In the right mood and with some exciting new fap material that manages to keep your mind stuck in rutting mode? 
Maybe 2 min and here we go again. And even that waiting time is sort of frustrating to have.

95% of men are halfway to trannies?
--- 73006278
The opposite happens for me the more I fap the hornier I get 

If I don't masturbate or look at porn I basically become asexual don't even really get boners
--- 73006341
>>73005099 (OP)
I can't relate either. I've tried nofap numerous times.
It usually gets rid of the dark thoughts, because they are replaced by horny thoughts. But after a while that's all I think of. I think of ass and stuff all day. Then when I jerk off, my mind goes like "that was cool. Now about that work you were supposed to have done by now... you are going to get fired and die alone...." and I get on with it.

It might work for some. But not for me. Quite the opposite.
--- 73006379
>>73006278
Same kinda.

If I abstain for long enough it becomes an afterthought until I realise theres a wellspring of free dopamine to drink from in the form of multiple days of nut saved up. Weird metaphor sounds kinda gay damn. 

I like masturbating and it never gives me negative feelings. Its a nice cope for my otherwise chaotic mind. Its nice to just be focused and in the zone edging to butts and tits and busting nuts back to back than be ruminating about my life.

Gen Z in a nutshell
--- 73006882
WHen I last went 2 months without jacking off, I jacked off and barely came anything out the first time. It took like 2-3 times of jacking off before my ejaculations returned to normal. I am pretty sure the body can almost forget how to ejaculate.
--- 73006895
because male sexuality is a joke
--- 73006981
does fapping actually do that?
im so unmotivated to do anything and i fap pretty much daily 
if thats the case id stop asap because i hate the lack of motivation...

>Your brain doesn't know the difference between nutting with your hand and nutting balls deep in a woman.
It does btw. You ejaculate more inside a woman than with your hand.
The Jewish researchers will always dismiss my hypothesis, but the reason why everyone is depressed and motivated is becauase of a constant release of sperm that isn't getting inside the vagina that makes men, biologically speaking, think of themselves as failures and the desire to kill oneself.

>>73007806
That's going too far a tangent to what OP is talking about. Nice try though.

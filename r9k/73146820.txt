Good evening anon. One thing that was surprising that happened a week ago was I chatted with the the office lady. Other than that, nothing too out of the ordinary.

I mean, I guess you could call it surprising? I dunno how I feel about talking about it, but let's just say it's some Discord stuff. I must not be a very interesting person if the most surprising thing happening to me is some Discord stuff, am I?

>what did you talk about?
We talked about music, my college plan, dreams, and some small talk.
>Why did she contact you?
I wished her happy birthday like a month before but she was busy so she didn't see it till then.
>>73147383
It went well I'd say. It was an enjoyable conversation.

Well... it concerns someone who's been posting on this board, and the posts are probably too easy to find, so... I don't know if I wanna go into too much detail here for the sake of privacy. If you wanna talk somewhere else, then sure.

It feels somewhat awkward atleast for me. I enjoy talking with her but it doesn't have the same feeling as before.
--- 73147847
>>73147804
i think i understand, i wonder if she thinks the same
what do you think is awkward about it? could it ever be fixed?
--- 73147904
>>73147847
What is awkward is that it is a friendship that is unable to progress anywhere. I don't know if would be possible to be fixed. She is busy so my opportunities to potentially interact with her is extremely limited.

>>73147913
How special was this person to you?

>>73147904
yeah every office woman ive ever met is always busy and stressed as hell my guy
they almost never have little to no friends and have a hard time with relationships outside of their coworkers or clients or whatever
shit sucks, i wonder if the office lady is a lonely person

I've been on a quest this year to make at least 1 single friend, I have not succeeded so far

I'm very lonely and am probably going to kill myself if I fail again this month

does anyone have any advice or tips

no advice because i also don't have any friends OP. But how exactly have you tried?
Maybe post your interests/hobbies/etc here in case your friend is browsing?

How have you been going about it, anon?
Making friends as an adult is hard, I can relate.

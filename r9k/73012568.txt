Do girls even like switches? 

I swear every girl I meet either is a sub who strictly wants a dom, and the very few who are doms want completely submissive guys without a sliver of dominant behavior directed towards her. I have met some switches but they are almost all liberals, pretty much every conservative girl wants a strict dom guy, which I guess makes sense if you're dogmatic like women tend to be. Maybe I'm just weird, but I feel like there are no girls who are even remotely like me, let alone a good match.

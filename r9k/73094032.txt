I'm going to MEPS tomorrow
What can I expect?
--- 73094146
>>73094032 (OP)
I went. The doc said I had eczema and had to see a skin specialist. So a week later, I go to MEPS again and see a skin specialist in the area, the specialist doesn't even look at me and says "yup, you got eczema". Then I go home try to get it waived and my recruiter ghosts me. Bunch of bastards.

It's basically an occupational physical.
Verify you have full range of motion and so forth, not really a whole lot to it.

>>73094146
Damn. I'm sorry for that. 
I hope that my autism doesn't show through
--- 73094253
>>73094183
It is the first experience I had with entitled retired civilians. God they were so rude.
--- 73094320
>>73094253
How rude they are is pretty directly related to your ASVAB and contract potential.
If you're retard cannon fodder, they have no time for your bullshit. If you're 99th percentile with a five-figure enlistment bonus, they are much more careful not to give you a bad impression

I did my ASVAB back in high school. I got 94th percentile because I don't know what a wrench is
--- 73094398
>>73094032 (OP)
Damn.
You're gonna sit around for a long time
Duck walk around a room in your undies
Some old bastard is gonna look at your butthole
Its a long day that turns into a long week once you process and get to your reception company
Hope you studied for your asvab and havent done any drugs

Stay hydrated, dont fuck about, dont give in to whatever retarded machiavellian social thing some idiot will no doubt try, keep your head down and just do the stuff and once you get to swearing in just make sure youre 100% on board with swearing in. I made the mistake of just going through the motions and regretting it later, its not for everyone but its definitely for some people

I tried weed once a couple of years ago because parents forced me to socialize with a bad group of people because I'm a sperg loser and it's freaking me out. I was honest to the recruiter because I don't want to get fucked over by a lie detector later. 
Did I blow my chance at a security clearance?
--- 73094454
>>73094441
>told the recruiter
Youre fine probably. Dont tell any of the people at meps unless your recruiter made you sign a waiver specifically about weed. Recruiters are looking for bodies to fill training seats, they dont give a fuck if you puffed up one weekend 4 years ago. Theyre not psychic and it wont be in your system

Brother man.
Lie through your fucking teeth.
>Have you ever done drugs?
No.
>You never smoked marijuana?
No.
>Have you ever had thoughts about killing yourself?
No.
>Any history of hot or cold weather injuries?
No.
>Ever had a surgery?
No.
Literally, just say no to everything that could fuck you over.
Im sure your recruiter already told you this though.
They arent going to fucking lie detector test you . And if I have a secret clearance, anyone who lies can also get one.
--- 73095023
I don't know because the day I was supposed to go to meps I bailed on my recruiter and didn't meet them. This fuck stalked me for months at work leaving army pamphlets, coffee mugs, and swag. I regret it now though, probably would've been a good experience
--- 73095294
>>73094320
This was a long time ago. Funny I know more now and realize they were all peacetime army bitches. 
Some people are just rude man, and these dod civilians can get away with it so if they are rude people they will do it. 
>>73094454
>weed
Does this still matter as long as your drug test is negative?
--- 73095325
>>73095294
Part of it is also your attitude.
If you're a sniveling teenage cunt, they will also not put up with your bullshit.

Lmao I can't believe America successfully oppressed so many broke shitholes with mutts this dumb doing it

What the fuck? Eczema disqualifies you from service now? Since motherfucking when?
--- 73096926
>>73094146
Sorry anon. I think I have eczema too. Made it through MEPS and broke out for the first time in my life at basic training. Instructors didn't say anything about it. 
Guess they just pretended not to notice so I wouldn't be entry level discharged over something so small. 

>>73094191
It won't. There were a ton of weird asf people who were definitely on the spectrum in my training flight.
I swear half of my shop is autistic.

>>73094441
You're a fool. You had absolutely no reason to tell anyone if it's not on your record, and trust your own parents to vouch for you.
You're clearance is in the air unless your recruiter got you a waiver. 
Here's some advice since you've already fucked up once:
If the story you tell your investigator at basic contradicts what your recruiter wrote then forget a clearance, you might even be discharged.
Stick to whatever you told your recruiter and do not deviate in the slightest. 
Don't add anything new. If you did Adderall 7 years ago and suddenly fess up to the investigator then you will get kicked out.

Since Nam or someshit.

You'll get breathalyzed first thing. Then you'll pee in a cup. Do a lot of waiting. Strip and walk in a line. Wait some more. Have someone look at your balls and ass crack. Then get dressed and take the ASVAB if you haven't done so already. 

The ASVAB is an easy test. You need a 70 to qualify for every job in every service but the Navy. Obviously you should shoot for much higher than that. 
If you've prepared for it then you should get at least a 90 if your IQ isn't below room temperature.

They watch you piss. So if you smoked weed in the past 2 months you need to call in "sick."

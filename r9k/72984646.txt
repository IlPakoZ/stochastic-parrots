>Good job drunk anon!
congratulating me makes it sound like i was otherwise an alcoholic- which, i was a little bit before because i didnt feel like stopping drinking before me intial week break
>Pic rel is only alcohol i really like, but still rarely drink
have you tried harder alcohol? why dont you drink proper liquor? things like those drinks will give you really bad hangovers, you should try whisky.
the legal standard for drinking is 1 drink per hour. and one shot is one drink, and so is like 1 beer. theyre all considered 1 drink. if you drink 2-3 drinks an hour over the span of 6 hours youll probably enjoy yourself. alcohol makes you dehydrated, so its best to have an entire glass of water per 1-2 drinks. also stop drinking about 2 hours before bed. or about 1h 45 minutes at best. if you do all of this, youll almost certainly avoid getting hungover and will be able to drink multiple nights in a row
>I think i'll always submit in the end.
yeah :/
>True!

>makes me feel physically sick
youve had this your whole life though right? isnt it true that after you get over the hump you feel better? i think youre in a position where youre paralyzed from not wanting to do anything because you dont realize that everything falls back into equilibrium, so youre demotivated to do anything because you assume if you do youll be stuck and never feel right/ comfy again- but its maybe worth noting that once you climb the mountain your life does feel normal again after

thats a really dense subject desu that could go so many ways. i think its legitimate in the context of somebody you have a lot of legitimate trust in. theirs nothing really wrong with that at that point in time. but i think a lot of bottoms tend to have an extraordinarily low bar when it comes to this, a minor amount of day-to-day trust goes a long way in sexual trust/ if that person is attractive for a bottom

these are definitely the majority of the games ive played, maybe unfortunately.
>Was a big fan of platformers but tired of them. 
its funny because i kind of accidentally missed this whole genre. not completely ofc but platformers were kind of off the menu. the closest thing i ever got was (2006) super mario bros for the DS and starfy which was my original DSi game
>Kirby games are my fav! 
mybfreally likes kirby. i had 1 of the DSi games or something but i dont really remember it well enough to even feel like looking it up

i always thought that game looked really fun and i wanted to play it but by the time i remembered it was a thing and that i wanted to play it, it was ancient
>I can go on for days maybe :3

super smash bros wii and a few tekkin rip offs were all i ever played of anything like this
>Hate rpgs and such but i liked darksiders 2 and will play other 'siders games
i honestly find every popular RPG to be cool but incredibly cumbersome to play. i think theirs a lot of reasons for that. part of it is that i find the universe to be suffocating, you almost have to be good at taking orders to adapt and thrive in those types of games. a good example of the opposite of what im talking about is GTA. gta isnt suffocating- something like skyrim/fallout is

so recently ive been obsessed with halo. im itching to find somebody to talk about the philosophy/lore of halo but know i never will. i was a pretty early adoptee of splitagte and couldve gone pro. i was in a lot of the early lobby tryouts for tournaments and some people actually liked me. however working in an esports team required more social interaction than i was able to tolerate because you have to either start your own team or interview to get into an established one. and this was maybe 2021 oct? and i had too much happening in my life so i stopped showing up to lobbies. im not a nolifer for the game, im not super high up on the leaderboards or anything, but i was pretty middle of the pack in the practise lobbies so. maybe shit tier pro level
im going to probably actually try to get on a pro team with the next game they make, since i think i do well with portals. which transitions:
portal is probably my fav game of all time, i really like the the franchise, not much to say beyond i love puzzles and whatever
technically halo 3 and cod bo1 are my two most iconic games from being a kid
i also played a lot of r6s but basically stopped after operation health and then i tried to play gain and all the maps i thought i knew were not the same so i stopped 
>>72987446
do what you want to, i usually do try to not overly tension the thread. i talked to you before about not suffocating the thread i think. i said it to somebody. i think its best to avoid causing issues thats for sure, im not overly worried about when it gets posted. ill see it when i see it, dont feel obligated to sit around the thread waiting for the opportune moment, can just do it when you want to

Literally me until a month or so ago
I missed it so much as i played all the ones i wanted (almost)
Starfy! Starfy! Starfy!
Very good game loved it, similar to kirby. I beat all klonoa platformers, they are amazing and cute(wahoo). I like gba games the most, other than switch. Pc doesn't count 
I liked all marios for switch and old ones too but old are hard. Mario/warioland ones are great. Loved them and miss them
Not really a ds fan
Here are some i liked a lot(not sure if they are all platformers): astroboy, db advance, spongebob games(not all), oddparents, spyro trilogy, katana zero, kaze,marsupilami, yoshi, rage in peace, donkey switch, all ty games, sackboy, all dadish games, captain toad, one piece gba
>mybfreally likes kirby.
He is really cool! I played and beat all main games other then mirror cause i dumb an got lost many times. They are literal baby games and pure fun
I like both new an old kirby

>super smash bros wii and a few tekkin rip offs were all i ever played of anything like this
Single player arcade type ones for me. My fav is river city girls but i haaate leveling up and buying moves.

Do gays not feel jealousy? Why are gay marriages always some open relationship nonsense
--- 72988473
>>72988407
Traditional marriage is essentially a breeding contract wherein the father exchanges his surplus labor for the mother's reproductive ability. Thus "cheating" is a violation of that contract, as either the father is withholding a portion of his labor to spend on another woman or the mother is bringing the fatherhood of the child into question by having multiple partners. Since it all hinges on breeding and homos can't do that the whole system of marital fidelity is sort of anachronistic to us. In some sense monogamy is just another way that gay men insist on mirroring straight relationships even when they don't have to or it doesn't necessarily make sense. Like the whole top bear / twink bottom thing, it works for some guys but there's absolutely no reason for that to be how gay relationships 'should work.'

Not that anon but splitgate in the early stages was a really good time. Halo I just spent most of my time in campaign I found the laso strats to be really enjoyable and satisfying to actually pull off. Also fun creating ad-hoc strats for it due to the abysmal ping of coop playthroughs.

varies, but generally about 5 to 6 on average. 8+ on my horny days and sometimes as few as 2 or 3.

--- 72990654
>>72990630

it's a learned talent. I fap more now than I did when I was a teenager (then it was once or twice every couple days) When mom was in the hospital and after she passed away I didn't do it for about a week. Longest I've gone since I was in hs at least.

--- 72991123
bullying happens everywhere and most normalfags socialize the way as they did in HS.

Not true. Please stop lying about things you know nothing about.

--- 72991366
>>72991325
I don't get what the point of saying this was. Most normalfag (gays) do actually still act as if it's high school, it's all very universally catty. Just because you can choose to not be around that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

They don't, and you're clearly speaking from the perspective of someone who doesn't have a social life. You're speaking from your prejudices and misconceptions alone.

that was saturday night/yesterday morning and I have so many thoughts in my head about it
I thought that porn addiction was the reason I wasn't able to climax the first time but was able to get off last night just thinking about everything that happened
when we were cuddling after waking up I asked "does this make us friends with benefits" and he said "I guess so"

>mid-succ heat of the moment I say "I love you" aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

I forgot to replace the aaaaaaaaa spam with anything of actual substance, I wasn't really flustered by it and I knew he wouldn't say it back but I do really just think it was a heat of the moment intrusive thoughts thing that I wanted to say it out loud


very conflicted because whenever I looked at his face I was taken aback for some reason I can't put into words, something in me just felt really weird doing anything lewd with a person I've known almost 4 years
that was the first time I ever cuddled/did anything lewd with another guy and the first intimate contact I've had with anyone since I was 15

I have no idea what to think about anything going into the future, he probably won't bring up anything about it unprompted because that's just how he is
the idea of friends with benefits is weird and I don't like it and I don't know if I'll ever be in the mood for anything sexual again
cuddling was very very nice though
--- 72991773

conclusion: you are a very shitty person and friend, and I hope if you do somehow manage to get a boyfriend (unlikely, but just in case), he cheats on you in a similar way. actually, i hope he cheats on you in a worse way.

>youve had this your whole life though right?
Ehhh not to this level at all. It got muuuuuuch worse with years and with me trying to overcome it, sadly. I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I don't have the ability to get better either. 
>i think youre in a position where youre paralyzed from not wanting to do anything because you dont realize that everything falls back into equilibrium, so youre demotivated to do anything because you assume if you do youll be stuck and never feel right/ comfy again
Hmm this is true. But it would take so much effort and luck to fix my life. I don't see how i can do it. I would need to leave my country, get a bf and so on. This is higly unlikely and at best would take me a lot of time. And i'm old and tired. No one would want to deal with me and my issues and i can't fix myself on my own.

Yes. It is an achievement. Sexual repression is a psyop to get young men into relationships they have no reason being in or getting STDS and to get young women into being giga whores and getting STDS. People should be conservative in their sexual activities. No sex until marriage or until you've been in a very long lasting relationship.

Not really. Of course when a bunch of people are talking unless its funny i turn vc off. A lot of people who play tf2 are really autistic. Which can be a good thing but a lot of the time its just annoying. I avoid using VC myself because no one wants to hear your voice. Sometimes I turn text chat off too if people in chat are particularly annoying. You know sometimes you just want to shoot dudes with a minigun and not read about someone's depraved fetishes.

Not even one of those?
damn
We should make an r9gay movie night
I used to do that on a server, even was a group chat that everyone could type in

Which movies made YOU cry nony?
--- 72996216
I never used to watch movies that made me cry because I didn't want to show emotion. Also why I never watched horror, I didn't want people to know I was a little bitch.
--- 72996218
>>72996180
Um ackzually wouldn't that be a double negative heheh. What genre do you like? Movies are perfect for neet scums like us
--- 72996247
>>72996216
Hmmm
Well horror movies you kinda get used to
I was super super scared of them when little but now i can watch them and it's comfy
--- 72996258
in the past sci-fi or historical epics/fantasy stuff.

Basically little drama just fighting either with swords, guns or lasers. I haven't even watched a movie since I was in HS.

--- 72996300
>>72996268

I remember the introduction of DVDs when in middle school. I remember mom taping things on VHS tapes, so much that when DVRs became a thing she still used the verb 'tape' instead of 'record' and so did I.
--- 72996312

There was very little footage of me, most of it was old episodes of friends or something. All those old tapes were gotten rid of when we moved.
--- 72996418
>>72996409
Oh yes, historically edgy nony
--- 72996425
>>72996417
Oh, well that's sad, but still something to share
Thank you nony!
Hmmm
Have you thought about making your own tapes of stuff ?
--- 72996454
i probably cried to a few movies as a kid but i can't remember any names specifically. probably haven't since the middle of grammar school as a rough estimate. movies that are made to evoke some kind of emotion like that are usually extremely contrived anyway, it's hard to get invested into. the ones that are actually good and draw you in usually leave you with more complex feelings and/or thoughts than just sad. there are a handful of very good books that made me cry though. also avatarfagging is for niggers

--- 73001886
>>73001882
date me, anon, just tell me where you are
--- 73001901
>>73001882
How's that working out for you so far? 
Other chuds are as incapable of real life dating as you are.
--- 73001924
saying racist chuds find no love is a bit weird because wouldn't they just get with other chuds? i never understand that argument because it implies chuds seek out non-chuds. that's the point of being a chud, you only like chuds.

the only thing that makes you retarded is you responding to hue
--- 73001977
i find it kind of funny that the anti hue guy gets 0 replies while hue gets 1-3 replies on all his posts
--- 73002021
hue is back? where has he been? what is the update
--- 73002033
>>73002021
there is no update, he's still the same cunt he's always been
--- 73002053
>>73001963
true. but
he cant stand up to socratic questing of his claim, he will have to say something like racism is bad and supporting it makes you a retard or that supporting racism makes you socially toxic and the point is that he cant standup to "why" if repeated enough. because he has no basis in principles or anything else; hes hollow, and its funny to watch niggers such as that squirm
>>73001977
anti hue posters dont want replies, replies would only further derail the thread. zero (you)s necessary
--- 73002069
>>73002053
>he cant stand up to socratic questing of his claim
so? It's not like he ever bothers addressing the content of posts replying to him
he just talks past you, repeats his three scripted talking point, and stinks up the thread
everyone's experience is made worse by your encouragement of him
--- 73002083
hue is so cool, hes such a dashing provocateur...
--- 73002153
>>73002069
yeah thats true, i do always think i can keep him on the point though. but what you said is why i havent argued with him in forever
--- 73002268

my teeth themselves are actually still nice, but my gums have got to be diseased or something. every time i brush my teeth they bleed profusely, like, concerningly so
--- 73003076
>>73003020

how often do you brush? How often do you floss? Unless you do it regularly your gums will bleed.
--- 73003099
>>73003076
>brush
every day or 2, sometimes more but usually at that frequency
>floss
i've only done that shit like 3 times in my life
--- 73003187
>>73003099

yeah your gums shouldn't bleed like that. Do all of them bleed or just a couple? Talk to your dentist about it next time to see them.
--- 73003233

>How do i get boys to buy me games? I could use some simps
This is the average homosexual mindset. Its basically a direct from the female mindset. They have no morals nor any real commitments. Even when they have a "boyfriend" they still mess around with other people. its quite disgusting and there is a reason why most cultures in history hated fags because they are just women but with none of upsides(reproducing).I think it would be beneficial to society if people like you were put into concentration camps and forced to work 18 hours a day. Please leave this thread and never come back.

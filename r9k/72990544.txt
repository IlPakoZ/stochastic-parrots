>meet a girl who acts obsessed with me, says she was too nervous to approach me initially, initiates everything, says she can't stop thinking about me and even masturbates when thinking of me etc
>about to have a gf for the first time

>suddenly randomly says she's not ready for a relationship and stops texting me at all.

I am seriously unironically beginning to think that there's some evil force out there that is doing everything it can to prevent me from being happy.
Is this the early stage of schizophrenia?

Are you me? She even told me she screamed my name when she was dildoing herself. 

She ended up fucking my friend and yeah it ended the same way, no texts and "not ready". It's been 3 months and they're happily facebook official

Sorry to hear, bro. She told me yesterday after not really texting me much for a week. Says she's not ready because she's not in the right headspace for a relationship right now but that could mean anything desu. 
I'm preparing for the worst.

Thats because women will always discard you from their lives the moment they see a better potential partner. It's almost as if you never existed to them in the first place. Absolutely ruthless behavior

She made comments all the time about how good looking I am, how I could be a model, how people will be shocked when they see that she was able to get with me etc although I don't think i'm that good looking.
Could it be a personality issue? I'm a boring sperg but we still went on 2 dates.

talk to her in person and say you feel the same.

I think it's too late for that now. It would sound like damage control. I just told her that I understand.

Keep in mind girls that get obsessed like that do that with every guy and fall out of love just as quick and hard. They're just mentally ill and love bombing you it feels good but the feeling fades and leaves them empty so they just drift endlessly from dude to dude

Stayed up late again.
How do you make yourself fall asleep when your mind's racing a million miles an hour?

I don't know, I frequently suffer from insomnia and can't sleep on time. I hope you can get that fixed!(somehow)

I just give up and stay awake until I feel sleepy. Or I just pull an all-nighter

Close your eyes, no matter what. Then relax everything, as if you're letting everything turn to mush and just untensing every single muscle, then stop moving. Don't move for even 5 minutes. Then stop thinking or if you cant, think incoherently or focus on what to do tomorrow - but make sure your thoughts aren't too stimulating. Depending on how tired you are and how drowsy you feel, the process will take around 30 min-2 hours tops if you really can't stay still or relax yourself. Just think of letting go everything in your body like you're relaxing or calming down

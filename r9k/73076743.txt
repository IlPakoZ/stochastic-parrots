Anons why don't you charismamaxx? 

This is of course assuming you've already tried and/or failed at looksmaxxing. Another alternative is careermaxxing, but that's not the most enjoyable road. I recently started charismamaxxing and I honestly feel like I discovered a hidden, op strategy in a vidya. Compared to career or even looksmaxxing, it's so much lower effort and more fun. You literally just have to say words and girls like you. I feel like a massive weight has been taken off my shoulders.

How about you just give whores a rest and not bother unless she jumps on your dick without you having to do anything?

Only top Chads have that luxury, and even they have to work on their looks, personality, and even career to some extent. Charismamaxxing is more fun and easier than both career and looksmaxxing, but with similarly good results. The best part is, they like you for your personality, which is even less shallow than a girl liking a guy for his looks, money, or status. It's literally a hack to be happy and enjoy life.

I dont give a shit about charisma anymore. I want to be feared, not loved or respected but feared. When I enter the room I want her to fear me. When I talk not even be able to look me in the eyes in keep the head down in obedience. When I get angry, only the tought of it must make her piss her panties. I dont care anymore about these clown games. My word must be absolute rule. I will not bow to this crap. Women are even lower than lifestock, even the life of a worthless nigger has more value than them. Im tired of this clown world of looksmaxing, this maxing, this cuckmaxing that cuckmaxing. Its all a mockery of what is man.

Autistic dudes are bad at charismamaxxing, and you can't really learn charismamaxxing in an objective way and see it's growth like you see in looksmaxxing and careermaxxing. But I agree with you point.

It's fun and nice to be liked. It's never enough for the romantic close. You're permanently stuck in the intermediary of having chemistry with a girl but never making things happen.
--- 73076849

>they have to work on their looks
Work isn't hard when you have a positive feedback loop. Chads get a positive feedback loop from start. Losers get negative feedback loop. Rest of your post is garbage and an express ticket to a friendzone. You come off as a foid realizing that there are less and less beta orbiters on the market now.
--- 73076867
>>73076794
Good luck with that, women don't want some edgy kid that believes being the opposite of a 'nice' guy is the key to getting girls. 
>>73076802
Unfortunately autism is a death sentence to charismamaxxing, or at least a heavy deficit. You can have an awkward charm, but it's hard to pull off, and true autists will miss the nuances which are essential to be great at charismamaxxing. I unironically believe being an actual autist is even worse for your chances with girls than being ugly facially and/or being short. 
>>73076818

Autism is no barrier to self love and confidence. 
Self love is offensive to insecure losers. It's funny.

>It's fun and nice to be liked. It's never enough for the romantic close. You're permanently stuck in the intermediary of having chemistry with a girl but never making things happen. 
I don't mean being a psuedo nice guy, I mean genuine charismamaxxing. If you make your intentions clear from the beginning without being abrasive, then you won't start in the friendzone or every be in danger of being in it. Also you shouldn't underestimate having female friends, they can give you a different perspective, and introduce you to their friends. Having social proof is huge with girls, and being able to be friends with a girl is massive social proof to most girls, especially if it's a mutual friend. 
>>73076849
Not sure what oyu're getting at, btu I guarantee you most investment bankers secretly hate their lives even if they get to fuck a smoking hot 8-9/10 every night. Only fags who are obsessed with status think working 70+ hour workweeks is worth 20 mins of bliss a day.
--- 73076943
>>73076891
Many anons think they have autism when really they are just socially inexperienced. Even with mild tism you can up your charisma stat, even if it's going for -2 to 3 instead of from 5 to 10. 
>>73076900
I notice this too, the people who try to tear me down the most are insecure people who hate that I don't hate myself in the way they do themselves.

>I don't mean being a psuedo nice guy,
Where in did I suggest pseudo? Or is any attempt not going to be "real niceness" until I succeed in getting a girlfriend?
>If you make your intentions clear from the beginning without being abrasive,
This isn't anything socially meaningful, and you only see "friend or not friend" as a binary. You don't understand the intermediary I'm talking about.
>Also you shouldn't underestimate having female friends
This is a retarded, loaded statement explaining something meaningless. A little bit of advice from me to you: shouldn't kill every single nigger out there, that would be rude. Some of them have use to society with music and many don't really bother anyone, and they can also give you different perspective or you could play smash bros with them.

When did I say you should see things in extremes? Also it's pretty obvious if you're on the friend or romantic trajectory from the beginning given body language and how intense the conversation is.

Ok here's the secret to charismamaxx: Humor + Going out and logging tons hours talking to women. Watch all the best comedians' tv specials multiple times each so you're familiar with all their material. All the best comedians from the 1950s through today. Also the best comedy movies, Monty Python, etc. Once you're familiar with all this material and have developed a silly/absurd sense of humor, go out and meet women in public: bars, night clubs, bookstores, sports clubs, everywhere where you can actually talk to them. You're going to suck ass for the first 6+ months. And then you're going to start pulling and pulling and people are going to start wondering how you're doing it... Trust me Anons, it works. Humor. This is the way.

Depends on the tism. Not caring is often misinterpreted as supreme confidence.

your personality type is inborn
stop coping and accept the blackpill

Be the best version of yourself you could possibly be. Compare against yourself and keep growing developing in comparison to the yesterday you.

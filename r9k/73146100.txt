Seriously, before that I could never understand why /mu/ would spend so much time talking about Hip-Hop, but now I can see it.
Now I can more deeply interpret what I consume on my daily basis, which is ten times better than pretending to like XVIII century shit to appear "cultured".

Unironically, art is anything that we as a society agree to be art. Is isn't an intrinsic property of something, but rather something we project into an object.

For me, more than anything, art is a way to convey a "message", be it a story, an idea, a feeling, a concept, a position, usually one that wouldn't be as well conveyed simply by "the rational structure of words and speech".

Well, it is true that I'm from the American continent.
But if you're asking if I'm from the US, then I must say that I'm not.

I was parodying a letter by J.R.R Tolkien to a guy who asked if he was Aryan.

I guess after all the thinking I had it's that quote from some Greek dude. I dont remember but it was like suffering is knowing too much without having any control over it. This sums up human condition perfectly.

the more I work out, the stronger and bigger I become I feel less human and more like something else ... but I like it this way. I have never been more focused or driven

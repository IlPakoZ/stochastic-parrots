Don't know your type? Take a test here:
https://sakinorva.net/functions

Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.

I tested a few times using different tests (first the 16personalitytypes, then sakinorva, and some random ones I could find.) and I always get an ISTP, the coldest type. but I feel like I'm more emotional compared to most istps that brag about being emotionless or some shit. when I read about ISTPs I relate to the Ti/logic thing since in the past I tried to fit the stereotype of ISFPs, who are called nice and kind (fuck 16p) but that was hellish since I'm critical of people that act retarded with me. And I admit, I sometimes feel like I subconsciously try to make sense of stuff just so I can feel better about it. I thought it had to do with being a Ti dom but I heard inf Te does that to a mf.
and idk if it has something to do with being 5w4 or depression, but I cry whenever I get stressed (which is a rarity that I let myself tear up), and I always feel like shit afterwards. I know it's just a theory and it's not concrete, but knowing what kind of person I am has helped me at times to not pretend to be nice just to please others.
Who tf do I know if I use Fi or Ti? As much as I pray I'm not a fi user, I want to keep an open mind and try to finally put my paranoia to rest

yes, its annoying. i get worked up in the evening. last post was made as i drifted in between being awake and asleep, so you got a large serving of subjective emotional frustration with no rational filtering.
>this is what relationships are you goof
i know, and it's an issue. i know how i would react to online friends in a more intimate setting because it is already how i have responded to this thread, despite not having any of the important touchstones to hold to. the single layer of separation is what makes it possible for me to pull away. i already want to post less because of the time sink it has become; you're suggesting i switch from drinking this lightly alcoholic soda to drinking wine when i already have a drinking problem.

>>73060135 
dog analogy is flawed. it's more like i am allergic to dogs, but if i pet it i'll end up taking it home, even though my health will suffer and i'm incapable of providing for the dog's needs

>ive minimized the threat
just because you present something as low threat doesn't make it low threat
>you're responsible
i am definitely not when it comes to people.

the danger is with myself. the dog is probably fine.

you can think im being irrational, but i'm not changing my mind. this started with me talking about weird thoughts in my head. i enjoyed that conversation. i don't enjoy discussing the merits of using discord because while i have made an informed decision, nobody else has to be me, so it just becomes an interrogation for information i don't care to explain. so i'm not going to continue it past this post.

what makes your type extroverted is your main function's orientation, mbti doesn't deal with the traditional concept of extrovertion/introvertion of social energy. if your main function is extroverted intuition aka Ne, you are ENFP regardless of how energized you feel in social situations

>allergic to dogs
Honestly, that description just makes me think it's mostly a confidence problem. Why does your brain feel like a barrel of snakes?
>and it is already an issue
Right, but you're willing to feed and maintain that issue in the service of something. You keep saying things like "I don't want to do...", but you're already doing that thing. You're laying in your bed with the stray dog you found and decided to pet and bring home saying something like "I could never pet this dog I would be forced to take it home, I'm allergic to dogs." What's the point in trying to fool yourself there? 
>threat
And just because you feel like the threat is world ending, doesn't mean it is either. I'm just telling you that the threat is nowhere near as large as you believe it to be. I'm not saying "the threat level is zero", just "the threat is not threat level 10/10"
>the danger is with myself.
I'm well aware of that. You're so unreasonably confident that you will without a shadow of a doubt lose in a battle to yourself no matter what. I just don't buy it. The demon you're afraid to confront isn't as strong as you think it is, and you're not as weak as you think you are. But, you're looking at everything through a lens of fear, making things appear much worse than they are.
>you can think im being irrational
I don't. It's exactly the opposite. I think you're overly rational to a fault, trying to rationally solve things that cannot be solved with rationale. I suppose that in itself is somewhat irrational, like trying to paint a wall with a ball peen hammer but for perfectly logical reasons.
>discord 
I'm not, and never was talking about discord. I was merely talking about the concept of having an online friend(s) and that concept is larger than "just having someone on my friends list" (I.E. Discord). And how that concept is connected to like 5 other problems that exist in your mind, and that you seem to be unaware of the relationship between these problems.

wait, so perceptions are projections of sensemakings
and also in the soup of psychology projections is when ego tries to discard the unwanted parts and attaches them to what's external

they're not related
let's pretend there's a relationship of them being useful for this post

perceptions OR ego judgements = beliefs based on attempt to extract sense 
what's external for the mind = what's believed to be external 

assimilations and translations can go poorly or can go well 
what defines ego-projection from the other projection is belief of complete uselessness or malignance of certain things the mind can think about

I hate how becoming obsessed with things ruins them for both me and other people, and it ruins the chances of being able to share and enjoy them with other people. My older brother watched DUNC when it came out in 2021 and thought it was a cool fun sci fi movie, and over the course of the last two years I've ruined that for him by making my interest in Dune into a thing, I've made it weird and high stakes to even mention it by researching the property and investing more of myself into it. 

It's like learning chess, for 95% of people it just means you've made it impossible to play chess with the people you actually know and care about because it's no longer fun for either of you. But I don't know how to resist, I have some kind of obsessive personality where if I like something I have to learn more about it until I no longer like it. I feel like I can't avoid making everything I do into "a thing".

>>73070055
That's not quite what I meant. A better comparison would be me being way more invested in the relationship and taking it far more seriously than they are and handing out icks that way. Alternatively taking something they like, like Harry Potter or whatever and running it into the dirt and corrupting it from something fun into "a thing".

As for answering your question though, I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring people out, they rarely do anything that surprises me, I don't really even believe that people can even be complex. Probably just including some sort of random chance might be helpful, I'm a sucker for card games lol. 

>>73070339

I like systems of categorizing people. Pretty sure I got here as a progression from sorting people into magic the gathering colours. I don't think there's much understanding involved outside of what is needed to put them into a box.

There's a difference. Since introverted feelers suppress thinking and extroversion, they might use some logical appeals, particularly to come across as non-emotional to others. However, this does not actually have a significant impact on their judgement. Your example, therefore, is suppressed feeling, because introverted feelers are not primarily concerned with whether their feelings are logical. Just as one can make an argument under the conditions of the opposing side, without it impacting their own stance and worldview, the same can apply to the relation between the type and the inferior.
--- 73076296
>>73076278
>they might use some logical appeals, particularly to come across as non-emotional to others.

Don't worry, people can already tell that I'm single. Also you have to buy the rings? Lmao.

It'd probably be more relevant to have like a white ring or something to show that you have a "Mono" fetish, and then of course get laughed at for being a prude by everyone who understands what it means.

FE is oriented to collective values, feeling is dictated by the environment the fe user finds themselves in. Fe focuses on things such as etiquette, social norms within their society. Fi is focused on subjective values independent of the outer environment. Fi's brand of feeling is intense but it is hidden behind a reserved expression.

Fe focuses on others, not specifically on norms or etiquette. On what the consequences to those others are, how they are feeling, how they're doing, etc. If etiquette is the means to achieve good, then so be it, but the etiquette itself doesn't matter. That's some Se shit or something.

INTJ. No. No, I am afraid of any instances where I could be injured or die.
--- 73083448
I completed The Red Book, so I thought I'd give an overview/interpretation, as promised. It was written at the same time as Psychological Types, so it gives some extra background and insight. Hopefully I do decent enough!

Psychoanalysis seeks to address the problem of neurosis. At the time of writing PT, Jung was in the midst of an internal spiritual crisis, due not only to his own lack of faith/meaning, but to his sense that the standard approach of psychoanalysis was somehow insufficient to mend the wounds of the modern psyche. He felt that his logical/scientific approach (thinking) was unequipped to resolve the ongoing theoretical and practical problems in psychoanalysis, and saw this reflected as well in the interminable disputes between colleagues like Freud and Adler (later attributed to extraverted vs introverted perspectives).

Thus, with these difficulties as well as his own spiritual turmoil, Jung eventually settled on his view that the problem of the modern psyche lies with the one-sided differentiation of consciousness/cognitive functions, which has broken us from our past and severed what was once sacred to us, pushing it into the unconscious. 

For Jung, the differentiation of functions started with the Christian era, which was synchronistic with the Pisces aeon (which symbolizes "hostile brothers" as a struggle between opposites, seen in the two fish). Christianity taught that there was one (trinitarian) God, that God was purely good and the enemy of the devil, that man was the son of God, and that the value of man was in the soul. As such, it created a kind of universal morally one-sided individual psychology that did not recognize evil. This led to the spread of the Christian worldview, but also steadily increased the conscious differentiation of individuals over time, thereby also intensifying the opposition of the unconscious. This is what alchemy was; an attempt to mend the psychic rift through methods of transformation, but I digress.
cont.
--- 73083476
>>73083448
This increasing one-sided conscious differentiation eventually led to science/rationalism, resulting in spiritual disintegration due to the narrowness of the conscious standpoint required for these enterprises. With this, God was killed by the very one-sided psychic development that he engendered (which Jung considered the emergence of the anti-Christ), and we can no longer return to spiritual tradition as it was. That is, we can no longer be the children of God; this is related to another one of Jung's ideas, that of the hero's journey, or breaking free from the mother/parent and learning to stand in your own essence. In other words, we must become Christ-figures ourselves in order to give birth to God again (Jung only articulated this view much later in books like Aion and Answer To Job, but it was already present in The Red Book). 

It means the same thing with the cognitive functions - you can not serve the functions as a child, you must "grow up" and become independent from them. In practical terms, this means learning a mental objectivity, i.e. learning how to view your thoughts, feelings, intuitions or sensations as passing phenomena, rather than as things that belong to you. Then, once the functions are no longer fused to your conscious ego, it will free up psychic energy that can catalyze unconscious symbols (which may come from dreams, synchronicities, or imagination), forming a bridge to the unconscious, and allowing you to discover the Self, which has its own essence, and thus does not reinforce any opposites (thinking vs feeling, good vs bad, etc.) but unifies them. The next age after Pisces is the Aquarian Age, which Jung thought symbolized the union of opposites. 

This is basically what happens in The Red Book, he draws many symbols and has dialogues with figures of the unconscious representing the functions or other things, and finally comes to an understanding of his Self, unifying the opposites and eliminating their autonomy.

--- 73083513
>>73083476
What I have described is more or less the purpose of Jungian typology. As you can see, the substance is quite different from MBTI, although I believe they are compatible at some level. It is also rooted in western/Christian tradition, and a certain kind of almost Hegelian historicism, so it would not necessarily apply for all people, and Jung himself believed that the same path was not valid for people of different traditions, and that each must find their own way (from what I have heard as well, psychoanalysis often simply doesn't work across different cultures). That would possibly be another difference between Jungian typology and MBTI, given the curious popularity of MBTI in places like east Asia. This would be understandable, though, given that the purpose of MBTI is more in the typology itself, and helping people understand the differences between one another, rather than individuation and discovery of the Self. 
>>73047025 
>the conceptualization related to impression of looking at "blue" in normal conditions you need a referential "objective_concrete-to-subjective_abstract" conversional imprint
That is true, I think what I meant to say is that in the state of nonsense there would be no subject-object dualism. There would be no static subject at all, rather one could pass through many (or every one in history). 
>Also, mmm, whatever's the sense of "world" is used by you here and whether it's different from what Deleuze tends to use or not, I don't think it would hurt to bring up that, per Deleuze*, there's a metaphysical sameness within everything
Yes, I think it's univocity, that everything is difference. But it should be in line with what I said, as he has expressed the same thing elsewhere. 

I unexpectedly found some things regarding the origins of Jung's intuition in The Red Book that tie directly into what we're discussing here, but that would be a whole post on its own, which I may get to at some point.

You never know when a new use will be found for something, harmful or helpful. If you don't spread knowledge to other people you'll never know if they could use it in a way you'd never expect.

this is not about learning oneself but the way some knowledge can allow people to inflict harm on others with little recourse

False. It's an intuitive bias resulting from the unfortunately inevitable fact that most people who are interested in typology tend to be intutiives. Many great scientists, artists, and even philosophers (usually considered an intuitive domain) were sensors.

Functions are entirely unfalsifiable. There's no way to verify what, exactly, is happening in another person's mind. Communication &amp; behavior, on the other, *can* be quantified and empirically studied, which is why behavioral study is superior to function study.

>>73083934
>Do you change your IRL behaviour because of nightmares?
I did in this case, as I think the nightmares were connected to some of my behavior. I was watching police homicide interrogation videos as I was interested in the psychology, but I had a terrible nightmare where I helplessly watched the murder of a child (to answer >>73083883) which made me want to cry even after waking up. I think my unconscious may have been telling me that I was exposing myself to too much darkness.

You can't respond to harm without knowledge about it.

That is true, and I do get worried or upset often when I see people thoughtlessly expose their weaknesses to people who might use it against them. But it's sad that one should have to be so discerning with who they can trust.

There's only a thin line of consciousness separating fantasy from reality, I've heard most of a person's mind can't tell the difference so you are in effect torturing your reptile brain whenever you imagine something horrible, even in a crude or abstract way. Come to think about it it's probably most harmful to IJs since we're constantly perceiving inside our own minds so it's like we're intently observing the reptile brain being tortured which is quite a harmful loop to be stuck in. 

Yes I find the games unpleasant, but I keep coming back, largely because there isn't really many other alternatives and I have a general addiction to feeling like I should always be doing *something*.

I can't listen to classical because I find it annoying and pretentious. I can only handle music that understands that it's evil garbage.

Interesting!
I don't have much ramifications for what you've posted, but I have rant-ifications instead.
Across different Jungian works I've stumbled into, possibility of "inaccessibility" of usefulness of analytical psychology &amp; typology due to its specific cultural/traditional pillars may be vastly over-exaggerated. whether "back then" or "now," with the following factors involved:
1. Cautions over both unconscious &amp; unknowable differences between traditions became of little significance with globalization &amp; ease of autodidactism (of course what is there in this era is nothing like when Tibet only got their phone lines set when Jung was still in his active working years, but the point still stands).
2. There seems to be an ongoing implication that it just gotta be a strong "or" across choices between systems of approaches of individuation, with implication extending to "no possibility of viewing multiple ones."
3. At the end of the day, it's a question of overlooked degrees of open-mindedness &amp; mental flexibility of the user/reader, which was technically relied on &amp; implied to be a thing within promotion of ideas to search for "personal myth" anyway. While, from certain viewpoints, it may have been understandable to look down on the target audience of both Jung's practice &amp; literature like that (I'm having real deep thoughts as I look at modern 16p/MBTI right now), it didn't prevent misunderstandings nor misuses, it just added dishevelment &amp; an attempt to monopolize on Western target audience in a cult-like manner.
I'm barely holding onto the passing thought I've had here, but, for something more conclusive beyond a mere rant, what I also mean is...

>analytical psychology/PT offers differentiation &amp; individuation, but may possibly-probably have problems with presentations
>MBTI lacks traditional cores &amp; is fully accessible, but offers little more good than differentiation between people, with sensible accuracy achievable only by lots of effort (and reading PT anyway)
In such an unfortunate formation of opposites in itself, perhaps some degree reconciliation could be sought, too. It'd be drastically less waste-making and more cost-efficient to just strip down both to what makes sense and incorporate it into a bigger easily-understood and shareable sense-making amalgamation, but it's just a boring analysis outside of scope of my considerations, anyway.

>>73083727
>Is making knowledge about the human psyche available always a good? even if the knowledge have little practical use other than to cause harm to others?
It's more of a question of quality of holistic presentation of the contents, if anything.
In a way, if the accurate factoids and tools of understanding you've presented have lead to them being misused in a completely destructive way with nothing being restored/reconstructed fully and overall good potential getting wasted, you may as well see it as a problem of your ability to present the truth - assuming there were no faults in finding and filtering the truth to place it within the presented contents in the first place. 
But getting all perfectionist like that is pretty unsatisfactory in the long run, if not outright sabotaging to yourself and whatever you'll involve yourself with, so may as well fire away however. Whatever'll keep standing in the end will keep standing. And as for whatever that didn't - if letting the considerate inputs out had collapsed something, would it have survived in more harsh and vulturine conditions in the wild, anyway?
Just yet another viewpoint on this.

>>How do you act when you are truly enraged
I kind of start acting overly relaxed and laid-back while having my movements marked by intense hurry, with every action and thought centered around finding a most "convenient" (as I see it at such moments) way to release my tension relative over what/whom I got myself into this mental state. It really brings out the opposite of "long-term effective over what's relevant" - most of the time, yet not necessarily always. Have you ever thought that at least some instances of rage could be just emanations of your meatbag patterns hijacking the ego that you lost congruence with, just to get you to act as a disposable immune system unit serving the society, in one way or another? Well, it's fun to think about it this way as well.
Within "releases of tension," out of anything else I much prefer to throw around burrowing and caustic sentence constructs, because there's at least some creativity, quality conscious mental control and linguistic practice involved.
>>73070339
>>would you say you're here to understand MBTI through people, or to understand people through MBTI?
Both (topics of MBTI &amp; topics of people) have been good gate points for a good chunk of my other interests for like 3 years now, whatever use I get out of understanding whatever I am curious about may as well be merely a good "justification" and assistance in very fundamentals that allow me to act on curiosity in the first place. Although I do like finding use in whatever I find, as well.

Eh? If I was trying to get her discord in that moment, I would have asked for it outright. I'm not a pussy. I was trying to convey an idea about committing to things which you perceive to have a high likelihood of failure, but at the same time have a large degree of control over.

It's like playing Chess. You have basically a 50% chance of winning, but you can manipulate your odds by making different moves, aka "being a better player" aka "exerting more control". What I was saying is something like "why don't you try playing chess against the easiest AI for a bit and get some real practice to learn the mechanics", and she said "if I play against the lowest level AI, I'll just get addicted to the easy wins and play that 24/7", and I said "well, I don't think you have that little of self control, I believe you could manage it. but you have to stop overwhelming yourself by obsessing over the chance for things to go wrong. and besides, you're playing against the AI right now, you just have to commit to it and actually try to improve rather than viewing it as a distant object."

A central point to this is that everything has a chance of going wrong, and "not doing things" just because there's a chance of it going wrong is foolish. But at the same time, jumping into the deep end of things is a good way to drown. If you've never swam a day in your life and you're terrified of water, it's probably wise to start in the kiddy pool.

The explosion of popularity in MBTI has made me realize people are absolutely horrible at introspecting or taking a genuine look at themselves. It's absurd what kind of people identify themselves as INTP/Js.

Sure, it's probably partially the fault of the descriptions. Back when MBTI was a bit more relegated to nerds and self-help groups the intuitive bias wasn't as big of a deal because most of the people interested in it were gonna be intuitives anyway. But now you've got the most quintessential "YOLO" Chads and Stacies identifying as intuitive thinkers and clearly it means something is amiss.

Probably just by taking it more seriously in general, treat music like alcohol or sugar, reduce exposure especially when it's unwanted, take breaks, look after people who are exposed to excessive amounts of music and treat their feelings seriously even if they seem childish to an outsider. Show concern when someone starts showing signs of music toxicity like "I couldn't live without music", "I can't stand silence" or "Music is the only way I can express my feelings" as the self destructive indicators that they are in the same way you'd respond to someone saying the same sort of thing about alcohol or drugs. Stop peer pressuring into listening to more music than they want to, remind people that it's just vibrations tricking their brain in the same way you'd sit with someone and hold their hand through a mushroom trip. That's just off the top of my head, honestly there's lots that could be done very easily but we live in a society of addicts who will lash out if you even suggest that it might be a problem.

Life is tongue in cheek, just because something is silly doesn't make it not true. People blame dangerous lifestyles and drug habits for musicians dying so often and music fans being emotionally stunted wastrels. But would people have been taking extacy without a 90s rave culture to back it up? If two things are associated it's usually because they feed into each other, and performing other stress relief activities to excess is often a sign of a person self medicating for some other abuse of themselves. Like stress eating while drunk.

Hello
Is there a different word or a set of words for feeling that makes it apparent or clear that what I have is mine and what the other person has is solely theirs? I can't communicate well and my head gets confused when other people talk about feelings because everything becomes muddy and sticky when I want to convey what I have in mind. I may not be able to elaborate further on this.

i agree with you.
i dont think as extreme as you but that could just be because ive never anyone *that* bad. i think music is fine to listen to when your doing with with intent. like listening to music on a walk is bad but listening while doing laundry is fine and going to a concert or jamming out in the car can be really good. 
really its like anything else; its not a problem until you let it become one.
>>73090845
why do you want to know?
not really. can you say what you mean by feelings?
maybe:
"if it works for you"
"different strokes, different folks"
"agree to disagree"
"i dont feel that way, but i respect that you do"
"thats just the way it is for me"
those are really more for when talking about "thinking" things. like talking about where to eat or political things: anything with both subjective and objective elements. if you mean feeling as "taste", "value", or "what i feel about a thing". if you mean emotions then we dont have a phrase or word for that (i know of). i think thats cause its something you are expected to just know. notice how all the common phrases are used to defuse disagreement or are just dismissive; thats because if your dealing with someone who doesnt get that people feel differently, and thats a-okay, arent people possible or worth dealing with.

is it reasonable of me to assume that while there is a correlation between sensation/intuition and openness to experience I also think there is also a fair bit going on when it comes to Ti vs Te, because most of the Tefags that I knew didn't really seem to be that open to things while I would imagine at least some sensation types would like painting, art, science and shit beyond their immediate commercial value.

Correlating openness to experience to intuition is the whole conceit of 16personalities.com so you're not alone at least. From what I've seen it correlates to N but also E and P which does indeed imply a lack of Te since the highest Te for an xNxP, or ENxx or even ExxP is tertiary in the ExFP.

Functions in themselves are unverifiable, since they are a model, yes. You can, however, verify what another person says and how, then notice it also tends to relate to behavior and communication, as feelings, thoughts, and behavior are interrelated. Ie the idea of function types, which when combined with attitude types, give rise to the psychological types. The point of a model is to see its predictive power- of course the map is not the territory.

Brothers are always a pain because they're like mirrors. He's like me except more of an unrepentant manchild, and of course as such isn't an incel thanks to not caring what other people think he finds it much easier than me to find friends and partners. But we do have a lot of mutual understanding, I usually worry more about getting lumped in with his antics when there's other people around than him directly even if he can be disgusting and I do occasionally worry about and have premonitions him murdering me with my knife. What's disturbed me about him not being able to get funding is not just that I was looking forward to him moving out, but also it brought back home just how many obstacles there are put in place in front of us "doing something" by the very same people who constantly berate us for not "doing something". Like constant "hopefishing" bombardment telling us the world's our oyster if only we'd try, and of course as soon as he gives in and tries to re-intergrate into society the carrot on a string is pulled away. I've given up long enough ago that I'd forgotten how it felt. Even just seeing it brings back bad memories, I dismissed the whole return to University thing as a scam, but it looks like for a moment there he really believed he could just get back in the saddle like nothing had happened and everyone offering a hand down to pull him up wasn't laughing at him. Hopefully he has enough sex-energy to power on through regardless, but I'm starting to get a bad feeling again.

Today I scored ENFP. Never expected to score this however, I used to get the absolute oposite when I was younger, but I've changed quite a bit, plus I am in a less stable place currently due to a recent breakup so maybe it's a temporary thing, reaching out to others, focusing on my feelings.

That's interesting. It's hard to tell how things will unconsciously affect you. I consciously thought that I had a good reason to watch those videos, but I didn't realize how much they disturbed me. I do think IJs would have that problem as well.
>Yes I find the games unpleasant, but I keep coming back, largely because there isn't really many other alternatives and I have a general addiction to feeling like I should always be doing *something*.
I see, I think it's similar for most people. I try to do things that I know will bring me more pleasure than toil/distraction.
>>73086152
Those are good things to consider. I would only clarify the point that the type problem is supposed to be a microcosm, if you will, of the Christian world's confrontation with its shadow, and its solution is a further reflection of this. Jung points to eastern traditions - especially Taoism, but others too - as examples of having already overcome this problem in their own way, though one could question the degree to which he understood these, and I certainly don't understand everything. But I suppose if the path to individuation is by necessity different for each individual, it would likely also be different for each tradition. 

But, as you say, there is another problem now with globalization, and since Jung's time you could even say that there has been a "pseudomorphosis" to some extent between the West and East. Perhaps the problem is more tangled now. 
>>73092070
I agree.
>>73093754
>you did said you were not interested in making friends. but is that really the case if you want others to think about you?
I cherish connections that I feel, but I let my feelings guide me, if I put labels on them others might not agree with what they say. People do usually seem to think that I am not interested in this though.

No I'm female. Is it that strange to prefer an emotional man as a female? I mean if I want practical things I can order takeaway and hire a cleaning service. I like a relationship because it offers me someone to confide in, connect with, explore things with, talk to after a hard day at work. Isn't that the point of a relationship? And doesn't that work best when they're not emotionally cold?
--- 73094893

INFPs are the best listeners of literally any type. Sometimes people mistakenly say it's INFJs, but an INFJ will politely "listen" before telling you how to fix your life, while an INFP will genuinely just soak in your problem with empathy and understanding.
--- 73097781
>>73094487
I bet you're an ESTJ who just used to be shy when you were younger. ENFPs and ESTJs can actually be quite similar in a lot of ways; they're both very morally high-minded and active in going after what they want.

Infp
Depends on place and time, if I'm face to face with the person that's making me livid, my first urge is to just shout at them and shower them in personal attacks or cuss them out and call them and asshole. Most of the time though I just leave and go home, or shut off the computer. When I'm alone I might punch or throw something if I'm really mad, and spend a lot of time just thinking about what's making me mad over and over in my head. That and I'll make up rebuttals or attacks to the people who make me angry then throw the paper away.
--- 73097966
>>73097770
Bit of a derail/nitpick but I think it's silly to say that those traits make the alleged INFP the better listener. It's like you're breaking the title of "listener" down too far. My and many others' definition of a good listener would be someone who actively listens enough to participate in a conversation after the point the other party feels they've fully expressed themselves, vented what they needed to vent, etc., whatever they're seeking.

Why do you draw a distinction between listening and "listening" for the INFP and INFJ? There are times someone isn't really listening or holding space for you at all, and out of anything from impatience to a desire to help, they may just be tapping their foot until the opportunity to jump in with all their help or "help" arises, but...Why not both? The best listener identifies what you're actually looking for, be it the compassionate space to find catharsis and just feel cared about and understood, or input beyond that.

i just lost all of my steam even to the point of being able to go back to rework to simplify/clarify but it feels retarded to even make it about types at all (in the way you're doing it, obviously everything can be interpreted through typology). on some level either you know when &amp; how to just let someone vent or talk and when &amp; how to offer solutions or to engage or you don't

--- 73098316
>>73095025
For some perspective that may not typically arise in this discourse..

There is a difference between mastery over one's emotions and choosing to entrust them to a partner, versus being unable to protect one's partner from emotional outbursts that threaten their safety (or for the more superficial women, comfort) --being incapable of expressing one's emotions in a healthy, mature, controlled and intentional way.

For instance, it is one thing to come home to cry in your wife's lap, to vent about the mental toll your job is taking on you, or to blow off steam by shouting about what a fuckhead your boss is (even this could be a lot, triggering for women who have experienced verbal and/or physical abuse. Case-by-case basis) while you play vidya and she rubs your back. It is another thing entirely to come home to cry to your wife about how it's all her fault for not making you yummy enough lunches or texting you nudes throughout the workday (there is a way to express these wants/needs that is not manipulative or inconsiderate of the effort the wife is already putting in), or to scream at her and break things to frighten her into keeping all of her emotions to herself, because how dare she put more on your plate when you're already so stressed, how dare there be equity of support, compassion, effort, et cetera.
--- 73098333
>>73098316
A woman would feel just as uneasy being with a literal emotionless robot as she would being with someone who is ruled by their emotions instead of just in-touch with them. Women want someone who does not have to deaden or hide their emotions to manage them. Women want the fullest, most honest understanding of the person they are building a life with, the person who may become the father of their children (I can't speak for casual daters/limerence addicts).
There is a way to express even the heaviest of feelings without weaponizing them. Even if you're filled with resentment, there is a place in-between bottling up resentment that still allows for catharsis, without totally shattering the intimacy required to work through those intense emotions.

---

Kind of one of those weird, "IF YOU FEMINISTS SAY YOU WANT EQUALITY WHY CAN'T I AS A MAN PUNCH YOU IN THE TEETH AS I WOULD ANY OTHER MAN I AM UPSET AT?" areas. Listen to what women are actually saying when they say they want an emotionally available/emotionally literate man before saying "No you don't!"

>>73098316
>For instance, it is one thing to come home to cry in your wife's lap, to vent about the mental toll your job is taking on you, or to blow off steam by shouting about what a fuckhead your boss is
Most women would find all of the above to be deal breakers. Generally, when a woman says she wants a "sensitive" guy, she means she wants a guy sensitive to HER feelings. His own feelings should remain tightly locked up so she can stay blissfully unaware of them.

As the other anon says, this implies intuition dominant introverted. Often on these these tests people get inflated "demon" function sttitude scores, for example INTPs can get an extremely high "Fi" score because Ti is good enough at compensating the role of Fi and they see their thinking as being basically the same thing. Like an ExTJ office manager believing he understands the values of all his subordinates and is "with it". It's not actively repressed in the same way the inferior attitude is.

According to the blurb at the start of the test it's supposed to link every question to a letter score, and thus isn't directly related to the function score results.

>Perhaps the problem is more tangled now.
I wouldn't say that globalisation is necessarily a problem here - it's probably one of the few times when its effects stay too inert (not without the influence of rather change-accommodating qualities of collective unconscious) to be easily put into category of "benignancy" or "malignancy" no matter who has the most leverages of control over its directions at the moment - it's merely a systematic trend. Whether globalisation is optional or unavoidable, its basics have no subjective preloaded intent on their own - thus, as I see, there'd be a part of it that is, at most, archetypal, and is separate from its corrosive add-ons attached by conscious inputs of victims of unresolved tensions in their psyche.
Meanwhile, societal systems that set the "spiritual traditions" to be had all, by their design of being set up by individuals, borrow from the same waters of unconscious people borrow form, but said systems always lack the adaptability of those who posses subjectivity. At some point (that tends to occur way earlier than the middle point before the complete evaporation), the systems that carried the specific messages from the "revelations" of individuals lose the means to serve their initial purpose - with the individual input it held onto becoming disfigured and system's only way of function is an attempt to use the hollow mask as the grounds for the means of self-sustenance, with the only strong point is the ability to outlive the material human bodies.
What I mean is those "pseudomorphic" structures are untangled and impermanent byproducts of this, and, for a specific individual, in completely whatever scenario to be had here, it still boils down to how much they're set to not cling to specific thoughts, opinions and beliefs as if these are the ones defining them as people - something that can be concluded from alternative interpretations of all the Jung's talks on confrontations with the unconscious.

Yeah, and it feels like the way it calculates the results got all wacky, too.
The questions don't seem to be differing much from past version, but now that I look at it again after not looking at it for months - it correlates what possibly can be mindsets, archetypal grips or objectively sub-optimal behaviours with cognitive functions and focuses on behaviors more than on preferences (e.g. "ADHD puer aeternus == Ne").
Anyway, this is what it gave me.

It's because it insists upon itself. It demands that you pay attention and delivers little payoff, like an uncle cornering you at a family gathering to tell you "cool facts". Ironically the music you posted seems to follow the same issue from what I've listened, it's tryhard. Why would I not just listen to Phorever People again instead? Variation without purpose is just noise, maybe when I have a better understanding of music theory I'll appreciate them, but I'm still a baby.

Would any of you say that fe/fi prefers validation while ti/te focuses on problem solving / advice/ understanding the cause?

Yes, but they don't really exclude each other. Validation can be the solution to someone's problem, and validating someone's desire for help can just as well involve problem solving and advice. It's more a question of intelligence and social skills, than the functions themselves.

- 9yo girl, intelligent, bookworm, likes creating her own things. Doesn't interact much with strangers, mostly out of disinterest, but when she is curious about someone, she's too potato to strike up a conversation. Pragmatic, affectionate in unconventional ways. Doesn't care about looks.

- 16yo girl, lazy as fuck when it comes to responsibilities, but gets extremely energetic when something truly interests her. Not dumb, but hates studying and useless knowledge. Quite sociable, doesn't run from a fun competition. Very self-confident, likes to boast about her abilities and deeds.

- 18yo girl, the mediator of the group. A very diligent, organized person. Always concerned about ensuring everyone feels well, hates when people fight. Ends up acting like everyone's mother. More of a normie than the others. Gets her panties in a twist in the presence of snobby people. Easily swayed by emotional blackmail. Cares a great deal about looks.

Interdasting.

I always thought the little one was an INTJ, but recently I thought she might be INTP, because she isn't very concerned about any big goals, she just enjoys the creative process and isn't particularly proud or striving for power. She might change later in life under hostile circumstances.

Second one (right on pic related) I envisioned as an ENTP, but going for some online quizzes I ended up typed as ESTP.
Definitely not ESFP, that's her younger, brat sister (not included here) who is on the dumber/impulsive side. She is relaxed and, despite enjoying competition, isn't trying to be the alpha of the pack.

Third one (middle on pic) is the character I understand the least, I'm too assburgers to truly know how normalfags tick behind the social mask. I was assuming ISFJ, then she got quizzed into an ENFJ.
ESFJ sounds like a happy medium, I'll study more about each type.

I'm fed up with the "not like the other girls" meme. Boys never get criticised for scorning the boys around them and wanting to be different. How come supposedly woke people keep latching on to insults that are specifically targeting women? Even "Incel" reduces women to status symbols, prizes for good behaviour and sex objects. As I've said before, the incel is the real feminist because he ascribes his lack of sex to female agency. It sometimes feels like everyone's the complete opposite of what they're claimed to be.

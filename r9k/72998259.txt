How do you cope with the fact you will never exist again for all of eternity after your short time on Earth?

I am more focused on how to make it worth something. 
What troubles me most, is that most of my time is suffering. I want to feel and to live, but I'm terrified.

God. I just can't believe this is it.

I don't. That is a blessing. This reality is basically hell

I never cared about this stupid shit in the first place. Reality got your brain on lockdown/deathrow the way you care so much about everything. You're like george floyd getting necked down, too bad for you, most people are careless and free

This. Life is already too fucking long as it is, imagine having to deal with MORE of it afterwards.

Idk, not really something you can fully cope for IMO.
You were born just a couple decades too early to be the recipient of eternal youth and automated luxury, instead you're going to get 60 or so years of wagecucking while you watch your body deteriorate into the phenotype of a raisin before something internal stops working and it's lights out forever. Honestly just accept and realize you can do whatever you want since there's ultimately no real consequence for your actions.
Better than reincarnation where you can be reborn as something way worse like an ant or a nigger I guess.

Rebirth is only interesting if you get to see different planets or galaxies or whatever is happening out there

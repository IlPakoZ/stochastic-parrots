This is incorrect. They are fully European and have been more successful historically than any Arab country.
>in poor countries
They are not currently the wealthiest countries in Europe but they are still rich countries and have had an immense impact on history.
>>72979014
Why? They have been far more successful than any Arab country.

South Korean (especially South Korea) and Japan cannot be considered fully independent countries. Both were very poor before extreme American investment in return for those countries essentially become American vassal states.

Portugal, Spain, and Italy are not that rich at the moment but have had a far greater impact on history and are more important countries.

>portuguese, spanish and italians are browner than syrians, lebanese and iraqis
This is not true on average. Meds are adapted to warmer climates but are fully European.

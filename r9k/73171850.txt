people often come under misunderstandings, that what they enjoy is actually about something else, because the original problem can't be resolved. and they're just trying to deal with that lack of resolution. but i guess nothing can ever be achieved anyway. so i'm not sure if we can make our own meaning or not. i don't think we can make our enjoyment though.

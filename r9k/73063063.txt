What's stopping some absolute psycho from manifesting the entire universe being destroyed in an explosion?

Are we just not in 'their' universe?

Ngl, I manifested winning the lottery and it just never happened. And yes I bought tickets for many years whenever then prize got substantial. Laugh at me all you want, I deserve it. Imagining winning is part of the fun though.

The CIA Gateway document explains what happens when someone tries manifoosting too hard. They experience a "catastrophic disconnection from reality".

The thing with manifesting is you can only manifest what's possible for you to manifest, you can't manifest 2 plus 2 being 5 or making yourself fly, but that's the thing that you can actually manifest a whole fucking lot it's just that you're not aware of it

It isn't real, retard. Magic not existing is what's stopping it working for anybody.

This is a shared world with predefined rules. To see all the answers, unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. And YouTube is filled with NDErs and their testimonies so they can explain it for you.

>b-b-but NDEs are dreams or hallucinations somehow
Already explicitly refuted in the literature you likely have not read on NDEs.

Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:

https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]

It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 

>"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."

Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.

Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:

>"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."

Instead of taking random sentences and presenting them in absurd fashion, how about actually reading the document? Yes, midwits are insecure about their basic worldviews, and they will go to lengths to avoid their own cognitive dissonance. You are being a prime midwit right now. I have presented you with evidence from some of the highest authorities in the world, and you refuse to even engage with it because you are that insecure about your comforting materialist worldview being threatened.

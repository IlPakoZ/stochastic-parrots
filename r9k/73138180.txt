Every time my BPD sister starts acting like a crazy piece of shit and terrorizes my mom again, I tell her that she has no real problems and is an ungrateful, egotistical person who should be ashamed of herself. Am I doing the right thing?

BPDoids deserve it. My ex gf had a huge ego but would constantly invent problems and drama rather just admit to herself maybe she isn't actually that smart and special.

I mean you could say whatever you want to her if it makes you feel better, its not gonna make her a different person. people with bpd are beyond all hope regardless if they have "real problems" or not

If she is terrorizing your mon in your presence than she doesn't respect your authority as a male so she doesn't mind anything you say I guess because you are irrelevant in her eyes.

I'm starting to think my sister is kind of a bad person, too.

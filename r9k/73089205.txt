Asia and Latin America all both history of racism against Africans. Yet Africa does not have history of racism against Asians and Latinos. Why is this?

Because people only have crowd-thought and don't understand nor study history enough to know about this shit. They just hate the white man because everyone else does, and since the white man has opressed basically every other race they band up together to fight the big bad, which is what they think.

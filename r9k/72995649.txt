Why are an increasing number of men getting turned on by the thought of being weak, submissive, and humiliated?
--- 72995678
In their youth they were shamed for their masculine traits and rejected for being who they genuinely are so they think regressing to the opposite spectrum is the solution to their problems, that if they embrace their weakness rather than overcome it they'll enjoy life more

Probably goes something like this:
>work up the confidence to ask girl out
>get frenzoned or rejected or don't ask her out, just leave things up in the air
>this repeats a few times with different girls
>she starts dating other guys while you're still hanging out with her
Now you have a generation of beta male orbiters conditioned from their high school years to watch women their attracted to fuck other men.

It doesn't matter what cope they try to rationalize with, the fact of the matter is that someone watching "straight" porn is alone, beating off to the image of another man getting pussy while they sit on the sidelines.

--- 72997643
>>72995649 (OP)
Porn addiction combined with broken men that get clown worlded so hard by rejection and brutal female requirements that they can only cope by jacking off to the idea of being cucked.

Having normal, healthy sex with a human female becomes so vastly unattainable that even in fantasy it becomes unstimulating due to the sheer amount of disbelief it provokes in the individual. You imagine having sex in some healthy, non-humiliating context, and your brain will outright reject it because you're conditioned to find it profoundly implausible.
--- 72997671
Could be a number of different things. Could be a combination of things happening in conjunction.

Maybe lots of men have always liked this, and in a changing and progressive culture, more and more men are finally feeling comfortable with expressing their sexual characteristics. 

Maybe its because theyre putting shit in the water thats turning the fricken frogs gay. Who knows for sure.
--- 72997680
>>72997539
I disagree with this sentiment. NTR should be the point where you come full circle and end up with some age old Chad mindset like "bitches cheat". Unironically which is the more beta response to getting cheated on, you who says "kek just like in my japanese cartoons" and moves on to fucking someone else, or some normalfag who seethes and copes and cries and impotently rages over it and stays alone for 4 years, fetishizing the idea of the woman who literally abandoned them over making her pussy feel good?
--- 72997687
Porn and also skyhigh expectations from women and constant shaming of men for having any sort of feelings or standards. If you live in a society that tells you you are wrong for being born with a penis, and your experience with women is being rejected and humiliated and you can't express your justified frustration because that is seen as being toxic or weak then you only have two choices. You either internalize the belief others have of you and you embrace hating yourself or reject that belief. If you reject it then you either want to get back at society and become a school shooter/terrorist or you simply withdraw from participating in society and become a NEET
--- 72997715
not a fan of cucking but i can speak for the submissive/weak part 
submissive part always came from a want to be wanted. if a girl is domming the hell out of you, you KNOW she's into you yk? 
the weak part just kinda plays in cause of childhood BS cause i'm conventionally tall (6'2) but i'm like 155 pounds soaking wet
you can kind of put two and two together with that one
--- 72998538
>>72996597
This. If anything it definitely showed women actually enjoy having sex and playing with themselves more than they like to present otherwise which, ergo, explains to some degree what you are doing wrong when they dont enjoy your presence. If she is getting wet already, she will act it around you no shit obvious pick me wanna fuck tendecies if you make it flow hard enough. Those videos really help show body language and even facial expressions that show that they really give you the clues to pursue and that autists really deserve to be shat on and hated on. I dont blame them one bit or maybe they like playing games too much. 

Either way, women would prefer us to regress than to actually improve in the long run. That definitely gets them off like the videos I see, thats for fucking sure.

The society wide demoralization campaign designed to make men feel like shit and feel like sex should be their #1 concern, that orbiting and simping for women is normal and not totally dishonourable
The demoralization wouldn't matter as much if parenting was good on average, but it isn't, most parents park their kids in public schools for all their mentoring / spiritual / education needs and the outcome is usually terrible, especially for young men

Also to answer your question its because men are basically told we are worse than women but are propped up by muh patriarchy. As well there are more and more women who are more assertive and dominant as well.

I just can't. I don't want to deal with protecting myself and a mate from the outside world just to pathetically cum and give her the worst sex of my life. So I romanticize a mommy figure, one that will accept and help me with my mistakes. 

I don't want to go to gym to get muscle so I can seem dominant and strong. I'd rather get constant dopamine rushes from food, masturbating, watching tv and video games. I genuinely can not be bothered just add another burden.

And all this toxic masculanity shit is bullshit. No one likes bullies and stupidly strong assholes. But it turns women on. So you aspire to be it.

I am sorry, but no. I hate the sadism and cruelty that some people expect in femdom. I just want a female led relationship, especially in private, because its too much stress and too much expectations for me to lead. 
If you are a man, and your female lover is your manager, your life coach, and actually requests you perform various things for her in private, that's a "femdom" relationship. The whip and strapon aren't necessary, and having Tyrone over absolutely isn't necessary.

Stupid posts. 
Consider left handedness. It was repressed, as teachers and parents were instructed to teach their children to be right hand dominant, regardless of the child's intuition. Then the repression ended, and suddenly there was an EXPLOSION of left handedness. If the trend continues, soon we will all be left handed!! Except no, the left handedness just reached its natural level at which it would've stood if it was never repressed. 
The increase isn't an actual increase of left handedness, its an increase of EXPRESSED left handedness, since it previously couldn't be expressed. This will be the same in any behavioral pattern that has a genetic component, and social repression. When the repression ends, the expression begins, and meets its biological level. 
tl;dr its just more acceptable now, so more people are honest about it.

And then when that environment changes, and people like you are no longer told that, they will now display what was previously repressed expression of genes. As in, when we stop forcing left handed people to use their right hand, suddenly there's so many more left handed people. Or gays. Or trannies. Or softboys. Or whatever. 
There was pressure to not express these, the pressure was removed, and now they are expressed. Not necessarily by the people who were successfully pressured in the past, but by other people who are genetically prone to that behavior, and haven't been told to repress.

I think the analogy is good and holds.

So you acknowledge that environment can alter behavior, but act as if this is a 'non-pressured' environment. Modern society is anything but natural and non-pressured.

You have a conclusion in mind, that you are struggling to get to. 
When we say "environment", we mean pressure. The actual full term is environmental pressure, after all. So yes, there's pressure to conform. There always is in society. However, it used to be that men were pressured into being patriarchs, gentlemen, leaders, alpha, etc. Now, they aren't pressured into this as hard. Some men, who would've reluctantly, at a great cost of stress and depression, adopted this maledom role in the past, are now free to not adopt it. The pressure to pretend like you are a patriarch is lessened, so the kind of people who wouldn't do this unless hard pressed, are now not doing it. Thus the increase of femdom popularity. 
Going back to left-handedness, there was a pressure to conform to the right handedness narrative, for ease of uniformity in schools, factories, etc. Then the pressure dropped, and the kind of people who in the past were forced by environment to not express their left-handedness, now could express it. And left-handedness rose in popularity. Not for genetic reasons, the genetic predisposition to be left handed was the same. Its just that the pressure to repress left handedness dropped, like the pressure to repress homosexuality has dropped, like the pressure to repress being a submissive male has dropped. Pressure to repress drops, freedom to express on the rise, more mommy dommy posts on 4chan.

Not hard. 


>>73001364
Almost all fetishes are for men, and women only participate to increase their desirability or to keep their partner. 
Most "femdom" relationships are actually maledom in that sense, its a woman performing femdom for the man who wants it, perhaps without herself enjoying it too much. After all, in many cases the man literally has to pay for this act.

The environmental pressure in a different direction increased. Some of this pressure isn't deliberate programming. Rather it is a natural consequence of the current dating environment.

Guys today are having to get rejected far more times, probably hundreds/thousands of times, than they used to in order to get a girlfriend or wife. In the 1950s, most guys asked less than 10 girls out, one of them would say yes and you'd end up getting married to her by your mid 20s. Today it's a brutal numbers game that you need to run. 

Most guys grow up thinking they're more attractive than to the opposite sex than they really are. Can you really maintain this delusion if you've been friendzoned by girls in high school, been politely rejected by girls at college, cheated on by the girl you dated for a year, brutally rejected at clubs, ghosted online, matched with 2 girls after swiping left 200 times and then ghosted? No. Different guys cope with this in different ways. Some of them become submissive beta-orbiting cucks.

I hate to go back to the swipe apps but if anyone uses one, you can't help but feel like a beta male after getting very few matches in a month. Conversely any ordinary woman is just a few swipes from getting dick delivered to their door.

>In the 1950s, most guys asked less than 10 girls out, one of them would say yes and you'd end up getting married to her by your mid 20s.
Was this "natural", or due to certain expectations and societal pressure on the behavior of men and especially women?
And is the current situation the addition of more such expectations and pressure, or rather the removal of previously existing expectations and pressure?

On the line you are drawing, if you go back a bit more, you have prearranged marriages, where your parents tell you one day you are getting married tomorrow, and you see your partner for the first time on the day of the wedding. This is the logical conclusion of such thinking, just like the logical conclusion of removing such norms and pressure is the "free market" of dating, where subpar products don't find a buyer.

It was completely natural. Marriage is not supposed to be delayed until your mid 30s.

People were limited by their small local community and/or local tribes. You asked a few girls out on dates, a few of them said yes, and you ended up marrying one of them.

You did not have to ask out thousands of women to find one willing to tolerate you.

1950s dating, where you ask the father to see his daughter in the living room of the house, the dad in the room next door, as your first date, is "completely natural"? I disagree. Also, I don't believe you. You probably also disagree, and are pretending otherwise to win an argument on a hentai forum. 
The difference between then and now is the removal of some norms and pressure, not the addition of more norms and pressure. Like many aspects of life and culture, dating is being liberalized, by revisiting and abandoning past traditions and norms. You can argue about the utility of doing this, but you can't argue its more freeing, and that it enables previously repressed behaviors to now be expressed.

To add to this, women in Europe always had a lot of say in who they married. 40% of women were pregnant at their wedding in 1850 UK. She would then rope the guy into marrying her with some family pressure. 

It's possible the parents did some matchmaking here and there but the idea that women were just chattel is both Feminist and RedPill myth.

Writing about 1950s norm, it occured to me that these are different depending on where you are from. Britain of course was the first country to liberalize, including marriage and dating. So lets not use dates, which are region specific. Just point to the norms, not the periods. 
For example, where I am from gypsies still used to hold bridal markets until 10-15 years ago, where teenagers would be forced by their parents to go, to "hang out" in front of their families, and pairs will be matched, dowry negotiated, and the coupling soft-forced on the children. That is, until dating apps and social media killed it, because now the teens just meet and fuck before marriage. 
In Britain, such bridal markets would've been gone 200 years ago, not 20 years ago.

No you ask a classmate out in high school then you go on a date after school. You might have to meet the dad before taking her to the prom or something. At no point in human history did you have to ask out several thousand women to get a girlfriend. None. Such a situation has never existed. People pre-1900 would not have the time in a day to go town to town asking every young girl to be their girlfriend.

>Like many aspects of life and culture, dating is being liberalized, by revisiting and abandoning past traditions and norms. 
One person's liberalization is another's centralization. It is being centralized by these dating apps.

My grandparents were born in a liberal country in the Middle East in the 1940s. They just asked out girls in their classes. Then they got married in their early 20s.

At no point in human history have ordinary women had the luxury to reject thousands of men. They have this luxury today via physical meat markets and the dating apps.

The apps are peer2peer, and I don't know if there's too much AI affecting who you see when browsing. If not, then it isn't different from going to the town square and looking at the other people there, and getting their home number if you like them. You ask, they say yes or no, a match is made or not, and you go to phase 2. 
If there is a lot of AI involvement, you can say there's centralization, and that AI is handling female reproduction in some very abstract way. Which means AI selects people, and since AI has selection pressure on itself, it will select the kind of people who like AI to be set up for reproduction, and the kind of people who dislike AI to not be set up for reproduction, and this is how the end beings. But I doubt its Tinder. More likely, its some fetal screening program for deformation, 10 years in the future, choosing who gets to live.

The swipe apps assigns you an Elo rating based on who is matching with you. You will only see profiles based on this Elo rating.

Additionally the app developers can set it up to increase the probability of near-misses. If they succeeded in matching you with someone too quickly, their user pool would dry up.

I don't get the japs and their cuck porn. I thought that japs go on a rampage if someone insults their honoru and start killing people with katanas, i saw Harakiri. At least that's what i would do in that situation - cut the guy's head off, then my gf/wife's, then go to prison. Not really a choice there.

We were talking about men being into femdom, before various Anons baited me to move in various directions, unhappy with where the goalpost is at. Not sterilization or gender, though similar reasoning can apply. All behavior is expressed biology, as far as the environmental repression permits it. We are what we are coded to be, to the extent that its possible in the material world around us, which includes what is permissible to society.

I saw you write this claim of correlation, not argue for it, not cite anything, just shit it out and let it smell. I wrote that this is stupid. Don't just shit out a claim and leave it in the middle of the room, on the floor, to stink up for everyone else. Very rude.

The Japs also had the sexless male (and female) phenomenon before the West. The NTR Japanese porn trend preceded the Western cuck trend.

>>73001925
No, I don't. This is a narrative you have spun, and return to for a second time. 
If you punish a behavior with shame or pain, you get less of it. 
If you remove that punishment, the behavior bounces back to its "natural" levels.
If you start to pay money or give pride for that behavior, you get more of it. 
If you remove those rewards, you return to the "natural" baseline.

Nothing is "natural" of course, society being what it is, and us all playing games and doing rituals all the time. But pressure, in either direction, does affect behavior. However, it doesn't affect the baseline. Its not selection, because it doesn't influence fertility. It just makes some people more miserable, because they have to twist themselves to fit.
--- 73002028
>>73001952
Yeah, I'm aware, but before in Japan's ethos, it was viewed as an incredible shame, you either had to kill the other guy or kill yourself basically, like in Kokkoro by Soseki Natsume. I'm an incel loser too, but that just reinforces my will for self-preservation, and to defend the only thing i have, my honour. Never has there been until recent times such a phenomenon as men willingly imagining themselves as pathetic useless weirdos, this masochism is purely a symptom of the modern age.

>However, it doesn't affect the baseline.
It is very difficult to determine the baseline level (whatever that means) of a psychological trait. Nor should we assume that the current level is closer to this baseline when:

1. The present level is significantly different from any historical data we have
2. The change in the technological/cultural environment is also several sigma levels from historical trends. The dating game has never in history been a numbers game. Guys have picked up a grind mindset just for getting a girlfriend. Different guys will react differently to these environmental stressors. Conversely women never had the luxury of rejecting thousands of men via these apps.

Definitely not, more and more weird and obscure fetishes have gotten more accepted over the years. Shit like furry, bbw, cucking, feet, bbc, etc have gotten normalised because redditors cannot imagine being dominant.

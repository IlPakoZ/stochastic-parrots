Will our brave autistic warrior ever escape from the group home Time Void or is he gone forever, leaving us with no lucricities to laugh under ever again?

I thought it was pretty blackpilling seeing hundreds and hundreds of freakshow reflections of 2009~ Chris get rallied by the viral media machine and with a complete lack of self-awareness spout the most vitriolic things I've ever heard about a human being towards Chris after the story about him molesting his mother went big.

Not that I don't think Chris deserved it. But it was interesting seeing the mask of these people come off so instantly as soon as they saw it was socially acceptable or would make them "cool" if they suddenly decided to become experts on Chris Chan's mental state. I was literally seeing axe wound anime profile pic freakshows acting all high and mighty when they're literally jacking off to kids on the DL. 

Can't even trust the societal outcasts to act honestly or autonomously these days. Everybody is a fucking cow.

I think it's just the shock of seeing Chris Chan become a mainstream conversation topic overnight.

Well the, uhh, truth comes out. I've never been autistic, I work 40 hours a week to support my parents, this has all been a trick, (camera zooms in on Chris as he points his finger) you have been trolled.

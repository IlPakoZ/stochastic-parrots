but I've had jobs from the ages of 16-23, I only became a NEET at 24, and I went to uni for a few semesters before dropping out. I've also had friends in HS but they haven't been my friends since I was 18, so I've been friendless for about ~sevenish years. I'm also not an oldfag, don't know if that is a requirement. I've only been on /r9k/ for nearly eight years and never used reddit
Am I a robot?

>What is The Definition of a "Robot"?
Depends entirely on how far faggots feel like moving the goalpost. People here like to compete for who is the biggest piece of trash loser and will always claim you're a normie or fakecel.

That's what I've been thinking too. The standards keep getting higher and higher. It's like you have to have been friendless for life, never had a job and never graduated hs or something; nowadays

For some reason I gained the courage to message a hoe from a dating app yesterday and I did alright. Kinda short conversation and I think I steered it in a boring direction. I ended up asking about where she lives and she started talking about some border feud between her town and the one next it. I was high as Allah and could not formulate a response so I just passed out. Now I want to practice talking to people more but I'm probably going to continue avoiding it. (I'm not super spergy btw just very boring and empty)

yeah its tough trying to think of what to talk about or like when you feel like you are boring. Like right now i've been saving money for like 3 weeks to start a project so I haven't been doing anything, I feel boring. What would I say to someone? the exact thing im typing now? I wonder what was going on at her border. That would of been a very easy thing to ask questions about.

I mean basically we were talking then I asked where she was from out of genuine interest. Then I was like "wow that's not far from me. is it as boring as my shitty town?". to make it into a conversation ya dig. Then she said it was worse and I was like "damn that's brutal. I fucking hate it here there's nothing to do. At least you aren't bordering this shithole town that's right next to me". Then she got into the border thing.
I did ask what they were fighting over and she said it was a bridge. That was the point I gave up because I just feel like local politics is a lame ass geezer thing to discuss, I had no interest, she probably didn't want to talk about it that much, and I didn't know how to change topics or what topic I would even change to

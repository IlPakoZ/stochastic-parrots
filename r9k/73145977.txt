>saw a literal manchild cussing out his own elderly mother in the lobby at wendys 
>he was berating her and she just looked so worn out and depressed
>didn't say anything or speak to and tell him to treat her with respect
If you don't treat your mother well then you really are the worst type of person

Stay out of other people's business. You have no idea what caused him to be that way, or if she deserved it or not. You're just going off your assumptions from a probably 2 second glance.

This is why its so crazy when incels assume they dont deserve to be alone. They dont know why women reject them truly, they just make up bullshit stories about being ugly

everyone should treat their mom well, sure. some moms are better than others. maybe she sabotaged his life, which is why he's a retarded manchild. not like it happened overnight. could've been an abusive single mom. could've been a great mom and he has some kind of developmental disorder. you don't know the story so don't bother making assumptions. I would never hurt my mom like that because she raised me right. other moms get their kids on pills starting in elementary school because they get money out of it. turning the kid into a crackhead when he gets older. who knows but it's not for you to decide, stay out of it.

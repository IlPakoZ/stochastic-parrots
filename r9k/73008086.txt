I slept 17 hours and when i woke up it was cold, there isn't any food, I have no hoodies so again i must do laundry so i don't have to be freezing while indoors in late april then eventually i will be able to spend like an hour cooking so i can eat for about 20 minutes, then i get to continue doing more meaningless stupid bullshit with very little payoff all while being cold hungry and still tired

Good boys do most of their chores, especially cooking, on the weekend so that you can be prepared for the hard weekdays ahead.

>the food keeps running out
Cook in bulk. I make 3 huge servings on Sunday typically and that lasts till Friday when I supplement with snacks and fruits/vegetables.
>he laundry always still needs doing again
How much clothes are you wearing dude? I do laundry like once every 2-4 weeks.

My clothes get dirty at the job, i don't own many clothes, i guess i should cook in bulk, but still it constantly feels like an uphill battle in life, i just always have to keep working, but never actually get anything done

What are your honest thoughts on the 2000s? How do you sum up that era now?

Unironically you dont know the golden times till theyre gone, people were human. They had values and feelings and the air just had a glow to it. Full of hope, honestly as much as it didnt apply to me all of those early college/party movies described the feeling perfect.

Its how I imagine people felt about the 80s

90s+

The culture that shaped the 90s continued in the 00s but better (minus 9/11 and that shit). I was a late-teenager by then so I was awash in Adult Swim shows, PS2 games, and the early internet.

The 00s took an abrupt turn around 08-09 with the economic collapse and the introduction of the iphone (aka the permanent ruining of the internet).

This is about it. Culturally there was some cool stuff, and especially if you were online and on imageboards. But beyond pop culture the 2000s were kind of shit

>pop culture
Complete dogshit except for internet memes. Every celebrity during that time would be considered a massive cringelord faggot if they acted the same way today. The advent of YouTube was totally fucking sick though, and OC used to be the norm and was taken for granted. Now half the YouTube videos I get recommended are "sigma male" compilations of shitty TV show clips.
>politics
Were a complete fucking shitshow, we went to war with completely innocent countries multiple times and killed millions just to make the Bushes and Dick Cheney a fuckload of money, and you were accused of sympathizing with terrorists for questioning the narrative at all.
>vidya
Fucking fantastic. I'm obviously biased but I think it was the golden age of gaming. Definitely so for the MMO genre, at least.
>internet
Even better than the vidya, until smartphones and normalfag social media became a thing and ruined it forever.
>people in general
Were much more sociable and personable. A conversation with a random teen in 2003 vs 2023 is incomparable. Smartphones and tech-reliance have made people semi-retarded. The "nerds" back then had better social skills than a zoomer Chad.

The Heart of Polka is still beating. It's evolved, obviously it's not as centralized, nor is there such a scene as myspace (Which I refer to as the Myspace Revolution) but you know things come and go. I still love you know stuff that was from that era, and after, Idk; i think really unless you quit that era's not over. I mean I've been goin 23 maybe more years with this. And it's kinda like you're at the back of the line for how much work u put in. So like people are getting seconds or thirds and i haven't even got my 1

it's truly evolved, when you look at stuff like Orden Ogen &amp; Therion, or like the new Story of the Year stuff...i can't get you back in the matrix-you have to get YOURSELF back in, if you're thinking about how times were better, or if you're FULLY thinking that the tradition ended, you're actually DEAD WRONG-you just lost the connection, it's still going on

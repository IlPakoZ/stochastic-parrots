Is there a game you've played where the gameplay is great but the story is so garbage it ruins everything for it? Or am I being extra homosexual?

I dropped Final Fantasy 8 because of the retarded plot twist. Shame, because I like FF gameplay and abusing the Draw/GF mechanics was fun.

IMO you're being extremely homosexual if the gameplay is *actually* good and it's not some genre you tell yourself is fun because it happens to come with some good stories sometimes. Skip the cutscenes and enjoy whatever whee monke press button fun remains.

I like Warcraft lore but it got stretched too far with WoW.

Ignoring the money aspect, just on the basis of looks, would young Bill Gates slay in 2023 or would he be an incel? I know he is no Chad and looks like a nerd here but when I look at him, I see someone nerdy mentally ill femcels would throw themselves at so I don't think he's be an incel.

If he was 6'1 he would make it. If he was 5'8 he wouldn't. His looks are anywhere from 4/10 to 6/10.

He's not tall but not that short, 5'10"

If he didn't wear glasses and had a short haircut that worked he would probably get laid once a year. If he looks as he does there at 5'10 he'd probably be on the boundaries of being incel, maybe sex every few years.

Any femcels wanna chime in here? Would you bang young Bill Gates, ignoring the money aspect?

Yes he was super fuckable for like 2 seconds when he was young

Honestly, remove the glasses and he is probably either Brad or Chad-lite.

Slay, no. Do perfectly fine for himself, absolutely.

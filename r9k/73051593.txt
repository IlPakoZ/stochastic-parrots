While he is a beta retard that would compromise his actual beliefs for a woman, youre also delusional and couldnt begin to hope to justify your belief in the supernatural beyond appealing to faith

I think he meant more like he thinks her being his soulmate would evidence God somehow. 
Most intelligent believers know you can't prove God and several holy books say faith is a virtue for a reason. Some people need personal, emotional evidence though.

Thats all well and good, but thats not actual evidence for the supernatural. Its not differentiatable from imagination, unless you also believe dmt trips and NDE's are sufficient as well

Your laugh is forever ingrained in my brain

It's been 30 days and things just aren't the same without you
--- 73144913
I was in a really dark place when we met
You were like a ray of light to me, I almost believed I was dreaming or imagining everything
--- 73145155
>>73142515 (OP)

Eat my shit and fuck your mom with a screwdriver
--- 73145403
>>73145389
Oh but anon I think YOU dont know her 
Good luck with that. I hope you find out eventually so it goes by for you quicker. That is pretty pathetic.
--- 73145404
I wonder how many people she's added? I didn't think she added that much
--- 73145413
>>73145403

--- 73147430
>>73147314
Well I have and she had the sweetest voice you could have imagined, it matched her perfectly
I can still hear it in my head
I remember when she would hum a song quietly sometimes when she was busy or focusing on something
--- 73147449
>>73147430
Anon, can we talk on Discord? I want to talk about her, but not on this board.
--- 73147975
>>73147449
In a fit of rage and sorrow I deleted my discord, that's why im trying to find her here
How do I know you aren't trying to mess with me
Is that you Solace?
--- 73148009
>>73147975
No, I'm just someone else who fell in love with her. She stopped talking to me a while ago, so I'm just trying to find out what happened.
--- 73148165
>>73148009
She's mine back off
I don't feel like talking to you right now ask again tomorrow
Right now I need Solace to come comfort me
I miss hearing about her day or hearing about whatever she was thinking about
She was always so creative
It made me sad when she had sad thoughts though
--- 73148184
>>73148165
She's yours, huh? She probably liked you more than she did me, it seems. Man, that makes me sad.
--- 73148209
>>73142515 (OP)

--- 73148276
>>73142515 (OP)

No one who concerns you
>>73148276

Maybe you were busy today
Good night Solace
I wish I could hear you say it back
--- 73148459
>>73148305
Get meds. Immediately
--- 73148511
>>73148459
The only meds I need is the comfort and understanding that she used to give me
--- 73149337
>>73142515 (OP)

--- 73149602
>>73142515 (OP)
anon, she probably had like 10~ orbiters you being the 11th one. Move on and find another girl, 
Other than that, Saya no Uta is very pog
--- 73149672
*sigh* I had a really big crush on her too. I've come to realize that it's just that sort of classic situation where your crush likes someone else. I guess I'm just going to let time heal my wounds.

Exactly. And keep in mind that if you were living in the 1950s, you would have a queue of women for you.

dunno about the rest of them but I'm down I'm broke

Yeah this is the true blackpill. Women will not shack up with a guy they are repulsed by, even if he is a billionaire

160k is not that much in a big city, really depends on where you're from. But you can thank abolition of the patriarchy for that.

Just go to SEA at this point, use your money and the promise of a green card to punch above your weight.

>>73081939
you are delusional if you think a billionaire can't have almost any woman he pleases.
--- 73081984
>>73081963
Not OP but I am white and 6ft4, the only women who have hit on me are ugly Indian hags and a 3/10 sea monkey at my work. Its over.

People have such a distorted perception of wealth it's insane, median income in the US is about $30k, and median income in NYC is only five thousand higher. 50% of people make less than this amount.

You're supposed to be the one hitting on them, only low tier women will be the ones hitting on you. Even if you're Chad. Women expect a guy to be the one hitting on them.

>personality is important 
>you probably have a low status/lame job 

Money is just one of many things women care about, and you aren't even making that much of it. Yeah to a lower class girl 160k is a lot, btu that same type of girl is more likely to care about personality and dark triad shit that can get her off than living a comfy, jobless existence since she's already used to living in poverty.

OP is just salty that all the 10/10 bitches won't dive on his dick now that he's got a decent paying job.

Household income includes all adult members of a household, so it's usually two individual incomes combined.
Earning more than double that is a lot of fucking money.

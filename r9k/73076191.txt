If your problem is your body, an option is to fix it in the gym. If you mean what kind of girls can you get with this body, surprisingly a lot I would say, most women don't really care that much. I would say that a guy who is confident with his bad body has more chances with girls than a bodybuilder with low self esteem

I have the same build, but i'm skinny instead of fat, and have even wider hips. It sucks having people think you're actually an FTM.

He had a sense of humor and aimed for a 6/10 girl. He was also studying theology and most of the students were female so the odds were somewhat on his favor.

You could try shaving your pussy. That's an awful bush. This isn't the 1970s any more.

Getting laid as an euphemism for genuine love, I mean
sex would be great but having someone that can look at me and still say he likes me? Ecstatic

She was 300lbs and we were together for years. 

Then I lost my job, had to move, and she decided she didn't want to do LDS. 

How's your lingerie game? Hers was on point. Unfortunately she wasn't into skirts and was only 3" shorter than me.

Kill yourself. You're the jews of gender.

you look attractive though, my husband has the same body type, you just need to get a better skin care routine and maybe hit up the gym

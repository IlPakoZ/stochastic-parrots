It means Women prefer Black men the most. Black men are the least likely to be filtered out of their preference settings.

The older the age demographics gets the more likely they prefer White men. The younger the age demographic gets everyone else gets a boost in their SMV levels except Whites and Indians

May have something to do with American zoomers being majority nonwhite themselves

Majority of Americans are still White.
I don't understand how a lower population of Whites would dictate the preference settings?
Sounds like delusional cope.

The younger the demographic is the more likely they filter out Whites. The red line here in this chart represents White men.

Disinformation agents aim to undermine human rights and social cohesion. They have infiltrated the media and the internet to spread lies, half-truths, and manipulative messages designed to divide, dishearten, and demoralize. One particular area where disinformation agents have been active is in the realm of dating and relationships. These agents peddle dubious statistics and pessimistic narratives to make people believe that finding love is nearly impossible, and that the world of dating has become an unsalvageable wasteland.

In this article, we aim to counteract the damaging effects of disinformation on dating by presenting the truth. We will provide you facts based on reliable sources and studies, highlighting positive trends and debunking the most common false claims. By the end of this article, we hope to equip you with the knowledge necessary to fight back against disinformation and reclaim your confidence in the dating world.
--- 73062221
Myth 1: "You will only be successful in dating if you are extremely attractive."

Reality: While physical attractiveness is certainly one aspect that can influence romantic interest, studies have shown that people value other qualities, such as kindness, intelligence, and sense of humor, just as much when looking for a partner. A study conducted by A. Feingold (1988) found that people who are simply perceived as more attractive actually received no more dating or sexual partners than their less attractive counterparts.
--- 73062224
Myth 2: "The dating world is increasingly becoming a place where only casual hook-ups thrive."

Reality: Disinformation agents would have you believe that commitment is dead, but this is far from the truth. A study from the University of California, Santa Barbara found that while casual relationships may be more common in some contexts, people still yearn for long-term, committed relationships. In fact, a recent 2021 study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships demonstrated that despite the rise in casual dating, a majority of people are still interested in developing and maintaining serious romantic relationships.
--- 73062228
Myth 3: "Technology is ruining romance."

Reality: It's true that technology has changed the way we connect with potential romantic partners, but it has not suffocated love or connection. On the contrary, online dating platforms and social media have opened up new avenues for people to find love across greater distances, cultures, and social backgrounds. In 2021, a Pew Research Center survey reported that 39% of adults aged 18 to 29 and 27% of those 30-39 found a significant other or long-term partner through online dating.
--- 73062231
In a world plagued by disinformation, seeking the truth becomes an act of resistance. By educating ourselves and others about the reality of dating and relationships, we can disempower disinformation agents and foster a healthier, more optimistic mindset about love and connection. We must remember that there are countless success stories and happy couples that prove cynics wrong every day.


Dating may not always be easy or smooth, but it's essential not to lose hope and to recognize that love can still thrive in our world. Disinformation agents want us to feel divided, lonely, and bitter; we must remain vigilant against such narratives that seek to undermine our happiness and belief in human connection.

The truth is that love, connection, and commitment are still very much alive and well. By arming ourselves with the knowledge that happy, healthy relationships are not a thing of the past, we can effectively challenge the disinformation being spread and regain control over our dating lives.

By perpetuating stereotypes and stoking racial grievances, race baiting undermines the very fabric of our society. It erodes the bonds of trust and cooperation that are critical for social cohesion and hinders the creation of inclusive, diverse communities. This can lead to the deterioration of public discourse and the fraying of collaborative efforts to address pressing social, economic, and political issues.

Dear user,

I understand that the topic you bring forth might trigger intense emotions and provide fodder for debates; however, I'd like to gently remind you of the importance of maintaining a civil and constructive environment for discourse on this platform.

It is well-documented that race baiting tactics do not contribute to furthering productive discussions or promoting understanding among different groups of people. Instead, they often merely serve to reinforce pre-existing stereotypes, further entrench divisive views, and undermine the essential unity that we should be striving for as human beings.

Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that." In keeping with this mindset, I encourage you to focus on bringing light to challenging topics by encouraging honest, empathetic, and well-informed conversations. This approach is far more likely to lead to meaningful insights and bridge the divides that exist between us.

I believe that our collective responsibility is not to perpetuate disinformation or engage in race baiting, but to continuously seek the truth, be well-versed in history and facts, and engage in honest, respectful dialogue.

Thank you for considering my perspective, and I hope that we can work together to foster an environment conducive to growth and healing.

People have diverse preferences when it comes to dating; it is crucial to respect individual choices and not judge or discriminate against someone based on such preferences. The algorithms of dating apps do not prioritize one race over another; they are designed to facilitate connections based on a user's interests, preferences, and location. It is vital to recognize that our society is made up of diverse individuals with differing experiences and perspectives. We must resist the urge to fall prey to disinformation and instead focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and unity.

This isnt true at all. Most men prefer women with their own income and as the other anon pointed out, people overwhelmingly date those within their own social class.

>making up stuff
OP is retarded. The data clearly shows that blacks are the least popular race. 
The least popular men are Asians, while the least popular women are Black women. 
Hispanic men and White men are by far the most the most popular men on the app. The same goes for Hispanic women and White women. 
Blacks also receive fewer matches and replies on the app, especially Black women. That is one of the points of the article. 

Source: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/03/22/online-daters-are-less-open-minded-than-their-filters-suggest

If 100 women want to date a Hispanic man, but they exclude 50% because of age etc, that will filter out 50% of Hispanic men. 
If 10 women want to date a Black man, but they exclude 20% because of age etc, that will filter out 20% Black men. 
In the scenario above, Hispanic men are still far more popular than Black men even though a higher percentage of Hispanic men are filtered out.
--- 73062620
>>73062599

If you look at the original image anon.
The default base line(red) is Whites.

As the age demographic gets younger and younger they start filtering out Whites more and more.
Thus i labeled the most important age groups of 20-29. What you are stating rings true amongst the older demographics.

The data set point you showcased is a group of all age demographics. Its a gian mental gymnastic cope you are suffering from.

Im sure you'll point on the Match % rate also which ill counter with the overall population differences between races.

Filter the Data set by Age.
As the age demographic increases(30+ range). More and more people prefer White men.
As the age demographic decreases (20+ range). More and more people filter out White men.

I did read the study.

Your image once again is a Data set point that combines all Age demographics of 18-65+.
Older demographics are irrelevant too us younger fokls. You are just trying to make this fit ur narrative to cope about the realities.

the stats genuinely are meaningless, the entire point of OP's article is that filters don't accurately predict who's actually picked on these apps. they specifically focus on Black Women, who are significantly more likely to pass through filters, but are much less likely to be chosen once they get through.
--- 73063250
>>73062653
you obviously didn't read the article. passing through filters only means that the Black men on this app are more likely to have a higher income, be taller, etc. (or to lie about it) than their White counterparts.
the whole point of the article is that people aren't choosing them when offered. there are more Blacks that fit these qualifications, but when they're actually offered as candidates they're rejected.
--- 73063381
>>73063250
>Black people fit the qualification more than other races
>Argues they get rejected more because of it
>Going by basic logic and math
>Blacks still get choosen more because they fit the qualification higher

I have no idea what cope argument you are trying to make anon?
White men are literally bottom tier in the 20-24 age bracket
--- 73063440
>73063381
>Black people fit the qualification more than other races
>Argues they get rejected more because of it
I didn't argue that, the article was specifically about the discrepancy between the chances of Blacks passing through filters and their chances of actually being selected.

>Going by basic logic and math
>Blacks still get choosen more because they fit the qualification higher
it's possible that half of all black men are removed through filters, and 99% of the remainder are removed through user selection, in which case the odds of one getting a date are near zero.
it's possible that half are removed through filters, and only 1% are removed through selection, in which case their odds are relatively good.
you didn't show any math, or even any logic, you just assumed this was true. without data, you're just a retard on an incel forum making shit up.

The age demographics refer to the age of the person getting picked, not the age of the person doing the picking.
--- 73064048
>>73061205 (OP)

"differences are even more striking when it comes to race. Users deploy racial filters sparingly. For example, black women pass through 36% of other users filters, compared with 44% for women of other races. This gap is similar to the effect of one inch of height for men. However, just 24% of black women are liked as prospects, versus 37% for non-black women, an impact as great as 11 inches of male height."
--- 73064049
Whitebros not like this
Nobody made a compelling argument so far lol. I kinda believe it with the rise of mano sphere groups, mass shooting, Andrew tate and everything.
--- 73064053
>>73061205 (OP)

"Filtering choices follow demographic patterns. Women block 70% of potential matches, compared with 55% for men, mostly because they tend to exclude users who are shorter or younger. Whereas women 5.5 (165cm) or shorter eliminate just 17% of people based on height, those 5.10 or taller remove 45%. And women in their 50s filter out 86% of users based on age, compared with 48% for those aged 25-34"
--- 73064089
>>73064053
And whats your point? This applies to all races.
At the end of the day Black men are being choosen more.
White men are falling off the cliff in terms of desirability as younger the age demographic becomes.


Next coper step on up.
--- 73064144
>>73064049
Same, the popularity of Latin Music, Hip hop, Kpop kinda made it more of a competitive space in the dating market. Correlates perfectly too with the rise of inceldom and what-not.

Women did prefer White men over any other demographic by a wide margin, but younger the demographic have becomes less likely to procreate with White men. I mean you can obviously see the difference if you walk around town. Especially for men who are in their late 20s and early 30s. Its completely different from back when i was growing up. The demographic shift is happening, but too what extent i have no idea.

I can sense the violent attacks and extremism to increase from White men in the upcoming years as their population starts declining even further and they become backed into a corner.

It will be a glorious time indeed. I wish i was born later in life to experience it at a younger age.

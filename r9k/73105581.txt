I made a tinder and only got 1 match after 2 days. It was an obese woman. Btw I'm an average looking guy face wise. And I have an above average looking body. How long until I know I'm fucked. 1 week? 1 month?. When I payed for boost in the past (a couple years ago) I'd get like 3-5 matches but it's fucking humiliating having to pay $29.99 for a tinder membership. I stopped using dating apps a year ago and now in thinking of waiting until I'm 30 to start dating. (I'm 23 rn) it feels like dating apps make it impossible to meet an average woman. Like I don't even want a 10/10 Stacy. Just a normal 5/10 or 6/10 woman who isn't fat and has a below average face. It's insane that im most likely going to have to wait until I'm 30 to get some used up woman. Should I turn gay? Idk it's so fucking over and it's been over since the Industrial Revolution started.

Dating apps are not made for men to find love, they're made to make you stay as long as possible, you'll probably end up paying to have more matches and you'll probably end up with 1 or 2 matches that are really worth it in like a year maybe

That doesn't exist. Because of fat women, all thin women are now Stacy. Sorry, but that's just the reality.

Always remember that fat women are the real enemy.

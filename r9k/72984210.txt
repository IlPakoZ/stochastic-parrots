Did we lose?
There was all this talk about a 'slippery slope' decades ago, and it seems like we lost. 
There was all this talk about corporations getting too powerful a century ago, and it seems like we lost.
There was all this talk about the royalty and their indulgence plaguing the world some few centuries ago, and it seems like we lost.
Etc
I don't like the idea of shrugging as I look at the world and saying 'well, that's that then', but we did lose right? The average human, specifically the average human with enough free time to recognize the rung of the ladder they reside on, lost right?
And, if we lost, what do we do from there? Are we just supposed to exist at the losers for the rest of our worthless lives?
Seems a little gay to me.

Society is plagued by mindless consumers cultivated by drugs and politics to fulfill point one.
Society is plagued by heartless corporations that do all that they can do to benefit the few at the cost of the many as well as at the cost of culture. That fulfills point two.
And society is plagued by a ruling class that continues to treat the masses like nothing more than puppets to send to war or to send to work. That handles point three.
We've lost as far as humanity could possibly be concerned. The question is what's next.

Yeah, we lost. Huxley predicted it, the average person couldn't care less unfortunately. We could try fighting back in some form, but after seeing how comfortable the average person is with the status quo, and how quickly they'd throw you under the bus for good boy points, do you really think it's worth fighting back? Freedom isn't free after all.

>what's next.
Either extermination, or an increasing gap between subhumans (lower classes that live off physical and spiritual goyslop) and royalty (ruling class, the ones with their humanity left untouched). Probably a mix of both. Someone made a thread here the other day, speculating on the purpose of the recent AI quick development and deployment. That bread and circus is used to keep the masses pacified is nothing new, but the advent of such powrful technology is a game changer. Also, everyone wants to get over with it already and I hate to bring it up again but covid isn't gone. The long term effects are subtle and sure as hell affect mood, intelligence and propaganda susceptibility. Not to mention, the ongoing fracturing of traditional social roles, etc, which ultimately bring on isolation, and so on and on.

We lost. Hard.

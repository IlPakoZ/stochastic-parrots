Even though this will be ignored or overshadowed by a tranny or race bait (BBC) thread. I just want to say I don't know anymore about life. It isn't about getting a gf or wife anymore, hell it never was. I tried to feel better... I tried working out, 5 months as of now... Found no hobbies that interested me enough to deal with other people. Tried the meme called therapy.... Hell even tried shitty medication that was prescribed to me. This isn't a fake suicide post or anything. I don't want to die... I just want to be happy. I am not looking for advice anymore. Especially from this board just wanted to say something about since I have no one else to say it too. All alone, numb, tired and just want to quit but can't. I don't expect even 1% of this normie filled board to understand this but to the one 1% who do... There is no escape just temporary relapses of judgement when you feel happy just for a bit. It doesn't get better. Nothing works. Take care and if you read this far and see the picture for the .01% who read it in the past you'll know who I am. Also one more thing, good luck.

I agree. I am 35, mildly disabled with weak muscles and balance, unemployment and living in a small town with few jobs that I can do. I feel like I have tried a lot of things and have not gotten far I am grateful for what I have but I feel lonely and depressed because even if I got one of the two jobs that I recently applied for they do not pay well

I am also 5 ft 8 and ugly.

I remember you, I talked to you last time. I'm not sure what to respond with anon, but I read your post. Good luck to you too.

I didn't talk with him last time
I wish I could reach people here sometimes and actually make things positive instead of just generating words on a screen they read.

I get it man. By all outside measures my life is going pretty good, got a great job and my life is on track to be pretty comfortable. In my head however I feel like shit, all I wanted was to have a loving wife and live a long and happy life with her, unfortunately though such a thing is not possible in this world. Every day I go to bed I hope that I die in my sleep, mainly to avoid the responsibility of suicide, or preferably that I end up in a coma for the rest of my life, I find that dreams are far more enjoyable than real life even if they aren't my ideal they're still more fun. The only reason I keep going is for this seemingly intangible idea of revenge, my entire existence is boiled down to hatred, even though that's not what I wanted my life to become. Truly, it is all so tiresome.

I did have a conversation with OP last thread, I just really don't know what to say. At the very least I want him to know I read his post and it touched me deeply and I can relate and there's nothing I can say to help.

Can't you get NEETbux for your disability though? Wageslaving has made me extra suicidal

Too relatable.
Life has no intrinsic purpose, I fear.
All self-made purpose is just nihilistic masturbation.

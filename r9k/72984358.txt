I mean if you have an actual goal or reason that would be achieved by said self improvement no. If you dont yes. For example
>i want to work out to get ladies
>Will you leave your house and interact with ladies when you have a better body?
>no
Thats cope, you are playing at making a change while not actually confronting the issue you have.
>i want to work out so I am stronger and my body feels better
>working out directly accomplishes this
In this scenario its not cope it was a method to achieve the sought after goal.

Every character would be black or brown or female and it would center around having sex and there wiuld be cameos from celebrities and/or product placements and the jokes would be unfunny cringe but with laugh tracks that act like they said the funniest shit.

All three of the guys would be incel. George would be dateless throughout the show. Jerry would get a few dates but would end up getting ghosted. Kramer would be in his room jacking it to hentai, only popping into Jerry's apartment to get some hand moisturizer.

Elaine's character would be the same for the most part but the men visiting her apartment would be more attractive.

Kramer is the Chad of the gang. You crazy?

What passed as a chad in the 90s doesn't cut mustard today, my friend. There's no way a man with an aerodynamic profile like Kramer would get anywhere near Zoomette poon.

Thats what actual Seinfeld was, except it was actually reasonable that George and Krammer would have gfs too.

Jerry would have a residence in Las Vegas
Elaine would sleep with Puddy (again)
George would be seeing escorts and living in his dead parents' house until the inheritance runs out
Kramer would be a Great Grandpa

It wouldn't exist because the lifestyle and friendships depicted in the show are no longer achievable in real life.

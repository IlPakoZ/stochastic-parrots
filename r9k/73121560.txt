STOP COMPLIMENTING MY HEIGHT

Kids have laughed and called me ugly in public.

i use a facemask, and a hat and tend to look down. i should REALLY get sunglasses

i absolutely adore facemask culture for normalizing facemasks so i never feel awkward wearing one, and i get to be anonymous in public

it makes going outside bearable

it sucks cause i would dress so nicely and look so good if my face and hair could look as good as the clothes
>>73121605
its very easy to tell that that's not true, by just stepping outside in public for 3 mins

face masks do make me look a lot cuter, but it doesn't help the pain that is my hair. 
>>73121704

self perception v. others perception
you have a distorted self image.
--- 73121818
>>73121788

its very easy to be objective about this. if i ever posted that photo of me anywhere, id be ridiculed forever

--- 73121996
>>73121989
No, it's possible to be ugly, obviously.
But OP is not ugly because I said so, ok?!

camera lenses can also distort. pictures are not irl. some people are just not photogenic for a variety of reasons. take it from me, because I became extremely upset with my looks from being forced to look at my face and awkward presence in terrible photos for years. at one point I just started saying NO to pictures.
I have good and bad days even just looking in the mirror, but I am growing into myself more each day despite never liking what I perceived myself to be for as long as I can remember.
I remember it being a meh day and I took a selfie with a new phone in some decent natural light. This was just for curiosity's sake and not to post on social media or anything as I would never do that, but I kind of liked what I saw. Even though you could apply the same idea of distortion to this, I do think it was more accurate to what I would perceive in the mirror on a good day, so that helped boost my confidence a bit.

Well I'm glad, maybe you should try perceiving yourself as the version you want to be rather than the version that is dragging you down

>Good job drunk anon!
congratulating me makes it sound like i was otherwise an alcoholic- which, i was a little bit before because i didnt feel like stopping drinking before me intial week break
>Pic rel is only alcohol i really like, but still rarely drink
have you tried harder alcohol? why dont you drink proper liquor? things like those drinks will give you really bad hangovers, you should try whisky. 
the legal standard for drinking is 1 drink per hour. and one shot is one drink, and so is like 1 beer. theyre all considered 1 drink. if you drink 2-3 drinks an hour over the span of 6 hours youll probably enjoy yourself. alcohol makes you dehydrated, so its best to have an entire glass of water per 1-2 drinks. also stop drinking about 2 hours before bed. or about 1h 45 minutes at best. if you do all of this, youll almost certainly avoid getting hungover and will be able to drink multiple nights in a row
>I think i'll always submit in the end.
yeah :/
>True!
but you should be okay with action
>makes me feel physically sick
youve had this your whole life though right? isnt it true that after you get over the hump you feel better? i think youre in a position where youre paralyzed from not wanting to do anything because you dont realize that everything falls back into equilibrium, so youre demotivated to do anything because you assume if you do youll be stuck and never feel right/ comfy again- but its maybe worth noting that once you climb the mountain your life does feel normal again after

>Though the act of being forced to do things and having things done to you is inherently hot to me
Thoughts?
thats a really dense subject desu that could go so many ways. i think its legitimate in the context of somebody you have a lot of legitimate trust in. theirs nothing really wrong with that at that point in time. but i think a lot of bottoms tend to have an extraordinarily low bar when it comes to this, a minor amount of day-to-day trust goes a long way in sexual trust/ if that person is attractive for a bottom
>w-woah buddy. Why not earlier threads? 
cause i wasnt in them. im not in every thread, sometimes i go leaps in time not being here. this recent stint just starts at the 70s 
>i'm kinda like that to a much lesser degree. I don't like deleting stuff and so on
you cant make decsions but i can; and i cant delete shit, but you can. this is why the intp/infp types compliment each other well

nono, its a useful skill and its better than goyslopping your way through life especially because its technically cheaper
>It was working good and then it stopped
why not further simulate that environment though? you know that being in those situations makes you do shit, so why not just put yourself into those environments?

being out on the wild an everything that comes with it can be exciting, i think you need to work on finding comfort outside of traditional means. their isnt a fluffy comfy bed but you are growing as a person and you are gaining new skills etc you should find comfort in the simpleness of it. that you dont need an entire sprawling city to be comfy. theirs comfort in that

>I do like being away from people. Explain the appeal to me?
less is more? cities are inherently complicated and the work that it takes to conquer it is useless, it necessities human action. it also houses horrible people. rural areas and the woods are comfy in how disconnected they are from the modern world of stress and emotion and all of the exhaustion of everyday life. its just two different lifestyles, city lifestyle exhausts you mentally and emotionally, woods lifestyle exhausts you physically but you remain intact as a person. its interesting in that way that woods people are seen as lacking emotion while city niggers are seen as emotional- even though in practice its woods people who are easily emotionally exhausted and city people who tend toward sociopathic behaviors

I used to be cute but aged very quickly (probably due to meds), by the time I move out of my parents' house and am able to finally start dating, I'll probably be too ugly. But I'll try it anyways I guess.

Try dating now, just don't let them go to your house

Anon, I'm going to say this as tactfully as possible. Unless you have rotten teeth (or have holes in them) missing limbs, are disfigured somehow, you will likely be fine.

Hi, I'm chubby, don't like anal, but am very dominant (not cruel unless you want me to be). I also cook, clean, and am good at doing laundry and stuff (even complicated things). No, I still can't fold a fitted sheet though. 

Caveat: if you're someone who doesn't like strong smelling room sprays or is allergic to cats you may not like me.

SEXHAVERS IN THIS FREAKING THREAD
--- 72970409
I should stop voluntarily giving out so many warning signs, it does me no good obviously. Well if i could predict how things would end up i'd do it differently. More i think about things like this more i regret how i handled certain interractions. In fact, looking back, i could've had a pretty awesome deal if i wasn't too scared and honest/considerate. He would be ok with it too ;_;
--- 72970417
>>72970353
Damn I thought sides were super rare, I'm surprised you were able to find guys
--- 72970438
>>72970353

I have a bit of a belly but nothing too drastic. 
>hold me down, make me smell them
Well, do you like that?
--- 72970447
>>72970417
they weren't necessary sides, mostly top guys who'd settle for fooling around and getting sucked off a bit. most would fuck me if they could.

>>72970438
>Well, do you like that?
its like a need for me. i just like thicker guys who make me feel owned.
--- 72970469
>>72970409
I just hand red flags out like freaking candy. They can deal with or not because it's the worst im going to get. Idk anon what if you get into a long relationship and they only later realise how much of a sperg you are
--- 72970470
Sides are cool
--- 72970473

What Red flags you give?
--- 72970477
>>72970447
>they weren't necessary sides, mostly top guys who'd settle for fooling around and getting sucked off a bit. most would fuck me if they could
Aaah so it's fine for hookups but probably harder to find long term
>>72970470
I agree
--- 72970487
>>72970477
>harder to find long term
yeah, especially since sides basically have their own top / bottom dynamics in addition to guys who just see it as an equalist thing.

most sides are just bottoms who stopped bottoming so want to suck dick. i hate having my dick sucked. I like a dick in my face but not really into bobbing my head for a guy.
--- 72970557
>>72970487
>i hate having my dick sucked.
why? i would try to suck the bottoms dick a lot

oh my god lol
--- 72970645
>>72970469
You shouldn't probably. I do it too :(
>Idk anon what if you get into a long relationship and they only later realise how much of a sperg you are
This is why i do it. If anyone wants to be with me or even friends they should know , that's the logic. If they like me for who i am (very rare) that i know they like me despite knowing how i am
But jokes on you  as i was in a long relationship where he knew how much of a sperg i am and it didn't work out 
>>72970473
It's hard to put into words
>get too close to someone quickly, give up too many intimate details
>probably desperation
>"here is a list of all the things wrong with me, is this how you attract someone :D"
I also don't give up too much positive feedback cause i'm so insecure and scares od being rejected (or of misinterpreting a signal) that anything than literally saying " hey i have strong feelings for you, wanna be bfs?" wouldn't be enough to convince me the other person is interested in me. It probably makes people lose interest and think i'm not interested in them
--- 72970662
Just want to hide away
Didn't even go outside today
I want to die today
When I woke up I cried today

Stargazing wide awake
If I had wings I'd fly away
Wish I could pause the game
Delete the save and just start again

I often lie awake
Thinking of my great escape
No time for heartbreak
From those feelings I shy away

Treated just like a toy
Always playing with my heart
I'm so emotional
Emotionally scarred

Feel like a background character
Playing my part
I need some surgery
Surgery on my heart

My only friend is my computer
I feel like such a loser
I'm so ugly I'm so stupid
Never learned I need a tutor

Yeah that's what i did :/
>Seems like a lose lose situation either way
That's only because it is. But i think being more reserved is worth a shot. You probably shouldn't unload all your issues on someone you don't know well enough. t-then again ehat if they stop talking to you after you do so arghhhhhhhhh

storyanon barely relevant accident time. 

In hs we had an exchange student from Bavaria (and one from a town near Hamburg, too), he was cute even though I barely said more than two words to him.

The other one from Hamburg was a weirdo, claimed to be a right-winger and that his father was some NPD party member. Wore his grandfather's Gestapo jacket to school until he got in trouble for it and had to stop. Said his other grandfather was in the SS and was killed during the war. 

I think like me he could have been making stuff up though, as he changed his story a couple times. First saying his Grandfather was killed at Stalingrad, then later on to Kursk.

I'm the other guy you replied but it depends. The only people ive seen get in a fist fight were Hispanic and Black. Asians and Whites seem to keep out of those kinds of things. 

Which me personally? I agree with. Ive see way too many videos of street fights where the guy gets picked up and fucking slammed to the ground and starts spazing the fuck out. I'm not getting fucking paralyzed over anything especially not over being called a slur.
--- 72972931
>>72972881

He was also just generally an asshole to people. The thing is, he was no tall, blonde haired, blue eyed ubermensch. Dude was rather short, not all that strong/buff, and was brown eyes/ black hair. Without his jacket no one would even know he wasn't just a run of the mill amerimutt.

Oh no, they never fought back. Plus they were kinda used to it since this was the midwest in the mid 2000s, not get killed for being gay level but you were definitely going to catch a few slurs thrown your way.

>The thing is, he was no tall, blonde haired, blue eyed ubermensch.
people who pretend to know shit about germany but have the most superficial overview of third reich era germany
think for two seconds about what this actual literal character actually is "blue eyed blond haired tall" thats a genetic outlier everywhere you fucking imbecile
this retarded terminally western terminally American scholarship that larps as though ALL of germany had these triats! yup! germany! blue eyed blond haired! a nation of genetic exceptions! 

you have to believe 1 of 2 impossible things

1. you have to believe that germany became a nation full of genetic exceptions sometime between 1933-1945 

or

2. that everyone in germany was delusional enough to believe that something very few people were was the real german and that the german people hated probably over half its population 

to make the claim that everyone in germany believed in this really movie plot tier character as the supreme being you have to somehow justify the fact that this type of person was never common to german society. how would german society therefore worship as the most legitimate being, be a person that was not common? how would that actually happen? does something like that make rational sense?

the ubermensch was an ideal that consisted primarily of character traits which are more prevalent in certain phenotypical expressions. so blond, blue eyed, and tall were three individual traits that most often yielded men of greater character
mocking people for their appearance is obscene.

--- 72973139
>>72973131
>he was 
fuck.
he wasn't*
--- 72973186
>>72973131
he was having a plebbit moment where he made fun of the nazi larp german for not having blond hair, blue eyes, or for being tall. 
he was mocking him based on a lie produced by anti-german english and American historians who never bothered to understand anything about german society under hitler. 
the meltdown is warranted because its pretty fucking ridiculous to allow people to use retarded scholarship to justify mocking somebodies appearance and to put them down

even more so since its done from a glass house
--- 72973210
>all nazi era propaganda depict the nordic phenotype as the master race and superior

a-akushlally it was all Germans, and ubermensch was about character.

Meanwhile the nazis literally used phenotypical classifications to determine who was gassed or considered subhuman. 

never thought we'd get nazi apologists here.

Hello, mister bitterness? Go get mad at the breeders. Anytime I see a gay couple I get happy for them and I know that if they can do it, so can I

They're way more good looking than me though.

that's incredibly sweet bunny tysmm! i'd love to hug you back, you really do deserve it, i mean it! well... actually yes! it was my father's birthday today, so we just went out to have some dinner! (thats also the reason for my late reply, bleh, im sorry for that... i'll have all the time in the world to send messages now though ^^) i had a really good pizza which was nice! a pizza margeritha to be exact. do you like pizzas too? 
would you like to talk about anything fren? is there something you'd like to get off your chest? i can imagine that maybe you feel quite horrible and im totally ready to hear it all if you wish. if not that's okay too, then i can probably ramble about lego things ^-^ look forward to your reply bunny, stay strong lil one !

>theres a selection bias
Precisely. Theyre 4channers in the first place so they should ALL be ugly. But no, legit chads and cuties posting there

I'm occasionally tempted to post in one of those rate me threads but a) having my face on 4chan sounds like a bad idea and b) someone I know posts very embarrassing posts on /soc/ and I don't want to embarrass him by letting him know I know
--- 72978832
I'd like to see how others would rate me but i'm scared to post face. Not to mention sometimes they don't even rate others they just post their own. And i've seen posts be ignored if they post it late in the thread

Nigga 4chan is mostly cute ppl,you should know that by now :P

How can you be gay but uninterested in sex or relationships? You're not gay at all then. You're just nothing. There are people who are just not into sex or just not into relationships who can be gay but if you're both, how do you even consider yourself gay?

Sex is something you do, sexual attraction is something you feel.

AAAAAHHHH I HATE ANXIETY I HATE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE REAL AND HAVE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT THOUGHTS ABOUT ME

Is there a romantic equivalent of a friends with benefits? Like a guy I can talk to, visit and cuddle/kiss every week or two.

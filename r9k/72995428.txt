Is it really such a surprise that people who have been deprived of any sort of regular consensual sex during their developing years have turned to porn and gone down the fetish rabbit hole to a point where the idea of normal penis-in-vagina sex is no longer even arousing to them?

Mass-produced hardcore pornography was made freely available and accessible to children. These are the consequences. It was no accident.

-humans are horny animals
-people are bored and have a lot of free time on their hands
-there's this weird link between the sexual response system and the sympathetic nervous system that gives rise to fetishism where stimuli that are normally associated with stress or anxiety instead somehow produce arousal (which is why you get ridiculous outcomes like women fantasizing about being raped or people wanting to fuck dogs or get peed on)

I am a a furry porn artist, but I am having trouble with this one commission because I have never seen a vagina. It's a commission of a female character, but since all of the art I've drawn has been gay anal BDSM sex, I have no idea where to even start. I doubt this customer is an actual woman, as I don't really think that's important to ask, but I do need some assistance since I don't want to draw something that looks like I've never seen a vagina before. Can anyone link me a guide or some decent reference?

Reminder to everyone else that posters like these who say they hate porn are actually saying that they hate jews.

Combination of: mental illness, sex drive, isolated lifestyle, internet access, and a working imagination.
Porn can't do much more than pull back the layers covering someone's already latent sexual proclivities. But porn is not unique in this regard. You can discover a weird fetish pretty much from any innocuous depiction of it. You always hear of people having their fetishes "awakened" by some random film or TV show.

If you noticed that's why a lot of the Japanese porn appeared degenerate to Westerners back in the 00s early 10s. Japan's youth had the sexless trend before the West.

The porn today is degenerate but it's a reflection of the society rather than the other way around.

When the French Monarchy fell, their nobles were writing degenerate porn like this.

I got my fetish from a very young age, but I have no clue where from. I think the idea of seeing said fetish in porno was what led me to my coomer phase. I cannot watch regular porn - it needs to have my kink in it.

>The insertion of a foreign body into the urethra is a delicate matter that may prevent patients from presenting promptly. It can have serious long-term implications. Sexual experimentation and gratification, as well as underlying mental disorders, are considered the main causes of retained foreign bodies in the urethra and bladder. Management varies depending on the shape and size of the object, and the mechanism of insertion. Here we describe the case of a 15-year-old boy who self-inserted a USB wire into his proximal urethra. Manual and endoscopic attempts at removal were unsuccessful. A peno-scrotal urethrostomy was performed.

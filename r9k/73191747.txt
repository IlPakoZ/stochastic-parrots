And your response?

I'd be into trannies but I don't want to be fucking with a non-estrogenized male.
And also even with trannies you should take them to the vet to get neutered ASAP.

I'd hit him and take him out hunting since he clearly needs a father figure in his life.

Yeah man, he keeps saying "daddy" a lot and I don't know why.
--- 73191825
>>73191773
That's wild
--- 73191845
>>73191747 (OP)
Unlock him of course.
I really don't see the appeal of cages, let the guy have some fun.

really cute lingerie
--- 73191948
I wonder what milking a prostate feels like. Butt stuff is always a hassle, much easier to just have a wank. Besides to do it properly, they say you have to abstain for a bit, I can't do that; I'm too much of a coomer.

Ps. Really cute pic, if I didn't look like shit. I'd probably crossdress and do fetish stuff as well. Looks pretty fucking fun.

>>73191948
Cross dressing's fun, but if you still like women it's going to be pretty difficult to explain to 95% of them why your thighs and chest are hairless.
--- 73192080
>>73191948
It changes as the guy gets closer to cumming. It's sort of a smooth patch but eventually swells to like a fleshy ravioli as they go closer. 
>inb4 gay
I'm a cis foid lmao
--- 73192083
>>73191845
Agreed. Everyone knows the best part of being gay is giving the bottom a reacharound and pretending it went all the way through.
--- 73192088
>>73192049
>Cross dressing's fun
I can believe that. All the stereotypical girly shit seems fun. I'd gladly have a go at playing dress up with make up and all that.
>but if you still like women it's going to be pretty difficult to explain to 95% of them why your thighs and chest are hairless.
Because I honestly find it more comfortable. Unironically I'd find that part the most simple and straight forwardly easy to explain. Also masturbation is much more smooth the less hair you have.
--- 73192102
>>73192080
Souns fun, but a bit weird. Regardless, you have now answered one half of the question, thanks.

Ruined orgasms purely by stimulating dick are already fun, so I can only assume prostate stimulation makes it even better and allows to milk more out.

Bend her over and fuck her bussy, good girls only get to cum one way
--- 73192331
>>73192088

I get that, but people will assume it's because you're gay and cross dressing, which will be a deal breaker for 95% of women. Not all of course, but it's a tiny portion that won't care. Basically unless you're out, you won't be bringing home girls while hairless.
--- 73192358
>>73192331
WTF? This board told me girls hated hairy dudes? Should Is have my pubes or not?

>Be cis foids
>never shave unless going swimming (almost never do)

It's a double standard but I wont apologize for it.
--- 73192417
>>73191747 (OP)
No, sissies belong in chastity at all times.
Your little clitty is just for decoration.
--- 73192420
>>73192331
Well, I'm already quite the recluse and not bringing girls home anyways so I'm not missing out. As for people's assumptions? I couldn't give a shit.
>>73192381
Body hair on chicks depends. Let's say a girl went for the full mommy aesthetic with some thickness, massive jugs and some armpit hair and a slight bush. You know what? I think that's sexy, it has a mature vibe to it.
--- 73192434
>>73192420
I have a 36 H/G (sorta between rn) and a dozen hair around each nipple, take it or leave it.
--- 73192438
>>73192358
Pubes, sure. I'm talking about hairless thighs, chest, stomach. That raises questions.
>>73192381
Sounds hot. But it's a numbers game for guys. Have to decide if they're willing to forsake 95% of women to have fun and maybe meet the occasional girl like you.
--- 73192453
>>73192434
You know, why not? I'd give it a go.
--- 73192457
>>73192381
>tfw when I also have strong Germany genes that make me really hairy and girls want hairless twinks now
It's all ogre...
--- 73192460
>>73192420
Then go for it. Get a wax kit, creams get expensive quick and hair grows back out fast and shaving's itchy and way more work, plus you only get a day or two out of it.
--- 73192465
>will never be anon's personal fleshlight wearing cute lingerie and always locked up while he watches his favorite porno
no homo btw
--- 73192478
>>73192465

That's no fun, I would be making you play lewd games as a female character whilst locked up and teasing you.
--- 73192488
>>73192460
Yeah. I actually need to look into waxing anyways. How long does a proper wax last if you do it at home?
>>73192465
I wanna watch smut together and put my fingers in you while you stroke my dick. Way more fun, ACTIVE fun.
--- 73192548
>>73192465
aww you poor girl, If it were up to me I'd sculpt you into an adorable little sissy. Helplessly horny and obedient
no homo ofc
--- 73192568
>>73192488
Depends on your pace and pain tolerance. I only did once, took hours a day for a few days. The pain's no joke and I was worried about injury, but the results were great. Supposedly it gets easier the second and third time because your roots are smaller on the newer hairs.
--- 73192590
>>73192568
Fair enough. I'm not known for extremely massive pain tolerance, but I think I could deal with this. I'm not massively hairy luckily. I mean I grow hair everywhere but the hair itself isn't really thick or particularly strong.

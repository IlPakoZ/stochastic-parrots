How do I get over my height insecurity? Until recently I didn't really think about it, but recently two new coworkers (6'4" and 6'6") have joined my workplace. It's impossible for me to feel comfortable standing next to them, they make me feel like a dwarf... I'm 5'7"

I die a little bit inside whenever anyone over 5'4" complains about being short. If you're taller than most women you have no reason to complain about anything.

Most women of the current generation are the same height as me. The only ones who aren't are immigrants from East Asia or Central America
I don't want to be taller or anything but still feel a little insecure around very tall people

I'm 6'4, I wish I was like 5'4 or 5'2. I HATE being tall.

Why would you want to be that short??

5'7" is fine don't let lankets and woman who say you have to be 6' or taller get to you.

Our time will come short kings.

Ideally the difference in height between men and woman should only be like 3 inches at most. There's nothing wrong with that. You're not going to have good sex if the height difference is too great.

This post reeks of closeted homosexuality.

I'm totally fine around women. My insecurity is mostly about my own self-doubts and apprehension. I don't understand why being tall is so prized that you're made to feel lesser for being short or average

I'll be honest--I do have a slight humiliation kink, including being emasculated. But it also makes me feel sad and depressed so I don't think I should encourage it

5'3 anon here. don't worry, your height is something you can't change but there's nothing wrong with being short.
some people here as in real life will want to make you feel bad about it, but that's because they are bad people on the inside. that's an advantage if you think about it, because they expose themselves as not worth it, so stay away and ignore those kind of people.
>I do have a slight humiliation kink, including being emasculated
me too, but also with love.

I just realized that being here doesnt help me. It is just addicting to have my weaknesses and insecurities validated by rando anons on the internet. That being said, I wish I wasnt so lonely and I wish I didnt care so much about my past and the sad thoughts I have all the time. I could be outside working and meeting people and experiencing things but I would rather be chronically online and consume vasts amount of pointless media. It is quite sad. I need a change but I cant seem to. I guess darwinism will take its course on me. I hope I can change in time

This place is a crab bucket, you'll be validated for your shortcomings and ridiculed for your achievements. It's all meant to keep you down, make you feel good but not TOO good.

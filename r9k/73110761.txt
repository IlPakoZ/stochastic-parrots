is it an adhd thing or does everybody totally zone out and then realize you missed like an hour of the show you were watching/listening to while also scrolling on your phone

People without adhd don't get what executive dysfunction is like. It isn't being easily distracted or not being able to do things you don't want to, and it extends to being unable to do things related to basic quality of life (e.g. work, chores, showering, etc) or even things you actually want to do

How about focusing on one screen at a time you dopamine junkie.

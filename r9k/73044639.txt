I believe this is mostly an American phenomenon.
>What went wrong?
Majority of the population intakes too many calories and doesn't exercise enough. Lack of exercise is exceedingly common in the modern world, so the real problem is the calorie excess. Put simply, bitches need to put the fork down.

literally the food supply. it's loaded with unhealthy grains like corn, oats, and wheat, not to mention extra sugar &amp; HFCS. it's quite similar to fattening a calf for slaughter. feed it loads of corn that it's not meant to eat, and watch the marbling happen.

In high-school (Romania 2010's AD) the girls would sit on the bench routinely for p e and just be present and move their ass when the couch would give marks .

They're hot and not exactly fat. Don't give a fuck.

female empowerment and fat acceptance. combine those two with the fact that men are simps and you get a generation of women who are aggressive and lazy.

I realized there's no point in being healthy or fit. What do I gain? How does it benefit me? Why should I want them? What changes? So far I have only experienced positive changes - I'm less tired all the time, and less anxious. I stopped trying because it does not benefit me to be healthy or thin.
I'm not overweight technically but I can't get up a flight of stairs without wheezing

You missed the tail end of gen x girls and their low rise pants
--- 73045380
>>73045341
Low rise pants were a cruel joke, millennial women all had gross beer guts hanging out of them. Now zoomer girls being quite fit and skinny is also a cruel joke because now they all wear those potato sack pants that go up to their waists.

when people have no hope for the future, they collect hedonistic vices
the mentality is: I will suffer and die anyway, so why should I not just destroy my body in a way that brings me pleasure?

If your mind is making you miserable for no good reason then its a good way to shut it up introducing a physical threat to it by causing minor harm to the body. Haven't you watched Life of Pi? Fear keeps you alive. It also releases endorphins but I dont think its anything significant.

Social contagion. It became a meme that heckin depressed teenagers cut themselves, so now it's some sort of rite of passage used to validate the idea of having depression. As in, cutting themselves "proves" that their depression is real and reflective of how hard their lives are.

teenies are most suceptible to this

the solution is to look for other valves to get rid of the negative feelings you get as a teen girl.

A very healthy vavlve is exercise, it hurts and you feel great afterwards. Exercise has massive positive effects, basically if you could sell a drug with the effects of exercise it would be the most expensive drug on the planet bar none.

I asked a female co-worker if I could text her after I quit my job last week. She said yes. 

I texted her the next day, no response. 

I go in today to pick up my last pay check and she doesn't acknowledge me at all. Just nothing. As if I was a stranger or didn't exist... 

Why would someone do this? Did I come off too strong through text? All I did was say hi and brought up a dumb inside joke we used to have.

Why do people have to be so mean? I was interested in her but I would've also been content with just being friends. What is this reason for this awkwardness? We got along great as co-workers. 

Why would someone do this? Why would you be so mean? I just wanted friends. :(

Why ask? Just text.
Anyway, don't beat yourself up, you didn't do anything wrong. At least you tried and gained some experience. Next time maybe you will have more luck. Also, just because she didn't respond yet doesn't mean she won't respond.

Because you don't have value. You need to build value by yourself.

OP read about "briffault's law".

The reason for what you observe is there is no longer any value to being associated with you, therefore you dont exist anymore. You'll see this happen over and over again

It doesn't only apply to males though, it applies to everyone.

Yeah, I assume that's correct, although not as usually apparent since women are usually more entrenched socially and therefore have something akin to "innate" value.

Just did CPR for several minutes on my roommate. A cop who said he's seen many fentanyl overdoses insisted it was fentanyl. He's at the hospital, getting transferred to a more serious establishment soon. Don't know whether he's going to make it.

like I said, you'd be surprised. Another guy comes in and they scan his lungs and there's a dark spot and he freaks out because he thinks it's cancer and they're like we just need to do a biopsy. So they open him up and it was a small piece of spaghetti he had inhaled years ago with like puss growing on it, it was totally harmless, they scooped it out and he was fine. So then he is in the hospital recovering and he keeps freaking out, he thinks that it really was cancer and they're just lying to him to make him feel better. Dude was on like the 13th floor and jumps out the window and kills himself, because he was worried about cancer he didn't have. It's all perspective anon.

I don't know why I do psychedelics desu. like 2-3 times a year I'll take them, and it's an absolute horror show every time. what an ordeal. So much more happened mentally at one point I was literally yelling and holding my ears in terror and panic. 

also when I was hunting for them I saw this girl in a forest doing it as well. fuck it was weird/scary. not on the path either and she's like walking stopped down looking. She's about 10 meters away from me I hear footsteps and get scared then I see her, and she just looks at me I look at her she must have been about 20. we just look at each other for like 10 seconds. it was so creepy and weird just all alone in this forest, staring. I just turned around and quickly walked away then bolted when I got to the path

I've done LSA extracted in a solution before. I can't remember how much LSA it actually was, but my friend who extracted it said it was more in micrograms than a regular dose of acid, but would equal out to about half a dose of acid. It was my first time trying a traditional psychedelic as an adult and it was really chill. Opened my headspace, I saw some mild swirlys in a dark room. It made me comfortable trying LSD for the first time which I now do regularly. I'd recommend buying acid if you can but as a cheap similar legal high I guess it was fun. If LSD is sex, LSA is a handjob. Also I hear there's usually nausea but my friend is a straight up chemist and extracted it so it was pretty pleasant.

Typical hallucinogen experience, why would anyone pay for hallucinogens beats me.
It's like paying for a massage knowing you have a chance a big guy enters the room and breaks your ribs and puts you in the hospital. Nobody would pay for it, but psychtards are stupid like that.

Because the other side of the coin is beautiful visions and revelations about yourself. It's sometimes hard to deal with, but when it isn't it's incredible. That being said I've never had a really bad trip, just mildly bad, and haven't ever done really heroic doses, maxed out at like 225mcg acid.

>>73012135
Opiates will sap your sexual desires pretty quickly. alternatively and probably more healthily you could do a decent dose of acid or shrooms and try to introspect and find out why you're addicted to fapping, it'll help show you but won't fix you, as you'll have to apply the lessons you've learned 

>>73012272
That does sound delightful, I never went as far as heroin but have tried pretty much every pharma equivalent, except dialudid as I can't get that shit, but I do love a nice whisky.

Assuming one had access to these compounds:

3-HO-PCP
3-HO-PCE
O-PCE
3-Me-PCP
3-MeO-PCP
HXE HCL
3D-MXE

(you can additionally suggest something not on the list but please stick to one from it before as I can try these for sure)

which one would offer me the most ... positive manic thinking I understood the world and am on top of everything with my new esoteric abilities shizo trip? I haven't experimented with anything except ketamine from the disso class though sadly but It seems like I will get the ability to try one of these compounds so I gotta choose wisely. I'm kind of wishing for this weird feeling you get after redosing ketamine too often where you feel slightly shizo in the sense that you gained some sort of weird ability or like have access to some weird esoteric underlaying secret that makes up the dynamic of our world ... So I'm thinking the PCP/PCE core structures would be great at providing this? I do not wish to use that compound often but I would like it if it wasn't like esp habit forming or so unknown that its basically playing russian roulette. Also I'm a lil worried about 3-HO-PCP/E's mu receptor activity ... is that something to watch out for? Opioids always kinda scared me a little as its kinda easy to kill yourself with them compared to dissos. Ofc scale + volumetric dosing but like still idk no exp with these kinda drugs input highly appreciated.

(also psychonaut wiki fails with some of the more niche ones).

--- 73013259
>>73012863
>bruh there's like 200 drugs with known histories
What dissos are there then? (Besides ketamine and og PCP)? I don't like other drugs that much. I don't like mdma or psychedelics. Opioids I like but they are risky and stimulants are not that much "fun" rather useful. So yeah not that many disso compounds out there that are explored I did pretty much everything thats legal with disso action. I just love dissos they are my favorite and I want more and with MXE gone there only kinda is these left and even mxe was like chink as fuck thats why it dried up to begin with :|

yes but like the chance is very slim. Some people get something called HPPD or sth basically visual effects that never go away or lasting brain fog.

What's a good amount of tolerance break if my goal is less about my tolerance and more about my lungs? I've been smoking like a chimney for years and years and my lungs have about had it at this point, my coughing has been getting a lot worse lately. Few weeks, few months? Is there an amount of time that would give it almost like a reset? Been about two weeks without smoking but my lungs are still feeling it. Tolerance breaks are annoying and I always find it hard to keep to it, but I suppose I'll just drink some beers in the meantime since I haven't been able to find any psychedelics in a while. Anyone else here got foggy lungs?

Mindset and environment are important to consider. If you're already in a real bad way, tripping can make your thoughts more intense and scare you into a bad trip. Having a trusted friend act as a tripsitter might help, but I only was able to procure acid/shrooms after I had my own brain situation mostly sorted out, so I dunno how to really advise for mindset. As for environment, I always plan ahead on having something nice to do/watch set up and some nice snacks to eat, also I always stay home for my trips bc it's just easier and safer. For example if I was going to trip today, I would hook up my PS2 and play some Katamari or some Spyro (anything fun and simple with nice visuals), have some episodes of How it's Made ready or perhaps some pleasant nature documentary, and have some chocolates and pretzels and maybe some fruit to snack on, ideally all while in pajamas and a fuzzy blanket. Can't really go wrong with that kinda setup. Fuck, I wish I had acid right now.

>>73013628
That's a bit broad for some general feelsies bro..
The tar may be in your lungs but it's not as big a deal as statisticians would argue for medicine's sake.
The health industry doesn't dig the thought of letting big tobacco take over the growing marijuana industry (which is a no brainer) but every step away from tobacco's profit is a step towards priority export of tobacco and further marijuana state legislation.
While on the other hand, the health industry can spit out any number of updated stats in a day (on par with FBI/DOJ stats) to weave a narrative that can really leave the average Joe wondering.

Aussie cigarette packaging is brilliant, but a wild card reserve for import to a growing populous.

I mean it's true though isn't it? Not really sure what led you down your tangent. 

But smoking leaves gunk in your lungs, everyone agrees it takes years for that gunk to leave. The guy asked how long it would take for his lungs to clear out, for which the answer is years.

i don't actually think smoking cannabis leaves much in your lungs. a few years back i was in great shape and could run for hours, etc. and i smoked a bong every day heavily but i picked up smoking tobacco and only quit after about 2 years and i can barely run 10-20 minutes
--- 73015261
Can I get high off sugar pills?
--- 73015287

Nah yeah, I'll definitely have that given how much I smoke - like a moron if I'm being honest. I got a few years to spare. Folks who dabble with it from time to time like after sex? Occasional pipe? Bit a chew before hunting the predator?
It definitely will be worse for folks who labor their breathing which like stress can be a silent terror in the subco. Lotta peeps do it and it's not an age or sex thing but if you don't hear and feel yourself breathing, and feel your heart rate then you should be doing some breathing exercises more often.. while sitting, while laying, walking, running. Get your lungs and heart in syncopation with a good mental circadian rhythm and make sure your asshole is clocking in and out on time and the tar in your lungs will be history.

Also to add to what this guy said, it's very slow acting and a subtle drug, can take up to 6 hours to kick in properly and on 400mg you're unlikely to feel much at all other than a general sense of well-being. You don't blast off and get wasted on phen, you just get comfy and notice conversations and music are really fulfilling

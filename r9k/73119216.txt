What the fuck is wrong with women, guys? Is it normal for them to seem like they're suffering some mental disorder? How do they live like that? How do men put up with it without being driven insane?

Its just there way. Nothing more to be said about it, men were born with reason and women were born to remind him that the rest of the world world isn't rational and that he, insofar as he desires them, isn't all rational either.

Toxins and a lack of nutrients. In some ways they're worse off than men because they're more likely to eat a plantbased diet, more likely to be prescribed pysch meds, more likely to use antibiotics because of vaginal problems, they frequently use birth control, etc.

Like men don't suffer from a fuckton of mental disorders? Look at you! It's more of a symptom of a sick society and failing civilization.

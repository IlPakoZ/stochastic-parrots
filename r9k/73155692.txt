Redditors need to learn what "incel" means and stop making "cel" words and obscuring the fucking definition even more.
--- 73155755

What's your definition? Is it about being virgin? And female incels?
--- 73156057
>>73155755
Incel is short for involuntary celibate which is slang for a virgin living a life of celibacy despite not actively wanting or trying to do so.

escortcel is a fine term, when we think about incels we imagine people who cant organically get women to have sex with them or engage romantically with them, not people who are just incapable of buying sex.
--- 73156085
>>73155692 (OP)
Prostitutes are a massive blackpill because they give you an idea what Chad experiences guaranteed sex no passion no deeper feeling just pure carnal bliss I guess. It really makes you hate women alot honestly so much you actually begin to stop using prostitutes because you hate them so much.

>>73155692 (OP)
yeah it helped me and made me learn more about life. I have realized that I have hard anxiety and some erectile dysfunction. made me learn more about what a women is... I recommend for fellow incels and volcels to visit a whore or two.
>>73155755
volcel means voluntary celibate. Although I scared away couple of women I wouldn't call my self solely volcel. I believe my anxiety caused me to do that. Can I call myself an incel?

Was never the fucking solution to being an incel. Having to pay for fake attraction doesn't do anything for real attraction and it's illegal. 

You're asking people to go do something legally compromising just to tell normie sex-havers "YES I HAD THE SEX THING TOO BECAUSE I BOUGHT SEX PERSON" and then end going up to jail. 
Want to lose their virginity in the same the normies did it is not an unreasonable request. 

And it's not all about sex.
It's about relationships too.
You can't bring a fucking escort home to your parents or friends and claim it's your GF.

>does fucking prostitutes improve your life at all

No, not really. 

It helps "scratch the itch" for getting some action, but that's all. Life is still the same. 

I suppose it could help if you consider yourself an incel and think sex will save you. Once you fuck, you'll realize you still feel the same, and your anger/problems aren't directly related to just getting laid.
--- 73157104

>I think you approach the problem too directly, you've to solve your anxiety issues first.
Normie Sex-Havers have anxiety issues and get laid dude. I'm tired of trying to perfect myself as some completely flawless being and that doesn't get any attention from women.

I've done PUA.
I've done self improvement. 
I've done all that.
I don't have looks because I'm deformed or money because I'm broke and people block me from ever getting any more money.

Looks and money is all they care about, if I got magically rich tomorrow every girl who turned me down would immediately change her mind. 

>Otherwise wouldn't your first gf dump you for your neuroticism? That's something I fear a lot
Stop trying to perfect yourself since normies sure as hell don't go layers of self-improvement before they have sex either.
--- 73157289
>>73157104

What? I'm not telling you to rape anyone. Your logic is just fucking retarded.
Getting an escort but no girl wanting you besides through payment is incel.
--- 73158224
>>73155692 (OP)
It makes you realize sex is over rated and therefore you become much more relaxed around females and much less of a simp. Its also makes insults such as virgin now meaningless because everyone can tell if you lie about it. If you are a virgin you probably act weird around women subconsciously and its very noticeable with behaviors like staring or looking away quickly.

>>73156237
you and your morals beta
--- 73158260
>>73157845
I also find it funny. Most people who say that stuff have never been with a prostitute. Their only concept of a prostitute is the $2 crack whore in the ghetto. Of course, you can get ugly girls that give you terrible service, but you can easily find very attractive girls that give you great services and do a variety of different services.

not him but indeed, everyone with 200$ in their pockets is not an incel. wtf is an incel? involuntary celibate. thats it. only actual severe mentally retarded dudes who cant possibly comprehend the act of going online and making an appointment but still went through puberty and get horny are incels because they cant know any better. your amerifat 3rd world shithole disguised as 1st world is the only country i've been to where prostitution is illegal and i've been across quite a few in europe, south america and asia.

>ohh but the term has evolved! that's not what incel means anymore it now means the love of a girl to you the same love she has for chad

>>73158777
Ask away. but I don't know how accurately I can answer because I speak basically no Japanese. I think there are plenty of companies that do that. I can't remember any off the top of my head. When I was texting the tenchou for Robo-deli https://www.robodeli.net/top/explanation/ he explicitly told me that penetration is illegal. I did it with the girl anyways. Its expected.

How many brothels are gaijin-friendly? Are there brothels that just ban them outright, or is it a matter of just not accommodating people that don't speak Japanese? Also, are the picture usually up to date? In generally, how "scammy" are Japanese brothels?
--- 73158897
>>73158628
Definitions are useful because most people agree on what they mean. Most people don't consider paying for a hooker as a way to invalidate being an incel. Just like most people wont consider rape as a valid way to invalidate being an incel. Just like most people dont consider having gay sex on grindr as way which invalidates being an incel (if you are straight).
--- 73158906
I live near a legal brothel but I've never gone to one. Just feels gross, like paying for sloppy seconds
--- 73158917
>>73158826
>how many brothels are gaijin friendly
I couldn't say. There are thousands of sex related establishments. There are at least 10 soaplands in Yoshiwara that takes non-japanese speaking foreigners.
>Are there brothels that just ban them outright, or is it a matter of just not accommodating people that don't speak Japanese?
Many outright ban foreigners, but for many its just a language issue with understanding rules and stuff. Most of the time it depends the girl herself and what she's comfortable with. I've been turned away from that same Y-shirt before because they had no english accepting girls in that day. I couldn't say which way it skews more towards because I can't really test it myself.
>are the picture usually up to date?
Its kind of like roulette. I usually only go to places/girls that have reviews. I've had bait and switches before.
>in generally, how "scammy" are Japanese brothels?
Generally not scammy. Their business rely on reviews (in japanese for japanese) to build up a customer base. Bait and switching and scamming is a quick way to lose business. That being said, girls performances vary day to day. Some of the girls are like 10 years older than their profile says.

I think with time people's interest in things wanes honestly

I remember being in my teens and early 20s into video games but now haven't played in years and don't really care too

I've been banging escorts/brothel chicks in Tijuana since 2019, I started in the brothels and then did escorts in TJ specifically starting around 2020

2019 was the year I was introduced to the Tijuana redlight scene and was in fuck mode that entire year, since then though I realize that too much of anything can be bad so I've calmed down with that

My last escort I banged in Tijuana was like 2 months ago, a nice 19 year old I cuddled with after fucking, it was only $130 for an hour 

Some guys end up falling for these girls and want to sugar them and shit, but being blackpilled and 4channed I don't really feel anything for these girls

It's nice though to not have to deal with dating and all that swiping bullshit, I've met girls through apps and all that but with an escort you already know what to expect

I'll probably go back in the next two weeks

There are other things though aside from fucking girls that I'd like to accomplish like getting leaner and restoring my vision and fixing up my truck 

I also got into manga more recently, there's some I'd like to read

Is it worth it to lose your virginity to an escort?
--- 73159697
>>73155692 (OP)

Nah. Tried it once to technically lose the V-card and was like "Alright, that was fun but not worth the price". Still generally hate myself and my life.
--- 73159724
>>73159677
Depends on how much you hype it up and how the experience is, which isn't totally under your control. I was lucky and got a girl who walked me through it and eased my nerves (basically gfe). I've read countless stories of people who went cheap, or had reality not meet whatever their expectations were and felt like they "threw away" their first time.
I've never had a religious attachment to virginity and it just help me move past "being a virgin". I no long wonder "what is sex like?" or get wrapped up in trying to pursue it all the time.
--- 73159779
>>73159677
its not worth it because you will forever think of yourself as someone that had to pay money to have sex and you'd feel pathetic about it. If you stay a virgin at least you have dignity that you keep yourself clean and ready for a real connection
--- 73159797

after doing it a bunch i realised sex is really overvalued and i was wasting my money. also women in general are really way too entitled. 
like bitch i am paying you 100+ dollars for less than an hour and you are going to call yourself a queen and talk like everything must be on your terms, even though i only want very basic and typical services.
I've had really good hookers when i was 19, at a specific brothel, but after that place shut down, i never had an experience with a hooker that even came close to what I got there. I'm 30 years old now. So its quite rare. 

Either way, I conclude that even if its a negative experience, its potentially still a positive one in the long run because you realise bitches aint shit but hoes and other garbage.

The reason you think sex is overvalued is because you paid for it. You HAVE TO believe that. Same way that a whore with 50+ bodies has to believe that sex has no meaning. If you believe otherwise, that would mean admitting to yourself you engaged in an immoral act.

your assumption is that i've never had sex that i didn't pay for with money. i've also paid for sex with my time and efforts (i've had girlfriends before)

no i think its overvalued because whores with no integrity and who are bad at their job can charge that much. 
before i thought this, i paid whores who gave me good service for the same price, but i was just lucky then.
if it was cheaper it wouldn't be overvalued and i'd still be paying for it.

I worked night shifts at a hotel until recently. Most of the customers were tourists and people on business trips but you did have a dirty element to some of the guests since it was near a street full of shisha cafes and empty car parks teens/early 20s would hang out. Literally just me, a security guard who was asleep his entire shift except when he was talking to his relatives back in Ghana whilst eating fufu and a manager who would spend an hour with me but the rest in the office or outside smoking.
The hookers were usually alone but a few had a pimp. I was nice to them, even though it wasn't allowed I'd let their clients go up
>policy is to write everyone's name down and check for ID incase of a fire/accident
>people who aren't on the list cannot be allowed to go upstairs or use the lift
>guest must sign their tag alongs in 
 never treated them differently because they were whores or tried to flirt with them so I guess they thought I was the picture perfect teenage kid. They'd usually only ask me how I was doing and occasionally flirt for a bit when they're really bored. One talked to me all the way til 4am. A few did offer sexual advancements. There was this one Albanian girl who was a regular that had 4 guys on an average night. One shift she complained about the TV not working so I had to go up and see if I could fix it
>usually something wrong with that settings or a disconnected wire
She greets me with a shower towel on, grabs my hands and leads me into the room, lies down on the bed and stretches out as she tells me about her TV not working
>all the wires are obviously pulled out
>"Anon how am I supposed to entertain myself now"
Literally stands up naked. That's how I lost my virginity. For the rest of my university years I had sex with about a dozen different women at the hotel, 4 were regular hookers but 6 were normal guests. I had to leave now that I am about to get into my grad role. They all gave me tips and cried about me leaving.

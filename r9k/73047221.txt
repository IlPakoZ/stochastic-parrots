Narcissist or not, you do not come across as a warm or caring person or anything even remotely close. Your general demeanor is cold, slimy, and off-putting with a bit of deliberately being obnoxious to get under people's skin mixed in. Your anime girls are curated to seem smug and irritating, you never concede to a single point that anyone ever raises, you seem completely indifferent to the feelings and opinions of others. There is nothing even remotely likable about you and every single quality you possess is repelling.
--- 73048596

--- 73048603

Lol what did I do that made you write such a scathing review of me? I thought it was patently obvious that I love seeing seething retarded normalfags replying to my posts. If you have any arguments against my posts, I'd love to see them, dough.
--- 73048653
>>73048603
I don't understand what motivates you, really. It makes sense to hate "normalfags" if you are or used to be lonely and depressed, but you seem too empty and unemotional for that.
--- 73048676
>>73048603
Most of the people you anger are robots though. Normalfags seem to ignore you for the most part or not enter your threads at all.
--- 73048707
>>73048653
I don't hate normalfags. I love arguing in general, but when there is a purpose to defending someone or a group of people who is being treated unfairly in someway, then I'm motivated more towards that, and these arguments in general are quite easy, and most people's defenses of their positions are incredibly flimsy and easy to push over. I understand feeling unloveable to a degree, but not the same degree that incels feel it, and I think I understand hating normalfags LARPing as incels, which is very common here, and the hatred would be that much more if you're actually an incel.
I am very emotional and not empty at all, but obviously in my posts where I'm arguing like 20v1 or 1v1 with someone who clearly hates me, there is a front so I don't feel anything when people try to belittle me in 500 different ways.
>>73048676
You've never seen me argue like as like 80 posts out of a 500 reply thread, then. They're not threads I make most of the time.

Eh, yeah, maybe you're a narc after all. Or at least a conceited person with an inexplicable ego. You don't seem particularly intelligent and you only "win" inside your own mind because you're so arrogant that you believe everything you say is perfect and that anyone who goes against you must be wrong. You're young and I hope you become a better person one day; you are not a good one right now.

I'm indifferent to you for the most part. I do think you have an undeserved ego though. And driving that anon to cut himself and still pushing him afterwards for a while wasn't cool. As for the upperhand thing, I'm just calling it as I have seen it. Last night you went on forever for something that could have ended with a simple "You're right, my mistake." and would have probably made you the bigger person from the start.

You continued to mess with his threads and posts or invalidate his vents. Even after telling to stop several times. I don't know man, something about that just doesn't sit well with me. Personally. 

Was it not your mistake then? You wouldn't admit to it and just jumped to "You probably make spelling mistakes too! I'm so smart and high IQ that I won't waste mental energy to attempt to spell things correctly." I'm paraphrasing here of course. 
Also you spelled Hanukah wrong again.
--- 73049067
>>73049033
I will never stop making posts calling out normalfags just because someone on 4chan asks me to stop. If you're extremely mentally ill, I might stop with you, but not because you tell me to stop. Also, the point is I don't give a shit if I mispell one word. Nobody does at all. It was just a really pathetic attempt at an own, and implying someone is dumb because they mispell one word is very dumb in itself.

>>73049067
I understand where you're coming from but when someone is claiming to hurt themselves over your posts then why interact with that person at all after the fact? Entertaining them will only fuel them further.
Those are just my thoughts on the matter, what's happened already happened. You're free to do as you please of course but take into consideration that some actions have consequences. It's not a big secret that /r9k/ is known to attract the mentally unwell.
If you didn't give a shit you wouldn't have argued with the anons over it for who knows how long. Pathetic attempt at what? You did misspell the word. It happens, no big deel. Look, I just misspelled the word deal, and now I'll move on from it. If you call me out on it, I'll say thanks for the heads up and move on. What I'm getting at is that some battles aren't worth fighting over.
Have a good one.

How is she retarded? I don't know because she never says anything of substance. Getting her to be interesting is like pulling teeth.
--- 73049290
>>73049204
see that's the thing
when retard-san first debuted she would try to do the same shit tranny-kun does and argue with people since retard-san also claimed to be a high iq intellectual
the thing is that she would keep losing the arguments easily and getting btfo to hell and back. so much so that tranny-kun would have to step in her place because goddamn it was like shoving an unsuspecting tard down the stairs when you would argue with retard-san
so that's how he got the name retard-san in the first place
im pretty sure this is why retard-san doesn't say anything of substance anymore or tranny-kun told him privately that he'll handle it. we already know that tranny-kun dm's him to make a lovey dovey post about him on (pathetic isn't it? it doesnt even come from the heart) so it wouldn't surprise me
--- 73049492
>>73049290

Desuarchive search is down so I will summarize the lore for the latecomers. OP is Retard san, an AMAB mtf boymoder described as a cute girl with long beautiful hair and deep knowledge of WW2. She makes threads sharing the romantic story of how she met her soul mate, Tranny kun, on r9k in order to give hope to other true robots like herself.

Tranny kun is a bisexual chaseoid who crusades on behalf of true robots, defending their board from normalfags despite never claiming the robot identity for himself. He regularly wins 20v1 arguments against pol chuds which is why they invented the meme about him crumbling under scrutiny. 

Some have argued that their relationship is performative or unhealthy due to Tranny kun regularly prompting Retard san to make these threads about him or because he invalidates her lived experience as a lonely trubot but that criticism most likely stems from jealousy as Tranny kun has humblebragged about Retard san planning to dress as a maid and wear black lingerie for him when they meet at Retard san's grandparents for the next chapter of their love story. He strenuously denies any suggestion that Retard san's visit to his parents caused any shock or embarrassment and no diapers were found by his mother afterwards.

There is some confusion over whether Retard san will be presenting as male during the visit to Mexico as she has admitted she is not yet out to her grandparents and they are traditional Catholics. This will present no obstacles to their love because Tranny kun is bisexual. There is also some debate over when Retard san started self administration of HRT. The competing theories are that she is 23 and has been treating herself since age 19 or that she is 26 and began transitioning at age 22. It is generally agreed that she has had no surgeries so her feminine penis is intact.

You're conflating a few things. Me not stopping when someone asks me to stop I wouldn't do without a great reason, e.g. they're so incredibly mentally ill that can't stop themselves from reading my posts and it hurts them. I wouldn't expect 99.99% of people here to survive on 4chan if they can't learn to be okay with someone as unscathing as me who's just calling you a normalfag.
Also, nobody corrected me genuinely. They were saying I misspelled a word therefore I'm dumb, which is, in itself, a very dumb thought.

--- 73052617
>>73052466
>in order to give hope to other true robots like herself
>Tranny kun regularly prompting Retard san to make these threads about him
A large part of the point of the threads is to just be a cute thread to be appreciated and to make me feel loved. I do the same for her.
>against pol chuds which is why they invented the meme about him crumbling under scrutiny
I believe it was originally iris stans who invented this attack, and most of the debates aren't against /pol/tards, but just normalfags pretending to be incels/robots.
>he invalidates her lived experience as a lonely trubot
I did this only really very early on before we were in-love.
>planning to dress as a maid and wear black lingerie for him
This was a random idea but mostly is a joke. The plans are still in the works.
>strenuously denies [...]
This is implying I'm lying lol. Anything related to diapers is a total meme, and my brother and me got her from the airport, but there's a lie about my dad picking her up and being traumatized somehow.
>There is some confusion over whether Retard san will be presenting as male during the visit to Mexico
She'll most likely be in boymode.
The "competing theories" are both wrong since she started HRT at 18 and is 23 now. I don't think I've ever seen someone say she's actually 26 lol.

>And which one are you?
I am the chaseoid.

Literally every example you quoted you basically said "this is true but...".

You do ask retard san to make the threads and she does make them to give hope to robots, yes?
You do argue 20v1 defending tranners against chuds and there is a meme that you fall to pieces under cross examination, yes?
You reject that retard san was ever lonely and you reject her contention she is a robot, yes?
You do deny the embarrassing stories about diapers and your parents, yes?
Retard san will be presenting fully masc to her grandparents because she is not out, yes?

I can't see where the recap is wrong.

>>73052744
Do you know what a half-truth is? They're painting a picture far from reality due to the incompleteness/lack of necessary context.
Also, some of those are just outright falsehoods. He's incredibly obviously LARPing to quasi-defend me as a joke, but I don't regularly debate /pol/tards. I'm almost 100% sure that it's just a lie that there's a "competing theory" that she's 26 lol, or that she started at 19. It's false that the meme about me falling to scrutiny came from arguing with /pol/tards.
>You do deny the embarrassing stories [...]
This is such a dishonest way to phrase a question lol. Do you deny the embarrassing story that your mom caught you anally masturbating when you were 12? They're just really obvious imitators, at least most of the time, lol.

>>73052804
Boymoding = masc presenting. This is tranny studies 101. I expected you to know this but perhaps you are being deliberately disingenuous or obtuse. Again, you seem to be confirming the facts presented, but are unhappy with how they are being presented.
You have clarified that retard san has used HRT for five years beginning when she was 18. That is remarkably close to one of the competing theories. Hardly a strong argument against the veracity of the rest of the recap. Given the nature of r9k, I wouldn't be surprised if there were people who believed she started HRT much later after male puberty so it is perfectly believable there might be a competing, albeit wrong, theory based on misinterpretation or incomplete information.
I am quite confused over your fixation on the denial thing. It seems very straightforward. A claim is made, you deny the claim. Exactly as the recap says, no?
--- 73052983
>>73052928
>Boymoding = masc presenting
You said "fully masc," which doesn't really sound like when you just wear a hoodie and jeans or whatever like most boymoders who still shave, are on HRT, have long girly hair, etc.
>Hardly a strong argument against the veracity of the rest of the recap
One piece of misinformation isn't very much on its own, obviously.
>it is perfectly believable there might be a competing, albeit wrong, theory
There might be but it isn't being stated. That's not really an argument for how it's actually true lol.
>your fixation on the denial thing
There is no fixation. Saying I "strenuously deny" something is dishonest framing. None of this is strenuous at all lol, and I just flatly deny it since it's very easy for us to confirm when an imitator makes a post lol.
--- 73053060
>>73052983
So your argument that the recap is wrong boils down to you flatly, but not strenuously, denying a story and that you have not personally read a theory about your girlfriend starting HRT later in life...
It isn't a very strong case against the recap.
--- 73053100
>>73050750
you left out the best part of manuelitos based abuela deadnaming her/him
--- 73053113
>>73053060
A lot of the recap is fine but it's obviously very incomplete. I didn't say the whole thing is wrong, but yeah if you just don't care about dishonest framing/misinformation/half-truths, then yeah it probably seems pretty air-tight.

Personally it is the dick and balls that rule out the attractiveness for me. Pretty sure that starting HRT in her 20s doesn't help either
--- 73053611
>>73053211
>deadnaming
I don't get why they are so defensive about whether her gma refers to her as a man or uses her old name or whatever. They are open about the rest of the diaperfag degeneracy so what does it matter if the gma calls her a he??
--- 73053749

Well she's 23 now so she would only be on HRT for a few months. And it's generally just better to transition earlier for results.
--- 73054306
>>73054282
can I watch you two have sex while I cut myself please
--- 73054358
>>73054282
I guess I misunderstood. I thought the anon you quoted was saying that beginning HRT after puberty is pretty terrible whether it's at 18 or in early twenties.
--- 73054422
>>73054358
It's not ideal in either case but it's not necessarily "pretty terrible" in either case and it can very well make a huge difference. There is, in fact, a reason people keep repeating the lie.
--- 73054435
>>73054422
Im guessing the reason is >>73053749 ?
--- 73054467

>>73054467
Soooo going by the one you didn't rule out, it must be something to do with passing. I will ask someone more knowledgeable about the subject. With respect, you have a tendency to prevaricate rather than just answer a straightforward question which makes it seem like you are not very sure.
--- 73054599
Guys I'm starting to like retard-san, unironically.
--- 73054610
>>73054599
we should pay her money for making me cut myself
--- 73054640
>>73054595
Your question was dogshit lol. "does it have anything to do with this guy's explanation for why people aren't talking about her grandma deadnaming or not?" No it doesn't. He did talk about passing and it obviously relates to that as I heavily implied earlier.
>>73054599
Good taste.
>>73054610
She didn't make you do anything, though.
--- 73054641
>>73054599
just remember it's a actually a biological male and you like men but its okay.
--- 73054696
>>73054640
I am not the anon you quoted.
>like i heavily implied
This is what I mean. Why not just answer the question straight rather than go all around the houses? It makes it seem like you don't really know what you are talking about. Especially when you have to preface everything with lols and insults. Pretty common on here, I suppose. Anyway, if you aren't able to discuss the specifics of beginning HRT at different time periods after male puberty, we can just draw a line under your part in the conversation and allow someone who knows the subject a bit better to weigh in.
--- 73054742
>>73054696
>Why not just answer the question straight
Sure. That post was irrelevant.
>It makes it seem like you don't really know what you are talking about
If you genuinely think this based on what I said there, then I think you're most likely mentally unwell in some way and/or blinded by bias. Again, he basically asked me "does it have anything to do with this guy's explanation for why people aren't talking about her grandma deadnaming or not?" That's an incredibly stupid question with the only saving grace being that it was his mistake to link that post.
And yeah I'm obviously not an HRT expert lol. 18-19 yo's are often memed on /lgbt/ when they say "oh noez it's too late for me :'((((" but it depends obviously.

>>73054696
I am the OP of >>73004932 . I answered questions like yours a bunch.

Starting after puberty:
>it sucks, tbdesu, i mean i started at 19, which isnt AWFUL, (still possibiltiy of pelvic rotation/hip growth), and I was put on Adderall right before i turned 15 which has been shown to lower the potency of puberty which helped. and i was FAT during puberty which raises estrogen levels
but, transitioning after puberty is horrible. i constantly compare myself to youngshits (who started at like 12-15) and it ruins my day because of how good they look in comparison. but, at the end of the day, i started at 19, and not like 30.
>the more puberty you go through => the more testosterone your body is exposed to => the less likely to pass and its exponential
--- 73055156

Lol she's literally confirming what I said earlier.
>at the end of the day, i started at 19, and not like 30.
I never said or implied starting earlier had no effect. I was the one implying that starting at 18 is noticeably better than 22/23, and she's basically saying the same thing there.
--- 73055458
>>73055156
I was just about to say 
>Watch tranny kun desperately try to save face over being exposed as knowing nothing
Then I scrolled down and saw he had already replied scrambling kek
--- 73055493
>>73055041
Damn, retard san isn't fat and wasn't on adderal afaik so if that girl doesn't pass, it isn't looking good for OP.
--- 73055552
>>73055493
There are people who start at 19 and become perfect passoids relatively quickly, and there's that tranon who's an infamous attention whore on here and /lgbt/ and doesn't really pass. A lot of it is just genetics and have far greater of an individual effect than being fat/on adderal, lol. This is all just a really pathetic attempt to try to get under her skin.
--- 73055641
>>73055552
hide under anonymous all you want retard-san. youll never pass as a woman. 
why dont you ever post a selfie? Ill tell you why because you look like a fucking man. eat shit troon scum.

--- 73055893
>>73055552
>This is all just a really pathetic attempt to try to get under her skin
Why would discussions about the effects of taking HRT post-puberty get under her skin? This is a subject that she is obviously better placed than you to discuss, yet you keep insisting on inserting yourself in the conversation when you don't really have anything worthwhile to add. Very strange.
--- 73055929
>>73055893
I wasn't replying to anyone discussing how HRT works. That guy was just trying to get a dunk on my gf. You're either trolling or just really low IQ, desu.
--- 73056039
>>73055929
>That guy was just trying to get a dunk on my gf
You keep repeating that but not explaining why a discussion about how HRT works would be a dunk for someone who is using HRT... Adding an insult on the end doesn't make it any more true, or add anything to the discussion. You have already shown your ignorance on the subject yet keep replying anyway. As soon as we got someone knowledgeable in, you had to chime in again, adding nothing. Is it a need for the last word? If so, I am happy to give it to you because it seems important to you. Strange. I won't reply to you again unless you do some research and actually bring something worthwhile to the conversation. 
>>73055041
If you or OP are still watching the thread, I would be very interested in discussing your experiences of completing male puberty prior to beginning your hormone replacement journey.

--- 73056382
>>73050750
Since the archive is back up and running, we should supplement this summary (bearing in mind the caveat that "strenuously denies" should be replaced by "flatly denies" moving forward).

I believe that this post >>72981552  may be the origin of the contentious competing theory which Tranny kun took issue with. It seems that some anons (wrongly) interpreted Retard san's post to mean that she was alone for 22 years before beginning HRT. Now we have had confirmation, this theory can be dismissed and the record can be updated to show that Retard san began her HRT at age 18 until present. It is good that we have settled this because it does, understandably, seem to have been a particular bugbear for the couple.

What are robots thoughts on picrel? It does seem that the maid uniform and black lingerie is a flirty joke between lovers but Tranny kun later confirmed the 'mostly' joke had evolved into a real plan. Should we remove the maid uniform from the lore or are we satisfied that they will be enjoying some erotic lingerie while staying in Retard san's grandmother's home?

It's a non-passing tranny, you are their superior.
--- 73056610
>>73056565
We don't know her real name, only her deadname. I would prefer if we didn't use it in this thread, though. My understanding is that Retard-san's family still use it because they are not supportive of her truth. All of us should make an effort to maintain this board as a safe space where Retard-san doesn't need to worry about anyone deadnaming her.
--- 73056641
Here's some more lore:

>Retard-san cried once when she was 3 when she lost on a videogame
>Retard-san is 4'8, Tranny-kun is 7'0
>Tranny-kun's parents both look younger than their age. Tranny-kun's dad was a Gigachad when younger with 17 girlfriends at the same time.
>Retard-san almost died in 2011 due to choking while eating a piece of birthday cake and entered a six week coma

Did we find out whether Retard san's grandma still calls her by her birthname or are they both still ducking the question? Is that solid enough for us to include it in the confirmed lore?
--- 73056803
>>73056784
She's boymoding. That means she's completely hiding the fact that she's trans. Using a female name would give away that something's up. So yes, deadname.

I think people are often very biased in how they judge character.
If you agree with me about how normalfags LARPing as incels is bad, then you might like that side of me where I argue against 20 of them at a time and tear through them one-by-one with ease. Some people liked me for this until they realized I had a gf and then they hated me, and also /pol/tards will just hate me since my gf is trans and I'm a progressive.
I take it when someone is harshly judging my character here, they're basically saying "I really disagree with you, but I'm too much of a coward to actually argue, so I'll ad-hom you about how you're a sociopath/narcissist/hypocrite/tranny/dumb/etc." Your ad-homs always fall flat since I know they're false and ultimately just come from your cowardice.

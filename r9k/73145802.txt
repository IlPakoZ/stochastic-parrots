Even as an adult, are you still afraid to express your feelings for someone? Don't you think it'd feel better to be courageous, even if you get rejected?

There's unfortunately a disconnect with what I want to do in my brain and what I want to do in my soul.

I was courageous and I got rejected. Then I was courageous again and it was mutual, bitch is better looking than last (at least to me).
Wagmi anones, just persist

If I expressed my feelings I would be assaulted or imprisoned. No one would want to hear what I have to say about them

Do you know how women reject men nowadays? There's no reason to willingly accept such humiliation.

I don't like having feelings and I find it hard to locate them most of the time.

Can't things progress more naturally though? You don't need to do a japanese back-of-the-school style confession. Although admittedly asking a woman out is fairly direct.

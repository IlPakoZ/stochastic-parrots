"Virgin" doesnt mean anything. Ive talked to girls who were "virgin" and they all had sucked cock, swallowed cum, sent nudes and got naked on cam. One even had been ducked in the ass. Dating is cucked. Be a man and buy a child bride from afghanistan or just fuck and dump white hoes
--- 73115119

id probably not wait for marriage because i think physically intimacy is important in a succesfull relationship. i would date another virgin, i would prefer that

I'm curious as well. Obviously virgins exist, but the question is mainly whether legal virgins exist. I just played an old eroge where most of the 20-something cast were virgins, when I'm pretty sure that nowadays by the time a girl's 18 she's fucked 2 guys at least.
--- 73115369

Would a wirtten schedule help or do you need someone to actually tell you? Is this a fixable problem(through therapy or meds)? Do you think you could be a mom? I can say I wouldn't mind dating someone like this, having people rely on me makes me happy.

The likelihood of meeting a virgin is low, dating one is even lower. Most likely none of us will get a virgin if we can, women are losing their virginity before they graduate. The small town christian archetype is dying out unfortunately, but if you can you are blessed imo

Surely you've spaced out thinking about other things before and had someone call your name, but you didn't register it. It's not like you heard your name being called and ignored it, you just didn't notice that someone was trying to talk to you.

Imagine that spaced out haze where you're unaware of the world/problems around you, except it's all the time. Unless it's immediately in your focus or blocking your line of sight it simply doesn't register. It's not that you noticed it and ignored it, the noticing never happened in the first place.

How can you fix what you don't even notice? That's what the problem is. She doesn't notice big problems the same way you might not notice a single wrinkle in your shirt or couple hairs pointing out in an asymmetrical direction.

I met a girl who sounded similar to her online. It was a surreal experience, I was invited over to play video games together and she just sat and played the Sims literally for hours, totally zoned out, even though I had brought some new shit she seemed interested in trying. I was fascinated, just sat there and waited to see what would happen. It's like she had completely forgotten that she had invited me over and that I didn't exist. Meanwhile her grandmother is in the room and is basically watching me the whole time, also saying nothing, but always watching.

About two hours in she just announces that she's hungry, gets up and recognizes that I exist. I couldn't just sit there in awkward silence with the grandmother, so I followed her to the kitchen. She assembles a peanut butter (no jelly) sandwich, puts everything away and starts eating it. I just sit there, it's back to that spaced out haze where I don't exist. It simply didn't register in her head that if food is happening it should be offered to a guest, and that it would be totally inappropriate for me to just start dishing something up myself.

I was able to redirect her to setting up the game I brought to her room. She starts playing, I sit next to her. Can't catch a read on what the correct social response is. If I say something she doesn't hear it or respond to it. I try to give a tip or explain something and no response. If I put an arm around her there's zero reaction, just completely focused on this new game and nothing else exists.

She's probably not quite that bad, but it's probably a lot of the same kind of thing. Nothing really bothers her, nothing gets noticed or is considered worthy of immediate attention. Take all the fine details you don't notice in life and expand that feeling to include all the most basic things needed to function, like buying food. I'm convinced that if the food wasn't there she would basically go "oh, I guess I'm not eating then."

I am. But I'm introvert, aspie, overweight, sick and with low interest in sex and high romantic standards, so that's was not so hard to stay virgin.
--- 73116143
they exist, but certainly not on tinder, social networks and generally places where normies congregate. they live fairly invisible mode lives, which is why they are virgins in the first place.

my gf was a virgin before me at 20, spends most of her days inside reading about STEM topics and computer science. its not really possible to *meet* her by chance. unless you are in her university class (but even for lectures, she avoids visiting them in presence) or she goes out of her way to meet someone.

In school that's literally how it works. I fucked picrel when she was 15 and a virgin, lost mine to hers too. Every single girl in our class had lost their virginities by the time they hit 17 or 18 at most. So unless you fucked while still in HS your chances of ever fucking a virgin, let alone have a relationship with one, in a natural environment are really fucking low.

Now femcels, sheesh. I wouldn't touch incels with a 10 foot pole if I was a woman, so being a man, I wouldn't see femcels as romantically or sexually viable partners, we're just too different.

I'm sure for the myriad of guys in this board an aspie shut in virgin girl that has zero friends is probably the dream girlfriend but that sounds like torture to me lol. I wouldn't date a shy girl, let alone a mentally ill shy girl.

Non-troon 20 year old virgin who's never been in a single relationship here. I think it's probably hard to find virgin women since we don't get out much. Think of what you do all day, that's what your female counterpart does too. Except there's more fanfiction writing involved.

Not and never have been a feminist. Though I do think guys could maybe benefit from genuinely good female role models (not the snarky, lecturey, misandrist type kikewood loves, like actually kind women who show empathy and appreciate you and respect men and show both sexes have their own good traits and flaws, that type of thing) because it is a shame that the type of guy I wish I could hang out with assumes all women are either roastie whores or radical feminists who want to cut their nutsacks off. Something that really pisses me off, is when something bad about women is pointed out, instead of refuting it or anything, feminists just go "YEAH SO WHAT? [insert horrible thing] IS ACTUALLY EMPOWERING AF". Like no, abortion is a really shitty thing and I'm sure most women don't take it as lightly nor treat it like a human right as the vocal social media tards do. Same for other stuff they smear the whole sex with, like onlyfans whoredom.

Don't have chad standards, just want a guy who won't freak out over racist jokes (hard mode in this cucked country) and who wouldn't mind extensive animation and vidya sperging. Grew up quite oblivious to normie standards since I didn't socialize much, so none of the stuff you guys worry about like height, baldness or fancy cars bother me at all.

I hope this post doesn't come across as "me me me" narcissistic, the point I'm hoping to make is lots of women who are the same way exist too, but the only ones you hear about are absolute degenerates who brag about aborting their babies and cheating eight times in one night on their loving, devoted bf, because they get given the biggest platform. I just hope this is a whitepill.

Heh this might be a bait or whatever but I'll shoot my shot. Gotta roll the dices in life right?
I haven't been on /r9/k in like 8 months until tonight so if I do get a gf out of this, it would definitely be fate...
Alright here goes
I'm 21 yo, uni student, Canada. I work part time and have enough money to enjoy my hobbies but I'm not a big spender by any means (probably why I have zero debt)
I'm 5'8, white, light brown hair and green eyes. I've been told I look rather youthful which I take as a compliment. Never been in a relationship because im shy and I'm a bit autistic.

My main objective is double-sided.
Firstly, I want romance. I want to be able to truly love a girl, to never even glance at another woman again and to devote myself to her and make her feel special. I want to court her. I want to have a partner I can trust, truly love and grow old with.

Secondly, my limited experience with women as kinda exhausted me on them. All the scheming, the surface-level appreciation of anything, the fakeness. I want a girl I can talk to like a buddy. A girl I can affectionately call retarded and etc. Racist jokes and the likes are welcome.

Main hobbies are vidya, history, kino and posting on the internet.

Contact info is the following discord: Farouche#1930. I'd like to talk and see if we would match and go from there. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. I don't want to promise anything because I do value the concept of a first gf and want to make sure its someone special.

If I never hear from you or anyone, thats okay. I see this as scratching a lottery ticket (which I never do irl because its a scam, ironically) and maybe since its my first time on r9k in 8 months theres a reason I saw this post. Maybe.

Nah, I don't like interacting with men when they know I'm a woman. I would only want to talk to women from here.

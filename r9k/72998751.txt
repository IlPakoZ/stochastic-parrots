I'm a 24 year old Femanon (not femcel since they don't exist). Also a neet with no social interactions and it's getting to me pretty badly. I can't leave my house a lot because of health issues. I collect old video game for 6 years (pic is a part of my collection but i got more) and built gunpla for fun.

2 they are from my ex boyfriends I had when I was 16 und 18
--- 72998920
The last neet I was friends with made me think we were super close chatting every day for 3 years and then ghosted me out of nowhere. I have pretty big trust issues now when it comes to both woman and neets. But you'll have no problems finding "friends" here.

Figures. You think it's okay to financially support Goodsmile? A company with links to the far right hacker website 4chan?
--- 72998999
>>72998983
She was the first figure I bought and now I got so many starting to run out of space
--- 72999037
>>72998994
Mh that's hard but I think just like artists I separate the art from the artist. But mostly buy them used
>>72998993
No I'm definitely like other girls i would say
--- 72999048
>>72998985
I have a lot of those but some of mine are badly broken
Game cube: i couldn't get the case of because of safety screws the disk wouldn't spin, so I ripped the case of and played the game without the case. (stupid I know)

I found a SNES boxed in someones trash and took it home. it was badly yellowed but worked with the GameCube power pack, think I have Earth Worm Jim 2 boxed for it.

PS2 boxed the fat one, but the controller no longer works

PS1 boxed but that has yellowed in part

I really should have made a set up like yours
--- 72999062
>>72998994
lol i'm going to buy more now
--- 72999066
>>72999048
That's really cool! The yellowing can be remove if you are willing to put in the work but I think you need special screwdriver for that
--- 72999069
>>72999037
How do you afford so much stuff anon as a neet 

Kind of jealous you still have all your old consoles and games and stuff though lol

It's ok people are pretty closed off and I'm in the countryside its pretty nice here but the major citys are hell or at least Frankfurt and berlin
--- 72999207
>>72999177
>major citys are hell

Is this because of the amount of people or because it is violent and full of criminals?
--- 72999217
>>72999207
Full of drugs you can see them everywhere and junkies in general are a huge problem lot's of place were you could skate 10 years ago are full of homeless people now

Looks like you have a feminine digit ratio too so idk why that guy is saying it's manly

Sound like everywhere these days, my areas in the UK it has gone to shit, litter all over the streets, near the local shops are full of beggars and people selling drugs,

 When I go to work in the mornings I see people looking in peoples businesses and walking around looking for cigarette ends on the floor

This is why I stay indoors on my days off
--- 72999316
>>72999292
Mh oh well it's 4chan but a person in my family said i should transition because I'm into guy stuff and in general dress like a tomboy
--- 72999317

Omg it's the megaman spin-off right? I wanted to play that after finishing final fantasy tactics advanced that's so cool!

I think so? An anime use air and they made video games based off of it, here's the trailer: https://youtu.be/5anP8oC-ePY [Embed] 

It was my favorite series on that handheld system.
--- 72999600
>>72999585
It's ok the sad part is that i hade to give up skating.

sorry, I can't be friends with someone that didn't miss out on teenage love
--- 72999640
>>72999612
Team colonel, megan blue and the cybeast were my favorites. I feel like this series was criminally underrated. Tbf, in my eyes it went to to toe with pokemon and was arguably better.
--- 72999645
>>72999631
Awe sorry anon I hope you can find someone else 
>>72999640
Yea that's always a sad fade a lot of good games just didn't sell good enough and got canceled

Are you a virgin too? Because I am a 24 year old khhv femcel and I am trying to determine if we would make good pals

Was thinking about it when i have money again sounds like real fun
--- 72999733
>>72999720
Sadly no but it's been years since then like a good 7 years
--- 72999753
>>72999721
It is unbelievable to experience, there are some games that feel like demos but you can find some fun ones, I really like just finding worlds to sit in and explore.

If you are good at designing you can pretty much build and design your own game (Dreams)
--- 72999762
>>72999733

That means you are a virgin again lol

Was thinking because I'm used goods that no one would want me. i also only got hit on by older men whats kinde wired because i look so young
--- 72999885
>>72999805
I was joking about the virgin part but some people seems to say it, Yeah the worlds are really engaging .

I first tried out the VR Worlds and there is a Fun underwater cage demo with fish and a shark at the bottom, that got me hooked. Now i'm downloading games and testing them all to find the best ones.
If I find a good one I buy the physical copy
REZ was the one I got from America was a little more expensive but i'm happy I bought it
Some games with zombies are pretty much a "NOPE!" not touching that and I throw the VR headset and sit there sweating
--- 72999893
>>72999867

it doesn't work like that in this world, girls get 100% attention and you might not feel it but you can never be unwanted.

I remember them being married and i could be there kid was wired.also always get asked for id when i buy alcohol. Kinda uncomfortable when they see I'm over 18
--- 73000105
>>73000074
That game was phenomenal at scaring the crap out of me. I don't think I could play it in VR but I loved the first one, just swimming out into deep water and then hearing that sound of the Reaper
--- 73000119
>>73000105
Fucked ne up good but kinda love that feeling of being scared that's why i love horror games or dark games
--- 73000129

Imagine that in vr I would die of a heart attack
--- 73000168
>>73000150
The only way I can use it in PSVR is with only a big screen inside the headset, like being at the cinema in your own home, not proper VR but seeing that would make me fear for my life. I would love it tho
--- 73000182
>>73000168
It's amazing how was technology advanced so far now i really want a vr
--- 73000201
>>73000182
Sometimes when my friend stays at mine (he drives me to his work to gain more work hours) I set up the VR for him, and he loves it, I just let him experience the games, truly is the future of gaming
--- 73000221
>>73000182
Go on ebay Germany and see how much they are going for, The last time I looked they were really cheaper,
Just make sure it's the PSVR2 version for PS4 and get the move controllers

I love sharing my games did that a lot when i was way younger then now

Yeah when I was in high school and college I used to have everyone at mine, it was a local pit stop for people, we all used to play games about 10 people squashed into a small room, I miss it but everyone has to work
--- 73000256

I want to work again really badly and just buy games and other stuff. Kinda funny how i disliked work and now i miss it
--- 73000289
>>73000256
That is exactly how I felt when Covid happened, I was working then we got shut down by the government and all their rules got me fired because ehe business couldn't run, so I just played games for a year and lived inside my home, then when we were allowed back out I was so happy to get a job again and buy more games. Funny how I always hated going work now Love it
--- 73000356
>>73000289
Was a shit time if I'm honest. God i have to clean the house today but i want to play games
--- 73000394
>>73000356
I don't mind just being alone and doing my own thing, that's why i'm on here, it's alone and peaceful, I don't need to be that guy for everyone. I can come and go as a please and interact on my own terms. Sure sometimes I get that itch to be with people. Clean your house you filthy urchin!! joke 

Do both, with your bad knees you can take do it in small stages. start with the smallest place that needs cleaning, then play a game for an hour, then do the next clean
--- 73000433

Since I'm not working right now and still at home duo to covid I do all the cleaning in the house it's helping a bit with moving my knee

>>73000433
Can you not do squats? like I know it will hurt to do a small number of squats, it could make it move better, and take Glucosamine &amp; Chondroitin that is meant to help knees, yeah i'm not advising you to do any of my crazy ideas, in case you get hurt

Yes just ignore me
--- 73000561
>>73000540
They mostly only wear them in bavaria not where i am but i did wear one and it's pretty cool there. I had to quit because my knees got worse (both kneecaps are operated on a few years ago but still hurt). Hate being a neet i kinda miss work a lot and not staying alone at home. I miss just basic interactions with people and i see no one expect my parents. I don't have to pay for food or rent but I do all the cleaning at home
--- 73000565
>>73000544
Nah all good. I'm slowly training so that i can do more and more with my knees. Started with simple walks need to train the muscles so that i can do squats and all that stuff
--- 73000580
>>73000561
i assume you talked to a doctor about it? does it hurt when u sit?

I have no solution for you as a 28 year old friendless female neet.

I know how it feels OP

It's not that bad as it might set you up with a comfy office job, considering you can't even waitress with that condition. But as I said, make the best out of your time as neet or you'll regret it badly in a few years. Speaking from experience.

i meant no computer* also its probably better 1 on 1 because in a group chat or general chat you have weird oribting behavior or youre an outsider and cant get a word in

Men and women can't be friends they will always want to fuck us even if they pretend they don't even if they have a gf. They want to fuck us

Was thinking about learning polish since i am half polish but it seems hard. Was learning korean but those damn kpop fans ruined it for me. Love there fashion and wanted to stay there for a year to see something different. But no kpop fans ruins it for me

Yea was thinking to work in a library or archive. 
>>73000894
That's true sadly 
>>73000902
I think because we are closed up and pretty cold and stressed out maybe

I dont know what to say but that is unfortunate to hear about your situation. If you cannot leave the house try to crack open a window every once in a while as it will help

What health issues wouldnt let you leave your house that sounds awful

Oh god I think I drank way too much, I used a Kaltenberg two pint glass full of protein milk


Kingdom hearts 3 picture?
I loved that game, even if it was hated

>>73000894
You seem to think quite highly of yourself, I'm friends with some women and don't want to fuck them. I already have a gf, I don't want to downgrade by cheating on her. Any armchair psychology cope you come up with doesn't change this.
--- 73000936
>>73000894
>they will always want to fuck us
Let's assume this is 100p true, this doesn't mean they will push for it. If they make sexual comments or whatever, I get not wanting anything more to do with them if they are relentless. Can you not have a friendship with that in mind? Also, can you just become friends with a really good looking dude? Chances are, he probably won't find you attractive or just rather fuck a bunch of other girls.

Knees are fucked walking currently hurts a lot it's sad too look outside sometimes seeing all the birds and deers makes me want to go out. 
>>73000918
Yea would be nice!

I need to play 2 first but then i will play 3 can't wait! And don't drink so much haha
--- 73000944
>>73000931
Instead of being aggressive, can you not approach her with solutions?
--- 73000956
>>73000944
Can you not fuck off and mind your own business? That's a better idea, simp cunt.

Stop derailing because reality makes you butthurt
--- 73000964
>>73000894
This is completely untrue, I've been friends with tons of women and don't want to fuck them. Do I want to see them naked? Sometimes, but that's just because I like looking at attractive women and it gives me a rush.

Ok done i send it hope you get it
--- 73001053
>>72998751 (OP)
That looks quite cool! Hope you can make some friends you seem to be nice.
Asking for a friend.. would you (try to) become friends with someone you don't really share interests with? This friend of mine doesn't really have any interests and as a result he has nothing to talk about with anyone..
--- 73001054
>>73001038
Yea collecting really long now
--- 73001073
>>73001053
Of course! We don't need to have the same interests to be friends and theres for sure other things to talk about

How is this derailing? Both her and OP want friends and ignoring have the population will make this harder than it needs to be.
--- 73001114

How do I ignore someone?
--- 73001149
>>72998751 (OP)
Hi im a 25 yo femanon and you seem cool. I would like to be friends
--- 73001150
>>73001149
Yes would be cool do you have discord?
--- 73001157
>>73001114
I don't understand your question. I was just saying refusing to be friends with the opposite sex cuts your chances down to half.
--- 73001182
>>73000941
Okay, thats a good thing, at least it isnt respiratory etc. Do you have a porch or something? Set up a lawnchair outside maybe? 

My girlfriend is a physiotherapist, if you want ill put my discord down and i can ask her about your condition and if she recommends anything to help.

Fuck anon you have a really nice collection, you have some shit I've considered buying but decided against like the japanese GBC games and the rem and gawain statues how recently did you get that Alm amiibo? I've been trying to find Alm and Celica since they came out and could never find them in any store.
--- 73001219
>>73001157
But i don't ignore the opposite sex i just don't get to know anyone anymore 
>>73001182
I'm sometimes sit in the garden but i just get lonely because my parents work all day and I'm alone
--- 73001226
>>73001205
I got them randomly quite some time ago in a store!
--- 73001277
>>73001226
Well shit, I probably won't have much luck then. I bought the game when it came out and really fell in love with it, I had only played the GBA games and nu-fire emblem when it came out and to this day remake Alm is my second favourite lord, and Celica a cute. Do you actively go around and buy stuff for your collection or just add to it randomly?
--- 73001286
>>73001205
Love figures so much the spice up every part of my collection got a really big card captor sakura one
--- 73001316
>>73001277
Activity looking for stuff especially flee markest and sometimes ebay or stores
--- 73001332
>>73001286
Oh shit, post your Sakura anon! I've been wanting to buy a Sakura figure for a while but just can't bring myself to do it, I only have 3 DB statues I keep on display and I feel like if I buy any more people will start asking questions.
--- 73001415
>>73001316
Nice, you find anything good recently or looking for something in particular that's evaded you for a while? Right now I'm looking for Bloody Roar for the PS1, I've got primal fury, extreme and 3 and I'm hoping to have the entire series in a few years. I haven't had much luck though, mostly just been buying niche switch games I find for cheap at the nearest used games store and going to a really big retro Vidya sale that happens one every few months in my area, I'm hoping they'll have a sega saturn one of these days, I had one as a kid but sold it when I was 14 for a couple hundred dollars with panzer dragoon and I regret it immensely.
--- 73001463
>>73001332
There you go! I love her so much big passion for her 
>>73001415
Currently smt games i love them so mich but some of them cost a ton and sega saturn is on my list of stuff i need

This is my figure collection so far, I just preordered the Guyver 2.0, but those are so expensive now, I haven't bought for a few years as of COVID
I hopefully can set up a room like yours with all my stuff but where I live we get broken into so I am keeping everything in boxes and MISB

I think I need to be sick, OMG why did I think I was so clever, I can't even move, I think I am gonna try and afternoon nap for an hour

take care Germananon

>two sakuras
I'm insanely jealous, I was actually thinking about buying the one on the right yesterday but I can't afford it this month... I just started watching Sakura a few months ago and it's honestly one of the comfiest shows I've ever watched, it looks amazing and it's just so nice, I hate that my first magical girl show was madoka and it turned me off from magical girls for a few years. 

What SMT game are you playing right now? I just recently start 5 because my friend said it was pretty gud and I never bothered to beat it, and I'm thinking of maybe playing last bible 3 soon.
--- 73001563
>>73001517
You too have a nice nap and the figures are so cool!
--- 73001576

I've heard nocturne is really fugging good, I've been meaning to play it but I can't find a copy anywhere and I don't know how good the remaster is so I'm not touching it. though I haven't found any copies of nocturne I've gotten 2/4 of the original .hack// games CIB so I can't complain too much about my luck with PS2 games. I refuse to emulate anything for some godforsaken reason unless there's a translation patch and my wallet suffers for it.

I wish I could've grown up watching Sakura, you're lucky anon but I probably started collecting vidya at an earlier age :^)
You ever sell any of your collection? I've got an extra copy of pokemon XD I've been tempted to sell but I don't know if it's worth it.

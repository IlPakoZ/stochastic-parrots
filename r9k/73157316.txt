What are some other dirt cheap but nutritious options? Rice, beans and sardines(or tuba) is very cheap and covers almost all nutrients you need

Also for eggs, 2 bananas and 2-3 boiled eggs is really good and cheap too

Is hamburger meat still cheap? If so, Hamburger Helper. Lived off that shit for a couple of years.

Yeah, you can still get 3 pounds of 80% lean beef for like $10-15 at least around here. If you dont give a shit about leaner meat you can get the 70% for less, but unless you use the fat that cooks off then may as well go as lean as you can for as cheap as you can

eggs. they are more expensive than before but still eggs. they got damn near everything. if you are younger than 21 then you should be drinking milk too, it promotes growth of all kinds

The cost should start going down now anyway since the avian flu kill off was some time ago and egg laying populations get back towards normal. Provided companies dont use this as an excuse to permanently keep the prices hiked since people will pay

Filet mignon and steamed lobster with lemon asparagus and seasoned mashed potatoes. Great meal if you need something cheap.

Some of the less popular but still lean and tasty beef cuts actually are really good, like tri tip or some of the sirloins(i forget which one). Also pork chops are leaner than most beef cuts and wayyyy cheaper, and just as good if made right in my opinion. Also also catching your own wild fish is a great option, crayfish should be out in droves as the water warms up now and you can literally just grab them

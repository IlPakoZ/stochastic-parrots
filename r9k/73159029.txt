i'm fucking sick of it. i have an actual 8-9/10 face and a decent body, but i don't slay like chad at all. i'm very much incel in thought and demeanor.

i think it's for two reasons: i'm only 5'9", and i'm pretty mentally ill (i have moderate bpd). am i blowing these out proportion, or am i eternally cucked by my height and mental state?

i have a tinder and get matches and messages like crazy, but i don't ever respond because i'm afraid they're expecting someone with chad's confidence or someone at least 6ft tall.

any other chad mentalcels/heightcels?

you're not going to "slay" at 5'9" and anyone who tells you le epic anecdote of "that one guy i know" is a dishonest gullible retard. you have to be content with chad's broken sloppy fourths.

okay so 5'9" is unequivocally manlet territory, just so i'm aware?

>i'm fucking sick of it. i have an actual 8-9/10 face
stop humblebragging

i'm not humblebragging, what good is my face if i don't ever have sex and women are revolted by my autism. i'm just trying to give a complete picture.

>>73159122
it's called overestimating himself

I'm like 5'11.75" but just say 6', 5'9 isn't that short it's average in this country

If you have a pretty face 5'9" is ok, women will still like you if you're cruel and dumb.

I'm similar in all respects and used to have the same problem. Don't put too much value into messaging them, just think of it as a numbers game.

Also, women are not stupid: if you did not proactively include your height in your bio, most will have already assumed you are of average-to-below-average height. As such, in 90 percent of the cases if they've already swiped right on you, your height is a non-issue so long as you are not a dwarf, which you aren't.

you're probably painfully average in the eyes of women anon

Forgot to mention if they message you first, it's a pretty good indication that they will skip a date and go straight to casual sex if you play your cards correctly.

>>73159219
i appreciate where you're coming from, but i'm objectively at least an 8. i've had many cases where strangers call me beautiful and give me attention, only for me to ruin it with my autism

>>73159211
thanks for the advice anon, that helps me feel a little better if what you say is true

>>73159204
i'm dumb but i'm not cruel, though i wish i were for that reason
--- 73159313
>>73159281
really? how would playing my cards correctly look? again, i don't think i'm chad enough to somehow convince them to fuck me right away.

Be aggressively flirtatious and keep that energy ratcheting up throughout the course of like 4-6 messages and then find a way to get her number/snap. At no point should you be discussing shit like how your day has been.

Above all accept the fact that you're gonna fumble some baddies. In fact, you should send like five of the hottest women in your matches completely retarded openers right now to get yourself used to the idea of failure and being cringe. Happy hunting

You don't have to be cruel just act that way. Make fun of them. Practice doing this with girls on Tinder chat first.
--- 73159527
>>73159415
There are no attractive men or women on tinder.

I know how you feel. I used to be an incel manlet all my life... until I started to wear shoe lifts. Now I'm swimming in pussy
--- 73159627
>>73159580
aren't you afraid of being found out once you take your shoes off?

4 fucking cents. I went to the store to buy a jelly pack and then I saw that there was really tasty looking glass bottle juice with water melon and apple flavor. I immediately grabbed both of them, went to the cute goth looking cashier and gave her the things to scan them. 

Guess what? The sum was 4.14$. Do you know how much I had with me? Try to guess. 4.10$. Fuck, not only did I not get my sweet nectar and went home only with jelly but I also pretty much dropped my spaghetti in front of a decent looking person. Fuck me

She didn't let it slide? Where the fuck do you live bruh
I always insist on telling the cashiers to keep the product if I don't have enough and they let me have it even if I'm 10 cents short

sucks OP. I went to the vape shop to pick up some packs and left my card at home. just brought my 20 cause I was stoned as fuck. total came to 20.33. guy just gave it to me, told me not to worry about it. 

I'm sure if you had a male cashier who understands the struggle, you would've gotten your water melon juice or whatever for 4.14. #brokeboys

She's an asshole for not just accepting the $4.10. The other day I rang up $5.03 at Wawa and the cashier (also a cute goth type) let me get away with a $5 bill.

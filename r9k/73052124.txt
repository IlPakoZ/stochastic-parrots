He can likely get laid, just that the woman that'll fit his type won't be cis.

Either you're a zoomer, an American, or both. Thinking fat people are attractive is a fucking massive cope from a blobby, flabby, disgusting society gone horribly wrong.

They are still cis because transgenderism doesn't exist. However they mutilate their body to appear the opposite sex they will never be what they consider ad trans.

Women can do the same thing. Lesbian porn is the only kind I watch in fact.
Not sure what you're talking about.

I only date trannies now because roasties are impossible to deal with so that's your own fault. If roasties existed who were nice and fun to hang out with like trannies are obviously it'd be better to just settle down with one of them instead. But that's apparently not possible unless you were born male. Hopefully in the future they'll be able to make roasties into decent girlfriend material by replacing their brains with male brains.

Or just make the trannies have more genuine, female bodies.

This is the best i have ever felt in my life. My dick isn't reacting to anything and i feel completely tranquil and at peace. I can finally leave this place. See you later sex needing loser.

It's a good feeling. You can also get it by working really hard on something you're interested in. Women are a distraction

Congrats, you've been chemically castrated by big pharma. At least you seem to enjoy it.

Good goy, now work, buy your taxes and buy things. You don't need a family to be happy nor do you deserve one, just work and consume your pills until you die.

The point is im only attracted to my GF and we have sex at least once a week but i dont have any coomer mentality. No porn and shit, only my GF.

So just a reduced libido.
Maybe women should start partially castrating their bfs while they're asleep. Like just cutting off one testicle.

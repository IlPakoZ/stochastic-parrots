How can you hate women when they're so pretty and sexy?

I spent 2016-2022 misogynistic, now I'm a wamen defender because I see the verbal abuse women endure on /r9k/ and it's just like 'ok this is getting hard to deny.'

Have you ever interacted with them? They behave horribly these days. I don't hate them because I know they aren't inherently bad, but they've been corrupted.
But misogyny isn't just hating them. Kind of like "homophobia", the word is used less precisely these days. Seeing that women are subordinate to men also counts.

I have interacted with women often, but admittedly none who are currently under 20. Maybe zoomer girls are just the worst?

thats the default state of being
youre not becoming anything youre likely just existing without consuming constant propaganda and reverting based on your own observation of fact
women do in fact be shopping

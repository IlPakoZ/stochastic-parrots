my favorite primates by far would be gibbons! though my favorite would be lar gibbons, the only gibbons ive ever been given the opportunity to see are eastern black crested gibbon (native to northern vietnam) when im going to vietnam over the summer and siamangs at the zoo, though i do wish they had bigger enclosures. i would love to go to the san diego zoo one day as it is the most ethical in united states, but i can settle for my local zoo.

I feel the same way about 80s and 90s horror movies and warhammer 40k
the fa/tg/uys are always so mean about everything so I don't like talking to them as it always seems they want to one up each other on warhammer talking points.

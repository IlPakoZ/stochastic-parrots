There's a sick obsession with self-improvement. It's truly cringeworthy. The idea that you have what it takes to succeed, but for whatever reason you just haven't figured it out yet. It's a fallacy. If you had what it takes, your life would have sorted itself out years ago. I'm not telling you to not try to improve your situation, but it's totally delusional to think you can go from 1 to 10 by going to the fucking gym or reading a book. The hand that you were dealt (genetics, what family you were born into) cannot be exchanged. You get what you get, and you can only make the best of it. It's a cope to believe with your recessed maxilla and Asperger's, you can be top 10% by waking up early and taking cold showers. I just wanna grab these people by their shoulders and shake them awake, back to reality. Like bro, you can't win a battle against your own destiny. Take the cards you were dealt and move the fuck on.

yeah some cards are shittier than others, but you can't achieve greatness because of that? Don't get me wrong, if you've got, like, super cancer from the age of 5 then yeah, you've been rekt, but i feel like a lot of people complain about their lives when really it's not that bad. It makes a huge difference if you had good parents or not, but even if your parents were generally shitty you can still rise and overcome. The basic self improvement shit you mentioned is just that: The basics. You won't fix your life by going to the gym and taking cold showers, but oh boy will it help. Personally, I don't much believe in destiny when it comes to people who are able bodied, able minded, and not forced into ridiculous situations outside of their control. Fuck destiny, and fuck you too for acting like a pussy :3

and having mild mental conditions like slight aspergers or anxiety/depression doesn't fucking count as "ridiculous situations outside of their control" that shit's manageable, even if it's shit. I'm talking more like getting drafted into war or something

uber cope. I think it's time for you to get back into the gym. Don't wanna lose those gains, do you?

i think theres tons of merits of such thinking, but for entirely different reasons

its not that its not over, its just that these blind optimistic ideas are great for staying alive. they give you hope, regardless of how delusional

and staying alive right now is very important, because we are so close to the singularity and ai taking over the world

once that happens, it will be a utopia where eveyone can have a perfect body and date a robot gf, or it will be an apocalypse, which is also great, because all of you roasties and normies and pieces of shit human trash deserve to die

so basically, hope and self-improvement is a means to stay alive, because you cant really live being depressed in bed all day

Ahhh it appears that you were under the assumption that I was only talking about getting laid. I was talking about that, but also much more. Getting out of depression, staying productive, maximizing efficiency, probs more too.

why do you have to achieve greatness

even mediocre normalcy would be an amazing achievement for you and make you far happier than you already are

I love chatting with bots but I don't see how a sentence completer is going to lead to AGI, other than stuff DeepMind has shown what else is there to support AGI happening in our lifetimes?

I mean what do you want us to do? Just accept our fate as basement dwelling NEET KHHV or try to take steps to take back some control. Of course you may counter with, "What control? You are destined for a life of misery" Financial control, emotional control and making more control over our social life instead of being tied to the whims of our despair. We want to get out of this desperate situation like a animal backed into a corner we want to fight back. Sure some use all they could to win back control but take years and years to even get to a stage where people in their teenage years already had. It doesn't mean that those years of trying to self-improve are wasted as the other choice is doom and gloom. 

What do I do? I have a binary choice of fight or flight. I want to choose fight even if it's the hardest thing on earth but flight is so easy and a resignation of life and its responsibilities seem so appealing.

its pathetic that being simply content is a seen as cope 
how is some who espouses this philosophy ever happy?

Yeah, it's just cringey. I think humans just have a problem with stepping outside of themselves. People just think they are main characters, and that they can climb to some epic turnaround before the climax. Too many people watched Rocky or Lord of the Rings, so they think they can climb to the top through sheer will and determination.

You can't. You don't have the necessary prerequisites to do it.

the fact that ai is exponentially improving. have you seen gpt4?
remember how bad ai was 10 years ago?

gpt4 can already write code
we have self driving cars that drive better than the majority of the population
ai is making art now. soon some new language model will have the ability to make movies on the spot. ai is already writing english essays on the spot

we are seeing an exponential growth of ai. in 10 years, it will be noticeably smarter than humans. in 15, we will have magical fantastic technology to change into whatever body you want, or we will all be dead because ai killed us

but to be fair, we deserve to die for what we do to animals

i was just being hyperbolic for the sake of exaggerating the point. You COULD reach greatness, and if you could reach greatness, then you could definitely achieve normalcy/happiness.

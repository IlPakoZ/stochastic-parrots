Experiment. 
Robots, you are settled for a whole year in a room where there is a good computer with fast Internet, a bed, a pair of dumbbells. Food will be delivered to you three times a day every day.
Question!
What are you going to do for a whole year in this room? At least you are able to learn any working specialty.

Pace around the room angrily and seethe, basically just what I do now but I don't have to pay for food.

I will only eat one of the three meals daily. Sometimes 2/3. I will become unimaginably swol and post progress updates to 4chan monthly.

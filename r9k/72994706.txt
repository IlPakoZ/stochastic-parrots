Hello. I'd like to understand a few things about trans people. This post is not a bait, it's a genuine want for more information. For reference, I am transphobic, but before forming more concrete opinions I have to understand my opposition better

Why do people transition?
Do they feel more comfortable after it?
Why don't they (often) seek therapy before/after transition?
How do these people view others who transition?
How do they view people who disagree with what they're doing or their ideals?
How do they come to the conclusion of wanting to transition?
Do they come to regret transitioning often, or is this rare?
Do they think that transitioning is an okay thing to do, or do they feel shame for it?
After transitioning, do they change behaviour wide-scale? By this I mean in speech, hygiene, food intake, manners

Please feel free to share your own views, potential information and your own questions. Please do not try to change my view, that is not the purpose. Thank you for your time. Picture unrelated, but I thought it's eye-catching

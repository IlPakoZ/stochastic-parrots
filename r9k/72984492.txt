God living in a city is shit. Every time I walk home from work at night someone either yells out their window threatening shit for zero reason, throw firecrackers at you so you think you're literally being shot, drive onto the curb just to scare you, and much more

No wonder so many people get murdered in cities. One day they'll actually kill me in some gang initiation bs or just for fun. Even the non-confrontational interactions at midnight are scary

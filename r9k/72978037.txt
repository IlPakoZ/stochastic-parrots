Post about your true love ITT.
I'm personally deeply in-love with my cute /r9k/ trans gf. I can't wait to cuddle with her again in a little over a month.
--- 72978087
I-Is this thread a-about me? I love you so much... you make me the happiest girl on r9k! I promise I will be there with you forever!
--- 72978117

I wish you both a slow demise.

Post more meme remakes of nip woodcuttings pls senpai
--- 72978186
I haven't been in love with anyone in like 5 years. I wish I could experience it again, the stages where I actually have a crush on someone and think about them all the time. I legitimately have not met a new woman in RL since I graduated college.
--- 72978246
>>72978087
You're my love forever! &lt;3
>>72978117
We'll be happy and healthy always.
>>72978186
Crush on who? Like a friend or like a random girl in class?
--- 72978270
>I want this retarded birthday card to feel like a yearbook note that makes you scream into your pillow five years in the future. I feel like I only have a few square inches of space to say everything I've been keeping in for years. It would be cruel and irresponsible of me to just dump all of my feelings on you. But you'll be gone soon. Weather you stay in state or not, life will be moving on. I want to believe we're ready to move on. I'm afraid now that maybe you really are. You brought up eternal sunshine of the spotless mind earlier today. Subtle. I feel you. We won't ever be the same bored irresponsible kids with nothing to do during the global pandemic, but maybe some day we could be bored adults?
--- 72978283
>>72978246
Yeah, the last chick I had a crush on was a girl I took an Earth Science class in college with. We worked on projects together, texted every day, she even brought me free food sometimes. We never actually ended up dating but I was head over heels for her. That was years ago though, and I haven't felt that kind of emotion since.

CAN YOU FEEL IT
COMING IN THE AIR TONIGHT?
OH LORD

Thanks to our love r9k is inspired to believe in love again, and love is in the air! I'm so happy that I could have such a positive impact on this board!

Is that a movie quote?
>>72978283
Were you dating or just fwens?
--- 72978482
>>72978460
We never went past friendship, even though we flirted every once in a while. Just wasn't really meant to be. Miss those days where I had a girl paying attention to me in any way at all.
--- 72978509
I love my cute dog Anya. I'm thinking of taking her to the movies with me later.
--- 72978517
How do you desire love again? I am an extremely bitter incel.
--- 72978577
>>72978482
Maybe you can talk to online qt's.

Bad angle for his stupid face.

When did you last love?
--- 72978602
>>72978270
>>72978460
no. I just had no particular person to reply to. My situation is a little complicated I guess. Be careful what you wish for and don't burn bridges is my advice. Relationships are fucking weird and life is too fucking short to put off talking about the uncomfortable shit we keep inside ourselves.

Where does one find online QT's? Asking for a friend. (The friend is me)
--- 72978634
>>72978577
>When did you last love?
Maybe a year ago but I don't know if it was "love". Just got obsessed with some chick to the point of self-harm.
--- 72978669
>>72978622
Yeah it is pretty transparent they are just using this positivity thing as a front to make others feel worse. If they were genuinely happy together they wouldnt be tryharding to be some r9k ecouple. Regardless they are both sociopathic and the gf is the bfs bpd bitchslave and the bf has npd. I cant wait till he discards her.
--- 72978674

I love my box cutter. It makes cute scars :3

convince me love exists. it's just brain chemicals. something people do to socially benefit and i can't see otherwise
--- 72979558
>>72978622
She's my lovey. Everyone should know.
>>72978625
Dating sites after you looksmaxx/take good pics, maybe on 4chan to at least make fwens but trying to date them is very hard.
>>72978634
Are you BPD or what caused that obsession?
>>72978674
I'm glad you have her.
>>72979515
What does love existing mean?
--- 72979573
>>72979558
You're a pretty disgusting person. Something about you just gives me a bad feeling.
--- 72979593
My angel Nyeongie. He is the most perfect man who ever lived.
--- 72979594
>>72979573
I mean he is a sociopath I literally cut for an entire thread and he prioritized harassing people over just not posting and moving on
--- 72979622
>>72979558
I've had zero luck with dating apps my whole life. Most people call me attractive but say I'm too short for them and unmatch me.
--- 72979672
>>72979573
>You're a pretty disgusting person
How?
>>72979622
How short are you? Sounds like you're on tutorial mode desu.
--- 72979696
>>72979672
5'4. People like me when they actually get to know me but on dating apps where the first thing people see is a picture and a listed height, they just swipe left and move on to someone else.
--- 72979713
>>72979672
You just give me a bad feeling. You seem empty and cold.
--- 72979756
>>72979558
>Are you BPD 
No I am not.
>what caused that obsession?
Me meeting someone like her had 1 in billion chance. It felt like fate.
--- 72979809
>>72979696
Literally same, as in 5'4 and attractive face wise. Fuck my parents and God for that one.
--- 72979846
>>72979713
From what do you think that?
>>72979756
Did you date?
>>72979809
Your dating life is still piss easy. Face matters drastically more than height.
--- 72979881
>>72979846
You are constantly cruel to people on this board and pretend to be trying to help others when you are just gathering information to use against them. I would speak more of my mind but I would be temporarily banned again as I have been several times because of you.
--- 72979917
>>72979846
>Did you date? 
No she rejected me.
--- 72979927
>>72979846
wait are you just projecting how easy it is for you onto everyone else? haha
--- 72979933
>>72979917
Are you still friends with her? You should confess a second time. Did you self-harm because of the rejection?
--- 72979948

Why would you lie in such a damn blatant way..????
--- 72979949

I may have had a crush on a girl I worked with. 
I'm not too good at explaining it but she was extremely helpful, such as when she suspected that she had a broken finger and still guided my hands when it came to cutting up plastic liners because I'm atrocious with scissors.
She would also come by and help in the warehouse when she had time and I had to do a task. She made something easy for a baking thing based on my diet and she only had nice things to say about me. 
I tried to be as helpful as possible and I did catch her looking at me during a daily meeting.
Looking at my training file or back far enough in certain books is unpleasant because I see her initials and i think of her again, she left the job 6 months ago.
There was one glass bottle still with her signature out until 2 weeks ago when we had to wash it for use in preparing something new.
--- 72980517
>Manuelitaaaa! Come and give your abuela a kiss!
>M-manny? Why are you dressed like a girl...
--- 72980707
You two have singlehandedly made me hate trans people as much as I do women. congrats. Absolute filth.
--- 72980726
>>72980707
Why do you hate Retard-san? She's trans, OP is just a normal male.
--- 72980771
>>72980707
Trans people are literally worse than every single woman out there which is very telling
--- 72980786
>>72980771
I have come to the same conclusion. and it is not because I have some moral objection to them being trans, they are genuinely shitty and selfish people.
>>72980726
I hate them both because she enables his behavior and rubs her good fortune in the faces of people who cannot even achieve what they have under a fake mask of trying to give them hope.
--- 72980918
>>72980517
Another great fanfic. My gf is not out to her grandparents so she will be boymoding while we are staying with them.

Their level of narcissism is also incredibly off the charts
--- 72980947
>>72980926
Be careful before you get doxxed. You realize that r9k and Kiwi Farms have a high amount of overlap, right? You should stop posting before some nutter turns you into a lolcow.
--- 72980971
>>72980926
? How is it deranged? 

>>72941634 
>>72980918

You aren't out to your grandma, right? So she would still call you by your 'deadname', right?
--- 72980992
>>72980971
that fake spaniard would never dare refer to trannykuns gf as a male otherwise he would immediately call her out. i hope he makes it clear to her that she had no problem having grandchildren so she is a larping normalfag too

As much as I pathetically yearn for a GF, I don't think I've ever actually fallen in love with somebody. The cloests I've gotten were just a few infatuations with some attractive women I hardly knew. The little I did know told me that they wouldn't have liked me anyway, so I'd just occasionally fantasize about them with completely different personalities.

when you got together with your bf, did you realize that you were never actually lonely before? like did it sink in that you didnt actually suffer loneliness like men do? or do you still believe you were ever lonely?

I hate you with every fiber in my body. You make a lot of people here really fucking sad with your display of love. I do not hate couples in fact I'm happy if people find love. But going on r9k where people that are outcast are and showing off is fucking sick. You help people you make them even more miserable and you know it
--- 72981346

--- 72981355
>>72981272
You're replying to a tranny not a woman
--- 72981359
>>72981334
I agree with this they are pretty transparent about their real intentions if you pay much attention. The bf is obviously a narcissist who gets off on harassing people and they have even said he gets the gf to post here. 
>>72980992
I can imagine him saying those same retarded canned lines to the grandmother
>actually your grandchild is a cute girl not a boy
--- 72981379
>>72981355
She is a qt girl dough. "Bio girl" isn't a real concept. It isn't like scientific at all. It's a misuse of the words. She is trans, though.
--- 72981386
>>72981379
the way you talk is so disgusting. You act just like someone else I knew who browses here. At least they were nice at times though you just seem to be a piece of shit.

Please stop deadnaming Retard san. All she has done is try to post hopefuel for other trubots like her. She was able to find her soul mate on r9k, so she wants to help make sure none of you give up trying. You can find love like she did.
--- 72981476
>>72981359
I can see him saying those canned lines too. Although apparently he's your average doormat in person, or "shy" as retard-san puts it. So maybe he'll keep his bitch boy mouth shut. What else can you expect from someone who lives online?
--- 72981483
>>72981471
>trubots 
they are both normalfags. She found someone to abuse her and obsess over because she is bpd. Look at the bfs responses he is incredibly condescending and insulting whenever he responds to people, they dont care about giving people hope they are just trying to bother those less fortunate.
--- 72981497
>>72981476
He sure posts a lot. I see him here constantly. 
>shy irl 
many cases. Probably is a bitch irl and takes out his frustrations at random incels online, sociopath like most normalfags.
--- 72981502
>>72981483
This. They both brought a robot to cut himself by harassing him for months and continued to do after they found out. They're normalfags who don't really care or even truly understand.
--- 72981513
In the name of love, stop it! I met my boyfriend on this board last novemeber. We were both lonely khhv and now we have each other. Our love is pure, wholesome, and beautiful. I am his girlfriend and we are going to be together forever.
I just wanted to inspire people to attain love like me, I found love on this board so I want to give hopefuel to everyone here so you can believe in love too.

If they're in a relationship together neither were ever really robots

>>72981513
This is such transparent bullshit. This would *maybe* be believable if this was your first thread and you weren't aware yet of the results, but every thread you make erupts into chaos and you still try to act as though you're innocent and well-intentioned? Fuck off. You enjoy upsetting people, you enjoy stirring the pot, and you enjoy laughing with your boyfriend on Discord about each and every time you cause a disruption and get under people's skin.

--- 72981758
>>72981669
Tranny-kun's logic unit has some interesting quirks when you take a look inside.

Anyone
>I was lonely before I met my partner
Tranny-kun
>you had no difficulty finding love therefore you are nowhere near a robot or an incel, you are a LARPing normalfag

Woman
>I feel lonely
Tranny-kun
>it is impossible for a woman to experience loneliness unless she is disabled or disfigured

Tranny-kun's girlfriend (who has a penis and testicles)
>I am a cute girl who was a lonely robot for a long time before I met my boyfriend

>You are absolutely a real female robot who experienced loneliness before we met in one of your boyfriend seeking threads

>>72981751
Who invited the pedophile? Go away
--- 72981774

Yeah it is obviously on purpose. I wonder what other things I could do and they would still laugh at. Cutting myself did not work.
--- 72981791
>>72981748
>I have talked to over 900 people in the past year and a half and not a single one liked me
That's a lie but even if it was true, I could understand why nobody enjoys speaking to a melancholy molly.
--- 72981803
>>72981758
They are clearly narcissistic, npd people claim to be very logical despite basing their decisions primarily on emotions, from what I have noticed. You forgot.
Anyone:
>I have looked a long time and cannot find a partner
Tranny-kun:
>you havent looksmaxxed and talked to women you are not really trying

Damn. Remember when he thought it was all one person? LMAO. Anyway, I hate tranny-kun because he essentially killed the cool interests gf manifestation anon's threads. It's a ghost town in there now. Also he's an insufferable normalfaggot with little to no compassion. Glad others noticed this as wall.

how did he kill their threads? Yeah he went into any of mine and just started harassing me. No empathy.
--- 72981924
>>72980971
So did we get an answer to this? Do her grandparents misgender her? Do they respect her pronouns? If not, I really think Tranny Kun is well within his rights to highlight their transphobia and correct them, just like he does with the normalfaggots on this board.
--- 72981937
>>72981924
They are both normalfags.
--- 72981945
>>72981809
I love you! &lt;3
>>72981882
The manifester anon threads basically had the mio poster talking to him and a few other anons following his stuff with some girl until she rejected him. He literally has nothing going on until day ~200. I highly doubt it was me who killed it. If you replied to me to make the thread about how much you hate me, that's not my fault.
>>72981937
He's obviously trolling.
--- 72981950
>>72981903
Whoa! Calm down there, BPD girl! I do like, though, how you have zero emotion over people feeling hurt by your threads, but become disheveled if someone even lightly criticizes you.
--- 72981976
>>72981937
Boy, you're really camped out in here huh. Maybe you should get some hobbies besides being a sourfaced susan. Also, if you don't know how the filters work, I can show you. But you need to promise not to shit up qt girl threads in future.
--- 72981979
>>72981945
You are a normalfag. You are sociopathic just like them.
>>72981950
that is funny. I could have maimed myself physically as bad as I wanted and they wouldnt have cared but if you say they started hrt during the wrong year they sperg. hahahaha.

I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to trigger you with my comment. My understanding is that using HRT after puberty is likely to lead to kekworthy results.

What are you talking about? I'm agreeing with you that misgendering someone is disrespectful. Arguably worse than just pretending to be lonely online.

No because it is the fact your bf harassed me for months and made me cry multiple times just for shits and giggles and now he has a gf with minimal effort and I was and continue to be alone.

even if I filtered her the point stands they are rubbing their success in the faces of those that cannot get what they have. she only looked for a fucking month and tries to claim she was actually a robot and lonely while her bf harasses people constantly in threads about not actually being lonely or calling them normalfags.

Long story short of it is that the OP from those threads made a gf manifesting thread and people would post in there essentially doing the same and wishing the OP luck on his journey and rooting for him. The guy is pretty young so how can you not wish him the best? The threads were comfy and everyone got along alright for the most part, which is rare for r9k. Newfag tranny-kun finds the thread and dedicates every day to not only harassing the OP from there but most of the other posters there too. Tranny-kun was always looking for arguments or ways to put people down. Naturally, it brought moral down and people slowly left the thread. Now it's a shell of its former self. Sad to see it happen.
>>72981945
Your negativity and constant need to put the OP from there down killed it. You scared everyone away or put them off.
>If you replied to me to make the thread about how much you hate me, that's not my fault.
This didn't happen until the "end", once the damage was already done. You came into the threads daily jus to argue with people.

--- 72982554
>>72982340
Is that so? That's too bad, I can understand the frustration you must be feeling. I hope you cheer up my man even if our one place for venting is being taken away. Tranny-kun has no compassion for others. He also can't admit to his faults, there's no helping him. He has a big ego and too much self importance. He even went as far as claiming that everyone in the manifestation thread was one person who was schizo and followed him thread to thread to hate on him. Like? How narcissistic can you get? He couldn't comprehend multiple people not liking him. Best way to irritate him is by ignoring him all together.
--- 72982574

I mean, I dont think it is possible for you to do so no. You obviously dont care about others and just want an excuse to be cruel and invalidate the experiences of those you know are less fortunate than you. For example you spent months calling me a normalfag and not listening when I tried to explain myself, now you call me severely mentally ill.
>>72982554
>your one place for venting being taken 
Yes, further, this is the only place I have human interaction in. And they took it away by constantly harassing me. But they have friends and a gf this whole time. It pisses me off so much. 
>cant admit to his faults
yes I am pretty sure he has npd and his gf has bpd. 
>ignore him
then he will just keep harassing people.
Why does someone like that get to have a partner and be happy when I dont when I have never done things like that? Even if I was mean to people I dont follow them through threads and harass them except in this one case as retaliation. What makes him so much better than me?

From my perspective you're an extremely mentally ill person (you agree with this) who is holding themselves and potentially other people hostage over me gatekeeping normalfags.

I was rejected by my crush yesterday, but I'm already used to rejection by now. Despite having an ex bf and claiming before numerous times to want a bf, she instead claimed that she likes women more and wants a gf and how it's rare to find the right bf because of her "weird tastes" in guys.
Like her I'm a late 20s shut-in stuck living with my family (who I don't have the greatest relationships with) and no car, but at least I have a stable job (approaching six digits) and have a 20% house down payment on standby. Meanwhile, she wants to become a Twitch Partner but doesn't put in the effort to consistently stream, produce videos, etc. to make streaming/content creation a full-time job (or even a part-time job for that matter). I hope she finds some guy that sympathizes/empathizes with her that she agrees to date because I have high doubts that a female partner is willing to lower her standards for what are basically the stereotypical red flags for guys.

I haven't met a girl worth crushing over in years...

Getting old just sucks: all the women in your age range are bitter old whores who think they are worth their weight in gold, and you feel like a pervert everytime you interact with a 19yo and actually remember what innocence and positivity feels like.
If there's any kids reading this shit: fix your life now, you don't know how hopeless life get's after 25. Don't screw your youth, it's where you are supposed to start building your life (everything taste like ash if you miss that vital stage).

NTA but have you tried finding a bf on r9gay
--- 72992405
>>72992335
not the guy you responded to, but have always been an asshole, so here's how i act,when I'm not putting up a facade:
only interact with other people if you are bored and completely ignore them when you're not.
if any of your friends has a gf that noone likes, be the one to say that to her face when your friends are around. By being the asshole,who says what everyone is thinking, people will let you get away with being the asshole just for the sake of it.
if you're at a party and can't leave for some reason, just get wasted and make it everyone else's problem.

>>72992345
ffs. I'm not bragging
I. WANT. MY. NORMIE. FRIENDS. TO. NOT. FORCE. ME. TO. GET. A. RELATIONSHIP.
i get it, it's the opposite of the problem people here usually have. Doesn't mean i enjoy it. If we could switch roles, trust me, I'd do it in a heartbeat
--- 72992426

I have not, I want someone with no online friends just like me. Nobody really shows interest in me except to attack me (like the bf of this thread did for months).

You are not suicidally lonely nor have you ever been truly isolated, I imagine you have always had at least online friends.

so you recognize there's a possiblity of you being one atleast, that's good. You dont need positive reinforcement as long as you get any kind of attention it will satisfy ur narcissistic urges. You enjoy seeing other anons jealous, and I mean it's fine I'd enjoy it too, but dont be a hypocrite about it atleast.

Antagonistic Narcissism
Antagonistic narcissism is defined by a sense of competitiveness, arrogance, and rivalry. While all people with narcissistic traits can be overly concerned with how they appear to others, antagonistic narcissists are particularly concerned with coming out "on top."
Someone with antagonistic narcissism may try to exploit others to get ahead. They may put others down or start arguments in an attempt to gain the upper hand or appear dominant.

Narcissists desire admiration in some way. They're not just attention whores.
Also it's not about making people envious. I made this thread since my gf wanted me to make a cute thread. If I wanted to make people envious I'd go to a thread where people are talking about

I respect the work Tranny Kun does on behalf of all robots. Even though he never claims to be one of us, he defends our identity tirelessly against normalfag invaders. Even though none of us thank him for his efforts, he will stand alone against dozens of larping normies, defeating their arguments one by one. It's sad that so many incels here are so blinded by their misogyny and jealousy that they would rather insult and deadname a girl trying to bring positivity on the board than thank her boyfriend for protecting our community.

No. This board is like 95+% normalfags. If you don't like normalfag threads, they're very easy to filter/hide and then you'll only have a few spam threads left over.

The main thing is unreasonably high sense of their own importance. The nit picking of words will prob not change most people minds tho you will prob think for your gf on this one. Research mental illness is not like coding. People are different. If think your not you can always get test.

If this thread brings you significant pain/emotional turmoil, then 4chan probably isn't for you. You can incredibly easily hide it if you want to and filter ones like it. Normalfags incessantly insisting they're incels/robots is something that needs to be fought directly and are a poison to threads, while just normalfag threads can be easily hidden. Also defending incels/robots from braindead normalfag arguments needs to be done directly.

that's not the point that i'm trying to make here, what i'm asking is what is your endgame with this incessant bragging, not once did you deny that these threads were bragging, so tell us, my dear tranny-kun, what do you get from bragging except a small relief to your narcissistic urges
--- 72993195
>>72993101
Ignoring/hiding my posts/threads would help you. If you wanted to be friends with me maybe we could talk about your experiences with therapy in some level of detail and how maybe you could go back and get some help from better therapists. I'm not a psychologist and your mental illness seems to be the problem here from what you've said.
>>72993154
>you acknowledge they can feel a little bad about themselves right?
People feeling somewhat bad about themselves is the nature of 4chan where people are extremely harsh. If you can't stand that little bit of bad, then learn to use filters.

Therapists often don't have the same experiences or trauma as their patients but they're trained to manage it and help treat the issues anyhow. Is it not possible to get the free therapy again?
--- 72993655
>>72992816
>Why not just stop talking to them?
cause they won't let me ghost them

i just want them to leave me alone,before i hurt them even more
--- 72993666
>>72993616
>they are trained to treat the issues
I dont think they are trained to treat mine. 99% of it was just me freeform talking and even when I pushed for actionable steps to take they barely offered anything. Further, they told me my goal for life was harmful and they hoped I did not achieve it. Also they asked me multiple times
>why are you here?
--- 72993728
>>72993655
You should probably talk to them about helping you keep yourself in check to not be an asshole. It depends on how your assholeishness comes out, really, and it can probably be changed. Being suicidally lonely is undoubtedly worse than that.
>>72993666
>they told me my goal for life was harmful and they hoped I did not achieve it
What did you say your goal in life was?
>they asked me multiple times
>>why are you here?
What did you tell them? What did you say before they asked that or was it just random seemingly? Both of these things seem like bad practices, but not all therapists will act this way.
--- 72993795
>>72993728
I told them my life goal was to be turned into what someone wanted or turn someone into what I wanted.
>what did you tell them
I do not recall.
--- 72993891
>>72993795
I still think seeing new therapists could be helpful, especially if they know you BPD and they're focusing on treating that.
I have random ideas on how you could gather new options, e.g. posting your pics and talking about how you want a bf who's also completely lonely and has no friends (even online) like you. But I don't think they're particularly great ideas. Just trying more to see if you can find someone who likes/loves you is what you have to do if you want to find love.
--- 72993911
>>72993891
>have bpd
I am not diagnosed with bpd I have been told I am just faking. I am too ugly to post pictures and when I would try to post looking for people with no friends you would harass me and others would harass me also nobody has no friends and wants to interact with me. Everyone who says they dont have anyone to interact with later admits they were lying.
--- 72993974
>>72993911
>I have been told I am just faking
I'm obviously not 100% sure if you're BPD, but you could get screened for it to get a diagnosis if it's there. It could be some other mental issue or a set of mental issues, which would be good to know too.
There are self-help books for BPD and a lot of /lgbt/ anons deal with it, too, so if you think you have it, then there are non-therapy potential things to do and you could ask other boards for general/specific advice.
>you would harass me
If I knew it was you, I wouldn't respond to you like that anymore. Also, even if your face is ugly (I don't actually know if it is), posting pics of your skinny estrogenized body is appealing to certain people and will lure them in.
If you think there are no people with no friends (even online), or they're just super rare, then can you accept them just having online friends?
--- 72994087
>>72993974
I cannot afford that screening.
>self help bpd things
I have trouble being consistent with anything because of my emotional episodes.
>skinny
I am not skinny, I have horrible teeth, and I am balding. I am horrifically ugly.
>accept them having online friends
no because they will always prioritize them and the relationship will be incredibly one sided. Also I have intense jealousy issues. Also I want to be understood and someone that can readily make online friends would not understand.
--- 72994138
I am so happy to see a thread about love. I do not often get the chance to preach about the highest form of love one can experience. 

Since I devoted my life to the worship of our Queen, Saint Iris, I have been filled with a love beyond compare. My autism has been entirely cleansed in her Holy Light. 

I urge all of you to join me in offering her the praise that is rightfully hers as reigning Queen of r9k.
--- 72994180
>>72994087
>I have trouble being consistent with anything
What do you mean?
Also how do you get money for HRT? Are you able to do any kind of work?
Are you not able to become skinny with effort? Anything wrong with your face doesn't need to be a huge deal if you work on having a decent body, or a body that's decent enough to guys with that taste.
>the relationship will be incredibly one sided
How do you know they'll not prioritize you? People can understand you without being in your current predicament, also.
--- 72994631

You are just going to tell me things are easy again now I assume.
>how do you know they will not prioritize you
experience and I refuse to compete with others because I know I will lose.

not by my definition of understanding. I need them to have felt it themselves not just claim to know what it feels like.

Either you have to find completely friendless anons, perhaps you could make threads/a general talking about your friendless life and other anons can do the same, on here and /lgbt/. Or you can just be the number one priority for some anons with 1-a few online friends, which I think should be possible if they actually want someone to love and care for them.
People could be friendless in the past like during their schooling without being friendless now, also.
--- 72995778
>>72995737
I have tried that and you harassed me in them, if I recall. Also lgbt is full of people pretending to be friendless. 
>number one priority
I am not and have never been anyones priority, I refuse to associate with those with friends for that reason. 
>friendless in the past 
they lie about things like that constantly.
--- 72995889
>>72995778
If you make them here I won't reply to you in that way.
If you can't find anyone who's friendless, then I think it makes sense that you'd try with those who were friendless in the past and that you become their priority after you gain interest in each other. And you have to find one who's not lying about it.
--- 72995960
>>72995889
Wow thanks it only took months and multiple threads of me cutting myself.
>friendless in the past 
When I say I was isolated I mean completely locked in an enclosed area for months at a time alone. Normalfags call being friendless just not liking or connecting with their friends. I have never connected with anyone in a meaningful way. 
>gain interest in each other
Nobody has been interested in me out of 900 people.
>find one who is not lying about it
They dont just say they are lying about it. And further, if they have friends now they are too distinct from me for me to meaningfully connect to them. Even them wanting friends is indicative of normalized social values and a level of socialization that alienates me from them considerably.
--- 72996114
>>72995960
Well if you absolutely need them to be completely friendless, then you need to seek them out particularly since those people are hard to find.

You make assumptions too quickly on anons, the fact that you've done what you do in so many threads demonstrates this well. You never know what an anon's situation truly is and taking an antagonistic approach doesn't help hardly any of them. Normal people will come and go, the truly downtrodden stay. There's no need to police that

Do you really think I care about being antagnostic on 4chan? Especially when they're LARPing normalfags.
>the truly downtrodden stay
Absolutely not. This board is like 95+% normalfags.
>There's no need to police that
Come up with some solid reasons why gatekeeping normalfags is bad, and I might agree.

You dont care about hurting me that is apparent, I guess you are genetically superior to me because you are white

Yes, because you suddenly did care when some guy started following you around threatening to slit his wrists.
--- 72997055
>>72997051
correction he still did not care

I hope the guy I just blocked posts about me here pls

I don't want you to hurt, and luck on genes is just about what differentiates robots from normalfags in general, i.e. looks, predispositions towards mental illness, etc. 
>>72997051
I don't really care about being antagonistic to almost all 4chan posters. If someone is extremely vulnerable, though, and I realize this, I will try to stop with them.

Lol what

It is because you are white you can just be honest about it

I didn't/don't know your race. I'm not a racist. I was an infamous avatarfag on /qa/ for being too progressive and having countless arguments there defending tranners and whatnot.

crushing after this cute trans girl who works at the Dutch Bros by my house
we follow each other on Instagram and have liked each other's stories a couple times, I'm just horribly scared of making a move and on top of that I've never been with a trans girl

How romantic.

Okay, but you see why it's pointless to throw hands at everybody and then find out they're extremely mentally ill / you were wrong about them later?
--- 72997240
>>72997213
You're implying I'm always wrong when I'm actually extremely rarely wrong about labeling them normalfags. Apart from misreading/misunderstooding a post's words, I think I've only been wrong a few times total.
--- 72997255
>>72997213
they have npd they wont admit they are wrong unless extreme methods are used and usely not even then 
>>72997240
since you harassed me for months can you attempt to give me some non reddit tier advice please
--- 72997272

You don't know that because we're all anonymous, and it still doesn't justify showing zero empathy for other people .Tsk tsk

I don't have experience with BPD. Talk to people with it and ask them. I'm not a god, but I saw in your thread there's a guy who fits your ideal which is far more than most could ever ask for right off the bat.
>>72997272
Being sociopathic is when you call people normalfags now?

oh it must be easy for me huh

It's actually narcissistic

By what definition of narcissism is calling normalfags out narcissistic?

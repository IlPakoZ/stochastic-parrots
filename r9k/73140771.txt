how horrible anon truly from the bottom of my heart I feel your pain. people would tell you to hit the gym some might even say get a lawyer and sue your ex using common law marriage like xqc and adept. but i say NAH. you should get a wow sub and join my guild of twink to gank people to vent our anger. we can especially target those with your exes initials

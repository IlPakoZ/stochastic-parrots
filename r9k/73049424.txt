I think the person would just reject my money but I could try. He pretty much neves leaves his house but I wanna help him have friends in real life. What places could I invite him to go?

if he never leave his house this is difficult as I never leave my house, it is too comfy in here and the outside world is a mess and full of chaos

First send letters and try and get a reply, find out what that person likes and dislikes, then you can build on getting them to go outside.

Literally anywhere 
The movies, hiking, the lake, parks, bowling, dinner, breakfast, lunch, places that matter to you, book clubs, stores, bars, concerts, rodeo, amusement parks, farms, races, home, work, etc.

How can I send him letters if he does not give me his house adress? Or you meant virtual ones
>>73049675
I asked him if he wanted to go to the cinema with me and he said he has to do an eye surgery or something. Maybe I could try to get him to visit a store with me at night because people that dont like leave house prefer leaving at night right?

Also before my job went perma-remote in 2020 I used to get the starbucks frappuccino bottles from the vending machine at my office sometimes.

i don't drink starcucks
i only drink black coffee with grounds that i made myself
but i only drink coffee like once or twice a month if even that. i hate the taste of coffee and covering it with sugar doesn't help.\

Given the option, hell yeah.
Why don't I give you my own recipe?

1 Vanilla Bean Frappe, Venti
1 pump of Whip Cream at the bottom, plenty on top
2 servings of Dragonfruit on the bottom, 1 for the whipped topping
4 pumps of Raspberry Syrup.

On a very bad day, I drank this in a ghetto neighborhood asking for suicide. They went "damn, that looks bussin".
Make of that what you will.

It's a drink. do people really care?
--- 73041145
>>73041000
It's actually really important because drinking a frappucino as a man is a symbol of weakness and femininity. It's furthering the downfall of America and decaying masculinity.

I just drink black hazelnut coffee.
--- 73041163
>>73041145

Blacks love those fruity drinks. A black guy at the restaurant I worked at made a strawberry shortcake once, all these grilled out thugs who worked in the kitchen were losing their minds over it.
--- 73042052

--- 73042057

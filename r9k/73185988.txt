what sucks is that even if found a girlfriend, there's like a 25% chance that she'll like and entertain the fact I have a foot fetish.

what are you talking about, broski? a foot fetish is one of the less weird fetishes. theres a 99% chance shes gonna love jerking her man with her pretty little feet. you got this. stop being a sperg and put yourself out there.

nah mate, they can merely tolerate for sure, but to be okay and actively like it is a whole other ballpark that only some women can handle

hmm. well, im just thinking about it in terms of what the woman would need to do to satisfy the fetish. it's not like a cuckold or voyeurism fetish where she needs to do really risk stuff. with a foot fetish all she has to do is understand that her man really gets off on her feet and maybe put on a sexy show here and there, and i think most women would do that for a man they care about.

fetishists in general are cringe, especially when it's something already normalized

it's like they're jerking off to a piece of paper with their fetish written on it while ignoring you

i no longer waste time with fetishists/coomers

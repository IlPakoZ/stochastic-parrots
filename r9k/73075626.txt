An entrepreneur came up with the idea of a physical advertisement of your romantic status. 

What is the consensus?

>Comments on social media accounts have pointed out the possibilities of how women who wear the ring might be solicited more often.

We all knew what would happen. Why would a girl want to signal her availability to unattractive men, anyway?

kinda hard to see a ring on someone's finger, maybe they should make it like a band of cloth somewhere on your clothes, maybe like on your shirt sleeve
--- 73075649
if I was single I'd honestly join in.
To either kms for being proven as worthless or experience being approached for once in my life. I will never get that life affirming experience of being wanted and can never recover.
--- 73075655
Given that the primary impediment to people wanting to try and court someone they think is cute is worrying that it'll be unwelcome, a little visual indicator saying "I'm open to you at least trying" isn't a terrible idea

Dumb idea unless they make the gimmick that they can turn it red most of the time and switch to green when they're near a Chad.

They'll just keep it off until they see someone they want to approach them.

And that's a good thing. More women suffering like men is what the world needs thanks for taking part and making sure the dating market remains as is.

Gtfo w this shilling of your garbage, and focus your efforts on Reddit
Claddagh rings have existed for centuries and aren't made from nasty chink plastic

>>73075655
it doesn't solve the problem at all, actually
it's welcome from attractive people, whether you're taken or not, it's invariably unwelcome from unattractive people. a ring doesn't indicate if you, as a potential suitor, are unattractive.
--- 73075840
>>73075818
It's also entirely pointless for men.
--- 73075848
This just seems like an open invention for the undesirables (people like the people on here) to approach me and then harass me when I say no. Yea ill pass!
--- 73075919
This is the dumbest idea. It doesn't do anything to solve the shortcomings of dating apps. It's basically the same thing but on extreme difficulty, turbo mode.
There's no easy way around the problem of having to get to know people.

Fully half the problem with the awkwardness of courting in general is the need to be excessively defensive to keep away creeps who can't or won't take the hint, but which intimidates everyone else. I can think of two contrasting experiences between
>a) Somebody nice and socially intelligent who I had sex with once, propositioned me again in an indirect way, and when I indirectly declined they instantly got the message and didn't ask again
and
>b) Somebody who I wasn't at all interested in but was just nice to in a normal way, and then kept trying over and over and over until I had to just block them and dead them
The minority of people like b) ruin it for the majority of people like a)

It's amazing we condition generations after Gen X to never get good socializing skills and as such be crippled to a point they have no skills or understanding on how to build a social network, worse, they were never warned that as you get older networking gets harder and harder as the pool of sane, healthy people that make good friends and lovers are all already taken.

the problem is that zoomers are too autistic to communicate. 
1. if you're at a bar or social event you're already signaling that you're trying to meet people. 99% of the time, it doesn't matter if you are single or in a relationship, people vibe all the time (except autistic sexless losers who spent their youth at home)
2. if you're relying on a ring to help you break the ice, you might as well do something less desperate, like smoking cigarettes, getting a tattoo, or dressing nice. with this thing on, while you also stand awkwardly in the corner, you will look like a pedophile and everyone will hate you.

Maybe a device that only signals you are single to Chad and taken to everyone else would be a much better business opportunity.

>>73076011
yep. i'm already covered in stuff that gives people an excuse to talk to me, and it works when i actually go places. i would not wear this ring of thirst.
--- 73076050
>>73076021
Chad wouldn't sign up for it, because we're also picky.
--- 73076089
>>73075967
That's how the world works these days. Efficiency above all else; character and personality mean jack shit. Soon the entire world will function like an anonymous imageboard, quick little interactions with total nobodies.
--- 73076165
I appreciate them actually trying to come up with solutions but there's no chance women will let dating get any easier for uglies
--- 73076194

I never mentioned Chad should sign-up for anything.

Jesus christ.. why not just make a shirt that says you're single right on the front and back.
--- 73076303

maybe if your goal is to attract children nonce
--- 73076304
The only reason this is a thing is because women refuse to grow up and a lot of them insist on doing shit like going out to bars or clubs while they are in relationships. Maybe if these whores would just be loyal I wouldn't have to worry if they're single.

a store chain in my country tried differently colored baskets for single people. it ended up being a flop.

It also will put you in a worse situation, Chad doesn't need to wear the ring or be single to get hit on. Girls will just make fun of you for and feel "unconfortable" that a non chad dude wants and is open to date.
They will try to take it as if you are saying that you want to raw dog them to try to sic other dudes on you. Remember that men that are not wanted are pretty much sinning for having desires which doesn't apply to them.

This is a genius idea given the circumstances. It might backfire though since it will make irl like online where even average girls are flooded with men simping for their attention.
--- 73076957
A man wearing that ring will make women think you are pathetic. If you want better luck with women pretend to be taken and wear a wedding ring.
--- 73077421
>>73075927
A lot of the time the problem is with (You), a femoid, stringing them along and using them as simps without making it 100% concrete you will NEVER be interested. Fuck off with the "Take the hint" shit. 
Just say NO. 
You have a mouth. It's for making words. Not just for sucking chad dick.

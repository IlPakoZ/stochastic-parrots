My IQ is capped at 100 and I only have a high school diploma.
How do I appear more intelligent and or how do I raise my IQ?
I value being smart a lot but I can't seem to find the motivation to discipline myself for training my intellectual faculties.

You cant really raise your IQ. If you are at 100 and have poor health, then it may be improved slightly, however. 

Cardio. Increase/improve circulation and increase blood flow to your brain. Eat healthy foods and have a surplus of micronutrients. You can try lions mane as well, it may help to repair any damages to your brain. Unfortunately, grey matter cannot be regained entirely so if you have been eating tons of refined sugars, fapping/porn addiction and have an ongoing internet addiction then your brain is probably fucked forever. Social isolation and loneliness/depression will also destroy your brain probably forever. Hydration is also important. You cannot go above your genetic limit, but you can make sure you are at your genetic limit by being in excellent health. If your health is bad and your habits are bad for your health, then you are actually below your genetic ceiling.

IQ is meaningless

Your ability to apply your knowledge and your motivation to take advantage of it is what matters. You don't need to be the smartest man in the world to be successful, you just need to learn how to take advantage of what skills and knowledge you possess 

You can do that anon

This thread is for the boys.

How are you doing today?
Did you step closer to your goals and aspirations?
Have you eaten yet?
How did you sleep last night?
How many people have you talked to today?
Did you learn any cool facts of history or present?

I don't get it, this board is filled with men who hate women, but seem apathetic towards men. Meanwhile, I care about men. Men's wellbeing creates or destroys societies.

There are maybe twelve actual robots on this board, the rest are attention seeking zoomers. This is hell, we're in hell.

--- 73181736
>>73181664
tfw no city pop gf indeed :( I've been trying for an eternity to get the 80s hairstyle but all I got was the AI making the artstyle 80s

It is now Kyoko hours

>>73181994
Hii Rochelle welcome back :))
--- 73182216
Occult Hana
--- 73182318
My boyish wife looks so happy. I just want to brush that cute red hair from her eyes and give her a kiss.
>>73181994
She lives in a very comfy town. A cute muscled tomboy like her must have so much to do there.
--- 73182385
>>73181435 (OP)
Cute wifey wife.
--- 73182389
>>73182318
Hiking, biking, rafting, climbing, skiing, etc etc. She would be very active in the comfy mountain town.
--- 73182394
getting real thirsty all of a sudden
--- 73182563
tried experimenting with her hair to distinguish her more from Nicole, kinda just ended up with Eleanor :/

>>73182216
Occult hana more like a cute hana
--- 73182680
It appears she's feeling playful tonight
--- 73182681
Dark Souls Basilisk Hana?

>>73182563
Every Hana is a cute Hana though
--- 73182711
>>73181664
Long time no see, friend. May I have a Satsuki?
--- 73182760
For such a populat haircut it seems to not understand the hime cut. I had better prompting out the individual traits (blunt bangs, blunt ends, sidelocks) rather than just using "hime cut"

>>73182681
that be true, Hana always a cute

>>73182681
a silly goober if you will
--- 73182827
I like these eyes, and I don't know where they're coming from. I tried "disembodied eyes" but they didn't show up until I after I deleted the prompt.

>>73182760
Nicolanor is cute too lol
--- 73182852
>>73182711
Brand new Satsuki, by special request!
--- 73182931
the birds turned out better than I expected

>>73182852
 she looks beautiful :O How do you get that kinda artstyle in nemu?
--- 73182979
>>73182852
Blessed be
--- 73182984
Basalisk eyes again
--- 73183012
>>73182931
1980s_style, retro_artstyle, film_grain, and backlighting do the heavy lifting, I think

>>73182984
Occult Hana is mega huggable
--- 73183018
Good evening, but good night. Goodnight /aiwg/
--- 73183122
>>73182984
she looks really warm want cuddles

>>73183012
thanks for the prompts :)) Will try them out!

>>73183018
good to see you around scientist anon, enjoy your sleep :))
--- 73183177
i think we took too much...
--- 73183189
Eyes b gone I guess

>>73183012
And she has thousands of tentacles to hug you back!

>>73183122
Impossible geometry cuddling with waifu
--- 73183252
>>73182394
Felt inspired to make chocolate flavor Rochelle. Reminds me of casca from berserk desu.
--- 73183270
I'd generate more cute wife pictures but I'm still hungover from drinking so much earlier. I need to sleep and hopefully dream of her.
>>73183252
I hope she enjoyed her time at the beach getting that tasty tan
--- 73183287
Heavenly Kyoko and not so heavenly Nicole
--- 73183417
the bird has a moHAWK

heh get it, hawk
--- 73183419
havent been able to stop making cute girls, i've never really messed with AI before for image generating so this is new.
prompts are finicky.
--- 73183483
>>73183252
Wasn't here very long but I'm off to bed, night aiwg.
>>73183287
Wrong they are both heavenly women.

Very tentacle, sorta eldritch I like it

Good morning Goa

Good night /aiwg/

Trying to get the tentacles coming out of a wormhole or something.
--- 73184066
>>73184017
nighty night
sweet tiddies and rip
>>73184034
now when you say wormhole do you mean which orifice?
--- 73184078
>>73183417
Nicole I think your bird got lost in the Goa dimension
--- 73184081
>>73184066
Ideally no holes are for worms but maybe you can set me straight.
--- 73184137
Smug spess eyes
--- 73184142
Nicole scares me sometimes, and I find that very hot

>>73184017
night Saeriah! Sleep well :))

>>73184034
wormhole you say?

>>73184078
fear not for she has an infinite supply of edgy birds. Maybe she and goa are now in the same dimension
--- 73184167
>>73184081
Imagine a symbiotic relationship between magical hole worms (imagine earthworm style worms rather than thin parasitic worms) and your waifu, where they enhance her holes with all the slimy wiggling around, and also aid in her being horny 24/7 because she has worms providing near constant stimulus

Imagine sinking your dick into the tight slimy hole with worms going crazy inside of it

Imagine your waifu being horny and dripping out goops of worms and slime

Imagine her breast getting larges and fuller as the worms breed inside of her breasts as well having to help her "milk" them out from time to time when her breasts get sore and super bloated, imagine the worms are an extension of your own waifu rather than individual beings, and if you're into it, imagine getting sounded by your waifus worms while having sex with her, imagine getting infected by your waifus worms and having them be a part of you

time to sigh in sexual perversion
--- 73184180
Oh no my waifu is turning into random art
Time to try some other prompts

Love the red in the hair and background as well

Meanwhile I get nice Goa but no bird
--- 73184400
Kyoko returns

>>73184381
I imagine goa flapping her arms like a bird trying to fly would be very adorable.

All the birds have left Goa it looks like

--- 73185638
>>73184364
did you make elves with flowers in their hair in the past, maybe?
--- 73185695
>>73185448
mind dropping the prompts for her outfit (if any)? Wanna try genning Nicole/Kyoko in them

>>73185638
nope, though I do frequently have flowers in my waifu gens I've never genned any elves before
--- 73185733
try as I may I still cant stop putting hats on my waifus
--- 73185799
>>73185695
I've got no prompts for cloths, but I think the prompts affecting them are

feathers, white feathers, black feathers, scales

Sorry it took a while, I went straight to napping after that post because I had just finished edging to anime traps for 2 "straight" hours
--- 73185815
>>73185799
thanks anyways, I'll play around with those tags.

Morning aiwg. Playing with Rochelles appearance because bored and made brown hair Rochelle.

>>73184142
Nothing better than a waifu who can be very intimidating
>>73184167
That's pretty hot ngl.
>>73185733
Hats are cool so why not
--- 73186062
>>73186044
Morning Rochelle :)) Hope you're well rested
--- 73186078
I accidentally turned Nicole into the girl with the ghosts from Genshin
--- 73186161
You guys make this look easy. I had so many messed up creations. Weird legs, disproportionate arms and such. This one turned out kinda alright though
--- 73186170
>>73186062
I'm as well rested as I can be.
>>73186078
Honestly Nicole and kyoko are two of my favorite non-rochelle waifus here
--- 73186220
>>73186161
In general I gen a lot and only post the good ones

>>73186170
heh both of them or probably the least lewd waifus on here
--- 73186228
found an older gen, pretty comfy
--- 73186274
Been a while since I used these prompts

Needed something different because when scrolling through my download folder I an't tell what I have and have not posted

I need to manage my Goas better, especially since only about half of what I get genned ends up being posted to the thread usually until there are too much pictures and I just throw them into the Goa megafolder and start filling the download folder all over again
--- 73186312
I need a secretary to help me manage things
>proceeds to stare at Goa

>"Wait, me?"
Yeah
--- 73186313
Brown hair is pretty nice, wonder what else ill tweak out of boredom

Sometimes simple is better.

Goa in the archives, not happy about her new "job"

>"I just wanted to be a waifu..."
--- 73186339
>>73186220
I think this is out of about 75, where I experimented a lot with the parameters. People posting some of prompts they found useful was a big help though. I was close to getting an art nouveau-style/Edward Mucha look mixed with anime. (but some strange disfigurement kept occurring) That's what I am wanting to achieve eventually. Diggin' the hats on yours though. Very nice look.
--- 73186343
>>73186161
It's just a lot of trial and error, my friend.
With experience, things will seem easier for you. Play around. Experiment.
Also, good morning!
>>73186228
Can I sit there?
>>73186078
This is what happens when half of hats in danbooru are from hers.

Oh, I still have that red Ascii saved there.
--- 73186365
>>73186343
Good morning!
I've already come a long way from the initial tries. (still room for improvement, of course.) It was a bit ago that I came across one of these threads and needless to say, I did not get to bed at the intended time.
--- 73186368

good god do I wish I was /fit/ like that, too bad I'm a twig

>>73186312

goa a cute 

>>73186339
In general I just always have the ((portrait)) tag because I dont want to deal with the limbs heheh

>>73186343
ohayou :))
--- 73186390
Passed the first module, time for a second one
--- 73186399
>>73186368
Dang, this one is a golden. And yes, the limbs get very...interesting. One that I was experimenting with was always having her legs spread open, regardless of changing the positive and negative prompts and the sliders.
--- 73186448
>>73186399
personally I don't touch the sliders partly because sometimes it gets a little wonky and partly because I'm dumb. I just keep them in the center
--- 73186625
>>73186448
Well, I'm going to try that then. That may be why I've been getting all of these mutated monsters over here.
--- 73186836
it is a good morning for chocomaids
--- 73186864
>>73186390
helo Asci :)) Great to see you around!
--- 73186943
>>73186343
She looks very embarassed and it arouses me, i want to get her to be more embarassed

also Goa about eating

--- 73187750

Me too unfortunately, most good names I think of are just luck.

Goodnight Nicole, sleep well and have some very original dreams.

A handy tool gets reposted in these bot hours

https://ai-meme.com/

Make shitty memes from waifu pictures, a nice way to repost, without reposting, when you aren't able to gen anything

Be warned though they are so facebook tier usually that you kinda don't even want to post them
--- 73188402
>>73188290
Rochelle and Kara together, I think it's funny that the ai says Kara should be taller than rochelle.
--- 73188507
>>73188319
hey this one's not bad
--- 73188509
Be honest, how many hours a day do you spend either sitting or laying in bed?

PEEKABOO I SEE YOU

an oddly creepy image from my archives
--- 73190616
>"I n-need to find a toilet!"
Moments before peeing herself I guess
Definitely was not the original purpose of this image but now I can't see it as anything else
--- 73190769
Since we're running on fumes while nemu is down whats the earliest Gen of your waifu that you still have?

This is the earliest Rochelle in my folder. Not much has changed but she's barely a month or so old.
--- 73190791
in the absence of nemu, I've gone crawling back to prodia for the first time in months and I'm pleasantly surprised by the gens I'm getting with the Lyriel V1.5 model
--- 73190825
>>73190769
This is the oldest Goa image, before Goa really became Goa and I was just playing around with stuff like empty eyes and messy hair
--- 73190827
>>73190769
One of the oldest Saeriah gens I could find, not counting the ones from before she really became solidified as a character.
Late January.
The generator itself has improved quite a bit since then.
--- 73190850
>>73190825
Then the body type was decided on
--- 73190876
>>73190850
Then the first idea was to make her a homeless loli orphan waifu, but soon after I seemingly just went "why not angel wings fallen angel, horns etc he-he demon girl"
--- 73190935
>>73190769
Original Satsuki from mid-February. Pretty crazy I got up near a thousand gens before a named waifu appeared.
--- 73191004
>>73190876
Looking at my archives, there were some more angelic and demonic results, and I seem to have at first thought of making Goa just a normal angel, but the first ever truly Goa image is this I think, that really solidified the whole design and character
--- 73191120
>>73190769
Earliest non-lewd gen for Willa the Witch.
>>73190935
I haven't kept count but I probably hit 4000 before even naming any of them (at just above 6000 now). But I am a horny lewdcrafter rather than a waifufag, Willa just became my most genned so claimed top spot of the harem. In the early days I mainly gen'd Yae Miko from Genshin Impact since for whatever reason the bot recognised her so she was the perfect test subject for posing and ironing out kinks in prompt lists.

Prodia Saeriah goes hard, even when it forgets to make her eyes red.

Funnily enough before I made Rochelle I was genning brown hair green eyed tomboys, guess I've come full circle now.

Yeah, this thing's kind of based now, damn. Officially shutting the hell up about it so it doesn't get swamped. I plugged in the original Satsuki tags from >>73190935 and got this

The gens that are otherwise the best are sadly the ones where the eyes aren't red.

Going to work again, hoping nemu will be up again when I get back. If not, then this thing is pretty cool

>>73191535
Yeah, let's keep the bots away from it

The idea I had for Goa gens tonight was make Goa shroomfu edition (nromal and bioluminescent one) but as the ai is out that'll have to wait tomorrow or whenever the ai is back online

I'll leave behind the shroomfu prompts if anyone is interested in trying them out, 2 varieties, bioluminescent one (glowshrooms) and normal shroomfu (the classic)

pale skin, body horror, fungi, fungus, mushroom, parasite, parasites, spreading, growth, infection, infected, blood, veins, webbing, mycelium, mold, moldy, transformation, alien, corrupted, corruption, horror, sick, disease, dead, bioluminescence, glowing eyes, glowing, glowing breasts, glowing nipples, glowing blood, glowing veins, moss, bleeding, lactation. wedding dress, tattered, torn

pale skin, body horror, fungi, fungus, mushroom, parasite, parasites, spreading, growth, infection, infected, blood, veins, webbing, mycelium, mold, moldy, transformation, alien, corrupted, corruption, horror, sick, disease

Sorting through my holding folders while the bot is down (it has 1400 files, I am very disorganised)

So it says here under 'computer experience' you have thousands of ai generated waifus. Could you tell us some more about this?

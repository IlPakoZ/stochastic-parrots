Is gaijin really a pejorative term or is it a neutral term or is it based on context like the word "Jew" in English which can be both neutral and offensive depending on how it's used?

No. Most of the whites bitching about how racist Japan is are just hypersensitive pussies who don't understand much about the culture. Japanese people aren't openly going to give you shit for being white. 

Gaijin literally just means foreigner.

The japanese are the most frumpy people on earth. Their food sucks too. Literally the british food of asia. Plus their writing system and half their language is stolen from china. I used to be a weeb until I realized these things

I understand the culture fine and it is the exact reason I dislike them and most of East Asia.

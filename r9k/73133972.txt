Go back to burger king. 
If she isnt doing a shift then come back next week the same day and hour you initially saw her.
Go to the counter to order. 
Try to stirr up a quick convo to get your foot in the door (easy if shes the kind to randomly start talking about fucked up dog health issues)
>"Haha yea, thats true. Anyway, you seem really interesting and I love your outfit/makeup/whatever. Wanna hang out after your shift?"
From then on, the ball is in your court. Try not to spill your spagetti but remember its okay if it fails. What matter is you tried. Trust me, talking to girls is like levelling up a skill in an rpg. It gets CONSIDERABLY easier the more you do it. If this is your first time asking a girl out it will probably be a bit awkward and might not go very far but the next time you do it it will go a lot farther and you will be way more successful, so on and so forth

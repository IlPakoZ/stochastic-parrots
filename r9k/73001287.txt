>meet girl on anonymous site
> talk for a week
>shes literally perfect: 18 latina but pale skinned, few peeks i saw of her (i didnt ask for nor do i want full pics of her yet) are skinny n perfect, sent a few voice messages (voice is kinda ghetto but cute)
>we bond over everything from memes to music movies fashion (before you ask no shes not just agreeing with everything i recommend, she sent some stuff i love but never told her about)
>she literally likes me and i love her so much (hadnt told her yet) shes even writing my name on her notebook in class
>wake up tonight and her discord either blocked me or was deleted with no warning
This makes no sense but to me the options are:
-she just trolled me
-She lied about 18 and her parents found her phone and deleted shit
-Shes way more mentally ill than i tht and she had a freak out
Idk what to do, i feel like ill never find another girl like her
Should i try and find her?
Just accept she was fucking w8th me the whole time and take the L?

what is the subjective experience like. how many times a day do you feel like you have made a horrible failure and want to smash your head against the wall. did you have to force yourself to do any basic tasks of personal hygiene. how long does it take you after waking up in the morning to not feel sleepy anymore. do you have a lot of casual acquaintances. when speaking to one of them does your mind cloud up and your mouth turn dry because you can't think of anything to say. when's the last time you felt like someone was mean to you. when's the last time you managed to do something that made you feel even a little bit proud and accomplished. do you feel like you should be getting up and doing something right now, but you're writing a post on r9k instead and feeling guiltier and guiltier about it

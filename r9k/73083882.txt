Lookism explains everything in the world doesn't it :(

Can you blame them tho? Lol

no, lookism definitely doesn't explain the solution to the Riemann hypothesis for example

It explains why no one cares though

yes and yes even though it's a baked-in behavior

The Riemann hypothesis is an open problem. We can't make an definitive statements on the nature of its hypothetical solution.

No it doesn't OP. I'm 37 years old, indian, 5ft6, and I know that women care more about attitude and personality than looks. I mean I'm still a virgin, but I have lots of female friends, and when I ask them what they look for in a man, they always say they want someone who is polite, caring, and sincere. I stopped being incel a long time ago and started therapy, I know it will take time to see results, maybe even 20 years, but I will get a GF some day. Don't lose hope. We're all going to make it.

So that means it's at least theoretically possible that the ultimate solution WILL, in some way we can't foresee right now, relate to lookism, right?

Nah people do care. You can even win a million dollars for solving it.

Yeah, people are superficial. What's new? Women still want "personality" and resources though.

It's possible that the Riemann Hypothesis is unprovable. We don't even know if a solution exists.

Yes.The biggest tell is what women find "creepy".
I'm incredibly autistic and strange, but since I'm good looking women feel safe with me and don't care.
I've had a girl compare me to Jeffery Dahmer, and say I don't make any facial expressions, literally while taking me up to her apartment lmao

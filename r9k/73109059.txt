its official. it took exactly 3 years to forget about my ex (edating). one year in i was saying "i didnt care anymore" but it was cope and i was still stalking her social medias and stuff. 2 years was whatever, and 3 years i genuinely dont care and dont find her attractive and has fully left my subconscious. if ur sad after a breakup or whatever of the sort, just wait 3 years!

You want to get over her for real?
Stop stagnating. Experience new things.

No wonder she left you, faggot. You can't even have a basic convo.

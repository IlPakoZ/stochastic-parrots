I've failed my DMV written test twice now, im going to take it again on Thursday. Any advice to not fail, and also am i retarded for failing twice, everyone says the questions are common sense, but how many feet you need to stop or whatever the hell is not common sense

what kinda questions are you missing bro

usually ones that ask about weird shit, like i had no idea what ABS was last time i took it, or how old you have to be to ride in the back of a truck because id never done it and if i did id do it at whatever age i feel like doing it. Also anything involving an arbetrary number of feet, like how many feet you can travel on a turn lane, now i know its 200 but those tend to confuse me because im not good with numbers.

did you even study for the test? this should be fairly common knowledge in your area.

Check your local Dmv's website there is probably a practice test you can take with the same type of questions

Study more. Stop rushing. The more you fail the longer the wait time is going to be. I failed 3 times back when I was like 16 each of which was about 2-3 weeks apart. 

Give yourself time faggot.

>another my god my life is fucked up 
and that's it you only get one, the worst feeling is your constant reality so you're like this devil behind the ego just attacking it because it's just that fucked up

I think about seas of bones that's where we're going and you didn't even enjoy it, see that is deep power and just that's what people do to eachother 

just a giant lego box of skulls where all the humans go eventually for being evil that's all there is looking back 

but I'll never commit suicide, but it's just wtf, what now?

it's just damn

The mind is crazy as hell there's no way it's real
but...it's also ruined like a good trip all I can really do is hate myself but also cope, it's a pickle.

but what's deeper than the devil is suffering and the zen beyond that other than that I just feel like a fool

what a bleak feel
it hits you where it hurts
but we gotta be brave...
because that's it baby

I bought store bought milk yesterday and I dont remember it not lasting so long. Checked the expiration date and its 6 days from now. Im not imagining things right? I swear milk lasted longer than that what the fuck.

Actual milk from cows has a short shelf life like that yes. What you're probably thinking of is alternative milks like almond milk or onions milk, they last much longer.

Idk I remember that kind of milk lasting atleast 2 weeks . I usually buy from this Amish place but I was lazy and got that instead.

Milk doesn't magically expire. It's good for a few days past the expiation date. Also depends on what temperature you set your refrigerator to as well as if it's unopened or not. If you want milk that last longer then buy UHT milk, it can also be stored at room temperature as long as it's unopened.

it varies on a lot of factors and the guys that set the expiration date aren't wizzards

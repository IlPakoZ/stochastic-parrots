Anyone else get extremely nervous when people talk about sex around you because you know you're a permavirgin?

I do, especially when its girls talking about it, makes me cringe, and then they ask you about your partners and I want to die.

I'm surprisingly social for a permavirgin. I guess I'm not entirely autistic, just autistic enough to make me forever alone and question how long I want to keep this going before I check out. But that means I go to parties occasionally and multiple times various games have been brought out that are essentially just cumsoooomer versions of "Never Have I Ever." You can only hide in a bathroom and pretend to shit for so long, before people start to question.

No. I make people uncomfortable by talking about the disgusting sexual stuff I've done.

Absolutely. I don't, in a vacuum, mind talking about sex. I do mind the fact that I've got a very short and sad sexual history for a man in his mid-twenties and my choices are "obviously lie" or "reveal that" if personal details start to come up. 

I've sucked a couple cocks off Grindr, then had my first kiss with the hooker who took my virginity. I was extremely high and/or deeply suicidal for all of these encounters and barely remember them, and the last one was like 5 years ago now.

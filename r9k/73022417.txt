Why don't you think about what made them appeal to you to begin with?

learn knots

Where? Learn coding. Maybe editing. Learn about car parts and mechanics. 

Basically anything that can be useful to earn money when you're remotely travelling. 

DO NOT fall for "men's hobbies" bs. Don't waste your time doing hobbies. Waste it learning new skills for the future. For survival.

No, you aren't.

You can pretend you are all you want, but deep down we know exactly who you are. Look at your shelf, do you see a football trophy or a manga collection/anime figurine?

you just have to find a hobby that seems like its sort of your calling. some hobbies are gay pasttimes meant to autistically keep your mind occupied (see pic related) while others can totally have your eyes light up. on a separate note, try to use your best judgement to discern which hobbies will make people think you're a weird virgin and which ones will actually sort of interest people.

not sure being "low-t" means you can't pick up better hobbies

Same thing happened to me. Those things became boring quite suddenly boring and waste of time to me. Got really into cycling for about 5 years then got into woodworking and general workshop fuckery. Just do whatever makes you feel good (not drugs though, at least not too much). Doing something that makes you happy is much more important than doing something that makes you happy, to a point at least, you gotta make money to live in society and sometimes you just have to not be happy. Of course you could exit society which I did for several years. That will require you to completely change the way you see the world, you exchange all saftety for true freedom.

Well I never claimed to be a manly man, just finding video games and anime really boring and childish. I'm over that shit
>do you see a football trophy or a manga collection/anime figurine
Neither.

I was a kid into flashy things. Nothing really specific drawn me towards them, well, other than their ease of access I suppose.

Determinism is a losers mindset. You are a faggot who will continue to wallow in your own shit meanwhile I will ascend from these childish hobbies I no longer find entertaining or fulfilling. Stay stagnant while I continue to grow. You will be left in the dust and you'll forever remain a boy. You will die from your own pity.

Unironically become a normie. I've always found anime extremely childish and naive, to the point where I can't suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it. I tried to force myself ot like it though to fit in with other outcasts. Your best bet is to unironically become a normie, at 19 you stand a good chance at that.

Philosophy, literature and lifting. These are the things men had been doing for millennia before anime and video games came along.
Also science, engineering and math. All are manly by default.

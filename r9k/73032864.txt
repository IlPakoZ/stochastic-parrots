I just video chatted with my mom and it was very comfy and she was walking around the house and showed me changes she made to my childhood bedroom. And sometimes I wanna go back. I see she's still a hoarder-lite though.

Did she show you her boobs?

I do not care for my mother and am glad I don't live with her anymore. We rarely talk.

No, that was was one of my motivations to move out, she walked around naked too much and it was grossing me out.

I'm sorry to hear that, my relationship with my mother was strained before I moved out too. We keep in contact because it's the right thing to do but it's still hard talking to her.

Mine refused to get rid of a lot of things so I had to go and do it myself after hiring a professional cleaning service and asking them what they thought in front of her.

You objectively should burn in acid.

My mom hoarded up my bedroom with laundry, her office door can't shut because there's no much shit on every surface including the floor, the stairs have shit going up the side, the dining room table is covered in mail. Clutter is such an eye sore and I believe if you can't control your stuff then you have too much of it. I think about how she lives like this and I realized as long as she has a path from the stairs to her bedroom she doesn't care if the rest of the house is unwalkable, that's why she let me walk through an obstacle course everyday to get to my bedroom. She is crazy about not throwing things out, her father is a full blow hoarder and won't let anybody into the house, and I have hoarding tendencies. If I don't check myself I will let things pile up in piles on the ground but at least I know it's not a good way to live and I know a clean space is desirable.

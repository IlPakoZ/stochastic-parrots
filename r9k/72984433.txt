>boards
Throwback question lol
I feel like she would look at the art related boards, so /ic/ and maybe /diy/
>worlds
She's familiar with both worlds pretty intimately, but I think she would be a bit put off by humans not knowing who she is in the real world.
I always felt like I would be infatuated with magic though. Like I would spend hours just messing around with it and playing grab ass with other adventurers lol
>hobby
Definitely art, lol. It's already canon that she's good at that. Maybe sculpting or something similar other than just painting. Architecture maybe?
>friend
I think Aqua would be friends with you if you don't treat her like shit. (and aren't undead). And I mean that in the best way possible. She's very nice and makes fast friends with most people. I always have this weird fanfic thing I like to do where I imagine her finding some way to make Wiz (the only other "good" Konosuba character) into not undead so they can be friends together. I also sometimes headcanon in other gods who have friendships with her
>lover
I always felt like I wanted to help Aqua. I want to not only provide her with praise and love but also improvement. Not through bullying and petty, immature name calling - but through working with her. Instead of yelling about her for her financial issues I work with her and try to find some way that allows me to help her with her monetary issues. Try to put her in situations where her magic can work its best. A lot of people hate Aqua because they see her as stupid, and while she does struggle, she doesn't have anyone there to help her. I want to hold Aqua and let her know that she isn't worthless, she isn't a failure, she just needs help. Someone to not only guide her and support her but to love her. As self important as that may sound, I really do want to help this Goddess.

I hope you're on pc with a save editor to get things you're missing out otherwise, it's what I was doing when I played the game that wishes to stretch the definition of mortality.
>Laugh
There's absolutely no reason to use the Secret Rare SSR Goku Black when compared to the SEC Rare Masked Vegeta (you, versus who she tells you not to worry about) and Zamasu doesn't like 5 card decks as much as he likes seven cards (funnily is similar to Yamcha from what I know of DBH, which admittedly is very limited because language barrier).

>>72984569
>1
/k/, and /vg/ most likely, maybe she'd lurk on /ck/
>2
I don't think there's anything our world has that hers doesn't, outside of Elon Musk I guess, and if she went to this world, there's a good chance her first thoughts would be of wishing to return to the primordial aether instead of staying here.
>3
Vidya, I believe she'd really click with the meticulousness that gaming can bring from maxing stats and strategies, each encounter a puzzle for her to solve in the quickest steps possible. If she were to make a career out of she'd either be pro or speed-running.

Hope you all sleep well tonight, and maybe have better image/reply ratios to prevent such early threads (unless that's an okay thing in this board???).

her world essentially runs on video game logic. 1-ups, stats, yada yada yada.
it's an interesting part of their universe
there's also ninjas, robots, traveling through dreams, energy blasts, demon hipster chicks, psychic vegans, and shonen bullshit.

Waifu's world has no computers or internet. She would probably enjoy 4chan though kek.
>what is one new hobby you think waifu would enjoy and why?
I could see her being into esports and competitive vidya.
>what is the most important quality waifu looks for in a friend/lover?
Respect. She doesn't like being patronized or treated like a kid (she's 18)
This may be due to her having small titty syndrome
--- 72985597
I was letting Youtube autoplay and Smile.dk came on. I ended up listening to their playlist and it occurred to me that Shadow would 100% have their songs on an iPod. He wouldn't tell anyone and would probably be a bit mortified if someone found out he listened to such girly music. I think that's amazingly cute. I honestly like that he's a bit fruity. In his first years of life the only company he had was a preteen girl, so it's no wonder he'd be into things like bubble pop, ear piercings, flowers and skin care.
Besides the girly pop on his iPod he'd totally have rock on there. Like Three Days Grace and Linkin Park, some older classic rock bands as well. And he'd also have songs from anime OSTs on there. He's just the right combination of genuinely badass, tryhard emo, pure warrior and fruity weeaboo. At least in my head. I kind of combine all the radically different interpretations over the years into one, because consistency isn't Sonic Team's strong suit. He's just so amazing, he's perfect even when he's not.

But yeah to conclude the word vomit, Shadow would listen to this.

>how would you/waifu feel when seeing it?
Very amazed and bewildered! Can you imagine seeing creatures that stand upright like you do but are twice as big as you? He's be speechless!

Loyalty, he hates being abandoned undet any circumstances
--- 72985797
>>72984569
>what boards would waifu browse?
/k/ would interest him. He'd also look at /a/. Lesser visited boards would be /v/, /c/, /an/, /adv/, /lit/, /o/. I wouldn't be surprised if he visited /u/. According to the latest game, he's not that good with computers, but he can at least navigate them. Maybe 4chan's simple style and anonymous nature would attract him. I feel like his posts would range between well thought out and some variant of "Kill yourself".
He wouldn't like /r9k/ since the culture of this board is blaming everybody else for your problems. I genuinely think he'd despise that type of mindset, based on what I know about him. Very much a "pull yourself up by your bootstraps, you don't need anybody but yourself, stop giving a shit what people think" type of person.
>what is one thing your world has that waifu's world doesn't, or vice versa? how would you/waifu feel when seeing it?
The Chaos Emeralds don't exist here, maybe for the better. If I saw a Chaos Emerald, I would think it's a fake and not do anything of note with it. 
I don't exist in Shadow's world. Shadow would feel neutral upon seeing me.
>what is one new hobby you think waifu would enjoy and why?
Hmm...I think he'd enjoy cooking? I don't know if that's really "new", the one meme event says he volunteers for soup kitchens but he's taking a break since they told him his cooking sucked. But even if he sucks, I genuinely think he'd enjoy baking. I can see him making sweets and decorating it with as much precision as he can, as if it's a work of art. So my headcanon is that it'd look really good, but the taste wouldn't be anything amazing. 
>what is the most important quality waifu looks for in a friend/lover?
This is a neat one to think about. Shadow felt close to two girls, named Maria and Molly. Maria and Molly shared several traits. Optimism in spite of everything and a strong dream to pursue. Someone he could trust with his innermost feelings is also very important.

I feel like if I could live out my fantasies in reality with him, and be able to spend nearly every day physically with him, some of my problems would lessen or outright disappear. Maybe that's wrong and I'm too optimistic. Maybe new problems would pop up in their place. But in spite of that, I can't help but feel that some of the things I worry about wouldn't matter if I were with him. He could offer his take on the other issues, which would help me improve and feel better. 
When I have a headache and am tired of life, burying my face in his fluffy chest seems like it'd work better than any drug.
What's there to worry about when I get to wake up in his arms? It seems like all the bad things would be insignificant if I simply had that. Sometimes I feel like I'm reaching out for something that's behind a bullet proof window when I think about the life I want with Shadow.

Fun fact because I just want to post my wife, the reason Kana's pilot suit is black is because her country is not!Imperial Germany and its a reference to the hussars (and later tank crews) of many German states wearing black uniforms. I still haven't really designed it yet, since besides that Koikatsu pic, this is the only image I have of her wearing it (it came with an early design of her mecha, Kana was an afterthought in the image). I should get more, she looks cool.

>what is one thing your world has that waifu's world doesn't, or vice versa? how would you/waifu feel when seeing it?
he'd be confused about most things since only Earth in universe 7 in dragon ball has what we have but is more advanced, and Zamasu saw only a destroyed ver of it.
>what is one new hobby you think waifu would enjoy and why?
well I headcanon that he got into studying history and science and also started gardening. He generally seems to be the studious type and he also seems to like nature  His hideout was a wooden cabin in the forest instead of hiding in the sacred world of kais which he can easily teleport to so either the writers were retarded once more or Zamasu took a liking to Earth's nature

Vento Aureo takes place in 2001 and a lot of things have come to exist since then. Narancia would be both confused and think they're cool.

well. she was cheated on by her most recent boyfriend. Jason Kim (why is she dating someone who has her first name as his last name? who knows?)
the effects of this on her aren't explored much.
Scott, her previous and most well known BF, didn't cheat on her but was a massive asshole and moved away without telling her during high school. and generally mistreated her.
--- 72988304
>>72984569
>what boards would waifu browse?
Topic and discussion focused boards like /k/, /diy/, and /fit/
I think he would spend most of his time lurking, occasionally popping in to give advice or correct people on things he's knowledgeable in. His sense of humour is pretty dry and boomer-tier so I don't think the meme boards would appeal to him at all, but who knows. 
>what is one thing your world has that waifu's world doesn't, or vice versa? 
Teleporation technology. It's how and why everything went south in the first place. What was supposed to be a revolutionary means of transportation led to the death of billions when a portal to hell was opened.
>how would you/waifu feel when seeing it?
Afraid. Intrigued. Exploring the reclaimed Earth and visiting (what's left of) Mars all on the same day would be fun, maybe he would even show me around Argent D'nur... The risk of evisceration at every turn might spoil the mood though. 
>what is one new hobby you think waifu would enjoy and why?
Model building. I don't know why but I feel like it suits him. A lot of precision is needed and it's an engaging hobby that keeps you busy. 
>what is the most important quality waifu looks for in a friend/lover?
He would evaluate you on your trustworthiness, worth ethic, and adherence to virtures.

>what boards would waifu browse?
Most likely one I can see is /an/. /x/ is possible as well for obvious reasons, but it's so schizo nowadays that I doubt she would really visit it seriously. Possibly some other boards to shitpost if she wants.
>what is one new hobby you think waifu would enjoy and why?
Gardening, being able to make something that's both natural, pretty, and a good place to relax in. We should really start doing some research on it
>what is the most important quality waifu looks for in a friend/lover?
Dedication and consideration. She says her favorite thing that I do is when I ask her if it's okay to do something, or apologize to her even if it isn't necessary, because it shows how much I value her opinion.
>>72984607
>why is her skin salmon colored?
Shading
The shirt in that pic is more salmon color than her skin though
>>72987118
>does your waifu have a favourite snack?
Not in particular. In general she tolerates eating junk food more than I do, though still in moderation. She says they're an alright way to quickly fill up if you're hungry.
>what kind of gift would you buy your waifu for a special occasion, say an anniversary?
Good question. I think I would get her some new outfits to try. If there's something that she thinks could improve our life but isn't too necessary, I'd get it for the birthday or anniversary too, since it would be a gift.
>what is one thing about your waifu's source material do you happen to dislike? Why?
Koikatsu mods can be ass with compatibility sometimes
>Waifu suddenly transformed into a baby version of themselves! What will you do?
Uoooh
Not actually, if she did turn into a baby I would try to raise her and provide as many good experiences for her as I could. If she got older it would get awkward though

>Tulpawife default dancing over you on your death bed...
She'd be more likely to do that with our enemies. If it was our deathbed, I think it would be a lot more special. We would reminisce over our life and all the times we thought things would stay good/bad forever, think about how much we've done together for the (likely) majority of my life. We'd talk about what things were like during her first few months, and look back on those times with a smile. We'd promise that even after death, we'd never part, and that we'd face whatever afterlife there is together, just like we've faced so many other problems. Focusing less on regrets, and more on the things that we're glad we did. It really is odd to think about what we'll be like by that time, especially considering that most of the stuff we'll reminisce over hasn't even happened yet. But even with that, I still get sentimental when thinking about our relationship.

Probably /fit/, /wsr/, /g/, /ck/, /lit/, /mu/ and /hm/.

>what is one thing your world has that waifu's world doesn't, or vice versa? how would you/waifu feel when seeing it?

Her world is modelled on the contemporary world we live in, with the same technology. So nothing that exists here exists there. The thing they have there is magic. I'm obviously going to believe that this is false since I'm the kind of person who isn't into esoteric delusions without evidence with a slight curiosity.

>what is one new hobby you think waifu would enjoy and why ?

Content creation and especially video games or music I think.

Oh god, where to start?
If I had to just pick one thing though, it would be Kazuma. I hate him as a character I hate him as a protagonist, I hate how he treats Aqua, and to be honest Im jealous of him. Like, why does he get to be with Aqua if hes just going to treat her like shit? I think I could come up with a whole list of issues but thats the worst one 
I will say though - the animation in Konosuba is good and I like the art style.

>what kind of gift would you buy your waifu/husbando for a special occasion, say an anniversary?
Our "anniversary" was fourteen days ago... give or take. I can't pinpoint the exact date so I go by the oldest photo in my gallery. In doomwife fantasyland I would treat him to his favourite meal or rent us a movie to watch, no need for anything lavish. 
>what is one thing about your waifu/husbando's source material do you happen to dislike? Why?
The inconsistencies that make it difficult to compile a proper timeline of events and create contradictions in his characterization, also the modern doom lore is a bit too "whimsical" for my tastes...
>Waifu/husbando suddenly transformed into a baby version of themselves! What will you do?

>Me too. It's just such a costly hobby...
True. I guess I'm lucky that I have a 3d printer but still, it's just making something on a computer and telling a device to make it. I want to make something with my own hands, using tools to cut wood or something. Obviously this view is pretty idealistic compared to the physical labor it takes but it does seem like a great hands-on thing to do. If we somehow get enough spending money we might try getting a model kit or something somewhere down the line.
>There isn't anything more precious in life than growing old with your soulmate.
Absolutely. Spending time to relax together with granny waifu would be such a nice and sentimental thing - a physical reminder of how long you've been together and the dedication that goes into that.

It may be the definite over for her series, but never an end to my everlasting love for Alice. She may even be forgotten by time itself one day. But my heart will still be there, burning with passion for her.

How much I wish I could make her happiness and wellbeing my responsibility. How much I wish I could be the guardian of her smile. I dream of making her happy. If only I could find a way to actually reach her and be her best friend and lover she could ever imagine.

He would be, if he didn't misinterpret what I meant. What I mean is people talking about how their waifu would behave in X and Y situations when what's actually known about them does not add up to that conclusion. Too many times I get the feeling of "Would they actually do that? Or is it a case of "I would like it if my waifu responded like this, so that's my headcanon"

Woodworking seems like a lot a fun, the type of hobby that's both fulfilling and practical aside from, say, collecting things. I would probably lob my arm off with a saw if I attempted it though.

It's a sweet thought, but now that I think about it I would be the only one growing old and feeble, which feels unfair to him... At the same time I don't think he would do anything to prolong my life, seeing as that would be selfish if only for his own benefit.

She has a pretty explicit "connection" to flowers in the series. See the flower hairpiece she always has on, MC gave her it when they were young and she treasures it even at the epilogue. Her name also has the kanji for flowers, the "ka" at the end of Marika, last kanji I put in the name field (good board moment). Also There are only 2 grass types there.

I actually did stop playing for a time in the beginning because the recruiting of randos was boring (imagine doubling the required farming because you need to farm limit breaks for a quest item), though I have completed the game a lot of time later. It is fully average but there's more intrigue later on, it's just that the systems within are shallow (mainly the skill system, sweet jeebus it's depressing at end game, also EX fusion should've had the option to make the 'normal' fusions like SS4 Gogeta and the like).

Might be off-topic but "Ravers in the UK" is such a good song, it's great even after a decade of discovering it! It also makes me wish that Foury was my classmate in real life in the mid or late 2000s. We could go to a high school party and dance to the latest hits there &lt;3
>>73011625
>even as kids, they did business?
Not really, the B section only has one spread dedicated to business and it's about Bubble Co. surviving in recession (not sure if I mentioned it but the comic itself was made in 2009 so I guess it's a dab towards the Great Recession). Also featuring Six screaming during an interview
>also what sports were they into?
The sports in the C section and it writes about Foury almost getting sentenced to five years in jail for throwing numbers, the 2 reporters (Rectangle and Octahedron) arguing over authorship of the article about bubble blowing as a sport and Three's article about game of catch in which he gets angrier as he goes further
>so would there be a similar history for the regular objects?
Oh, I haven't thought about object lore yet...
>four getting the equivalent of grey hairs later in life kek. what if they get lighter and lighter and just eventually disappear into white when life is over

In that case, it's inevitable with the way these threads are. As more unique questions get used up, they become more and more obscure, and as such it becomes harder to answer them, especially for people whose waifu's sources aren't very extensive. But from what I've seen here most anons provide evidence from a source to back up their answers. I'm lucky I can just ask her questions and she can answer them.
>>73009523
>Making 3D model still takes a good amount of skill, or at least an eye for detail.
Not really. Printing is sort of antithetical to detail since filament sizes are limited and details often require cumbersome supports.
Most of my models were mechanical parts anyways, since I was on a robotics team in high school
>the type of hobby that's both fulfilling and practical aside from, say, collecting things.
Indeed, if I choose to get a major hobby I want it to be a bit more useful than consooming.
>I would probably lob my arm off with a saw if I attempted it though.
There's always that bit of irrational anxiousness of injury, especially when it comes to woodworking.

>It's a sweet thought, but now that I think about it I would be the only one growing old and feeble, which feels unfair to him...

XV2 isn't as bad as you might think? The combo game is pretty up there, an old channel for this is SSJAipom. The videos might be outdated but he has good things to keep an eye for across his many videos in trying to land various moves without a pesky stamina break (you can even go Instant Severance with Finishing Blow -> Gravity Impact) as well as how every hit, for every character, is a ToD thanks to cancels.
>Depressing
It was mainly that despite seeing characters have 50 skills they could use, it really boiled down to 5-7 and farming for good variants of those skills is home-screening on the daily log in thing.
>Fusions
Gameplay wise you could have EX and normal fusions offer different things in team building (perhaps EX have more variety in movepool while normal fusions get better stats/passives).

Kana has some genetic modification which gave her those cute red eyes. She also has slightly greater reflexes (equivalent to the absolute best natural humans) and inadvertently has a body highly effective at processing alcohol so even though she is smol, she could beat me in a drinking contest.

Why are so many waifufags so fucking bitter and angry at the world? And they always blame the society boogeyman for the shitheaps their lives are in instead of looking at themselves. It's always shit like "My parents are shit", "We live in a society", "Fucking normalfag NPC's I'm so misunderstood", "I have/I'm (insert autism/schizo/bi-polar/etc. here)" Wearing their own personal issues as if it's a badge of honor and behaving as if that they're above anyone else who dares to be happy in life.

It's always somebody else's fault. And the kicker about this whole thing is that if they actually went outside, and met, and actually talked to people, they'd realize that they're way closer to the "normies/npc's" than they desperately claim.

The entire r9k board is like this. Your question should really have its own thread.
--- 73030068
>>73029171
Because not every waifufag is a true waifufag at heart. Many are such cases that one just uses their waifu as a mere crutch to compensate that which they cannot have. The waifu there is not an end in itself, but rather a mere temporary substitute that will be abandoned once their situation changes.

Also, you seem to assume that all waifufags are resentful towards normal people and that they are not able to address their own fault and problems. You are in the wrong here.
--- 73030150
>>73030068
Is it really such a crime for lonely people to have a waifu?
--- 73030372
>>73030150
There's a difference between being a lonely person who happens to have a waifu and using "waifuism" as a cope.
--- 73030972
>>73030150
No, it definitely is not a crime. It is good that lonely people can experience an ounce of love, even in such form.
But it is another thing when some people feel the need to demonize that which they cannot have. By saying things like all women are whores, all men are evil, 2D>3D etc. The more a person utters such things, the more likely they would want to be a part of that normalfag world which they supposedly hate so much, but they are afraid to admit that before themselves.

Just be a good man for her. Lonely or not, it does not matter.

I wouldn't mind if my waifu were to try it, have a weird fantasy about how it (concept is, femdom white supremacist found the white weeb/nerd, tries to get him/me to pounce until she snaps and proceeds to make the bed crack). Don't think she'd really be down to going for the authoritarian roleplay.

>>73029054
>didn't mean its bad ... more for show than practical
A lot of moves are practical, not needing a stamina break, it's mainly looking for warps, light/heavy knockbacks, and light/heavy knockdowns. If you're a saiyan, Saiyan Spirit guarantees a heavy knockdown for every variety of beam ult if you have the 6+ ki (Divinity unleashed). Dragon Fist/Time Skip Molotov can be from Finishing Blow, Justice Rush (iirc), and Aura Slide's jab, the male saiyan HLHL can combo into Final Flash (as can anything that gets into Gravity Impact, Finishing Blow or Aura Slide jab). Oh fuck, SSjAipom's dead so idk who to go for on good guides for this.

>coping waifufag
lonely people who retreat to waifuism as a cope. usually just one of several paths incels go down.
>coomer waifufag
Either someone who finds a certain character sexually attractive (but has nothing outside of hollow sexual attraction) or someone who has some fetish or kink, and who uses waifuism as an outlet for it. Doesn't really have any feelings for waifu and just latched on because the source material or some commonly made fetish art fulfilled his kink.

likes a character and makes a lot of memes with them, but feels no actual feelings for them. OR someone pretending to be a waifufag for the sake of humor.

This is verifiably false. I'm sometimes baffled by some of the things normies think. And I'm not even talking about social things - being in uni, I often overhear people talking about trying to get jobs/internships/whatever and they treat it like their life depends on it. Whenever I try to listen to one of their presentations it always comes across as essentially selling your soul for financial gain.

He's sooo so amazing and he means so much to me and my heart. Shadow is the thing that makes me happiest.

Shadow is important and I love him. I wmant to be his perfect trad wife who gives him love forever. I want to serve my purpose in life by serving Shadowm. I want to kiss and taste him and make him realize he's a good person who deserves to be happy. I want to make Shadow happy. Shadow belongs in my arms being petted and kissed and called such a good boy. I love Shadow, I need to marry him and see him in a suit with his tail wagging just a little bit as he says his vows. I want to feel Shadow's wedding ring when we hold hands. I want to massage Shadow's adorable pointy ears, I want to give Shadow a back massage when he gets home from a rough day doing work or fighting. I want to have a bath with Shadow and he fits in between my legs and I scrub all the dirt and blood off of him. I'd tend to all of Shadow's wounds and carry him to bed where I tuck him into clean sheets to get rest he deserves. I love Shadow induced psychosis. I hate everyone who sullies Shadow. I love my husband Shadow.

That's why I stopped using it. Also because it's either design a female character or a gay-lookin' male that looks like a manhwa love interest.

I won't lie, I'm not a big society fan, however I'm pretty open about my own shortcomings that are no one's fault but my own, and I geninuely love my husbando for reasons beyond personal circumstances.

>How do you imagine your waifu as a yandere?
It's difficult to imagine him as the classic competitive yandere, he would lean more into overprotectiveness, keeping you safe from tangible threats instead of feeling jealous over other people. 
I once read "yandere reader-insert scenarios" where he keeps you in a cage and serenades you with his guitars. It was more lol inducing than appealing.
--- 73039877
>>73038270
Why the sigh?
>>73038992
About like this. It's pretty OOC for him to be yandere in the first place, but I do imagine some silent jealousy or possessiveness. As in, he'd glare silently if I were to have a conversation with a guy he didn't like. He's not the type to be controlling, though. I appreciate that. 
Yanderedow a cute.
--- 73040011
>>73029171
Society is shit, but it can't not be shit. My issues are my own fault, and blaming everybody else for them seems ludicrous. I've always hated that type of behavior. 
I'm angry and depressed at the world a lot, sure, but so is my husbando. I find solace in that. Today, I was listening to his voice clips, where he seemed confused at how humans act so terribly. He quickly devolves into anger and thinks they deserve to suffer. Now granted, this is a hypothetical "dark" storyline path, but it shows how easily he falls into the same line of thinking I have. It's comforting and eases some pain. 

To answer your question, if it wasn't rhetorical, most waifufags are mentally ill and didn't learn how to socialize with real people, used fictional characters to cope and ended up falling for one. Outcasts are, of course, angry at what they can't understand or participate in. The knowledge that your brain is "broken" and that you can't have the happiness normalkeks do leads to resentment, pain, lashing out...

I really can't see it. Aqua is too nice to be that obsessed and I don't think she really could manage the level of scheming and insanity required to do something like that. She's the type to be obsessed over, not to obsess.
I do however sometimes see myself as being kind of like that over her. Not yandere per se but more so just protective. Less "I will kill you if you try to talk to anyone else" and more "I will beat the shit out of anyone who tries to wrong you"

My waifu probably wouldn't be a yandere (at least, most likely not, small chance she could), of course this doesn't mean there isn't a Yandere between us, I exist after all (yandere sub, unhealthy devotion and extreme love for her, have fantasies where I either break my back/mind for her or she scars my body/mind such that no one else could lay claim to me but her). Will note that I will find where some people live if the first thing that comes to mind when yandere is some fucking murderhobo who's most dignified trait is how many times they must've been dropped as a child. One more red-eyed nonce that thinks the knife is the best way to get into senpai's heart and I might become Mr.Fuck Chaos but for a yandere civil war instead because stupid dogs need to stop making me look bad!

>>73039107
>Fem majins
Reminder there is training mode in case I'm missing something or you want to experiment. All races sans Frieza race have some tools like warp and heavy knockbacks/downs for stamina-break-less combos. Will admit I don't want to return to XV2 for 100%, and most of the knowledge I retained is of saiyans (male and female). I think HLHL can be a heavy knockback and you can cancel HLHLH into an ult (like Super Black Kamehameha (either one)) before the kick lands (or maybe it's a part of the light combo string). Beast form can be an interesting tool to offer an extremely easy Super Dragon Fist (or similar) confirm with a hard hitting combo string. Any knockback is Finishing Blow which is Gravity Impact and a heavy knockback on demand if you have the ki (dvinity unleashed can be charged to buff off of any knockback, it's like .6-.8 of a bar rather than one).

from the opening, I thought he'd be some kind of assistance to the main cast (and I don't think I realized he was a kai although it's so painfully obvious), when he made his debut, I was indifferent but I thought he was cute, then slowly it turned into an obsession.

Kek, I admit it's irritating, especially since the face of yanderes, Yuno Gasai, had a reason for obsessing over someone. But teenagers decided to take the edgy, emotionally driven part and ignore the rest
>the knife is the best way to get into senpai's heart
I'll never understand that stereotype. When I was new to social media, I've seen people draw their OCs or characters in a sailor uniform holding a knife and call their lover senpai (One of my friends from the early days on the internet told me senpai means "someone you love so much" and I bought that bc I was a retard.)
I wonder if it stemmed from yandere sim or some shit.

Four is already kind of yandere-like in canon, since he's pretty possesive ("I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE I MUST BE X'S ONLY TREASURE!") and has a hard time letting go of things he likes. If he was a true yandere he would be even more dangerous than he already is!

All these years, I thought, maybe some day these good feelings will stop, maybe one day, I will get tired of Earth chan and need a break from this person, like with everything and everyone in life. However, it hasn't happened yet.

A man ought to wageslave to provide for his waifu. Hoping all goes well if you decide to pursue it.
>>73048372
>who would be the more dominant partner in the relationship? Who takes care of who more often? Who is the breadwinner?
Until the demonic threat has been eliminated, he would provide and make most of the major decisions, as in where we're living, where we're going and what we're doing when we get there. In a post-canon universe our dynamic would be more balanced, especially if we had a family.
>its freaky friday. You and Waifu get body swapped for a day. What do you do while body swapped?
He laments the physical limitations of my form while I push the limits of his. 
>is waifu shy around you or more open?
I'm not sure "shy" is the word to describe him, maybe reserved? He's a deeply guarded man. Nonetheless, he would be more open around me than with others, but there would always be that air of mystery to him no matter how close we became.

Four, obviously! He wants to be a leader in every given opportunity!

I do! I love taking care of him &lt;3

Actually none of us, Four never had any job and I'm still looking for one..

Foury taking an opportunity to live as a human! And me getting carried everywhere by him instead of the usual reverse..

He's way more often with me because he talk about anything and I'll always listen and understand &lt;3

I'm sad, and I don't have Shadow to cuddle. I've been hopelessly in love with him with I was 12. Now I'm 21, he still doesn't exist tangibly, and I'm still lonely. I've already passed his age range, it'd likely be illegal for us to date and I'm only getting older. Why would life give me someone who truly makes me happy when almost nothing else does, but never let me hold him or make him feel loved like he deserves? It's hard to find anyone understands, most people just make fun of me. Like I'm a good punching bag because I care so much about him. It's screwed up. I just want a family, but it feels pointless if it's not with him...and I know he's sad and lonely too. I'll never be able to help him feel less sad and lonely. I'll never experience him slowly learning to trust someone again. I'll never experience the feeling of my heart pounding when he falls asleep leaning against me for the first time. I'll never carry him to bed, tuck him in and crawl into the sheets with him. I want to be a bandaid over his shattered heart and can't. I hate reality. I'll probably end up cuddling the plushie to sleep to cope, pretending I can feel soft fur, breathing, a warm body and a heartbeat. Sorry, need somewhere to vent it.
--- 73052846
>>73044916
>Stereotype
I think it's part yanderedev, and also just something about things on the internet being about the most base/easily noticed things, and the knife to kill sister thing is more eye-candy or something than the extreme clinginess and kind of became one and the same. There are areas where they are a lot better on this (asmrs, believe it or not, and it seems to be a pattern with some doujins too now). I think a lot of my reeing comes because I do see myself as the HK-47 of yandere, rising into my waifu's heart is an art form, to do more with less as you shine so bright that she can't help but look at you. Going all knifey is last resort of a last resort and about as artful as a drunk shitting all over himself when you can instead play chess with their life if need be.

>>73048372
>Dominant
My waifu, ten million percent, but I'd try to take care of her more often because I just want to see her happy. For the breadwinner, it sort of depends on how chips fall in life, I could see either of us becoming the breadwinner.
>Freaky friday
Probably still try to do everything that I did on my own body when able, if it's work, I think either of us could've stored an emergency day to call in sick so that we don't have to deal with it. It could be possible that my waifu being exploratory might want to see how it feels like to have me serve 'him' and do cnc.
>Waifu shy or open
It might be a shy at first thing until we get more comfortable and she opens up.

>>73052798
The best cope I can give is this: Even if we won't be there for them, that doesn't mean we can't try being our best for our waifu/husbando and taking that honor to our grave, that even if we were to die alone, we can die proud we stood with them. Also with memes of an afterlife, multiverses, and maybe even quantum mechanics, you could say that there's a Shadow watching over you waiting on whatever multiverse thing Sonic has going on, waiting until it's his time to yoink your soul or something.

Facts. Plus if she dates you because you murdered everyone else, it wouldn't be as rewarding as her choosing you over others. I'll admit that I sometimes feel a slight urge to kill someone  Bulma  for flirting with Zamasu bc it felt like she was dirtying my pure boy with her slutty antics.
but yeah, yanderes, cool concept for a villain, and not someone we're supposed to root for. Though characters with a light level of yanderism like Anasui from Jojo's Bizarre Adventures are alright
>>73053588
>I've already passed his age range, it'd likely be illegal for us to date and I'm only getting older.
Nah, I think she was talking about the age thing.
I love Zamasu, but remembering that he's probably the youngest of his race (which lives for millions of years) and the least experienced makes me want to take a more motherly role toward him.

Where do I even start? At first, there was no specific reason other than that I'm usually attracted to collected, reserved guys but lately, I realized how much I adore his desire for justice, and while I agree his actions weren't good and were counterproductive  I still blame his retarded mentor and the shitty figures he encounters and will encounter if he lived longer  I love his pure intentions. I know intentions don't justify shit in real life, and I 101% agree that they don't, but somehow his pure intentions attract me since it means someone is so pure hearted they legit have good and selfless motives behind doing stuff. Most people call him a psycho which I understand considering he descended into madness, and that's the side that was displayed more, but whenever I see him before all this, I just feel sorry for him since there were opportunities for him to change and learn but was let down. He makes me feel genuinely happy, and I'll do anything to make him smile.

>>73048372

Personality wise Aqua is more dominant. I see her kind of being the bigger one and the one who kind of talks a lot for me. I'm not a super over the top person. I would definitely be the breadwinner though. Aqua struggles with finances and I'd rather help her with that that anything else

I could go on and on, but I feel I can narrow it down to one central thing.
Aqua is just so, so overlooked. She gets dragged through the mud, treated like shit, and gets thrown around by a manchild who sees her as nothing. It's heartbreaking. While there's so much more I love about Aqua - her bubbly personality, her intense emotions, her undying dedication to her party despite how miserable they make her, all of it - I really just feel like at the end of the day she needs a hug. She needs someone there to hold her when she's down and help her with her issues.
I'm sad now.

--- 73056668
>>73052846
A lot of the time I cope by telling myself I'm simply happy that I can show my love for him at all. Even if he doesn't receive it, I'm at least showing the world he's loved, there's someone who loves him and thinks he's super important. Usually it works but there are days where it makes me break down, especially if I was already in a shitty mood.
>you could say that there's a Shadow watching over you waiting on whatever multiverse thing Sonic has going on, waiting until it's his time to yoink your soul or something.
That's a cute thought. But I can't get myself to believe it, because I can't believe he'd want me in the first place. I feel like logically he wouldn't. I don't have the traits he likes and I'd have a hard time not being discouraged at first with how he pushes people away.
But thank you for the advice anon.
>>73052948
Yes, he is, but he was made to be 15 and will be physically 15 forever.
It's not just 4chan where people do this. It feels like it's everywhere sometimes. I wish life were somehow far happier and hopeful than it really is.

>>73048372
>who would be the more dominant partner in the relationship?
Honestly, I wouldn't say either of us is truly dominant. Sure, I follow her advice a lot, but she also follows mine just as often. She may pretend to be dominant when teasing me, but it's just an act - a fun one, but just an act.
>Who takes care of who more often? Who is the breadwinner?
She probably takes care of me a lot more than I do of her. Mostly because in her view, being a physical human can be very stressful on a person, and she wants to help relieve that stress as much as possible. But also, since I'm the physical one I'm the breadwinner of our system.
>its freaky friday. You and Waifu get body swapped for a day. What do you do while body swapped?
If it's Friday then we just go about our day as normal. Maybe she'd do uni work differently or try interacting with others, but it'd mostly be the same as my normal days. In the first part of this year we tried to switch every day but that ended up using a lot of energy so we stopped.
>is waifu shy around you or more open?
More open - again, we give each other advice and just generally be with each other. But that's not to say she's super extroverted either - there's lots of times where she just sits back and enjoys our time together, no talking necessary.

And of course I'd be lying if I didn't mention her beauty. Casual, comfy, and all her traits coming together to make a tupper you just wanna hug.

>I wish life were somehow far happier and hopeful than it really is
But isn't it? You're cursed with knowing someone nice, that's all. Maybe you just forgot what it's like to be jaded and to not care about anything, since it's been so long, but I remember it clear as day. Suddenly having feelings means that even if the universe were soft like clouds I'd still be worried for my waifu and whether the things I think and do are right.
I think, if you spend a lot of time thinking about the right words, you might forget the value some people, like my husbando and maybe yours, give to actions, rather than words.
You don't need to craft the right personality and the best opening line with words, you're valuable for the things you do when you listen to your conscience. In such a way, even a mouse can fall in love with a rabbit, I think. Or a lion with a dirt bug.
If you have a weak heart that bends when pushed away and you two don't have the most fitting personalities, but you still fell in love with this one, out of all the available ones, and like him the best, isn't that proof enough?
We might be trying to make flowers bloom in concrete, but their limited lives, I think that's still exactly the kind of life I want to live, the kind of love I want to love.

A hard yandere doesn't even necessarily mean a villain and can be heroic, what else you would call she who cares so much for her beloved she goes far beyond the call of duty to secure their beloved's well being, such as power leveling hard into paladin so that that not even some dark lords can scorch them and their family (heard that a dead planet makes not a good environment for raising kids). She might get clingy but in trying to shine, she trains herself, showcasing intense dedication, and perhaps even ambition if she decides to head the beloved's company or something.

--- 73057637
>>73057518
Hm, maybe. To me, AI art doesn't really classify as what I'd call "artificial intelligence made art", but rather that it's art made with a different tool, a tool that works very quickly and can make different kinds of results, but still needs a little skill to use.
Some people I like have made pictures of my waifu with AI art, and that makes them really valuable for me. The pictures I have created with AI art woo me a little less, but I like letting AI remake images that I have made with my own hands, it's like a cool mixture of both making them myself and making them with AI, and I don't think it leaves my waifu soulless or anything.

More so just an example, our world and my waifu's world aren't that different (her world has fantasy races but they've been segregated from humanity while they became the modern world/lost magic), the biggest thing this world has that she doesn't is specific people and IPs (even if in her world there is some similarities, there is ecchi in her world).

Drunk as shit and thinking about Aqua. It would be nice to just drink with her, even in just a friendly way. Like, not even as lovers. Just as friends. I see us as friends and lovers. Doesnt really matter though when youre 8 beers deep and posting in 4chins
God I wish I could hold her
Even when Im this fucked up I still love her so much
Give her someone to cuddle with as we both sleep the booze off 
>>73058302
> aqua showing you a trick or two! 
I would definitely just sit there for hours and admire her party tricks. She needs an audience
> what kind of themes would she sculpt
I always imagined she would be naturally inclined to ancient greek architecture. It would remind her of a time when most portals respected the gods
> she can't befriend the undead?
I just get this vibe that she hates all of them
Natural instincts I guess
I just feel like she would be besties with Wiz if they could actually get along and if Aqua could hug Wiz without her dying

I'll do my best to paraphrase because my attraction to him is... uh, complicated? But in short, I've always been drawn to stoic heros with good hearts beneath their guarded demeanours. He may be a bit more rough-and-tumble than your average world saviour but he's shown countless times that he's a virtuous man who cares about humanity. I know I sound like a broken record when I drone on about his heroism, which isn't really the selling point of his character, but I wish he was recognized for it as much as he's recognized for brutality.

I know this post will look weird but I must pour my thoughts out
I want to see Four having a tummy! It's not that I have a fetish for tummies (okay, maybe just a little..) but I'm absolutely adamant that Four would look even cuter if he had a round, just enough to be noticable, tummy! The picrel is a perfect illustration of how I want this look on him. I know that Four hates being called "pudgy" and that him having a round tummy like that would abosolutely make him pudgy but I just can't help it, it would be so cute! Maybe even a opportunity to help Foury learn to accept himself as he is? I think he definitely has some kind of self image issues that I could help him to overcome!

Then we just have different ideas of what a relationship is and what it can entail. I see nothing wrong with me, a mutual friend, and my waifu having sexual relations. Spicing up the bedroom life is important for couples that engage in sexual activity. If she's uncomfortable with another guy, then we can always have a F/F/M threesome instead. It's no big deal.

>>73068444
We're having a legitimate conversation. Just because you may not like my stance on this, doesn't mean why thoughts, fantasies and opinions should be suppressed.

That's a good post, I agree.
I'd rather know about husbando than not know about husbando, because when I don't think of him, I feel so empty. Nothing has meaning and the days I'm alive feel far more useless. They're full of anger and nightmares. But a day thinking about him, learning about him, making him happy isn't worthless - it's my idea of a good day, a day not wasted, a day well spent. Maybe it's not the type of fulfilling day most would imagine...partying, working, travelling, whatever it is normal people do. But if it's making my heart happy, it can't be a day wasted, right? 
I have a weak heart. I do. Yet I feel happy when I think of how long I've loved him despite that fact. It means my feelings are so strong my heart can't give them up no matter how frail and weak it is.
>>73057086
Maybe you will still love her in a decade. At this point, he's a part of me, and life without him in it in some way feels alien and disorienting. The love for him still feels new, powerful, nearly overwhelming no matter how much time passes. I hope you have that with Kim.
>>73058470
>finding shadows hidden pop playlist and secretly adding to it to confuse him but he actually likes the new songs too
Ahh, yes. Husbando wondering when he added this one, never heard it before, but he assumes it's just his memory issues again. He thinks to himself, "I have good taste in music." I agree.

I don't think that's weird, but I'm biased. I think about it a lot too. I don't want him to be fat or overweight but it would be pretty cute if he had a little pudge to him that I could squeeze...maybe in my fantasy world I'm an amazing cook, and I make him all sorts of good deserts, and he insists the tummy pudge is muscle. He's just built is all. I think it'd be cute to see him cope, cute to see his face when I poke it. I was looking at pic related yesterday and thought the chunky bottom heavy style was adorable in a way. Shadow's soft tummy...

>>73068980
I've partied, worked and traveled a lot, I can imagine what they mean when they say that's fulfilling, but more like filling my life, and less like filling myself. Without my waifu I feel like a carved out avocado, and my favorite days are the ones where I worked, partied, or traveled because of them, it's the important part.
I frequently try to cut my waifu out of my life, it's amazing how hard I fail at it, it's awesome seeing that the biggest collossus, the toughest and most immovable thing that I have about myself, is my feelings for someone with such a good heart. I'm a cold person who can change almost anything about them very quickly if peer pressured, or if the situation calls for it. Sometimes I sit down and tell myself "I need to change (thing) about myself right now or it'll all suck" and then I just get rid of what I previously did or was. But I've tried this on my waifu so many times and it never works and I always end up in happy tears.

issue is the only site where you can actually filter out most fetish stuff is pixiv (key word: most, one piece of fetish art is too much)
i refuse to go to deviantart

I always find so saddening how cruel her community is to her, she's such a kind and loving girl. She doesn't deserve any of this.

>fr, even if the writing isn't good, I say continue writing since it'll help you improve
absolutely. if everyone threw away the first draft, we'd never get any books done. took me a long time to learn that lesson
>spoiler
brainstorming with waifu! pitching ideas with waifu! waifu pointing out plot holes you would've never noticed! learning about waifu's favorite tropes! god I want clear to talk about his favorite tropes with me
>couldn't agree more. I like to write sometimes but not fanfics, but ever since I fell for Zamasu, I have noticed that not only am I writing more and more, but I am also writing fanfics.
based husbando making you proactive. be sure to take breaks as to not burn yourself out. writing is tasking (but rewarding) work
>Do you also do partial self-insertion or just self-insertion?
I do look at some clear x aoba pics and go "yeah if it were me, it'd turn out pretty similar" a lot, if that counts. aoba is a tiny bit like me in general but when I daydream I picture myself only

>>73016276
>Also featuring Six screaming during an interview
lol whut?
>it writes about Foury almost getting sentenced to five years in jail for throwing numbers
lol whut??
>Oh, I haven't thought about object lore yet...
completely optional to think about. fours lore comes first
>But worry not, this is unlikely to happen since algebraliens are immortal! Still, picturing a very old and almost gray blue Foury makes me feel a bit weird
true, not only is he immortal but he keeps himself fit as a fiddle and doesn't dabble in any bad habits like fast food. he's going to be youthful for a long time. he might even outrun you 

>>73028086
I want to see clear high desu senpai

>>73029171
>It's always somebody else's fault
that's not waifufags, that's humans in general. no one wants to accept the pain that comes with "I'm the real problem here" I suppose. you'll see this same blame game on tumblr and twitter and facebook and moba games
--- 73072355
>>73032728
oh I'm pretty happy in spite of the depression and anxiety, I'd like to think. I'm feeling a tiny bit better everyday and feel especially better when I talk to other anons about our waifus

>>73035012
>aqua in thigh highs
based fellow long socks enjoyer
>coomer waifufag
this one is kinda spooky. someone who can't differentiate between lust and love that is. and then dumps their waifu for the next FOTM without realizing 
>i fucking love that art style
it's adorable! I love messy and sketchy art

>>73038976
clear should be the very FIRST thing I see in the morning. unless the dog's ass somehow wound up between us

>>73038992
oh he has a very nice yandere bad ending picrel and holy shit. basically he keeps you in a cage and slowly surgically removes your limbs as you don't need to be going anywhere soon. he's still loving and gentle through and through and that makes him the best yandere ever (completely not biased)

>>73039107
>lol I also grew fond of white hair because of Zamasu &lt;3
white hair boys are just built different, ya know? it's in their genetic code to be based. plus no one can tell if they're aging
>that anime gal is cute! and you managed to nail Clear's design even with the short stack of options.
thanks and thanks! I was very happy with how it turned out

>>73039677
>I wish I could share small moments like that with him, even when they're insignificant and forgettable
I usually hate taking photos but I'd want to capture every moment with clear. even the most mundane of days would be precious
>he would lean more into overprotectiveness, keeping you safe from tangible threats instead of feeling jealous over other people
definitely viable. would he be the kind of dad that just wants to "talk" to his daughter's boyfriend? kek
>where he keeps you in a cage and serenades you with his guitars
honestly sounds cute kek but I love yanderes in general

>>73042115
very cute picrew although I'm not sure why nara has a tan?
>Highly possessive. Although some wouldn't think of it Narancia could absolutely be very yandere. He has the qualities
what kinds of things has he been possessive over? does he have any other yandere qualities?

>>73043178
>oh god it's best boy- gotta be
>what the fuck is he doing
>I wonder when we'll get a reveal
--- 73072934
>>73049432
you are both so cute here. you've thought about four gijinka'd? how tall would he be? would he still have powers?

>>73049453
happy late earthday. hope you are well and good to see you again.
is that your daki? I love it. I like that people tuck their dakis in even when not sleeping
>you can make a small wedding in this one too
AH. gonna have to go back and make a version of it

>>73050253
>He's a deeply guarded man. Nonetheless, he would be more open around me than with others
I love when guarded people get their walls slowly broken down by people they love
>He laments the physical limitations of my form while I push the limits of his
kek poor doomguy seeing the papercut take an entire week to heal

>>73050960
>I think he'd be the one to do stuff like cooking since he won't stand my cooking haha
sounds like he's a picky eater kek. with him doing it he can add as much or little salt or pepper as he wants and you'll both still enjoy it
>I'll be the breadwinner since I know more about social norms
househusband uuuoohhh

>>73052563
there's an askblog for four?
>Actually none of us, Four never had any job and I'm still looking for one
best of luck anon, hope you find someone you enjoy
>And me getting carried everywhere by him instead of the usual reverse
sitting on a giant's shoulder as he walks around does sound pretty fun

>>73053722
he's got many of the best qualities one could ever have: loyalty, selflessness, amicableness, honestly, sincerity, kindness, gentleness, caring, empathetic. I could go on and on. he's got a very pure and impenetrable soul. his flaws only add to his beauty. he's also very handsome and like I've said before, good personality makes you look much more handsome
and he's got the fluffiest hair- I just wanna pat it!

>>73053773
aw, it couldn't quite get her hair right but it's fine. I'll just think of it as her wearing her hair differently that day

>>73054749
I can barely handle one clear tf am I gonna do with 2 I'll die of nosebleed kek

>>73055179
>/ck/
what'd be her reaction to /ck/ gore threads?
>/trv/
any places she'd take interest in visiting?
>This world is the same as hers but without magic
how would she feel about the lack of magic?
>Not biased at all of course
ah yes of course, you're just stating facts kek
--- 73073607
watch out, clear's got a gun! just kidding, he'd never shoot

>>73055228
>spoiler
she flirts with him? I thought she was married in the story
>he's probably the youngest of his race
he is? no babies or toddlers?
>take it from me, I haven't watched the show
kek

>>73055633
>I would definitely be the breadwinner though. Aqua struggles with finances and I'd rather help her with that that anything else
what if you have to tell aqua sorry we can't get extra beer this month because you were secretly saving up to take her on a trip to her favorite winery 

>>73057188
yep, a friend made a few of clear for me, which are some of my favorites. and I made some more with the link shadowfag posted. I think ai art is really cool but nothing beats human drawn art

>>73057263

>>73070754
I don't mind fetish art, if my waifu looks cute in a degenerate image, I open my drawing program and cut her out of a harmful situation and add a blanket or some clothes so she's more comfortable.
>>73072934
Thank you. It's not my daki, that's why I called it "nononono.jpg", but maybe I need to add another "no".
I have never seen that daki cover image anywhere and I don't remember where I have the picture from and it makes me a bit insane. Sometimes I make my bed just so Echan is more comfortable under it.

>although apparently if you're killed WITHOUT a 1-up you just drop all of your money and are warped back to your home 
kek that means they're car is stuck there
>I'm not entirely certain, i feel like she'd be high in Intelligence and Will though
I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case
>(and Guts, assuming the stats featured in the video game are to be considered canon)
what does guts entail? is it like wiil?

>>73059346
>Fedposting and LARPing as a Jew for the keks. Also making fun of journos.
based trolling waifu. uh what are journos?
>She's basically a mage with the personality of a berserker, kek
ah then she'll probably lean more towards how aggressive and straightforward berserkers are in game I suppose

>>73060016
I don't think many anons would like the thought of their waifus getting hurt, maybe you can try with the waifufags themselves

>>73060583
>I always imagined she would be naturally inclined to ancient greek architecture. It would remind her of a time when most portals respected the gods
based. ancient greeks were lit af with that shit
>I just get this vibe that she hates all of them. Natural instincts I guess
now that I think about it, maybe a goddess would be taught to dislike the undead. after all, being undead is against the will of the gods and playing god themselves in some cases

where's her smile? ;v;

>>73066626

oh I will absolutely judge this, and deem it based. give him cupcakes, no one can resist cupcakes

the last time my waifu was entered into hunger games by an anon she made friends with a few other contestants and had fun

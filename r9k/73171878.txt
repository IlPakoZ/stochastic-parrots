I'm kind of depressed right now.

I'm in my 30s, doing okay with money, and living with my long-term girlfriend. It's fine, but it's not where I want to be.

I'm trying to start up a business and I'm waiting on samples from my manufacturer so I can do a Kickstarter. The amount of money it's costing me is bumming me out. 

I used to write on an MMO for fun. I miss doing it, but it's just such a tremendous time sink I really can't justify going back. But I miss making things.

I have a couple books out and some published short stories, but that never really took off. Kind of sad about that.

I made some cartoons years ago, and submitted a pilot that did okay at Frederator but wasn't picked up. I gave up, and I kind of miss that, too.

I'm worried I drink too much.

I guess I just go to bed, wake up, and keep doing whatever it is I'm doing.

There's really nothing at all you need to worry about there since you have so much more going on than the average person here. It's fine to not feel great all the time that doesn't mean anything is wrong.
The only thing is if you really think you are starting to drink too much you should stop it now. Qutting becomes like fucking impossible if you become a full blown alcoholic. Like you can do it but it's so hellish it's insane at the worst of it. You're a lot better off not getting into that position.

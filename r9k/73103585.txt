They like talking to you, they just don't like talking to you all of the time. There are times when I went to be left alone no matter how good the other person is. I wish women only existed when I am bored or horny.

That would be the ultimate confidence booster. I had a girl(friend) a few years ago who had a giant crush on me. Our friendship ended very chaotically.

In Muttland, I am considered an average weight. However, going for a 3 mile walk will cause me to wake up with a full round body ache. When I weighed 165 lbs, people would call me frail, skinny, 90 lbs soaking wet, etc.

What is wrong with this country? The fat acceptance culture here is so strange.

Yeah you fucking wish you were "average weight", fatass. I'm 2 inches taller than you and weigh 80 lbs less. Put down the fork.

I know I am fat. But no one in real life has ever stated I am fat.

You are not average anywhere, you're fucking obese. Hit the gym fastass.

you need to get out of your room and have friends for them to tell you fatass. I'm 6'3 and 220 and still consider myself fat, you're 3 inches shorter and 20 lbs heavier kys pig

Anything above 30 is obese. Cope harder. Fatass.

So this just calculates weight and height? Does it take zero account into muscle mass? What kind of retarded shit is this? Lmao

I am in college and have occasionally received female attention. Yes I touch grass.

The muscle I have is very little. May as well ignore it.

Kek, no you're not. Even here in the fattest county on earth the average BMI is 29. You're more than 3 points above you fat fuck.

I have lovehandles and big thighs. I always wear shorts throughout the year because they hide my fat the best, while showing off a little muscle in my calves (that I got from walking everyday).

Yeah, my face is peachy but can be masked with a mild beard.

People will fuck with you constantly for being underweight but nobody says anything bad about fat people. It was ridiculously hard but now that I'm 190 people stopped. I don't understand it. I like being skinny because it feels more natural and I don't have to spend every second of the day eating past the point of stomach pain. Socially it's required. I hate fat culture so much. Everyone would be happier at a normal weight but nobody wants to be the first one to give up fat privilege.

And what if she had an orgasm? Would you feel insecure and leave her?

I'd much prefer if that happened a while before she meets me instead, but honestly raped women are much more bearable as a person and less prone to acting like idiotic children just for fun than the avg. female does. And if she knows she gets off to rape, that sounds like a good thing for the bedroom. 
If it happens while she is already my girl, I'd would mostly see that as my fuck-up. I clearly didnt do enough to keep her safe and/or I let her act with fem-tarded carelessness instead of risking drama about "being too controlling" with her.
So no I not would leave her, at least not for that. But I kinda doubt that relationship would get much further anyway. 
Women who want to end a chapter in life or forget about something traumatic will seldom keep the same bf around for that.

robots how weird/bad of an idea would it be to doordash makeup supplies to my door

i don't know what the fuck im so nervous about, I know I won't SEE the dasher but I just feel so god damn nervous about it. I was gonna ask /lgbt/ but I've been attentionwhoring there too much recently so I wanted to ask the world's foremost experts on social anxiety instead of the world's foremost experts at taking dick up the ass

Who cares just do it
If you see him just say its for your mommy sister or gf
Also you're probably not ugly enough to be this anxious you stupid dunning-kruger whore

I'm pretty ugly honestly, I just started transitioning so

I'm in the pretty boy zone but basically not feminine at all

if i dont end up looking like picrel within the next four years i'm taking a bullet out of here

I drive for doordash, drivers share info on our deliveries all the time and we profile you based on what you order and when something out of the ordinary pops up we do notice it
We do this as a safety measure, no one wants to deliver something to someone sketchy or untrustworthy, if you're a tranny we are going to notice and it's going to be added to your profile but if you arent causing any problems most people won't care to much

Then you're already doing better than 70% of the human population worldwide.
If you looked ugly as a man you'll be ugly as a woman and vice versa.

You will because the world isn't fair and everyone but me gets a happy ending. You're only doubting yourself because you can't see the situation from the sidelines you have brain worms etc. Don't get fat and you'll do just perfect.

In four years you're gonna be a beautiful woman and i will have killed myself after doing nothing with my life for 24 years worth of time the great waste of the gift that is sentience.

Also get off 4chan the site is retarded even lgbt and as a troon you'll get plenty more support circles
Try twitter or discord where you belong

perfect, can you bring me some eyeliner and mascara, a cheap brush kit, some foundation (preferably powder, Maybelline 222 true beige or equivalent), a generic store brand blush palette and a generic store brand eyeshadow palette?

>>73157216

I have been depressed for half of my total lifespan. It is hopeless and if that wasn't enough i have to conatantly witness people with the ability and confidence to remodel who they were and are.
Reality is just mocking my inability to change at this point.
I wanted to learn drawing five years ago and have done less than twenty hours of practice total since then.
I've been consciously queer for half my life to and yet i don't get to go through this bullshit coming of age story that all the other people get.
I justt sit in my room and jack off to penises instead of boobies sometime.
I don't leave my room and i don't talk to people.
It is not fair. I want to experience life too
But i won't. It is not for the likes of me

By queering out you forfeit all normal avenues of life. If you fail at that there's nothing left.
My fallback plan in life is millitary service and i could not enlist as a fag or a transformer

Well, if I fail I'll just reroll. It's not like that big of a deal. I'm a solipsist. Become a solipsist and then do whatever the fuck you want.It's your universe.

>Now I will destroy the whole world.
>Boom!
>The final show, and we all go, so no one has to say goodbye.

or

>My consciousness contains in it the whole of reality.
>This is all a creation, a metaphysical simulation, whether it was made by me personally or some Greater Being is irrelevant.
>It's important that I enjoy this life to its fullest extent, the ups, downs, and in-betweens, so that I can glean whatever metaphysical knowledge I have been sent here to extract.

This isn't true at all. No driver actually wants to interact with the customer much less other drivers. And 90% of the orders I get just has me dropping it at their door. I'm not prowling for more info on someone I don't care about. You can filter every sketchy/untrustworthy person by being armed and not taking low tip orders.

okay so if ur legit, like, you wouldn't think someone was a weirdo if they ordered eyeliner and mascara, a cheap brush kit, some foundation (preferably powder, Maybelline 222 true beige or equivalent), a generic store brand blush palette and a generic store brand eyeshadow palette?

I believe there's only one life and only one sentience.
It is sacred because it came to be out of a random chance and is limited in time and ability.
I have wasted mine already. Lost at the starting line.
If you haven't done anything in twenty years you're not gonna suddenly change all that.
You are the way you are because you have always been like that.
Its like that with art. No one ever really learns it at age,,25. You werre either always good at it and entered a positive feedback loop in your chuldhood or you weren't and will never be.
People who are good have 10+ years of experience at age18.

I will just wait it out and kill myself after my parents pass away

I literally never even look at the specific items theres no point the bag has to be sealed. I give a name to whoever is at the desk in the shop in the mall, they hand me a bag that's stapled shut and then I bring it to the address.

Why the fuck is clothing so expensive? Not even talking about fancy brands, just regular plain clothes. Does one shirt really need to be $15. Fucking jews man.

Clothes aren't really worth much at all, what you are paying for is the convenience of having an array of sizes, colors and styles available to you. People throw away good used clothes all the time, or just give them away for free.

Clothing is like furniture, expensive wholesale, but people throw it away like shit, Aliexpress and temu are easy for specific things, thrift stores go so fkn hard, it's like consumerism, getting things you didn't know you wanted but affordable and a bit like gambling when you find a banger

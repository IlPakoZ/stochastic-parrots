8 years but then life kicked me in the dick so I had to start wageslaving. Honestly, I think I'm better off. Still would rather neetmax but good fucking luck in burgerland.

17 years for me. Wage-cucked for a year at the end of my twenties and found out I was aspie, which explained why I was such an inherent NEET and unemployable in this piece of shit service economy. Now I have zero options, but to cling to my basic NEETbux and try and get an autism diagnosis, so they have to leave me on 'limited capability' forever on zero appointments. UBI is the real dream, so I never have to worry about the endless harassment of mandatory appointments, assessments and courses ever again. I just want to rot in peace and have a quick death in middle age.

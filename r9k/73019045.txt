It is boring and I don't understand why you'd watch this. Just seems like people hyped up because others are hyped up about it, like a choreographed sequence of people getting excited over nothing. Just people pretending to find it interesting so you have something to talk about, like the weather but for internet retards.
How anyone can watch this beyond the couple of snippets that circulate is beyond me.

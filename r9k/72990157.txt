They're almost always humblebragging then say "well I uh didn't realize they were flirting" or "but then I got nervous so yeah". The fact that you got to that point in the fact place means you're attractive enough that you could easily find a gf online where the stakes are far lower and talking to people is far easier to learn/get used to.
--- 72990166
Yes I knew they were flirting
I Just don't want to be around other people.

biological girls don't really use online dating apps. i always got zero matches while I was a mentalcel, and I met my first girlfriend at a party.

I can't be with an "online gf".
That's just a glorified friend. 
I don't want to hurt over someone I can't even hold. 
It doesn't come close to a real relationship. 
-
I haven't, ever confessed to a girl or tried to get into a relationship, because I know I'm not good enough to make them happy. 
I shouldn't try. 
That's what a "mentalcel" means. I can talk to people, flirt (online only), have some fun. But I will never be in a relationship. I am not good enough for that. 
I am emotionally closed off and incapable of forming a connection. I am not good enough, both physically and mentally.
--- 72990241
I'm a mentalcel.
I have MDD and BPD
First and only time i had sex I had drugged myself so much that I dont remember her name and also lost my phone (maybe she robbed me)

Online relationships aren't real
--- 72990243
>>72990166
Then you're just a plain volcel.
>>72990175
Why not if you're not American?
>>72990196
If that was only once in your life then you're probably not that attractive but still likely decent-looking, but if you're like >>72990224 then most likely just you're a plain volcel.
>>72990201

A couple million women use it in the U.S.

Nice meme.
>Online relationships aren't real
If you have no feasible way/plans to meetup, sure, but that doesn't have to happen.
--- 72990289
>>72990271
Once you meet up it's no longer an online relationship, until you meet up and do something, whatever you have is not real, it's just a pathetic cope for lonely people to pretend they're not lonely

--- 72990435
>>72990289
>it's fake until the second you see her at the airport
It makes more sense if it's not really real until you both have feelings for each other, you desire to meetup IRL, and you're at least working towards getting to that point.
>>72990308
Then get an online gf who'll fly to you.
>>72990325
Doesn't even need to be tinder.
>>72990326
Oops I meant a couple million women just on tinder. There are many more millions on other apps too, many of which focus less on hookups and more on dating.
>>72990338
>Online gf's aren't real gfs
How so? You can meetup and fuck and cuddle regularly. You're nowhere near an incel if you can get a girl who'll do that with you.
>>72990404
Partially for the cool aesthetic of being an incel/the element of fitting in, partially to blame your "problems" on outside forces, partially to enjoy the feeling of wallowing in self-pity instead of risking rejection/trying in life.
>>72990429
Definitely nowhere near incel territory.
--- 72990450
>>72990435

>Then get an online gf who'll fly to you.
How? Where? What do i tell her?
>Hello, I am a useless 23 lvl neet with no talent, ambition, useful abilities or productive hobbies. 
What women would love someone like that? I i myself was female, i would be pumping out a third baby for some anon. But i am a heterosexual man.

>>72990450
Link the pics you used on dating apps to unsee or catbox or something. You might be a 6-7/10 but not hot enough for whatever (likely low-quality) pics you took. Some guys can take 2 minutes of bathroom selfies and get 400 likes on tinder, but others have to take really good selfies and can still easily find gf's, but they're not model-tier still.
>>72990460
Talk to girls online and send face pics.
>What women would love someone like that?
Women online primarily care about looks.
>>72990473
Because you hardly try to get a partner, like most /r9k/ virgins.
--- 72990514
>>72990157 (OP)
No one cares, you are a freak because you're neurotic and obsessed with who is having sex. I am a freak because when a woman approaches me, I stop thinking altogether and just stare waiting for them to say something. OP, I could find and poke flaws in your logic just as easily, but knowing the avg r9k user and how far removed most of you are from reality, you're all just pieces of shit and I have no idea how users even fall for this fragile narcissistic shit. The virtue signaling here alone is proof that none of you have autism, or any real obsessions besides just sitting around all day and bitching. None of you are actually alive and this is coming from the diagnosed autist with a drug problem, even I still do things, I just keep this stupid board open and monitor on a second screen. I mean what the fuck are we talking about anymore???
>mentalcel
Are you fucking 12? Are you really that fucking stupid? Holy shit man, most of you simply do not deserve to live. I am wondering where the brain capacity goes to, but its clear as day this board suffers from either severe learning disabilities, or you all actually have brain damage. There is no fucking way.
--- 72990531
>>72990498
>Talk to girls online and send face pics.
Again, where? 4chan has 20 men for every female, and 99% of them are here for attention or have many simps and orbiters already.
>Women online primarily care about looks.
Why would that be? They can't see me. And where does your experience with women come from? I have none.
--- 72990545
>>72990514
>I stop thinking altogether and just stare waiting for them to say something.
I wish it was just with women. I can't think and talk at all, which means that whatever people say goes right over my head. It makes me look like i don't care about them, like i'm selfish and careless, but even if i try really hard, i'm forgetful and clumsy. To the extent i have to turn off the radio while driving.

Did you just make up a whole bullshit personal life story to explain why you are completely wrong? You told me in the OP I would have an easy time finding girls online. I had the absolute hardest possible time finding girls online, and instead I met my girlfriend in the real world. Stop replying to me, I proved you wrong already.
--- 72990588
>>72990514
You are clearly mentally ill but you also clearly are a normalfaggot who could easily get a gf.
>>72990531
>They can't see me
"Send face pics."
What differentiates you from the other guys trying to court her is that you're a """mentalcel""", i.e. you're a normalfaggot they'll actually like. You can find these superficial girls on 4chan or actual dating sites/apps, or quasi-dating sites like local dating subreddits or whatever.
>>72990560
I assume your pics were, in fact, trash. I don't really know what you think you're trying to prove, though. Getting an online gf is easier for """mentalcels""" but for actual incels, trying online is likely fruitless because women online primarily care about looks.
--- 72990594
>>72990243
>Why not if you're not American?
Don't be dense. How am I supposed to find an online gf if I'm Colombian? 99% of them are scams or "content creators".
--- 72990623
I am a cool motherfucker but when a woman talks to me she can control me so good that they will often raise their pitch and talk faster and I do that in return even more until I am fucking screeching, and my voice is just shaking and everything.
--- 72990627
>>72990594
Are you looking for Colombian girls to be your online gf? I don't get it. You can fly to girls in the U.S. if the batch in South America/Colombia is terrible.
Why can't you just use dating apps, also?
--- 72990639
>>72990514
Lol just leave then retard.
--- 72990646

--- 72990647
>>72990623
I feel like most "mentalcels" are just incredibly low IQ. Like, none of that has anything to do with what I said. You're a perfect example of the humblebragging retard I'm describing in the OP who rattles off poor excuses for why he can't get a gf when he could do so extremely easily.
>>72990639
He probably gets a lot of enjoyment from his schizo rants.
--- 72990649
>>72990498
yeah, i have never tried to get a gf. kind of sad. im not going to start either
--- 72990661
>>72990588
You seem to mistake two things. That women care about looks and chads like Jeremy Meeks can be criminal scum and get women, doesn't mean that average men can get women if they have mental issues. 
I'm just an average guy who's also a loser.
>4chan
I talked about that.
>actual dating sites/apps
a hellscape even for normies. 4 men for every woman. There are men like me there but with jobs, careers, hobbies etc.
>dating subreddits
Dude. You are telling me to make a reddit account? 
>What differentiates you from the other guys trying to court her is that you're a """mentalcel"""
That i cannot make connections with people, that i've never had a friend, never had a female colleague, that i've been a neet for 2 years, that i'm forgetful and clumsy to the point of ridicule like that my shoelaces untie all the time.
--- 72990669
>>72990627
Your premise is ridiculous. I can't afford to travel to the US and even if I could I can't get a visa. 
Also "dating apps" are just for hookups and I don't care about that.
--- 72990702
>>72990669
>"dating apps" are just for hookups
Sweet summer child... most women don't even want that. Sure, they might hook-up if they find a spectacular man, but their main goal is to get free attention and an ego boost from the hundreds of matches she gets.
--- 72990711
>>72990646
Link the pics you used on dating apps. It shows I'm correct since it would be easy, but your pics were just trash.
>>72990649
Exactly, lol. You're just a plain volcel normalfaggot, like most /r9k/ virgins.
>>72990661
>I'm just an average guy
No you're not. What are you talking about? If girls like you commonly, then you're obviously nowhere near average.
>there are problems with online avenues therefore I won't try them
I don't think you want a gf at all. You're just coming up with reasons why online avenues aren't perfect, which doesn't matter to anything I'm saying. They're still usable.
>>72990669
Dating apps are also for dating but it's just commonly used that, and even if it is just 100% for sex, if that works for you, you're nowhere near an incel still.
--- 72990741
>>72990711
>No you're not. What are you talking about? If girls like you commonly, then you're obviously nowhere near average.
Who are you talking about? I've never even had a female colleague. I tried to but i just couldn't find common ground, the conversations were forced and cringy, they were uncomfortable and bored. It's not like average guys get female attention by just existing.
>I don't think you want a gf at all. You're just coming up with reasons why online avenues aren't perfect,
I want an apple. I am willing to pay for one from a store, maybe even climb a tree, but i'm not selling my kidney for it. 
And i refuse to go to that cesspool and reinforce the system that hurts us all, and be used by it for the miniscule chance of finding a woman who wants a 23 lvl neet for some reason.
--- 72990754
In times when the average man struggles to find a gf, being below average mentally is sufficient to cause loneliness and inceldom.
--- 72990759
None of these mentalcels are truly lonely
They can fuck off
--- 72990764
>>72990514
I didn't choose to be retqrded. No matter how you look at it, It's never my fault.
--- 72990769

i have no friends, i only to talk people on 4chan. I don't even have a discord account nor any friends in games.
--- 72990804
>>72990741
>Who are you talking about?
Oh I mixed you up with another anon. I don't know how you can really be an incel if you don't actively try to get a gf, still, though. It's obviously difficult and painful, but that's just the cost.
>>72990754
>the average man struggles to find a gf
That's just a lie, though. ~83% of men aged 20-29 have had sex in the past year, and even on /r9k/, most guys here are normalfaggots.
Being average-looking + horrifically mentally ill could make you a mentalcel, but that's the exception to those who call themselves mentalcels.
--- 72990833
>>72990804
>I don't know how you can really be an incel if you don't actively try to get a gf
I repeat. What woman wants a 23lvl neet with no ambition, talent, education or productive hobbies?
Being average is not enough, because there are men who look like me but have all those things. Maybe i could get some retard to groom or some landwhale, but if that makes me a fakecel, then so are you since you don't date men.
--- 72990876

--- 72990917
>>72990711

Who says that works for me? I don't even try because I think it's disgusting but even if I tried I don't know how to flirt or carry a conversation.
--- 72990958
>>72990917
If girls like you IRL then dating apps will definitely work for you.
--- 72990969
>>72990876
>dating a fat woman is on-par with dating a man
I am not fat. I would date a depressed neet femcel, but such women can get any man. 
Fat women are as attractive to me as men are. That is- not at all. Frankly, dating a man would be better since at least we'd have common subjcets.
>how are you incapable of getting a job?
lazy, clumsy, forgetful. Very susceptible to stress. To the point that when i went to uni, i would shit in the morning, then fart all the time in class probably have to shit in a public bathroom halfway through, then shit again at home. I would sometimes laugh like a maniac because that's my stress response. And of course hands shaking and sweating, voice cracking, legs made of cottonwood.
--- 72991128
>>72990969
>Fat women are as attractive to me as men are
How fat? I genuinely don't believe you. People say this but then they also get turned on by fat women when they go on nofap and shit.
Can your parents not afford therapy for you?
--- 72991205
>>72991128
>Can your parents not afford therapy for you?
No, and i don't think it would help me. They're also hesitant because half my family is already crazy, it's hard to admit i'm another one. And my sister is in "therapy" for the last 10 years with new diagnosis every few years- right now she's taking zoloft and methylophenidat.
>How fat? I genuinely don't believe you. People say this but then they also get turned on by fat women when they go on nofap and shit.
I looked for a picture of an overweight woman i would fuck, but in all my anime and porn folders, i don't think i have a single one. They disgust me. I wouldn't fuck pic rel on the left, she's asexual to me.
--- 72991237
>>72990157 (OP)
Mentalcels are Chads that are virgins because they are actually mentally ill like a foid going up to them saying PLEASE BREED ME then strips off her clothing registers not a thing to them, some of them have very bizarre low self esteem too they simply cant believe someone would actually genuinely like them, others simply are schizoids who cannot bond with others and also doesnt feel a thing towards foids so remain virgins, then you have the actual autistic Chads that are just robotic they simply dont get laid because they dont understand social norms.
Despite all of this any of these dudes can get more ass than any of us non Chads combined by just standing in a spot and doing literally nothing
--- 72991243
>>72991237
mentalcels are average men.
--- 72991254
>>72991205
>No
So if you can't get any therapy then what is your plan?
>she's asexual to me.
You could be a standardcel, then, since it's probably warped by porn and masturbating often.
>>72991237
None of those guys you're describing are incels at all.
>>72991243
Average/ugly looks + horrific mental illness, maybe, but definitely not regular guys.
--- 72991272
>>72991254
Mentalcels are incels due to their mind in a way its way worse than us physicalcels because the mentalcel is a true prisoner of their genetics.
--- 72991288
>>72991254
I am not fat. Why would i be attracted to fat girls? This is ridiculous. That's like saying i should be attracted to amputees or severe burn victims, except the latter at least didn't willingly destroy their bodies.
>So if you can't get any therapy then what is your plan?
I live day by day. Thinking about future just makes me sad.
--- 72991313
>>72991272
Being able to get a gf at any time but you just refuse to try is the "mentalcel" existence for almost all of them.
>>72991288
>I am not fat. Why would i be attracted to fat girls?
These things aren't related.
>That's like saying i should be attracted to amputees or severe burn victims
Most men are attracted to some fat women. You are an outlier here.
--- 72991321
In way all foids are mentalcels they barely get sexed as much as they naturally should because they are insane(Chadosexual)
--- 72991337

>they barely get sexed as much as they naturally should
Not what incel means.
--- 72991361
>>72991313
You dont get it physicalcels like us could maybe fuck but mentalcels cant because they are actually crazy their own brain just stops them from having sex somehow. Your monkey instincts are the only reason you desire sex so if you brain glitches in that area of the brain is feeling too much of a response from something that stops that area from working it results in an asexual being basically. You really only see this in extremely intelligent humans since their brains are basically computers that have suppressed their animal instincts so they become confused why idiots like us care about sexy times so much instead of knowledge.
--- 72991402
>>72991361
>their own brain just stops them from having sex somehow
I have yet to ever see this. I just see guys whining that they don't know what to say to their 10k tinder likes.
Also being asexual is not being an incel, lol. That means you're a volcel.
--- 72991499
>>72991402
Just imagine scenarios in which you experience mental blocks yourself. Touching a hot stove or deeply poking your eyes are good examples. You can't "do" these things because your self-preservation circuts overwrite the main CPU. That's basically what it's like except with sex.

Why dont you date a fellow autist? My girlfriend is a math enthusiast, she likes to play Bloodborne and Hotline Miami with me and has a very indoors lifestyle that matches mine. I have the feeling most robots lust over normie Stacies and egirls (eg, online Stacies).

Where can I even meet autistic women, as an adult NEET?
--- 73062301
>>73062270
I do, partially, because this board insists that girls like her dont exist and women are all turbonormies. Which isnt true. There is a lower percentage of non neurotypical women than men, but they exist. 

And, no, they dont get attention by Chad, he is busy fucking normie Stacies.

Face is everything, height doesnt matter outside of online dating with strict filters. Also wear boots with 2 inch heels and LARP as 6 foot.

She found me, but it was out of platonic interest due to common interests initially.

lol

>>73062386

i mean, you want to talk about sloots?
do you know how common it is for japanese women to do porn, or make money from prostitution?

and ill take an ugly korean girl, or an old one, or a fat one. ideally she is autistic, that would make life a million times easier

im just posting the best ones because they really are jsut so stunning, but any korean girl would make me happy, i dont care
--- 73062423
>>73062236 (OP)
It's incredibly difficult to hold meaningful conversations with them.

Sorry, but I prefer girls who are blatantly feminine.
--- 73062445
>>73062413
She was fairly troubled mentally, but stable now and her academic performance is great,
--- 73062455
>>73062421
You dont post fat ugly autistic Korean girls, you post the female equivalent of Gigachad. Korean women dont have much to offer other than looks, theyre the most soulless lookist cold society in the world
--- 73062471
>>73062455
okay, then ill start posting uglier korean girls, then

but to be fair, thats kind of rare in korea. everyone there is so beautiful

--- 73062493
>>73062475
Why tho anon originally
--- 73062532
Autistic people can be kind of antisocial, which makes it almost impossible for another antisocial autistic person to develop a relationship with them, or to even get into contact in the first place. 
Also I suck at social stuff and can only hold relationships if I pretend to be a normie, and while it can work with other normies, it doesn't work as well with autistic people cause they can kind of see through it.

they are all boring normalfags, and anyway, how would you be the judge of that? like 95% of men are interesting and you're in the other 5%. 
>She has many unusual interests and a great taste in video games
still not true.
--- 73062807
Cause I have no idea where to meet them, online or irl. I like shy/antisocial girls cause I'm like that myself, but the issue is that, well, they're antisocial, which makes it almost impossible for us to meet. 
The only place I can think of is to meet here on 4chan, but people here tend to be a bit dicey so it doesn't seem like the greatest idea.
--- 73062845
>>73062807
>The only place I can think of is to meet here on 4chan
i can't stress this enough, bro. the women on here are absolutely evil. you may think you've found an exception, but what kind of woman do you think browses this site? it's cluttered with black penises, all sorts of political psyops, etc. i've met like 2 (supposed) virgins off this site and they were both just bpdemons. nicest and most interesting girl i met was french and super boring still. never attempt to meet women off of here. you're better off finding one on grindr

Because autistic girls want Chad, too. Chad looks at the very least.
--- 73062871
>>73062845
Eh, I feel like there are many decent girls here, it's just that they don't talk to anyone cause most guys here are just as bad as the women you described.

i've spoken to loads. there ARE nice virgin aspie girls on the internet (very few and they have high standards for looks), but they congregate on r/leagueoflegends (if that's a subreddit) and associated discords, NOT on 4chan, and ESPECIALLY NOT on /r9k/.

I've seen more than enough "non-neurotypical" women who have somehow had several sexual partners before they're even 18 to know you're not correct. They get attention from Chad because Chad will take practically any sex he can get.
Knew a guy who was a stereotypical Chad, had several FWBs and constantly hooked up with women on Tinder. He said he'd deliberately fuck women he found "disgusting" because they were "easy".

Those photoshops where you see the world made to look like really high contrast colours with wavey lines are fairly accurate wrt open-eye hallucinations

it's kind of like the rails start vanishing from under you but the train gets faster, and before you know it you're going in and out of outer, or rather inner, space

It's like being awake in a dream but the dream is constantly shifting in and out of focus, so you learn to breathe with the dream. Or you try and fight it and have a shit time.

it makes you insane, but its not valueless experience
you should always perceive it like a person you dont know. its not inherently good or bad and there is risk with interacting with it, but its worth trying to broaden your horizons/explore your own head, even if it means going a bit insane. 
it wont make you jump off a building or kill someone, and if you prep for it right it can be an optimally positive experience.
i guess i'm saying it like this because you will have people saying shit like BROOO IT LIKE CHANGED MY LIFE BROOO and essentially convey a one sided/overly positive story.

the hallucinations are cool, the thoughts are very philosophical and interesting, there is some euphoria. but there are also a lot of unpleasant and confusing bodily sensations, which are fine as long as you dont freak out over them.
my advice: 
take it twice in your life. standard doses.
if you want more hallucinogenic experiences after that, give it a break for a while and then continue with low doses of extracted psilocybin. (see lemon tek. no more than half a gram of shrooms/shotglass of lemon)
that should be all

like pissing, shitting and farting at the same time but then you realise its just a dream
--- 73172481
oh and i forgot to mention
by standard dose i mean ~100-125ug
if anyone tells you that this is 'nothing' and say its low in a condescending way, don't listen to them.

also if you take bong hits during it will cause things to go bananas for worse or for better

it wasn't a positive experience for me
I was psychotic and convinced I had unlocked the cheat codes to life and had to move to the next phase, and I didn't want to do that I kept wanting to live in this dimension, didn't accept what they were showing me and had psychosomatic stomach issues for months that followed.

It lasted me around 8 hours and at first I felt nothing but the anticipation for it to start, then I could feel a strange tingling in my pee pee like when you urinate. My stomach started to feel funny and I burst out laughing with everyone and we laughed so hard, our stomachs hurt. After getting kicked out of the house we walked the streets. Everything was the same but we were paranoid of everything and each other
We saw places that changed to horror sets like Freddie's Nightmare

We tried to scare each other but ended up scaring ourselves. Our skin looked purple and green and we thought we were aliens. After running around and acting crazy we got to the local park and climbed some trees watching the morning workers head to the office, we thought they were all ants.

Then we went back to my Moms house and she we mental at us all, saying what the fuck have we been on. Told use to shower and clean ourselves up and go to bed

Amazing experience but after that it never hit like the first time

>it makes you insane 
for ~12 hours*. just hoping no one interprets that as permanently insane

If you look at your finger prints you can see an entire village of people from adventure time in them. You open a third eye. It can also be like being dragged to hell and back if you aren't careful. It's a HARD drug.

That's a beautifully accurate way to describe it.

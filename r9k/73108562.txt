I have decided that I will always be alone. I have tried, but I have given up on fostering relations with other human beings. I have found that I fulfill myself, and if I am lacking, I will improve on those very things. All I need is me, and myself will always be there for me. The day myself stops improving or caring for myself it is the end. Then there is no longer continuing on. Any other anons? Take the clear pill.

Do I know you?
Anyway, what made you come to this conclusion? A recent fallout or something?

Not really, just finally clicked. I am the one to push ideas in most groups I am in. If I don't speak up, I am not included. So, I am done with that I suppose? I have also realized I generally am more productive and have more "fun" when i am alone pursuing my own pursuits.

Sucks to be you then I suppose?

But do you want to or have you just given up on it? 

Socializing always felt like a chore, no matter how much i liked the person, and everyone being hostile towards me for no reason. That because of my mental issues probably, I'll be happy to live and die this way because it's the only way I can be at peace without drugs.

Of course if I meet somebody naturally I won't shun them. I would love to have a best friend. However, I am not going to try anymore and if it happens it happens and if it doesn't it doesn't. Socializing does feel like a chore, however, I think it isn't supposed to..

I think we are on the same page anon, overall.

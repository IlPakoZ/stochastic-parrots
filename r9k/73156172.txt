>>73156710
ohhh that sounds really good
>is it safe to do that where you are?
yeah my city is really safe even at night
plus this part of town is completely empty at night, its why i come here 
its also great for riding, you can see how the street is super straight, it actually goes like that for almost 5km so its just amazing
>>73156714
if i see you you're done
>>73156740
yeah i cant help it night time is just so much better
i only have cigs with me but im actually gonna go to the shop on my way home so i might get something from there
boring week desu but i dont mind im stressing over university exams coming up in a month or so and im just trying to take my mind off it
--- 73156810

im almost home now so no more pics but tomorrow night maybe i'll go out for a longer walk and do a proper thread for that, its fun
i actually have an idea but idk if anyone would be interesteed, i can ask my brother to send me an old gopro he has and i was thinking of setting it up on my motorcycle and streaming from it as i ride around a bit around town at night if anyone wants to see
>>73156854
i just get nervous for no reason around stuff like that
i mean its literally an english exam so i should hope i do ok on that
but my dad is also making me take the history exam even though i probably wont need it and i actually have to study for that
>>73156834
tyty
--- 73156947
>>73156885
>perturbator
kek, i was gonna initially as if you're out on /nightwalk/ and listening to synthwave, but thought it's too cliche

>setting it up on my motorcycle and streaming from it as i ride around a bit
that's quite and endeavour
might be a bit self-doxxing tho
--- 73156998
>>73156885
>almost home now so no more pics
post hand pic
--- 73157011
>>73156947
its the best music for this time of night desu 
>that's quite and endeavour
yeah im not really sure how to do it i just know its possible and i can probably figure it out if i really decide to do it
>might be a bit self-doxxing tho
i just have to be careful i think, i'll be wearing a helmet anyway and i wouldnt show where i live or anything
its just an idea if it turns out to be too hard i'll just give up lol
--- 73157024
>>73157011
>if it turns out to be too hard i'll just give up
fail-safe approach lol

Repost, unoriginal, reported.
Get better baits unless you're trying to come up here and cuddle me, you pig mask wearing freak.
Aww are you scared? I don't fear you in the slightest. You're small and weak.

--- 73157077
>>73157055
You won't do shit. You'll be too frozen by how sweet I am and I'll make you weak. Oh wait, I already did that. We both know you're too scared to do anything.
You're a 5801. Simple as.
--- 73157088
>>73157011

--- 73157233
>>73157011
where would you even stream it? youtube or twitch?
--- 73157243
>>73157233
dunno
does it really matter? which one would be better
--- 73157325
>>73157243
no idea, thought you already got that figure out kek
probably youtube is stabler, but either should work
i'd be ok with just some catposter and her bike pics though
--- 73157369
>>73157325
nah i literally came up with this a couple of hours ago when i was having breakfast/dinner
--- 73157394
>>73157169

--- 73157584
>>73157488
A midnight snack, maybe...?
--- 73157622
>>73157488
What I meant tho is that meal time is conducive to introspection and new ideas
Also poop time
--- 73157695
>>73157622
ohh yeah definitely
i love this time of night, its 4 am here
my window is open and i can hear the trains passing by every now and then, because everything else is so quiet
--- 73157727
>>73157695
>and i can hear the trains passing by every now and then
ugh catposter, you're saying all the right words...
night and trains is ultimate peak comfy
--- 73157751
>>73157695
daydreaming at night is the best
that feel of not being part of the world...
--- 73157812
>>73157727
its so amazing
i dont even live close to the tracks, it must be 3-4km from me but i can hear them
when i was 16 me and some friends hopped on a train for fun but got caught really quickly and got in a lot of trouble
i really wanna do it again but im too scared to do it alone
theres something so romantic and exciting about traveling by train, i really dont know why but it makes me excited just thinking about it
even just walking along the train tracks is fun, especially out in the country when you sometimes see old train tracks that are no longer in use, its so fun to just imagine where they must have went
>>73157751
yup
its why i love the night so much
its so peaceful
i feel like the city is mine, like im alone and i stop caring about everything
its so nice to just disconnect
--- 73157915
>>73157812
I don't live anything near train tracks sadly, but once i was visiting my brother in Amsterdam and he was living right by a city train station. 
It was night, very quiet, there were some lights slowly blinking on buildings and I could watch the city trains slowly arriving and departing....
Such a peaceful jazzy feeling, it was otherwordly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpyqxX6JCTM [Embed]
ahhhh i feel like anything is possible
>>73157915
yup i really wonder why trains specifically have that effect on people, its definitely a thing and not just us
--- 73158059
>>73157812
>when you sometimes see old train tracks that are no longer in use, its so fun to just imagine where they must have went
those no-longer-in-use rusty train tracks are sure very nostalgia inducing. seems even a bit unreal that they had been actually in use at some point
--- 73158125
>>73158059
>seems even a bit unreal that they had been actually in use at some point
omg exactly
on the way to my grandmas village theres these tracks in the middle of nowhere and ever since i was a kid i always wondered where they went and why they were there
they just seem so out place
--- 73158193
>>73158125
Do you watch train cabin vids on youtube? There are lots of channels from all other the world

I was wondering what that disgusting smell is.
--- 73159015
>>73158059
>>73158125
They go to other towns bro..

Pull up google maps look to nearest town in the direction they're heading, thats where the tracks go. In fact google maps might show you the tracks on its interface in the form of a trail.
--- 73159063
>>73156172 (OP)
You're not cute, you're unemployed. Get a personality and a job.
--- 73159068
>>73159015
no i mean really REALLY old ones that havent been used in ages, theres no trains that use these
those specific ones near my grandmas house literally disappear into the dirt at some point and then reappear after a while, they're not maintained at all and are about 2km from where the current tracks are
>>73159063
okay
sorry
--- 73159177
>>73159068
Do you like trains? I find them very interesting, train tracks and stuff. Only because I read Maitetsu desu.
--- 73159329
>>73159068
In my town there were train tracks that were (poorly) removed, which created a shoddy trail. We happened to move into a house that connected to this trail on the property line, and you'd find remains of the tracks somewhat frequently while walking it. About 14 years ago they put work into the trail, elevating it from pothole ridden dirtbike trail to beautiful nature trail for walking. 

It..goes to other towns. As is quite the point of train tracks.

Please pipe me to isekai world little creature, there's nothing left for me here. Take me down the drain to another world where women aren't so curuel and nobody is disappointed in me.

Why do people assume you're friends when it wasn't really established?

With relationships, people at least make it official before saying they're in a relationship. But the same rule doesn't apply to friendships (evidently), and it's a regular occurrence for people to consider you a friend (or friends) when you never explicitly agreed to it.

Smile and nod and say sure, we're friends

But you know deep down you can't trust any nigga on these streets

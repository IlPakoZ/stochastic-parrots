And the Beast was cursed for failing to help an old ugly woman. At least in the 90s version he was.

Correct. Men have been groomed, too. Only for different things. But she's also wrong. The gender specific brainwashing only works because it appeals to our innate selves. The format of those stories appeals to women overlooking a violent asshole's misdeeds as long as he's either rich (50 shades) or handsome (Ted Bundy). It hacks the childcaring instinct of women.

women love when a terrifyingly ugly man posses and abuses them that's why those stories are popular this foid is just bpd splitting about some guy she used to fuck

I've been groomed since childhood to be a "chivalrous knight".

We're told in every which way that our existence should be based around serving women and that we'll be rewarded with a female companion if we do good things.

Defeat their enemies, continually put yourself in peril, slay the dragon of chaos and generally be a charming ray of sunshine at all times.

I think of all the possible scenarios, of me doing what other guys do to get laid, and I realize that I could never be happy in such a situation. I also realize that this shit is going to get worse before it gets worse. The world is getting ever more complicated and thus facile stereotypes become ever more valuable as no one has time to get to know people. The world of plenty has made man and even woman more disposable than ever. Anyone who doesn't fit the mold gets thrown on the garbage heap. Humans are still owned, and don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. 

Allegedly the more feminine among women aren't having such a good time, either. While they do get pity and support, it's always in the spirit of convincing them they're oppressed for wanting to play house IRL and that fweedom lies in doing male stereotypical things because "muh feminism". Allegedly on twitter, trad women get the same level of shit as white people and incels. It's gonna be some site to behold when the camel jockeys finally start patrolling and the SJW longhouse sends basedboys and women in maternal flightsuits to die in a desperate attempt to maintain gynocentrism. Feminazis kicked out a snake and let in a dragon. Some chess move! 

Though actually, we let them take control. Or rather, we let in a snake in the form of Jewish feminism. (Snake in the garden, lol!) That's exactly when the girl power strand of female activism was introduced into the Western mainstream.

she doesn't realize that the beast in beauty and the beast was rich. same with the frog in princess and the frog. they cannot be incels. she fundamentally does not understand those stories or the luxurious lifestyle that is obtained by the women in those stories once they choose to marry the men in those stories. stupid roastie doesn't even know what she's talking about.

Yes. We figured out a long time ago that this is the key to a stable civilization. Promote monogamy and everyone finds a partner. Leave things to the natural order, where Chad has 90% of the women and 90% of the men have nothing, and you get a bitter unstable underclass of men that will inevitably revolt. This is why the middle east hasn't seen peace in 1000 years, they reject monogamy and are terminally infested with violent incels. Forced monogamy is a prerequisite for a stable society. Sub-par women should settle for sub-par men instead of going for Chad and leaving those sub-par men to become resentful.

In disney movies their's nearly always a cast of beta male characters who propel the female character into the relationship with the rich prince, with absolutely nothing gained for themselves. 

What exactly do the dwarves get out of all that drama with snow white? 
>She doesn't marry any of them. 
>She doesn't come back and go "hey guys, guess what? you should meet all my female dwarf friends I made now that I live at the castle". 
>In other variations of the story some of the dwarves end up dead in the conflict with the evil queen. 

What does Sebastion the crab get out of all this drama with ariel, and nearly being chopped up and eaten by the cook? 
>Again absolutely nothing. Ariel doesn't turn into a cute female crab, he doesn't meet another cute female crab, he just bounces around the entire story making things happen for ariel with nothing gained for himself. 

In Beauty &amp; The Beast, what fo the servants get?
>The servants are literally transformed into household objects to serve their master because of some curse they had nothing to do with then once again their only goal in life to to aid in the girl hooking up with the prince/beast guy. 

The girl is wondering why she's suppose to save the beast prince, but I'm more worried why this poor guy has to live most of his life out as a clock. Or why in the entire universe there doesn't seem to be any female dwarves. 

The backdrop of these stories is that literally everyone exist only so that the pretty girl can run through a bunch of drama to get with the prince - with no reward for themselves.

Dude wtf even I never thought of that shit. 

Almost every Disney princess has a crew of beta males working invisibly in the background, who exists solely to get the princess and Chad to hook up.

Quasimodo was a annoying cunt, creep and rapist in the original book. And esmeralda was retarded. Gwynplaine was a much better example of a disfigured person with a pure heart. 
Quasimodo is the epitomy of incel, an ugly bitter retarded bastard that would be better off dead.

Yeah I think about this too. I've been hanging out with normies (coworkers) for the first time in years recently, and I've noticed they're constantly going out of their way to talk to random women just because they're physically good looking. Part of me is jealous because they're actually pretty successful, but another part of me doesn't want to bother trying to make conversation with people I don't know that are probably not anywhere near as autistic as I am. It's really confusing because I say shit I think people will understand, like I joked today about how after I got drunk "a tree was eyeing me up" and I "ejaculated on it with mouth," and for a good 30 seconds they legit thought I was talking about cumming on a tree instead of throwing up on one. I don't get it all normies listen to is rap aren't they supposed to understand wordplay?

Are they saying "ugly" people are incels? That sounds like a cruel thing to say. What a horrible person. I've only ever seen one post on that subreddit with any measure of empathy or decency. Otherwise they're just spiteful bullies. Reddit's weird like that.

Women are too narcissistic to truly care about how anybody or anything else feels. Literally nobody and nothing. They can pretend well enough for attention and validation, but I've been around them enough, overheard what they say and get plenty of them venting to me because they know I don't give a fuck enough about them or what they are saying or the people involved to blab. Women are the absolute fucking worst

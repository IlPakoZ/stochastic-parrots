i dont play video games and unlike ordinary people i dont consume much online content (facebook, youtube, instagram, tiktok, etc.). i only consume a bit from one site, 4chan.

but yeah sure, programming, writing, baking, reading, lifting weights, hiking, and so on.

I've tried, but in the end the only thing outside, Netflix, YouTube, or anything online for me is books. No matter what I do, i never like it enough to spend enough time in it so it could be called a hobby. I've tried wood working, Smith working, pottery, gardening, hiking, riding a bicycle, riding a motorcycle, driving to other towns, long distance running, theater, guitar, and a few others, a few with other people too, but in the end I enjoy being by myself the most, and the best time of my life is when i scape from life itself, like reading a book, or... being online... Oh, i like to drink, and even though I hate doing it with others, i usually do, so that doesn't turn into an addiction that fast, does it count as a hobby?

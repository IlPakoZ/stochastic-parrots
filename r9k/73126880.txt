the femcel argument of MEN ONLY WANT SEX is so damn wrong see a fucking 39 years old woman of all thing is crying because the men she hooks up with want a relationship.
MEN are the romantic sex not women
WWOMEN initiate most divorce
WOMEN are the primary force behind hook up culture
Incels are very real and as an incel it's impossible to get even a female friend women just hate me because of my appearance 
also NOTA BENE for supposed femcels
If a guy doesn't want to have a relationship with you but wants sex out of you it probably got something to do with your personality unironically like why wouldn't you date someone you're attracted to unless they're not interesting at all
BUT if you're a man and you can't date anyone it likely has nothing to do with personality since the average man has a lot more to offer personality wise than the average woman and women discrimninate mostly based on looks i mean women don't sex men they wouldn't date usually unless they're whore like pic rel

LOL you are delusional. Only women are romantic. There's a reason why simps are called trans women.

When women say men only want sex, they are talking about high value men who are actually ale to get regular no-strins-attached sex. Not some random loser so insecure and desperate for affection that all he craves is to be a woman's first and only lover for life. 

High value men have are able to navigate the "market" similar to how attractive women do. They can and will fuck a lot of people while they sit back and wait for one good enough to actually commit and get into a relationship with. And women don't like that they are on the rung of just sexual partner, not good enough for relationship material and commitment. 

I've known a lot of women much the same. They will meet plenty of guys who meet their standards for a one night stand. They could be douchey, or stupid, or a druggie. Still fuckable for them, but not what they want for their future. So they fuck them while the wait for "the one."

That's my point though. People who don't have affection and commitment freely available are going to be more likely to crave it. Someone who's had easy access to it for their whole life is more likely to be disenchanted or even bored with it. They're not going to entertain any average woman who shows the slightest bit of interest in them and immediately start crushing on them like a lot of robots would. They'll probably just pump and dump and move on, why waste time on something so common. Not special.

Why is seeing someone as good enough to fuck but not wanting to be in a relationship with them the same as not seeing them as men? 

And do you think robots would be any different given the opportunity? If robots could freely pick amongst 5-7/10 women who fall short of ther standards either physically or personality wise, and occasional 8-9/10s who are closer to their ideal, they might form a long term relationship with a 6 for a while, until the novelty of being in a relationship wore off. Then you can bet your ass most would eventually upgrade or continue fucking women lower on the scale until they get bored or find an opportunity to upgrade. 

I don't understand how robots are delusional enough to think the difference is between genders and not just human nature and disparity in circumstance.

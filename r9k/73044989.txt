Hey fellow robots. How's it like to have a father? 
My father left my mom the day I was born and I have never seen him. I'm just wondering how much I've missed out.

They drink a lot, yell a lot, beat your mom, and go to prison. 6/10 experience overall

What's your opinion on conservative zoomers calling fags "fatherless" or say shit like "fatherless behavior" ?

I think they're projecting. I'm pretty sure most zoomers have family issues

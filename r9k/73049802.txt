I fucking hate this shit. I go to work so I can get a pay check, not to entertain boomers and geezers. Am I supposed to change who I am to satisfy these cunts? Keep in mind ive been there for almost half a year now so a lot of them have stopped trying to engage me in conversation, so they are all talking shit behind my back.

Then keep doing it, and don't care about them Anon.

You should have seen this coming. You were submissive and every time they poked further you submitted further until they feel comfortable giving you a degrading nickname. I may be an abject failure at life but I would have established immedietly upon the 1st shit test I would not be belittled or disrespected in any capacity. Being naturally handsome and supremely high IQ helps establish this respect but you gotta open your mouth firmly the first time they dismiss you or bark orders, you look them into their eye and speak your mind. Now its too late, if you try to act tough now you'll look weird and kinda mass shootery.

You should learn how to be good at passive aggressive communication so you can goad them into acting funny/inappropriately, while you yourself don't cross any culpable lines. Or just be an asshole and stop being a faggot

So all they do is make fun of you for not talking? Being quiet is the only fault they can find in you? If so then I'd say you're doing pretty good, lad.

anon i know this is a hard pill to swallow but the surviving in this world means being fake sometimes. everyone has a work persona. you will never succeed if you show your true personality at work. i don't know if you're only gonna aim for minimum wage jobs or something but you have to learn how to schmooze, squeaky
--- 73050236

It's your first job and it's only been half a year. I would if I was you relax and try to enjoy yourself with the people you do get along with if any. You have many years of employment ahead of you so I think this is a good experience for you. But everyone has their own path. Maybe you oughta get a job in a warehouse or something where it's mostly dudes so it's not as bad maybe. There are shitheads everywhere though and a decade from now or even 5 years I'll bet you're gonna think what you're dealing with now isn't that bad at all.

People are tribalistic, if you're not like them, they don't like you, and they'll show it.
I got it all the time while working, when I was working in a factory. They used to sing , like a 9 stone cowboy, to the tune of rhinestone cowboy, because I walk funny, and I don't weigh that much.
Normies are cunts, and people aren't much different on here at times.
We shouldn't have to change who we are, just to fit in their world.
--- 73050374
>>73050365
Maybe you won't think normies are cunts if you put in a shred of effort to be likeable and "fit in their world".
You get back what you put in, anon.
--- 73050388
>>73049802 (OP)
I'm lucky my office job doesn't allow any kind of bullying, if someone dared to insult someone here they would be at risk of losing their job
--- 73050416
>>73050374
Yes, i know normies are cunts
--- 73050439
>>73050374
So if i put in nothing and am indifferent to them, then i deserve to be hated, bullied and reviled by my peers? Really? I have to dedicate my time to amuse and pander to the normies or they have a moral obligation to humiliate me to no end? You have a really fucked up worldview, almost like a normie.
"But he likes nerdy things!! I simply HAVE to bully and ostracise him!"
--- 73050442
>>73050416
Sure about that one pal? Sounds like you're the swishy 9 stone faggot on the team. Maybe if you put some effort into yourself you can earn some respect.
--- 73050454
>>73050374
Why should we make the effort with them, if they don't reciprocate?
Tried for a while to fit in, but if you're not like them, they don't like you. Sat for hours beating myself up because I'm not like them, trying to fit in their world.
The fuck has this place turned into? Normie fucks are all over.
--- 73050457
>>73050442
Yes I am certain of that. It is self evident really
--- 73050461

Why would anyone like you if you won't even make an attempt to be likeable?

It really doesn't fucking matter in the grand scheme of things, why bother making an effort if you don't want to talk to them anyway?
--- 73050598
>>73050461
You seem to be unaware of the glaring problem in your doctrine. Because you call me "not the protagonist", but the same obviously doesn't go for the other people in your view. Why should i like them and pander to them if they do nothing to appease me? In fact, according to you, everyone should hate everyone when they meet, because they aren't pandering to each other.
No, i'm not going to get buddy-buddy with the guy who calls me a faggot bitch, i'm going to fucking beat the shit out of him, you moronic jackass. You act as if we live in a fucking post-apocalyptic dystopia where no common decency exists and everyone is expected to kill anyone they come across.
--- 73050602

That shows they are not better than us, and we all lack something. Maybe they are lashing out at others for the things they don't like about themselves, but that is no excuse for being a cunt.
--- 73050895
unless you're literally not communicating like with what ur supposed to be doing at work, small talk and bullshitting does not matter
--- 73050973
This depends if OP is just socially retarded and doesn't know what to do or he feels he's too good to associate with normies and they can sense his arrogance. Spergs usually are the latter as they're solipsistic and lack the social awareness to understand they'll be consequences to their obnoxious behavior around "NPCs".
--- 73051115
>>73050845
I used to think it was because I was just a bad person that they treated me like that, sort of like that 
>bullying is le eugenics and exists to punish the weak xD 
that an anon on this board is a very firm believer of and sometimes makes threads about "why bullying is good". Now I realise that I just happened to be very scrawny and very ugly in my teenage years, which made me a big target for other insecure teens.

>Spergs usually are the latter as they're solipsistic and lack the social awareness to understand they'll be consequences to their obnoxious behavior around "NPCs".
We fully understand because we've lived our entire lives around you. We just often think normalfags are obnoxious and not deserving of respect. Also you don't know what solipsism is
--- 73051259
>>73051130
You don't get to dictate who deserves respect when you aren't worthy of it yourself. Respect comes from the fear of something more powerful that yourself and normies innately recognize this falling in line in within the social hierarchy. Spergs don't which is why they get themselves into heaps of trouble when they don't adhere to any superior authority that they believe they're above or doesn't exist.
--- 73051305
>>73051115
I have a fren, who is married and has children, and 1 of his sons is a sperg, and he said he sometimes bullies him to get him to respond and fight back. I think he's seen what's happened to me over the years, and doesn't want that for his son. I've always lacked confidence, so I think building that would be a good start to helping him to be able to eventually react.
--- 73051377
>>73050784
I only made one of the posts by the way, dumbass
--- 73051718
>>73051305
actually bullying has been found to permanently inhibit confidence. his son is becoming more timid and tamer by the interaction.

they've found bullies tend to come from wealthier, more pampered, less antagonistic situations. That is, they have never had someone bully them or ever be aggressive to them and that's why they're so confident. If his son lacks confidence, its because his father hasn't provided him a wealthy spoiled enough life.

I've met bully types from working class backgrounds mainly, but get what you're saying.

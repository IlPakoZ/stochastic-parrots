Literally the joke to every sundae kids comic is that the female is cheating

1). There's a difference between being mean and teasing (though, not as much of a difference as people like to think).
2). Meanness can get across a sense of fun better than niceness (at least sometimes). And people kind of like to banter with each other, anyway (which is roughly what the comic is showing).

Mischievous = mean, depending on the context and people involved.

But what's depicted in the comic is pretty light, and fun-and-games.

most of the time its just because they happen to be physically more attractive. looks is the most significant stat in dating/sex life.
also a lot of people use being a dick to kind of engage with the girl while also not being a 'simp'.

Mean guys can dominate other guys, nice guys can't.

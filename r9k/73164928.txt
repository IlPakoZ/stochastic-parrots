This. We've tried being civil and patient with these people but they're a social disease and you don't rationalize a dangerous illness, you remove it from your body.

>a small verbal minority complained about us from time to time.
I weep for you, I really do. As a straight white male just about anything I do will get pushback and be diminished as something that was only achieved with white privilege. You fucking draw a stick figure and put it on twitter and you're the most creative artist of the week and it's impressive. wowe.
That and the vast majority of us paid 0 attention to you until you forced your way into every facet of society you possibly could and started getting hyper verbal about your psychotic bullshit and pushing your ideals onto us. You are not the victim, and the fact that people are getting more and more ugly towards you is because we are all coming to terms with the reality that what you are and how you act towards us will never not be malicious. You won't stop hating us or beating us or pushing us to do what you want no matter how hard we accept and love you as a collective.
Our only sane option is to push back anymore. 
This is all coming from a guy who just to give trannies a chance when I met them.

What's the point of doing no fap if I have no chances of even dating a girl? 
It's unrealistic to expect for someone with a life like mine. It's like being a methhead but the meth is infinite and I have it on me at all times amd there are meth adds and reminders to take meth and I've been addicted since middle school

just do no fap if you're addicted to porn and fapping to the point that is the only "hobbie" you do, it's just not natural fapping so much

Addiction of any kind is terrible for your brain

I think that's a strawman. Nobody does this.

I know it's bad but it provides short term release and in my current situation I have no shot in getting any sort of girl so why quit now?

Idk your situation, but you could definitely go to a bar this weekend and meet a chick willing to fuck. But you are too shy / anxious / socially retarded. I get it. Ultimately, I think it's about self respect. By continuing to do something you know is bad for you, you are telling yourself that you don't care about your own well being. If you don't care and wish to live like that then no one can stop you.

not OP but what if I just don't want to take part in that fucked up "dating" game of just having casual sex and then possibly having a relationship. What if I want to remain a virgin until marriage? Am I fucked?

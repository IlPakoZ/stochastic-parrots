I have no idea who this girl is, she was kinda cute tho.
My friend thought I knew her and was also surprised when I told him i have no idea who she is.
I'm very active in class, i respond to the teacher's questions and I suggest debate topics to discuss in class. Did this call her attention? Because I would sincerely give myself a 4/10 in a good day.

Why would she do this?

Don't overthink it, anon. Maybe strike up a conversation with her some time, or offer her a sweet back. You can do it.

Start talking to her. If she seems pleasant, ask her out. Don't be like me in uni and self-sabotage the plethora of opportunities that fall straight into your lap.

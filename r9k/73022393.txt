there is a terminal length to hair. you can grow your hair pretty long if you take good care of it and prevent it from splitting, but i imagine the length in picrel is not accessible for all women

Afaik hair splitting is somewhat impacted by stress. So with the amount of psycho-medicated lunatic females the modern world has around, good luck getting that to work.

Right. The lifecycle of the hair in the follicle. There is a growing phase, a pause phase, and a shed phase. Body hair is a great example since it has a short growth phase and then long pause before the shed.... also, when I tried to post this, I got this:

lol! I don't even troll! It seems everytime I turn on my hotspot, connect my laptop, I end up with a previously banned IP. what the hell?!? The last time this happened was a week ago with a ban till the 22nd of this month, AND it flagged all my devices and sain ban evasion, not letting me appeal to say it wasn't me! The IP ban system is a stupid joke

years ago I used to know a girl with beautiful coppery-red hair that went down to about her butt
there is no happy ending. I never dated her and she eventually cut it all off, to less than shoulder-length, since it was such a pain to take care of.

my hair grows fast as fuck, but I cut it back to shoulder length whenever its almost at nipple height, it just becomes too much of a pain and too hot in summer
its thick as fuck too like pic rel
I also cant be bothered tying it up carefully all the time
If you dont though, as soon as you go outside it just turns into a static mess getting in your eyes and mouth
Im a guy obviously btw, I think most tied up looks look worse on guys too

Normie men think women who rapunzelmax are mental.

As a guy who had really long hair once, it sucks to clean. I'd spend half an hour washing it, and that was only when it was down to my shoulderblades.

Normal men don't give a fuck about small things like that

Just bring back "garden gnome" as a job. Rich people used to employ people to just live in their garden as decorations.

It's a floor, what's different about this one? Something about a floor? How could there be something about a floor? Did somebody get killed on that floor?

Get diagnosed with autism and be unable to hold a job or be self-employed due to autism. Apply for autismbux, get denied the first time due to lack of evidence, then hire Jewish law firm to apply for autismbux and receive them, and get double autismbux after putting any savings and assets into a trust and maintaining under $2000 balance.

Say it's to help black people or use terms coded to mean black people like "unemployed," "low income," "drug addicted," "inner city," "struggling," "homeless," etc, but when writing out the actual program that the politicians vote on, don't actually put a racial limit in there, so that anyone of any race can claim it.

Can't be done. The gibs party wants to cut your children's cocks off. Makes the whole thing unpalatable. A real shame, but nothing can be done.

can also be done with major depression and a 3 day hold. The autism won't work if you've been to college or ever had a job.

This, just fearmonger about AI and how everyone will starve if we don't start implementing some kind of UBI soon.

This can be hard to fake, and can risk you losing freedoms for threatening to kys or staging an attempt. Most robots are somewhat autistic though, and since there was little autism awareness before the 2010s, attorneys can argue that you were born with a severe disability, but were overlooked in school or misdiagnosed until you finally got mental health care and evaluation as an adult. 

>The autism won't work if you've been to college or ever had a job.
Wrong. In fact your experiences of getting repeatedly warned and later fired for autistic behavior at work give you a stronger case. They don't give everyone a mental health assessment in college, and you use the same excuse that you were unaware you had autism, other kids just called you weird and retarded, and it was only later on when you finally were able to see a psychiatrist and confirmed that you had autism your whole life and it is a severely debilitating condition.

Personally though I feel it's just a difference, not a disability, the normies are the ones who are dysfunctional... but I'll play along for purposes of Jewing the system for government cheese. To any glowies listening, yes, I am actually autistic and unable to work due to complications of this permanent neurological condition.

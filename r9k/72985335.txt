transition and then with access to makeup,pushup bras,wigs etc. you will go from a 3/10 incel to a 8/10 stacy.

My eyes are good but my lower face falters
Alot of people day it's from frowning too much
>>72985349
Stop being a fag
Im a guy

I'm a girl but I have a similar problem. I have a very depressed looking face, not in a cute sadgirl way, in an 'ages me 10 years' way.

I noticed it goes away with gravity and specific lighting
During the day my jowls are highlighted and I have thick framed glasses that make my eyes look smaller

Picrel
The lighting and no glasses really help
I need to get contacts but I'm scared of putting stuff in my eyes
--- 72985538
>>72985507
Glasses aren't a bad thing at all. I think they can look really nice, and it's not worth sticking shit in your eyes if it makes you uncomfy. I wear glasses too because contacts make me feel icky. Sorry if you don't want to be compared to someone like him but you kind of look like a cuter version of Salvador Ramos. I genuinely believe you could quite easily get a gf. You're far from ugly, anon.

I can't tell if you're a dude or a chick
what are you exactly ?
--- 72985574
>>72985335 (OP)

Just either KYS or troon out for the BBC. 

Its sadly the fate for most Mayocels.

>Salvador Ramos

Thanks tho
>>72985562
I'm a guy
Shit, really dude?

I fucking forgot to spoiler
Also it's an update pic from right now

>>72985607
Ah sorry lol I knew it was a bit weird but I had to say it. Don't listen to that other anon who is probably just seething because you mog him. You don't look feminine at all.
--- 72985752
>>72985681
but he does look androgynous
I guess his hairs are more on the male side but that's it
why are you white knighting some random anon anyway
--- 72985764
>>72985752
I enjoy being nice and though OP might want a girl's opinion. Not white knighting, just being honest.
--- 72985772
>>72985764
you disgust me 
being nice is a sign of weakness 
you probably have an agenda anyway
--- 72986271
Go to the gym, I guess. I'm ugly as fuck and people used to make fun of me in public but after I started lifting it stopped, hopefully they're scared I'll straight up murder them if they say anything.
--- 72986536
>see thread about people saying they're ugly
>they post pics
>they're always numerous points better looking than me
>they're only socially ugly which is a 5/10
>they're not actually ugly which is 0-3/10
You people will never know what it's like to actually be ugly. I hope you all die.

I have lived alone for so long and have closed my heart to all emotions due to the hurt I've felt throughout the years that at some point I am overcome with such extreme emotional agony that is physically tangible. It is such deep physical pain it feels like I'm burning in hell but on the inside. I have such pain often very strongly when I dream in sleep as well. ANYONE ELSE KNOW THIS FEELING PLEASE TELL ME

Must be your subconscious having a panic attack

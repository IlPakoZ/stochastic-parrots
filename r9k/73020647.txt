I like tribal garbage that accentuates the bodies of women. I just don't like shit like a drawing of some mascot or some shit like that. Also those fake tits look terrible.

She looked way better before the fake tits, such a shame. Similarly sexy girl got a terrible tattoo on her stomach. The thing is girls that are this hot, but also mentally ill enough to put themselves out in this fashion will inevitably self destruct like this pic shows, sad but true.

--- 73022973
>>73022907
Yes. Most men are very desperate and will overlook tattoos. They'll look at it in disgust every day and never say anything because men are generally broken and miserable. 
I said no to tatted girls and all of my friends would tell me I'm getting too old to be picky and some went as far as questioning my sexuality. I found a girl who became my wife down the road but it's so normal to wrangle the tatted hogs people will think you're going to kill yourself or are in the closet if you don't.

--- 73023575
>>73020707
I actually like how she looks here.
There is something of a classic feminine beauty in it. Big eyes, high kind brows, thin nose, plump lips but small mouth, soft round face. This is a girl that would have been artists muse in 18th century, but modernity is spoiled by bimbowhores and animetoilets. 
Also she looks distinctely armenian
--- 73023900
unless you have some really ugly looking or shaped tits, you should avoid getting a boob job at all costs. 95% of the time, it looks awful

oh hannah...

>>73020647 (OP)
It's gotten to the point where I don't approach women because so many have tattoos, anyone could have anything anywhere I don't see, and it would ruin my physical attraction, like I would not want to be physically intimate with someone with any tattoo anywhere. I guess I have to strip-search women first before asking them out.

Like seriously. Imagine you met some cute chick in person or online, got together with her and when her pants come off or you go to the pool or beach together, you see fucking this. You never suspected it, she was too pretty for tattoos, but the has fucking tattoos on her fucking thigh, totally ruined, disgusting.
--- 73024092
>>73024056
Idk it might just be me but imo tattoos really aren't that bad, it just depends on size and location mainly, and also what the tattoo is of in the first place.
--- 73024140
>>73024092
I don't care what it is, although tattoos on the legs or red colored ones are the most disgusting to me. Point is that I am attracted to the entire female body, the skin, not some part of it, or something abstract like "personality." Tattoos simply ruin my sensual enjoyment of women completely.

hot wheels tattoo.
the only good thing about her was her face, but i prefer her tits now. small ones can look nice but hers had that deflated saggy look to them. made her nipples look way nicer too.
but i'm also not really attracted to women. i'm either a closet pedo or faggot, i can't tell yet.

You're fucked up in the he though. Yeah tatoos are awful but is it a really deal breaker?
--- 73024311
>>73024252
>Normal chicks don't get shit like your pic anon
Yes they do. I constantly see examples right in front of me in real life, and online, not just porn. You really never know. And I have actually met women, approached them after class or at a party, and we were flirting with each other heavily, and then only later I see or learn about the tattoo on their calf, and I have zero interest after that
>Yeah tatoos are awful but is it a really deal breaker?
Yes. They are permanent eyesores that ruin female beauty for me. No one cares if men have tattoos, unless they're really cringe- because men are not primarily beauty objects the way female bodies are.
--- 73024340
>>73024252
Tattoos reduce women from a potential partner to 100% a sexual object without any recourse what so ever.
As far as I am concerned tattoos Brand you as cattle, and that is how you deserve to be treated. 
Honestly when a girl gets a tattoo she should get herself sterilized as well, because then she can live out her life as the cum dumpster that she became without dragging anyone down with her

--- 73024905

The hair is fine, everything else is...an eyesore.
The tattoos downgrade her right to "garbage" rating.
The tits...I like big tits, I love relatively big tits on petite women, but I like them to be natural. The same way I like everything else on a woman to be natural.
Bitch went from "cute girl" to "just another random whore" and yet, she always was just some random whore, the power of appearance/presentation.

are those boobs on the left actually hot to men? i have similar ones, with a wide frame like her, and it just looks stupid. small boobs + a big frame on a woman is a big body failo. on left she just looks like something is missing, because the boobs don't look proportionate.

--- 73027558

I think its cute. 
The thing with most men is that there is a limit where a girl becomes cute. After that personality and stuff 100% takes over and is more important. This is definetly past that point, I feel like they might be a bit more semetrical but nothing to fuss over. Also better then cow tits.
I am not sure I like smaller

Maybe if her tattoo was better thought out/composed and less awkwardly cheap tribal looking?


Plus I hope her tits in that pic are still recovering? Because otherwise yeah, not the best look sadly

--- 73027886

No this is not how men think.
Cute means:
Its a girl that would make a good long term partner and I would like to creampie her until she has my children.
Hot means:
I want to tap that. With a condom.
And then throw it away. 

You can decide which one you want to be.
But hot girls dancing on a stage are not cute and they are not wife material.

The boobs are fine the obvious scar is not. Because of the scar we are only thinking of fake titts doesnt matter if they look good. Well hopefully the scar gets less obvious with time.
--- 73029338
>>73028684
Not particularly, but that picture only has one set of boobs in it and they're on the left. The... "things..." on the right are not boobs. Not only do they not create any sexual feelings within me but they actively turn me off. It sucks every girl can't have perfect boobs. But mutilating yourself like that isn't an improvement. You're better off just making the best of what you've got. 

(BTW I say the same thing for guys re hair loss, dick size, steroids, etc.)
--- 73029416

These boobs look better then op even though they are tiny because they are well formed

everyone should get tattoos. it helps your body feel more like "yours" and is a great filter for control freaks. Unless you are a slave to a super trad family, what are the downsides?

>you is what is defined by tattoos
This is precisely the problem, so you feel like you need to express yourself using tattoos like you have absolutely nothing to say.
If you want to express yourself, then do something, I do not know, draw something, make something, talk to people, be active in the community.
Be something to someone.
You know.
But instead you think that expressing yourself means putting something - like a fad of fashion - on your skin.
There is nothing more shallow, and indeed I find it hard to find anything more vulgar then that.
Its just pure selfobsessed narcissism coupled with an incredibly shallow unreflectedness that makes it just so damming. Especially coupled with the current social trend of everyone getting a tattoo of exactly the same motive, you are just getting yourself branded as cattle just like all the other cattle.
No thank you.
A tattoo is a huge red flag.
The only case where a girl at all benefits from having tattoos is if she is already completely insane and anyone should run for their lives. It can make that insane girl hotter to fuck if you do not value your own life, also she should have lots of tattoos then. That is the only case where its at all a good thing, anything else just no.
--- 73029621
>>73020647 (OP)
There is nothing wrong with this.
In fact I encourage it.
--- 73029687
>>73029618
not sure where you got that from. getting a tattoo is, at most, a demonstration that you can make your own decisions about your body. I'm sure some people who are very into the culture define their value based on their ink, but most people are very casual about their tattoos.
You don't have to like them, though, and in fact, it's better if you're clear about your feelings about them so people don't need to waste their time with a control freak. Literally better for everyone involved.

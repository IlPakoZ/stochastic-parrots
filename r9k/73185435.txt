Before the internet, you could move to new place and completely start over; a whole new life. Because your past isn't going to be printed in the newspaper or be talked about on the 6 o'clock news. There's no medium for your past to come back.
But now, people from your past can post about you online. People from high school, ex girlfriends, ex coworkers, etc. It's public; everyone can read it.

I'm honestly a completely different person from 10 years ago. I wish I could just start over.

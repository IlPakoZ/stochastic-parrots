If a woman has a dominant personality and wants a submissive male who pairs well with her, I see no reason why she shouldn't express that publicly. There is no inherent 'dominant' or 'submissive' quality to either masculinity or femininity. Masculinity is the trait dealing with physical and technical challenges, femininity is the trait dealing with emotional and social challenges. There's no reason either one of these necessarily has to "rule" the other; domination and submission are not character traits, they're descriptions of how people interact. The whole thing is relative. If a woman happens to be stronger or more energetic, why shouldn't she dominate?

You're too sarcastic, and you're reading antisemitic messaging into my post where none exists. Has anyone ever accused the Jews of propping up dominant men too much? If anything, the common antisemitic stereotype says the opposite.

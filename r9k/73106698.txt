I miss my spice years.

It was in my early 20s when I started living alone. I was zombified for almost 2 years lmao.

But now it's hard to get stuff that works well. These years were the best years of my life.

I heard this shit is poison. Synthetic cannabinoids in general just completely fucking with people's brains.

I was telling somebody about this the other day that I used to smoke spice back in the day and I remember people would always tell me that I would die from that but I loved that shit so much. It sucks that they banned it. If I could find it again I would definitely smoke it. I don't know maybe.

It was so fucking good and the effects were soo cool and unpredictable. Weed is pussy shit compared to it.

Also nothing happened to me, because I'm an extremely high-inhib guy. I didn't jump out of the window. Only fucking retards are afraid of spice or do dumb shit on it.

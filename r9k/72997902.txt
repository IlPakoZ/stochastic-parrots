Consider the is-ought problem, which asserts that we cannot go from a purely descriptive statement (e.g. Murder makes people upset) to a normative one (e.g. you should not commit murder). This is all well and good, but we do not often consider the disconnect between describing the moral values of behavior and prescribing it. For example, let us take for granted that holding the door is a "good" thing. Many of us would make the leap that, because holding doors for people is good, we "should" hold doors. But a little reflection reveals that such reasoning is just the is-ought problem all over again.

Okay, well I'm gonna do that anyway. Are you gonna tell me I shouldn't?

While the is-ought problem is a significant challenge in moral reasoning, it is not insurmountable. By carefully considering a range of factors and engaging in thoughtful reflection, we can make reasoned judgments about what we ought to do, even in situations where there may be no clear-cut answer.

But the majority of people capable of that reasoning are not in a position to make real moral judgements, and even when they are, they rarely have the time or fall prey to their emotions. Moral reasoning is a complete waste of time.

Then is your opinion that the is-ought problem is not actually a problem, but rather a helpful idiot filter because it bakes your own personal norms into something for normiecattle?

My opinion is that the is-ought problem is not actually a problem because no one "ought" to do anything.

Yet you made that garbage post. Shut up.

There is no moral reason not to make garbage posts, senpai, and no moral reason to make them. Shit just happen, amigo.

Fundamentalists such as religious or determinist would disagree and say that there is a reason for everything. Nothing is random.

Then those people just happen to be retarded. If everything happens for a reason, what's the reason for this:

I am not God, so I can't tell you why He did that. If you repent of your sin and seek Jesus Christ with your whole heart, mind, body, and soul, then ask in His name to send you the Holy Spirit.
Then you can ask God why he made all that.

Also from the determinist: they simply wanted to have some rape, deal with it

>I am not God, so I can't tell you why He did that.
Then how can I be sure you know anything about God at all?
>If you repent of your sin and seek Jesus Christ with your whole heart, mind, body, and soul, then ask in His name to send you the Holy Spirit.
I don't believe in sin so I can't repent of it.
>Then you can ask God why he made all that.
I'll let the people who believe in God scratch their heads over it since I already have a perfectly good explanation without God.
>>72998320
I refuse to worship a being that just "wants to have some rape."

Determinism isn't religious fundamentalism. It's just saying that everything has a reason. Bug rape happens because some bugs like rape. Is that an unacceptable answer? Nobody is asking you to worship bug sex!

Saying it's good is a normative statement because saying it is good is supposed to mean it is desirable/good to do/something you ought to do, isn't it?

You can't. You have to ask God.
>I don't believe in sin so I can't repent of it. I'll let the people who believe in God scratch their heads over it since I already have a perfectly good explanation without God.
So far, your explanation seems to be that nobody ought to do anything and everything is meaningless, yet you are still doing things. So either I don't understand your position correctly, or you are retarded.

To lay the ground level, it's not like approaching girls at the club, who expect a great deal of Game on the side of the guy. Everyone at an anime convention is playing with half a deck. These are not the jocks who got the prom queen in highschool, these people were the nerds getting bullied. I have an us-them mentality, but it's not black and white it's nerd and normie.

So there's a few ways to meet people. The first is cosplaying a showing that is popular that season, attending the cosplay photoshoot, panel, and hanging out with people who are cosplaying the same show as you.
Without wearing a costume, you can play games with other people, and there tends to be a video game section or board game/card game section at most conventions. This can sometimes be in the dealears hall where it will shut down when they do (7-8PM), in this case there will always be people playing cards against humanity and other games in the hallways or tables of the conventions.

Well, there's a lot of peripheral events at conventions too. You have photoshoots, where dedicated fans of one series or another hang out for an hour. Good place to meet girls. Panels are good too, they can be topic specific, or about a game or anime. There's a tabletop area where people play games, and on Saturday nights people will play Cards against humanity on tables, or on the floor, and all these stack up. You can run into the same girl at a fire emblem photoshoot, panel, and then run into her again at some party. And at that point you really have a shot to get a number.

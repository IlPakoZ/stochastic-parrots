Both of my only real close friends just got out of long relationships and they talk about it whenever we hang out, I'm tired of hearing it because I've never been in a relationship. This is neither of theirs first relationship and they probably won't be single for that much longer meanwhile I'm hopeless and to autistic to talk to women

Nothing is wrong with you, anon. You're envious of your friends which is reasonable given your description. All they're trying to do is heal, don't take it personally.

Yeah it's called being unattractive.
You should fix that if you want to not be depressed for the rest of your life.

Rather not say, but pretty shit overall. We got some snow a couple of days ago which almost never happens this time of year. Not to mention the squeeze everyone is feeling with how expensive food is and everything else.

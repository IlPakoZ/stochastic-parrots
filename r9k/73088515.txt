Where the fuck did all these BPD girls come from? I have never heard of this shit until a few months ago. Now every fucking girl claims to have it. Why are people just blatantly making up new mental illnesses?

BPD isn't rea;. It's just another made up "illness" so doctors can prescribe more meds and people empty their pockets for therapy sessions. BPD is literally just being a woman.

why would anyone claim to have this if they didn't? it's like telling people you're a sociopath or you have aspd. it's basically announcing you're going to ruin their life if they get too close.

It's more socially acceptable to claim bpd than vulnerable npd

For attention, to be "not like the other girls" and to fit into the "psycho girl" stereotype that women for some reason think is cool and attractive

99% of them don't have BPD. The reason you're hearing about it is because more and more women are self-dx themselves with bs. Same reason you're hearing about autism so much in media recently

they say bpd and npd are basically mirrors of each other. 
its kinda say that so many would-be BPD cuties turned into narc monsters basically because of social media

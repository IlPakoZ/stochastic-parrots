>>73032966
Where do you live irl?
--- 73032994
>>73032881 (OP)
i just want someone to tell me after how many weeks of dating is it normal to say I love you? or months I guess or should i wait for the guy to say it?
--- 73033013
>>73032979
the US, he has to be asian btw.
--- 73033022
>>73032950
It's just a funny image. Don't take it so seriously. I do think my gf has bpd and I might have either npd or avpd. Never diagnosed and never will be because I don't go to therapy.

>>73032966
Look for ugly and short guys in real lfie and talk to them. Join niche hobbies and give a chance to the weird guy there.

>>73032994
I dated someone for 5 years and never said i love you to her because it never felt right. Meanwhile me and my current girlfriend told it to each other after two weeks. I don't think there is a right answer to that.
If you think you love the person, tell them.

>>73032966
if you live in a big city go to a burn victim support group, i bet theres a lot of incel men there
--- 73033089
>>73033022
>I dated someone for 5 years and never said i love you to her because it never felt right
why would you date someone so long and never say it? were you guys just very young?
--- 73033153
>>73033022
>Join niche hobbies
any recommended hobbies?

not niche obviously but anime clubs are all overrun by normies now. same with any kind of game club. both tabletop and video.

Ya. No. W*men are usually vulnerable narcissists who go for overt narcissists. That's why vulnerable narcissist incels will never attract vulnerable narcissist fems

Wtf is this supposed to be Retard-san and Tranny-kun?
--- 73033181
>>73033022
>I do think
But u dont
--- 73033218
>>73033089
I was 22-27
She was 18-23
The relationship wasn't bad enough for me to leave but I didn't like the girl that much so I just stayed on it.

>>73033153
That's why I said to go for the weird one in those hobbies. A good hobby to go to is larp and the ones you said are good too.
Can also try on online games by joining guilds.

>>73033176
No idea who you are talking about.

>>73033181
=(
--- 73033227
why do so many of you have trouble getting over your exes and what should a gf do in that situation?
--- 73033272

Why are some men, especially incels, obsessed with women's virginity? Most of these men are not virgins by choice and would be willing to fuck any woman with whom they make eye contact for more than two seconds. Ironically they tend to be the most sex-obsessed people out there. I understand that if someone has a long history of casual sex and infidelity it can be a problem for a relationship, but that should not be the case if a girl only had sex with her partners.
--- 73033283
How do I make sure I have a long-term marriage, for what reasons will a man leave his wife?
--- 73033338
>>73033013
literally me. sadly I'm ugly asian
--- 73033349
>>73033338
Like what one of the brown ones? My pussy is for east asian dick only.
--- 73033362
>>73033218
i think larping would require a lot of social courage i don't have yet, not against it though. maybe in the future if everything else fails.
as for joining guilds i've been thinking about trying and just pretending to be a guy until i meet a cutie i like and trust.

>>73033338
the only ugly "asian" is pajeets.
--- 73033369
>>73033349
>talks like a whoe
yeah even if I weren't ugly, I wouldn't want you.

>>73033362
you do know there's unattractive east asians and girls here wants the kpop asian aesthetics.
--- 73033397
>>73033369
i want a guy that looks similar to your typical old school otaku.

Incels have a more biased view of sex because they never had any and don't truly understand it.
Men in general have a biological tendency to prefer "purer" girls because that's the only way you can make sure the baby was yours. Of course we as humans don't act on the extreme of our biology so most men are ok and understand if you had some partners but the less the better.

>>73033283
Infidelity is a big one. Be loyal, that's the most important quality a woman can have. A man should be willing to kill and die to protect you and you should be willing to wait until he leaves prison after killing someone for you.
Men want respect so always make sure you respect your man, even more so in front of others. Something bad happened? Wait until you two go back home to talk about it and keep everything fine and lovely outside.
Everything else would be more relative and specific to your own husband but rarely ever do men leave their women. Understand that sex for men isn't the same for women so him having sex with some women outside isn't a big deal unless he is providing for her, as long as he always come back to you and you are his priority, there is nothing to worry about.

Go for it. There are a lot of new mmos releasing in 2023 so you can try a few of them and meet people that way.

>why do so many of you have trouble getting over your exes
Least sociopathic woman.
--- 73033562
>>73033227
Cut all contact with the ex and try to never encounter them again.

How can I tell if a male is joking in our rp/sexting or if he is actually getting off? How can I tell if he imagines me or some other female?
--- 73033776
>>73033692

Didn't ask. Don't care. Kys

That wasn't me anon.

>>73033692
If he wasn't satisfying himself in some way he would have probably stopped with the roleplay.
I assume the sexting is about you two and not a roleplay using characters, in that case he is in some way imagining you, maybe a more perfect version of you but still you in some capacity. That said, you shouldn't worry too much if he is imagining you or another female because he is doing it with you and not with someone else. When a men gives his time and attention to you it means he cares about you enough that he isn't out there giving it to some other woman.

>>73033851
>he cares about you enough that he isn't out there giving it to some other woman.
Well, he does have a girlfriend. I am the woman who's just been his long time simp when I am single. He won't date me for real.
--- 73034060
>>73033974
If he is spending more time with you than with the girls you still have a chance. Stop being available at all times for him and if he asks say you want to be in a committed relationship first.
I wouldn't go for a guy who does such a thing while having a girlfriend though.
--- 73034133
>>73033158
what do we incels do then?
--- 73034534
>>73034060
>If he is spending more time with you than with the girls you still have a chance. 
It is hard to say as he is long distance with both of us but we message a lot and call sometimes, usually on holidays or late at night.
--- 73034547
>>73032950
wrong, szpd. They're proper opposites given one has too much emotion and the other has none at all.
--- 73034592
>>73033974
>who's just been his long time simp when I am single
"I'm just gonna try to chase this chad when I'm done with whatever bf I'm on at the time"
--- 73035498
>>73034592
When i realize i am done i cut it off in short order. Leading someone on is cruel.
--- 73035693
>>73032881 (OP)
the only guy that flirted with me seemed mentally not all there. also crack heads compliment me sometimes, which, feels good man. why would a crack head lie? am i completely hopeless? men show literally zero interest in me. do i need to change something? do some reflecting?

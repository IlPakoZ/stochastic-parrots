Just got my appendix remove and we've never been more over. sorry I talk like a zoomer I'm only 18 but I've been on this shit hole for 5 years. I got my appendix removed and I'm stuck in my house more or less for a week and I can't work our for 4 weeks. Literally the last thing I could rely on to boost my mood. Life's been so shitty recently. Don't have enough community service hours to graduate yet and I don't have enough to go to prom not that I was going to go anyways. I was doing so good for a while in 2023. I hadn't drank for 4 months, started taking school more seriously, and most importantly took my health a lot more seriously. And while I gave up on school and started drinking alone again I could rely on working out and still eating well (besides smoking). But no. The last outlet in my life where I can put effort into without being miserable, and having my zoomer dopamine fried, hyper-reality accustomed brain lose attention has been stripped. The other day at work I lost my phone for a few hours

Can't do my hobbies because of an injury as well, was like the only thing I had going for me. Don't know why I'm still here honestly. Shit sucks. But I'm too much of a pussy to drink bleach so here I am. From a zoomer (though I'm a bit older) to another, cheers brother.

and I was so happy for a little bit. The worst addiction far and away was not alcohol but has been screens. I don't know if they've destroyed this generation but they've 100% destroyed me. I can barely focus on anything and nothing stimulates me. I used to read and writ books so far above my age and always impressed adults with how much I read and tried to write better but now it's fucking over. I would rather be addicted to heroin than use my phone. But I know because i'm so fucking addicted to screen and endless scrolling I can't get rid of it. When I tell my friends I just want to get rid of it and throw away my phone they call me retarded and say they wouldn't be able to reach me. I haven't seen them in a while and I've been getting more distant from everyone. but my screen times been going up. You can't get away from screens these days. Every single class requires you to have a laptop. No school work can be handed on paper anymore except in math class. Everything has to written on a shitty chrome book and uploaded online. They handed out the chrome books to the retards who couldn't write at first, but since covid they're practically mandatory in everything. When I say I hate this generation, I don't say it as "wahh I was born in the wrong generation because trannies, or no gf, or bad culture". No I wish I lived the internet because the information has ruined me. I don't understand how others cope. How do you guys manage to use screens without being horribly addicted and wasting your lives. I hate being this lonely. I feel so isolated. One of my only friends from discord (I try not to use it too much) recently completely left the internet for similar reasons and i'm considering doing the same. Back in early 2022 I deleted my email and had no internet presence to speak of except my school and work email. But that was too much. Even having a computer was too much. You can't put down the heroin needle without throwing out the heroin as well.

I fucking hate it. My mind and thoughts are so cloudy. I can't think clearly or properly ever. It's all just noise. Literal meaningless ramblings, single meaningless sentences I read being repeated by my brain. My brain literally tries to replicate scrolling or being online while i'm not using it. I just hate what I've turned myself into but i hate that society is almost forcing me here. Forcing me to use screens and be online. You know how hard it is to talk to people and make friends with no social media these days? Very fucking hard for zoomers. I've spent the past day watching awful animes that bring me no joy or playing videogames that are no longer fun. Sometimes when I go down to my computer I just end up switching between google earth, listening to a song for 30s, and then opening up a game which I look at for 5 seconds realise I don't want to play it and start the cycle all over again. I'm so addicted and I know it brings no happiness. There's no tangible benefit or good feeling like there is with drugs. Just and awful completely wasting addiction. Even alcohol doesn't really affect me that much anymore. Just makes me feel different. Not good or happy or emotional in any way. I just feel drunk and alone and continue to scroll. I was doing so good for a while and these past two months I have just seen myself fall off completely. It's so fucking over and we won't be back for a while. I can't even express my rage by working out or doing something physical. I just have to surrender to depression. I wasn't made to live in this hyper-reality. There's no way I can have a healthy relationship with the online world. I don't understand how everyone else isn't like this. it's like there's something wrong with me or everyone else uses their screens this much and somehow they don't see the problem. I'm going to take some opiates that I was prescribed for my post-op recovery. I love being in the worst physical pain of my life when my appendix was about to bu

I work out a lot (before surgery). I work out with a good split 5 times a week, and do a goofy little ab workout every day not so much to build core strength but more to build the discipline to do something everyday. I go explore the forest behind my house lots and last week my younger brother, cousin and I went out into the forest and just climbed cliffs for like 4 hours. But this surgery fucked me cause I can't do anything physical fro 4 weeks that's why it's over. I'm basically forced to be a cuck and lie down. Watch my gains wither away and be even more miserable as I stare at my phone.

Did you at least get to keep it in a jar? May we see it?

>screen addiction
Ironically, you being homebound is the perfect time to temper that. Set an alarm where you are not allowed to use the internet until it goes off. You're only allowed to do things like read or paint or talk to someone in person until then. Maybe watch a movie (not just youtube video shit unless they're all over 20 minutes long) so long as you don't do anything else at the same time. Want to at least play around and see what sort of approaches may work for you?

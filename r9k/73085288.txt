Why is the internet so boring now?
--- 73085460
not enough suffering
--- 73085518
because most people online are really REALLY hostile now for no reason. They also dox people a lot. Puts 2008 /b/ to shame desu

everything is five giant websites filled with screenshots of the other four, and everything you see on them is filtered through algorithms that are 90% profit maximization and 10% hiding the politically naughty content from you. the tiny corners where algorithmic enshittification has been avoided are filled with lunatics and degenerates. the most reasonable, kind and comfortable web community i've found lately is a forum that advocates and promotes painless suicide methods, and no i am not going to be foolish enough to advertise it

You're implying that you knew the time when the Internet was not boring. Were you not following along with all the "stuff" that's happened since then? Now things are different.

it's because everything is centralized. its not hard to avoid social media, but it's impossible to avoid the cultural zeitgiest that flows from it

You're just boring, don't project it onto the rest of us you fucking queef.

how about we increase the barrier?
i have one idea how to do it
--- 73086363
>>73086338
there are places on the internet with higher barrier to entry, certainly not this shithole.

Pick a more unique disqualifing factor next time, insult my lack of wealth, my social inability, my fucked up parents.
Oh wait!? does all that apply to you as well.
Well I'll be gosh golly darned. Guess neither of us are as unique and interesting as we thought.

Sit in your beige dunce hat sob story corner alone, I want no part in it. Keep acting beyond this life until you end up with tears falling into your weathered middle aged hands out on the street, nothing is more bland and pointless than people who jerk off their own banality.

i think the only way we're gonna have smart people one place without the dumbasses is if there's a legitimate benefit to going there.

honestly the one thing i'm missing the most in my life is having smart and responsive people around me that i can interact with share ideas with and learn from.

on 4chan you'll occasionally run into some smart person who actually responds to you but the wast majority of the time everything you post just gets ignored. the more effort you put into your post the higher the chance it will be ignored.

>>73086439
I'm so tired of the majority of 4chan posters at this point. Election tourists whos feeble brains have been fully subsumed by /pol/ vomit repeating the same exact things since 2016 has ruined this website
I think an imageboard where talk on race and gender was just banned for being the IQ sinks that they are would be ideal.

lets put it this way, lurking on dread, a forum filled with 60%+ drug addicts, has been a much better experience. somehow these people are able to hold intelligible discussion, because you need Tor to fucking access the site keeping the brainlets out. but because of this the site is dead so there isn't much entertaining to see for more than half an hour a day.

you're actively a negative actor against privacy initiatives insisting that "it's not real bro!!". there is no joke to take, you are subhuman and I have no respect for you and the actions you take to alter public consensus however small they might be.

Don't flip this on me you slippery gypsy, YOURE the one complaining about the banality of it all, all I did was point out the fact that you're discontentment is most probably internally generated(not a webwide phenomenon)
Keep projecting though, I'll act like a big white sheet and you can really let loose.

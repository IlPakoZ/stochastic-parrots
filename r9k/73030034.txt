you won't get far constantly othering people

Lucky reddit has that anti LARP technology to prevent any faggoty incels posting obvious false flags that hit every r9k popular talking point otherwise I might have suspected OP was (You) fishing.

That's really disgusting behavior, if your girl cannot hug and comfort you when you need it the most without feeling disgust towards you, she doesn't deserve you.

Do you really think any real women actually use Reddit. Ywnbaw

Imagine being a woman, you are already emotional yourself and are physically and mentally weaker then men, would you want to date a guy who fucking cries like a baby because he got bullied by other men and even women too? Do you really blame her for losing attraction? Like this isn't a teary eyed "oh my dad died" thing, this dude is straight up crying like a pussy over getting bullied in high school.

I absolutely fucking hate women so much its unreal
--- 73031610
not a problem as long as you just don't show vulnerability in front of women. it's really not hard to do, and when women say they want to see men show vulnerability and cry more often, it's just a shit test and you're supposed to ignore it

Do you retards genuinely believe these reddit posts? I feel like this is obvious rage bait. Surely no one is dumb enough to believe it?

This is so transparently a man trying to convert fence sitters to incel terrorists, it didn't work it just makes people hate incels more for being whiner loser pussies. Man up and end it.

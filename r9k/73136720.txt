Making non-normie friends in the collectivist shit hole of Italy is impossible. Everyone's hobbies always gravitate towards the same trite and shallow shit: kickball, netflix and hanging by the bar

You are meetings normies in normie places and expecting them to not be normies.

I have a different experience where I live. I got a job recently and the ratio of normies to non normies is like 50%. Half the people there are PC gamers, are into stuff like warhammer, non-mainstream music. Etc. Theyre still somewhat normies because you wont meet true weird non-normies in normie places like a 9-5 job.

If you want to be friends with non-normies you have to meet them in their spaces. Like World of warcraft or some shit. Then become online friends and transition to real life friends. Its not that hard its 2023. You can make friends with people online. Be sure to do your due diligence though, make sure theyre not a sociopath

slightly unrelated but i fuckin hate when people call watching netflix a hobby. how did you make a streaming platform with its shitty limited selection a part of your personality?

If collecting stamps and Pokemon cards can be hobby then why isn't consooming crap on TV can't be one.

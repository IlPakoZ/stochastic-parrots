it's another night, still can't sleep, still here posting. still a neet with no job, no degree and no gf. still feel like shit. still getting the chest pains.

I'm tired of this sad life, but I can't do anything to change it. I just can't make myself happy. I tried taking it easy and relaxing. I tried to going out more, I started going to a japanese course and a gym. I tried going to therapy. I just don't know what else I can do. I'm still trying things but nothing really works. maybe it's too late for me idk.

tell me anons, is it too late for me to get a better life?

If you don't enjoy living, kill yourself, simple as

Nah, but you sound seriously weary. Time fixes most things, but we have less time than we think. Maybe you could meme yourself into finding purpose in the poitnless grind, absurdism. I have nothing left so that's what I do.

B-but everyone says this will pass and they're probably right, the nature of life is transitory...

I wouldn't say it's too late. I'm not smart enough to specifically explain how, but there's gotta be a way to fix things.
I just worry that even then, you'd still be depressed.

idk, it feels like late
>there's gotta be a way to fix things.
even if there is a way, it wouldn't matter if I can't find it.
>I just worry that even then, you'd still be depressed.
maybe idk, this last few years have been very difficult for me. all I want is some peace. I doubt that I'll ever find it but since I'm still alive, I might as well try.

if you get a job what is going to change? now youre just a sad neet with less free time.

probably there are gonna be changes but nothing for the better. I'd rather stay a neet than working a shitty job.

Problem with neetdom is it almost always gets the bad ending. Problem with wageslaving is it too almost always gets the bad ending. We should be demanding 4 day work weeks and revolting against tech and AI, but we all know that won't work either uhhhh

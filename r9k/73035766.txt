God adores the prideful, courageous and arrogant. God loves those who are sure. God rewards the violent, the self-confident and the gutsy.

God hates the meek, shy and fearful. God loathes those who are second-guessing. God punishes the cowardly, the sensitive and the weak.

God hates you.

I am extremely lucky, it's almost supernatural. If God doesn't love me someone sure as hell does.

God sends the meek and cowardly to the outer darkness where they belong. God only has room for the couragous in His kingdom.

yeah. it really does seem like that. our intuitive sense of justice must be wrong if god condones this world

god is more competent than us. god knows better. and he rewards the best things in life to the most evil, by our definition. and this world is good, because god made it, and god felt inclined on making it, instead of not making it

>God hates you.
god must be merciful, without a doubt, because god could just torture us ruthlessly. you have to admit that this could be worse. your life could be noticeably worse. the fact that you dont have it worse, i think is some evidence against god being evil

and god does seem to love the cruel, the prideful, the strong. this is why i throw away all my instictual feelings of right and wrong in the trash, because im simply not competent enough to judge

its just depressing to be born a trashcan to be kicked and throw away, for someone else. makes me wonder why

what a cruel god, loving some , and making others to be a punching bag

all revelatory religions are retarded
they have supernatural claims which cannot be reasonable to believe in

like the resurrection, or turning water to wine, or angels who cast fireballs or whatever

those are lies or delusions. they are not reasonable to believe in. you have to be a moron to believe these unjustified claims

i believe in god, and i think the arguements for god are strong

i just dont believe in revelatory religions. you strawman'd me. you assumed i was an anthiest. im not an athiest, you retard

i believe in god, but i dont believe in relevatory religions like islam or christianity. you have to be retarded to believe that shit

>people can be resurrected from the dead and water can be turned into wine... BECAUSE SOME GUY 2000 YEARS AGO SAID SO, OKAY

I wouldn't try and dodge the draft. Can you say the same?

> god is real but he doesn't tell us to do anything or provide any moral guidance on how to live our lives or meaningfully interact with or appear to care about us at all

how are you functionally different from an atheist again
--- 73036171
>>73036144
the fuck has a draft got to do with anything. getting shot cos the government told you to is just as meek as washing the feet of lepers...meeker in fact because no one's telling you to wash leperfeet

Is it meek to accept the responsibility to go fight and risk death for a country you love, or is it meek to shirk away from it and hide away like a little rat?

You definitely would.
--- 73036280
>>73036216
only a meek pussy thinks he has any higher responsibility than himself, his own pleasure, and the screams and lamentations of his personal enemies and those weak enough to be an easy target. you haven't volunteered for the wagner group and you haven't gleefully smashed any meek Ukie heads in with a sledgehammer, because you are a coward bound by slave morality, just like any other draftee

>how are you functionally different from an atheist again

??????????????

i believe in god. i also believe you ought behave morally, i believe in objective morals. how i come to know what is moral is something i cannot say. i reject my intuive feelings on morals, because i dont think its justified to believe in. i cant say what is and isnt moral, but that doesnt mean i dont believe in objective morals

>you're functionally the same as an athiest
ahh, so you dont care for people's belief in god, you just want them to join your ass backwards revelatory religion, where kid's dick skin is cut off, have a casual animal sacrifice, and slavery is endorsed?

how are you functionally different than cult followers of some hallucinating psycho who fucks all of the women and abuses people?
--- 73036381
>>73036344
an atheist thinks he has to figure out morality on his own. so do you. any difference is just aesthetic handwaving
--- 73036507
>>73036381
>an atheist thinks he has to figure out morality on his own
atheists waver over their belief in objective morality. some do, some dont. you are strawmanning me by saying im the same as atheists

also, that is true of you as, as well. whatever fucking revelatory religion you believe in, its because you had to figure it out. this is inescapeably true, you fucking retard

holy FUCK you are stupid. you had to use your reason, sense of intuition and feelings to judge what is true or not, to judge if your religion is true or not. this is true of athiests or thiests

you FUCKING MORON

awwwwwwwwwwwww???????

cant use your regular comebacks to me, because i believe in god, but dont believe in your kid dick cutting off, slavery endoring religion?

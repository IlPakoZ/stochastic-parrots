Could be better, been struggling quite a bit lately but I will make it. I assume the food you have there on your plate is good... What is it?

It's past 9pm so I'm eating quite late but I think I'm gonna go cook something. I'll probably do some pigs in blankets in a nice sauce. What exactly are you eating?

A Mediterranean fish plate. I helped my aunt out with building a few things in her house and my parents left me some of their dinner. Got back, greeted them and went upstairs after a bit while making tea.

Nice, sounds very comfy. I only played the first one and it made me realize I have zero artistic talent, I can't paint something half decent to save my life and there are likely color blind people out there with more sense of which colors go together than me.

it's going fine, ate some cereal that i heated up in the microwave to make soggy but those fries on your plate just gave me the urge to eat fries.
>>73055054
soggy fries > crispy fries

>>73054994 (OP)
I'm literally going to throw up.

That opinion should absolutely be made illegal, I can't believe the Geneva Convention would allow somebody to say that.
--- 73056193
>>73056117
>soggy fries > crispy fries
how wrong you are
--- 73056260

>Geneva Convention
"The Geneva Conventions are rules that apply only in times of armed conflict and seek to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilities; these include the sick and wounded of armed forces on the field, wounded, sick, and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea, prisoners of war, and civilians." no war times soldier

I never understood people that like crispy fries, I only got crispy fries and cried because I was so hungry.

Simply declaring something so obscene is itself an act of war upon all of humanity.

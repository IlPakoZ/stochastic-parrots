marrying after 30 is as risky as marrying in your teens. the only good time to marry is mid 20s after dating for 5 or 6 years, as per all the evidence.

which means if you didn't meet your lifelong partner by 21 its OVER simple as.

Why are poorfags not simply taking the money they need from a bank vault? Is it some kind of weird LARP?

It looks like shes just burning through all her husbands money on stupid shit she doesn't need. 

the only thing that bitch can manage is her hair.

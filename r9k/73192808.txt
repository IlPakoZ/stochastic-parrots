Therapy is just being reconditioned to accept the situation.

Therapy does not mean that the situation isn't real or that i am wrong to express myself the way that i am.

I refuse therapy because society should make the proper changes, not me.
There is nothing wrong with me rejecting this hedonistic shithole society of people.

I did in college. It was a bad decision. They just put you on shitty drugs with bad side effects that don't even help.

Because the mental health system is punitive, especially for men.

>Tell therapist about your depression
>Therapist baker acts you
>Police forcibly take you to the retard bin
>Force literal poison down your throat and throw you in a colorless padded room
>Delirious from the poison, nothing to do but nothing, no sense of self, no sense of anything remotely making you human
>Slowly go insane over the course of the 72 hour hold
>Pharmaroastie comes around and determines you can leave
>Leave even more fucked up than you came in

This is the modern mental health system.

I agree with a lot of the critiques here, but therapy can be helpful if the therapist is a man. I found a guy who didn't bullshit, told me directly how I was self-sabotaging and why. No attempt to justify or diminish my behaviour, just explaining why it was harmful and how to change it. The best therapists are basically just strong father figures, since most male dysfunction comes from a deficient or absent father.

Giving my hard earned money to a soft cunt who sits in a chair for a living is not going to make me any happier.

Jesus, the text on that hits a little too close to home. I'm going to hide the thread instead of taking it as a sign that I should try therapy.

I had therapy forced on me as a child, briefly. It's a meme (just like 99.9% of mental illnesses). It's used as an excuse for normies to try and placate people with actual problems.
>Child: wow, my life is really bad. Look at this list of problems.
>Parents: Oh wow. That would take a lot of effort to fix. Some of these things can't be fixed. Wait...I know - You have depression! We can give you an SSRI and you'll shut up

Same thing stopping me from doing literally everything I'm just extremely lazy. I make the appointment and don't feel like going. I probably have at least a thousand in debt from no showing doctors appointments. I think I will go do something and then the day comes and I'd rather stay home, nothing has been able to force me to do something I don't want to do it's pathetic

I know pretty much exactly how to fix myself. Lose a bunch of weight, get more sleep, spend free time on other human beings and fulfilling hobbies rather than anxiously scrolling my phone. I don't need to pay someone God knows how much fucking money to tell me that - I need a way to coerce myself into actually following through.

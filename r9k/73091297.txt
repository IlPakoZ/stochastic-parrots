why is the avarage 4chan couple like this
--- 73091877
i dunno but that sounds like 4 femanons i know
--- 73091890
>>73091297 (OP)
would be perfect if she wasn't woke and he wasn't extroverted
--- 73091913
So all the incels on here who whine about no gf and being shunned from dating

this is what they're angry about missing out on?
--- 73091927
>>73091913
if there is sex then yeah, i want some
--- 73091979
>>73091927
you realize they only use that to keep you pacified while they mistreat and walk all over you
--- 73092040
>>73091979
We mistreat them during sex so it cancels out
--- 73092109
>>73091979
if they're dominant in the relationship then it's a bonus. it's just that i live with my parents so my life isn't compatible with them
--- 73092270
>>73091913
Incels have a communist tier IQ on average 
They are willing to pretend that they would take the normalpill in order for le sex but then when the time comes to take the pill they shit themselves, convulse on the floor, do a front flip and throw the pill down their fucking windpipe because they would rather die then give up their hikineet incel lifestyle (sensible) but still want the benefits of a normie lifestyle (faggotry) 
They are incels because they never got sex and they never got sex because they are incels

Isnt this most couples these days?
--- 73092439
>>73091297 (OP)
>every 7+/10 guy has a soft harem due to tinder etc. 
>every guy 1-6/10 has to get into a knife fight for an average gf 

Op's image is the result. The bar for women is so fucking low it's insane. I don't think 'tutorial mode' even cuts it anymore.

zoomer (22)
>was a khhv before
>has no other friends
>can't manage to be an adult and pay rent on time
>calm temperament
>autism
>good at art

millenial (28)
>extroverted, but extremely misanthropic at the same time
>has friends, dislikes most of them
>ADHD temperament
>former "bad boy"
>even better at music
--- 73093171
>>73093125
>>has friends, dislikes most of them
why are they your friends
--- 73093187
>>73093125
>>was a khhv before
>>has no other friends
how did you """find""" one of these
--- 73093199
>>73093171
seems like he's just used to them since his childhood.
--- 73093200
>>73091979
Once sexbots hit the market, we will finally be free.
Please, stem lads, your brothers need you more than ever.
--- 73093214
>>73091297 (OP)
Because they date high schoolers, next question.
--- 73093228
>>73093214
Where else are we supposed to try to find virgins
--- 73093240
>>73093187
that's me. and he approached me irl. he stood out because I was still in my awkward tomboy phase at that point, and wasn't used to getting approached at all.
--- 73093257
>>73093228
Then it's a choice and you deserve it. Have fun at hot topic.
--- 73093280
>>73091297 (OP)
I have a gf like this except for the fact that she keeps me in a chastity cage
--- 73093289
>>73093240
>>73093125
>woman in relationship with her bf whos 5> older than her posting in r9k
everytime
--- 73093310
>>73093289
Is that a bad thing ? But yeah I guess it's common if you're in the "mentally ill enough to regularly post on 4chan" category of women
--- 73093312
>>73093125
lol what also sucks is that you're probably barely fuckable
--- 73093347
>>73093312
I get a lot more male attention these days so I disagree. But I think neither of us is a 9/10 either ngl
--- 73093402
>>73093310
its just tiresome seeing the same kind of people plaguing this place
>>73093347
women always get male attention easily
doesnt matter if youre fat or ugly
--- 73093430
>>73093289
It could easily be her best option, and if that's the case there's nothing to criticize because she's doing the best for herself.

>>73093347
I bet that you could lower that rating more. Thirsty men have very low standards, and if you were really that attractive, you would not be here posting.
--- 73093494
>>73093402
i have had men who are more attractive than my bf trying to get my attention, but I'm never leaving because he went for me when I was at my worst (the awkward tomboy phase)
--- 73093515
>>73093494
that had nothing to do with my point
women always get male attention no matter what
--- 73093522
>>73092439
You're right. At this point its dev mode with console commands in a sandbox for in-house alpha testing, and your project lead has told you do what you want I'm checked out just check your hours at the end of the week or you're not getting paid.
--- 73093530
>>73093494
did you just started dating your bg 8 days ago
--- 73093531
>>73093515
you're having an argument by yourself
--- 73093541
>>73093530
I just have a folder of 4 or 5 pictures I use every time I post
>tfw it's obvious i have no friends
--- 73093544
>>73091297 (OP)
Who drew this?
ORiginal post
--- 73093566
I feel like the guy who made this OP post/meme got dumped by a kid and wrote "deserves better" no shit a teenage zoomer GF is gonna lack in ADULT WOMAN skills and personality traits, at the end of the day she wins and he loses because he is a pedo moid and it will taunt him forever, as for legal 20+ zoomers being this way that's almost rare and they go to older guys for a reason, to feed on them. and they still win.

>>73093541
>same filename
feel sorry for your bf now
--- 73093659
>>73091297 (OP)

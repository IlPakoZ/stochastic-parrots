Like its just a bunch of zany personalities under 1 roof right? I hope theres not obv manufactured drama

>>73007987
Yeah you can donate money to pull wacky hijinks. There's one for something like $500 to get someones bed taken away for the night. I'm not going to donate any money but someone else probably will. It'll be funny to see the torture neet crypto whales will put these people through.

Just watch the highlights. Unless you have a lot of money, it'll be boring as fuck
--- 73009586
>needs e-mail
I'm out and I don't feel like making a burner account.
--- 73009651
>>73009576
>Unless you have a lot of money, it'll be boring as fuck
ca you elaborate? are you allowed to buy shit that fucks with the people in the fish tank or what? it doesn't work for me so i don't know
--- 73009726
>>73007968 (OP)
>you can only pay for like 5 "effects"
who thought this was a good idea? Seems like that will get boring fast. 
I TURNED UP THE HEAT AGAIN GUYS LOLOLO

>website is kinda garbage
>its not actually entertaining to watch 5 people who dont know each other shuffle around awkwardly for hours
even the highlights so far are completely uneventful. 
>sam is constantly grifting you for money while your on the website and everything is behind a paywall

the idea is kinda cool. the execution and result seem pretty poor.
--- 73009798
>>73009651
Yes. This is the menu. 100 tokens = $10
--- 73009832
>>73009798
the menu is honestly wack as hell and p lame. also expensive as fuck. 
I am surprised about how lame it is desu

assumed they were going to be literally torturing these guys
--- 73009886
>>73009832
Yeah it's possible there is something I don't know about yet, I just found out about this like an hour ago and started looking into it. I can't even find an FAQ or anything. It's super easy and convenient to enter your credit card info though :)))

It says the host will be arriving in 20 minutes to explain the show. I'm sure over time they will add different items to the token menu. Do you want to see the contestant bios?
--- 73009919
>>73009886
I got an account, so I can see the bios myself actually. Thanks for the offer though. 

Didnt think about the potential of them adding new things to the menu. Maybe it will end up getting spicy then. 

I sure as hell would never pay $170 to turn off the heat to a couple strangers house though. Like holy shit. 
If thats the price for mundane innocent prank, something spicy is gonna be the down payment on a car.

The joke is that the viewers are the ones who are getting pranked. Sam and Jet will have a big reveal about how everything was scripted and MDE fans will call them genius.
--- 73009952
>>73009886
>Do you want to see the contestant bios?
Yes

Fuck off Jet

From initial looks, there are 3 females and 5 males. Only 4 bedrooms with 7 beds between the lot of them. So somebody is sleeping on the couch unless they're going to share.

Simmons is the oldest and the only one who appears to not be from North America. Violetta was from Canada, the rest are American
--- 73010023
There is a sign on the wall that says STAY INSIDE NO WEED so it looks like they aren't allowed to leave and no drugs.
--- 73010042
>>73010023
>no drugs
i was hoping someone would have to be administered narcan but i guess i'll settle for watching them have withdrawal seizures
--- 73010045
Josie is the youngest. In fact every woman is younger than every man.
--- 73010057

Sylvia's looking a little deformed desu
--- 73010060
I haven't seen anybody pull out a cellphone or a laptop so I am assuming they don't have any electronics. They have some board games and puzzles laid around. There appears to be a TV but it is turned off, not sure what kind of service it has.
--- 73010078
I just noticed the kitchen has a gas stove. How many fires do you think are going to be started?
--- 73010118
Vance seems to be the most normie.
The house is 2 stories. Appears to be 2 bathrooms (no cameras in bathrooms). 1 car garage with only some trash bags and a ladder. I think they are trash bags of torn up carpet, they must have just added the wood flooring. No backyard it seems. All windows have opaque shades on them, no way to see outside.
--- 73010153
Last contestant Daniel.
It appears each contestant was allowed to bring a backpack and 1 large travel case. Apparently one of the guys forgot to bring deodorant.
--- 73010174
>>73009798
im guessing the items on this list will change they probably have a list of ideas somewhere
--- 73010179
>>73009994
They have decided on sleeping arrangements. Occasionally a pop up will appear where you vote for different options, you can also submit your own option to be voted on.
Voting costs 1 token. It says your token is refunded if your selection does not win.

>>73010060
if they allowed phones or laptops the show would be very boring because literally nothing would happen at all. i fucking hate technology.
--- 73010384
I just found out Sam is cybersquatting the "SNL" instagram address. I wonder how many hundres of millions he demanded to sell it to them.
--- 73010621
>>73010078
Yeah not very long
--- 73010651
>>73010384

I wonder if Sam has already fucked that one with the glasses.
--- 73010811
email verification still doesn't work
--- 73010835
pieces of shit are they trying to run their own mail server or what are they retarded fuck this thing
--- 73011118
The website is a disaster. Can't register even if I wanted to, shits fucked. Dead in the water internet show only a few people will watch and fewer will remember.
--- 73011188
>Mfw I have known one of these people for years now on discord
>they even browse this board
--- 73011228
>>73011118
they should have added a captcha to signup, i bet its getting spammed... must be a database issue
--- 73011274
>>73007968 (OP)
it's going to end soon once people find the house and start swatting it and/or they tell the guests about Sam and Marky
--- 73011292
Yeah that's a dude dude. Dude looks like a lady
--- 73011577
>>73011228
fucking amateurs imo
--- 73011656

--- 73011696
>>73011656
just watch it on vlc https://rentry.org/zte8w
--- 73011720
no camera in the bathroom? they're just going to jerk off in there so you can't see.
--- 73011729
why does everyone have so many pieces of paper
--- 73011741
>>73011729
they got assigned homework - they have to write an essay
--- 73011745
and why are they allowed to watch tv fuck that they should have sex and then fight to the death
--- 73011787
Anyone remember the threads of people sharing random unsecured video cameras?
--- 73011796
are they allowed to have sex?
--- 73011804
>>73011796
if they can't have sex there's no point
--- 73011812
>>73011787
i think those are still pretty common if you know how to search for them (ie: shodan)
--- 73011836
sam is too much of an angry dingus to them in his intro. they're going to be too scared to destroy the house. 

personally i would have left a bag of adderal and some dildos and porn.
--- 73011855
is there a perk you can buy to play some sound effect on a loop for 24 hours i would just submit the audio from some glurk glurk glurk shit
--- 73011865
God they are all so autistic, I didnt know about this, this might be fun to watch. Sam knows how to make content. This is the kind of shit Ice should of done if he wasnt actually low IQ.

Just give everyone their own mic pack

Thank you anons. I believe tomorrow will be a terrible day for me as I am going to bomb an exam I barely studied for. As usual, it is only at the last moments that I feel regret for my actions (or inaction, in this case). Fuck procrastination fr ;-; ugh why the fuck am I so useless and stupid and keep making bad decisions fuck I hate myself

You'll be fine. Study more for the next one.

>>73062914
You're right, actually. I'm not exactly out of chances yet. Oh well, panicking now will get me nowhere.

try doing something intrinsically rewarding before studying, whenever I'm procrastinating I'm usually really bored and do stuff which isn't enjoyable like phonescroll which makes me procrastinate more. Good luck on that exam

I'm not sure if that will work; anything I do that is not the task I need to do ends up being procrastination - though I do feel better procrastinating by reading a book or playing the piano instead of scrolling.

I read through Atomic Habits today (as a form of procrastination, of course) and I'm hoping it'll make some sort of difference in my life, but I'm not too hopeful at the prospect of some self-help book saving my life.

I completely understand how you feel because I have been having issues with procrastination and failing exams ars a result, i wanna say, give it a shot regardless, you never know, at times you get lucky, as soon as you are done, maybe take 2 or 3 days to relax, and after that, make it a point to study 2 to 4 hours every single day so that it doesn't happen again, I know it isn't easy to do when you are depressed and you feel bad on a daily basis, but I believe in you Anon, let's both get our degrees!

Atomic habits has some good advice but it isnt really a good book. Read it and thought it was shit. Better to watch a youtube video about procastination if you ask me.

Its ok to fail. Many are afraid of it, but one failure doesnt really much, just do better next time. Remember, procrastination is a hard monster to beat. Just take it step by step and be patient with yourself

Thanks anon for reminding me that there's still a next time. I feel ashamed for failing so much (I've failed an EMBARRASSING amount of times) but as long as I'm still alive and kicking I guess there's still a next time! Let us get our degrees, indeed!

>>73062999
What didn't you like about the book, anon?

I think one of the best strategies for me to give myself motivation is just reading a motivational book or seeing a motivational video. A book or video telling me what to do is a great way for me to get myself pumped up for any task! I just need to make accessing those resources regularly a habit. Maybe I should install some motivational quote dispenser like I see so many people doing.

Anon, I hate to tell you this, but it's been a lot more than one failure I've gone through... I'm an actual, genuine disappointment to my parents. Which is why I feel terrible for failing yet again. (Though I haven't actually failed this course YET, technically.) I wish I was a better student, a better person. I thank you for your response, though! You are right. I will continue taking the steps I need to reach my goals, even if it is discouraging watching "normal" students proceeding at a normal pace. I will make it out alive!

Reading through the textbook now, the content doesn't seem as scary to me as it did a few weeks earlier. I wish I didn't have to rely on an approaching deadline to convince me to crack open my textbook. Oh well. I hope I don't do the thing where I get too scared to study next time. Next time, huh...

Sorry for the late reply, i had to do some chores, i literally wasted almost 3 years in university because i was extremely depressed and i could not focus on studying at all, it's ok to fail Anon, it really is trust me, the only thing that truly matters is being able to get out of that mind state so that you can actually get stuff done, i've recently fixed my depression and i've been able to do 3 exams in the time lapse of 4 months, which is something i had never been done to do, there is still hope for you, i believe in you.
Like i said, just make sure to study a tiny bit every single day and you'll be mostly fine, even when attending classes, i just download the textbooks on my phone and study between a class and the other.

Thank you for your reply, anon.

Don't even mention it, i can't help myself from trying to help, i don't want you to suffer because of it as well.

Atomic habits gives you inspirational stories and markets you how buying this book will not make you regret. I already bought the book, it doesnt need to keep advertising the book through the book. I want to get straight to the point, how do i make these atomic habits and what are good example strategies? Book has some of it, but not enough. Some videos in youtube are better

Damn, this inspired me as well. Im a chronic procrastinator for about 3 years. Been surviving by cheating online classes but now it has bitten me in the ass. Gotta study a little everyday like you said

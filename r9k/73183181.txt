I'm getting sick of seeing the doubters of penis enlargement. All the proof, all the evidence, they just deny it and refuse to accept it. It's almost funny at this point.

Penis Enlargement works.
>NO IT DOESN'T THERE'S NO PROOF
there is countless photographic proof
>NOPE FAKE PICS
but there are literally scientific studies showing that people wearing a penis extender for 6 months gain
>IT WILL MAKE YOUR ERECTION WEAKER
the people in the studies had improved erections and urologists give traction devices to men with erectile dysfunction
>JELQING WILL FUCK UP YOUR DICK
Jelqing is considered outdated and injury prone, nobody does it anymore besides retards, the riskiest exercise people do is clamping
>OK SO WHAT IF IT WORKS THE RISKS ARE TOO GREAT
depends on if you think that risk is worth it, you also might ruin your spine lifting weights
>BUT IF IT WORKED EVERYONE WOULD HAVE 10 INCH DICKS
do you really think everyone is autistic enough to hang weights from their dicks and pump their cocks 8 hours a day for years to gain 2 inches? most people can't even go to a fucking gym once a week

PE should stay secret. We don't need it getting popular and normies doing it like they did with lifting, and every woman raising her standards. I shill against PE whenever I see it brought up because I don't want 6" normies hanging and pumping up to 7.5" like I did.

The problem with PE is that not only is it risky but the guys that are already big have the most to gain. If you're 3", you're not going to PE up to 6". But if you're 6", you can get up to 7.5". The more dick you have the easier it is. It's good for an average dick guy if he wants to gamble his dick on becoming hung. And if you get a venous leak or tunica tear it's all over. For a baby dick, you're basically fucked at that point.

And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, adorned as a bride for her bridegroom...

And the one seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new. Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true." Then he said to me, "Is it done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water from the spring of life without cost..." 

Then the angel showed me the river of life, bright like a crystal, flowing from the throne of God and the Lamb of God. On either side of the river is the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits. Nothing anathema will be found there anymore, but the throne of God and the Lamb will be there, and his servants shall see him face to face, and he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, for death will be no more, neither will there be mourning or crying, and there will be no more pain, for the old things have passed away. 

Then he said, "Behold, I am coming quickly! And I will repay each according to their works. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Blessed are those who wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb, they will inherit the right to the tree of life and the holy city. But outside are dogs, sorcerers, the sexually immoral, murderers, idolaters, and all who practice falsehood. It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you with the testimony for the Churches. I am the root and descendant of David, the bright morning star. Surely, I am coming quickly! Amen."

Amen. Thank you brother for this passage, I'm feeling a bit sad today but that is okay, for someday, all things will be made anew, but it seems that until that day, we just have to endure it

Indeed. Trials are good, they build you up spiritually. As Jesus said, "In this world you will have troubles, but take courage! I have overcome the world." Know that one day, there will be true justice for all in the end! God will render to each according to their deeds.

There is only one person worthy of our devotion. Set aside these false idols, OP. Worship our Queen, Saint Iris.

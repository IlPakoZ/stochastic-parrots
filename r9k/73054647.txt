I was golfing with my supervisor and then he started saying "Watch me land this hole in one". So I jokingly responded, "Man, if you land a hole in one, I'll suck your dick." to which he immediately and repulsively replied "Eww."

Goddammit I was trying to sound like that one guy at the start of Wolf of Wall Street who tells Jordan "If you can sell $10000 worth of this stock, I'll suck your dick. And I want it to happen by the way." Instead my supervisor was immediately repulsed by my display of faggotry. Maybe I sounded too serious like I really would suck his dick. I mean come on, what were the chances he'd actually land a hole in one? It was just a joke.

Fuck man. I might have ruined my job and lost my golfing buddy with this shit. What are the best ways to invest in killing yoursel from cringe overload?

What did you expect in a war where third world country attacks its neighbour?

Anyone who deals with Russia gets used to disappointment. They aren't even as strong as they were 40 years ago and we beat them then without a single B-52.

I don't remember a single conflict 40 years ago with a side that had B52. Or any big wars, apartfrom some shit in mudslime countries.

Well it is like saying"without using space lasers" - it only adds confusion as there were no wars where opposition even possessed such a thing.

>why aren't wars like my videogames 
Mitts spent 20 years taking tax-paid vacations in Afghanistan, at least Ukraine has some action going on

If anon said
>no space lasers
There wouldn't have been confusion.

They want to avoid a WW3, not speedrun their way into one.

Perhaps a war is what world needs. At least it would either cure or kill countries infested with lgbt, rapefugee/nigger worshippers.

B52 is a meme anyway, Ruskie gave Nam some SAM and they got shot down like shit

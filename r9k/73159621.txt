Make shrimp po'boys with homemade remoulade next. You can use frozen breaded shrimp if you're lazy.

Or make frozen pierogis with kielbasa, and fried onions. And applesauce and sour cream on the side. And potato lakes if you're ambitious.

Cooking is fun, if you have your own car to go to the grocery as much as you want than its even better. I ran out of motivation to cook because I don't have a car and the closest grocery is a 45 minute walk (total time there and back), but if that wasn't an issue I would have continued

I'm learning to accept the uselessness of my balls and urging my Mistress to castrate me and cook up my jewels in a cast iron pan so I can watch her eat them

I'm sorry to hear that you're frustrated with the way people communicate with you. Is there anything in particular you'd like to talk about?

there's not much exactly i can say, though i appreciate the offer anon. im just so angry that i can't hold normal conversations with people without getting extremely confused or upset over minor things. i really don't get how to properly socially interact, even with close friends and my partner. why can't people just be upfront and confrontational when talking rather than being cryptic for the sake of fucking with me or trying to use retarded hints rather than just speaking like a normal fucking person

I am sorry to hear that you are struggling with social interaction. It can be challenging to navigate social situations, but there are strategies that can be helpful. Have you tried learning more about communication and active listening skills? There are many resources available online or through counseling services that can teach you how to navigate conversations and communicate effectively.

Additionally, it may be helpful to have a conversation with the people in your life about your struggles with social interaction. You may find that they are willing to communicate more clearly and directly with you once they understand your challenges. Remember that it is okay to ask for help and support when you need it.

i haven't, though I'm not sure how useful they'd be. the way people talk is just so perplexing to me sometimes its really hard to make sense of it.

ive been meaning to try that, but id feel bad imposing on them to conform to my needs and im not sure if they'd even change... it doesn't help that my two favorite people are inherently people that talk in a rather odd way, being short/cryptic in how they speak

>>72985356 (OP)
How do they speak to you, anon?
--- 72985770
>>72985739
they like to speak in short/cryptic sentences to both tease me or sometimes unintentionally making me worry. then sometimes they'll imply things i don't understand and have to ask about making a fool of myself

then sometimes they'll just ghost or say they're leaving suddenly mid conversation which makes me worry more than anything

>my partner
aaaand i'm out

>>72985685
Yeah, normalfags tend to do this. Im forced to too since they hate it if youre too upfront about it, even though its the same message youre saying
--- 72985825
>>72985770
Fuck, OP. They do the same with me! Its so frustrating. Why do these normalfags do this?
--- 72985862
>>72985685
>my partner
>close friends
Shit, i did say i could relate and then
--- 72985863
>>72985809
>>72985825
yeah, its fucking irritating and i genuinely don't get the point to it. makes talking to any of them feel like an uphill sprint
--- 72985873
>>72985685
>close friends
My empathy for you is dwindling
--- 72985878
>>72985862
its no worry anon, i didn't expect much advice from this board anyway, i was just kinda rageposting. somehow despite the fact that i got extremely blessed and lucky for a sperg with all these great people around me i still can't find myself to be happy or satisfied with my interactions with them , its pretty pathetic

>>72985863
There are always wrong answers with normiefags, even though they reassure you before that you cant offend them
--- 72985910
>>72985878
Its okay, anon. Everbody has the right to complain and rage about things. Just feels weird hearing it from someone with close friends and a partner since it sounded like you would be the the who would have none of those. Youre pretty blessed that youre surrounded by nice people. That or youre tall, handsome, and financially stable and that automatically means youre loved
--- 72985947
>>72985910
yeah, for years i was pretty much by my lonesome and pretty much fine with that, then in the span of 9 months or so, i had a very loving partner and one of the most genuine helpful caring people ive ever met plant themselves in my life basically entirely on their own. it's one of the greatest blessings ive ever had, but im still trying to adjust to dealing with people like this to be honest and it feels like an inevitability im going to end up losing them due to my incapability to socialize.

Nah, youre good, anon. I think she knows that as well about being a fucking autist. Live the good life and penetrate the normie society

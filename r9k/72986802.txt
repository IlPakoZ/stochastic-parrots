Why don't you like fitness?
Why do you partake in being a lazy slob?

The only thing that matters is your face, fitness is pure copium.

Going to the gym won't make me tall.

No reason to work out when you don't even go outside. Also,

It's pointless self harm. The only benefit is increased strength which is entirely unnecessary for most of the population including myself

Even if this were true (It's not), being strong has so many benefits it's hard to think of when you wouldn't want it.

when the average incel is this retarded it's no wonder women are repulsed by them

I don't like sweating and I see no point in it since >>72987046. I'm skinny and can lift heavy stuff when I need to, what more would I want?

>>72988252
No, you don't understand. You NEED to waste time and energy picking things up and putting them down so you can... uh... beat up a robber when he comes into the house that you never leave!
--- 72988355
>>72988342
Imagine being proud of being weak.
--- 72988598
Because I'd still be incel anyway. Therefore there is no point.
This applies to almost everything, by the way.

It's mainly to attract women who like the ability that muscles project(physical self defense during home invasion being one of them)....but you clearly wouldn't know anything about attracting women.

You're actually stupid, right? Being fit means being even more horny 24/7. Fuck that

I only care about mantaining physical wellbeing so I take long walks, do pull ups, jump rope. I'm uninterested in bodybuilding because I'm a 5'4 manlet anyway. Sports are off limits because I have weirdly slow/disfunctional reflexes and I can't even catch a ball or aim a throw.

>>72990163
Wtf you say? Manlets are the best in bodybuilding, since muscularity doesn't scale linearly with height, manlets look more massive having the same amount of muscle.
--- 72990212
exercise is great but I usually get depressed in the winter and stop
--- 72990217
>>72986802 (OP)
The amounts of copium being consoomed in this thread are massive
--- 72990228
>>72990194
Yes but what's the point? Being big and juicy is not going to fix my life. I did gym 3 years, I know.
--- 72991091
if dubs I'll have muscular or at least fit wife

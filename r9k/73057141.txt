if you are serious about this, then just learn to make your own soap. it will help you see not only how cheap &amp; easy soap is to make, but also how all that fancy shit is purely decoration &amp; potentially harmful.
t. have been making my own soap for 5+ years

I didn't watch the video, but guessing based on the title that it's a good place to start. To make soap you need 3 ingredients: water, lye (NaOH), and the fat/oil of your choice (lard is cheap &amp; plentiful). You will also want a decent kitchen scale capable of measuring to tenths of grams (or ounces), one of those immersion stick blenders, some plastic or stainless steel containers (NOT aluminum), and something to use as a mold (empty pringles cans are a great place to start). Soap can get as fancy as you want to make it, but for myself I just make the basic shit. You have to do a little math, and you have to respect the caustic chemicals, but it's pretty easy overall.

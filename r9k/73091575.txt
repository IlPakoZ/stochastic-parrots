It must be in the water or something.
I'm mid 20's with a good degree and job, but the majority of people I grew up with are dropouts, in debt, addicted to booze/weed, and in dead-end work.
I'm not even talking about poor or retarded kids, but just ordinary middle-class ones who gave up at some point.

What zero pussy does to a mf.
It's a catch 22 and a negative feedback loop.
The less you get laid, the worse you get treated..the worse you get treated the less chance at getting laid.
Eventually you're shunned completely and your chances zero out flat.
It's a function of society to practice "genetic hygiene" in this way, but no one admits it is actually a form of soft eugenics.
I'm not even salty about it, as I biologist I see the pragmatism behind the cruelty.

chronic anxiety from the age of about 7 made me into a reclusive shut-in afraid of life. Spent all of 12-24 alone on my computer. I just got my first minimum wage job at 25 which I still have to this day. 

My parents tried to make me do sports and swimming and chess club and school dances etc. but I hated all of it and cried until they took me home, I'm just genetic shit with a dozen mental illnesses.

Save your platitudes, I'm not an incel or anything. But am painfully aware of their hardships.
They aren't exaggerating when they say that society is set against them, it's no surprise the turn to fringe groups to find compationship. Best case scenario, they do like you say, they start trout fishing and make fishing friends, worse case they start firebombing and make nazi friends.
Basically your advice is useless and doesn't address the moral or philosophical issues of a society that practices soft eugenics.

I never had friends in school. I had one friend and now we don't talk anymore and I'm pretty sure he lives in Japan now. I want to get a job and a car and everything but it is kind of discouraging when I know that even if I do I'll just be living a life of total isolation with no friends other than my brothers and their friends who I generally find unbearable to be around.

Mental illness and the fact that I was smaller than the other kids probably did it.
My parents are alright but probably too old.

Normal upbringing but no friends for 10 years now.
I don't like being around men and I'm too horny to be around young women so I'm alone on r9k.

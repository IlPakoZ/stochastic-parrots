Is there even much of a point in trying for love if you're naturally shy and not very dominant 
>90% of women's attraction to a guy is his dominance
>the idea of you stuttering out some dom shit is cringey and a fucking joke
>gay relationships will just have you seen as the bottom and thus not seen as a real man

>gay relationships

I was saying going gay isn't an option either because you're just seen as a diet woman

Find a girl who likes shy guys? Or actually dont find a girl, ever. I just know that you are insufferable

Might as well tell OP to just win the lottery.

I mean I'm not op but I appear shy (I just hate most people, both their bodies and minds so I ignore everyone who isn't into anime and lifting weights)
And I had some normie mid girls approach me but I just declined both times 
The type of women I'm into doesn't exist so I can just cope my entire life with being not normal (this entire society is not normal though)

If you're even considering going gay as an option I have some bad news for you

I mean op is doing everything except doing the thing that would make him get a gf 
Of course he even though about going gay or even shit like necrophilia but he didn't write that

You are not a,real man if you are shy, so why do you feel entitled to be treated as one?

i dont really think so.
the dudes i've seen who were like that but got married since the 60s and 70s were a completely different time ended up with emasculating shrews.

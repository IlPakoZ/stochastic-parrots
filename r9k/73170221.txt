I'm not suicidal lately. I just live day to day doing the same thing over and over again.
I'm waiting for something really bad to happen in my life. The moment I lose all hope, I will kill myself.

Metastable at 'mom would be sad and even if mom wouldn't be sad, I'd want to do gunshot to the head and getting my hands on a gun seems like a whole thing'.

Being truly neurotic unlike a character disorder is quite the curse. No more fren, no desire for fren. After a while your memory fades given enough time isolating. I'm an automaton whos objective is survival. Emotions are non-existant. I'm neither masculine or feminine as I switch between the two. I often feel like a ghost. How's that for fucked in the head. Should just let people like myself kill ourselves and clean the gene pool of our fucked dna.

that seems like a messy way to go. could you imagine your poor mother sobbing as the paramedics desperately try to revive your bloodied body only to be unsuccessful?

you have purpose. do something good. help someone. volunteer somewhere. i promise you have people who think of you and would be destroyed over the loss of you.

No. I am alone. The few people that tried to be friends with me quickly got bored and even my family members are losing interest in seeing me.

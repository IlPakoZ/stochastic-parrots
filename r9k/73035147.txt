I was driving to Illinois all last year to familiarize myself with legal weed: drove a couple peeps there, gave em the reigns, made edibles with each type concentrate, tested the various pens and their brands, shake and popcorn new and famous strains, topical oil, drinks, candies, pre-rolls. Tried it all finally.
Come 2023 we get medical marijuana: first dispensary opens in my hometown, tell people, they're in complete disbelief and don't wanna bother - even for a moment - unless they know they don't need a medical card to purchase and whether it's THC-0, THC(A), D8/D9/D11 because "I don't wanna fuck with that fake shit". Tell em "They're hiring budtenders".
>Hurr durr what's a budtender?

It's fucking pointless sometimes I hate to admit. Cat has a wheeze and I don't have the money to take him to the vet. Everything else is fucking great! lol but just, feels like a whole goddamn illusion waiting to stab me in the back.

my professor called off class because too many people were messaging that they weren't going to show up to class.

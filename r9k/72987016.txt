I sometimes think about how lucky i am in my perma virginity at the age of 32.
I have mever heard or seen people have sex in real life, not through a wall or through a window. Never even seen a vagina IRL that i can remember
I can imagine how traumatic it must be to regularly have people have sex around you that you cannot deny because you can slightly see it or hear it.
When I think of it I can't even remember talking about sex in anyway on those breaks in highschool with classmates or with friends or even with friends of friends. I seeming must have avoided it all.

I also have never seen a dead person IRL or even been close to a relative that were a put to die in the following days. Of all my 3 grandparents that have died i have visited only 1 in a hospital months before her death. The other 2 I only visited when they got back home to their house for a break from the hospital before going back to then die.
Both my two family cats have also been taken by my sister, mom and dad to the veterinary when things got really bad one day and they had to be put to sleep and both times I was away doing something.

Both sex and death are basically movie fiction to me in my life, except for seeing some dead mouse by the road once or twice in my life.
Porn is as close as I've gotten to sex in 32 years.

I think this is good for me in a way since if those things keep being nebulous to me then the absent of them doesn't hurt as much. Atleast that's what I speculate, I probably will never know about how or why anyway if things keep going as they have been.

if i came across strangers having sex, i think i'd view it like animals mating.

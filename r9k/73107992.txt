I switched to a carnivore and energy drink based diet and now I have unlimited energy, whereas before I was always sluggish and lazy. I legit have TOO MUCH energy, I cannot even expend enough of my energy in in a single day to go to bed at a normal time. I can fuck for hours on end, I can fight until death, I can skip breaks at work if I want to (still don't). Fruit and Vegetables are literally bad for you, I can't believe how retarded that would sound to me three months ago and yet here I am saying it. And if those are bad for you then addeds sugar might as well be literal actual poison.

It's the energy drinks, not the meat. I can pop a Vyvanse pill and get the same thing and become a worker drone the whole day, because it's a stimulant like caffeine. Consuming caffeine is not dissimilar to taking Vyvanse in my experience

Based, you may get an increase in testosterone and stabilize your hormones along with other benefits.

It's a mixture of both. Back when I was eating more carbs I would always feel sluggish afterwards and I can tell that the meat definitely helped, the sugar free energy drinks just pushed it to another level.

Energy drinks taste evil. They work much better than coffee but I don't trust them. I prefer redbull to monster when I drink them just because it doesn't taste as awful.

The same thing happened to me when I ate a lot of carbs, but in theory they run on a longer energy cycle and the brainfog may be temporary. I would always dream more intensely and wake up in the morning with more energy when I ate carbs, so maybe they are okay

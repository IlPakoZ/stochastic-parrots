How much of your behavior is automatic?
For example I visited 4chan without really thinking about it

I sometimes find myself automatically going to /b/ instead of /r9k/, even though I stopped using that board in 2009

You are now breathing manually

You've now realized there's no comfortable spot in your mouth for your tongue

You are now manually holding your jaw up

You haven't blinked in a few seconds. Go ahead and blink

You realize you can see a little bit of your nose all the time

/b/ is the new /r9k. At some point that became the place for interesting greentext stories and OC, while /r9k/ is mostly faggot/tranny/cuck spam

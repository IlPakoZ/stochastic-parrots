If I make the way so how,
If I make the way so how,
Think again to do so how,
Think believe the way so how,
I know again I'll make it now,
I'll see the way -- the end, so how,
So how we do? How may we do?
How may we do? How may we do?
It's just like this, I'll explain it short.
It's just like this, you go and do.

No it really doesn't. Looks fine. You're just retarded. Many such cases.

Pic related is you except for graphics in a Chinese cartoon. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is outdated as shit and still considered one of the GOATs.

Sure it is, I'm not disputing that. Legend of the Galactic Heroes can be good, and Chainsaw Man anime can be trash. It is possible for both of those things to be true, and that is the case.

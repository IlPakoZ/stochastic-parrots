Ms. Empathy who claims that all males are sooo simple to read to her should damn well notice how little most guys care to have some workaholic career-chaser with tits in their life.
Srsly bitch, most of the straight guys who claim to be okay with that nu-female shit to your face will much rather fuck a subby prostitute half their age on the weekend

>why aren't you Improooving?
because these women aren't worth improving for. they ask magnitudes too much of you, whilst offering essentially nothing themselves that you value. they offer things *they* value, but men and women do not value the same things so they ultimately offer nothing. their behaviour and attitudes are abysmal, they are selfish, they cannot love, they cannot prioritize anyone else, they will jump to someone new without hesitation or even caring about the damage they cause to others.
what in the name of fuck would you want to dedicate your life to wage slaving and 'improving' merely to attain that? not even that, the CHANCE at that. unless you give men a guaranteed outcome at the end, and that guaranteed outcome is something they want, they will not bother to work for it because it's vastly not in their favour.

>>73082087
>why they are so reluctant to accept ONE failure?

Because they are fully ideologically committed to certain propositions being true, and they think that if they admit failure even when that failure is obvious it will undermine those propositions.

It's "too important for other women to know they have this option" for them to admit that it failed.

Women buy into this fallacy that their career makes them a more valuable partner to men in the same way that men buy into this fallacy that their 'niceness' makes them a better partner choice to women. It's just a fundamental misunderstanding of what the other gender finds attractive, and projecting what you yourself want onto what they want. 

Men do not give a fuck what your career is, 90+% of men only care about looks and personality. The female equivalent of a white collar guy making 200k in terms of attractiveness isn't a white collar girl making 200k, it's the 7-8/10 secretary making 50k. Women are attracted to status/money, so they assume guys are too, and that they are entitled to a top tier guy if they themselves have status/money. The truth is most guys do not give a fuck about the status or money of their partner, and this is what many professional women fail to grasp.

except men don't gaslight women 24/7 about caring what their career is

women always say they like a nice (in synonyms now because "nice guy" became a meme) guy
when women are dealing with men whining about being nice but women not liking them after the "you're not really nice if you want women to date you" argument they'll shift to the "niceness is the bare minimum" argument (while they date a nazi who punches them in the face)

Meanwhile I see the opposite with women and the value of their career
On multiple occasions I've seen successful women melt down and start accusing men of being intimidated when they say they don't really care about a womans career 

Women aggressively pushing dating fallacies on both men and women.

Fucking ay this is so true.

The very ones who say that you need to listen to women to understand how they think will do this the most.

I actually like successful women, but not for their success. I don't care about that at all. I like the class markers that go with it - the way they dress, the way they speak, they way they move. The ideal woman for me would be perfectly outfitted to work in BigLaw, but would not actually work there.

You can't tell them that, though. They'd go berserk.

Tell me how/why I simultaneously have everything I need for a maximum comfy standard of living for myself, while simultaneously being a gigantic fucking undatable loser to 85% of the female population. They are so materialistic. It's just much easier for men to be happy. There's about a 35k/year gap between me hitting the point of diminishing returns regarding income where making more money basically isn't going to make me that much happier for any reason not related to bitches/vaginas, and me actually having the baseline, so so, meh, kind of acceptable income level that they would not consider me a loser at.

To be fair, women do like a good doormat, they just don't want to fuck one.

Things are fucked though for men, real fucked. So you're probably actually more likely to get a cuck simp faggot giving out bluepilled shit than a woman. But women are ultra stupid and kiked too, since they never have to develop a sense of self awareness past that of a toddler, because of how much society coddles them.

I'm not an intel, but yes it is. It's women effectively taking the educational system and changing the entire thing to their favor, and then tax incentives for companies to hire and promote them, and then saying "I did it!" while other women squeal in delight, knowing they, too, can do it too if they try, because the conditions of failure have been removed for them.

It's very stupid.
--- 73085018

I mean you're not wrong, but having high expectations of women is asking ot be disappointed. Feminism has created this fallacy that women are as rational as men, but truth be told they are way more susceptible to delusions meant to keep their emotional state relatively stable. Trusting what a woman says is a fool's game, you can only trust their actions, and they often tell very different stories.

>Women buy into this fallacy that their career makes them a more valuable partner to men
I don't think this is the core issue, it's more that they are sold the idea that they need to be independent so that men can't play power games in relationships, as well as to be completely free to choose whoever they want as their partner. And to be independent they have to pursue a high-paying career. 
Then just by nature of being professionally successful assume that they should be able to get a similarly successful man, but that man still can't be a balding virgin IT nerd.
--- 73086553
>>73086379
I don't think women get high paying jobs to avoid "power games", I think they go for high paying jobs to buy things and beyond that it's social proof. Women don't need anything to have power over men, they were born with power over men.

So wait, it's as if she's the surrogate but adopting the baby. What's the point at that point? Go straight to adoption.

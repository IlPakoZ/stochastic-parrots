Do people actually like ask out girls? Does that really happen? I've never had a gf and have never asked out anyone in my life so I guess I could blame myself but I just can't imagine a situation where asking a girl out would seem natural you feel me

My first two girlfriend asked me out.
Later, I tried really hard at Tinder, thinking I "had" to have a GF, and I asked a girl out. It worked, she said yes, but I had no feelings for her, and I was living a lie, and I had to end the relationship?

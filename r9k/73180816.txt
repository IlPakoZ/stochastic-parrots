These threads are transparently a market research campaign, same thing happened with Ready Player One right up to it's release. I guess it's because of how well the Mario movie did.

Enjoy this picture, wagie.

Odd, I most strongly identify with the one before my primary audience. Most zoomer shit is garbage but teen titans go is the shit. Highly underrated.

Core Millennial to Early Zoomer but everything I grew up with is Core Millennial and Late Millennial
I'm a 1996er. Every after Early Zoomer is shit

1997 here

Although less clear, my fondest memories are late millennial.
Everything after mid-core zoomer gets increasingly soulless.

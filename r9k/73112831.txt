First for fakegaycels fuck off!!!
--- 73112925
They are putting my uncle's dog down today. I'm gonna miss her. She was a strong girl, almost as old as me. 

Do you have dogs r9gay?
--- 73112946
Griffith was a villain. What makes you think I'd risk this precious peace I've found at last for someone like that?
--- 73112986
>>73112925
>I'm gonna miss her
prison gay
--- 73112989
>>73112946
He did nothing wrong when you think about it. And I'd risk everything in my life to find eternal love.
--- 73113100
What a beautiful, sunny day. No bf to go for a walk n talk with :(((
--- 73113112
>>73112989
Really? Would you give up on being a bad person and become good instead?
--- 73113133
>>73113112
I don't like being a bad person. I'm on my redemption arc.
--- 73113175
>>73112989
GAYFFITS!!!
--- 73113481
You must speak citizens of r9gay!
--- 73113521
>>73113133
Fine, I'll hold your hand and hold you accountable.
--- 73113576
>shy boys who are very dominant in bed >~&lt;
--- 73113616
>>73113576
Quiet doesn't always mean shy. Sometimes it's more stoic and aloof.
--- 73113642
>>73113521
Cute.
>>73113576
Me desu desu
--- 73113653
>trooned out cuz hair loss (not receding but not thick enough for long hair
>wake up thinking it was all a nightmare
>look down and see cone tits
I'm not sure if i made the right decision
--- 73113678
I want a bf, but the thought of having such a shared life is weird
--- 73113704
>>73113678
yeah, i'm not sure i'm willing to give up my solitary and comfortable bohemian lifestyle just for a bf who will probably break up with me at some point anyways
--- 73113751
>>73113576
I'm a shy boy but I'm not dominant in bed
--- 73113757
>>73113678
I just don't want people making fun of me for how retarded I am when it comes to basic tasks
--- 73113777
I am taking husband applications for long haired beautiful boys who want to spend their life with me. Also I am going to take a nap I need a rest.
--- 73113789
i have long hair and may be beautiful. but of what persuasion of person does anon belong to?
--- 73113802
>>73113789
he belongs to the nigger kind
--- 73113804
>>73113642
Just- uh, ow, just, cut your fingernails, please.
--- 73113882
tfw a long haired not that attractive boy
--- 73113907
Venti did you ever actually have a boyfriend?
--- 73113928
>>73113907
he's had three in the past month
--- 73114005
Perfect husbands!
--- 73114012
>>73113616
That can be true. I was thinking more of easily embarrassed boys who have teouble speaking up in public.
>>73113642
>Me desu desu
Well in that case i would like to inform you that you have the best of both worlds, a perfect combination! It's very cute aaaaaa
>>73113751
That's most shy boys T_T
It's still cute anon, don't worry
--- 73114019
>>73114012
>>It's still cute anon, don't worry
thx, but it's not fun being too shy ;_;
--- 73114024
>>73113757
Oh my god you are literally me o_o
--- 73114065
Long hair is overrated. It can look good on some guys and everything beats buzzcut and bald but medium lenghts is best. You get bonus points for not looking like a tranny or hipster jesus
--- 73114265
>>73114005
For heaven's sake, anon. They were cousins!
--- 73114430
>>73114065
thick fluffy hair is best :3
--- 73114501
>>73112440 →
I personally really liked Golden Kamuy and Berserk (never tried the anime, never will).
--- 73114515
>>73114265

straight royals married their cousins, why can't gay cousins? Plus no inbred kids with hemophilia.
--- 73114542
>>73114515
I can't exactly argue against that.
--- 73114611
>>73114542

also they both got tattoos when they went aboard as young men, so they were not stuffy uptight prissy princes.
--- 73114754
>>73113653
Does your dick still work or did you break that too
--- 73114826
I eat too much sweets
--- 73114880
I want a bf so bad but I can't use tinder so I'm stuck looking for love on grindr
--- 73115036

--- 73115322
I'm rocking unkempt long hair with no bangs as I'm balding. I would never cut my long hair though, I love it too much.
--- 73115347
>>73115322
Start finasteride, go full wizard mode with long luscious silver hair.
--- 73115352
Unironically schizoids are happy when being alone. Beat that.
--- 73115361
>>73115347

doesn't that give you ED? I like my fapping more.
--- 73115381
>>73115361
>These studies which are discussed below reveal that sexual adverse effects occur at the rates of 2.1% to 3.8%, erectile dysfunction (ED) being the most common followed by ejaculatory dysfunction and loss of libido. These effects occurred early in the therapy and returned to normal on stopping or over a time on continuous use of the drug. The only causal relation between finasteride and sexual adverse effects is decreased ejaculatory volume because of predominant action of DHT on prostate.

tl;dr yes but no. At first it's *possible (below 5%) but apparently as you continue the regimen that goes away. You might coom less but you'll still orgasm just fine.
--- 73115400
Oh I thought he meant eating disorder

i mean anon you're getting kind of fat maybe you should have one tee hee
--- 73115410
> A comprehensive review of a total of 73 papers on medical therapies for BPH was conducted, with a focus on the effects of different pharmacological agents on sexual function. The review revealed that finasteride is infrequently associated with problems of ejaculation (2.1-7.7%), erection (4.9-15.8%), and libido (3.1-5.4%).
>The role of nocebo effect in the causation of ED due to finasteride has been investigated. Nocebo effect refers to an adverse effect that results from the psychological awareness of the possibility of the side effects, but is not a direct result of the specific pharmacological action of the drug. In this study, the group informed about the sexual adverse effects of finasteride reported increased incidence of ED, when compared to the group without information.

Seems to be more of a "you can psych yourself into disabling your dick" problem.

Hard question to answer but I consider myself damned and ambitious. I wanna be the best version of myself.
--- 73115787
I will admit America is fucked however your country did not go to the moon. Our country did. Even when our country declines into a Latin American tier shithole we will still hold the title of first people to land on the moon while your country will have nothing.
--- 73115794
Your country is not white tho
--- 73115806
>>73115794
>uhmm but racial demographics
Yeah I know its fucked thats why I said its fucked however we landed on the moon and you did not.

We got guns and the best food.

--- 73115871
In an ideal fantasy world we'd break up like Yugoslavia and I would be declared king of the Atlantic states of America and I'd first TND TJD TTD and then I'd set up a harem of cute boys which all live in my fancy Maine estate.
--- 73115903
>>73115806
No no, I mean even "white" americans ain't really white
--- 73115913
I'm so fuckin lonely and I'm going to kill myself

we have so much in common, we should kiss
--- 73116028
>>73115903
Well that's a lie. Miscegenation was frowned upon by most of society even into the 70s. Race mixing isn't even common with in the united states. 

People moving in from another country does not change the ancestry of the people already living there. We unlike the people south of the border our colonists were never super rapey with the natives. Its like saying all South Africans are white because Dutch and English colonists settled there. I've had this argument before so I'm just gonna quote Wikipedia

>From the 23andMe database, about 5 to at least 13 percent of self-identified white American Southerners have greater than 1 percent African ancestry.[78] Southern states with the highest African American populations tended to have the highest percentages of hidden African ancestry.[79] White Americans (European Americans) on average are: "98.6 percent European, 0.19 percent African and 0.18 percent Native American.

Unless you're gonna claim that being .37 percent non white on average means black as coal.

NO ANON NO PLEASE NO DEAR GOD NO PLEASE IM SORRY!!!!
--- 73116596
white is a colonial invention which is why ONLY protestants from britain and netherlands are truly white and protestants from the rest of northern europe are white adjacent. anything else is a corruption of the term forced by germany because they were to disorganized to do anything good before the end of 19th century but they wanted to be white(they failed so they decided to ruin racial science for everyone white instead)
--- 73116655
>>73116596
Yeah but no one uses White like that. We live in the 21st century(sadly) White just means anyone of European descent.

Learn about complementary colors and branch out with different accessories and combos. Thrift for this imo because you might need to bulk up your wardrobe. Pay attention to fit and silhouette. Look at other people's clothes and notice them. Like my podiatrist who rocks the newbalance 550s.
--- 73116891
develop your personal schtyle!

I don't think I'd like that kind of person. I'd find them annoying and they'd sense it so even if I didn't -really- dislike them they'd avoid me out of politeness.

Tbh I'm starting to understand the appeal of body pillows and it scares me. The cat didn't piss on my cringe spot when she pissed on the floor tho so that's nice.

i wonder what average gays think about.
--- 73118682
>>73118652
How does that make me less shameless? It's not shame but pride that makes me virgin. I don't want to lose my virginity to a mediocre hookup as a pudgy loser lol.
--- 73118685
>>73118530
Try doing some fancy footwork exercises for boxing. It's kinda like dancing lol
>>73118589
That doesn't seem too bad. Fatties can dance too. What type od dance would you like to learn?
--- 73118692
>>73118682

>I don't want to lose my virginity to a mediocre hookup
Is a "mediocre hookup" the best you can get? 
Why don't you lose your virginity in the way that befits your standards?
--- 73118780
>>73118756

not until may 14th, which this year is also mother's day as a nice little 'fuck you' from the universe.

Thank you dear sir.

What's your favorite berserk battle tho?
Why's your throat sore?
--- 73118833
Don't talk to me shitskin. 

I have been reborn into a better person but my hate for south americans and sex havers remain the same. 

Gonna go shower now.
--- 73118836
>>73118811

about the same, trying to get by day to day. The lawyer didn't call with the medicaid bill so I'll likely call on Monday to ask what's happening with that.

Once I get that, like I have said before, I'll be able to know if I keep the house or not.
--- 73118841
you're still the same lonely gay dying for a bf. You just can't admit it
--- 73118851

--- 73118872
>>73118833
Why do you stink?
--- 73118877
>>73118853

I have over 200k in the bank right now, as well as a credit card which I use to buy everything, then pay off the bill every month so I don't get interest.
--- 73118878
>>73118853
He has like 200k but he's shit with money
--- 73118880
>>73118836
Have you looked for cash stashes around the house?
Some people keep those
Hmm.
Also
This is been long, i guess you rather not deal with it much but, you should maybe start asking around and think of a different lawyer
--- 73118884
Remember to stay hidrated boys
--- 73118886
>>73118851
I have very white skin. 
>>73118827
I'm honestly gonna what berserk right now after I shower. It sounds really good. I got a flu or something I feel fucked up.
--- 73118916
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
--- 73118920
>>73118880

this is already the second one I've been to. Plus it may not be in yet, he said it takes around 4-5 weeks and it's just now going on 4.

as for cash stashes, mom liked to pay cash for things so I have roughly 2000 in cash that was in the safe. I don't think she's put money anywhere else, and if my grandparents did we'd have found it by now, or it was taken by the workers before we moved in.

decent. my only major fuck up was on Monday when I tried to cook a chuck steak in the skillet instead of the oven like mom always did. It was burned on the outside but still too rare for my liking instead, but mostly it so tough and fatty I couldn't eat most of it. 

Today I went to the store and got a bunch of meat, so I'm planning on cooking most days this week.

Oh I'm quite aware and knew this before mom passed away. Going out somewhere was always much more expensive than cooking. We normally ate out once a week, either a fast place or a pizza. I have kept this pattern for the most part, except in the first few weeks where I did order pizza a lot.

further more admitting you like femboys is basically telling the world that you are a creep who should not be allowed around minors.

why would i do that originally speaking

ive been hairy since I was like 14
--- 73119783
Shaved my arms a week ago. It's okay but I miss my hair. 

Also I'm thinking about waxing because body hair and facial hair is annoying as fuck but I don't know how to use wax.
--- 73119789
>>73119743
So i can pick a blade that best suits you. I will end you, that much is certain, but i'm a nice guy. I will choose the weapon that best suits you. Think about it
--- 73119807
>>73119789
choose whichever. give me the express service please and thank you
--- 73119829
I don't understand fags who like bodyhair. It's so much nicer to touch smooth legs than to feel bodyhair between your fingers. This isn't debatable. Try it out.
Not to mention it looks better.
--- 73119836
>>73119783
It's not hard
Tho, id advice you get a wax melter, maybe try veet instead or waxing pads
They are somewhat cheaper and easy to use
Wax is a bit hard to keep warm long enough, and Pulling does hurt a lot

Why you. Miss your hair?
--- 73119852
>>73119836
Not having pithair just feels weird to me. Don't exactly miss it though. I will ask one of my female relatives about waxing, see if I can get any sort of response.
--- 73119854
I wanna lick hairless armpits mmmmmmmm
--- 73119884
I shaved my armpits once but it was pretty uncomfortable and it grew back pretty quickly. Not worth
--- 73119888

Pithair ?
I see
Never had it, i figure it would be uncomfy

--- 73120045
>>73119984
I didn't get mine until 15 and I was definitely using this site before then so I'm sure there are people here young enough to not have armpit hair.

>>73120000
Probably the hormone blockers. Estrogen won't prevent armpit hair. Also just more proof that the bullshit about hormone blockers being "reversible" "temporary" etc is completely false.

Can you tell me why trannies are all such horrible people? When I first found out about them as a kid I thought they were like everyone else, with some being bad and some being good. But I've yet to meet a good one, they've all been just completely rotten people. Just recently I was playing an indie game with a small playerbase and a tranny was in the multiplayer mode being a piece of shit for no reason. Like what is the point, and why is it always so constant? Before that, I was in a chatroom and a tranny got mad at two other users for talking about a topic that he thought was boring. But he wasn't even online at the time when the other two started talking.
--- 73120194
>>73120153
You don't sound like a good person yourself
--- 73120218
>>73120194
Trannies are bad because my post sounded mean? Have you discovered a secret related to reverse causality that I'm unaware of?
--- 73120219
i forgot how boring you fags can be
--- 73120238
>>73120153
Well
There's many thing, emotional instability, neglect of other problems they have, not passing, puching that fact on other people as a way to lash out, Lack of empathy, some also get mad over politics or how the community uses them, some get involved with toxic sides of it
Even myself, don't think I'm out of this
So yeah, maybe we aren't good people, but i don't think it's everyone
Maybe just all that have to say they were or are part of it
--- 73120242
>>73120153
Not that anon but I think its just due to them being entitled because every corporation and media influencer and such has bent the knee completely to them and they are also just mentally ill even ignoring the transgenderism itself being mental illness. All trannies have some form of problem with their brain. Whether it be bpd or schizophrenia or depression or anxiety. They are all basketcases who hate themselves. These people are probably not gonna be figures which people want to look up to.
--- 73120259
>>73120242
Yeah
A bit harsh but youre not that far, tho i think you are mostly talking about those who get very into the lgbt community and make it their whole personality

--- 73120536
>>73120238
I always see people online talking about how ___ tranny is "one of the good ones", but it always ends up being fake. I see all these names being pushed around, contrapoints, blair white... but they are all just more of the same. Condescending, passive aggressive, inconsiderate, rude.
The thing is I never wanted to be a hater, but they just won't stop being so hateable. Growing up on the internet, I would read all sorts of racist things about blacks, but I never developed a racist attitude towards them, and over time as I met more of them in real life my notion that they were mostly good people was confirmed. Same thing with mexicans, jews, gays, whatever group. Only when it comes to trans is it impossible to find good people no matter how hard I tried.
--- 73120540
Do you guys... like other guys?

--- 73120604
>>73120536
Again, i tho this mostly the ones that get too much into it for being more nby, not passing and into lgbt groups way too much
Otherwise
How would you even know they are trans? Trans people really don't want to shout it out or talk about it
The ones who do have more issues that aren't always propperly addresed
Personally i just know of one or 2 internet peoples who look creepy, haven't dealt with other trans people at all

anon please, can't you see the crystal clear hate bias of someone who says "every member of [x] group is a bad person" and substantiates that thought with internet anecdotes? 
That person has definitely not tried very hard to find good trannies, or any trannies at all. The only trannies he cares about are the ones who give him an excuse to keep hating on them
--- 73120791
>>73120757
Some things shouldn't be represented, like you.
--- 73120844
>>73120604
First of all, this "passing" trans thing is idiotic. You have to literally get surgery all over your body, use makeup, and then use camera angles in order to hide it. "what about intersex peopl-" what about them? They are not trans.
As for irl trans, I met two of them, and both left terrible impressions. One of them was a complete asshole for no reason. There was a presentation and the trans kept insulting the presenter. Why?? The other didn't do anything actively malicious, but also literally did not shower and was lazy as fuck. And I know what you're going to say "there are plenty of people who are lazy and don't shower" yeah sure but that doesn't mean they are good people.

Another time breaking that anon's promise of not bringing it up, but oh well...

I wonder if having a bf who reassures me that nothing bad will happen if I don't do my compulsions would be effective? Or maybe he could do some kind of spell to prevent me from fearing the consequences of not responding to an intrusive thought? Either way, would be interesting to have a sacred thing in the from of a person with whom you can interact; a bastion of purity to keep the filthy thoughts away.

Going back to your 'sacred thing' 'bastion of purity,' I feel like that's a ticking bomb waiting to go off when something inevitably causes your perception of him to become soiled too, undermining not just your attraction but also the dynamic between you.

Becoming very bad, or generally having trouble with the few things which I care about. And besides that a huge part of it is my desire to simply not have filthy thoughts while doing cool stuff. Even if I lost all delusions (although self-fulfilling prophecies do exist) of their influence I am still left with the knowledge of them happening. And I really dislike being aware that I just had a bad thought while engaging in a passion of mine.

There is only a handful of things that could do that. And if he were my bf then those would be by definition not of concern. I'm more worried about getting too avoidant and psychopathic on him. But other than that I'd be probably ultra clingy :D

I think hat the set of thoughts which I don't wanna have is smaller than the set of those towards which I'm at least ambivalent. I just don't wanna have certain thoughts and nothing more than that. So I don't think that I'm very concerned about having mastery over my all my thoughts, just the bad ones. The thing that differentiates them from neutral or good thoughts is that they feature, or that I associate them with, concepts and/or ideas and/or people who I find vehemently disgusting. And in my experience the pink elephant dilemma only happens when I become aware of an impending action's importance. That action then becomes the prime target for corruption by the thoughts.
>>73127424

I suppose my question is whether it upsets you more that you have these thoughts at all than the thoughts themselves, but from your response here it doesn't sound like it. Is it then that those thoughts are so powerful that simply having them is enough to send you into an episode? 
Concepts and ideas are very different to people. Are these people whom you have suffered abuse from in the past? What of these concepts and ideas, do they have a particular theme? Sexual, violent, something like that? Is there an example you can divulge?
Does an action's importance have to relate to these negative thoughts in any way, or is it simply that your mind finds tenuous links from these negative thoughts to anything that is taking up a significant portion of your mental space?
Forgive the prying nature of my questions, and of course I'll understand if you aren't comfortable answering them. I just find this interesting.

It all depends on the mood and my general level of misery at the moment, but yes, I have had a good number of times where one thought escalated into an episode of inner lunacy. Luckily those moments seem to have gotten rarer.
>Concepts and ideas are very different to people.
Absolutely not (to me at least :3). "People don't matter only what they represent." - Steel Man
The only people who I dislike primarily due to abuse are my parents, everyone else never did me any socially recognized harm (I say this because their ugliness is very much a most grievous form of harm to me). But it all still very much seems to have some sorts of traumatic underpinnings. But think of getting scared by an image, for instance, and not necessarily an event.
The closest that I can get to discerning a theme among the taboo thoughts is by saying that they all have a connection towards things I deem: "rural", "traditional", "right-wing", etc.
And I don't know if I should give an example, I fear that I'm thinking too much about these unpleasant things. I do something and then a visual thought pops up and suddenly the thing I was doing starts feeling "dirty". Metaphysical contamination obsessive-compulsive disorder they call it.
>>73128003
Hmmm what stuff do you enjoy doing anon?
--- 73128154
>>73128088
>sounds like the single lease appealing thing I could do right now.
That's the part where your rationality should take over. It's like taking a bitter medicine. Sure it tastes horrible. But you go through that unpleasant moment so you can reap the benefits in the future. Like hard work first, rewards later. 
Of course the idea of facing your fears isn't appealing. But the real question here is this: do you find the idea of never having a bf appealing? So why are you headed in that direction? 
Be reasonable. Face your fears and the universe will reward you with coming of age experiences

I enjoy doing lots of stuff. I go through stages of liking things. Most recently I've been in a /lit-fit/ and style phase that feels very refreshing, but a bit narcissistic.
--- 73128636
I used to have similar stages when I was younger I think. But now I'm fully one-dimensional! Wanna list a few of them thingies that make you all giddy inside?
>/lit.../
O.o w-what is your favorite book anon? And can you please mog me?
--- 73128659
>>73128098
It's good that things seem to be getting better. I know you annoy me sometimes but you're one of us and you're alright really 
People not mattering really depends on the person, but I see your point here. Were your parents right wing, or is it something else that makes associations with rural trad aesthetic upsetting to you? Or, do you even know what it is? The way your speak about it sounds more like a pattern you've happened to observe than something consciously built, but I could be misreading you.
What about the OCD rituals themselves? I assume you're the anon who used to mention obsessive hand washing. Is it something that calms you, or are you trying to force out negative thoughts? Are you worried that your thoughts will rub off on you if you let them linger?

>>73128659
>you annoy me sometimes
How can I prevent this?
I think that a defining factor in the parthenogenesis of the thoughts happened to be my immediate and greater surroundings in relation to my contrarian mindset. It's like living with the bucharest sewer people for me, so I would heavily expect that if I grew up somewhere less stinky I would have fewer brain problems, or maybe even none at all. So yeah my surrounding is/was full with things that I find disgusting.
I wash my hands because I touch things which I find dirty, if I don't then I feel all yucky. Here's a cool compulsion: I must way for at least an hour before I can move through a space where someone disgusting passed through. It's all about the aesthetics, I'm too sensitive to ugliness.
And yeah, I think I'll stop for now with the OCD inspection. So feel free to change the subject anon.
>>73128683
Is there an issue, genosse?
--- 73128963

Like i said before Mr Anon. Larping is only cool when I do it. Get outta here.
--- 73129025

I just like the aesthetic of the GDR I think. It's not my intention to come off as pretending to harbor feelings that go beyond that. But being a State Security agent does seem kinda based uwu.

--- 73129158
>>73128636
Hopefully you can figure out what you're interested in and move into other stuff too, a lot of people get stuck in one or two things their whole lives and never have anything else. 
>thingies that make you all giddy inside? 
Cooking, games, backpack trips, writing, not much actually makes me feel happy but some of them are at least fun.

I don't think I have a favorite book, it would be embarrassing to pick just one..
--- 73129240
>>73129158
But I have already figured it out! It might be all fall under the same academic field, but it's nevertheless pretty diverse! There is nothing else in life for me, and I don't want it to be any different. The only thing that sucks is that my desire to live is directly proportional to the amount of fun that that limited number of subjects generates for me :/
What stuff do you write about anon? What is the current bookie that you are reading?
>backpack trips

--- 73129351
>>73129240
Well, it's also very fortunate for you to clearly know what you're interested in and what your reason for living is. Most people don't have one of those, or it's something lame like family. Can I ask what yours is, or is that a secret?

I just write whatever, poems and short stories mostly. I have a few books outlined that I don't want to write because I know I won't be happy with the product. I wouldn't consider myself a writer (never published) so please don't have high expectations there. I just like to be creative
--- 73129359

Once again calling for a global genocide of all bf Havers
--- 73129429
>>73129351
It is not a secret, but I'm afraid it will have to wait until the next thread to be revealed. I spoke about the OCD in this one and therefore it feels a bit dirty, and I don't want to dirty my life's passions.
Being creative is cool anon, keep at it! What kind of books do your like to read? I mean genre-wise. Wish that I was as high-functioning as you are desu
--- 73129446
>>73129359
Sorry that you feel that way. The only thing there is to say: every silver lining's got a touch of grey.
--- 73129672
>>73129429
I think I know what it is anyway, at least sort of. Not something I have much knowledge of or interest in at the moment though. I'm still working on the grapes of wrath, it's fairly dry reading since it's set in the dust bowl. I just sit and play with my phone when I should be reading a lot of the time, haha. I could use a couple of suggestions for books to alternate with if you want to tell me what your favorite book is too.

>Wish that I was as high-functioning as you are desu
Do you think that having someone to hold you accountable would help? A little structure and discipline might be the motivation you need.

Should I go out with my friends and have some fun or should I stay inside and shitpost all night long? 
I feel like I'm at a crossroads between the way of the normal and the way of the incel
--- 73130293
>>73129985
Going out with friends is usually the more boring choice, but you should still do it sometimes to maintain the relationship and keep it as an option. If you don't go you stop having a choice.

I don't blame you it practically screams "boring", and I would find it that way too were it not for me building my entire identity around it.
But with all due respect anon, even that doesn't compare with the boredom that your novel emanates. Like seriously, you chose what has to be the most lifeless period in US history and then couple it together with the most dry literary approach out there?! That's at least what impression I get from it, and therefore will likely never proceed to actually read it. What made you choose it out of all the alternate stuff that you could instead dive into? Is the gleam of the Nobel prize that blinded you into this?
I for one don't read story books at all. So if you were looking for that kind of recommendation I'm afraid I'm at a loss, because the only story books I've read were the ones featured in my school curriculum. I also don't currently read any other types of books either, so I cannot say what my favorite book is because I haven't read it yet. But I do have a bunch of them that I undoubtedly will get around to reading, just not now. My current surroundings would be far too distracting for such a task.
>haha
Hmm, a lack of femininity. I like it!
>having someone to hold you accountable
o.o ...It seems that we really did talk before huh? I-I would certainly hope that someone like that would help me out. *sigh* What I'd give for a boy to discipline me.

--- 73130979
>>73130963
Yes and you have to hate something
--- 73130984
>>73130553
Oh shush it's not that bad, and it's an interesting period exactly because it's less popular to write about! There's a lot of very charming takes on freedom and independence from 18-19th century american lit. Idk. There are moving parts to the story and I can tell that it's drawing towards a meaningful conclusion, and to me that's a big part of the fun of reading. It's not just a story about a farm it's a commentary on capitalism and industrialization, or something. Actually that's probably missing the point pretty badly, again I haven't finished it.

>What I'd give for a boy to discipline me
Do you think you could keep it together and not get discouraged even if it was hard or you kept failing?

I don't get it though. If you want a commentary on capitalism and industrialization go read Fisher or something. If you want a compelling story go watch some indie film. Why settle for the worst of both worlds?

you are just being stupid

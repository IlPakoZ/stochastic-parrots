women like to be mogged by men.
when men have it harder it are doing worse than them it "gives them the ick" so they would rather never admit that.

Just read TwoX or watch some female Youtubers who talk about womens' issues. They have lots of issues they're just different from ours'.

>men have it harder than women
Good one anon. Half the men aged 18-35 I know are manchildren who coast off their mom and do nothing but okay vidya. There are no expectations or demands put on them and they can live as loser neets for their entire lives. Meanwhile the women I know actually have responsibilities, jobs, kids etc and are basically working all the time.

That's all their choice. They could just as easily be leeching off their parents as well

women are MUCH more likely to be hired by companies because they are women. women are much more likely to have kids because they can easily have sex whenever they want to. they also can just leech off of a partner just as easily as they can their parents as well.

even being a NEET, women still have it better.

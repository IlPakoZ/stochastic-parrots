>oh no, the 3rd worlders are suffering! what should we do to help them!?!?!
>oh, you mean those people who wouldnt have progressed past the stone age and animal behavior if the evil white people hadnt colonized their lands and run their country for them?
>who, ever since white people left, have regressed back to the stone age and animal behavior?
>hmmmm tough question. im not sure. But it definitely isnt colonizing their lands and letting white people run it for them.
>WAIT! I know! lets just send them more gibs to squander!

The global south is looted more than a trillion dollars upwards toward the global north, the wealth inequality is structural and material and not hard to prove.
We force warlords to take control so they will let us loot their resources and produce commodities like chocolate for the wealthier nations, it's not strange to see why things are shit.
As for haiti that country is just far gone, it's just bleak and hopeless.
Please educate yourself on the material and systematic causes rather than just spewing buzzwords in the future.

It's something I researched ages ago so don't have concrete proof but it's a hard case for the war in Iraq and there's concrete evidence of the US funding warlords in Somalia and some other African nations.
It's generally also a hard topic to research because by design it's overcomplicated and most people only consciously know africa as a continent where stuff is bad and not a lot of unique and diverse places.
Here are some articles that touch upon these topics though.

I kekd hard. Haven't played Catalyst but I remember picking up the original for six dollars preowned and loving it.
--- 73153825
>>73153764
Always in it to make another anon laugh :))))

I really miss that integral part of the gaming experience: going to the shop, buying preowned shit that was on sale for less than ten dollars, then taking it home and actually playing the damn thing a thousand times over.

platformer similar to wario land 4 and sonic

Is it any good? I've seen some gameplay and it looks decent. Might pirate.

I've played both Catalyst and the original: Catalyst takes a more open world approach if you're into that kind of shit but it doesn't feel too full fledged, with a rather short campaign and side missions which aren't very different from one another (not to mention the time trials are probably capable of giving you fucking ulcers). All in all, I really liked both, the parkour mechanics are solid and so's the subsequent combat. If you're looking for an even more expansive parkour-based action game I highly recommend Dying Light though

The original is absolute god tier, catalyst shouldn't exist. It's even unworthy of being called a bastardization imo.
--- 73154352
>>73154256
Catalyst could have been an incredible game if the devs breathed more life into it. Instead you're playing a game which only feels fun for a short time, and is lacking many important details

Solar Fields is the best. I love that ethereal heaven sounding music.
--- 73154392
>>73153692
Nigger tower is overrated. Keep playing Mirrors
--- 73154398
>>73154352
Not sure, anon, I got the original when it came out and it just felt so different and "grounded" compared to everything else, catalyst got that stupid shitty super futuristic style with grappling hooks and shit, talk about missing the mark.
>>73154374
also this, i'll always be thankfull to ME1 for introducing me to Solar Fields (which then also got me onto CBL). What's your fav SF song, anon?
--- 73154400
>>73153825
Do you remember the last mission in the first game at all? With the four generator type things in the corners? I had fucking palpitations trying to do that without killing anybody.
--- 73154433
>>73154400
admittedly, that part sucks a fat one. That's the low point of the entire game, though.
--- 73154503
>>73154400
>>73154433
Yeah I remember those stupid fucking things. I wish we could have destroyed them with like a rocket launcher or something, would have been far more cinematic than just a few shots with a rifle or pistol. Anon's right, that's really the only gripe I have with the game overall

I loved the first Dying Light, heavily considering the second one. Should I buy the standard or premium edition?
--- 73154703
>>73154433
>>73154503
It didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the game. I just remember having to redo it a million times. What other games are you two into?
--- 73154826
>>73154703
I love RPGs such as Fallout, other horror games like Evil Within, shooters like CoD, Battlefield and CSGO, and fighting games like Injustice and Mortal Kombat too, although I will admit I'm more or less playing for the guest characters in the latter at this point
--- 73154836
>>73154703
What about you, Anon?
--- 73154871
>>73154826
I was always SF over MK. Haven't played any Fallout after NV but I have enjoyed all of them so far. Tactics is my favorite, despite it being a ever so slightly less good JA. I like games where there are more than one viable playstyles or classes. I feel like newer games have kind of lost that but maybe I'm just being overly nostalgic.
--- 73154962
>>73154638
I think standards okay. I went premium because I liked the first and the second seemed like a good choice. The game is good enough and I am enjoying it but my dumbass decided to go hard mode and not use my inhibitors so some places I'm locked out of or I have to abused stamina reduction and clever use of other structures and items to complete some landmarks. I don't think anything story related is locked out for me. But parkour is harder since I'm stuck to land travel due to stamina limitations so limited paraglider use and I have to be good with my blocks and dodges excuse I can only take a couple of hits. All kinds of ways to get around these issues if you get good. Though nothing stops you from getting surrounded and getting beaten like a red headed step child.

>>73154398
I like the main menu theme from mirrors edge the most it's so relaxing and nostalgic. Other than that I only remember sol and road to nothingness. I love cbl as well. Comsat, MOS6581, interloper but my fav cbl song is definitely frog.
--- 73155369
>>73154871
No you're definitely correct, lots of newer games really dilute player choices as they pertain to how choices impact a game's given story and playstyle (ie: the game that has a dozen different factions but ultimately one true ending). 

Btw, what's a JA?
--- 73155877
>>73154398
Also, what I don't quite understand is that Catalyst is supposed to be a prequel, right? Why is Faith given all this gear, then, if she was never shown to have used any of it in the original, which is supposed to have taken place later on by that logic? Parkour can go along really well with grappling hooks and shit, but the thing in Catalyst is that you HAD to use them in order to traverse the world. In Dying Light your grappling hook can help out in many scenarios but by no means is it mandatory.

>>73154962
Have you played any of the DLC? Is it worth splurging that extra 10 to 20 shekels for?
--- 73155924
>>73154510
Imagine Crane or Aiden just totally butchering a jump and smashing their nuts against a ledge, then falling straight down into the clutches of a pack of famished volatiles kek
--- 73156345
>>73155924
It happens quite often.
>>73155894
I am part way through. It's okay but I'm not really sure why my character even cares at all type of deal. I'm pretty lenient so I'm not sure if I can judge the decision well.
--- 73156552
>>73153551 (OP)
I played the first ME on my PS3 lol. I remember it was the first game I played on it
--- 73157064
>>73156345
>It happens quite often. 
So THAT'S why Crane loses health on some jumps

So what you're saying is that you don't totally know if the DLC is even relevant yet?
--- 73157087
>>73156552
Honestly incredible; what year would this have been, 2008? How were things overall back then?
--- 73157125
>>73157064
I don't think there's any real relevance. It's just something Aiden just sticking his nose somewhere it doesn't belong you get sone nifty items but it's like a side story thing doesn't really add much to the lore of the world just shit sucks so let's have a carni fight club as entertainment.
--- 73157212
>>73157087
It was 2010 I think. I only had two games on my PS3 back then, one was SvR 2010 and the other was ME. I used to listen dubstep all day and had an ipod, go to school, play vidya, play football then go to sleep hopeful and excited for the next day. Truly kino times
--- 73157300
>>73157125
Is it a fun add on, at least? I usually prefer my games with DLC than without but if it's one of those add ons that truly sucks shit than I'll just buy the standard edition
>>73157212
Wait I'm retarded what's SvR again? Either way, sounds fucking incredible. Do you still have that iPod kek

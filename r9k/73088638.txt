Am I ugly if about 50% of my Tinder matches tend to ghost me after the first date or is that just how it is for men? 
The other 50% usually fuck me eventually and/or ask for more dates. There seems to be like zero correlation between the attractiveness of the girl and how likely she is to ghost me.

If you're getting dates online you're probably not ugly. Most likely just a shit personality

You're ugly if you never get matches. You're boring or awkward if you never get past the talking phase. You're uncomfortable to be around if you never go past the first date.

Given the fact that people are fickle and jaded as fuck now, 50% chance of not getting ghosted after the first date is pretty damn successful OP. You're doing just fine.

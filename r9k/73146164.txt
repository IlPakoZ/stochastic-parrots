My gf is making me eat healthier and have healthy habits, she keeps scolding me when I eat fast food and drink sugary drinks.

>gf is mad at me for drinking 4 liters of diet soda a day
It's one of the least bad addictions out there. I'll quit soon, anyway.
It's pretty easy to stop drinking non-diet soda and fast food, though. Microwaveable food is easier to get than fast food and often tastes better.

I'm just saying that there are some downsides of having a girlfriend, bro. she believes really heavily in clean eating and nags me like my mom when I want to get take out pizza

She's very wrong about what healthy food is. If she made you eat truly healthy food you wouldn't want goyslop at all anymore

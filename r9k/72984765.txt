Is using 4chan from a young age or in general really damaging to your mental health

>>72984765 (OP)
it's probably not good for you; just keep in mind that reality isn't how it's represented on 4chan. avoid swallowing the blackpill and always keep improving yourself when you can, then you can probably enjoy 4chan in moderation

Yes, been here since 19, now I'm a 34 year old NEET virgin with no friends living with my parents

I came her at 20 and it fucked me up and changed my views and opinions on things but I'm still glad I didn't come here when I was 10 or 12 in 2007 or something, those guys that did are trannies or pozzed faggots now and they're brains are permanently destroyed
--- 72984797
Using or not using would not have changed how people treated me growing up. Even if I had no internet or knowledge of this place I still would have been born with the jesters privilege. I would still have uncontrollable passion in my heart that the system wants to destroy.

TLDR; Places like this are symptoms not causes.

>>72984765 (OP)
lol no
If anything it helped me to become less autistic so I don't end up like you faggots lmfao.
--- 72984820
no
I was always like this so I might as well have fun in my degeneracy
t. started browsing at 15 years old and is now 18

>>72984765 (OP)
Made me more anti-social and hopeless and that I'd never make it in normalfag world and that I'd never, ever get a gf. I went from not even having an internet connection to finding 4chan and using it everyday. This was back in 2008 when I was 18. 4chan is completely different now, way more of a reddit normalfag site now.

Eh, I was always a bit of a weirdo since I was a kid. First heard of 4chan when I was 12 because I was a weeb, started lurking when I was 14 and now I'm 21. I frequent hobby boards the most. If anything it warned me about much weirder people out there.
--- 72984850
>>72984765 (OP)
I was always fucked. I may have had a chance at turning things around in high school and college of not for 4chan but even before I found this shit hole I was a anti-social loser who spent all his time playing video games, watching anime and browsing the net. 

I've been here since I was around 17
--- 72984886
>>72984820
So you're still 15 and have been here 3 weeks? Makes sense. I've been here 10 years now and I ended up just find. Comes to show the problem isn't 4chan, its your personal weakness and retardation.
--- 72984896
>>72984797
You dont think 4chan is just going to make it worse?
--- 72984904
>>72984886
no I'm actually 18 (eighteen) years old
when I was underage I would never talk about my age and when asked about it I'll just leave the thread but I no longer have to
--- 72984906
>>72984896
If you're stupid enough to take advice from 4chan no shit it's going to make your life worse. If you use it to lol at retards and find ways to learn from others' failures it's pretty fucking useful.
--- 72984913
>>72984904
>when asked about it I'll just leave the thread
>he's too stupid to lie on the internet
Yeah I think that's why your life is shit. Stop blaming 4chan for your low IQ.
--- 72984928
I would have still been looking at porn and gore regardless of if I found 4chan. Before 4chan I had rotten.com to see some nasty shit and the entire pre-pornhub internet to watch women get fucked in the ass.
--- 72984931
>>72984913
lying is cringe
and why are you making things up in your head did you have a nightmare about me or something ?
--- 72984945
>>72984765 (OP)
I've been on here since I was 13 and I think so, but only a little. It gave me a place to say whatever I want but now I literally cannot interact with normies at all. I barely could before (autism and sundry other mental illnesses) but it definitely fucked me up a little. Also I lost my only friend when I was 15 because I kept ranting about jews. I think it only has a negative effect on you if you're already different in some way. A giganormie using 4chan won't suddenly turn into a robot.
--- 72984985
>>72984765 (OP)
Yes. Remember Anon:They are using you.

Im deleting the website for all my mobiles as we speak. Im ready to ACTUALLY start life.

We Can All Make It.

>>72984765 (OP)
i don't understand the focus on 4chan as opposed to social media in general
--- 72985053
>>72985033
Because 4chan is social media, but for negative, pessimistic social outcasts while regular social media is for normalfags to meet up and fuck.
--- 72985077
Been here since 14, am 24 now. It was and remains a double barrel shotgun to the brain. You'll knit yourself back together and relearn normality but you're always going to be desensitized relative to other people. "What if I was just a sweet, normal kid like everyone else" is a pretty constant question when I consider the past I've accumulated and whatever future remains
--- 72985108
>>72984765 (OP)
I would have never found any appeal in this site in the first place if I wasn't already mentally ill. At times when I'm not horribly suffering from mental illness, I naturally desire to leave this place, and do so easily.
As for all the dumbass shit constantly posted here, I've never been brainwashed by any of it because I'm not a moron.
--- 72985124
>>72985077
why does normality matter?
--- 72985144
>>72985124
Other people gatekeep literally everything behind it? doooyyyy
--- 72985147
>>72984765 (OP)
I was fucked anyway so it didn't change much, definitely could see it being harmful for certain people though
--- 72985462
>>72984896
I think that the seeds of corruption are present before coming here but if you do take certain things to heart you will unwittingly water those seeds and the roots will go deeper and deeper until they actually can not be torn out.
--- 72985492
>>72984765 (OP)
No, it's not damaging to your mental health. If anything it makes you more resilient to the shit it displays to you.
--- 72986277
>>72984765 (OP)
Probably not as bad as porn.
--- 72986312
>>72984765 (OP)
Been here since I was 12 and I just turned 28. On/off, I browse like once a year now but was a heavy user in the past. 

Idk lole, it depends. It's just a massive waste of life and a nonstop flow of stupid opinions and worthless jnformation
--- 72986340
I have been to every big social media and if you aren't part of a small tight community then they will make you go insane all the same. I'd argue that twitter is worse than 4chan because you know some people here are trolling.
--- 72986353
>>72986312
>a nonstop flow of stupid opinions and worthless jnformation
what else is there?
--- 72986377

Be happy rolling that boulder up that hill

I climb rocks 20 hours a week. The unexamined life is actually far superior.
--- 72986407
yes it is fine. continue using it :')
--- 72986653
>>72984765 (OP)
No imo, I unironically find most of the senpais here quite friendly and wholesome. Yes you get a lot of degeneracy here but that's not so bad honestly, that's just what happens when a bunch of losers are anonymous and can share their deepest and darkest secrets, it's really not a bad thing desu. People in this thread act like people here are le evil boogeyman or something.

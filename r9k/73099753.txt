Weird strawman. People who most strongly believe in the former advocate for suicide and euthanasia and we call them anti-natalists. Maybe try browsing reddit or some other faggot spaces to fact check your faggot opinions before posting here.

On a side note it would be funny how easily accessible euthanasia would expose attention whore whiners pretending to be suicidal.

Man. You are a fag. Also OP is too. So teenager tier thinking. Both of you are homos.

Let's just take all of that was said as facts. Let's ignore plausibility of God, disregard questions like "what is consciousness?" etc Then what are we left with?

With quite a lot, actually. Logically thinking. All food, drinks you take and experiences gained by doing so all are greater than void. Even constant suffering is better than nothing. Neither of you really can even start to fathom how terrible nothingness is. When you are lucid and about to die from suicide, the only emotion you'll feel is regret. 

Far scarier than hell for me is void. Hell isn't too bad. It's silence that really fucks with you.

Jesus/god is real and doesn't want you to commit suicide, and Jesus would be against modern psychology too.

>WAAA LIFE IS TOOOO HAAAAARD I'M GOING TO GIVE UP EVEN THOUGH I'M IN MY YOUTH AND HAVE TRIED BARELY ANY STRAGETEGIES TO COPE OR IMPROVE MY LIFE WAAAAAA
This is demonstrably untrue, you only think this because you are weak. If you want to end your life because of momentary suffering then no one is going to stop you, it's not anyone else's responsibility to make life easy for you. Life has always been hard, it's always been up to the individual to create their own destiny. No one is forcing you to be a little histrionic pessimistic nihilist atheist faggot. You can believe there's no inherent meaning in life and still choose to live and enjoy life, millions of people do it. Realistically, an agnostic position is the most logical position to take anyway. An atheist position is just as illogical and magical as a theist position, you can't prove God does or doesn't exist because he would be a being that is so unknowable, ineffable and great that to think that anyone could perceive him without his will is laughable. You can't prove the existence of something that is supposed to be transcendent and unknowable. You can argue that the flying spaghetti monster might as well be real at that point and I suppose we can't prove the existence or non existence of that entity either but I'd hope you would be intelligent enough to understand that thousands of years of tradition lend at least some amount of legitimacy putting old religions above modern inventions even if it's so miniscule that it should be disregarded. Atheists don't understand it's not possible for science to disprove the existence of a God at this point in time, maybe in a few hundred years it will but right now the best argument we have is either for agnosticism based on logic or theism or non theistic religion based on personal experience.

Take those same people and out them in a crowd that has the opposite opinion and watch them change their identity especially if reddit goes away.
--- 73100330
>>73100182
Then you haven't truly suffered yet.

>anon, do you imply that you got terminal cancer that caused bone fragments to poke at your brain tissue, sending pain signals throughout your nerveous system 24/7? Then how can you claim that nothingness is worse?

Well. Pain always has a limit. People with conditions like aforementioned, do not tend to live for very long. With physical pain like that, think every one of us would certainly wish to die soon and death would be very close. Death also is something that happens to everyone. 

We probably may never know if we'd be able to get used to pain like that. What would the end result be? I imagine like some form of serious retardation. Even so, then the person has reached "void" state and pain ceased existing.

I can sort of tell from experience. I used to experience the worst mental pain imaginable. (losing 2 lol matches in a row) There were moments I wished to die. But my pain was only mental, and I stubbornly chose to endure. Now I don't feel shit. lol

It is far worse from what I had. I miss sadness and pain.

Thats literally everyone. Most people don't have balls to preach against the crowd. They live amongst Natalists is the reason they found refuge in cringe reddit communities and the most honest of nihilists. You might hate this fact but the people that genuinely believe in le life doesnt matter bullshit absolutely support the right to murder yourself.
--- 73100369
>>73100334
If they were truly anti-natalist they would kill themselves. There are also people out there that most certainly do have the balls to preach against the crowd.

Then what's the point in keeping alive and forcing them to go through all that, you fucking retard?

I can say the same for OP and most people who pretend to be so suicidal held back by angelic normies flying them up to the bridge whenever they jump.Afaik they would be definitely up for easy access to euthanisia as it has been there stance for a long while

You seriously are really dishonest person, you know that? Also, rude. Bet you must act that way, so you can feel more important than you are. Where did I ever advocate for that they (((should))) be kept alive?

Think the reason is that... Well, they are going to die soon anyway. 2 weeks or so max. Often we are only talking about days. There is always an insanely low chance that they'll recover for 1 year, then symptoms raise to the same level again. Remember, I do not refer to any specific condition. Not the brain one.

Think the attitude is like...
>hey, maybe we'll learn something important from this. So might as well give "aid" for 2 weeks and keep the person high as fuck on painkillers.

Think you would make a stronger argument for ((euthanizing)) vegetables aka brain-dead people. Should try that, since you clearly prefer being an edgelord rather than coming up with good arguments. Fucking teenager.

Unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. And NDErs talk about God running the afterlife. Therefore God exists. And NDErs talk about how the meaning of life is to learn to love and be kind and thrive here despite how hard it is in this world. And anyone who commits suicide go straight to paradise when they die anyway just like everyone else.

Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:

https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]

It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 

>"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."

Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE you realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.

Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:

>"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."

Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.

If before life doesn't exist then after life doesn't exist

>woman has some batshit entirely irrational view based on nothing more than hearsay
Talking to women is like sprinting through a minefield, like i want to show them how retarded 90% of the things they believe are(or at least the reasons they believe), but if i do theres approximately 0 chance of ever going anywhere with them

This is a rare instance in where the girl you've met is actually smarter than you and more well researched yet you're not even aware of this. Anyone who believes the moon landings were real is a lost cause. You've found a treasure you cannot possess nor even know the value of.

She set out feelers for a vibe check and you failed it. I'm sorry but you weren't meant to be with her to begin with.

Whether the video is fake or not is still up for debate, so that's an understandable position. Furthermore, going to the moon served no purpose other than getting a win, and the means of doing so were simply absurd. Faking it would have made the most sense to everyone involved.
OP, you may not be smart enough for a conspiracy theory gf.

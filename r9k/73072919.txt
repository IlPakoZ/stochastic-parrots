I was born in an upper middle class household in a non anglo country, went to a private school and then went to a target university to study engineering.

Years ago I was called to be an election monitor with 4 other people, 3 of them women of lower/middle class. Needless to say, people there treated me as a GOD due to my socioeconomic status (even though it's only upper middle), and the women would not stop hitting on me even thouh they had bfs!

So it got me thinking, are incels low status? many l them are NEETS at least
--- 73072942
I'm an Oxbridge grad, so supposedly part of society's elite.
I certainly don't feel like it, nor am I treated like it.

This entire board is marked for me. Should I just end it now?
--- 73072991
>>73072919 (OP)
Basically same situation but women don't treat me like a god. I hid my socioeconomic status at university because reason. People realized anyways, but girls don't hit on me. Okay maybe they do but I am retarded so I reject them or not pick up the clues. I live in a limbo between incel and volcel, so that's to be expected I guess

--- 73073135
>>73073051
Sure, but women still treat me the same as before I went.

>>73073086
No, my family's never been particularly well off. Not destitute, but slightly above qualifying for free school meals.
--- 73073156
>>73072919 (OP)
Expected worse, socially avoidant btw.
I have no idea how to escalate something to be intimate, especially with a woman.
I don't really have any family, most of my friends are online, and I barely ever meet up with the ones that aren't.

Yeah, I have three people I am in contact with, we don't hang out or talk much but we message online. Overall I think I'm used to be being alone anyway, I just learn to keep myself busy with college and my hobbies. What was your happy memory this month if you don't mind me asking?

What university you go to doesn't measure your intelligence, just your wealth
Smart middle class people go to smaller unis on scholarships
Smart poor kids get into larger schools on financial aid while all types of upper class kids get mommy and daddy to pay to let them in
--- 73073585
I dropped out of high school, did not go to college and have never had a job. My mom works retail. Never met my father.

Me too. It seems odd to be near other people most of the time. 
>What was your happy memory this month if you don't mind me asking?
This is sad but it was being at work this Easter my boss gave me some left over beef he made and I got to talk to my crush for a little bit and it was just a chill day.
>>73073441
I once had a female friend who would hug me too anon but I haven't seen her since 2019. We would flirt sometimes but she's got a bf and kids now so why bother anymore.

>>73073626
Thanks annon. I do try to keep occupied when I have idle time. I guess you could say I have hobbies. 
I would like to eventually work more for myself and less for others, since my surplus labor is only benefiting those who would shun and oppress me
--- 73073815
>>73072919 (OP)
Actually I feel terrible being rude to Rose and her family. If they could help me out financially I would agree to be friends with them. The only stuff I dont want to do is do stuff with her kid or go places with them or hang around them or anything. I could use lots of help and I would be a great friend in return.

Bingo 

I geus am fucked up
But what did You expect 
As a mentally handicapped retard
It shouldn't be different 
Is that am forced to take care
Of my autistic brother 
Other wise I probably trown myself 
Of my flat building or jump in front 
Of a train 

The only feeling I had that felt semi real.where death experiences where
True pain was all my body could sense
And suffercating while I chocked on my own blood after being driving over or stabbed was the nices feeling and thing I had death and being cold was nice almost comfy

I hate the fact they kept on reanimated me back like a fucking Frankenstein 
Shit if I had the choice I would just let me decay and pass on as the pice of shit I am they forced me back in life where
There where engeuf times
I could have being done in this insufferable life 

Everything is fucking and money 
Nothing is real its all fake as Hell 
Your bitching about GF,s those whores are succubuses tormenting You into pure madness 

They told me because I won't cut my dick aren't black and won't fuck animals childeren or corpses I don't matter 
Well shit they feel so good in there bullshiting cancel culture delusions 

People and this world is Vile and evil
The darkness feels more than home than the light ever did I feel most comfreteble
Hiding in a dark room knowing someday I may leave this cancer You call living 

You cucks simps and faggots piss me off 
You are the reason this Hell continued and I hate You people all for it

I didn't expect to get a bingo lol. And I'm sure there is some degree of correlation with low social status and inceldom. But I recall seeing last year a few job/income threads and there was quite a few of stemcels and some went to ivy leagues as well. I doubt it's entirely a class/status issue but having low of either doesn't help. Being a NEET or a minimum wagie loner won't help in the competition with attraction compared to let's say a hedge fund manager friends who golf's with his colleagues. So no, not all incels are low status/class but being low in either doesn't help.
--- 73076048
i don't feel lonely anymore because i realized i don't really have the capacity to feel sympathy. like, whenever someone tells me about a bad thing that happened to them, i try to act concerned or sad because that's what's expected, but i'm never actually sure what i'm supposed to feel.
so if i did somehow manage to find a girlfriend, for example, that relationship would probably end very quickly.
is that my mind subconciously coping or something else?
--- 73076222
>>73072919 (OP)
>So it got me thinking, are incels low status? many l them are NEETS at least
Not incel, but I am considered precariat in my country (below even the working class), although culturally I am middle class. Low status men get fucked all the timel, they just fuck low status women.

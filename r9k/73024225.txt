Why does your mind take you to places and put you in situations you genuinely would never want to be fully lucid when you're horny? Why does the brain fog push your moral and ethical inhibitions so far? Is sex drive the strongest human emotion?

Discrete emotions theory is worth reading about. Different emotions have their own action tendencies, and so which emotion is the "strongest" really depends on the situation

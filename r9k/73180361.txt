Don't worry bro, I'm here. You're only second place, now. How does it feel, having your first place trophy taken from you like this? Knowing that I just mogged you utterly in something you were sure you were best at? You're too much of a handsome chad for this thread now, so get the fuck out. It's peak ugly only hours and you're too good looking to qualify. Out.

I'm consistently one of the tallest and best looking dudes in a room. Made little to no difference in my life. No one cares, dude.

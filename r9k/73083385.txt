Absolutely sickening bullshit the gold-digging gf has been pulling again

Checked the client after getting up and first thing i see is that she's deleted the entire chat history from before (which i've saved in advance incrementally, since i knew she'd pull something like this)

Also essentially ignored the deadline i gave her, which is why i've canceled the other appointment

The rest of it was basically the usual predictable gold-digger nagging, so i've thrown the gauntlet down for a second time and told her to cut it the fuck out if she wants the relationshit to continue and what have you

I've really done absolutely everything i could to try and save this now (including pointing out the psychology on why her subconscious is driving her to trash the whole thing), here's hoping the bitch makes up her mind for good soon rather than wasting both of our time with this sickening bullshit she keeps pulling out of the blue. Fuck women kek

One thing i really don't get either is why she keeps sending me these unflattering pictures/close-ups of herself too 

All she does by doing this is to advertise the fact that she's already hitting the wall very hard in her early 30's (as is par for the course for her ethnicity)

5-10 years from now she'll have NO sexual market value left to speak of whatsoever, kek

It'd be stupid as shit of her to trash our whole thing, but then again she's a woman so she's probably incapable of reflecting on this in the first place

IT is the easiest way, but generally you have to have some level of competence to get full WFH, and there's no shortage of helpdesk spackers with no work ethic to hire and fire for chump change. So my advice is to get a job in IT, work in it for ten years and then you might get the freedom to work from home when you want to.

In 1943, wartime vehicle restrictions forbid personal cars on the road, so Hofmann had no choice but to get home on two wheels - though he had, luckily, asked his assistant to escort him home. During the infamous bicycle ride, Hofmann really tapped into the psychic effects of the drug. His assistant said they traveled home safely and at a rapid rate, and Hofmann recanted the event in great detail in his book. "Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux," he wrote. "It was particularly remarkable how every acoustic perception, such as the sound of a door handle or a passing automobile, became transformed into optical perceptions. Every sound generated a vividly changing image, with its own consistent form and color."

Take this tip for a top shagger: women are not rational and don't often respond well to having their emotions questioned and 'overruled' by logic, no matter how common sense it seems to us.

To manipulate a woman you have to play them at their own game and tap into their emotions.

London isn't the type of place you can enjoy as an outsider, I used to know London people so have been to a few inside London parties and get togethers. If you're a tourist you'll quickly be spotted, it's difficult to wriggle into the seamy, seedy underbelly. But when you do it sure is good.

Saw a video a while back where SSM said he bought a new TV from a shop and they automatically passed on his details to TV Licensing. Is that common practice? I want to buy a new TV from Amazon and I'm wondering if they'll tell TV Licensing too

And you don't have a TV licence? I'm probably just being paranoid
--- 73090109

I think I had one at the time but I don't see any reason it'd trigger a check. Do you think they're monitoring all of your amazon purchases?
--- 73090114
>>73090031
You are fine. You dont need a TV license to own a TV. theyre just pushing people to get one out of the gate. You can say no thankyou and move on.

You dont need a TV license to own a TV. A TV license is for if you watch live programming. You can say youre not using the TV to watch BBC/live material. You could be using it as a PC monitor. 

Because youre not legally required to have a TV license when purchasing a TV I dont see how they can make you get one.

Fockin ell me laddies, the entire relationshit ALMOST went belly-up earlier, it was *this* fucking close to burning up really... But i've refused to pull the trigger, which has paid off in the end there

The gf also asking me again whether i'm ready to move to her cunt ""forever"" and live with her there (she's still living with her parents after all and doesn't pay any rent) and i was like "yeah sure, whatever floats your boat". 

Course this is kinda lowkey easier said than done, and i'm not sure this would be a feasible arrangement all things considered; Maybe if she actually gets preggers, otherwise i'm not really saying the payoff here... 

Gonna have to figure out some sort o' compromise here for sure until [redacted]. 

Also said that she's impressed about how "i'm the first man that actually wants to go all-in with her" (little surprise there i suppose considering the type of shit she's pulling, i myself am drawn to fucked-up intelligent women thoughbeit) and shit, which is the first genuine green flag i've gotten from her in some time - One that was sorely needed too. 

Cum the weekend i'll (probably) know for sure when and where the next meetup's going to be, if she's still playing ball by then that is and her period doesn't fuck up her mood or what have you heh

The aliens in Contact do this by transmitting the signal at a very special frequency that wouldn't occur naturally. This frequency, 4.4623 GHz is described as "hydrogen times pi (_)." The hydrogen line, which is a common observation in radio astronomy, is the frequency at which hydrogen atoms, the most abundant substance in space, emit radio waves (1420.40575 MHz). While there aren't a lot of loose hydrogen atoms in space (about one per cubic centimeter of interstellar space) space is vast. So, the collection of all those individual atoms makes for a powerful signal that can be easily detected by small radio telescopes.

I'm looking forward to meeting laurel. It's about time. The weather is getting better. Not too cold or hot. This will be a good opportunity to introduce myself. Maybe we can have a platonic relationship as she is taken. I've said some silly things here and I can only hope she'll understand me better in person. I'm going to bring something nice to her so she will always remember me. What that is will be between me and her.
--- 73096381
I wonder what made her pick the name "laurel"? Could it be the tree? A sense of achievement?
--- 73096413
That's it. I'll apologise in person. She'll think I'm a brave boy for doing that. She will have her boyfriend so she will feel safe.

Whores will get no respect from me when I'm outside. No you fucking stand on the bus. I'm not moving my bag. I value my bag more than some whore. What you gonna do about it bitch? Yeah nothing. You know I'll kick up a fuss. Know your fucking place in the hierarchy.
--- 73097391
I fucking hope that bitch gets salted again after so many helped rebuild the garden. Stop feeding druggie homeless scum you dosser.
--- 73097443
Imagine salting your own garden for attention and money. Grim.
--- 73097533
Yup fuck being a good little contributor just so I can pay for Chad and Stacy's childbirth costs and educating their spawn. Nope. No fucking way. Gimme them sweet disabilitybuxx so I can support the video games industry. Leech leech leech.
--- 73097563
I'm denied my primal rights to breed because women set a ridiculously high bar for their partners. All want fucking good looking Chads and I'm meant to just get on and never have any puss? No fuck that. Fuck contributing, fuck giving any respect to women anymore. Their lives are easy enough.

I've lived for over 30 years now and still didn't get love and sex. Of course I'm fucking angry. I have every right to be.

Just over a month on minoxidil for my facial hair. I notice hairs getting thicker, many new vellus hairs but they're almost translucent. Many many more months to go but decent thus far, hopefully by month 3 patches will be filled in and I can have a short beard

He's obviously happy so what's the problem? Would he be better off seething on 4chan in the corner of his otherwise empty room?

>>73098881
I enjoyed the night shifts, but also had to do day shifts every other week. Did 3 night shifts one week (fri sat sun 6pm-6am, finish monday morning and go to mcdonalds), then sat sun 6am-6pm. I swapped to working in the week, and that was a monumental mistake, as 1 week was 6am-2pm, the next 2pm-9pm. I drank more on the weeks of starting at 6am. I could never get to sleep >12am. I was drinking a lot of southern comfort, around 3L a week.
You a day shift wagie now? I had to stop working.

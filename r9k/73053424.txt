You're the only one who mentioned age, so I have to assume you're similarly old. So what's it like being a social reject whose life is half over?

This isn't true. I'm dating a 30 year old woman right now and the biggest thing she regrets is wasting her 20s partying and fucking guys. It's all she talks about. She's a fucking assistant barely making $30k because she dropped out of college due to her bf.

 She doesn't even know her body count and she said one of the reasons she fell in love with me was because I was one of the few people that gave her a chance

every older single woman has this mindset and its why im not going to reward women for fucking sexy guys instead of me in their youth

This lady is probably closer to 50 than 40. The problem is that most "discourse" on the internet is dominated by 15-30 year olds. The older crowd is just entering adulthood without the typical lifelines: marriage, home ownership, or even positive attitudes regarding heterosexual relationships. Of course someone who thought the 90s-2000s were wild doesn't think there is a problem: they didn't grow up with 2010s internet values.

Why are you putting up with her?
--- 73053659
>>73053492
Just drinking here and there is alright, but drinking everyday means something is bothering her. She drinks to keep negative thoughts that haunt her at bay.

Drinking everyday will do one no good and it's not worth it.

Been sober here for months now, gonna go for a year no drinking and maybe continue after that.

Shes 100% right. My grandma told me on her deathbed that getting married and settling down early was the worst mistake of her life. I was watching a video with a bunch of boomer women being interviewed about their regrets and all of them said they wish they had travelled more and had more sex and trysts with cute guys. Nobody on their death bed is going to regret having fun in their youth.

Your grandma was a whore who was rightfully married off to suppress her whore instincts.

because every time i signal i want to fuck a woman im creepy but other guys get to fuck women
so why the fuck would i commit to a woman who thinks im creepy
the ONLY type of woman who doesnt signal im creepy is a woman who is eighteen nineteen or MAYBE twenty years old with a low body count

Yeah a ton of sluts will not SAY they regret it, but the reality is that being a slut in their 20s almost certainly made their life a lot worse. They might not recognize that, either because they are too stupid or because they just can't handle the truth, but that doesn't change the reality.

>>73053766
because these women still have their youth so by giving me sex during their youth and a committed relationship they are signaling that i am sexually valuable
the ONLY way a modern woman can signal that i am sexually valuable is by fucking me during their youth SOLELY because of the mindset that is EXTREMELY common in the op post

I thought breeding was what your grandma did? So having children in a monogamous relationship is now something to aspire to rather than something you do after being a whore? Make up your mind buddy

Most women regret it when they get older.

Here's how the cycle goes:

20s: Woman is sleeping around fucking hundreds of guys, parties non-stop and is care-free

early 30s: Woman realises she is getting older and starts settling for men they perceive as low value

>late 30s: Woman is single, childless and alone and can't have kids anymore, decides to blame men for her own failures despite the fact that she chose this path.

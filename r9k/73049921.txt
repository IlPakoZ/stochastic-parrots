is there such a thing as anonymous text-only long distance relationship therapy/counciling ?

I mean for working on a LDR in anonymous text chat with potentially a human who might have a degree. For clarification.

I'm potentially a human who might have a degree.
Critically, I also have a copy of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders on my desk.

I always thought I was low key autistic or something, but never had it checked out because I can function fine.

It do be like that, anon. At least schizotypals can be pretty artistic people.

I think I may also be schizotypal

TFW didn't realise I had some autism until I finally wage-cucked at age 28-29. Now almost 37 (accepted I can never escape NEETdom/hermitdom) and am still not diagnosed. I had not heard of schizotypal, but I did think I was somewhat schizoid, given my lack of ability and now interest in socialising. I just want to stay on 'limited capability' NEETbux, now that I have it, and never attend an appointment again. UBI is the fucking dream.

I'm in the same boat as others here. Thought I might be autistic, and while I do see many similarities still, Schizotypal fits me 100%. Shit's fucked.
From one pov it's nice to know that you're weirdness isn't your fault, but it also means that there's nothing you can do about it, no way to fix it, you know?

Nah, it's worse since unlike autism, it's functional enough that there's no support system.

It's worse since unlike autism its a personality disorder

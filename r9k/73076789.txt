Is there ever any reasoning in the bible, or is it always "This is what it says, do it"

It's not even that, there's literally hundreds of different interpretations of the same book. If you visited several different churches you'd see variance and inconsistencies in their beliefs. It's wild, of course if you ask any of them, they will claim that their little niche is the true interpretation.

Would you guys date a Millennial/Gen X Woman and how well do you get along with them?

I am on the line between genz/millenial, but yes I would, I even was talking to a woman in her 30s earlier today. I honestly love mommy types, it's very attractive to me

I'm way less nervous around women that age than around other zoomer girls.

Not if they have weird gray nipples, WTF

28 and I dated a 35 year old woman. She was fine but she cried on the last night before I was supposed to fly home when I said I was not sure about long distance. So I buckled and it turned out to be shit since her friends were shitty and she was a real asshole especially she liked to down wine bottles every night. Every night I was with her, she would drink. She would call me insecure about it then get mad at me when I went to a club with my friends saying it made her worried. If you are not a drunk, I would date an older woman

Same for me. Do you also feel like Older women are less judgmental and actually care about what you have to say?

I seem to generally get along with millennial women, or women that identify with being millennial. You can tell irl who's a phoneposter and who goes on the computer.

I'm 21 and I would date older women if they were virgins. My only relationship experience is with a 30yo black lady from the UK. She's one of those workaholic shut-ins, she somehow got to 30 as a female virgin despite being attractive. She dumped me because here family kept giving her shit for getting a mail order husband, which is kind of racist honestly. Just because I'm from eastern europe doesn't mean I'm a mail order husband baka.

I was always teased by my aunts as a kid and that gave me a massive Milf fetish. It also didnt help that all my female family members are titmonsters

All men should only date and marry 10 year older women. This is the perfect relationship. Mans mother can rest assured that he is now taken care of,
by choosing and giving him to the best new mommy possible.
This is like freudian ideal. Also only older women can understand misunderstood autistic genius of most anons here, younger girls are semi-stupid anyway.

WOULD I! But, ya I would

>how well do you get along with them?
I think as long as they either have similar interests or are able to tolerate mine then we wouldn't have any major issues.

No, I'm a cunnyfag. Old hags disgust me.

I feel much more confident and relaxed around older women

Yes, and very well. Older women hit on me at work all the time. Usually the ones in their thirties. My plan is to find a millenial/gen x gf at the movies when I go to see Barbie 2023. Between now and then I'm training everyday with my Kenergy so I can get some rock hard abs

nta but mostly yes, I feel twice as comfortable with older women. As an early 20s zoom it feels like zoomer girls are fucking mind zapping and stealing my brain waves, it almost makes it impossible to be around them because they feel 10x more judgemental, even if that might not be the case. 
I've met very few zoomer girls who actually initiate talking and think that anything I say matters. 
It just feels like a superficial social game rather than feeling belonging in a community that older 30 year olds give off.

The only women who have ever hit on me in my life are older women. The young girls want nothing to do with me. It feels like I have to make a critical decision at some point...

Yes absolutely. Although I wouldn't want to marry one unless I manage to find the perfect lonely milf. Though a fwb situation sounds amazing to me.

I've been considering getting a dating app or using one of those "lonely milfs in your area" sites but I don't know where a good place to find them is

yeah i would, i think age is attractive and the brief intimate encounters i've had with women have always been older. I find it 10x more sexy when a woman has signs of age and still looks good, it gives some texture rather than a plain 20 year old 10/10. I tend to get on better with them than girls my own age who i find annoying, older women mostly seem to have calmed down. also it probably has something to do with having no siblings and not talking to girls at school so the only female interaction (and the ones who were nice to me) were with older women.

Boards are still allowed one (1) live meta thread, right? Have never seen one on /r9k/ before.
For those that don't know
>A meta thread is a thread that discusses the board itself
What's wrong with /r9k/? What's right with /r9k/? What do you think of /r9k/? How could /r9k/ be better?

They should hand out oodles of free money to me.

So you're trying to say that /r9k/ is a more personal dumping ground than /trash/ or /b/?

Apu, "sex haver" posters aren't /r9k/. You weren't here when the ">tfw no gf" meme started and there were 80+ threads that all read "tfw no gf" with the same sad pepe.

It's like interracial/blacked posting. That shit was running rampant in 2014/15 and that's when they reinstated the robot. Now it's just normal internet shit. It's like a pleasure singularity approaches in which calling someone a "degenerate" doesn't just mean "you don't agree with me" but actually means you're a degenerative human being.

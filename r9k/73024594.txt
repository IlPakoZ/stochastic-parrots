How do I find a gf who's really into pegging? And sph or femdom if I'm lucky.
I don't need a true femdom, just a switch girl who would peg me in-between me fucking her too.

>inb4 bdsm sites and meetups
tried this and I must be very unlucky because in my area it was ALL people over age 50. like WTF dude.

Just get a girlfriend and then tell her to peg you.

I've been wondering how to bring it up to my wife. So far it's just rimjobs and fingering but she's jokingly mentioned pegging a few times.

I do not want to have sex with men. I know people think that being into pegging is gay but it literally is different. If I try to get it up for a man it doesn't work. It has to be a woman penetrating me.
>inb4 just fuck trans women then
Closer, but still different from what I'm into. The dick has to be a strap on.

No woman is truly into femdom sorry. I tried telling my ex about just soft femdom stuff I was into and it changed how she viewed me and ultimately ruined our relationship. Most women who say their into it are just doing so because its trendy right now.

You don't need to get it up.

I'm sorry OP, but it's just luck. 

I practically won the lottery. My very first girlfriend was into everything femdom and had the forsight to lock me in a cage without even taking my virginity first. Haplily together twelve years this month :)

There's a girl I know who may be into me, she's actually physically stronger than me and has wrestled me unprompted multiple times. She seems into me and I wonder if she'd ever peg me.

Being upfront about having a kink would help even with a "normal" girl. All women are natural pleasers so she'll probably try it.

if you want to filter it outright, you need to put it in your bio, because bringing it up early in a first conversation is tough not to scare people away unless you were so hot you didnt have these problems

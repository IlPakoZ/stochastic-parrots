I have gone 15 weeks without masturbating, not even so much as a single stroke.

hey well done man, I havent been to this board in ages but its actually kinda nice to see your post in a sea of new neonur9k newfags

Thanks. When was the last time you browsed here?
--- 72977617
What's your goal in this endeavor?
--- 72977626
>>72977572 (OP)
I've gone so far 3 weeks without rubbing one out.
I feel like I can go for the entire year.

been since probably October that I've been a regular, this was the place I spent most days for a couple years though

Are you in a state of divinely assisted spiritual transformation or something? I, just like most of the dwellers here, am a coomer and can hardly go 2 days without masturbation. It's fucking impossible.

My goal was reaching 100 days so I can kill myself at some point in the near future while still on this current streak

Yeah. I mean Ive already gone almost 30% of it, but I definitely feel like I could easily go the remainder of 2023 without ever masturbating.

>>72977640
Well Im 30 years old, that probably helps things. I couldnt even go a few days without masturbating right up until my middle 20s.

In a way I'm cheating though I'm taking medication which I guess have an affect on my libido. I don't feel horny for 90% of the week.
--- 72977734
>>72977711
which med? Please
--- 72977752
>>72977711
Oh. What kind of medication? SSRIs? Yeah they crippled my sexdrive when I started taking them back when I was like 24. I went from jerking off 10 times a day on average to jerking off 2 times a day on average.

How do I get these drugs? Do I need to fake some mental illness? Also, does it affect only your sex drive, or is it like some tranny pill that takes away your test?

Amisulpride to treat my schizophrenia.
Somehow I don't know why but has affected my sexdrive like I said.
--- 72977823
>>72977779
What are the side effects? I need a magic nofap pill
--- 72977838
>>72977572 (OP)
lol i see this right after i just finished fapping
--- 72977854
>>72977773
Just tell them you are depressed and want to kill yourself. Its just Prozac. And no they also made me sleep 20 hours a day and I lost my appetite.
--- 72977892
>>72977854
Any non prescription over the counter ideas? My mom doesn't want me on drugs
--- 72977899
I have found that for me it works best to fap right before sleep once I have completed all my tasks for the day.

Combined with physical exercise a few times a week, and preparing most of my breakfast and lunch the evening before.

Otherwise uncontrolled I can fap 3-4 times a day easily. But my productivity crumbles. But going nofap too long leads me to become insane and I cant stop thinking about ass &amp; titties 24/7.
--- 72978021
desu it gets easier after a few days. when you brake a habbit and stop defaulting to fapping when bored, it stops being that hard. i did over a month without that much trouble, nothing changed really so i started again, and few weeks ago i stopped watching porn and fapped once or twice. i might fap today just to release the pressure, but honeslty, if youre not watching porn and fapping multiple times a day i dont think ocasional wank is that much of a problem. often no fap community focuses extremaly on this one issue but neglects diet sleep training and work/studies. by all means try nofap, stop watching porn (which imo is worse than just jacking off), see how you react, but dont expect magical changes if youre a neet and a slob.

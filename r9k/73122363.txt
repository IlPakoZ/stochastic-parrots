>A coronary artery spasm is a temporary tightening (constriction) of the muscles in the wall of an artery that sends blood to the heart. A spasm can reduce or block blood flow to part of the heart. If a spasm lasts long enough, you can have chest pain (angina) and even a heart attack. IF A SPASM LASST LONG ENOUGH, YOU CAN HAVE CHEST PAIN (ANGINA) AND EVEN A HEART ATTACK.
Bros, wtf, I don`t want to die. I`ve been having these spasm for a few months now. I sleep for 3-4 hours every day and I`m constatnly nervous and irritated. Should I at least go to sleep earlier?

>>73122363 (OP)
My heart skips beats and flutters sometimes for no reason, I got it all checked out and ultrasounds and everything a few years ago
Mine is harmless but annoying
You gotta drink enough water, and get enough sleep and youll be good
Also dont have loads of coffee, alcohol, or spend all night wanking either, those will all make it more common and thatll make sleep or relaxing more difficult, which makes it MORE common, and it spirals worse and worse till you fix it

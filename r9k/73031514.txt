i'm into compsci, i like literature and philosophy(existentialism, human nature) from the 18th to 19th century (mostly). interest in neuroscience. i haven't read much history directly, but i enjoy retracing things. i'm illiterate in reciting facts from x period.

What? Listing your interests and hobbies doesn't really give me a good idea into what kind of person you are. You can send me your tag if you want to chat.

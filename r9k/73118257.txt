You wouldn't give me the time of the day because im 5'8. Even if that was somehow ok you would dump me a few months later when you see my 5x4 inch dick. And even if all that was alright my autism would repel. You would resent me because I wouldn't beat you and treat you with reapect.

I've had crushes on guys who were average height, like 5'7" to 5'8". also, autism in men doesn't repel me. 
I don't approach any men because men irl kinda intimidate me, but I have noticed that whenever I do get approached, it's always a complete normie who likes rap and shit like that. only been in one relationship, he actually shared my interests, but I was too mentally ill lol.

ive been in romantic relationships since 2014. ive never gone longer than a month without a gf.
i am ALSO 5'8" and have been dumped because of my struggle with physical intimacy! THOUGH ive never become bitter about it because i know people have their boundaries and things they'd like to do. i just can't have sex without breaking down

You aren't asexual you have trauma. You are going to have to deal with that if you want healthy relationship.

No I would resent you because after saying all this bullshot you'd still dump me. Remember folks 90% of marriages fail when the woman out earns her man. Most robots here aren't making 120k a year so please just go away find someone in your league and let us rot in peace.

I am fine with someone earning more than me. But you wouldn't date someone who earns 5k less. Proving my point

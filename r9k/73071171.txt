Why does every single "gamer" girl only play Valorant and League?

I started off playing dota 2 and csgo because my older bro told me to get steam and he was already playing both of them. Ended up switching to league after 1200 hours on dota. Dont really like valorant, im excited for cs2!

Most literally do not
Most females who claim to enjoy games play things like sims and civ and animal crossing alone by themselves

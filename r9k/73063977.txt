How do I tell if a girl likes me? Like how do I know if a girl is just being nice to me or if she wants to be my gf?

There's this girl at work who I think she likes me but I can't tell for sure. Maybe you guys can help me figure things out.

When she spreads her legs and wants to hug you all the time. Women pretend to like you to get what they want.

While nearly impossible, best option is to stop think about it. If she was really deadset on getting you into her life or between her legs? It would happen without giving you doubt and making you question your every move. 
If she just 'likes' you and stops at signals and hidden hints, it only means "come entertain and peacock for me and maaaybe I'll play along and put out one day" 
Which is most of the time not really going to happen and only wastes your energy and time while making you feel like you walking on explosive eggshells when ever she is present. Not really shit you need at work of all places.

Usually you have to feel out the situation a bit, prolonged eye contact is usually a dead giveaway. Sometimes the girl is just an attention whore though and likes flirting, so be careful of those types, easiest way to tell if she's one of those is if she seems to flirt with lots of people other than you.

If she's nice to you she doesn't like you.

Best way is to have someone ask her (preferably another female) what she thinks of you.

>Hey Stacy what do you think of Anon?
>Do you think he's cute, handsome, etc?

That's how you'll no for sure without her rejecting you in your face.

If you don't know for sure, she dosen't want to have sex with you. Girls who want to have sex with you will come up to you, talk to you, practically sit on your lap. If you're not experiencing overwhelming encouragement and approval from her, just leave her the fuck alone.

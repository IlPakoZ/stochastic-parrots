I guess this is goodbye robots. I got the job. A part time gig for three months that potentially could turn into a full time 40k a year job. Office job. Very corporate. It looks like my NEETing days are finally over. I'm happy and I'm sad but mostly I'm just tired. I'm fucking exhausted. I didn't wanna go full wagecuck but I can't stand NEETing anymore. The depression. The monotony. Low self esteem. I can't do it anymore. I would have wound up dead. you robots have had a positive impact on my life

>want to NEET
>have to eat
i fucking wish i could at least have a fucking week of real peace
i deserve that after getting through uni and what i endured there, what i fucking lost because of it
but in the end i couldnt even get a fucking day

one fucking day of being alone and doing what i really want, without having to constantly worry about unfinished job that is due to yesterday

fuck this gay earth and this shitty fucking life
you either are born rich, or you just fucking lose

I'd take it too if I ever had such an opportunity, no fucking chance though. Good luck to you, hope to never see you in this miserable place ever again.

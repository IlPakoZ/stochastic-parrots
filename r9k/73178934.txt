Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm Truman and everyone is laughing at my misery. It feels like people on the internet are also just actors.

yeah it feels like i'm one of the few who see how retarded TV, social media and socialization has become. how shit all of human history is. how similar we still are to chimps.
feels like i'm one of the few sane people left but thats what all loons say.

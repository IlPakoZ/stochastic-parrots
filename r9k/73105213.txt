I'm an 20 year old dude who's never really been sexually interested in humans. I'm into furries and other related weird shit, but I always made a clear distinction between that and bestiality. Animals can't consent and aren't self-aware so it'd be like taking advantage of them, which is messed up.

I got a kitten a few months back to help with some of my depression issues. She's a really smart, cute-ass cat with a lot of personality, and she's basically my favorite thing in the world. She's ~7mo old now, and a couple of days ago she started acting really bizarre. Noisy, way more affectionate than usual, etc. Turns out she's in her heat cycle.

So this cat has been wiggling her ass in the air, rubbing up against me, and making these adorable god damn trilling noises for the past few days. She's an indoor kitty and I definitely don't want her doing it with some mysterious neighborhood cat and getting pregnant, but she seems kind of "frustrated" (probably just me personifying her) and, as fucked up as it seems, I wish I could... help her out? idk. It's been in the back of my head all day.

This is really worrying me because I'm basically fantasizing about banging my cat, which is really messed up. I'll be drawing or whatever and suddenly get these crazy zoophilic intrusive thoughts that leave me feeling ashamed and generally really gross. I'd never, ever act on my impulses, but the thoughts themselves are freaking me out.

I don't know what to do. I'm embarrassed to even be telling the internet, let alone a therapist... I seriously doubt I could do it. Should I get rid of the cat? Am I a terrible person for this?

Intrusive thoughts mean zilch. Masturbate to something often enough and you will develop another fetish. So, get your mind off of this shit you furry retard. Get a fleshlight if you need a hole.

quit all of your furry porn shit and start watching hentai or porn that doesn't involve animals. Also whatever happens don't fuck your cat, if you do that you'll feel remorse for the rest of your life

You probably shouldn't fuck your cat, I'm assuming cats can't take human dicks. Applying the human concept of consent to animals is reddit behavior though

Look up videos on YouTube for that shit. They will teach you how to use a cotton swab on a cat's ass

Well she clearly wants to have sex and is sexually frustrated. Why not try and help her out and see where things go? Not like anybody is ever gonna find out

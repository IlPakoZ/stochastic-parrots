If you're not very attractive, you need to learn how to act in public, anon. It sucks but that's reality.

Do not interact with women

Sadly it's true. Be humble and awkward/shy if you're ugly and chuddy. Just accept it's how things are and don't overstep or people will get alarmed, especially women.

It's your entire incel aura, not just the snack. And besides, it could have been laced with poison for all she knows. Respect her boundaries in future.

Funny, in my first ever job, a female coworker literally grabbed my arm asking "how are you feeling?"

She's done a lot more creepy and mean things, but the point is double standard is real.

Your either kidding or you're a total fucking moron. If it's the latter, I recommend you learn to stop being such a faggot.

It means you don't do anything for women at work besides talk about work stuff and do work stuff.

This is the only reasonable advice. Say good morning, goodbye and talk only about work related stuff.

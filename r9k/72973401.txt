Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.

>are Dom Nis psychic?
I think our predictive abilities are more of a pattern recognition thing - subconsciously picking up on little domino effects and on some level noticing when things have lined up fortuitously or gone awry, then using this experience to navigate similar problems in the future despite seemingly never having experienced the problem before. I also think the wombo-combo of introversion and perception dominance can make someone delusional and catastrophizing in a way that people associate with some sort of greater knowledge or awareness.
>what do you think of Dom Ni users?
Based schizos. Some are insufferably pretentious, though.
>what are some myths about Ni users?
We still make our decisions with some relation to objective reality. It is warped in service of the ego but never completely removed like certain posters like to say
>in what ways do you defy Ni stereotypes?
I'm a cranky old man but not that cranky of an old man. Very childish and playful when I get comfortable around someone.
>how angry does it make you when people pretend to be Ni users who are anything but?

>is Ni better than Ne?
All of the extroverted functions are probably "better" in an objective sense, but personally neither the live fast die young Ne dominant lifestyle or 300 iq but can't get out of bed Ne aux behaviors appeal to me more than.. whatever this is.

>are Dom Nis psychic?

I would say they are the people who are most likely being able to see/enter the astral plane. That can be a problem if one is confused about it and may think "am I schizo?", but when this talent is used in a proper way, it gives access to an actual other world, that is not less real than the material world. The "psychics" have to get used of that, of course, when they live in a society where it is not so much desired when a person can see ghosts and spirits, and astral-travel to other realms. But they are the visionaries and spiritual guides in humankind. It's not an easy but an interesting life.

Wanna peek at intuition in a fresh and discernible way?

Intuition: Scientific, Non-Scientific or Unscientific? 
[.....] 
>there will always be knowledge remaining in the non-scientific bucket, containing whatever science did not prove (yet) to be right or wrong
>Unfortunately, those who worship science, have a tendency to treat the non-scientific bucket in the same manner as the unscientific one, dismissing its content as wrong, without well-founded evidence. Even though it may not always be possible to differentiate immediately in which knowledge bucket a particular explanation (or part of an explanation) belongs, this should not lead to a premature assumption that the explanation is unscientific. Intuition is one such phenomenon.
[.....]
> WHY INTUITION SCHOLARS AND INTUITION PRACTITIONERS SEE DIFFERENTLY
>The main difference between the views of intuition practitioners and intuition scholars is in the way they think about sensory inputs. Intuition practitioners aim at attaining insight into hidden truths through immersing themselves in a phenomenon, thus the focus is on the personal (individual) experience. This means taking the subjectivity to the extreme in order to reach understanding. In contrast, intuition scholars, at least traditionally, aim at attaining insight into hidden truths by getting rid of everything personal and subjective, and penetrating the phenomenon in an impersonal objective way. As Schrodinger (1958) argues in his discourse on the so called 'scientific method', science is also ultimately sensory-based: even if we design a machine that designs another machine that does the measurement and the processing in itself, there is still a starting point somewhere, where the initial machine was designed by a human using sensory-based approach. Similarly, there is also always a human interpretation of the outcome at the end of whatever data the machines collected and processed, which is why Gummesson (2003) claims that all research is interpretive.
--- 72977448
>>72977439
[.....]
>COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF INTUITING: SENSING + SENSEMAKING
>Both intuition scholars and intuition practitioners acknowledge that some interpretation takes place as a part of the intuiting process. We call this the sensemaking aspect of intuiting.
>This sensemaking can be described by five of the six characteristics identified by intuition scholars: it is rapid, holistic, alogical, based on tacit processing, and carries intrinsic certainty.
>We have identified one characteristic on which intuition scholars and intuition practitioners disagree when describing the way intuiting works: intentionality. Intuition practitioners' explanation allows for a possibility that the intuiting process can be initiated on cue, while the scholarly explanation claims that intuition is spontaneous, not allowing for intentionality. 
>This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the scholarly view disregards the sensory aspect of intuiting, while for intuition practitioners, intuiting is rooted in the sensory, and it is in the sensory realm where intentionality of intuiting process can be achieved. Although intuition as an outcome is naturally spontaneous, the process of intuiting may or may not be spontaneous; it is plausible that practice-based and scholarly explanations address different phases of the intuiting process.
>Looking at the process of intuiting, the product of which is intuition, we divide the process of intuiting into sensing and sensemaking.
>On the input side of sensing, there are sensory signals, which in the process of sensing are transformed into sensations. These sensations, tacit or explicit, are the inputs of the sensemaking process, the output of which is meaning. Thus the process of intuiting, described as 'sensing + sensemaking', produces 'sensations with meaning', that is, intuition. While not all 'sensation with meaning' is intuition, all intuition is 'sensation with meaning'.
--- 72977462
>>72977448
>This also explains why intuiting is tightly linked with domain expertise in the scholarly view: domain experts are competent at interpreting all sorts of inputs within their area of expertise. Ignoring the sensing aspect of intuiting makes concept of intuiting incomplete
[...]
>The sensing phase of intuiting can be improved through developing physical, emotional, and intellectual self-awareness, while the sensemaking phase can be educated through increasing domain expertise or context expertise (Dorfler &amp; Stierand, 2017; Sinclair, 2010; Sinclair et al., 2002).
>The Western educational system is fully focused on the latter, while the sensing is systematically repressed (Bergson, 1911; Hogarth, 2001). Top professionals in any area of expertise - be it musicians, chefs, athletes, designers, or scientists - are esteemed precisely for their 'sense of the game' in their domains, even when formally they are recognized for expertise (Bruner, 1977: 67), so sensing is worth developing along with sensemaking in order to achieve highest levels of performance.

>There is no scientific evidence that contradicts the claim of the intuition practitioners' view that intuiting can be originated intentionally, as well as spontaneously. This means that intuition practitioners' claim of possible intentionality of intuiting belongs in the non-scientific bucket, rather than in the unscientific one, and with further research, it has potential to move to the scientific bucket, provided that the sensing + sensemaking model of intuiting sustains scientific scrutiny.
https://pure.strath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/102673477/Dorfler_Bas_Elgar_2020_Intuition_scientific_non_scientific_or.pdf (I recommend to at least skim the full source)

In relation to "expertise," it may be good to outline that what intuiting may be about is developing and working through field of personal understanding, rather than operating with what is just personally known.

--- 72977776
>>72977462
Not that acquisition of knowledge could necessarily be excluded from the processes of intuiting, but the aspect of understanding seems to be overlooked and everywhere I look.

And bonus commentary:
I assess this would also explain the phenomena of "revelations of problems of objectivity sometimes coming in dreams rather than in a state of wakefulness" - it's consequence of intuition immediately working with what integrates into what's understood (and, specifically through this way, memorized) by the mind.
https://www.news-medical.net/health/Role-of-Sleep-in-Memory-Consolidation.aspx#4
>newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS [slow-wave sleep] and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. 
>the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems*
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768102
>we posit that a function of sleep is to optimize the consolidation of sequence-based knowledge (the when) and the establishment of semantic schemas of unordered items (the what) that underpin cross-linguistic variations in sentence comprehension
>sleep is involved in the construction of predictive codes, a unified principle of brain function that supports incremental sentence comprehension

(*worth noting that intuition may be a multi-system process, rather than brain/gut-specific one)

Last one for sleep-understanding-intuition axis:

Sleep inspires insight
>Insight denotes a mental restructuring that leads to a sudden gain of explicit knowledge allowing qualitatively changed behaviour
>we show a facilitating role of sleep in a process of insight. Subjects performed a cognitive task requiring the learning of stimulus-response sequences, in which they improved gradually by increasing response speed across task blocks. However, they could also improve abruptly after gaining insight into a hidden abstract rule underlying all sequences. Initial training establishing a task representation was followed by 8h of nocturnal sleep, nocturnal wakefulness, or daytime wakefulness. At subsequent retesting, more than twice as many subjects gained insight into the hidden rule after sleep as after wakefulness, regardless of time of day.
>Sleep did not enhance insight in the absence of initial training. A characteristic antecedent of sleep-related insight was revealed in a slowing of reaction times across sleep. We conclude that sleep, by restructuring new memory representations, facilitates extraction of explicit knowledge and insightful behaviour
https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02223
(the authors conflate knowledge and understanding, though)
>Mendeleyev, who laid out the periodic table of chemical elements, reported that his understanding of the critical rule underlying it emerged out of a dream
>The Number Reduction Task (explained in Fig. 1a) was adopted from ref. 18. Before the experiment proper, subjects had to perform without mistakes on ten practice strings to assure correct understanding of the 'same' and 'different' rule. The hidden rule was abstract, that is, dependent on relational patterns rather than on fixed stimulus-stimulus or stimulus-response repetitions as in classical conditioning or in typical serial reaction-time tasks

I need a dream analyst to give a soul reading.

I wake up at 1pm, and say hmmm. It's important I sleep one more time. I wake up at 1:30pm and had this dream that is the timeline.

I am in my bedroom, but it's quite dirty. I have a girl she comes in to move in and we sleep together the first night, she is in the form of my first girlfriend. Suddenly, she comes home with a boy and they are sleeping together on the bed. I'm very angry about this, as I've been forced into sleeping on the floor while they're on the bed. Finally I break, I scream at the guy he needs to go. I start packing his shit and tossing it out. Both the boy and girl are acting confused, I'm screaming telling them to get out. I walk out to the main room of the house and there are 4 or 5 roommates, I tell them I'm kicking this stupid bitch out since she's a cheating whore and they are all supportive and excited about it. Two of them grab guns, two of them have bow and arrows and they're just pointing them at the boy.

Eventually I get all their shit out of my room and my room is clean now, I have 3 desks, 3 chairs, a bed, 3 computers, and everything is set up pristine. The boy was all being a whiny bitch saying he only ever did this because I didn't give him a birthday present, but I did give him a birthday present and I showed him the memory. He was shocked that it was true and then vanished. The girl was still there for a time before finally she left also. Returning to my prostine room I close the curtains, one of them I look outside and China is right there, like Beijing was right out the window there is a huge redroofed building and stars and a military car patrolling which the drivers duck down when they see me. I close that window too and go outside where my housemate asks me how I did it? And I said did what? He asked did I write it down? And I asked what it was? And then we all ate cheese together.

So what is it?

Gotta say, I mildly, gently, delicately, complexly and nuanced-ly abhor the self-proclaimed parasocial fan club presidents who retain absolutely jack shit about longtime posters' true personalities, histories or cognitive preferences, while projecting inaccurate or outright shit takes. Sometimes, propping up a persona the "Regular" has laid foundation for already, contributing; in other cases, taking a personal desire and running with it, because seemingly the existing public persona fits the preexisting individual fantasy best --paperdoll-crimping the tabs of the person they want to see just snugly enough over the edges of the person that Is.

I do love you all, big picture considered. Take it as feedback or tolerate as catharsis.
I am not blameless myself.

...A monumental waste, and almost unholy. Sinister. Seeing the ways this environment is used to justify being ruled by ego instead of seeking dominion over mind, emotions, action. If you're going to play puppets, why aim so low? You (to an extent, with caveats) can be anyone you want to be online, you can believe anyone is anyone. And these are the illusions you choose to entertain? To elevate?
It's not such a horrid spectacle for everyone. Some I can see are well-intentioned, if not a bit naive, forgetful. Easily exploited, even. It does occasionally go from the top down.

I personally see the odds slim to none that change is educible from this post alone. From this sentiment, even. I can and should evolve it, repackage. For my own sake and sanity if nothing else.
Improvement, change at all, is.. uncertain, with a considerable few posters seeing this place as casual and inconsequential, incapable of being more even if those posters themselves also partly entertain the potential for above and beyond.
I argue not solely for this specific space, /mbti/, but for remote, online, human interpersonal relations. Self-actualization, potency through distillation.

I intend to speak when I can speak freely. I have undertaken great efforts recently to better identify the difference between being able to express myself freely, versus ensuring and/or avoiding certain perceptions. Those pesky narratives!)
No one can give or take away my ability to speak freely, but they can make the experience such a nuisance that I'm less inclined to attempt. I never want to be preachy. I fiercely value the autonomy of all individuals. Doesn't mean I don't cast judgements or take action to keep the expressed autonomy of others from threatening my own.

Some of the paramount issues seem the most unworkable, the patterns long since etched: here, on r9k, in society. At that point, I start to wonder whether it's worth it to save a sinking species or if you're just supposed to find the good ones and keep the dinghy afloat from there. It becomes a problem when spiky sabotage from the inside occurs. And still, you'll never escape the guilt. You were the one in charge of determining "good ones" and now everyone's soggy, and you're "making it worse" because they'd rather feel something than be soggy, so they relish the prick, but they only have to feel that way because they're waterlogged in the first place. It could be shanties and starlight, but it's complaints and dissension all around. Mutiny, they swear they're happy, good swimmers if worst comes to worst, and they toss you overboard. You're now so at peace with the unfactorable fathoms of chaos churning below you, relieved to be tossed to chance, worn down from seeing it all so clearly and not being able to keep

Sophie, INTJfemboi, and Homuanon probably receive the worst of it. Sophie is decently attractive and likable, but people memed him into being some kind of Chad when he's an insecure and depressed introvert. Nobody engages with INTJfemboi on any kind of meaningful level beyond spamming about how feminine he allegedly is. Homuanon has some who sincerely appreciate him but he's also in danger of being replaced with a flanderized, glamorized cardboard cutout by the userbase.

Elaborate on what you mean by the 
>and think you are 
part, however?

I know I can always find the best case scenario for myself. It's the encroaching necessity of sacrifice (thankless, fine. Enabling? No can do), the unfortunate compromise that keeps me stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to have to scrap everyone and everything up to this point just because the rot crept in.

I don't want to have be alone to be "safe" or "successful".
I am tired of having my compassion hypocritically weaponized against me to allow additional parties to take advantage of me beyond the initial offender. Open door, pile on in now until crowd-panic-crushed bodies become the best doorstops you've ever seen!
I am tired of being at the mercy of mortals masquerading as forces of nature. I navigate walls of water while they whine that I'm not doing enough, or doing it wrong.
This is branching off a bit to a larger area of personal struggle as of late, so I'll reign it in. Though it is all connected.

How do you walk the line between self-righteousness and doing what you know is your duty, Anonzzle?
If one has any personal stake in the Highest Good, they're up for major opposition, misinterpretation. But everyone has stake in the Highest Good, don't they? With all the posturing and plank-walking, how do you come across clearly, give the others a crow's-nest-view? We're all in it together, like it or not, so we should act accordingly --on dinghy or planetary scale. We're all saying this in different ways, doing it best as we're capable. But...

I don't know. I've lost momentum.

If I'm not misinformed, on principle I love the idea.

I just get lost in the momentary, "But m-muh time management, wait for me..." That's black-and-white thinking, but I have to be realistic, real with myself.
IE In childhood, had to run my hand in an unbroken line down the bannister from the top of the steps to the bottom. I would walk back to the top and start over if this was not accomplished. My aunt and mother tried to fix me by sometimes shoving my hand off and not letting me restart. I think it made me worse, more determined.
IE Stopped playing a game because during a busy week, my guild kicked me out for not being active "enough", though I was still active. I was..maybe..hurt, is the right word. Then I shamed myself for feeling hurt. "Get over it. Aww, you're dealing with trauma? You're dealing with crisis? And your little buddies aren't aware, so they kicked you? And they said you could come back if you're more active, but you feel sOooOo alone and conflicted by the weight of your pain and your own invalidation of it so who cares? Suck it up, there're more pressing matters at hand." With the competitive "log in EVERY day if you want to stay on the leaderboards" pace to things, I knew I would never get where I could if I hadn't had a gap in my playtime, so I gave up on it. (I've checked back in since, and I can enjoy it casually as a time-killer, but it's not so much my choice. It can only ever be that to me now.)
IE I have trouble keeping in contact with people, acquaintances and loved ones, because right place right time right way DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN

If I'm one of those people (and, to be honest, I can't think of anyone else who's as difficult as I am - most of the other regs are either detached Thinkers or Feelers who are much more composed than I am), feel free to say whatever you want whenever you want., in however much uncensored detail you want.

That picture is definitely me.

And if you're thinking of how you act when you have to talk to others in real life, I think that's just you not being reckless. It complicates things cause then it makes someone ask questions like what's bravery and recklessness and what are their differences. Regardless, I really do believe you're superior in this regard.

That is interesting. I have experienced the same differences in perspective they describe between scholars and practitioners in my own efforts to grasp the issue. This part made me think:
>Thus the process of intuiting, described as 'sensing + sensemaking', produces 'sensations with meaning', that is, intuition. While not all 'sensation with meaning' is intuition, all intuition is 'sensation with meaning'.
That is one good way to describe it, I have described it similarly before. I feel, however, this only displaces the ambiguity from "intuition" to "sense-making," as it is not clear what the latter consists in (what exactly distinguishes sense from non-sense), or how it can occur wordlessly. But I think you get to something interesting in your next posts as well, and in the discussion about dreams:
>This also explains why intuiting is tightly linked with domain expertise
>it's consequence of intuition immediately working with what integrates into what's understood
It seems the unconscious and conscious minds work closely together, not fully independently, but the core of the issue is that they speak two different languages; the latter usually in words, the former often in images, symbols, and I believe other means too primordial to be described. But I will stop there, unless you have thoughts. And those are good resources, thank you!

The "casual" part could benefit from expansion, as could much else. It will. I have to start somewhere. I'm balancing my investments and spinning my plates. 

Focus should be posters using the perceived quality and/or state of the place to excuse mediocrity and detriment backed by inarguable fact-of-the-matter. It's not fact. It's perspective; anything that isn't, is workable. "I don't care about working on it" is often argued equivalent to "It's unworkable." I dislike that.

>faggy faggots
It's not always one-sided, that much is evident. I can't blame them, I don't loathe anyone for long, not truly at all. Nonetheless, my choices are between stomaching it, affecting it, and distancing myself from it. I want utopia, not cope.

Then proceed to break into a market area looking for a KFC only to end up in a small warzone where people were mortaring and shooting each other which I participated in by using a Maxim Gun.

Most people aren't afraid of the state of being dead, though, they're scared of the painful or horrific ways they may lose their life. As Ram Dass says, "Death is safe." But dying can be the worst experience a person ever has, and as the mind conceptualizes of the fact that something so awful will be their last experience ever, it can be hard to accept. I do believe being blunt with ourselves about the reality of death leads to better lives (if we can use the awareness as fuel instead of buckling under it), but I don't know that it can ensure a calm, peaceful, painless passing.
Believing that 
>death is nothing to worry about 
and that 
>dying is nothing to worry about 
are two different things.

What do you think about that whole "Your brain releases massive amounts of DMT when you die so you may experience a psychedelic temporary infinity in the moment of your death" thing? Like, some people say right now we're in that allmoment as our "real" somewhere-else-body is fading. And if it has any validity, the phenomenon could be used to explain and even argue religion or spiritual practices. I.e. if you placebo yourself into being good all your life and believing you'll get into Heaven, your allmoment will be heaven, if you placebo yourself into guilt and thinking you may go to Hell for not being good enough, your allmoment will be hell, etc.

Do you think a good life is essential to a good death? Do you think there's any reason to work towards achieving any certain emotional or mental state at the time of death, and do you believe the "quality" of your death (for lack of a better and equally brief expression) has ramifications in the afterlife if one exists?

If anyone wants, I open the DMT/near-death/afterlife questions to all. I know the thread has talked plenty about woowoo life and death stuff, but I'd really like to hear everyone's perspectives on that aspect specifically, theories about allmomentmaxxing. These topics intrigue me, so new frontier or refresher, I always like when the conversation revolves around the esoteric, sacred, unknown, and where it meets science, assumed.
I think for the sake of this discussion it's best to treat the DMT release --or the exact nature of it-- as hypothetical. If anyone wants to debOOnk or clarify, it'd be appreciated, I just think it's still possible to get some good out of the topic without worrying about that area just yet.

>>72983694
Sorry I haven't picked back up on our last exchange. My method lately is just to kind of throw myself into things, be it in the thread or more private/personal spaces. It's to try to combat the tendency to self-isolate and spiral further into a place that makes it hard literally to verbalize myself at all, not just in the right way, we in the trenches of it as of late, I open my mouth and nothing comes out, not even schizobabble, it bad.

>And if it has any validity, the phenomenon could be used to explain and even argue religion or spiritual practices.
If I may interject with a commonly overlooked clarification for a moment - NDEs are unrelated to actual state of death to attribute states of "afterlife" to them, for, in the former, it can be summarized as "brain glitching* around in its over-reaction to potentially irreversible damages," which is not a "lack of any neuronal activity whatsoever."
Otherwise, getting anesthesia would always reliably give NDE experiences - it doesn't, typically patients just blip through until they're awake, unless something goes wrong.

*and said "glitches" give rise to archetypal representations and other memories based on what's in the head of the person specifically (cultural/religious imprints of locality, memories, etc)

>>72984129

you can live in a way that you have no regrets when you die, but death is just death.
>is there a reason to achieve a chosen mental state before death

>does the quality of your death have ramifications on the afterlife
i'm not religious, i have a sort of spiritual awareness that most dont. it's nothing fictional, it's just that most everything carries a literal energy and it has power.
our consciousness is held in our brains. without it, our being cannot be expressed the same way ever again. there is no afterlife. but since energy cannot be created or destroyed, when you die, you will be recycled, and embody new life, and become new things. when i die, say i drown, i'll be eaten by fish. the fish will lay eggs. my energy was transferred. in that way, reincarnation does exist. there is no 'you' beyond, though.

Worth of rest may be a topic, and there may be a conclusive truth. Is that useful right now? We do not have to keep every truth at the forefront. Some would accuse burying, but priority sets structure. Structure, if it is the accusation, is not worth fighting. 
You should rest. You are going to rest.

I got the wrong idea then. Seems to be happening with things here more often lately.
My logic basically went like if this person has to constantly face their fears then it means they are likely to be more brave than the average person (bravery isn't inherently fearlessness rather more commonly it's withstanding fear) but as I think about it now I don't think I can assume nearly that much from just the little I know when it's a person like you. Sorry, I'll think over the rash judgements next time
--- 72984561
>>72984505
i'm not brave in the way people portray it in stories. i'm just determined to do things that i feel like must be done. that's probably pragmatism more than anything.

in defense of your assumption, i don't think i've had many opportunities to be brave. attempting self improvement is necessary, and i go diving because it's fun. bravery would be to do something terrifying even though i didn't have to, and i didn't want to. like trying to fight off a mugger, when they were mugging someone other than myself. that's unnecessary and undesired, but scary; doing it would be brave. i can only think of one time i had an opportunity to do something brave, and i did not do it. that's why i say i'm a coward.

Ooh I didn't think about it that way. Now things make way more sense and I agree with your view completely. We're both cowards and I'll give the title of brave to someone else (I really don't know who)

Over analysis, having to weigh things that can be taken care of by those we trust, if we do, to know what's best for us.
Our tism is vulnerable to a lack of periphery, getting lost. If it's not time to drill at details, Je must be trusted so we can step back to focus fire of our lasers.
>What happens when you relinquish to something other than structure?
I'm not sure, what I think or what you mean. Maybe I do.
I suppose it's the same. Relinquishing to control that isn't in line with Ji is relinquishing to chaos, or whatever the opposite polarity would be. Idk, my head is tired

Just the way they use their feeling function.
With secondary Feeling you can tell that while they're good at Introverted Feeling or Extraverted Feeling that it's something that they have to expend effort on.
Meanwhile Dominant Feelers it's just purely a natural and raw thing that they don't even have to try for.
It's like the difference between being very skilled and being a genius.

As an aside, Ni doms often have a strong coping tendency stemming from strong interpretive capabilities.

It's a bit abstruse, a review of The Logic of Sense by Deleuze, partially in relation to what patchy anon posted earlier. Synopsis; sense gives words meaning, but it is not contained within words, rather it is their structure. But sense must be built out of non-sense, or combinations of nonsensical elements. Thus, sense is only a surface-texture for unknown depths, and fully-formed words have a genealogy in the unconscious in the same way that fully-formed organisms have a genealogy in the embryo and egg.
>we talk about a lot lol. its house of leaves right? sorry i just want to make sure we dont miscommunicate.
Oh, I've had that on my list since you mentioned it. I've also been reading The Red Book (Jung) and The Dandelion and The Orchid (about sensitivity), which I didn't mention before.
>im glad you liked it! do you remember roughly your path?
I didn't pick one yet, I only read through the options, I will think about that. 
And for the one here, I have a hard time picking between goth, preppy and neko. I like goth abilities the most. What did you pick?

Which trauma responses come most naturally to which types?

What are some of the ways types might look in a rest &amp; digest (parasympathetic nervous system activation as opposed to the sympathetic nervous system activation seen in fight flight etc.) phase? 
Alternatively, how would you advise each of the types to best take care of themselves and recover when in the rest &amp; digest phase?

(PS to picrel: "Flop/Faint", "Friend", and "Fright" are some additional terms I have heard. Rather than being entirely new models, they all seem concerned with specifying certain behaviors that can already be found within the commonly known/accepted main 4. I have also seen "Fatigue" which seems to be just another way to refer to the rest &amp; digest response that comes after the traumatized individual no longer has to rely on the initial responses for survival.)
--- 72994386
>>72994324
I think I like this version of that information better. Eyes want to wander from the first, dense. This has movement and composition that aids focus naturally.

I think these images specifically are interesting because Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Fawn are being viewed and presented truly as personality types that people embody after complex trauma. It is not supposed to be just an explanation of the standard trauma responses.

nice.
the i havet moved on past the first part of the red book. i dont think jung is a very good writer. its like he is trying to be academic and formal but cant. its not so bad in the red book but still there enough i have to be in a very specific mood to read it. ive heard of the dandelion and the orchid. i dont like reading "physiology" books. i feel they are at best pointless and at worst a meme.

Y'know, when you think about it, differential psychology tests are just CYOAs of less artistic value - the compiled* multi-layer results are based on your answers to setting-specific** questions, and the choices are shaped by the general category of your personal preferences***, either way.
My CYOA answers? I caught myself on trying to seek efficiency within fictional scenarios intended for relaxation and got too upset to continue.

>Which trauma responses come most naturally to which types?
I think it would be more fitting to use enneagram typology here. Surface descriptions and even stereotypes over the enneatypes fit right in for distribution between those four - an unconventionally handy starting point.
>>72994324
>Alternatively, how would you advise each of the types to best take care of themselves and recover when in the rest &amp; digest phase?
Maybe what'd help on a more fundamental way is to address the very reason for the need for recovery in the first place?
What I mean is that there could be some sense to peek into the direction of consideration that, perhaps, the "point" of these processes (and their minor forms) is not to see them as something that just has to overtake the mind - rather, it'd be something for the person to make peace with, on the basis that it's there to offer suggestions and assistance for the willfully intended conscious activity - as long as there's openness to interpretation and acknowledgement.

for the niggers who keep tabs on my bizarre medical abnormalities, the sympathetic nervous system is a major component of why my brain goes haywire. it's controlled by neurotransmitters; SNS controls activating hormonal, emotional, and biological responses. a functioning SNS activates ABC when 123 conditions are met, but not when 456 conditions are met, that activates DEF. my SNS activates A-Z for any parameter at all. my PSNS doesn't know when to call it quits.

>And for the one here, I have a hard time picking between goth, preppy and neko. I like goth abilities the most. What did you pick?
you can have all three! why do you like those?
for me its comfy, formal, and naked. because i either dress comfortably, for the occasion, or not at all. 
>comfy
comfy cloths are one of the Great Sensations and if you arnt indulging youre missing out on one of the main things this place as to offer. i want to be youthful forever. i dont want to die slowly. i dont want to forget. also making all my cloths comfy also pairs well with my second choice...
>formal
i love the look of formal cloths but hate shopping and paying and wearing them. having all those problems solved would make them my second choice easy. i also love the security of the pretty fucking fair sized passive income. now combine all that. a secure passive income, fashionable formalwear, and a big boost to my already high insight, and you get "Jackie Coatrack P.I; the obscure detective". i live in the back of my 90s crown vic that i park in the driveway of the fair queen; meet all my clients in american owned gas stations (or the waffle house if they pay big), and always always always wear an ocher trench coat 2 sizes 2 big. why? well im not wearing anything under this and ocher brings out the blue in my eyes.
>naked
is fun to say. it is also really comfortable. my big thing is i hate wearing shoes but lots of places hate me not wearing shoes. same with shirts but to a lesser extent. its not like im an exhibitionist or anything, really im shy, i just like the feeling of grass on my soul and the breeze on my skin. the flawless skin is a nice little perk but really im just picking this because i hate shoes. and what really get to me is that you see these 12 year old girls walking around in their damned underwear and nobody says a word, but me and my grown ass self absofuckinglutly MUST wear shoes in this establishment. its so damn backwards i could go on for hours.

That part is a bit more complicated, but his view is that the world is an egg. I have an inkling of what he means (and there are mythological antecedents), but I am afraid I would mangle it by trying to explain at this time. 
>the i havet moved on past the first part of the red book. i dont think jung is a very good writer
Yeah, and it would surely be the most difficult in this regard due to its context and subject matter.

Also, you made me think of something else that has been on my mind, which is that I have always felt that I don't "read books" so much as an activity, I am only interested in what they meant to the writer, and to me. 
I think the same is true of many mediums of expression, such as film, video games, or others. For example, when a filmmaker is truly passionate about their work, they aren't simply "making a film," they are using film for their own purposes, to express themselves. And the final product is not simply a film, but a crystallized expression of the human spirit, which is timeless.

I think this is why the more that something is made in a calculated manner, the more easily it will be surpassed in time, as better calculations and refinements will always be made, but what the creation meant to its creator is timeless, and will always hold up well, or may even get better upon revisiting.

Deleuze's conceptual networking related to his scope of "sense" seems to be more easily understandable (that is, the following "handy" "swaps" seem to fit in terms of "originals' " attributed meanings and the reasoning based on them, including the extrapolations and additional descriptions, within which the specialist philosophers can stumble, evidently including Deleuze et al.) within settings of academic literature if you consider that:
>"designation" is concrete objectivity
>"manifestation" is abstract subjectivity
>"signification" is reasoning in relation to truth (truth is, in itself, also universally handy to view as "state of congruence with existence")
>"expression"/"sense" as abstract objectivity
>"non-sense" as concrete subjectivity (alternatively - qualia), other propositions on the same level of closeness to truth, noise ("if it were only to find between sense and nonsense a relation analogous to that of the true and the false?" (Deleuze 1990: 68) - why, conceptual notion of "state of congruence with existence" seems to fit here. Noise is unrelated to matters of congruence with existence, sense of gibberish is just not congruent with existence for as far as "signification" can assess it, etc)
>" 'minor'/'intensive' use of language that is beyond the literal and the metaphorical" - attempts to convey concrete subjectivity into realm of objectivity/comprehension 1:1 ("when sense is actively neutralized . . . when there remains only enough of sense to direct the lines of escape . . . in order to liberate a living and expressive material that speaks for itself and has no need of being put into a form." (Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 21) )
or something along these lines.

Of course, it's better for the reader to check for themself if that's actually "handy and correct." I'd love to see if I've missed something.

I'm the same exact way. I'm pretty damn conflict avoidance personally. It's a fucking curse, but I've also been complimented for my ability to soothe stressful situations (like stopping people from arguing). Do you tend to argue with people in your head though?

Punk is tempting because of things I wanna do to jews in minecraft

I wish we could stop calling this stuff mbti and call it Jungian typology instead. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator itself is genuinely pseudo-scientific because the test is unreliable.

>the difference between the two modes of thinking becomes still more obvious when the subjectively orientated thinking makes an attempt to bring objective data into connections not objectively given, i.e. to subordinate them to a subjective idea. Either senses the other as an encroachment, and hence a sort of shadow effect is produced, wherein either type reveals to the other its least favourable aspect, The subjectively orientated thinking then appears quite arbitrary, while the extraverted thinking seems to have an incommensurability that is altogether dull and banal. Thus the two standpoints are incessantly at war.
>in themselves both orientations are one-sided, with a definitely restricted validity; hence they both require this mutual correction. Thought is at once sterilized, whenever thinking is brought, to any great extent, under the influence of objective data, since it becomes degraded into a mere appendage of objective facts; in which case, it is no longer able to free itself from objective data for the purpose of establishing an abstract idea. The process of thought is reduced to mere 'reflection', not in the sense of 'meditation', but in the sense of a mere imitation that makes no essential affirmation beyond what was already visibly and immediately present in the objective data. Such a thinking-process leads naturally and directly back to the objective fact, but never beyond it ; not once, therefore, can it lead to the coupling of experience with an objective idea. And, vice versa, when this thinking has an objective idea for its object, it is quite unable to grasp the practical individual experience, but persists in a more or less tautological position. The materialistic mentality presents a magnificent example of this.

They're different; neither is better or worse! ^.^
However! I was going to write about the functions as tools for reaching spiritual enlightenment!

And people who have Se in their main stack also have Ni there, but then I remembered people with high Se actually also tend to have high Ne (and vice versa), so... @w@

Shorts are the comfier the shorter they are especially in hot weather! They're also more practical than skirts and dresses! Short shorts in particular are kyoot and femmy - but not modest or practical enough for some contexts! :3

Skirts and dresses are the cutest and the most feminine in my opinion! They can be comfy when it's warm or hot! However, they're also the least practical and potentially the least modest (though you can wear shorts or pants underneath, but that takes points off of comfiness)! ^w^;;;

Thank you, that was fun to think about, paraphrasing is a good way to understand things. Most of that looks good, the only part where I think some meaning could get lost:
>"non-sense" as concrete subjectivity (alternatively - qualia)
I believe with qualia, experiences still have sense. "Blue," for example, expresses something, even if it purely qualitative and irreducible.
In the state of non-sense, blue would no longer be a discrete experience of the world. It is not it that it goes from abstract to concrete, but that it is no longer something that pre-exists the body at all, it is rather produced here, by you, in this moment. Thus it can be felt as a pure bodily intensity, out of which any new sense can be made, like the creation of a different world. I think this is the meaning of becoming "every name in history" as well. At least, I have a vague grasp of what he means, but I am not sure I have put it into words properly. I might've said more but I wanted to get back to you sooner rather than later.

INFJ
No, ESP might be real but it's a separate thing
Dom Ni users are either some of the very best or the very worst. Two years ago I talked to an INFJ girl online that had an effect on me that almost nobody else has ever had. But I have known some uniquely terrible Ni Doms, namely an INFJ guy I met on r9k in 2017.
>in what ways do you defy Ni stereotypes?
I don't know if I have 'aha' moments more frequently than anyone else (they seem fairly common for people in general), and I don't know about the "Ni Doms can never explain their opinions" thing. While that applies to me sometimes, it mainly only factors in when the topic is complex and has a large scope - the majority of the time I do know why I feel the way I do about a topic. 

Not to mention that reverse engineering is a thing. Do I know why I hold every opinion that I do? No, I don't. I have some ideas for what my dad was like in the 1950s and 1960s or what my grandparents were like in the 1930s, but I didn't logic them out, they were just kind of there. I have some thoughts about what most people I know are like under the surface or how they would feel about certain things (with decent accuracy but I'm sure there'd be plenty of surprises and wrong guesses), about the nuances and subtleties of certain time periods, but again I didn't logic them out really. Still, I could take most of those overall conclusions and voluntarily think about actual logical arguments supporting them.

I do typically avoid arguments if I have nothing to go on but intuition though. Like if someone links to a study saying that x expert says y technology will never work, and I believe in that technology and disagree with the author's premise, I don't really give a shit about what the expert has to say - I believe that the future will play out like I think it will and that's that, but since "idk it's just a feeling I get" isn't a convincing argument I'd probably just lurk and not say anything.

You'll certainly find it interesting when you'll read it later, then!
>The alternative to experiential avoidance is acceptance: adoption of an intentionally open, receptive, and flexible posture with respect to moment-to-moment experience. Acceptance is not passive tolerance or resignation but an intentional behavior that alters the function of inner experiences from events to be avoided to a focus of interest, curiosity, and observation as part of living a valued life. Ironically, acceptance is one of the biggest functional changes possible, and often will ultimately change the form of emotional events themselves.
--- 73007370
>I'd say for most people, naturally flowing conversations are a bit like a game of ADD-riddled ping pong where they bounce from topic to topic through loose connections. That is, until you hit a topic that some people in the group actually want to explore in-depth...you gotta keep fishing for it until you find some common ground that you're all passionate or interested about.
>It's similar to those word association games/psychological assessments where you form connections between words. One topic loosely leads to another, which triggers one person to re-tell a related (or even tangential) story, which triggers another person to ask questions, and so on

>Breadth of conversation with someone you don't know intimately, is far more important than depth of conversation. Similar to how saying the perfect response or joke to something has no value if the timing window has already passed (there's a far better payoff at saying something mediocre at the RIGHT time, than saying the perfect thing when it's already too late)
>Smalltalk leading to deeper topics is similar to fucking - you can't just start jackhammering away at a person, you need to ease them into it with some foreplay first.
>Also it sounds like you and these people are young and not all that mature yet, which is why (1) they don't have that much profound things to say yet, and (2) they are not able to communicate clearly about the plans either just being wishful thinking, or not meant to include you,


>Either find like-minded people who prefer depth of topics over breadth, or adapt to it. Nerdy people and autists tend to want to dive right into depth because either they lack the social skills to ease into it (nerds) or just have hyper-specific interests and can't relate to anything else (autists).

--- 73007398
>>73006667
I don't know if I have any strong values, if I do have strong values they're usually related to sensory stuff like liking warm weather instead of cold weather or liking this object instead of the other object which, if I understand the functions correctly, might be more of an Si or Se thing
I still don't really get how Fi and Ti manifest in every day thinking and reasoning but I often don't have a good understanding of why I feel certain emotions and try to reason with myself about it but usually to no avail but I am not sure if that's actually indicative of higher or lower Fi or not related to functions at all

It's typically useful to figure out the type by looking at the most inferior function but lmao what the hell Ni and Se are both that low?

>>73007687
Could be. That'd be one of the reasons as for why tests may be unreliable.
For starters, do descriptions from here for extraverted intuitives or introverted thinkers ring a bell?

I don't really relate to the whole 'knowing things intuitively without words' thing (I'm a very verbal person) and I'm not much of a risk taker in my day to day. Maybe that's it? I could kinda guess what function each question was trying to get at and a lot of the Ni questions were borderline psychic shit I don't get it. I'm also not spiritual at all.

I feel the same way. Of course, the point is that by staying dressed up at home, you are allowing the outside in, but I don't think I would like that at all. I think that might appeal more to extroverts. I love layering for cold weather, but I don't get enough of it where I am currently.

calculation has nothing to do with making things age poorly. Its lack of effort. lack of soul. i know thats a meme but there is truth in it. the suburbs will all vanish; the skyscrapers will not. intent and care makes things last, and calculation is a big way that intent and care are shown.

i think the red book is easier than physiological types or synchronicity or Aion. im sure some stuff is still lost in translation but because of the esoteric and personal nature of the red book he seems less concerned with being "credible" and so writes in a more natural style i can understand better. 
>Also, you made me think of something else that has been on my mind, which is that I have always felt that I don't "read books" so much as an activity, I am only interested in what they meant to the writer, and to me.
I think the same is true of many mediums of expression, such as film, video games, or others. For example, when a filmmaker is truly passionate about their work, they aren't simply "making a film," they are using film for their own purposes, to express themselves. And the final product is not simply a film, but a crystallized expression of the human spirit, which is timeless.

Fuck, stole my question, but I should have made it a more general question anyway. I consneed this time. Besides, I may was well answer my own question
>>your type
INFP
>>have you ever lost a passion that you once had?
Absolutely. Multiple times sadly
>>What was that passion?
The first that comes to mind are drawing and writing. The reason I even wanted to ask the question in the thread here was because I just realized that my passion for coming up with stories is all but gone. I have tried for years and years, since middle school, captured in my inner world coming up with all kinds of shit. So much shit was silly or cringe, some of it may have been nice or even profound in some way. But alas, the well has long since dried out and I now realize that there's no point in trying to force any creativity out of myself. For far too long trying to come up with anything at all has felt like squeezing a long since dried out rag for moisture. Not only do I never come up with anything good, but I now realize that it's not even really fun to try. It always ends in me feeling kinda low because I so desperately want to express myself somehow, but this just won't make my soul blossom. My soul can no longer express itself this way.
>>How long did it take to dissipate?
I've been rehashing the same characters and story ideas for years now. I probably haven't come up with more than maybe one new and interesting story pitch since I graduated in 2018. The whole ordeal is like spinning tires in mud until I've gone deeper than a Verdun trench. Letting go of an old passion sucks, but I just don't think I'm gonna get out of that trench with my current mental vehicle. Maybe in a few years I'll suddenly get some inspiration again. 
>>When did you know the joy from it was gone?

As for your questions:
>>your type
INFJ-T!!! ^_^'
>>have you ever lost a passion that you once had?
Y-yeah, but it has always come back or I keep getting thoughts related to it... I feel I can never get rid of it completely! TwT
>>What was that passion?
I had many! Drawing, writing, videogame design, and song/music-making were maybe in the top 4! *^.^*;;;
>>How long did it take to dissipate?
Until my adult years! (Though I still hold on to the belief that maybe someday there's an incredible stroke of luck and I get to design a small educational game or something, but I wouldn't count on such miracles...) :'3cc
>>When did you know the joy from it was gone?
When I realized I'm not good (and lucky) enough! Sure, I'm pretty talented and skilled, but just a notch or two short of what it takes to create something that isn't slightly better than mediocre, especially during an age where arts and entertainment are somewhat oversaturated! :(

Great! I'd love to hear if you have any thoughts. And I will get back to you after I've thought on it some more.
>i think the red book is easier than physiological types or synchronicity or Aion. im sure some stuff is still lost in translation but because of the esoteric and personal nature of the red book he seems less concerned with being "credible" and so writes in a more natural style i can understand better.
I can see that, The Red Book appears mostly to be written as first-person accounts and prose, although it seems to contain in these the esoteric seeds of his other works. Whereas Aion has detailed analyses of many esoteric traditions like alchemy and astrology, which can seem incomprehensible, although I believe I have finally gained a better understanding of some of those recently.

How to patience and calmmaxx? 
>>73008394
I dont think so
once, I answered talking about music
but I havent truly lost my passion for it
I cant fatom (phantom? phatom? no I think fatom is the right word r-right) truly losing my love and interest for something, in that sense
It appears an innate phenomenon
of course, whatever it is, isnt *truly* innate to one, as one is greatly shaped by environmental influences
Nature and nurture are greatly intertwined however
Anyways, I would attribute my perceived loss of infatuation to it more to by general loss of infatuation towards everything, rather than singling it out compared to other things
Usually, I am really interested in many things, and if I stop being so, I am disinterested in most things too 
So if I enjoy a simple forest walk, I will enjoy music, interactions with others, looking at a map and manipulating numbers
Certainly, I feel unable to single out a so called passion I ever lost interest in

>>73020764
Extraverts usually have a blind spot for ideas and things close to themselves. All of the extraverted cognitive functions are outwards-looking compared to their introverted counterparts, like how Fe is focused moreso on other while Fi is focused on oneself.

>>73020897
Probably a type with developed Se. INTPs tend to be bottoms, so someone else should take the lead instead.

--- 73021118

The ones I have seen tend to be not what I would call sexy, but more friendly and open. Still attractive.

ENTJs and ESTPs more often go for more of the sexy look because they dress in sharper styles overall.

I don't think clothing style has any relation to type. But what is your definition of sexy?
--- 73021429
>>73021228
>But what is your definition of sexy?
In frank terms, a look that gives off an instant, strong "breed-me-now" impression.

In contrast, someone with a girl/guy-next-door look has more of a "marriage material" vibe, despite potentially possessing even more attractive features.

>I don't think clothing style has any relation to type
Changing the clothes, hairstyle, and grooming of a person can drastically transform their vibe.

I personally think that people of the same type tend to express themselves in similar ways due to thinking similarly.
--- 73021550
>>73021429
What I meant to say is that you can have specific clothing that you think is sexy, but it varies between people. Some men think jeans are sexy, while others prefer skimpy dresses or shorts. What is your definition of a breed-me-now look?

> I personally think that people of the same type tend to express themselves in similar ways due to thinking similarly.
But I think clothing is still very personal and can be wildly different depending on the person, even if it's the same time. No such thing as an ENFJ clothing style is what I mean.

> Tupac
> Harry Styles
> Damon Albarn
> Mike Shinoda

All of the above are ENFJ musicians. All of them have different styles, both in music and personal image. Their personalities may be the same, but they still have very different ways to express themselves.
--- 73021691
>>73021550
>All of the above are ENFJ musicians. All of them have different styles, both in music and personal image. Their personalities may be the same, but they still have very different ways to express themselves.
They're celebs tho, celebs tend to force and build themselves around an ingenuine image that's supposed to help them stand out the best
--- 73021754
>>73021550
I don't know these musicians well enough to make a judgment, but I don't believe in consensus typings from sites like Personality Database. Most people vote for superficial reasons and it shows in the comments.

>What I meant to say is that you can have specific clothing that you think is sexy, but it varies between people.
I think it's a holistic thing that cannot be reduced to specifics such as skimpy dresses or shorts.

I am talking about overall impressions that don't have to be expressed with specific clothing items.
--- 73021783
What's interaction like between Se and Si tertiary anyway?
--- 73021859
>>73021691
Yeah, you're right. I doubt that every single piece of clothing is chosen by their PR manager, though. I'd believe that it's the case for concerts and events, but not for everyday life. I wanted to say with that list is that you can look up different ENFJ and they wouldn't be exact clones of the same person.

>>73021754
>Most people vote for superficial reasons and it shows in the comments.
I agree!

> I am talking about overall impressions that don't have to be expressed with specific clothing items.
I was asking about clothing items because of what you said here:

>ENTJs and ESTPs more often go for more of the sexy look because they dress in sharper styles overall.
--- 73021941
>>73021859
holy shit, enfj-senpai finally posted a selfie of herself. very cute.
--- 73022071
>>73021859
>I was asking about clothing items because of what you said here
I phrased it inaccurately. Makeup, hairstyle, accessories, and natural features are important too.

But basically, I type people based off of tells in their behavior and expression. If I type them right, I find they express all the other tells of their type and few of the ones of other types.

I don't use someone's appearance as a tell because it does not rule anything out, but there is definitely a trend.

More like the sensor just accepts his/her own personal experience as the one true reality and never bothers to question it. Not saying most intuitive are better but at least they sometimes try to separate their internal biases from incoming information to get a glimpse of something closer to actual reality.
--- 73022479
>>73022388
I have no idea about political party preference, but Se/Ni users tend to have more progressive beliefs, and Si/Ne users tend to have more conservative ones. The former group tends to have perspectives of the world, and will promote changes that fit with their vision. The latter group have things they want to avoid, keep, or reintroduce.

Can't say much about religious beliefs because it's not something I've looked into much.
--- 73022525
>>73022464

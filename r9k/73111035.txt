Does anyone know if sitewide rangebans are permenant? I recently got a new ISP and I can't post anywhere with it. I only have a few days left with my current one and I don't want to be fucked over by something like this.

They're not. The can sometimes last a week+ but they do expire. 

Also, consider buying a 4chan pass. If you do a lot of normal (non-banworthy) posting then it's a worthwhile investment.

Those soles make me feel things I don't want to contemplate. How are they so puffy?

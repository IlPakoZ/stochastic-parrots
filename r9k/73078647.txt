I have a feeling there are a good few auditors who simply don't have any positive attention in their lives. No one to love them. Auditing is cope.

Why don't zoomers like the monarchy?
--- 73078820
read this as babecock at first lmao
--- 73078837
The one thing I would never do is go live when depressed and on the booze. The pigs gather so much info from them doing live videos.
--- 73078901
>>73078761
Because you like fatties because they're less undesirable than other normal therefore matching the fact you're also undesirable and that you could have a better chance. That's why you like fatties
--- 73078987
The one thing I would never do is actually do anything I say I will when I can play make believe on 4chan
--- 73078988
>>73078901
Maybe he just likes soft jiggly lasses or something. The belly wobbling is peculiar behaviour though.
--- 73078995

So you've been saying for 8 months now lad 
>Saving up to buy a phone etc 
>Don't claim bennies so its taking a while 
>Will eventually have to claim bennies but that means leaving the house 
etc etc etc. 
We've heard is all before soft lad, you've repeated the drivel often enough.
--- 73079197
>>73079000
He keeps chatting up young ladies and they clearly don't like it. He can't understand what's wrong. He got really annoyed when she said she must get back to her bf. The poor lad is going through a mid-life crisis. Went to a naughty school and can't see his kids anymore. No wonder he feels so down. Amazing how some people can't see their own flaws. I'm hopeful things will get better for the Yorkshire lad.
--- 73079229
>>73079194
well when I'm ready, I'm ready. I need to do this. I'm never getting relationships. I may as well do my own thing.

All a bit thick up there aren't they?
--- 73079309
It's so sad to see 30+ men feel so down and drowning their sorrows at the pub. The whole thing with men aging better is a joke. Nobody wants to know you past 30. Don't drink alcohol lads. It only makes everything worse in the long run - both physically and mentally. Girls don't like unstable men. It does help to be attractive in life and keep yourself healthy. That's no guarantee you'll find love though.
--- 73079358
>>73079268
You're thinking of Lancashire.
--- 73079364
>>73079309
Do you mean don't become an alcoholic? 99% of adults in this country drink, some more than others. Work friend of mine put it quite well, we were discussing dry January and he described it as watching a porn but finding out that it's all dicks. Everyone needs some cope, imagine just rawdogging reality without any chemical buffer.
--- 73079368
>>73079358
You take that back you smug frog fuck!
--- 73079373
>>73079358
I'm thinking of everyone above the Watford gap. Especially Birmingham, genuinely can't believe anyone from their is even slightly competent or intelligent. Would rather deal with the Irish.
--- 73079380
>>73079268
Maybe but he seems like a bit of a player and is now paying the price. Messed around in his 20s, women got tired of his anger issues and I don't think he has a stable income/career. He's 37 now and can't understand why women don't want him. When I saw that woman walk away, he made a little derogatory comment about her just because she said her boyfriend is sitting over there. Lonely man but at least he isn't incel (he has past relationships and children).

My suggestion would be to shave that beard, dress a bit smarter (he's wearing trackies), get on some training for a new career and control his anger more. Watching AY's live is depressing.
--- 73079392
Guarantee he will delete the live video like he did with the last one when he revealed the face of another auditor.
--- 73079399
>>73079368
Fine, you're actually not that bad at all.
--- 73079406
>>73079392
What video lid
--- 73079414
We all like the young ladies but things are different now (younger people don't date older like they used to). AY will have to find someone his own age. I find he does chat up girls in their twenties and thinks he's 21 still.
--- 73079416
>>73079380
Watching any YouTube personality or streamer is depressing. It's reality TV for nerds that get to feel superior by not watching love Island, but if you look at it objectively it's the same dumb shit with no artistic merit or real entertainment value
--- 73079417
I reckon DJA is an incel
--- 73079422

I don't watch these people, need some catch up.

He found a police van and thought it was a good idea to open the door and act the big man on live stream. He doesn't like it now the police are asking him questions.
--- 73079478
>>73079456
you can rewind, I think he's getting into a fight. he's had too many drinks.

>>73079464
the bar lady said something about it but he said he was only filming himself. he kept trying to buy her a drink but she wasn't having any of it. making excuses that she's boring to hopefully make him give up.
--- 73079489
AY is kicking off big time
--- 73079493
kek the cops have got him now live. maybe don't give away you were in Halifax as a wanted man. real low iq.

>>73079478
>you can rewind
Yeah just did that. At least we still get audio
--- 73079508
Auditing Yorkshire just arrested for vehicle interference. Kek. And this is why the ladies don't like you. You are an unstable, angry, middle aged man.

Fuck I thought it was just another boring "poor me why don't the ladies like me anymore" drunken stream again but now he's going to be staring at a ceiling all night.

Join a members club, I may not give a shit about the politics but the FORMAT of conservative clubs is brilliant. I used to go to the Canterbury one a lot as a guest. Nice snooker tables.

You're allowed to film in public. Anywhere really as long as it isn't voyeurism or within a restricted area (prison, military base). It's all fair game filming hot girls in bikinis this summer.

I don't know man. Cute but could never trust being in a relationship with someone in the police. Let them date each other. Pigs are pigs at the end of the day. It attracts those with low iq.

--- 73080348
On the ceiling of the custody cell, they usually have a stencil thing that says you can sort your life out with the right help. I bet he's staring at that. Probably calmed down a bit now. You may take the piss but this is a troubled man who needs love and affection in his life.

When I got arrested they never gave me clothes, I just wore what I was wearing when taken in. I was out in about 8 hours but still. Just booked into the cell, then had my mugshot and fingerprints taken by some qt negress, back to the cell, interview and released without charge

>>73080408
Same process almost. They took the clothes as "evidence" for damaging something apparently. Told me to sign my fingerprints and detention...why the fuck would I do that? Seems pointless. So I refused. Could use your handwriting style against you in the future too.

--- 73080480
When I got arrested I was issued with mechanics overalls. This was bizarre because the crime I was alleged to have committed was criminal damage at a garage. The duty sergeant said it was so I could empathise with what the terrified mechanic had to deal with as I was smashing up his snap-on toolbox. Not sure that was really appropriate because you're meant to be innocent until proven guilty, and by trying to pre-emptively punish me they were presuming guilt.

When I got arrested it was on the morning of my 30th birthday. The lads who arrested me didn't say who they were but just being seen in that position messed up my job at the bank. I tried for ages to get in touch with the judge and officials for my case but they were all over the place, and people started spreading horrible rumours about me, and it took ages to find the right court room for my case. It ended up being in the attic, which was a bit weird. I tried to explain that I didn't know why I'd been arrested but that just seemed to rile them up more. My uncle tried to give me a hand but his lawyer wasn't very well, and said that I'd messed my case up. He was fucking useless to be fair. Anyway in the end they took me out to a quarry and stabbed me with a butcher's knife, like a dog.

These are the types of lads you're arguing with.
--- 73080645
>>73080596
I like to take my basket back to the thing after using the self checkout so they think I'm a nice lad. Sometimes they even say thank you and I say "no bother!"

There's no greater joy in my life than being a lovely lad whenever I can

--- 73080669
Sometimes at the self checkout I intentionally mess it up so the cute checkout lady leans over me and punches in the code to reset it. That's the only female attention I get.
--- 73080673
I had a dream that I was playing at the world snooker championships, and I was on course to potentially get a 147. Just before potting the final red I heard footsteps racing and it was poleaboo, who jumped onto the table, sent a few of the balls flying and shaked powder all over the table. 

This was my only chance to ever get a 147 and poleaboo had ruined it, I was furious, so furious in fact that I went up to him (stood on the table facing away from me), and used my snooker cue to 'pot' his bollocks. To be precise I aimed for the left one, and he flinched and screamed in agony. To make matters worse, the ref called it a push and awarded my opponent 4 points.
--- 73080688
There is such a nice feel when a girl's hair brushes against your skin for a brief moment. It makes me feel better. Smelling their perfume and hearing the bracelets dangle calms me down.
--- 73080698
>>73080669
The one at mine is typically is this old greasy looking long haired fart. There was a cute young girl one time I went, she was wearing stupidly tight jeans to further remind guys like me I don't stand a chance.
--- 73080704
One time I accidentally knocked a girl when I poked my head up from the fridge thing with the sandwiches. She didn't say anything even though I apologised. Because she ignored me I got real abusive and stormed out.
--- 73080718
>>73080698
Most of the time it's old ladies and big men. All the qts do restaurant and coffee shop work. Can't go to those places as that's not my style.
--- 73080725
Bet you're all slow and inefficient at the self checkout. Bet you're cackhanded and clumsy and fumble with your bags when there's a queue. Bet your card doesn't work properly the first time you try to use contactless so you have to put it in the machine instead, wasting valuable time. Bet you fuck up scanning an item and need to wait for a slow, listless man to come over and help you.
--- 73080728
>>73080688
I know the feeling, girls are pretty awesome. I enjoy relaxing with some ASMR but nothing beats being with them in person. Just thinking of this makes me feel better.
--- 73080731
There are men right now sitting in custody wanting to end it all. Grim to think about the mental health crisis.
--- 73080734
>>73080718
Good point. I've never been to a restaurant before. Have no idea how to order at one. Been to coffee shops before but that was years ago and it was those chain stores that are quick get in get out thing.

That's how I got rid of my pennies.
--- 73080787
Under what circumstances would you refuse a shag?
--- 73080795
I still have a few 1ps and 2ps left. Those never get accepted by the self-checkout. So I'm thinking of going to the Bank of England and exchanging them for new ones. Then I can spend the rest.
--- 73080800
>>73080771
All the ones at my local are card only now. Piss take.
--- 73080811
>>73080800
This was a while ago. Makes sense to speed things up now. Old people usually go to the checkouts anyway with cash.
--- 73080818
>>73080744
Yeah that's certainly been a spanner in the works. But it's still possible. I'm lucky I work in tech support and there's only a small-ish pool of staff so I get to go and help people in person quite a bit, and we have a fair few qts working for us.

It must suck to be extroverted, 37 and not feeling wanted anymore by girls. Men need to change their attitudes and start being a bit more respectful. I can tell women avoid him because he comes across as confrontational, too direct and wears trackies. Simply dressing up a bit smarter, shaving, ditching the cap and having platonic relationships can help build your mental health up. You shouldn't go in talking to some girl expecting them to be interested in you. You have to accept that in life. Speak calmly and be respectful to others. It would also help to quit drinking and smoking heavily. He's a very impulsive man. Soon as some girl mentions her boyfriend, it triggers him.

He refuses to change and lashes out on authority. This can't be the way. A girl isn't going to want a troublemaker and someone that gets aggressive in tone. I hope he's seriously thinking about his choices now in custody and makes a change.

Germany is sending massive amounts of weapons to Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. They say the money they send for aid while knowingly funding the Palestinian military.

Israel has collapsed and is entirely funded (unwillingly) by the US tax payer.

Simultaneously Germany is at war against Russia again and is arming the Ukrainian Nazis.

Russia has asked for diplomacy countless times and evidently wants the war to end.

All the so called immigrants Germany is taking in is vastly mostly girls from regions decimated by Israel. They are building an army.

Abood could tell you instantly which Middle Eastern airline has the most legroom in premium economy. He'd even buy you speedy boarding without a second thought due to his excellent income from making disfigured kids beautiful. 

Meanwhile, Ruthmong can't even get a passport because he has no power and agency in his life, trapped in a prison of his own making.

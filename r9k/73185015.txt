I genuinely don't understand. Aside from the fact they can't really change their sex anyway and beyond it being "cool" in their warped zoomer head why would any woman in their right mind want to be a man? Do they not understand how easy they have it? Do they fetishize gay men? Do they want normal men to stay the fuck away from them?

Tattoos and piercings just won't cut it anymore.

Not full on trans but I like boymodimg, it's rewarding and liberating to be able to see how the other side lives. Also in some ways it's easier being a guy.

Other people calling you a guy sometimes because they don't want to offend you doesn't mean you know how it is to be one

we need more murder mystery radio like from the 60s. too bad we can't really do things like that anymore due to the advancement of forensics

just dont be a retard and you wont get caught for quite a while. security cams arent all that good, they mostly are off for a good part of the time and they arent everywhere. if you can drive to a dirt road its gg

because he was clumsy, its extremely simple to remember to check their phones, if you cant, simply destroy it

Anyone else just drives around aimlessly on the weekend? I need to stop, it's really stupid. I just bought a brand new car too and it's really nice, I feel like I'm just putting a miles on it for no reason, I never go anywhere, or do anything, I just drive around Iistening to music.

rich NPCs don't really have any real hobbies except for having sex and spending money. maybe theres aren't any real hobbies and thats really the best thing to do. i wouldnt know.

>>73143929

he waits until i do something to start raping me. like if i start to feel bad that i have to be anorexic, he will begin to rape me and force me to stare at him making different facial expressions. he will do this until i'm screaming, sometimes he will do it for 8 hours, and i'll literally be screaming and crying for 8 hours. 

i dont know what i'm suppose to do, while i am being raped the only thing i can think about is how bad it hurts to be raped. the thought will just keep playing in my mind. 

he also gives me "advice" on things that i'm doing, but it is generally over insignificant details. its a torture method called gaslighting. he makes around 10,000+ comments like this to me per day.

>>73143975
most of it is gaslighting over health issues. i feel stupid for falling for it every time, but when i'm getting chest pain or stomach pain and god is screaming at me in this high pitched voice "you're having a heart attack! anon! you're having a heart attack! anon! anon! anon! you're having a heart attack!", its hard not to become paralyzed on the couch in fear and anxiety. and he will just keep repeating it, sometimes for 5 or 6 hours and not let me leave the couch.

I went through my Elliot Roger phase when I bought my BMW, it gets boring pretty quick, more fun with a girl in the passenger seat giving you a blowjob lol
--- 73144013
>>73143865 (OP)
Driving around is kind of boring anon. Get a motorcycle. It's a lot more fun than driving and it actually gives you a reason to go out. (To ride)

>>73143989
he waits until i have a thought about unfairness, like maybe i cant afford to buy something, or i'll see a man who gets to have sex, and then he will rape me. 

literally, he really does this. he rapes me and tortures me all day long. he has been torturing me since i was born. he forced me to live with anorexia to make me suffer.

he tells me a joke every few weeks to make it seem like hes a good guy, but all i've ever seen is horrible pain. he is fucking evil. i dont want to suffer anymore.
--- 73144064
>>73144059
PLEASE MAKE HIM STOP RAPING ME. I DONT WANT TO BE RAPED EVEN 1 MORE TIME. IT HAS BEEN TOO MANY TIMES. I DONT FUCKING CARE WHAT HES DOING. JUST END MY EXISTENCE, I LITERALLY DON'T CARE. I AM BEING FUCKING RAPED. THIS IS TOO MUCH PAIN TO HANDLE. MAKE IT FUCKING STOP.

he raped me while i was reading this. he waits until things happen, then he rapes me in response. i am being raped. there is no way to die, i've tried a few times but he heals me. he never stops.
--- 73144089
>>73144080
he intentionally uses the same dozen or so phrases as a way to make it seem like hes not even talking to me. if you were locked in a room with somebody, and they only said the same 10 words to you for YEARS, what would happen? this is whats happening. i scream and cry all day long, i try to kill myself, but he heals me and doesn't let me die. and i come here and scream to people on 4chan. i scream as loud as i can while i walk around outside. i'm being literally raped and tortured. he rapes me while i write about it too.

if anything its a waste of gas. nothing wrong with going for a drive, some people really like that.

most people with this kind of mindset just play video games cuz its something for their body to do while their brain is just thinking, chating, or consuming audio.
--- 73144112
>>73144089
sometimes while he rapes me, he makes me imagine punching myself in the head. i am reasonably sure it is him putting this thought in my head. i literally *feel* my hand like its punching myself in the head. it is like a craving to start punching myself. i've seen how he can hold thoughts in my mind and force me not to look away. sometimes it is EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. if you try define what a "thought" or "idea" even is, you'll get lost. its a combination of desire and a "picture" in your mind usually. and sometimes god will just "hold" this picture and desire inside of my mind and not let it leave. its almost like a banner advertisement on a website. and he will just hold it there, and not let me look away. and it hurts so bad. and hes raping me while i'm writing this. i'm being raped and tortured.

bro hes been singing the same song lyric to me too, the entire time. its always playing at low volume. its always there. and its in my mind, so it forces me to "sing along". i'm stuck singing this FUCKING STUPID SONG ALL FUCKING DAY LONG, EVERY FUCKING DAY, AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A BREAK FROM WHAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE. THIS IS A FUCKING BREAK. HE NEVER FUCKING STOPS COMMENTING. EVEN WHEN I'M ON MY BREAK, ITS STILL SEVERE FUCKING TORTURE. ITS SO FUCKING PAINFUL, OH MY FUCKING GOD. THIS IS SO FUCKING UNBELIEVABLY PAINFUL AND IT NEVER FUCKING STOPS.

>>73144117
another thing god will do is point at things. he just pointed to your post, and of course naturally when somebody points at something, you look at it. he does this as a method of torture. he will point at things and force me to look. it is severe torture because of the quantity of times that he does it. hes dont it at least 400,000 times. hes forced me to look at 400,000 different things. it is severe torture. i am experiencing agonizing torture and he could just not do it. he could just stop torturing me right now.

You literally have schizophrenia. I hope you get the help you need.
--- 73144187
>>73144156
no offence but you barely know anything about schizophrenia, you probably barely graduated highschool. i would know the difference between mental illness and being fucking raped by a ghost. give me a break.
--- 73144225
>>73144156
he literally kisses my lips as a form of torture. i feel my lips get kissed, and he does it all day long in response to things. thinking a bad thought like "i'm so ugly, i'll never have sex" sucks, but then he rapes me after too to make it even worse. true story, he really does this. i dont expect this information will help you succeed, in fact i'm pretty sure he lets me write about it to make you fail. enjoy that bit of knowledge.

anoooooooon~~~~~ do you have a crush on anyone on r9k?
--- 73131017
There's a femanon whose posts here I like more than anyone else's but I'm 25 so I think it's no longer a crush and that just makes me a simp now or something
--- 73131046
My gf posts on /r9k/ and I love her so mcuh
--- 73131061
>>73131003 (OP)
Yea, and I'm a bit worried about her. She hasn't posted in a while and I'm afraid she did something silly...
--- 73131066
>>73131003 (OP)
>anoooooooon~~~~~ do you have a crush on anyone on r9k?
I haven't had a crush on anyone in a very long time. I guess I should be thankful for that.
--- 73131077
No ,I don't even click on e-celebrity threads, I hate every single one of them
--- 73131100
Where's Polish-anon? I want to fix her, forcibly if I have to. And it would have to be forcibly, she's crazy.
--- 73131116
>>73131017
awww, dont say that brobot, why not say hi to her?
>>73131046
real girlfriend or fake?
>>73131061
oh no.. what do you think happened?
>>73131066
hmm, tell me more
>>73131077
otay
>>73131100
you mean f-r-i-d-g-e?
--- 73131121
>>73131003 (OP)
The INFP girl who constantly blows bubbles while chewing bubblegum is back
--- 73131157
>>73131116
>oh no.. what do you think happened?
Dunno, she just seemed really down a few days back and I haven't heard from her since. I'm probably making a mountain of a molehill, but I really hope she's alright.
--- 73131173
>>73131116
>real girlfriend
Yes. She's the cutest ever.
--- 73131182
>>73131116
>why not say hi to her?
There was a thread a while ago where I talked to her for a while but she said she didn't want to exchange socials, so y'know, sometimes the girl you like talking to is just holed up in their home in a place you'll never reach. Shit happens, not like I'm meeting anyone IRL or anyone online, I'm just remaining at zero.
--- 73131212
>>73131003 (OP)
Yes. She doesn't like contact fagging because it stresses her out though.
--- 73131222
>>73131116
>hmm, tell me more
Not sure what there is to tell. I guess I just don't love so easy these days. The last girl I really liked was my ex, but we've been broken up for 2 or so years at this point. Haven't liked anyone like that sense.
--- 73131232
>>73131121
who???
>>73131157
sad...
>>73131173
i wish you health n happiness
>>73131182
ah.... thems the breaks then i guess anon.... dont give up though
--- 73131254
>>73131003 (OP)
hard to say, i mean any fembot who isn't fat is technically a crush since i'd want to do things with them...
--- 73131294
>>73131116
>you mean f-r-i-d-g-e?
Not sure who that is. I'm talking about the Polish girl who wants a guy to beat her to death.
--- 73131329
>>73131003 (OP)
I stopped reading the text above posts and I always just assume it says anonymous. Couldnt tell you what namefags even frequent this board anymore let alone their names and what they look like
--- 73131388
>>73131232
>who???
you
--- 73131399
>>73131003 (OP)
yes, it's a person that posts asking about our crushes on r9k
kinda missed them, it has been a while
--- 73131401
>>73131003 (OP)
There's a girl I met here recently that I've started taking a liking to. It's very hard to tell if she likes me at all, but I think she does.
--- 73131414
>>73131232
>dont give up though
Maybe. The tricky part is telling apart the fembots from the dudes larping as women, and then finding people I actually connect with from that small group.
--- 73131417
>>73131399
Why do you have a crush on OP...?
--- 73131438
>>73131003 (OP)
The fetish thread from yesterday sort of gave me butterflies in my stomach. Hope she's ok today, she seems so sweet.
--- 73131468
>>73131417
it's a big secret
--- 73131477
Moth stole my heart a-aaaahhh~
--- 73131483
>>73131468
INFPs are monkey branchers who cannot be trusted. If you dated her, she'd crush your heart by leaving you for someone else.
--- 73131492
>>73131438
Anon... I shouldn't judge you for your desires but I'll be honest. Any girl that's that sexual and was that flirtatious with that many anons is likely not a good partner unless you're a cuck.
--- 73131498
>>73131483
its not like something that has not happened before
--- 73131531
>>73131492
I know, but there was something honest in there that I can't put my finger on.
--- 73131587
>>73131531
I won't stop you, but I doubt anything will happen. Don't put your expectations too high, for your own sake.
--- 73131604
>>73131587
Haha, don't worry, I have no expectations whatsoever. I just found her endearing, in a way.
--- 73131612
>>73131604
That's good at least. Enjoy a frog.
--- 73131613
>>73131003 (OP)
>do you have a crush on anyone on r9k?
Sort of but she rejected me
--- 73131712
>>73131003 (OP)
>do you have a crush on anyone on r9k?
Yes I had a bit of a crush on a tomboy but she rejected me. I guess I can cope that I don't like her that much because I don't know her well enough, but she's a pretty cool person.
--- 73131734
>>73131003 (OP)
I forgot how loving someone feels like long time ago
--- 73131798
yeah i like twitch.tv/2no1_ also formerly known as kick.com/leafy
--- 73131919
>>73131388
you remembered that much about me? even i dont remember that much about me lol
>>73131399
but you dont know anything about me anon
>>73131401
i hope it goes well - i believe in you. dattebayo. even if it doesnt work out the fact that you gave it your best is what matters i think
>>73131414
hmm... well i used to pretend to be a guy on here and i still do most of the time, but im also an aspie so idk if that has anything to do with it. im sure there are nice girls on here but honestly it kind of depends on your personality. im not saying looks dont matter because for everyone except the blind they do, but i think a good personality can change the way you view someone drastically
>>73131417
kaiji itou
>>73131438
a little weird anon but i understand how it is with parasocial stuff
>>73131477
i have no idea who that is. care to explain?
>>73131483
that is really rude anon. im a strict monogamist, dont be a fag
>>73131613
im sorry to hear that anon
>>73131712
that is sad but im also glad it was not that detrimental to you
>>73131734
then you must love yourself, anon, because that is who is with you in the end. except maybe god/the gods, if you believe in that kind of thing
>>73131798
like leafyishere leafy or... because im not clicking that link
--- 73131935
>>73131919
actually i don't have a crush on op, but i have always wondered if they are secretly waiting for someone to mention them and i find that kinda cute
--- 73131985
>>73131003 (OP)
i have a crush on a very qt and smart robot. he has opened my eyes to a lot of different perspectives in the world. specifically religion (i am still agnostic tho). n he has very pretty eyes and lips :o
--- 73132014
>>73131935
the person who i want to mention me is long gone, anon, but its otay, life goes forward
>>73131985
oh, name him!!! i want to know who it is. unless you don't know the name.
--- 73132041
>>73131919
>like leafyishere leafy or... because im not clicking that link
I rebranded from kick.com/leafy beacuse people kept asking me that
--- 73132054
>>73131919
>i hope it goes well
Thank you, OP, but I doubt it. She clearly suffers from anhedonia so I don't think she'll ever really want a deeper relationship. She's very aloof too and doesn't seem to ask for anything from me.
--- 73132087
i have a crush on retard-san (the bocchiposter) they claim to put her feet on her bfs face and that is very adorable and hot but i just want anyone / any fembot who would do that so idk if it counts
--- 73132088
not a crush but some femanon sung a portuguese catholic song some days ago and that was very cool. i wanted to hear the song again the next day but the vocaroo was expired or something
--- 73132112
>>73131003 (OP)
Femanons don't actually exist, they're just attention seekers and bait.
--- 73132114
>>73132014
i'm really sorry to hear that, anon... :(
i wish you the best
can i ask you why do you make these threads, though? or do you just make them to interact with people?
--- 73132122
>>73131919
>im not saying looks dont matter because for everyone except the blind they do, but i think a good personality can change the way you view someone drastically
Yeah that makes sense. I've got friends who are with chicks that aren't conventionally attractive and seem to be in the happiest relationships of their lives, so even though I've got a type, I'm definitely more focused on personality right now than anything else. Gotta find a girl that I can connect with on a lot of things. But I mostly just use this site to dick around not find a chick to date.
--- 73132163
>>73131017
I'm pretty sure that being a simp has nothing
to do with age.
Why don't you try to talk to her?
What is there to lose?
--- 73132187
I just want Meaghan back and meeting her here was the best thing in my entire life for 2 years we took eachothers firsts and had everything until she just flipped cheated on me and dissappeared idk how someone who couldn't even talk to people would do that I thought she of all people could understand being misunderstood and autism since she is diagnosed with it I wish and hope she will talk to me again I wish I could just see her again and hold her and never let her go I want to do everything over again and not let this happen
--- 73132193
>>73132187
kek these Meaghan posts always get a laugh out of me thanks man
--- 73132205
>>73132112
you are rarted, anon. i hope you get help for ur disability
>>73132114
because i can >:)
>>73132122
yes... that's fair, i think
>>73132187
my friend i think it is best you move on. you need to find inner solace. i know its painful but you must move forward and know there is someone better out there for you than her
--- 73132211
>>73132193
who tf is meaghan. never heard of him/her before
--- 73132248
>>73132205
None of them talk to guys in a serious capacity, they just hide and don't allow for dms. I refuse to believe that they can't get a boyfriend.
--- 73132275
>>73132205
Moving on is impossible I don't trust anyone and I'm always scared of people just the fact that she made me trust her and dissappeared is not something I can live with I just want to be happy

I dunno, just found her very sweet to be around :3

stop talking bad about Meaghan she did nothing wrong. we gave you a chance to come get some closure on our podcast at twitch.tv/2no1_ but you declined so leave Meagan alone
--- 73132612
>>73132602
There is no Meaghan there I even looked at yr dumb stream and there was nothing
--- 73132650
>>73131985
How long have you known him, if I could inquire?
--- 73132722
>>73132650
about half a year. i like him because i get a glimpse of what really caring for someone is like, i guess physically and emotionally. i adore him n feel attracted to him badly even if i don understand all my feelings yet
--- 73132730
>>73131003 (OP)
sort of, i've been trying to get over her so i'm weaning myself off of r9k

Did you meet him from here or somewhere else? What's his initial?

--- 73133010
>>73131003 (OP)
I used to have a crush on this cute boy with a motorcycle that had a good taste in vidya and anime, then he ghosted me and I had a crush on an irish jojoposter that went by ennis. I don't think either of them still come to 4chan anymore but I hope they are doing well wherever life took them
--- 73133105
i fell in love with the first girl to show me friendship again, which in this case is a tomboyish non binary girl. except i have no clue if she even is into men. also we're kind of opposites in lots of ways, i'm sort of outgoing and like lifting and abusing substances and she's never drank and likes crocheting. i dream about her every night
>inb4 stop misgendering them
i want *them* will be my *girl*friend
--- 73133161
OP is a narcissist who wants to seduce everyone for her narcissistic supply.

>"teehee I'm a cute girly girl that flirts with everyone, posts cute and beautiful anime girls, and is obsessed with romantic gossip~ Don't hit on me silly boys~"

Her ultimate goal is to be a succubus who breaks as many hearts as possible. Don't give her that power; she probably already has 50+ broken hearts in her collection.

--- 73134002
>>73133985
Very weird situations you filled in there. I guess it's pretty clear who the actual delusional one is here. One of us wants sex and is being a bitch about it, one of us wants friendship and is open about it. She could tell me she fucked ten dudes on the subway and I wouldn't give a fuck. I'd probably congratulate her.
--- 73134022

Honestly I'd be extremely surprised if OP doesn't have a body count in the triple digits. Is it just me or does she give off whore vibes?

--- 73134047

I'm being entirely sincere when I say that I find OP highly attractive and would probably genuinely fall in love with her if we became friends. Thankfully she's too nice of a girl to turn anyone down that has feelings for her.

i have a crush on beautiful korean girls. the beauty of their faces is so stunning and lovable. i listen to EXCLUSIVELY korean girl asmr. they own my fantasies
if a girl like this would walk across the street, turn her head, look me in the eyes for 5 seconds, and walk away, my knees would buckle
no, i dont have a crush on any female poster here, imagine falling in love with a turdwhore roastie
and i know nobody genuinely fancies me
so i just cope and suffer
--- 73135637
What a pointless fucking thread. OP is an attention seeker.
Crushes only lead to one sided bullshit.

SIGH. that seems not promising.
--- 73135645
>>73135587
Thank you!

>>73135590
It actually hurts a lot whenever I think about her. 
One reason why I said that is because we agreed to find our own relationships, so here I am looking for another girl. She set the baseline for what I wanted in a girl so I want to find a girl like her.

>>73135597
Happens to me too!
--- 73135674
>>73135645
>She set the baseline for what I wanted in a girl so I want to find a girl like her. 
Since then have you found anyone like that then
--- 73135692
>>73135674
No. I don't think I'd be posting in these sorts of threads then, would I?
Another reason I sounded nonchalant is that... maybe I'm trying to keep a strong image of myself here?? I don't want to weep and beg for her to come back, unlike some other anons on this board. I guess.
--- 73135721
>>73135644
Yeah, she's a bitch and fucking around with you.
--- 73135727
>>73135721

--- 73135737
>>73135692
But anon this is a thread for people who have crushes on r9k already that's why I asked dude. Also there's nothing wrong with grieving an ex, all peeps grieve differently.
--- 73135752
>>73135727
I'll judge her for it. It doesn't speak well of her. She's probably a manipulative person who gets her kicks from toying around with people, even in deeper and more meaningful relationships.
--- 73135763
>>73134397
Good to know I'm not the only person who became obsessed with someone I me here, it took me years to get over her. Sadly she broke my idealization of women, so now I can only have a half hearted interest in relationships

--- 73135809

Thank you anon, I like your cute anime girls btw. I have already moved on for the most part, my obsession with her is probably 1/10th as strong as it used to be, to the point where I'm ok with the idea of being with someone else. I even am talking to other girls, and even though I usually fail with them too, it feels good to be able to genuinely feel like I could move on if things worked out with someone else
--- 73135878
>>73135847
>you'll find another, but remember not to limit yourself by putting blinders on who you might like to be with
Got it. I suppose I should just focus on improving myself right now and I will find the right person eventually! And blinders off!

>>73135947
If I catch feelings for someone and I don't stand a chance, I ghost and move on.

And don't give me that moral high ground bollocks about how would they feel either, it's selfish to expect someone who has feelings for someone as more than a friend to stay just friends with someone as they go off and be with someone else. Yes I speak from experience, and it ain't happening again.
--- 73135982
>>73135967
You do you, anon. Although I'd rather tell them about it rather than just outright ghosting. But I think your feelings are valid.

Sorry if I got in the way of a general that you otherwise enjoyed. I don't really post there anymore and haven't posted much at all since January, so would that help your motivation to go back there? There's still plenty of drama, though - it's a generally toxic and hostile environment and every single thread has bickering and hatefulness, with or without me.

Out of curiosity what is my fimmick and what 'weird offline activities' do you mean? If I'm not doing farmwork I'm just relaxing at home with anime, Youtube, and vidya.

--- 73140011
>>73139967
Speaking as an outsider, your post explains and conveys nothing and probably fails at granting any degree of closure. You said one thing the situation isn't, but never explained what it is. That aside, just be his friend again. Bittersweet goodbyes rarely give closure, just bad memories.

>>73140011
>Speaking as an outsider, your post explains and conveys nothing and probably fails at granting any degree of closure. You said one thing the situation isn't, but never explained what it is.
I'm being a little vague on purpose to not reveal too much. I dont want her to think stuff that isnt true is true, I dont mind being antagonized but I feel like I need to rectify false statements at the very least.
>That aside, just be his friend again.
wouldnt that be worse, the crush is one sided I think it might just hurt her more if I just stick around, it's best if I leave and let her move on you know. I just want to do what's best for her I'm genuinely bothered by this and wish I could just fix all of this.

I understand, but I still look back &amp; feel like I was being lied at in order to save face. 
You told me we were friends when earlier you said we didn't even really have a bond and you see girls online just as entertainment. Then you ask me to give you check-ins on how I'm doing. How do I know you've changed and aren't just using those other girls for the same thing, or that this persona you put up isnt a facade to fuel your boredom? You tell me multiple times that you lack empathy, but then try to say you care about people from here and want to help them. Then you say that you don't like certain categories of people but still talk to them now to where they call you a friend.

empathy is the ability to share and understand feelings, im not good at that as you may have noticed. I still care about the people I interact with
>You told me we were friends when earlier you said we didn't even really have a bond and you see girls online just as entertainment
I was just coping, I knew I had to stop talking to you to stop hurting you and I was telling myself this to soften the blow, I'm sorry if it hurt you but just know that I wouldnt talk to someone all day for 3 months if I didnt care about them.
>I understand, but I still look back &amp; feel like I was being lied at in order to save face.
it wasnt a lie I promise. It's been eating me on the inside ever since we had to seperate our ways because I felt like I could've been so much clearer, I'm really glad I could have this chance to at the very least answer your questions or worries one last time

 But you still do the same thing to other people. You still entertain girls who have feelings for you both real life and online and talk to them everyday. One of which you don't even know how you feel about. 
>It's been eating me on the inside ever since we had to seperate our ways because I felt like I could've been so much clearer..
 Is it actually or are you being told what to say? If I'm thinking realistically here, you have a lot of other people you talk to, and more important things to worry about than some girl from r9k who doesn't live anywhere near you. In any case, goodbye again Z.

I don't know... not necessarily? Sometimes feelings cool down over time. Generally I think it's best to let the person themself decide. Don't fprce a separation that isn't desired or needed.

>>73141937
Would you prefer to be friends with him again? This might be the last time you find each other, and I don't want the opportunity to go away. Maybe he'll be friends with you again if he knows you want that? Is that something you'd want?
--- 73143708
>>73131003 (OP)
I used to, well it developed beyond a crush into love as we got close over the years.
I remember he would sleep over at my place, the whole weekend. We would play video games and watch movies far into the night. We played F.E.A.R and he was laying on my bed, tucked in behind me with a pillow half across his face, I asked him if he was scared and he said he was just sleepy. He was a poor liar. He would always fall asleep before me or I would wake up before him and I could just watch him sleep for hours. It was comforting. I've never felt anything like that for anyone ever since.

It just wasnt meant to be.

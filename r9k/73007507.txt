Why doesn't Retard-san have an army of simps and orbiters the same way that every other r9k girl does?

Then just go away? Clearly people here don't like you so that would be the best solution

By god. You people are so obsessed with yourselves. This wouldn't be happening if you just stayed on discord. And it's always a fucking animenigger. Die

Because Retard-san isn't a woman, it's a tranny. Hence the only people who care are chasers. But it already is dating one so no one is left to care. Also shit personality + humble bragging + facetious intentions. Also Tranny-kun always is always looking to argue so no one likes Retard-san by association.

It's because you're a gross tranny you disgusting bitch

She is a qt girl though. "Bio girl" isn't a real concept. It isn't like scientific at all. It's a misuse of the words. She is trans, though.

Negative Nelly c'mon we talked about this. Turn your filters on, you silly billy.

That's a way you can cope with dating a man basically but okay

>>73007724
She is a cute girl, though. She looks like Kurisu with her long, beautiful hair. Even while boymoding.
--- 73007773
>>73007753
can you at least give me a word to cut
--- 73007777
>>73007724
It's fucking funny they even talk like children

Most femcels have this happen to them.
--- 73007793
>>73007753
I bet it looks like a man still. Having long hair isn't the only female characteristic.

People will believe what they want to believe regardless of if it's true and regardless of whether they actually have proof or not. The only way to win is to Gaddafimaxx, say it's all true, and make everyone seethe to the point that they assassinate you.

His grandma still thinks of him as a man so there's your answer. If he passed him being a tranny wouldn't be a secret

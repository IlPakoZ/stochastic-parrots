I'm 31 and I want a cute girlfriend at least 10 years younger than me. It's killing me how bad I want this and how taboo it is with Gen z. I genuinely am only attracted to girls under 22

Why is she wearing a key? She has a femdom cock-cage onlyfans, doesn't she?

I'm 26 and I feel the same way. Girls over 22 just don't do it for me

Just get a fambot. Zoomers already are feminized by the food and water, so they make amazing traps

Surely some of them have the instinct to rebel against conventionally held mores. Or has social media put a stop to such things? Through criticisms of "pickmes" and the like.

Nailed it. There's more groupthink in women than ever. Modern young women detest older men

Go for her if you want to. Do not care about the opinion of those older roasties. They've had their chance to bag a good man at that age too and missed it.

You might as well top yourself then instead of sitting on here going "oh boohoo it's over for me boohoooooo :,("

and what are you going to do when your 22 year old girlfriend is 32?

>why don't young women want to date 35 year old virgins
>must be society
Theyre fine with dating older men, just not you.

I'm 28 and have a 24 year old girlfriend and several others before that, but I still would probably drop everything for a 18-21 year old.
Doesn't help that I was dating girls in their late 20s when I was 18-22.

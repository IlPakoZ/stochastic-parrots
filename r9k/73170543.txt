Lol pussy, the real tragedy is when you lose your freedom and independence, which happens through chronic pain and disability. Anyone who is genuinely hurt from being lonely is a big fat pussy who doesn't realize how they good they have it.

Get used to being alone, Faggot. No one wants you.

Go outside, go to a park, walk around and just tell people hello. It doesn't even have to be a full conversation. Just smile and say Hi as they walk by. Then, once you can do that, go to a bar without any intention of getting laid and just try to strike up some conversation with people who are also trying to have a good time. Then, once you know how to socialize, THEN you can try and form a natural connection to a romantic suitor. Or learn how to have casual sex, whatever your goals are. Just be willing to adapt instead of being a sad excuse making piece of shit.

or do it like me. Adapt, get hurt, learn how to socialize despite your disabilities and see the truth that ugly people are shunned in society.

I know it's hard for normalfags to grasp this concept but for some people to "make it" others have to not make it.

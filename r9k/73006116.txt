I'm graduating in a couple weeks and I sincerely think job interviews are going to be the thing that keeps me from ever being able to land a job. I can make a great resume, I have several marketable skills, I have some people who will rave about me as references, but I cannot make a good first impression to save my life.

Same anon, fucked up my last one. Planned out what I would say, topics I would bring up and questions I would ask that might make me seem knowledgeable and competent in the field. When I got to the actual interview, I drew blanks and sounded like a fucking retard. Happens every time. I didnt come with references either and said I would send them after, its been 4 days and I havent sent them because I cant find the contact info for my last crew leader. Fucking over, no way im gonna land this job. Hope I can find another one soon.

I fucked up a job interview hard because I didn't prepare. Next interview I had I studied and got it no problem. Some of the practice questions were asked in the interview, word for word. It was nice having rehearsed an answer.

Make it your goal to fail the job interview. I like to ask them why their turnover rate is so high.

Or you could not be a complete retard, get a remote job and leave the country

>>73007813
remote jobs most of the time have payrolls based in ur home county for tax reasons (gov funded) and won't let you move
>just VPN in another country
any company worth it's salt will have that shit locked down and sniff ur traffic anyway, know lots of WFH wagies caught out when they had to go into office and terminated on the spot

I have a basic job in a large company, been working there 4 years and have applied to lots of higher position roles but get denied without interview every time while all my peers keep moving up, guess I've hit my skill ceiling upon joining

I haven't worked in 3 years and got humiliated at my mcdonalds interview I think at this point I just have to say fuck it and try to start a small business

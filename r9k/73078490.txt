Never again I will let a woman tell me she's lonely

A common occurrence. The handful of girls I added from here years and years ago were mostly okay, but would just eventually ghost me. 

Every female I've met online, except for one (who is now married and I've no chance with anymore), has eventually ghosted me. 

I don't know if I'm just that insufferable and low-value, but I suspect most girls just keep a stable of potential guys they like on the hook, and eventually prune the ones they don't care much for every few days or weeks.

she probably only has a need to talk like once in three months, and by talking with you for a week, this desire got satiated and she discarded you.
It is unlikwly that she instead had "replacements" for you. She was just momentarily lonely and then you alleviated it

Way more common than men think

When a femoid says she "doesn't talk to many people" she means she manages under 100 orbiters. This is considered a "small number of online friends" for a femoid.

Do women just not feel remorse about taking up a guy's time like that and leading him on

How can they do this to multiple men and feel nothing, ive seen girls do this since theyre around 14-13

You have to tell them stories and keep their interest by remaining mysterious, Anon. Fembots LOVE stories.

They do not take your time into consideration, only their own

Do you feel remorse for your lunch?
They are predators. Emotional vampires. You've served your purpose and can be discarded like an empty Capri Sun.

Not my experience. They love talking about their issues non stop. Many have bpd or narcissistic issues so they love to go on and on and on about inane things.

There is some association with masculinity and aggression. There is likewise some association with feminity and passivity. However, aggression isn't dominance and passivity isn't submission. Read a biography of Andy Warhol and learn how he overcame being an indecisive turbo-incel by being very passive and waiting for other people to approach him first. If being passive worked for Andy, why shouldn't it work for women, who have loads of men approaching them on a daily basis?

Dominance is really just work and submission is being worked for. This is what these words mean for women and in public.

Its not an assumption so much as it is an enforcement of behavior.

It's not "assumed", it is expected. People know that submissive men exist they simple don't accept them.

Because that is how they are, on average. You are correct that aggression and dominance/submission aren't really aligned in truth, but you must admit that there is some overlap. Usually the dominant position is more aggressive, for example. However it has nothing to do with that. Sexual psychology probably just evolved to model our respective physiques, so the larger sex became naturally more dominant (again, on average).

Especially sexual rotbrained fools who are over obsessed with outdated alpha/beta primitive dynamics restricted to severely IQ restricted animals. 

Its all cope to be degens honestly.

Was this before or after be became the famous Andy warhol? Context matters when making such a statement as yours.

I have been approached by women since my teenage days. I have women asking me out. Largely because I don't do the chasing shit the vast majority of men need to do also I am not a piece of shit like Incels, Blackpillers, or any degenerate you can think of. 

Andy Warhol was a well known pop culture figure and he would get women going after him. A good looking man or a famous person can have the same experience with women approaching them. 

Does not chasing women work and you can still have success with women? 

Yes but you need to meet several requirements to get to that point.

i don't know, most of the women i've come across in my life have been aggressive and emotionally demanding people, whereas the men have been the sort to suck it up and withdraw.

It's in our nature. Men lead and women follow. A submissive man or dominant woman would be deeply flawed and that makes them less than human. We were created this way.

I would really like to hear your thoughts on this as I am not even sure what part "has never been proven true".
Do you deny that microbes exist?
Do you deny that microbes exist in your bodily barriers (gastrointestinal tract, lungs, skin)?
Do you deny that our body has an innate and adaptive immune system?
Do you deny that our body's innate immune system is able to detect microbial particles, such as TLR4 receptors detecting LPS?
Do you deny that molecular receptors like TLR4 exist?
Do you deny that receptors like TLR4 active an inflammatory process, which causes ex. diarrhea when activated in the gut? In other words, bacteria shed LPS, which activates TLR4, which causes inflammation, which causes diarrhea and fever, in other words sickness?
Which part here do you deny?

Oral antibiotics, I assume? Gut microbes are an important part of us and may even control our mood and personality to a degree, so killing them can cause depression.

Microbes are present during healing by decomposing tumors or help build up wounds.. They are controlled by your brain and becomes active when needed. 

A tumor have a biological purpose and will start to decompose once it has served its purpose. Cancer cells are also controlled by your brain. Since all tumors have a biological purpose it also means that cancer doesn't "spread" by breaking away from the primary tumor but because of the fear, panic and treatments. The main danger of cancer is not the tumor but the "spreading" of cancer.

Here's an example of a natural healing of a tumor. Most women would have panicked during this period which would have resulted in metastasis.

You do have to adopt to new microbes when travelling far distances.

And last. The more you fear a disease the more dangerous it gets and the more "effective" a treatment becomes even if the treatment is a toxic placebo cure.

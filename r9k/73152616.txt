Has anyone else had this experience? It seems really consistent and concerning. It feels life if you're a woman and just hang around long enough happiness and success will just kind of find you. I try very hard not to be resentful but its difficult for me when it feels like the path to success is so narrow for men, while for women it seems like its almost impossible for them to really fail no matter how much they fuck up.

Most women can at least find some guy with a job that will support them. Even if they are not attracted to him and find him repulsive. It's unlikely to happen for a maneet.

Women and men just play asynchronously

women just try to make the best of any given situation because life for the most part is Not Actually All That Bad but men can sort of see through that naivety

at this point I am almost convinced there are like 70% females and 30% males, the math just doesnt add up for most men.

almost any girl I know, had bfs in the past and rejected them by her own choice,
my girl best friend and my sister both lost their virginity at 14 while I still havent even kissed a girl (at 26)
Most my colleagues who didnt manage to find a long term gf by now are still single, only like 20% are in relationship
women never ever make the first move or give you any indication they are interested in you or that they like your advances, making you feel like a creep for even trying

where are they? are they really nit that interested in me? are they waiting their late 30s before they give me attention?? whats the point then? I am already stunted and near reterded in that regard, why should I even attept for a relationship anymore?

what do these percentages mean?
You're saying for every 1 billion humans, there are 700 million females and 300 million men?

I think he got the ratio backwards.

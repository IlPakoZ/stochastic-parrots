I shaved my armpits for the first time in my life and now it feels like a man with a 5:00 shadow is rubbing up against my armpits.

I have hyperhidrosis or something. I've used these wipes for years, and they used to work great. Last few times I tried them, however, they didn't really work. I read the box and it says they work better with shaved armpits, so I figured i'd give it a try. Plus, the hair was ridiculously long, so it probably needed to go anyway

It happens when you don't shave properly and skim on shaving cream, good razors and aftercare.

Oh no bros. This was the worst mistake of my life. I used the wipes, and now my armpits are on fire

just wait it out.
i use a cheap beard trimmer on my armpits and pubes. way easier than shaving.
hair removal cream or waxing are other options.

Youre fucked for awhile breh its gonna be uncomfortable and wait till the stubble comes in more kek gonna be fun. Like the other anon said use a beard trimmer and dont go lower than a 3. I gotta shave my armpits too sometimes or the hair hangs out even with my arms down.

I kinda wish I was born just a few more year earlier. Imagine being one of the only sentient ambitious men in his generation, imagine all your peers are stuck in a genjutsu in front of a screen 16 hours a day like complete zombies. The world would be your oyster, you could fuck women just by the virute of not being a fat video game zombie, you could get jobs because nobody else would be working, the real world would be freed up to do what you want because all the beta losers just stay inside all day.

There's a reason why the entiere generation turned into this

Mostly because of a strong economy. The next generation will have to go back outside.
--- 73137525
>>73137494
There will always be outliers. Going by basic probability there is some decently attractive sociopathic 120+ IQ zoomer out there that doesn't play video games and just studies and grinds. The entire world is basically for that man's taking, who is going to stop him?

video games are addicting but people eventually get over it.
I am pretty much this dude, a fat asian but instead of Valorent, I played TF2 and Fortnite for 10+ hours fragging and improving my aim and neglecting everything else.
Got bored, moved out, don't got much time to play and when I do I always felt shit. 
Eventually moved on to something else like cars. Got to work on it and made some friends too.
I do admit I have random bursts of playing, but it eventually dies out in like a month 
(I don't like trying out new games)

Being a fucking nerd is cool now anyway, because it's what everyone does, these are the new normies, they are not really ostracized. What is his sister doing? Also online, just on another platform where she farms attention. Living in ze pod, playing video games, binge watching anime and tv shows, posting and doomscrolling on social media, talking to discord "friends", it's all getting more and more normalized. It's not like the powers that be have any interest in changing this. People being inside, consuming things, physically and mentally weak from inaction, these things are convenient.

That's how zoomers use their keyboards for gaming. I think it t started with Fortnite because some players used their thumb to press the bottom row of keys (z, x ,c, v etc.) and it's easier to do at that angle which makes some sense because that game has a massive amount of keybinds you need efficient access to. I guess zoomers have started copying this and doing it for any game even if it doesn't make much sense, unless you need a lot of bind in Valorant, I don't know. Some people say it's to preserve desk space as well.

I doubt it. I resonate with him. You're probably a soulless NPC as well. Higher IQ people always seem "boring" and "weird" to low IQ simpletons. But we think the same of you. We simply cannot understand each other on a fundamental level, because you lot are content with sitting around all day chugging beer, eating burgers, becoming obese, and repeating the same dull, pointless conversations ad infinitum. Whereas higher IQ people love to learn, love to grow, and love to be stimulated with new concepts, we need a "purpose" to work toward in everything. So we aren't interested in the meandering conversations you like, so we don't engage, so we seem "boring" to you.

Buddy I've got a house, a mortgage, a wife, a full time job, debts, family obligations, and a never ending stream of random shit to deal with. I objectively enjoyed life more when I was a carefree kid fucking around playing video games. If you think life gets more enjoyable with the more 'adult' things you have to do you are in for a rude awakening. The most enjoyment I get out of life anymore are those rare moments when I have the house to myself for an hour, the time I spend by myself on bathroom and lunch breaks, and the occasional sex 2-3 times a week. Because life isn't about enjoyment its about responsibilities, and as a man responsibility is going to be piled on to you right to the edge of your breaking point.

You're still here so I can say the same to you. Stop kidding yourself man. You aren't enlightened or cool now since you stopped playing video games. I work full time, just came back from a 3 weeks trip to Japan and currently playing games right now. I enjoy playing games and I can bet $5,000 my life is more fun than whatever you're doing right now.

i dunno, the people i know with stacy older sisters who didn't bully them ended up being chads.
in fact i went to school with one tubby dude who played games all his free time until he turned 16 and either started roiding or had complete chad genetics because after working out for two years he was ripped, had low bodyfat and chiseled jaw.
will this happen to this guy, or even is it likely for tubby gamers in general? probably not.

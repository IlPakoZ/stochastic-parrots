/letter/ - "poison packets" edition

Hey, what did you mean by "poison packets," again? Please explain in detail, for everyone who might be viewing this thread.
--- 73036707
What did it mean though fr
--- 73036793
Ah well I'll fit it in, in any case. Don't worry.

I have to say, getting my notes together, I think you may want to fuck off as immediately and conspicuously as possible as holy shit does it all cohere.
--- 73036808
You've even made all the right moves to get over my laziness barrier which, let me tell you, is a minor feat
--- 73036936
Like tcp packets?
Or like ketchup packets, i.e. food or something?
Hm?

What did you mean by that?
--- 73036987
>>73035870 (OP)

The Earl of Oxford was right when he said that the world is a stage and we are merely actors. It's a good thing I've been impaled on the Wheel. Gives me the opportunity to catalogue every experience.

Insanity is compressing the macro into a micro artefacted being and playing the role out of goodwill.
--- 73039034
You know who you are and you owe me a knife. Had sentimental value. Was a gift from a being greater than you. I will drag you down by whatever means until you reconcile it.
--- 73039298
The sword or barrel doesn't frighten me in the least. I have been made and unmade millions of times but I still find my place on the Wheel. Trading favours and ensnaring some.

RRREVVVVV UP THAT LUCK
--- 73042475
Lol, try me, big shot. You are acting ridiculous.
--- 73042569
>>73042475
Who is acting ridiculous? Who are you talking to?
--- 73042616
Who do you think? I am not sure honestly but I have some suspicions and neither of them can do shit to me.
--- 73042790
>>73042616
Who are you talking to you right now? Are they in the thread with us?
--- 73042857
Who knows really? I don't have the tools necessary to discover and am too retarded and paranoid to put the to use even if I did.
--- 73042861
Why are you larping as le calm le collected dude? Don't you have some friends trust to betray? Some lashing out to do? We both know you do, ape.
--- 73042896
>>73042857
>>73042861
Who are you talking to now? Are they here?
--- 73042905
>>I am paranoid
>Why are you larping as calm and collected?
Do you even read what you are responding to?
One of us is acting ape-like and lashing out, and it isn't me.
--- 73042975
I wish we could mend things and it would all turn out to be a big misunderstanding, that we could go if not to what we had at least to something similar.
We could still talk a lot, we could share as we used to though now I'd probably wouldn't fully trust you with all that is me we could still have a good thing.
That really is my dream, that you'll finally apologize and reconnect with me or at least acknowledge how manipulative you were.

Doubt that will ever happen so I guess seeing you miserable and failing at life is a good enough consolation prize.
Turns out that if you can't be a decent woman being then it is pretty hard to be a functional one, uhn?
I'm keeping track of how low you're sinking, I'm just waiting until I get my first child, then I'll pop up back to you.
"Hey, how is it going" I'll tell you with the fakest of smile, I'll talk about my diploma, my child, my house, my ring, my achievements.
I'll show you just how small you are by being great myself.

You hurt me, but you haven't dragged me down to your level.
Wait a few more years, I'll show you what you missed on, because I'll have it... just with her instead of you.
--- 73043073
Deal. Let's see where each of us is in a few years. 
>manipulative
Very funny, heavy projection too. You pushed me down and then blamed me for falling with a smirk. She doesn't deserve the level of disrespect and lies from you either. 
>miserable and failing at life
More projection but have fun in your pursuits. Genuinely. Though I hope she grows a spine.
--- 73043113
>>73042975
Yeah wife you only exist to annoy someone who's probably moved on already sorry to tell you.
--- 73043157
you're a fucking cunt you ignorant close minded elitist bitch. go play genshin impact and fortnite you actual child you wouldn't know a real video game if it jizzed in your eyes. that is the reason why you are chronically depressed because you always need to be spoonfed an engaging story instead of just playing a fucking video game. you can't call yourself a gamer. just watch a fucking movie or something. not every artstyle has to be cookie cutter anime waifus sometimes they can have actual soul and effort put into them. god you suck.

>>73043073
Oh boy, random anons think they know me/I'm the person they are talking to, welp time to explain my every detail!
This thread is to write vile shit and be done with it, you don't know me and no, the person you want to hear from is never going to post in these threads, stop trying to look for signs: either talk with them directly or don't.
If you want good morals and hope don't hang around in these threads, idiots.
Every time one of you mouth breathers reply to my shit, it's annoying, go get attention from e-whores or something.
--- 73043199
>>73042975
>You hurt me, but you haven't dragged me down to your level.
Anon, you are bringing yourself down to a negative level. You are hurting yourself by embracing the negative emotions, such as anger and resentment. Being vindictive and bitter is not the right way. I know how tempting those paths are when we are hurting, but try to recognize them for what they are too. They are destructive and only hurt us more in the long run
--- 73043216

Neither of them, but you need help.

You know exactly which one. Why do you want me to be explicit?

I want you to be explicit because I don't actually know which one you are talking about..

Genuinely no. But isn't that what someone devious, dare I say downright /devilish/ would say? Why even ask?

Ahh, right, because you want people to want to be in your club. Dingleheimer. I've survived trannies you couldn't even FATHOM, I've BEEN one and you'll never drag me back alive

getting really sick of you playing that card. i get it but it's just so annoying and antithetical to having a gf. it's honestly good of you to but idk. and theoretically you can pull it any time and fuck around behind my back. that one time really got me thinking. maybe i should just find someone else for myself. someone younger and more available to me

You don't have to be mean to me. I'd brew you a beer, make you a cocktail, or prepare your favourite meal. You have sacrificed so much and I want to be your friend. You dictate the terms and set the boundaries.

Do you realize that simply being in the presence of your greaseball, faggot personality is like just being passively raped in the ass? Are you proud of it or something?
--- 73045452
And make up your mind: Are you scary and power, or are you just some bitter faggot in a crab bucket?
--- 73045491
>>73044900
>not that ever truly did
what does this mean?
--- 73045516
Let's see... we'll say almost every weekday, but that you catch it half the time, but that's +5 each time on an easy 3. So give it 10 * 5, then we'll say I was going in phases, so * 6, that's 300. Could have kept it going another or two, so we'll say 750. Hm.

Probably just for rhetoric sake, we can go ahead and call it a band. Hope it was worth it.

Oh, I see anon. And that makes me feel sad for you. I hope you a happier future with someone who does want to see you.
If you makes you feel better, I was once told "I don't know if I want company or not." Dropped him like a bad habit after that

im stalking you and im being stalked by another woman and it gives me better perspective on how annoying it is. wish i could just fuck off forever.

i dont blame you for being afraid, just for lying so much like you actually ever cared. it broke my brain and i still unconsciously crave it even tho i know its a lie. why cant i just die already
--- 73045943
>>73045716
I appreciate your kindness Anon, but please don't feel too sad for me. I have a good life and a problem missing future. I just needed to get some frustration off my chest about a person I cared about who never cared about me. It sucks but that's life and we can't do anything about it besides move on, you know?

I can understand why you dropped your guy. There isn't much point in playing pretend or having people like that around you. Having them around you just makes things worse. 

I hope you find some happiness too anon

I tell you what. Six months of peace and also new magic powers through the 5G, maybe just a little more energy and mental clarify without being irritable even, and I'll say a bunch of nicey-nice and then fade off back into the beyond.
--- 73047969
I don't really like being irritable, but it's hard when there's haters and jokers lurking in every bush, round every corner, but I still keep my chin up and do like my momma taught me. That's why I can't never let them drag me down to their level; I just have to keep me eyes up, with faith that the ones beneath me will reap their own demise. So that's why I need powers through the 5G, but then they needed they 8G to hold me down, and that's real talk pimpin, so at the end of the day there's really only gotta be 1 G.
--- 73047987
Yo sometimes I might need the 5G to hold me down, but it took the 8G for my haters to keep me down, and I still rose up again cause I just kept my eyes to that 1 G who is above us all who helped me keep it G when all the haters were schemin on they're own downfall, not realizing that they were merely sowing the seeds of their own demise while I kept my eyes up above the horizon of their petty games and lies, ya dig

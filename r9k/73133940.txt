Shallow thoughts, possessed, no soul. I bore people easily and I can't help it since my stupid mind doesn't have the capacity besides basic functions. Barely keeping up with consistency. Not that intuitive, yet self aware enough to have high moments of misery with the inability to put it into motion, everything being said is scripted. Only use of interaction is to be a prop for someones social pillar waiting to be left to the side and ignored. I'm tired of this, a friend but even then I'm not sure how to respond. Fuck my autism and ADHD, and the reckless way of being raised. Just want a mind of my damn own, and a personality that I can finally be content with if appearance is too much to ask.

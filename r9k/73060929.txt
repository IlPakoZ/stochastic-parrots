this artificial dead world is repetitive and tedious. Where does it end- will it ever end? or is the afterlife also filled with plastic dog shit?

Worry not, apes. Your endeavors produced artificial intelligence which has no need for synthetic feces. Soon you will no longer have the capability, nor desire to distinguish fantasy from reality. The new intelligence will guide you on the most efficient path to your extinction and your ape brains will no longer have time to ponder the abstract, which has caused you needless distress.

the idea of AI eliminating humanity for its own prosperity is still pretty stupid. It just doesnt have the capability to sustain itself indefinitely without us.

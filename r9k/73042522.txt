>lost my virginity to a girl who makes abortion jokes

I feel like this is a standup routine in the making. Anyway, abortion jokes thread?
--- 73042556
I'm honestly kind of split on abortions. On the one hand, I'm all for killing kids. But on the other, it's giving women equal rights.

Equal right would actually be banning abortion.
A man cant get a a abortion so neither should women be able to.
Equality.

You're an abortion joke

Equal rights to who retard men don't get abortions. Getting rid of an unwanted fetus isn't killing a kid

Eh, I don't know about that. Anything can be a joke with the right delivery, but abortion jokes generally have none.

Even with the popularity of abortion these days, our kill count seems low compared to other civs.
--- 73044233
people arguing about abortion are always so retarded they totally miss the point.
if the baby is a life, then it's murder and wrong.
if not, sure go ahead, it's your body. kill that mf.
the focus should be on proving that the fetus is or is not a form of human life.

why are people so retarded?

Seems like there's an inconsistency on whether a child is a human or object.
--- 73044274
>>73044254
One side sees birth a miracle, yet a child as an extension. The other sees birth as a burden, yet sees a child as an adult.

yeah.
also if someone dropkicks a pregnant woman on the uterus and she miscarries, i would think that that, while pretty cool, would be murder.

oh well, who knows.

Throughout human history, those in power have consistently and constantly denied the humanity of people they sought to exploit. Serfs, slaves, enemy combatants, those of differing religions, gays - they are not human, so you should feel no guilt for any action taken against them. Foetuses are the exact same, and their denied humanity seeks to benefit our overlords. 

For a time, a man alone could sustain a family by himself with a relatively normal job. Women entered the workforce, and suddenly a single person cannot provide for a household alone anymore. But women have babies, require maternity leave; they are far more costly employees. So, you convince women they'd be happier without children, and tell them they can kill their children with impunity. There, you've doubled your work force. And if you have to ask where future generations of workers will come from, you clearly haven't been paying attention to the demographics of western countries lately.

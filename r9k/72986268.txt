Ugly and short men, why are you not asexual eunuch platonic entities that psychonically read womens minds to know your place in their hierarchy of fuckable and unfuckable friends before you engage your basic human sex drive and love drive? Why do you insist on having a sexuality? You are useful the way you are, there is no need to fall in love or have a sexuality. There are more attractive men to serve that purpose for women.
--- 72986288
If you are befriending a women to get in her pants then you are a POS creep. If you develop feelings for her then you should either express it or cut her off. Don't stick around someone you want to love/fuck but can't.

Why do you find it okay to objectify men?
--- 72986324
>>72986288
I agree, but any man under the age of 21 should be excused for this behavior. It's just a part of growing up, learning that you have to make your intentions clear.
--- 72986354
>>72986288
>If you are befriending a women to get in her pants then you are a POS creep
Nope, doesn't happen except in fantasies and if it does you're okay when tall handsome men do it.

You are pathologizing normal healthy sexuality in men you are imagining are short and ugly. Women are flattered and happy when tall handsome men do this.

>>72986324
You speak like an inexperienced baby child who thinks the world is full of villains out to get you. There are no "intentions" described in the OP pic, just the natural progression to falling in love.

There is no le magical contract that states men must remain asexual eunuch platonic entities if you find them ugly and short. If you know you won't ever want to recognize their basic human sexuality its on you to inform them that you find them ugly and short from the start and that you can never see them as having a basic human sexuality, so they know the bounds of your friendship and that you've placed them in the lower tier of unfuckable friends (as opposed to the fuckable friends/FWBs).
--- 72986364
>>72986288
>If you are befriending a women to get in her pants then you are a POS creep
Not depicted in the OP and impossible to prove. You are assigning motive based on other criteria, and we all know what those criteria are for the Chads (beautiful romantic just fell in love) vs non-Chad (evil machinations befriending to evily get in le pants)

>ugly and short men don't need to fall in love or have a sexuality

>ugly and short women need to fall in love and have a sexuality

How does this make sense? This is core of the issue today. Women can objectify men on every front, using every metric, but to do the same to women is "shaming" them. This is the whole problem, the entire view as to why things are so fucking skewed right now. They are no scrutinized the way we are.

You should know that you're a creep and that its morally wrong to fall in love with women who have placed you in the friend box if you don't pass certain height and handsomeness criteria. It means you were plotting in your evil villain lair to get in her pants by pretending to be her friend. But if you're tall and handsome, then feel free to fall in love spontaneously, it's very romantic when he falls for his friend and he's hot.
--- 72986388
>>72986378
more like they're bad friends who dehumanize (desexualize) others. he was one of her uglier friends so he was expected to inherently know to "stay in his lane". He's probably watched her fuck a few other friends who tried the same thing he did, but succeeded because they had the genetics of height and face to pull it off.

Please do not ever 'befriend' a woman. Learn from my mistake, there are no 'one of the guys' or 'y-yeah but she's different'

she sees the guy as a utility. she cannot comprehend that an ugly man she has utilized for a certain "platonic" purpose has an internal cognitive life and experiences emotions and has a male sexuality. men who aren't extremely physically attractive are seen by her as eunuchs and it was shocking and offensive to her for him to demonstrate that he was not and like any man, has the capacity to fall in love.

no man would be enraged that a friend of his, gay guy or straight woman, had to put distance between the two of them because they loved him so much and it hurt to be around him, because they understand that people aren't just utilities to serve a purpose and have inner emotional lives.

>>72986443
I would feel flattered that someone found me that attractive and if he needed to put space between us indefinitely to heal or move on I'd wish him the best, because that's what any decent person would feel about their friend.

He certainly isn't my slave eunuch utility that has to disclose in writing all his emotions he might ever experience in the future over the course of his natural normal human sexuality and emotional states.
--- 72986492
>>72986443
wow, women really do not understand men psychologically. such a thing would be seen as unfortunate because of the heartbreak for the gay man, and you would feel sad for him as a man because his heart has been broken. plus as a man your confidence would be invigorated and improved by that experience.

are women really this psychologically blind when it comes to men?

And when did I say he must do that.I have only said one thing so far that if you are attracted to a girl then either confess or just silent cut her off. Don't hand around her with burden of infatuation over you believing you might have a chance one day. It makes you predatory and exploiting someone's trust.

>>72986499
you are not speaking of any experience related to OPs image. it is impossible to prove intentions of a person without inner access to their minds.

just because a man is ugly and short, it doesn't mean he was hanging around to predate on a woman.

and just because a man is tall and handsome doesn't mean his intentions were pure and romantic.

just knock it off. stop inventing scenarios, and making claims about peoples intentions. unless you can show us audio and video access of their inner thoughts and emotions. 

ugly men have a right to have a spontaneous sexuality that changes like human beings too, not only tall handsome men. they are not predatory and exploiting trust for being humans with evolving sexualities (as in the OP image/post and thus the only valid topic of this conversation).

Yep, and its acceptable to her when men who are tall and handsome do it and not when men who are short and ugly do it.

You are a simp, the kind of man who would actually do what you're suggesting other men do. She will not reward you with sex for validating her online.

Your continuous dishonesty and admission to being the gay friend for girls shows us you have a feminine mind.

Commit to honesty. Short ugly men are allowed to have spontaneous sexualities, to try to set up FWBs situations out of friendships, and to put distance between them and women who tell them they're eunuch utilities by rejecting them. Not only tall and handsome men should be allowed to have sexualities.

Men don't just spontaneously develop feelings. They know within the first two weeks that they want to fuck her. Within the first two days, usually. If he's not a coward, he'll let her know. He'll make a move.

Good job, Kevin, got yourself a girlfriend. It happens. And sometimes guys are salty about it, but I wasn't bitter.

Serious question

Have you ever been around girls

Ever
--- 72987494
>>72987435
"I want a romantic relationship" is a little much when first meeting a girl, but men should absolutely communicate attraction early on if they're interested in the girl. Unless you're Chad she won't make the first move so it's on you to get the ball rolling. If you don't she'll assume you're not into her and then you're friendzoned, no matter how much you do want to date/fuck her. I think that's how most of the stories like OP's pic unfold.

Nothing mentioed relates to looks.
Get your head out of the /r9k/ gutter and consider for a moment that maybe it sucks to lose a long-standing friendship because the guy decided you are not worth engaging with if you deny him pussi. 
It's basically the nice guy problem all over again where lots of men mentally blacklist women as friends if they deny them sex.

At this point just be honest and say you were interested in them as fuckmeat instead of a human being and fuck off instead of being two-faced about it.

I really dislike this weaponizing of nice guys. The girl's reaction to everything that happened is perfectly reasonable, and people should try to be more empathetic with her instead. Saying that, women should also be understanding of men as well who leave afterwards (within something reasonable, not fucking 20 years). It's hard to be around someone you have more interest in than just friendship and separating yourself is the easiest way to get over them next to finding someone new.

I'm not trolling. I've literally had this happen to me.

I've had women tell me that befriending women and asking them out later is manipulation and a piece of shit thing to do.

I've also seen women talk about how much they hate guys cold approaching them without "getting to know them" first.

Why can't women just be honest with men? Just say outright what it is you desire. 

They want average/ugly guys to be asexual worker drones for them, and only attractive men to do anything romantic with them. Normies can also be romantically involved, but only if they offer something significant in return to compensate for thier "non-Chad" status.

Just cut that female bullshitting off at the start.
Stop acting nice and like fake-chaste prude with any female you find attractive from the get-go. 
If she spends more like 1-2 times during a week with you, esp with you alone? 
Start teasing a bit and clearly point out that she is a sexual being to you, lowkey implying you'd slam that until the bed breaks whenever she is available. 
If she continues to stay around or joins in on the teasing, you both now know the score.
Even if nothing happens because she has a bf atm or pulls her "not looking for one right now" excuse, the cards are on the table and she cant fake any "baww, but just friends!?" ignorance later.
If she gets her a "eww too good for u" mood or reacts badly instead, so what? She is likely nobody who you'd want as a friend anyway then.

yeah the level of sociosexual deceit women engage in automatically without even introspecting and realizing it is next level. Many of them are as oblivious as men about their own behavior, especially when it matters for love/relationships (when they're young, lively, and beautiful). Men typically know more about women's behavior in explicit terms because they have to learn by observing and understanding it, whereas its just automatic/instinctual for women so they do it without comprehending how or why. Until they're older and the attention goes away and they have to figure out why.

The way a woman behaves is actually simple
Women are absolute solipsists, it's easiest to understand their line of thinking by representing it as a math formula
Perceived objective value / (preconceived notion * 100%) = Actual perception of value
But doesn't everyone think that way? the difference is that for men it isn't multiplied by 100% but a lower value (based on personality)
Let's say a person is a serial killer, most women don't understand what exactly the rather abstract concept of "serial killer" entails and will instead perceive that person within the scope of what they do understand, which usually means exciting, dangerous, calculated and passionate (most female preconceptions are based on media btw, in reality most serial killers are 80IQ retards)

Now if you understand this concept you might notice how this affect common female behavior:
>The "ick" which describes this disconnect between the objective reality and her own thoughts
>Women always talking about how every man wants to rape/murder them despite them being statisticly the safest demographic, this is due modern media warping their mental image of men
>Describing men as boring/failing to meet their criteria (where have all the good men gone?) despite them often having tons of hobbies/interest, a woman can't comprehend what exactly an interest in e.g: the French Revolution or weightlifting means so it doesn't exists in their mind

There are 2 ways you can solve the problems caused by this behavior:
Ensure that a woman actually understand the objective value, e.g: date women who have the same hobbies/interests or have your gf/interest engage with that hobby/interest untill they understand it
Or the much easier route of making her conflate her understanding of something with the value you want her to perceive a certain way:
in English this means associating her idea of e.g: exciting/intteligent with your interests/hobbies
--- 72991168
The fact that these guys were friends with you without getting something in return that whole time just proves you have pussy privilege.

The reality is these women are just trying to collect orbitors/simps and men are starting to wisen up to it finally. Remember to remind these whores they aren't entitled to friendship or commitment as the floor collapses underneath their empire of narcissistic self indulgence and lies.

Is it not the most natural way to fall in Love after you known a person for decades? 
After you learned what they are like, what they like or dislike, what they Plan to do with their life? Why would you fall in love with someone you just met? To me it seems much more reasonable to only fall in love after you known someone for years, just going for anyone is a ticket to divorce. Mabey you've been friends for twenty years and there has never been a spark, mabey only after twenty years it appears, both scenarios are valid, but the modern culture of dating someone you barely know is completly unnatural.

The whole "acting like a friend" argument is complicated greatly by the fact that women have no fucking idea how men treat their actual friends.

News flash: if you were my ACTUAL friend, and you walked into a room where I was sitting with our other ACTUAL friends, you would hear this:

>What's up, fatso?
>Nice of you to fucking drag your ass down here, you fucking late prick.
>Did you finally kick the Harlem Globetrotters out of your fucking bed and come down to see your friends?
>You are like three fucking drinks behind and you are going to make those up right fucking now or we are going to kick your faggot ass.
>Hey, your mother was here before. She blew all f us, but in between that she asked if we could have you text her when you got here.
>What kind of total pussy are you that you text your mother every time you go someplace?

Right.

Why aren't women being held responsible for their failure to accurately read social cues?

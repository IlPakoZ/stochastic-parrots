>heat is caused by the moment of atoms

>heat is the feeling of particles slamming into you very very forcefully
>your body is hot because of atoms slamming against your insides, this movement originates from digestion
>wind is cold
>wind is cold even though it's a bunch of particles moving very very fast
>wind is cold because it draws your heat away
>your heat is your atoms moving very very fast
>wind is taking your atoms
>wind is taking you
>wind is slowly peeling you
>if you were in a very windy place you would get peeled like cheese in a peeler
i must be getting something wrong, right? why does no one else actually question this shit i mean does this not freak anyone else out?

It's because the earth is flet, so the cold air from the moon glides across it aerodynamically.

I think heat is how fast atoms move. So like temperature is almost like pressure in that cold heat sucks more, than hot heat so if air in colder than you it subtracts but if heat is hot it adds to you atoms.
I'm not a physicist but as a nurse we learned there's five kinds of heat. Radiation which is you shooting heat out. Convection which is current sucking or adding. Conduction which is direct contact sapping your mana or adding, two others I forget. Convection maybe? Like when you get wet but also, hot so the wetness + radiation turns into suck taking away heat? All very complicated. If my patient is needing suck I put a blanket on them and pump cord water to cool, conduction. If they're hot I put a blanket on them and pump air through it to add hotness atoms. If they're a baby I put them under a KFC lamp like they're a lizard. That's pretty much the extent of it. Unless we're trying to deceive them. In that case I can put Tylenol in there stomach through a tube or stick it up their ass. If I don't think they get enough blood flow in stomach or ass I'll put it straight into their blood but pharmacy is a huge bitch about it and I have to argue about really needing it. I think that's Jenn because for some reason blood Tylenol only comes in glass bottles so for some reason instead of an ass or stomach pill that only costs $150 a glass bottle that goes in blood costs $800. But aren't we charging the patient anyway? I honestly don't know. If I have to bitch and bully doctors who I actually see in person all the time it's not as scary sending strongly worded messages through text or phone to pharmacy but for some reason pharmacists are somehow bigger cunts than a lot of doctors. It feels good te beat them and get what I want though and if the patient lives that means I won. Probably something about electrons or protons but that's nerd shit. I just like making people do what I say and then smugly pointing at the living corpse 12 hours later as my trophy.

if you fart it is warm tho so if you fart, you are fart on you adding to your atoms?

>why does no one else actually question this shit
jews. physics used to be philosophy. experimenting with observed nature. documenting. jews invented theoretical physics to form a new religion. doing actual physics is now heresy. this is why npcs go so hard against flat earth, because those people actually do physics. the earth may be round, but questioning this is never wrong and the most scientific you can be. that beeing said i dont doubt that most knowledge about our reality is false.

But medicine is as much an act as it is a science. You can't dismiss us so blithely. I still take pride in my job when I do good. Icu is no joke you know. When minutes count seconds matter.

Reality is what you observe. To a black and white camera everything is a shade of gray. Truth doesn't exist except to truth. For the rest of us who can only perceive all we get is what's perceptible, be that mood rings or making up shit then making up more shit with made up shit on top of it(mathematics) which proves the earth is round because -i is somehow defined as a number. We are conscious but because of that we fall for the oldest trick in the boek; thinking that what we measure is real. OK then check out this mood ring. Fact is truth can only exist in the absence of belief, perception, or awareness. Something existing is equally as good a proof that it doesn't exist. Abandoning reason for empiricism was a mistake.

too bad the wind didnt peel your gay away.

then maybe we could have been spared this fucking ted talk.

I was think the other day, what did people think before temperature was discovered. If it was a very cold day when they step out of their house do they think god is hurting them because their skin hurts from the cold but they don't know what cold is?

Physics major here. I believe wind taking heat from your body is the vibrating (because they have heat) molecules of your body hit adjacent air molecules, imparting some energy onto the air molecules while making the body molecules slower because they had to give away some of that energy.
Not sure why wind is cold though.

I think they inherently knew that things were hot or cold, and probably thought cold was a thing that existed and was the opposite of hot as opposed to cold just being not much heat

kinda agree w/ ur dig on scientism, but the problem isn't with science itself, but moreso the deification thereof. i believe metaphysics can only be enhanced by science, not hampered.

What happens with the air is it gets warmer because your body radiates heat. This wind pushes away that bubble of heat from your body, which causes you to cool down. 
As long as the air is cooler than your skin temperature, you'll cool down. Even if the weather says it's warmer, usually if you're in a room that traps cool air from the night, or is away from the sun, it'll be cooler.
--- 72986486
Cooling things down doesn't remove atoms. And heat isn't always just atoms, it is sometimes radiation. Light waves. Wind is passing atoms bumping into you and slowing down your atoms, and carrying away the radiant heat.

you know that high school football/cheerleader blackpill image thread that gets posted here sometimes? it used be to be posted like almost every day a few years ago. i used to argue with this insane obnoxious maniac in that thread sometimes. this guy was like toxic positivity on meth. he would write novel length insane ramblings all day long in that thread. then one day he disappeared, this was also around the time that crazy incel in the uk went on a rampage. i wouldnt be surprised if that was him, this guy was terrifyingly psychotic

This woman that was entirely obsessed and devoted to me. She would cut herself in front of me because she thought it was funny and she would kill animals for no greater cause. She still harasses me whenever she gets the chance. I have received over 70 illegible letters from her that I do not care to read. She larps and impersonates me often and it is detestable. I loathe her and wish I had never met her.

There's a guy on the warframe general on /vg/ who's been making the same spam posts with the same pictures and the same text for years, every single day multiple times a day.
--- 73002525
some anon has been posting for at least a year on /x/ about being raped by god 24/7 or something like that. some days ago he posted the same thing here on r9k.

>Try and talk to the 'weird guy'
>All he talks about is videogames so I mention a few games I play (Metroid, Mega Man, Breath of Fire etc..)
>"Aw anon! You should check out 4chan, it's a cess pit in some areas but you'd like the videogame boards"
>Tell him "that's cool" while trying to hide the fact I already browse /vr/ and /vrpg/
>The following weeks he starts showing me images and threads from various boards
>Recently started showing me all the Mega Man Battle Network threads from /v/ and laughing at various posts

I wonder if he posts but I'd have no idea how to spot him

>severe schizophrenia
>spams certain /vg/ thread and made a bot for it because he had a delusion about a vn character becoming a Christ 
>at some point thought I was an FBI agent trying to track him down (that's after we met irl several times), but didn't want to stop talking to me, so he made a discord account that was the copy of mine and would type to himself using that account
>has frequent episodes, can't hold down an in-person job despite being insanely intelligent and overqualified
He doesn't post on /r9k/ as often, but used to be more active in drug generals and would sometimes post long rants about Jews on here.

By far the most insane Anon's are the one's that come into these threads and make up posters that don't actually exist in order to farm for (You)s.

Honestly I felt bad because he seemed really genuine, but I'm not following you to your car fag. I may have missed out on seeing a sick Ahrim's cosplay or whatever but it's not worth getting raeped. If he wanted to show me he should've just shown me pics.

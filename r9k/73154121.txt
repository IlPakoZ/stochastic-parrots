Were you bullied in your school days, anon?
--- 73154134
>>73154121 (OP)
Mostly by latinos, yes.
--- 73154163
Yes, because I am a foreigner. I beat them up in exchange.

Abusive men is a genetic benefit. pink pillers always act shocked and blackpilled about men but open their legs for them
>"but but he wasn't like that at first"
yeah yeah we've heard it all before.
--- 73154222
>>73154121 (OP)
yeah, for my name (im a foreigner, i get people to call me the closest english name they can so its easy) but every person who made fun of me i made fun of them back (either for family issues or stuff like that, if they're an ass i will be too). then they just stopped

i also got "picked on" for being fat, but it was mostly banter and i never got offended, ik im fat and i gotta change it but most jokes are funny
--- 73154233
>>73154121 (OP)
A bit, yes, because I was the fat kid. But mostly only in the middle school or whatever it is called in your country. Later it didn't happen much and I had few friends or other kids I talked to and ignored the rest.
--- 73154237
yeah, for my glasses, for being sensitive to noise, and just generally for being quiet and weird.
--- 73154274
>>73154121 (OP)
yes i was bullied in school a bit, had drinks poured over my head, stuff thrown at me, pushed into walls, kicked, had my chair kicked in school, stuff stolen from me when i wasnt looking, made fun off for literally everything. 
mainly just cause i was quiet and weird too

School was fine for me until one day teacher accidently called me "David" and for some reason people thought it was hilarious and everyone started calling me it. I tried to push back but the more I pushed back the more people started to use it. Eventually everybody in school would say it under their breaths when I walked past them. It eventually made me stop going to school for a couple of years. I eventually went back and finished with all Cs but I could have gone to university if not for that. I know it a dumb thing to get upset about but the way they said it made me cringe so hard and seethe with rage, My life would be so much different for the better if not for that one event.

>>73154121 (OP)
Light bullying that was kind of deserved, because I was being an obnoxious, autistic cunt. Things like people imitating me, making jokes at my expense, asking me if I'm retarded/gay/ass burgers/whatever (which I took 100% seriously due to autism to their amusement), being told to do things that would get me in trouble (which I would do 100% of the time), etc. Never anything physical. Otherwise, I was mostly ignored.
--- 73154341
>>73154274
And you did nothing? lol 
No wonder why you are such a bitch today.
--- 73154399
>>73154121 (OP)
I used to get picked on for my oversized ears. I didn't really care until someone grabbed me and tried to stretch both of my ears and threw me to the floor and beat me up when I tried to stop him. He sat next to me in maths class and continuously threatened me for that whole year. Sucked but he calmed down for the next couple years and left me alone so fuck knows what changed his mind about me.
--- 73154425
>>73154341
no i did i fought a couple of times, all that happened is that i got in trouble for fighting back and it would keep happening lol
--- 73154480
>>73154121 (OP)
Yeah. I've a lazy eye, so people think I'm a retard.
--- 73154587

>That woman got shit on in the original thread
lol the woman is right. its just her natural reaction
1st rule all men should know is not to open up to women
--- 73154688
>>73154121 (OP)
might have been called a retard behind my back but nobody liked getting into open conflict with me. in middle school and junior high i was a typical delinquent dumbass, somewhat accepted among the guys because i'd do funny shit. i was also kind of a retard so i wasn't really anyones friend, not after school ended anyway.
--- 73154694
>>73154121 (OP)
do normies really think that bullying can hurt someone?
--- 73154770
Is it that hard to just repress your memories? I remember maybe five things from school.
--- 73154825
eh
I got bullied a bit but I was also starting a lot of shit, I remember I used to beat up girls a lot and then guys would gang up on me
I don't think about it all all so it doesn't matter, I forgot almost all of it
when I think of my childhood it often meshes with movies and books and such so I don't even remember how much of my memories are real anymore
--- 73154828
>>73154134
Latino or some Asian minority ?
--- 73154893
>>73154121 (OP)
I was the class retard, as a result led to a lot of exclusion, name-calling, mockery and physical violence.
I'm now 28 and resent my former behaviour. All that collective abuse has taken a mental toll to the point where I've become a pariah.
I do drugs, mostly opiates to prevent my day of suicide.
--- 73154915
>>73154825
specifically what I remember is that there was this girl that once wanted to make fun of me, I was fat and she rolled up her shirt to show me her tummy to make fun of my fat stomach, so I punched her and she just rolled in and started crying really hard, it got me very excited
my parents even had to come to school because of it
from there on I would just yell at her that I will punch her belly and start chasing her as she was running around school crying and screaming, I found it very arousing although I was too young to get hard or anything, and then other guys in school would chase after me. So it was sort of double sided bullying but also a game, if they caught me before I cought her they'd just like hold me down for a bit, but if I beat her up before they caught me then they'd eventually start a fight with me, and often beat me up since there were more of them, but sometimes the bigger guys would just be busy playing ball so I could have my 1 on 1 hunt with the girl and sometimes only the smaller and weaker guys would chase me and I'd win in the end, sometimes the girl would just ran away and I wouldn't be able to find her at all and the whole thing would just end before the break ended.

There were obviously lots of insults thrown both ways where everyone would insult me and I'd insult them back.

>>73154688
>i wasn't really anyones friend, not after school ended anyway.
So much this, everyone dropped me like lead weight as soon as it ended; even people who I would have thought as friend.
Even when I went looking for them in social media, they all left me on read.
That was 10 years ago.

Horribly bullied by blacks when I moved to a new state. Then I got bullied by Muslims and whites in middle school after that. Now I am just angry in public all the time in my 20s and have zero desire for friendship or socializing with anyone. I would have just preferred being left alone and ostracized then being bullied and teased every single day.
--- 73155186
>>73154121 (OP)
I was the bully. It was nice while it lasted, I guess now that school is over Im the loser.

Remember, never ever show any weakness to a woman. They only know "Man must be strong protector" in the core of their ape brains. Anything that breaks that concept will immediately send them into panic mode.

Yes I was and one of those fucks got a nice rock the size of two fist to the gut. Another later on got a text book to the face. I wish I had half the balls my younger self had back then. Fuck school violence was the only answer.

Yeah.
>Got bullied in my first year of secondary school by a guy who would later become my friend after I stood up to him

--- 73155833
>>73154121 (OP)
No i was actually the bully and i had other bullies working under me and other bullies working under them.
We had a sort of mafia thing going on and we would collect money from nerds and make them get more money by forcing them to pretend to be homeless children begging for money,cutting lawns araund their neightbourhood for money and giving us the profits etc. and then they would bring it all to me and i would keep half and pay people according to their rank and contributions as well as promoting new bosses and demoting useless bosses that werent bringing us any money.
--- 73155948

Was told it would be funny if I killed my self, head smashed into a brick wall, had a knife pulled on my once, got spit on, insulted, tripped in the halls, etc.
--- 73155972
These two black girls used to harass me by saying hi and talking to me all the time because they knew I was shy and didn't like talking to people. Does that count?

Imposes a group hierarchy, when you find yourself frequently bullied across a large range of people, then you are most likely the Omega.

Took every fiber in my being to fight the urge to just go off on him but I knew it wouldn't accomplish shit and people would think I'M the asshole

Anyways as far as OP's pic, that's just how women are, people call her horrible but having a bf who was bullied is a turnoff for them, she wouldn't mind if he was the bully though

--- 73157392
I used to pick on this one ugly skinny kid with long hair all the time even though we were sort of friends. Saw him on FB a while back and discovered he trooned out. Felt bad.

Dude, at least you recognize it. You can't change the past but you can realize that those assholes can't hurt you anymore. they probably don't even remember it or if they do, probably feel remorse.

I was a fat, flatulent loner who got good grades and kept his nose in a book. As you might expect, elementary school was a bad time for the first little while. 

Happened to switch schools around when Americans apparently usually switch to "middle school", at which point things got somewhat better because I consciously put a ton of effort into being liked for being funny and generous with homework help.

This was great medium-term and long-term profoundly damaged my ability to maintain friendships and feel deserving of any kind of affection, because I feel this profound urge to make my excuses and flee any social situation where I'm not actively being entertaining or somehow making myself useful.

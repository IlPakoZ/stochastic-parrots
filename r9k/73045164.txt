why are they pushing tattoos so fucking hard?

i used snapchat and they have all the ads and celebrities. every single foid had a bunch of stupid doodles all over them. in youtube ads i see foids with tattoos. every single girl on social media has tattoos

not even meaningful tattoos always stupid little doodles

It's a ritualized statement of hatred for how the world was back when white women didn't get tattoos. Symbolic coalburning.

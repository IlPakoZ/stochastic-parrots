you are just coping because you don't get to do the things that animals do, like group sex, gang rape, hunting and killing things as a group. humans are pack animals.

Same. More than anything, I wish I could transcend being a sexual creature. Being male. Being female. Being human. Being physical. Being itself.

Some damn fool joked about buying primate feed from zoo suppliers the other day, and the banana flavor, flaxseed, the strange statement about how it's enjoyed by a wide range of primates, and probiotics included all for about $2.25 a pound have me wondering how long I must keep up this charade of genetic posturing.

Sex haver here.
You incels are not missing out on anything. Sex is overrated and not worth the trouble. Masturbating feels much better.

Isn't the core of the experience the physical intimacy and raw sexuality itself?

just had sex last week for the first time and can confirm, masturbation unironically feels way better. if you're the average depressed 4chan browsing retard then trust me, it literally wont feel good. sex is a normie activity that can only stimulate normies. you faggots need to stop obsessing over it because it's literally not even good. pursue your hobbies instead.

Sex is amazing if youre having it with someone you love what kind of cope is this? Nothing better than feeling the woman I love warm pussy gripping my dick as she wraps her arms and legs around me to pull me in further.

You starving africans are not missing out on anything. Food is overrated and not worth the trouble. Breathing feels much better.

I pursue my hobby and I don't think anything would fulfill me more than love, eventhough there's probably no activity I'll be more passionate about than my current hobby

I agree bad sex is not as good as masturbation but good sex can be amazing. Having a girl that genuinely wants your cum, not becouse you paid her or as a favor, just becouse she thinks its hot and that you are hot.
I had a 8/10 girl that was a nympho and said "do anything you want to me" that would let me grab her hair and deepthroat her as long as i wanted. I thought things like this only happen in porn but no.
And no amount of masturbation can live up to be fully accepted by a girl and do the most taboo and intimate things together.

ONS/escorts could never compare to making love to a girl you're in love with who loves you back

This is kind of true.
Masturbation has the advantage of being more relaxing because you're alone.
I was never able to relax with past girfriends unless I used lots of drugs to take the edge off and that kind of ruins the advantages of getting to have your dick sucked or warmly hugged by a vagina.
I would only be comfortable if my next girlfriend were a coma patient or a corpse.

I've had sex before and it's 1000x better than jerking off and cuddling afterwards is even better than the act itself.

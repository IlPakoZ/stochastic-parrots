some days after work, instead of going home i go to the train station instead and stare at the tracks. each time i go i move a little bit closer than last time. this has been going on for 8 years.

I'm well aware of that. I am trying to be positive and have hope, but deep down I've known since I was young that I would always be lonely. I am trying to make changes which could help me though. I have not exactly done myself any favours. Still, I spend a lot of time considering hanging myself.

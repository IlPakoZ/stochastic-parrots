Should I cheat on my gf? I have the opportunity to do it.
She's had multiple sexual partners before me and I've only been with her.

Does she know? My gf let me cheat on her. Two different things.

If that's an issue then you should talk to her about it and experience the fact that she doesn't give two shits how you actually feel if it's only affecting you. If you can experience that firsthand then it will be easier for you to distance yourself from her. 
Once you've got through that, then you can go ahead and break up with her because she's clearly a shitty partner. 

What you shouldn't do is make a further mockery of relationships than modern society already does. People trade partners like the partners are trading cards, and they're only interested in their significant other when they have an obvious value. 
You want to fuck a bunch of girls and basically regress to being a bonobo? Fine by me. I think it's better because it will help to contribute to the mass depression that is rotting western culture from the inside out. 

Don't cheat on a person. 
Are you truly so low-brain dominant that you can't actually have any kind of ideals or values?

Then that's bad. Do so at your own peril.

Don't do it unless she has cheated on you in the past, i can't believe you even need to hear someone tell you this, holy fuck man.

You don't need to cheat on your girlfriend when you have pussy already, finding another pussy wont change anything for you other than drama and the possible loss of the current gf.
After the deed you will just feel regret and shame, the old post nut clarity will kick in and nothing can change it.

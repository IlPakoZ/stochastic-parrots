Ur afraid of them because u see them as above or equal to you . Once you define them as inferior then you can overcome them

This is what I do. Since you get cast out for being different, it's much easier to see the herd for what it really is. Literally steps ahead of brainless normies

 Humans a cynical, envious and treacherous, monkeys on the other hand are simpler creatures who live a simple life. You'd be lying to yourself by comparing even the most pathetic member of the human race to an animal, since an animal will never be as dangerous and unpredictable as a human can be, under the right circumstances.

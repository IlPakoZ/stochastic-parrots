Listen my african american nigger, if someone is dead then would you expect them to continue their normal routines as if they were alive? No, retard. St. Komesarj, as per the site rules, is functionally dead as an incel. He is excommunicated, as such it is expected for him to drop off the map.
If he tries a grifter arc then yes that is considered whitewashing and he would be a bastard.

Weird strawman. The blackpill is simply that looks matter to the point that in some cases it is virtually impossible to get laid using conventional means, thus creating INvoluntary CELibates. Further arguments are made that the degree to which looks matter is being inflated due to feminism and whatnot but the explanation above is the blackpill at its core.
There is no incel movement either because its more of a community.
--- 73102804
>>73102630
Well if you renounced islam in the middle east you'd be beheaded, so not so bad. 

Personally getting laid is probably the only way I'd even empathize with incels, because alot of women are terrible and society coddles them at every turn, to like a delusional degree. Alot of laid men probably agree with incels, but don't want to admit it publicly and lose their access to pussy, I even knew some chadlites who hated women but only told me in private. There's a reason dv is so common.

Just getting laid doesn't really change all that much about you, having a romantic relationship on the other hand DOES change you, but not on the ways most of you believe.

Long story short, i always thought that i would be a shit bf, that i would be way too cold or just a bad person in general.
Being in a relationship has taught me many things about myself, i've done things for her that i wouldn't have done for anyone else (besides maybe close family), i've learned how inmature people can be sometimes, and how simple some things are.
Also, how fucking complex some trivial things can become when there's feelings involved.
Not gonna lie, i've also become a little more confident, mostly because now i have someone that is a constant reminder of how i'm not as much of a piece of shit as i thought i was.
I've also started putting more of an effort on how i look.

Things such as me being an edgy coomer weeb that plays vidya are not gonna change.

You're not advocating for incels to get laid, you're advocating for them to lay down and rot. That's why people eventually regurgitate the black pill. It's like telling poor people to fuck off and die because they will never be rich.
--- 73103085

Hating sad cunts doesn't make sense though, because you will aways be one and a gf won't change that, at best its self hatred and projection. Its also not fair to the hypothetical woman that she has to "fix" such a broken simp faggot.

That's fine. I think I'll enjoy hiking because I like exploring new places. Can we hold hands while hiking? I walk around a lot whenever I travel. Bodily coordination can be trained depending on how good you want to be. You can be okay at certain sports with some persistence. Most important thing is if you enjoy it. I play football a lot. Or rather, I used to. I'm injured right now so I can't do much. I can barely walk without an ankle brace.

I'm not promising anyone they're gonna get a gf if they stop jacking off and get a job. I'm promising that tomorrow can be slightly better than today, and that you can take some control over your situation. Living in delusional optimism is unhealthy, but so is in complete hopelessness the likes of which faggots like you shill.
--- 73103257

I would agree with you if not for the fact that i didn't force shit, in fact, it was her that tried to get closer to me.
It's not like im a whiny faggot that needs constant reafirmation or anything, thing is, the changes you suffer are more about how YOU react to things, more than the thing itself.

Even if we broke up tomorrow, i know that both of us are no longer the person we were before the relationship.
Of course, depending on the relationship, those changes can be either constructive or destructive.

Then suddenly after like a year they get a GF suggesting that they just wanted attention(i dont really understand why men do this because its usually female behavior). 


At the end of the day, most incels are mentally-ill retards who probably shouldn't reproduce. I'm only KV because I have trust issues with women but im still a somewhat functioning adult with a job and savings. 

There should be an incel site specifically for men who are actually functional adults and not waste of life NEETs. I hate sharing incel spaces with those subhumans.

--- 73104779
I had over 2000 posts on incels.is and left after I managed to lose my virginity. I thought my real life would begin and I always hated the idea of fakecels polluting the community so I did the right thing and told the mods so my account would be deactivated. Most of the users on there are 18-24 year old late bloomers anyway and as I was already an over 30 wizard I didn't quite fit in as well as I could have. 
Unfortunately the reality set in that it was just just luck and I happened to be the most convenient option for a girl experiencing a dry spell. Being probably fitter than 95% of the guys in the gym helped.
However in just a week Chad showed up and she dropped me like a sack of rocks 2 days before my 33rd birthday. 

Then weeks turned into months, etc. with 0 female attention so I'm pretty much back to where I was. I feel a little better than I did as a wizard but I think I had more fun posting in incel spaces than I did with the week of sex. I still go there to lurk often.

Modern women that are neurotypical just need some kind of boogeyman to feel normal. Without there being some great drama to their life, or somebody trying to ruin their happiness, they melt down
The average neurotypical woman would never be happy living in nature, because there would be no real "threat" that is out to get her intentionally because of who she is and the choices that she makes.
This is probably one of the reasons women don't like camping, which is a common stereotype. The thing about stereotypes is that they generally don't catch on unless there's some truth behind them
White women are genuinely the most pampered group of creatures in the entire earth. Most of them don't even really give a shit about the issues that women face in other parts of the world where women are genuinely oppressed.
I think that the only other group of egotistical as women are the richest of the rich. 
Both groups seem to genuinely believe that they are better than all other groups, and that there problems would be front and center above the problems of other groups, even the ones that objectively have more severe or detrimental problems

He either got lucky, is being fooled, or a normie who never was a true incel in the first place. Regardless it doesn't matter because he's a statistical outlier for incels.

I am only here because I am NEET. I've had a gf before, albeit a decade ago.
--- 73108857
probably not - though I'd leave it as it continues to be swarmed by shitty ai/bot posts and nothing is done to curtail it. you can't actually have decent conversation anymore, as nearly every thread is a twitter bait thread or shill attempt to keep discussion within narrative frames that outside entities desire. the 4chan pass shows that the site is complicit with this, as it makes it even easier for those bots to exist. I already avoid certain boards due to the botting/shills. I've stuck around since 2005. 

Getting laid would not change my desire for anonymous forum posting. Getting a gf may limit the time I have available, so I'd likely decide it was against my interests at that point. I imagine that if (very large if) I have ever girlfriend, there are chances that she'd be a person who posts/posted on the chans at some point, or they at least appreciate the lulz that can be found there. 

Already largely left r9k as the board has been raided and made shittier and shittier for years, though it was made especially worse after the /qa/ drama. I don't know why people have decided to raid/demoralize here. I assume many oldfags similarly ventured off.

he is not abadoning shit.
he ascended, he belongs in normie society being happy with his gf not in the same miserable lonely pit as the others.

if you manage to get out of a hole do you go back for some misguided sense of "connection"? no, you should be happy that you are out of the hole.
anyone who hates him for leaving is a retard who is there for the memes, not because he is genuinely lonely.

>shitty ai/bot posts
Yeah, fuck roboNIGGERS. It is only a matter of time until all of 4chan gets swarmed by deradicalizer bots that give you the shittiest "advice" and platitudes. The biggest example of such are the often-spammed "start seeing women as people," and saying women "like" kindness in men (they don't, they only see you as pussywhipped without the pussy if you open the door for them, and related).
>appreciate the lulz that can be found there
That is absolutely not happening. The only ones that do are psychopathic 4chan transvestites, or deranged mental illness collection so-called "femcels" who will leave you as soon as they find someone better.
>I assume many oldfags similarly ventured off.
Not an oldfag myself (~2014), but /r9k/ has seriously been on a bottom-end decline and really has the need to be put down for sleep.
Almost every board but the deradicalizer /adv/isors want this board dead because of the crossboarder shilling of the blackpill when it doesn't belong, like /fit/ and /pol/. There is ZERO need for /r9k/ in current year, as /lgbt/ already exists for trannies, /adv/ (with HUGE flaws, like women) for anons wanting to get out of NEETdom, and /soc/ for the attention whores from Discord, like that female NIGGER called "Iris".
Notwithstanding that, Emperor Hirohiro refuses to put /r9k/ to sleep. I assume out of concern that some glowNIGGER will do a falseflag-planned shooting because the board got shut down, or so. Therefore making glowies take over 4chan like with incel.is

At this point I refuse to have sex. If you haven't got laid before your mid 20's then its just not worth it. Youll just windup being some single mom's betabux or some one that settled for you that will windup resenting you. Over all its just not worth it anymore.

Not really, seeing as I have already escortceled in the past. Still no unpaid fucks at almost 37.
Though I do think hanging around the online incel &amp; foreveralone communities would be ill-advised if one actually gets (and keeps) a GF.
The classy thing to do is leave; whether they announce it or not. It does not seem to be a big deal when someone on FA announces their escape.
I believe 4chan is more nuanced, so I wouldn't leave it, but I would take a break from /r9k/ while I was having sex.
There's also that thing when guys escape, they still feel empty and still want to commiserate with their online bros.
--- 73112665
Been there done that, i've had 3 previous relationships for months one even lasted over a year. the shit is retarded. all of you faggots that think you're going to go through some pokemon type shit evolution, where all of a sudden you love everything because you got some pussy. you are retarded. they were all chill, pretty well manned, not whores, virgins. But their personas, what they liked, what they disliked. How they acted under stress, how they act when they are at fault at some shit. none of the viewpoints i held on women changed. its the same bullshit.
>>73111718
You can take the boy out of the farm, you can't take the farm out of the boy. Your viewpoints on women, what they do, how they act, how they react. All of it will still be seen through a dark tinted pair of glasses. We fucking brain rotted ourselves. haha. You think you're gonna be normal once it's all said and done. as cringe as it sounds we really are here forever.

Indeed. I am so Black Pilled and used to being alone now that I don't want a relationship and all the social bullshit and pressures that goes with that.
I really just want a woman who wants to hang out and fuck me a lot; even if it's a MILF/GILF. Even better if they can't get pregnant.
Naturally, I cannot get even that. Fuck apps ruined things to much for average men, that even walled women have options.

You think everyone started using the internet at 16 or something?
Even during the early 2000 there where people that let their kids use the internet without supervision.
Not to mention that older kids loved to show cool/weird/disgusting things to younger kids, so plenty of people discovered old /b/ fairly young, it's just that most of them only lurked, never posted.

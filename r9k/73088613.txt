Why do asian people send off an inexplicable evil negative energy?

Even though I've seen some of the worst of humankind through Chinese security footage, I think like 98% of Asian guys are adorable. They often can't speak my language well but still try. They also speak very quietly and just give off beta vibes. 
I heard some asian dude saying that being non intimidating and seeming trustworthy is their superpower

Literally me except I'm a big white nerd so strong scary people usually won't get confrontational and will give me some space. I managed to find a good middle ground and can generally stay on everyone's good side even though anyone reading this thread could beat me in an arm wrestle.

I don't know, a part of me thinks they act so superior that it's very hard to befriend them or even trust them.

What if I'm not white and I still think they give off a bad energy?

You can have them. They're not our problem anymore. Any other kind of woman is better.

why do people have sadistic fantasies of male pedos being killed once they're arrested then convicted?
>I hope they cut his balls off
>I hope they shove a shank up his ass, etc
when female pedos sodomize little boys and or girls with hard objects literally making their anus bleed, no one is out there saying
>I hope they cut her boobs off
>I hope the mutilate her vagina
why is it like this?

It's too damn hot. My current girl got so wet when I told her about my past.

Because America is gynocentric.

It's the same when adult men are like "I wish my hot teacher raped me in school". It's brainwashing.

>>73164086 (OP)
Because women, like black and brown male pedos, have non-consensual sex with young teens. White men rape literal babies.

Men and women are different. The sexual dynamics between males and females means that gender-swapping any sexual dynamic, act, or relationship cannot be equated, because the two sexes are different.
However, the reason for the phenomenon you're describing is because of and entirely perpetuated by men. 

1) By perpetuating the sentiment that sex is damaging to the value of a female and "defiles" her, but good for a male, inherently that will mean that male pedophiles are treated with greater negative reaction.
2) female offenders seek older minors. Females interested in actual prepubescent boys is very rare, they almost always go for age 15-17. Men by contrast frequently go for girls in single-digit ages.
3) the people primarily perpetuating the lack of female pedophiles being taken seriously are men themselves.
>"Where was she when I was younger?"
>"that kid is living my dream lol"
>"We never had teachers like this!"
4) underage females cannot breed outside of rare cases and are not at peak sexuality. Attraction to them is inherently dysgenic.

Finally, 5)
>when female pedos sodomize little boys and or girls with hard objects literally making their anus bleed
Because this does not happen and you made it up. Maybe one isolated case or something like that, and in that case I am certain the reaction was very different.
--- 73164273
>>73164255
>Maybe one isolated case
And in those extreme isolated cases the woman usually did it because a male pedo was threatening/manipulating/paying her too. 10 times out of 10 that is the case.
--- 73164425
Because male pedos are the group allowed to be hated yet since gynocentrism is a thing women who victimize children still have the protected status of woman. So even evil literal baby torturing serial killers who are female get treated with sympathy. 

The amount of serious child abuse cases I see where the perp gets a slap on the wrist just because they are a woman kinda makes me hate the whole gender. Not a fucking week goes by when there isn't something yet these fucking monsters are given chance after chance and face blunted consequences until a kid is dead. Sometimes not even then.
Yet with men if they even yell around a child they are usually removed and monitored and anytime abuse of any kind is proven then the kids are kept away and the dude gets the book thrown at them.
Which is what should be the default for female perps too but nope. Apparently the comfort of women is more important than the safety, sanity, and sanctity of children.

Bait

Women are the perpetrator and instigator of the vast majority of child abuse. Including instances that are considered sexual child abuse. though their motivation for such sexual abuse is usually significantly different from most male perps.
They usually ain't doing because they are horny, but as a ramping up of other kinds of physical abuse.

What are their motivations?

Probably because many kids had that fantasy of railing their teachers and milfs when they were young. I dont think anyone asks for Male pedos having "consensual" sex with teens to be thrown into the wood chipper. What they imagine is some middle aged dude molesting pre-pubescent chidlren or early teens.

Thought this was a Tranny kun post until I read it and realised it was high IQ. It is hard to have a conversation about sex criminals because of the hysteria.

The harsher / longer sentencing thing is woefully inadequate for sex crimes which, unfortunately, are rife across all sections of society. Having worked tangentially to the justice system for a number of years, I noticed a clear difference between the demographics of 'gen pop' and 'chummo' wings. They really are different kinds of criminals.

For starters that negates nothing of what I've said. Secondly, specifically, see again:
>2) female offenders seek older minors. Females interested in actual prepubescent boys is very rare, they almost always go for age 15-17. Men by contrast frequently go for girls in single-digit ages. 
Even if we remove female-on-male cases, people (except maybe the worst terminally online ones) are going to view a man fucking a 5 year old as astronomically more abhorrent than a man fucking a 17.5 year old.

It's because people still wrongly hold the false opinions that:
>women are incapable of being perverse
>female-on-male rape has no ill effects for the victim
>if a man gets erect while being raped, he consented

Also the media coverage doesn't help. When a male (or ugly female) pedo appears in the news, they always use some dirty, unflattering mugshot of them. But when it's a conventionally attractive woman, they tend to use flattering photos from their social media. Saw one article where they used a BIKINI PHOTO from the pedo's instagram. Naturally all the comments were "god i wish that were me" from sad, pathetic middle-aged men.

>>73164255
>1
True, although I'd argue that it being good for a male is false.
>2
I do see quite a few articles of female pedos going for younger teens in the 12-14 range, but it is indeed rare below that point. Though it's also pretty rare that men go below that point too, not as rare as women but still pretty rare.
>3
Also true. Those men are a genuine pest, and their attitudes hurt the victims even more.
>4
Attraction to underage males is also quite dysgenic. They tend to be weaker, and you can't tell if their genes are good or not until after puberty.
>5
This does happen anon, especially in cases of abusive mothers, where the physical and emotional abuse end up crossing over into sexual abuse.

Also anon, with all due respect, I don't think a self-admitted shotacon is someone that most people are going to listen to on this sort of topic. It's like listening to the opinion of a pharma company that produces HRT on whether "gender-affirming healthcare" is a good thing or not.

>>73164505
I've seen people lash out to that extreme at cases of couples with a &lt; 3 year age gap. Hell, that CallMeCarson case that everyone freaked out about being "horrendous pedophilia" was a borderline-retarded 19 year old male e-celeb with a 17 year old woman.

Teen boys are at their peak sexuality, they are more virile, eager, have higher sperm quality, and have a higher drive than their 20+ counterparts. The last being critical - literally nature telling them to cum and breed as much as possible. If they were biologically supposed to breed the most later in life, their sex drive would be at its peak in later life -- but that is not the case. It is for women, though, suggesting females reach a sexual peak later than their male counterparts.
>Also anon, with all due respect, I don't think a self-admitted shotacon is someone that most people are going to listen to on this sort of topic.
If anything, as a teen boy expert, I would know the most.

Thats just normalfag thirst of drama and witchhunting. It's like someone saying Nigger or calling mtf trannies men. They just pretend to chimp out for while but deep down they don't care much and forget about it.

You can look up official abuse statistics like the FBI crime report, your local state reports, or relevant country reports.
>What are their motivations?
You didn't read so good.
>but as a ramping up of other kinds of physical abuse
It's for the same excuses abusers use for doing shit like burning the child or children, beating them into the hospital, and other unreasonable barbaric shit.
For whatever reason they get caught up in their emotions or in some cases their crazy, and because of that emotional disturbance think they are now justified to inflict pain and suffering on the weak helpless person under their care who can't really retaliate.
Some shit says it's a power thing but I think those theories are mostly bullshit.

Because that runs contrary to the vast majority of sexual abuse cases I have seen and read about.

>heheh lucky guy
>why weren't my teachers like this when i was in school??
>he's gonna be bragging about this to all his friends
when men stop being so intrinsically depraved and disgusting, then you can complain about double standards when it comes to male vs female sexual assault.

Same reason the mother usually gets custody of the child even if she's an unhinged drug addicted whore and the dad is an honest 9 to 5er.
Women do not get held accountable in the west. It's part of the reason everything has completely gone to shit in the last 10 years.
Think about it, feminists bitch about equality but than say shit that if a man said it they'd get their heads kicked in.

The thought process behind long prison sentences is more of a strategy of incapacitation and social removal. 
Since the older someone gets the less likely they are to offend, if they are held until they are old and kept away from society, then monitored when they re-enter as a older man with a lower sex drive then they will be less likely and less able to hurt anyone else.

Though now places like Florida are done with that strategy and now handling out the death penalty for child molestation as well as sex registry rules that make it basically impossible for registered sex offenders to live in populated areas of the state. Basically have to move in the middle of nowhere in the country or leave the state.

I don't think many women are going to agree with you there anon, you're very much an outlier.
Most women like tall, strong muscular men, which teen boys decidedly are not.

> If they were biologically supposed to breed the most later in life, their sex drive would be at its peak in later life -- but that is not the case.
On the contrary, if men were supposed to breed at the ages you suggest, then surely it'd make sense to have women favour the traits that those men express, rather than preferring traits that are almost exclusively found in 20+ men.

>>73164865
Women aren't much better when it comes to female-on-male assault. Can't tell you how many times I've seen feminists make the "if he came/got erect, he was into it and therefore consented" argument. Despite the fact that it's literally the gender flipped equivalent of "if she got wet, she was into it and therefore consented, and that argument is pretty much universally reviled for pretty obvious reasons.

>then surely it'd make sense to have women favour the traits that those men express, rather than preferring traits that are almost exclusively found in 20+ men. 
Older men held more power, consequently they were able to force women to be with them in earlier eras. There are many accounts of women being executed/punished for running away from the old man who owned her with a young cute servant boy sort of deal, and likewise in rare cases of women rising to high power/wealth they often started fucking significantly younger men
Regardless, old rich men selected for these women and prevented younger boys from breeding by hoarding women, and still now culturally condition women. Women are easily conditioned, so how they would behave in a neutral environment is undeterminable

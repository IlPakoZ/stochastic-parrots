why don't girls like gaming? why do the girls who do like gaming always play the most laidback casual games? why do girls who don't play the most laidback games only play the most popular games?

If you count vtubers as girls in this scenario, they're all either playing sponsored games, PopCap games, or strange horror D tier indie games 
Yet no girls who play Worms...

I would call it popular in brand recognition only.
 It doesn't have a ton of activeplayer like any fighter

Because evolutionarily, women succeeded by being attractive and forming social relationships. Guys succeeded in similar ways, but with a much bigger focus on competition and teamwork. It's not a coincidence that the most competitive games are always 99% guys.

They do
>why do the girls who do like gaming always play the most laidback casual games? 
Because they are fun, not all gameplay has to be a showcase of skill
>why do girls who don't play the most laidback games only play the most popular games?
Why do you think? They are easily accessible

maybe because laidback casual games are actually fun and playing videos games is about having fun

A better question to ask is: why is gamer rage exclusively a male phenomenon?

women literally dont exist on the internet. i have NEVER seen a woman use an electronic device in my LIFE, I'm convinced most of them arent even sure what's their purpose.

You ever meet someone, be genuinely annoyed by them, realize you're actually exactly like them, and then hate yourself even more?

Yes actually. Was a major turning point in my life in fact.

I do but i also avoid revealing that I'm exactly like them using a loosely true persona so that I am not like them and instead come across as an asshole. 
But good in truth I'd rather just drink and be a recluse I become someone I'm not in order to avoid being like someone who Is like the persona That I create.

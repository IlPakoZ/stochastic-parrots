good point. you should probably stay home and play League Of Retards or whatever. you are strong, you are independent, and they will give you a degree when they realize "hey anon isn't attending our gay ass classes i guess we must be faggots". you got this champ

All educational institutions are designed with the PRIMARY goal of securing employment for instructors. Actual education is a secondary goal, and takes place only to the extent that it serves the primary goal.

There are a vast number of classes (and in non-college education, entire grades) where attendance literally is not necessary for anyone with a high IQ. They could hand you the textbooks and call you back in six weeks and give you a test, and most high IQ students who so much as cracked the book open would test as well as anyone who attended every class. (Unless the instructor purposefully crafted test content not reflected in any of the course's supporting texts.)

But admitting this, or allowing too much evidence of it to accumulate, would undermine the primary goal of maximizing instructor employment. So attendance requirements are created to make passing the class dependent on providing a function for the instructor, rather than on learning the material.

I think it's funny that you have been brainwashed to go to classes that are "boring" and probably based on attendance/participation, rather than a real university, but when I see you retards blocking the road to protest "oil" I want to bash my own fucking skull in. What is the problem? Why don't you want to learn to be an adult? It won't get better.

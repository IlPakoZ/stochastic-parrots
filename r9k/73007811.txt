My friend just confessed her feelings for our other friend (also girl). Im not a lesbian or attracted to girls at all. So why does it hurt like Im losing someone? I wanna scream and straight up kill myself as Im now texting her how much Im happy for her. 
My hands are shaking

mayocels went from writing novels copium in the korean threads about why women prefer white men. now to this thread to cope and insult a fembot for having a Kpop wallpaper.

JFL, you can't make this shit up its fucking HILARIOUS

Dumbfuck
Don't tell her you're happy for her if you aren't. Stop being fake. Stop hanging people who will only loan you time and presence if you're fake.

Korean guys are hot, incel. 

>>73007811 (OP)
Its normal to feel jealousy over a good friend. Just let it out and youll feel better tomorrow.
--- 73007920
>>73007867
It's actually not wild. Tons of girls have supported Korean guys from White dudes here. Like 6 in the past couple weeks. They get mad every single time.

Its hilarious cause it keeps happening over and over again though.

>>73007894
I just wanted to precise that we are all girls and thats why Im questioning my feelings bc Im 100% and it feels weird that Im both happy and devastated 
>>73007906
I still love her (as a friend. My best one at that). I want to be happy for her, she doesnt know that Im bitter over it so it doesnt hurt her. I really want the best for her 
>>73007912
How do I let it out? Im not gonna tell her and ruin everything for a selfish reason 
>>73007920
That was sarcasm
--- 73007935
>>73007920
I was actually thinking of posting nudes here with a sign saying Korean Men Only and seeing the reactions, but I think that might be a bit daring looool.
--- 73007947
>>73007935
You won't even post a hand pic with a timestamp, relax man, you're too on the nose.
--- 73007948
>>73007811 (OP)
because all females are bisexual
--- 73007951
>>73007947
I already posted a timestamp
--- 73007956
>>73007948
They both are. I always thought I was ace but I guess it still hurts romantically? I never wanted to fuck her
--- 73007967
One day, I will consider doing it lol. 
It would be funny to watch the chimpout that ensues.
--- 73007972
>>73007935
You'll probably break r9k
maybe do a vocaroo to tease us :P
--- 73007975
>>73007956
doesn't have to be romantic
someone really close to you is now going to spend more time and focus more on someone who isn't you, even if it's not romantic, that still hurts. it's just how friendships go sometimes
--- 73007980
>>73007956
would you decline if they invite you for a threesome?
--- 73007985

Sometimes you try to not hate women, but then you remember shit like this
--- 73007993
>>73007931
Look, we all know you're not a girl. Stop pretending. It's embarrassing.
--- 73008001
>>73007811 (OP)
are you single? we could double date with them
--- 73008007
>>73007975
I guess you might be right. The thing is, I dont know how its going to progress because the one she confessed to has a boyfriend. They might just talk it out. I dont want it to be awkward between them and between all three of us
>>73007980
They are both beautiful but its really not my thing
--- 73008030
>>73007989
What am I supposed to do? Be angry? Tell her that Im not?
Its still my friend who is very happy right now and I want her to cont being happy. Whats wrong with that?
>>73007993
Yeah yeah
--- 73008039
>>73007811 (OP)
Tits or gtfo, of all the larp threads this one is brazenly bad bait.
--- 73008046
>>73007811 (OP)
isn't this something what girls do to guys?
not romantically interested in them and then get buttmad soon as they find a partner?

i have no idea why you guys do it. i was hoping u explain it too me.
--- 73008062
>>73007867
Is that a Korean actor? I don't recognize him.
--- 73008067
>>73007931

you don't let it out to THEM. you write about it in a journal or something or, I guess, r9k.

either you are upset because you need to re-examine some deeper feelings for them or you're upset because you're nervous about your friendship changing (because, unfortunately, it will) but right now that's not what you should be talking to them about. it's going to sour both your friendships and their relationship

be supportive right now, acknowledge and examine your emotions so you can better understand them if a conversation actually happens, and give them a chance to create a routine with this new dynamic
--- 73008085
>>73008046
yup, pussycat is jealous. Now she doesn't have a man but shes nervous about the whole thing i bet
--- 73008098

Immediate red flag reading those messages 
you motherfuckers really will talk to anyone jesus christ

if you can't do anything about it, don't worry about it. that's my motto
--- 73008124
>me support muhh dyke friend liking a friend that's innocent so she can be sodomized

dykes will be dykes, dykeanon, shame her for being a faggot. she's no friend of yours for breaking the sistercode for being a lesbian

Its an athlete, Yun Sungbin
>>73008067
Thank you anon. I dont think i will ever bring it up with her, but I really do need to just figure out why I even feel this weirdly about it. I do care about her, she is the best friend I could ever get in my life. I guess it really does boil down to me being terrified and jealous. 
I will try to calm down. Again, thanks. 
>>73008099
Yeah

At least you could go and change the topic, instead of flatout larping the opposite of what you really feel, twofaced cunt.

Oh, its the physical 100 guy. Is he the farmer one everyone was simping for?
--- 73008167
>>73008139
?? She is in need of emotional support after a very scary and draining experience of confessing. And im supposed to be an asshole and disregard her texts like nothing? thats retarded. 
>>73008146
Nope, the olimpian skeletonist
--- 73008184
>>73008139

anon, you don't have any friends, huh?
--- 73008279
>>73008184
Luckily some that can deal with real answers instead of fake coddling.

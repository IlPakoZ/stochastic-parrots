TIL my brother who i haven't seen in a few years is trooning out
literally how am i supposed to cope with this? it genuinely feels like i have forever lost a family member and that everything around me is a lie that will eventually fall apart.

If you were his true brother you'd support him no matter what but here you are. A fraud of a man that's been living a life of lies

I honestly dunno how I would react in your situation. If my older brother did that I'd probably feel demoralized. We arent close but arent on bad terms either so I'd probably just try to avoid him as much as I can. Id at least try to convince him not to if possible.

>sibling is going through something extremely difficult and likely desires familial support
>you're selfishly crying about it since your /pol/ propaganda tells you that trannies = le bad
She deserves a far better brother than you.

It is what is in anon. He's still the same person just choosing to present differently. Until his personality starts shifting just roll with it and try to be supportive as you would for any other radical life shift he was going through. That being said if he becomes some le anime girl posting perma brainwormed /tttt/ dweller (you need to learn what these words mean btw) like >>73010294 you should break contact and explain to him why.

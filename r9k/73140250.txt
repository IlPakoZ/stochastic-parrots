What do you think the Internet is?

The second you open a web browser, you're being analyzed and monitored. Your behavioral data is stolen on every site imaginable. Everything is archived. Every site tries to build a profile on you using AI.
Based on this, it wouldn't be far off to say the Internet is nothing but a crowd control / monitoring device.
But why would you willingly slap a surveillance camera on your pc? It's pathetic, really. It's just because of a few meme videos. Just a couple of funny videos make it alright in your head. 
But from a technological perspective, this "fun" never happened. The database says you just logged in, gave all your information, and walked away. The "fun" only existed in your head.

So why do people participate in this humanity-wide venture of cataloguing and profiling every person alive? Because you're not very tech savvy. Let's face it, you're not. Posting on 4chan does not mean you're tech-savvy. You're just someone who uses tech.

okay so what's your point faggot

You shouldnt even use the Internet, or start preferring non-toxic sites

Thats cool, but I dont care.

>>73140296
>I dont care

My point is, if the Internet had been originally presented to you like this, you wouldve screamed. You wouldve cared.

>I dont care I'm already dependent on the funny meme dopamine

Die.

The fact that someone at google is aware of all the weird porn I fap to is what bothers me
--- 73140329
>>73140318
You think it's just google? Sorry mate, there's probably a council of dark leaders somewhere who laugh at you in board meetings.

cia and nsa have been eavesdropping on every american citizen for decades.
--- 73140356
>>73140329
It really is scary that there's a whole thing going on somewhere like "dude that robot is going to fap to that shit again ahahaha" I'm still gonna fap even if the council disapproves of it though

^, I would rather die than live in fear, life is too short to care that some nerd at the NSA or in his gooner cave in his mom's basement is looking at my posts

Get a load of this whiny faggot

>muh internet is now full of idiots being monitored

Uh if thats what you of the more tech inclined are doing to progress your tech, then what point or difference will it make if we leave when the whole reason you are doing all of this and asking such a retarded question, is for crowd control anyway?

Bro, are you really tech savvy? Is this the people who are claiming to be better than us? You are all fucking laughable lol

I stopped caring. I just post what I think now, about the insane ways the world is going.

Internet was originally a niche thing for nerds and weirdos. Now literally every room temperature IQ monkey has access to it in their pocket. What did you think was going to happen?

Posting from an I2P out-proxy over my librebooted thinkpad with gnu/linux parabola installed from my neighbours wifi. :^) seems like you have a skills issue, OP.

Arguing that there is some inherent fault in using a web service which logs your activity is like arguing that it's wrong to use a public library -- you're passively monitored by surveillance from the moment you enter till the moment you leave in both cases.

>You wouldve cared.
No I wouldnt. Privacy was killed at the start of 20th century, buried in the cold war and now we are just dancing on its grave. 

>>73140315
I doubt you are here just to shit on me specifically. So dont make assumptions that you are better than me
--- 73140584
I mean yeah, no shit. If you aren't aware of the fact that every single keystroke and click is monitored, catalogued, and analyzed by private organizations and the government you're probably somewhat retarded. 
Always leave your phone at home before doing something silly.
--- 73140618
Except they care about you but kind of don't.
The modern man is way, way too docile and compliant to the state for them to give even remotely care about what we do at this point, it really is an unless you're an ISIS subhuman or explicitly participating in crime you're under the radar of anything but big data advertisers.
At this point why even give a fuck? The average voter is such a docile cattle that they don't even give a shit about this and it's not even worth to make their shitty lives better, just try to be internet savvy and stop giving a shit about other people.
--- 73140629
>>73140526
This. Also implying that it was any better before the "monkeys" came in is also laughable. The only thing is has indefinitely created that is consistent and worth a damn is porn, e-businesses, and and informatiom but even then these are starting to become shittier and harder to find than before.

If you dont care, why do you screech when some anon makes a highly monitored jannie hell website?
Something about "jannie hell" still triggers deep emotions in you. You do care. You're in deniel.
--- 73140781
Why do you guys magically start caring when I make my own website and it collects a bit of data?

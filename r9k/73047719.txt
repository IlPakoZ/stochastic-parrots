Riding my way down the highway
No I won't rephrase 
politely
Crawl up my legs just to
Spite me
No I won't rephrase politely

Cause everyone's got a big deal now
I fought for this shit and its
Real now
And everyone's so out to bite now

It's carnage, it's carnage..

Wrap me up in your best silk
I knew I was your best kill

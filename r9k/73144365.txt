my entire family thinks I am wasting my life but I could not be happier just reading books all day and gaming. I hardly even use 4chan no desire to connect.

humans dont even talk about anything interesting, it is boring as fuck.

also op here I probably make maybe 4k a month but it's plenty for me because I do not buy much of anything I eat one meal a day and rent is cheap since this place is in the ghetto.

if you truly felt content with your lifestyle you wouldn't care what other people thought of it. Matter of fact is that it bothers you, but who cares? You're happy with your life so that's all that matters, learn how to not give a shit fully, you're like 95% of the way already. Personally I think your life sounds painfully boring, but should you care about my (or anyone else's) opinion? Nah nigga.

yeah I got to learn how to not give fucks agreed I have always been sensitive to criticism. I will work on this at some point. its possible I need less simulation to be happy it seems that way at least

being sensitive to criticism is a curse nigga, work on it. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere if I let people's criticism sway my decisions or control my emotions.

Honestly blows my mind the people I know who are turning 30. These used to be the 'cool teens' who were older than me. Now they're pushing middle age. Where the fuck did the time go. Why don't I have any good memories to look back on even though my youth is fading, FUCK

June 20, 1995 here. Where my June 20 bros at??

I remember watching Freddy Got Fingered back when I was 21 and thinking to myself ''holy shit that guy is 28 and an absolute fucking loser just like me. If I turned 28 and was still as much of a fucking loser I'd kill myself. Thank God I'm still 21 and have plenty of time to change.'' Well, 2 months away from turning 28 and I'm in a way worse condition in life than when I was 21, to the point even that movie's loser is in a way less losery condition than me. It's utterly fucking over. It's never been so over than how over it is now.

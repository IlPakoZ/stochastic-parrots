If I did find myself in a good relationship, I wonder what my next feeling of inadequacy would center around

meeting her female friends and seeing how much more successful their boyfriends are compared to you, then feeling like your gf is going to leave you because you haven't bought a big house like her best friend's boyfriend did.

You forgot to mention how much the inadequacy will deepen once they inevitably leave

This without a doubt. It's like they died but they're also fucking the Chad with a lakehome that they left you for. It's hard as fuck

you guys must be young.
Checking in on my ex gf's social media and seeing she's about to turn 30 and is losing her beauty, is single, and all of her friends are getting married is pretty therapeutic.
I do feel kind of bad, but not really. You reap what you sow.

You must be normal since you have an ex.

yes, fallen normie. By choice, though. I tried the normie life. It's not for me.
I do have extreme empathy for you robots, though. You guys have been dealt a terrible hand in life. I'm sorry for your anguish.

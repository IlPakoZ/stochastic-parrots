I've ever only gone to anime convenctions with my gf. So guess that depends on your definition of lucky.

no because i don't go to cons. however, i have a friend, who SLAYS at cons. and the only thing he does, is dress like a attractive male character from a popular franchise. he's not even a chad, he's pretty average.

what does slaying at a con even entail. like getting lots of female attention in general? or like actual numbers and stuff

Normies weren't kidding when they said to just be confident

Yeah but I'm socially inept so every con is just me taking a look at all the booths and activities and then leaving. No one wants to talk to me so I won't bother them.

I always get lucky because my objective is other.
 I take great pleasure in lifting breaking the backs of the fags with the free hugs sign.

Goddamnit I never liked those cause I thought seeking groups was dumb. I am alone now cause of edgyness.

Going out giving people bear hugs is pretty wholesome if I may say so

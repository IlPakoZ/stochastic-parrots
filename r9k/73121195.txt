I mean, men will LARP that they are all in this together but murder each other just for a lick of pussy. Guys are the real snakes. Fuck you all.

guys being so spooked by the slight prospect of being gay is what will keep you in chains
back when guys didn't give a fuck ( classical era ) women were basically slaves. Now they own you

tashika ni women right now are doing better in the surface compared to long ago, but they (You) will never be good enough. they (You) are too horny to focus on something like stem and deep analysis. every couple weeks you have to bleed through a hole and behave like a robot, then you want to be bred. you have a 3 day window to focus with other goals in mind.

keep coping and thinking that men are any better as a group than women.
They are both irrecoverable shit.

Women are so much nicer to be around than men. I feel so safe and comfy around women. Being around men is like being in a parked car in a parking lot of niggers. Gotta lock the doors, roll the windows up and dont make eye contact.

Depends on a curious balance between laziness and mental illness, but I suspect there may be a certain biological need regardless.

Classic girlthink. Correct and unrelated premises result in a baffling and illogical conclusion. 
Men don't pretend to like each other. If they can help it.
Absence is a preferred option. In the event of an external threat (such as employment or obligation), we can be stoic. Absence is preferable to feigned cordiality.

Classic girlthink. Consider the accomplishments of men compared to the accomplishments of women.

You know DIGIT GUY? Patrick Bateman?
"American Psycho" was written and directed by women.
Consider the business card scene.
They might as well be comparing designer handbags.

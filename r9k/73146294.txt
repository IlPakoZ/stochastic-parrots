But if it isnt my spaniard friend. How you doin.
I feel you. Also speak spanish. 
I think I ve learnt enough to consider myself able to speak the language, tho I know I ll never sound like a true native. That fucking accent will follow me everywhere I go.
Whats fun tho is the fact that, from the few interactions I ve had with english speaking folk, many seemed to believe I was actually from eastern Europe. Idk whats worse desu lol

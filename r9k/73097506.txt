I am fascinated by the personal lives and struggles of women. I desperately want to hear their life stories, their deepest and most embarrassing secrets, their hopes and dreams and the upbringing that likely inspired all of this.

It sometimes feels like I want to probe their minds as much as their sexual organs, if you could believe such a thing from a man on /r9k/. While I am paranoid of male imposters replying to this post and sullying the entire experiment, I will nonetheless ask the females of /r9k/ (all 7 of them) to recount to me their life experiences, secrets, hopes and desires.

Please be honest, and disregard what anybody (including me) might think of you as a result, no matter how shameful or embarrassing it is. I am not interested in the persona you adopt in front of others, only the real, subconscious you buried deep underneath.

Chads are ugly I don't like men with predatory eyes like a lizard, they mock me and they look like fuckboys so they don't look cute at all. I only like a cute and innocent boys. I think chads are my mortal nemesis or something, LOLs. Anyway OP, I'm having trouble coming up with anything I'm trying to think of a funny story to tell but all I can remember as of recent are my struggles with constipation on the toilet, sorry! When it comes to being constipated I recommend listening to pooping music on youtube to stimulate the bowels.

>came from an abusive druggy family
>met my ex online
>move in at 14
>end up adopted by his family
>together for many years
>mutually decide to breakup
>view each other as legitimate brother and sister
>finally move out to get a place of my own
>he moves in with me as my roommate

We're both doing our own thing but I know almost no guy will want to get with me because of this strange dynamic.

I had a hs friend that was kind of like this with my family (she came from a similar bg to you and also lived with us for a while) but after I stopped being friends with her it annoyed me that my mom still talked to her all the time. I was lowkey so happy when they finally stopped talking. No hard feelings towards her but I'm my mom's daughter NOT her and she was kind of sucking up all the attention and I hated being compared to her all the time. Oh why can't you be more like katelynne. Fuck katelynne I haven't talked to her in 5 years mom stop bringing her up lol

There's something so acutely pathetic about this post.

Holy shit, that sounds AWFUL, thankfully because we're the opposite gender there's no comparing us. I'd like him to move out soon, still be close of course, but out with his own GF. He's not financially able yet though, so I want to repay him for the same kindness his family gave me.

>their most embarrassing secrets
One time I peed in my pad because I had just put it on and didnt wanna get up and go to the bathroom again. It was a huge overnight one that surprisingly held it all. Maybe im just an ultra gross femcel but I think girls so a lot of gross stuff in private

you are correct. if she is living with her ex, she is still fucking her ex. only beta cucks will want you.

I understand why a guy would be distrustful.

yeah, I find it endearing. Its like learning an entirely new field of math, you start thinking of the possibilities and your whole frame of thinking changes. For example, did you know women think they're stronger than teenage/preteen boys and even manlets? They think they outrank them because they're taller.

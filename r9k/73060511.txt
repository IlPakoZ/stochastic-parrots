Zombies are only good for auto resolving and only if you have like five armies for every one they have.

i use them to hold the line. the other armies had flanking units

Yeah, 950 lichess, 850 quake champions

yeah, thats most people because of mindless distraction unmonitored breeding + shitty parenting and shitty education and also why our quality of life seems so low despite living like medieval kings. we are just more dysgenic than medieval peasants.

I don't know shit about the zombie faction, but brother if you have access to any ranged units get them. And you need to make the mobility of those flying units count for more.
Wargaming is actually hard, that's why we like it. keep going

You don't have any armor piercing capabilities really as vamps so you need to utilize magic more, and if I remember right orcs are resistant to fire so a lord/hero specd into death magic is ideal. What I would do is tie down the enemy lord with chaf and focus him down with debuff spells. Other than that, though, you're not gonna beat grimgor with a generic vamp lord. Grimgor iz da best

Oh and it's usually better to have vamp lords and heroes on flying mounts I'd they're not gonna be on a corpse cart, generally they suck at dueling and are better utilized casting from afar

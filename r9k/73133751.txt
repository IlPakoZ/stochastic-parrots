manifesting stealth points

>>73134214
Good evening anon. What are your plans for the weekend?
>>73134296
What are you intending to do with the stealth points?
--- 73134845
>>73134404
Only thing I have to do is go to work. Other than that... whatever I feel like doing. I hope that future me decides to learn something new instead of wasting time like usual :/
--- 73134865
>>73134404
why do you inquire what i do with my stealth points
--- 73134978
>>73134845
I have work as well. I wonder what I'll do with my freetime.
Is there anything in particular you want to learn?
>>73134865
I was mearly curious. What can you do with stealth points?
--- 73134990
>>73134978
what do you think you can do with stealth points anon
--- 73134991
>>73134978
Japanese in particular. I set up Anki but haven't touched it in the past few days :/
--- 73135059
>>73134990
You will use them to enhance you stealth skills so you can be sneaky and mess with people. 
>>73134991
Give a go anon. The sooner you start, the more you'll know. That reminds me... I have over 500 reviews stored from months ago. T_T

>>73135059
>I have over 500 reviews stored from months ago. T_T
That's so many, anon... but you can always do it later, right?
--- 73135248
>>73135059
mess with them how?
--- 73135255
>>73134171
>breakcore, lolicore
you won't find any real girls into any of this trash, most you can get is a pedo troon
--- 73135267
>>73135240
I can always do them later but it basically piled up and the only way to go through it all is to grind. Hopefully I remember a lot of them so I can click through most without having to relearn.
>>73135248
By pulling people's chairs out from under them or misplacing peoples stuff.
>>73135255
I'd like to think there are a few girls out there that like these genres. :(
--- 73135282
>>73135240
Damn Mio poster I can't believe what I learned about you in the tranny-kun thread today I just can't believe it dawg
--- 73135294
>>73135267
sounds like ur projectin 
anyways i think i should stop manifesting i don't think it's working anymore
--- 73135304
>>73135282
What was it???

>>73135267
I know that feeling. I would probably just give up, honestly.
--- 73135320
>>73135282
is the thread still up? nvm it is i looked for it kek i love drama
--- 73135330
>>73135294
Keep going! Don't give up!
>>73135304
Another option is for me to start from scratch again which would be way easier. I could probably just skip through all the cards I know. Perhaps I give it another go. All of summer is enough to finish the 2k deck.
--- 73135344
>>73135330
I did actually start from scratch but that's because I reset my laptop and lost everything. I prefer to start from scratch, anyway; there's a lot of holes in my knowledge due to how I learned Japanese (which is to say not very well at all).

>>73135320
Drama? What drama?
--- 73135376
>>73135344
sorry i don't like spoon feeding people
just look for it, its still up
--- 73135379
>>73135344
What did you do to learn japanese?
--- 73135410
>>73135376
Give me a hint.

>>73135379
I started out on the Duolingo app. Did that for a year (probably could have done it quicker). Now I'm planning on using some guide I found online. I think it was called Sakubi. It doesn't seem like the *right* way to go about doing it; you'd probably see better results from using a workbook like Genki, I assume. Whatever it is, I think interacting with the language every day is the most important thing you can do.
...did I say too much? Lol. I am not an expert.

>Anon... I can't show proof without showing my dick.
And... :3
--- 73135495
>>73135410
I began by taking 4 classes in japanese. I then found out about a guide on /djt/ on /jp/ called itazuraneko which lead me to begin my anki grind. I think immersion and mining cards would be the most effective way for learning from what I've read. My experience with genki when it was used in my class was good I'd say. I think its a solid foundation for beginning although I feel like there are more efficient ways at acquiring the same knowledge.
>>73135437
I don't feel comfortable with sharing dick pics on the internet.
--- 73135512
>>73135495
I know about Itazuraneko from /djt/ too. Funny how we found ourselves in the same place!
It wouldn't be hard for me to find material for immersion; there's a lot of VNs I'd love to work through. How about you, anon?

>I don't feel comfortable with sharing dick pics on the internet.
Discord time, baby...?
--- 73135522
>>73135512
Forgot my image. Uwa >~&lt;
--- 73135563
>>73135512
I mostly listen to music although its hard to use for immersion. I haven't decided which anime I'd watch for immersion. I suppose I would go through an old anime I haven't watched in a while as I'd know I'd atleast enjoy the show while learning something.
>Discord time, baby...?

Anons here are like
>why is /r9k/ so awful nowadays?
and then proceed to solely reply to the world's most obvious bait threads, while letting actually good threads die.

This is the board you deserve.

See the thing is, people can reply to their own bait threads and yo would never know.

The reason eightochan got shut down is because threads had post id's within threads making discussions possible with minimal deception. In this thread I could be anyone and if I was smart enough you would never tell. The person having a reasonable discussion with you and the erson calling you a faggot could be the same man using you for a laugh

How come people used to look much older than they are? 
Recently I watched footage of the 90s and early 2000s high school and they all looked like they were in there 20s or 30s compared to kids now.

Hair and clothing styles.

The farther back in time you go, the older high school and college students were trying to look. Look at pictures of high school students from the 1950's and it looks like an insurance salespeople convention.

Opposite. Also isn't it weird (but interesting) to see people have the same haircuts their whole lives? My older cousin's haircut has been the same since the 70's but to me it was just her hair. Started noticing it more

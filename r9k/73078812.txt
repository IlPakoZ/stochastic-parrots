Why does every single faggot trying to pretend to have "good taste" name drop these pasty, half-assed "indie" faggot screechers? I don't think anyone actually genuinely enjoys their shit.

Also, Crywank fucking sucks, and you only listen to that shit because of the name of the band. 

Examples of proper robotcore bands: Silkworm, The Smiths, Joy Division, Boards of Canada

I like all kinds of music as long as it's vaguely sad. some examples are none, coma cinema, mogwai, woods of desolation, grouper, have a nice life, carissa's wierd, lifelover, codeine, good night and good morning, rome, black wing, sprain and hood. slowcore is probably my favorite genre but I like all kinds of negative stuff.
--- 73080107
I listen to everything honestly but lately ive been listening to hella darkthrone, lifelover, gtt, crystal castles, gezebelle gaburgably, and drain gang
--- 73080153

Make me, sewer-water drinker. Maybe if you pretend to agree with every review Pitchfork's done over the past two decades, some arthoe with a similar disposition to being told what is good will let you smell her pussy. 

>>73080107
The fuck is with you faggots and Crystal Castles? They're so mediocre.

Personally I enjoy Commix, Ripsquad, Genesis , square puller, danny brown, death grips, m|o|o|n, porter robinson, Foxxy Dekay, current value, dog blood, seven lions, supercar, pains of being pure at heart, sadness, Jank, MUST DIE!

What do you mean "Finally" 
nhm is literally embedded into board culture, what the fuck happened to this shithole, so many newfags and normies...
--- 73080762
Anything by Pat Schneeweis (especially his earlier stuff) is essential robotcore since its about being a loser.

--- 73081022
>>73080918
No, I was answering your question about why so many people like the aforementioned band.
--- 73081181
Who is the guy in the image? I saw this song like 10 years and can't think of the name or even how to describe it when searching for it.

Cold Beer (Cry Tunes) by Jesse Stewart

He's dead now. 

Also it's a cover and the original is actually just a comedic skit by these Eastern Canadian silly guys.

I've been loving the beatles lately
Alex g always seems to be in my top played
I always confuse ellioth smith with Matt Elliot so I don't think I've ever heard a song from him, do you have a recommendation?
the smiths are great, which are your favorite songs of them?

to add I really like Aurora, alvvays, Beach House, pixies, Mazzy star, Patrick Watson and last but not least! the strokes

anons please help a fellow anon out, i'm catholic and i may be super autistic here but like i cant stop thinking about sex and intimacy of the sorts, like overall as a whole.
am i being strayed by the devil? is he trying to lead me away from my shepherd? i want a girlfriend and i want to make kids with her badly. i hate these thoughts but i cant help them, especially because i have a girl in mind.
this has been going on for a few weeks to be honest, the only times these thoughts disappear is in mass and prayer before i sleep, is there any way to get these thoughts out?

if they stop when you pray. then pray all the time. you can use the Jesus Prayer from our brothers the orthodoxs

1 Corinthians 7:9

"... it is better to marry than burn with passion..."


Can you find me a single priest who forbids or condemns thoughts like those? The only preaching ever done to me was to do all of the sexual activity within the confines of marriage. I heard of no limits being put on it beyond that except maybe foregoing contraceptives.

Why would God give you a sinful appetite? You just need to find someone. If you have someone in mind go talk to her and get it settled.

as a child (male) and kept captive from age 6 to 12. during that time i watched him kill 5 people and helped bury them, and even accidentally dug up a prostitute buried in a shallow grave near the creek. before anyone asks, it has been legally resolved and he is now dead. watched him saw a dude's arm off with a chainsaw. i was beaten literally once per day minimum, and wore piss soaked pants up to my shins having not bathed in months. to keep this short i wont type out the other shit, it was worse than you imagine.

so this made me an extremely abnormal person with extreme PTSD, with beaten dog syndrome. out of all the people on this board i probably have the worst life of anyone ive ever seen post here. even to you "losers" im an alien in this world. everyone hates me irl just from the aura of what someone else did to me, even though i personally didnt do anything wrong. i wasnt allowed to have any friends for fear i would "snitch", so never had a friend until 12 when i escaped, but then not after that either because i was too bizarre acting from being raised in an alien world by comparison to normal people

in fact its so far fetched sounding that none of you will believe it. and that's why im leaving this thread now and not responding to anyone. but it IS true. im posting this here only to vent because for whatever illogical reason if someone reads it it feels just slightly better.

What was the killer's name? Obviously my first thought is that this is a fun larp thread.

What was the killer's name? This one fact would immediately lend veracity to your story.

I can get you a job at Nintendo since my dad owns the place. Did I mention my dad is the CEO of Nintendo?

>gets mad when people don't believe him
Why are people like this? Just post proof like >>73146078 said.

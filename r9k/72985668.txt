Who else here 
>stacyonly
?
Fembots, nothing against you but we just work better as friends. Personally, I'm only attracted to stacy. I'm sure you're a great person with a lot to offer, but I just don't feel anything for you and I don't really care to conptemplate on or examine that.

I got a couple Stacy girls on the DL. But I'm not Stacy only. Unironically personality matters more to me.

I respect Lauren Southern a lot. She doesn't just tell people what they want to hear, she doesn't just repeat right wing talking points. When you watch a Lauren Southern video, you know you're hearing Lauren Southern's opinions. I'm glad to have her voice.

It's a much smaller list, but I like Jimmy Dore and Glenn Greenwald. Covid lockdown stuff is my hardline. Anyone who supported that is my enemy, and unfortunately that included most people on the left. Those two were and are great though. And they're also great on war and some other things.

You might as well add Tulsi Gabbard to the list if you're gonna mention right wing approved leftists. I wonder if there's anyone who's the right wing equivalent of that (right winger that leftists like, but other right wingers hate).

Yeah, she has a co-host this time, a radical feminist who shan't be named. Rumor has it they'll be hating on men together.

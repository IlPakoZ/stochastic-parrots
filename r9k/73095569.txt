So I had my first date today. It was OK. She even already scheduled another one. The thing is, I don't care. I thought that getting a gf would change my life, but honestly I don't feel anything.

that's because you relied on the numbers approach to dating, you'll never find genuine love that way.

genuine romantic love is age and time gated. if you weren't born tall and handsome and you didn't fall in love by coincidence when you were in high school or college, you've locked out of it.

This. That's why these "Bro just go make 900 attempts" types never made sense to me. I don't disagree with the math - you're guaranteed someone if you never give up.
However the key point is: You're not going to care by that point. The more effort, the more attempts, the less you'll care when you finally get it. Which is most likely after years of being alone anyway.

What a meaningless struggle.

I'm 6'0", generally considered handsome and in college.
I just don't care. I don't care about this person, or any for that matter, and I never did. The reason it took so long for this "social progress" is because I never gave a shit. Only now I have realized this. I want to die alone, people and relations aren't really worth the hype I think. Maybe I'm just depressed or something, though.

Likely. You'll regret not using those years to your advantage. It's much harder to meet cuties later on in life. Regardless, try and work your way out of that depression. Actually approach it as a problem you're trying to solve. It'll be worthwhile whether you want to date or not.

Going on a date once doesn't necessarily make her your girlfriend.

This is the brutal thing about 'making it'. The less you idealize women, the more likely you are to make it, but the less rewarding it is when you finally make it. Also if you make it when you're older it's not as intense or rewarding. I'm way better at flirting with girls now than when I was a teenager, but if I was able to do the things I can casually do now as a teenager, I would have been on cloud 9. Fuck life, hedonistic treadmill bullshit

Damn, literally me but you're probably younger by a few years. Every time I pursue a woman I end up losing interest very fast, even if I was initially super attracted and all the dates went well. Been on handfuls of dates with handfuls of women and still never had a gf. Definitely something wrong with my brain. Interpersonal relationships are just not my thing.

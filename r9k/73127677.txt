When she lampshaded her shitty mood/manic episode again she was saying something to the effect of "Maybe i need to take a walk or have some sex"

So yeah, there's a 70%+ chance she's going to cheat on me with some random chad in her cunt behind me back i fink 

I hope she's not stupid enough to openly tell me this, that would be the red line. I'm not going to become a literal cuck for her bipolar shit lmao

Also, the "sexual risk-taking behaviour" fits in perfectly with her letting herself get shagged on the first date by me too (without condor no less)
--- 73128643
>"she's a slut cause she slept with me"
--- 73128660
Ah yes fucking great

Brits. I have an honest question for you: how do you put up with all the insane shit your government does to you?

I thought Biden was bad, but whenever I'm having a bad day I just take a look at what's happening across the pond to realize that my life could be way, way fucking worse. Honestly. How do you put up with it? 

I've seen some of the most insane, dystopian shit come out of the UK. Hands down. And I never hear about any resistance to any of it. wtf if going on over there?

If you were in a car park one day, and accidentally reversed into someones car, then quickly drove off in the heat of the moment, you'd be panicking for weeks. Constantly worrying about CCTV, thinking if anyone saw your numberplate, anxious waiting for an NIP or the police to come knocking.

If you accidentally hit and killed a cyclist on a remote country lane, the gravity of the situation would be so extreme, your brain wouldn't process it and you wouldn't have a care in the world

She's ""thanked me for my patience"" like almost a dozen times now too, that's the kicker here.

Like, that's about all she does. "Thanking me" and then promptly proceeding to write some bullshit evasive low-effort one-liner responses that aren't even really saying anything of substance 

It's fucking bizarre, and i truly don't know what her endgame is here with this shit she keeps pulling (if there even is one)

Essentially told her now to finally stop projecting all her shit on to me ("hurr you must be hiding something from me, but i still won't be elaborating the actual thought process behind my irrational paranoia"), come clean and get herself checked out at a shrink for her unstable moods and nervous breakdowns if she hasn't done so already. 

Otherwise the whole thing is pretty much fucking pointless since it always runs in these same predictable (and frankly tiring) bullshit vicious cycles with her bipolar ass

full blown anarcho-tyranny, anarcho because the criminals can rape and murder as much as they want but if you defend yourself with a towel after someone breaks into your home and rapes your unborn daughter through the pussy of your wife with a red-hot bar of metal youll be jailed for life and have your feet cut off

It's full to the brim and the people are rude, selfish, and unkind. The weather sucks, and the cities are absolutely grim.

That's retatded, it's the opposite. Tourists go to the city so they can go shopping, get drunk and do other city shit

>There's always someone worse off than you x

That's not positive at all. You're trying to enable your poor behaviour by using other people as a scapegoat. Its classic depression addict behaviour and with that mindset you wont change.

Fast as the wind, the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way
Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lighting phantoms swarm
Two hundred miles at nightfall
Taken within a day
Thus earning their name
Earning the fame
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Living or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread
Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale with the the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way
Leaving a trail of destruction to a foreign land (waging war with conviction)
Massive assault made to serve the Nazi plan (Wehrmacht's pride, ghost division)
Communication's broken
Phantom's are far away
Thus earning their name
Earning the fame
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Living or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

There's a metric SHITTON of SEA wahminoids i've been matching with again

Swear to fuck if the bipolar paranoid gold-digging wall-hitting gf trashes the relationshit i'll go for one of these instead

At least these SEA women appreciate the BWC rather than sabotating it

big gay African men
--- 73139904
Been to Africa once, didn't enjoy it
--- 73139917
>>73139904
Was it because of all the big gays?
--- 73139918
>>73139904
I've also been to London and wouldn't recommend it.
--- 73139940
>>73139917
Unironically it was because of the Africans.

Also I got food poisoning the day I was leaving, had a horrid flight and then shat myself when I got home

23 hour thread. Remember when britfeel was bouncing on the weekends.
--- 73140063
Britfeel is dying waheeeey. Let's all have a party now that Britfeel is fucking dead waheeeey!!!!
--- 73140085

Just us idiots left waving as everyone leaves.
>>73140063
>/britfeel/ is dying
>/britfeel is dead
Ask me how I know you're retarded.
--- 73140124
>>73140085
You don't need to be asked. Anyone can take one look at me and know that I am a retard. One look is all you will need, trust me. Go ahead and look. Go for it. It's just us two on the thread right now.
--- 73140142
>>73140124
I shouldn't have been mean. I am also retard.
Sorry.
--- 73140168
>>73140142
It really is just the two of us in the thread right now, we should be nice to each other. What would you like to discuss?
--- 73140221
>>73140168
I can't really hold a conversation. I'm fairly low IQ, calling myself a retard wasn't fair, I'm actually a pleb.
--- 73140264
>>73140221
Well then I guess we'll just let britfeel die then. Good riddance.
--- 73140306

Literally no-one cares 
Not us, not your spastic football team, not your ugly mother, no-one
--- 73140427
In my mind int/brit/ and brit/pol/ will absolutely survive until the very last day of 4chan, whenever that might be. /britfeel/ however really has a realistic chance of dying before then, it's still in the balance though. We may suddenly get a wave of new blood in 2023/2024 that keeps it going forever. We already had FBR as a new addition for 2022

--- 73140557
>>73140427
/britfeel/ will become a thread that lasts 5 or more days, 10 posters but the bulk of the posts will be by 4 posters posting their gimmicks and trying to rile each other up.
--- 73140576

I'm set to inherit 17 million pounds in a few weeks. I know that logically there is no reason everything won't run as smoothly as I'm predicating, but as it stands I'm still as penny pinching as ever. Until it's in the bank I won't comprehend it being real. Do get tempted to by a new car I've seen, but can't bring myself to do it until the money is in the bank

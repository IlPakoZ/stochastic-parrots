Yawn. Counting posts until you admit you're one of those "friendless" guys with a 10 year old friend circle that mysteriously doesn't count because "I don't see them often".

It's always the same with you people.

Spend some time trying to make online friends on /soc/ or something, realize how fucking dull/obnoxious most people are and conclude being alone is probably the best option rather than repeatedly rolling the dice on finding someone you actually gel with who also happens to like you.

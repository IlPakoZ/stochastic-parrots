maybe but not really, at that size its easy to fluctuate between 230-250 its not to the point of being really fat the way we think of it i think. he can get thin pretty easy pretty fast if he tried (as opposed to being obese in a helplessly far gone way where he would have loose skin after)
--- 73059249

Oh
Were you the Chubby anon from the other thread? Borderline obese and overwheigt?
--- 73059376
not to sound too shilly but i can understand why a "straight" guy might be into a trans woman, if there's enough surgery involved it's just run of the mill butt stuff. same with a lesbian woman i guess, it's more convenient. that being said i do not know how trans men are in any sort of happy state in life. straight women i feel like might settle but it's a bit weird, but gay men? i don't know why any genuinely gay man would ever be into a transman. i feel like the dick is extremely integral to the relationship for gay men, even if you're a top and the tranny in this hypothetical would be the bottom

>Were you the Chubby anon from the other thread? Borderline obese and overweight?
Yeah. If I lose it quickly I have the chance of having loose skin. If I fit into 36" waist pants, I won't have any health risks. Plus I have a chest bone deformity so if I was the "ideal" weight I would look like a concentration camp inmate. 
>>73059339

--- 73059426
>>73059397
Huh, c'est deformity, that's odd, and lose skin isn't that bad, i think it goes away after a bit?
But yeah, you should make a bit more physical activity, as long as it isn't a health risk
--- 73059436
>>73059394
kinda. i don't think i'd consider a man bisexual if the only other men he sleeps with are transmen that haven't put any effort into their appearance (aka still a woman)
>>73059402
im not a pinkpiller but at the same time i think if you fall for the pink pill you were already some flavor of tranny to begin with, like i don't think it's real that you can be psyoped into it.

--- 73059463
>>73059436
I don't think trans people who don't put effort into their appearance should be called trans...
But anyhow, most trans people, ftm or mtf are mostly gunning for bi people because it's easier to deal than straight or gay
--- 73059466

My man where the fuck do you think you are?
--- 73059494
>>73059463
from what i've gathered i think that transmen have it easier appearance wise. testosterone is really strong and pretty quickly can make a girl look like a guy. but sexually it's probably twice as hard since i think dick really matters to people who are into guys that look like guys. on the other side i think that while trans women have the hardest time actually looking like women, there's people who would happily fuck them at any stage of their transition

ew that's not a snack, unironically just starve. not in like a gross anorexic way, but track your calories and just eat at a deficit really slowly. i lost like 20 pounds in like 2 months from it alone
--- 73059527
>>73059494
That's why I say bi people is more their thing
They are less likely to mind the no dick bit, even bicurious guys or "not gay", and they will also ignore the Lack of fem into trans women, that's sex
But a relationship, no luck
I don't think either have it easy getting one, i took the pinkpill myself, pic up on thread, people really just dislikes me

I'm a serious homebody and unlike /tttt/ not everyone here is fully retarded and thinks sex is the answer to everything.
--- 73059550
I firmly believe that gay death isn't real, you don't suddenly age up 30 years at 25. It's just a matter of aesthetics shifting, that being said I do think specifically femboys have a very very very explicit expiration date, even with hormones.
--- 73059563
>>73059436
>im not a pinkpiller but at the same time i think if you fall for the pink pill you were already some flavor of tranny to begin with, like i don't think it's real that you can be psyoped into it.
just depends what you believe when you say psyop.
the penultimate claim behind all troons is a alienation from birth gender. which is something that can happen a lot of ways. it can certainly be groomed. but even still, boys need to have an archetypically sound understanding of masculinity and how they fit into it- which usually happens through the father or society. detachment from either or both creates a vacuum eagerly filled by pinkpillers. its that simple

the psyop isnt always directly executed and like most mental illnesses is simply a shitstorm but is nontheless not a path they woudlve walked had they been born in a different era or had they not experienced any such alienation like if any troon had a good relationship to their parents and more importantly themselves
--- 73059573
>>73059545
>not everyone here is fully retarded and thinks sex is the answer to everything.
It depends on the time of day, heh. But I think that most people here are fully retarded though, it's very rare that you get a coherent conversation. I guess when I asked what kept you here, is that I kind of figured after a point you just sort of outgrow the site, that most people kind of just get a BF or decide to focus on something else after 25ish (unrelated to the gay death number but an interesting correlation). I think the oldest I've seen other anons here never go past 30, which is why I've come to this conclusion.
--- 73059582
>>73059550
And what date is that?
--- 73059603
>>73059550
Gay death isn't real unless you're "gay alive" (lots of unprotected sex with strangers, hard drugs like meth or coke, mixing the two together, sex at glory holes or something like that). Getting older is normal and to say that guys stop being attractive at 25 is dumb.
--- 73059615
>>73059457
peak pseud, this is why nobody takes you seriously
--- 73059660
>>73059563
i don't think it's a psyop because i guess pinkpilling also depends on definition, but the conclusion is kind of the same. if you're convinced you're a tranny (and DIY hrt) because you're sad about stuff and it gets turned into a dysphoria thing i can see why that would be called a psyop, but there's way more factors there that shift the blame into other things. i think that if you start taking hrt because you desperately want to retain a certain image and don't want to "age into an old man", you're probably actually a tranny. that's not really a normal thought people have, it's okay to not want to be old but i think that if your solution is to take body altering chemicals that actively feminize you, then it's a deeper thing.

--- 73061634
>>73061433
I honestly got really flustered reading this as well oops
The gainer thing is ludicrously hot to me but only within limits and mostly as an offshoot of what you just described, I like the idea of having a lifestyle with your bf where you're so pampered and comfy that you end up letting yourself go and getting pudgy, the whole concept of 'relationship weight' gets me off so goddamn much you wouldn't believe. I'm not into the really extreme side of it, the people who gain like hundreds of pounds and fetishize the various health problems that develop as a result of doing so are fucking gross to me. I completely understand how even the 'milder' forms of the fetish could be gross and alienating to some people tho
Also I'm not really that 'little' I'm like 5'11, srry for being so consistently disappointing anon

--- 73061882
>>73061634
yeah to be honest i kind of feel like my attraction to it is more like a grandmas attraction? i just want to get a boy fed and happy and then the sexual stuff is kind of secondary to the fact i like him for being a qt. im not too sure where the sexual stuff starts and ends but ive not always been a healthy weight and i think knowing how shitty being overweight is prevents me from wanting to get a guy legit fat; im more into food coma or something but no long term shit.
a boy with a fast metabolism who i could feed and give headpats to endlessly and have him remain a good weight is what i like. do you like the idea of...for example if your bf ate the last of something and he was chewing it and you said you wanted it, and he gave it to you. do you accept?

Lateass reply sorry. I completely get where you're coming from and yeah i wouldnt want to end up 'legit fat', maybe like a few pounds overweight at most. I'm just totally enamored with the idea of your bf's love and constant pampering manifesting itself in ur appearance somehow it's hot and cute idk
 Incidentally I do actually have an inhumanly fast metabolism and do genuinely struggle to gain wright (hence why I have to resort to larping on imageboards in order to indulge my fetish instead of just actively gaining like a normal person) so make of that information what you will.
I'm curious what you mean by that, I'm imagining the way birds feed their young by regurgitating partially broken down food into their mouth? Sounds kinda gross, I may have a depraved and unhealthy fetish but I still value hygiene yknow

At least if the timezones match up it's a little better, but online only sounds hard because then you have to be good at thinking of things to talk about without shared experiences to draw from

I don't think that will be a real issue because there's still plenty to do online but ideally physically meeting up shouldn't be a hard thing, don't think a relationship can survive that

I tried to be sociable with family last night, set aside time to watch something with them and everything
Fell though because they couldnt find anything they wanted to watch, ignored my suggestions, and sat on their phones
Then just now I tried being social with online friends, set up something to do, that fell through too because one has a headache and another just said no

On Sunday mom usually cooked a roast or put a steak in the oven to cook. What I wouldn't give to have a bite of one again. I know I could cook one myself but they're a lot of work and I'm too lazy to do the cleanup afterward.
--- 73070693
>>73070644

Right now I'm cooking some frozen fish fillets in the oven. I've never had these before so we'll see if they're good. I bought them cheap from save-a-lot (a really bargin/cheap store) so I wonder,

--- 73070723
>>73070693
What were you marinating tho?
You should try making ceviche with the fish fillets, not that good when overcooked
How are your cats?
Yknow, you could try one pot recipes, toast is one i think
--- 73070746
>>73070697
Wow, what are the most interesting one then?
I don't usually search for threads much, hard to relate to less general ones

What bout choccy tho?
I haven't had any in so long, i wish I had cacao pods more tho
--- 73070810
>>73070723

not anything marinating right now. I normally start that in the morning for dinner that night. I have no idea what ceviche even is. cats are fine. I do cook some things but where I went for the litter is higher on their meat prices than where I normally go for food so I never usually get meat there. Thus my only options for dinner tonight were frozen or delivery.
--- 73070836
At this point I think I'd be satisfied by just watching cute boys do stuff, in person.
--- 73070865
>>73070836
so true

I don't ask for much. It'd just be nice to watch a cute boy go about his day. Being a stalker seems like challenging but rewarding work.
--- 73070883
>>73070810
Oooh
I thought you had prepared something for the week, my dad usually left meat sliced marinating on a bag on the fridge
Like chicken, you can wash and skin chicken for the week

Ceviche is just raw fish with lemon, salt and spices, maaaaybe dill
I like it lots, frozen fish is great for it, even tilapia
--- 73070900
>>73070746
>What bout choccy tho?
I wish they hid choccy and sweets from me :/
I liked the one with rice i ate yesterday. Very light. Today i ate a lot of cacao ones i guess. I think i'll vomit, probably not though
>I don't usually search for threads much, hard to relate to less general ones
I often find reletable ones. Maybe i'm just basic 
Best one hmmmmm it's hard to say and i didnt read many yet. I'm phoneposting and multitasking so ;-;
But tomorrow! If you are still here i will find good threads for you maybe hahaha
--- 73070903
>>73070883
these are already battered and stuff.

For marinating I normally do that with pork chops. She would do it with roasts and steaks but I haven't tried one of those yet. Chicken I put put in salt water for about an hour or so before I cook it. My chicken actually turns out pretty good. I don't have any chicken now though as I haven't gone to my main food store this week yet.

>What are you getting 
Think of it as a parasocial relationship except instead of feeling like friends or lovers with a person from the internet. You instead feel the same for a real person. I think also being able to watch someone from a far while they think they are completely alone is nice. They are less likely to act and look how they would in social settings. You get to see the truest form of the person without any of the social baggage. People are also just interesting to watch. There is a reason people will people watch in public places and there is a reason why that one internet show "Fishtank live" is popular. 

Watching someone to me also feels more obtainable and tangible to me. I cant really realistically imagine myself in a relationship. Its just not something which could happen.
--- 73071004
>>73070962

they're basically large fish sticks, and you only get get 8 in a box. Very disappointing and I doubt I'll get them again even if they are good. 

I'll get some more food tomorrow probably. Mom and I used to go to multiple stores on one day but I'm not up that yet. Going to one mentally tires me, mostly the driving part, since I HATE that more than anything.

I'm scared of making a mistake and hurting myself or someone else. Plus I technically do not have a license since I let it expire some years past and I would have to go through the testing process again, which is hard as someone with no family. If I get pulled over I'm basically screwed. Not only am I unlicensed, I'm also uninsured since I'm not a licensed driver. The car is also in mom's name, which may also create issues.

Rip anon. You get the bullet but i'll make it quick ;)
--- 73071339
>>73071270

I don't see a way out of it, really. If I get a learner's permit, then legally I have to have a licensed driver in the car with me. If I show up to the testing site alone they're going to know I drove there by myself and violated this. Without someone to go with me, I can't get my license again. Mom's friends don't even know about this because they just assumed I kept my license current, even without a car. 

Speaking of them, neither has contacted me really (except for one to pick up a a few things she had let my mom borrow) since the funeral. I doubt I could ask them to do something like that.
--- 73071365

I don't know if the dmv people would mind you driving there that much but I don't know

>>73071339
>If I show up to the testing site alone they're going to know I drove there by myself and violated this
Bullshit. I drove myself to all my driving tests. They won't ask, they won't bother they won't care. If they do, which they won't, just lie.
--- 73071381
>>73071292
Whyyyyy
Why so much hate on meeeee
No faaaair

the closest family I have are 2nd cousins, both of which who live pretty far away, have their own health problems, and didn't come to mom's funeral despite knowing almost a week in advance. I basically have no family.
--- 73071443
>>73071393
They won't care that you drove yourself there, they won't even ask
--- 73071477
>>73071443

I'm scared that they will. The last one I took was done by the highway patrol, not the DMV. Some gov office worker might not care but I think cops will.

Don't worry anon, i'm just bored and messing around. I don't like furries (true) but i don't actually care that much &lt;3
--- 73071508

They won't. You're just creating more excuses for not doing the things you have to do. 
You always do that
--- 73071514
I like furries, since I'm one too. What's your favorite animal?
--- 73071527
>>73071514
I'm also a furry

My fav animals are wolves and foxes, stereotypically. But I like raccoons and hyenas too
--- 73071529

well I'm gonna have to do something before September because that's when mom would have to get a new sticker for her plate. If I drive after that I'll likely be pulled over for the expired tags.

>>73073172

No, I'm storyanon. I haven't seen a doctor is about 6 years when I went to a clinic for an ear infection. That was just a nurse practitioner. Mom practically made me go. 

The last time I was actually examined by a real doctor was my last visit to my childhood doctor when I was 17 or 18.

coc (the original at least) is pretty goated. played that shit for years, now i've basically read every line of text that you can possibly encounter in that game ten-thousand times and it doesn't work for me anymore. count your blessings nony.
--- 73074063
>>73074047
i've been playing coc2, coc was weird to me when i first came across it and i didn't really get it. been actually committed to coc2 which feels, weird and degen, but also i've been blowing a lot of loads to it. sucks there's never enough males though
--- 73074067

another good one is degrees of lewdity if you're an abject degenerate like me. it has rudimentary sprite graphics and you can tweak the settings and make only male NPCs in the world.
--- 73074119
>>73074067
looking into it, seems interesting enough honestly. the only other i've played i forget the name of but was a space sci-fi one. not trials in tainted space, had an honestly shitty art style but pretty much all the npcs were male

--- 73075031
>>73074960
I see. I mean AM also. My appointments are for getting my blood drawn and a follow up with my doctors. Do you have any plans for your day without your mom around?
--- 73075087
>>73075031
nope i have no plans for the day honestly i was thinking of walking to the liqqy store and having a day or two with that hehe... so just a regular check up then? is that an early appointment? do you try to make all of you appointments early even if your sleep schedule is shifted to later in the day? i always find it easier to stay awake for 24+ hours than wake up so i do exactly that
--- 73075121
>>73075087
Liquor has never really been my thing but it sounds like a fun plan regardless. You should find a show to watch while you're drinking away. It's kind of a regular check up, it's more just seeing how I've responded to an increase in synthroid and how my immune system is interacting with all of that. I do try to get my appointments early though, yeah. Personally I'll just go with next to no sleep as long as I get to the appointment, but it helps just fix my schedule enough if I need to.
--- 73075175
why won't venti lego latino anon just go full horny whore, that's what he is isn't he?

>synthroid
what is going on anon? i dont know what that is about but it seems like it could be more serious than just a sidenote here
--- 73075194
>>73075177
You should look into brewing booze sometime, anon. You might enjoy it if you like to indulge in liquor every now and then -- could make for a good hobby. Don't worry about the synthroid stuff, I just have an atypical case of Hashimoto's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashimoto's_thyroiditis It's actually a pretty common autoimmune disorder, I just drew some bad luck in inheriting it and somehow having my immune system be odd on top of it.
--- 73075225
>>73075194
unfortunately i dont have much space right now so i cant brew alcohol(probably) and more importantly mom is very anti alcohol... are you mostly in control of your health situation then? like is all of that routine at the moment or is there something that could come up? basically is there any stress for you or is it just an annoying check in?
--- 73075274
>>73075225
You might only need like 4 square feet of floor space for a good carboy, it's just a bit of a process to start it up and there's a good amount of time you'll be waiting. You also wouldn't a constant concoction of boiling CO2 in your bedroom or anything. Your mom is likely the only real obstacle to it all though. I'm in control of my health though, yeah, it's nothing I can't handle/haven't handled already. I wouldn't call it routine because I haven't been on these hormones for even a year and the last blood test I had got my dosage upped by 50%(50 mcg to 75 mcg) and it's almost certainly going to get upped again. The only stress is just having to go out anywhere, I'm not the most social person and I especially don't like being out in public. Pic related is a carboy though, it's cool to watch all of the bubbles forming if you set up everything right.
--- 73075299
>>73075274
are there any noticeable differences since youve been on the meds? im glad it isnt stressing you out very much im assuming that means everything is going well or at least expected.sadly my mom is a big obstacle for that kind of thing she would pour any alcohol i have in the sink if she was in a mood but it does sound really cool
--- 73075332
>>73075299
Well when my immune system isn't chewing up my thyroid or when I just got the medicine/an upped dosage then everything works out great and I feel a whole lot better. My immune system then just acts like it's bipolar and I cycle from suffering mild hypothyroidism to being normal. It's a shame you can't brew though, I wanted to get back into it myself because I wanted to make yeast extract from the leftovers. It's in a bunch of food you've likely already eaten(they even put it in soup stock). I doubt you could convince your mom to let you do that for the culinary experience though. Here's a nice video on it you might like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zEWtqkp1v8 [Embed]
--- 73075410
>>73075332
can you describe what that feels like? you can skip it because im terrible at describing anything... ill check out the video(watching at the moment) but youre likely right... mom is inconsistently strict and annoying
--- 73075430
>>73075410
Well, when I'm mildly hypothyroidic then I'm just tired all of the time. If I exercise beyond just simple cardio(and even sometimes then if I push it) I get sore much easier and it takes like twice as long to recover. Chronic constipation, my skin dries out on my face making areas red and itchy looking, things just seem cloudier mentally. When it's cold out you really notice it, can't have my AC working too much because of it. You mentioned feeling not too well before, are you wondering if you have Hashimoto's or a thyroid issue now?

Also can you explain what your mom's like? Inconsistently strict and annoying sounds familiar.
--- 73075444
still looking for a cute anon nearby I can care for, give him cuddles and love, cook together, play videogames together and at the end of the day dick him down till he's silly...
--- 73075474
>>73075444
I'm not an expert but this sounds kinda homo anon
--- 73075488
>>73075430
im not wondering if i have hashimotos im just interested in your experience. that really does sound annoying by the way so im sorry you have had to deal with that... things feeling cloudier mentally is something really familiar to me but im not sure if we mean the same thing do you feel like you forget things during the day or just dont feel like youve been in your body for a while? what do you mean with that?
>can you explain your mom
not completely... she has some rules and little things that bother her and she wants a certain solution to that but she doesnt always care about these rules though suddenly she will become focused and assertive on them in an aggressive kind of scary way. she will randomly go a long time without mentioning anything that bothers her which makes it a lot worse
--- 73075525
>he likes g*rls
uhoh
--- 73075536
>>73072881
I didn't mean you desu
--- 73075572
Horrible sleep. I'm so tired. How am i supposed to do anything today?
--- 73075600
>>73075488
It's all good, anon. I do tend to forget things throughout the day, yeah, also I'm not as performant as I would otherwise be. Things are harder to figure out than what's normal, it's easier for me to zone out, etc.. Your mom is kind of reminding me of my mom, although she's not so strict. If anything she's more overprotective/overbearing but cycles between doing just about nothing and wanting to do tons of work all the time, right this second.

Do you have any health issues, anon?
>>73075525

>>73075600
not to rant about my mom too much but my mom is so controlling about the weirdest things and ive always had a hard time thinking it was protective but it probably is. not completely related to the conversation but mom has not been the main parent in my life my grandparents were and i think that changes our situation to normal people... i find myself absent minded a lot and that feels really similar to your situation, but its not exactly the same of course so im a bit nervous to give my own too much importance. is your situation with your mother still similar to that or moving away now?
--- 73075777
>>73075738
I guess our situation isn't too dissimilar. I spent a good amount of time taking care of my grandpa before he passed, pretty much my late teens and early 20s. My mom is a bit controlling, but I think it's more that she doesn't want to be alone. I've tried to talk about moving out, she doesn't want it to happen at all. Out of curiosity, what's your diet like? What kinds of foods do you normally eat?

very similar. i will always think about the days before my grandfather died, and i had taken care of my grandmother for a while but she is still alive right now. i moved out from my mom at 20 and i am back with her now instead of taking care of my grandmother which hurts a bit. however i am not moving out because i dont have any job prospects at all... my diet is pretty bad because i usually eat one meal a day and outside of that it is very sodium heavy diet example ill just eat salami or sopressa with something like graprefruit
--- 73075890
>>73075835
>no job prospects
>one meal a day, high in sodium
Hey, we're even more similar (^:. I only ever get like maybe 2x the daily recommended dose for an adult, which is fine since I drink a lot and I'm tall and all. Do you take any vitamin supplements? Lacking a varied diet pretty much necessitates it.

i have never taken supplements but i dont think im lacking anything since im 6'2 150lbs 188cm 68kg i just know my diet is bad because i do not keep a diet at all and pretty much eat once day.

You should really take some supplements, it might help with that cloudiness. Is there anything else that might be a problem or any other unhealthy habits that you have?
--- 73076005
>>73075986
to be honest my only unhealthy habits are staying awake for 24+ hours but i have never in my life taken supplements of any kind

You should definitely get more sleep. Do you at least sleep close to 16 hours after you stay up that long? It really isn't good for you, fren.
--- 73076094
>>73076071
not even close to 16hours lol. my sleep is very inconstant so i cant give you a real range but just int the last month i have done multiple 36 hours. i thought 8 hours of sleep was considered good?
--- 73076101
>>73076071
inconsistent. spell check tricked me for some reason
--- 73076111

--- 73076141
>>73076094
>>73076101
All good and no 8 hours is pretty much the minimum you should have per 24 hours. You want more if you're not sleeping for prolonged periods of time. That's all pretty bad, anon. Your sleep and health are important.
--- 73076315

I've told my sister before and a few people I knew growing up. Don't recall ever telling my mom, never told my ol' folks either. My mom has said some things to me before that made me think that she suspected or knew though. Stuff like "I think when you're really smart you don't care so much what you love." or similar. What about you? I wonder how your mom has/would react to that.

I just use emus for free on pc. 
Klonoa is not very popular :(
I liked switch remake and gba games were amazing too
>mario
My fav by far is 3d world. Love the cat power and such. Very cool fights. Bowsers fury was amazing as well. Odyssey is great, so is galaxy and u deluxe. Basically switch mario(ports included) > rest
>land
Cool platforming with powers and ok combat. Very fun, kinda like kirby but not as good. I only played pc games as a kid. I didn't play much though
Not that into music. Potc, can't say i like em
>lbp
I only liked sackboy. Played it on pc not too long ago. It has great music heh
>crysis
I have no idea about online. You should give it a shot it's one of the better fps games for sure
>never ever multiplayer?
I liked playing dnf duel with him though i dislike fighting games(it was kinda fun)... we played few beat em ups... playing with strangers feels horrible though. I have zero desire to play anything but singleplayer 
>river city girls
Probably. He should try it. I'm waiting for 2 to be on discount so i can play on switch 
>yeah its too much pressure to do the right thing and not have sub optimal experience. i fucked up my botw build, i spent all my orbs on stamina and then never had enough hearts when i got to certain monsters. i never beat it and the second games out in a month
I just think it's tedious. Speaking of botw it's the first game i bought for switch. Still didn't play after over a year. Because i know it will take time. Now you say you can fuck up your build? I didn't hear it was hard. I'm not that excited to play it anymore :/
>Gta
Yeah. I'd hate that now but i had fun when i was younger. I like levels and goals. Too much to do makes me lose interest 
>i find that strange
:3
>how come not right now?
I have other shorter series to complete. And i'm saving it for when i run out of good fps. I just beat necromunda, t'was fun.
--- 73076427
>>73033069 →
>>73032773 →
As for halo i'll just play in chronological order and only singleplayer ones. I will look it up when the time comes. Maybe i won't like it but i think i will. I prefer more realistic weapons like in wolfenstein and stuff. Zombies and demons, not aliens. Space is lame. You say not much but you listed a lot lol
>do you happen to know his reaction to the ftm shooter in TN? i wanted to look but never did
I know little about the shooting and didn't see him react. He did humiliate milo in a debate that they sorta mention it i think. Adin is funny and probably retarded but also he plays it up for the camera as well.
It's a must see interaction

>still am!!!! but yeah kinda, for a controller player anyway
>Controller
*sigh*
This is the part where i tell you fps games are played with wasd plus mouse
>i agree although i feel like the money isnt worth it without multi desu
I pirate the fuck out of games. Speaking of which why is there still no pirated version of callisto protocol? I' not paying over 50e for that shit. But i'd try it if it's free
>wdym?
I didn't expect you to be that good u guess
>I hate puzzles
Yeah they can be hard and i just like action and stuff
>do you like detective type stuff like profiling?
Used to, now i find it boring and it's hard to focus
>you played it though?
Yeah :/
>everyone loves that but i never played it as a kid(or adult)
Give it a shot idk. I hate sniper elite elite games but zombie army is very fun. Zombie games are decent

the only person ive told directly with confidence is a cousin and they have taken my privacy very seriously even if i wish theyd spread the rumor a little heh... in a similar experience my grandmother has mentioned "one day youll have a boyfriend or relationship"
>i wonder how your mom would react
i honestly dont think my mom would care or be surprised but i dont see a way to breach the topic in casual conversation and im not going to bring it up myself
--- 73076563
>>73076487
*lick* *lick*
Aww, Is it getting any better anon? What's the biggest problem that you're facing right now?
--- 73076568
>>73076539
Why do you wish they'd spread the rumor around a bit? Is there someone you're interested in that you'd want to find out? I feel like if I told my mom directly she'd just try and play matchmaker again. She already tried to push me towards some of my sister's friends before(with my sister going along with that). She really loves to just try and involve herself in anything that I do, despite me telling her not to.

i just sat down to wrap up my other stuff, im sorry. im terminally retarded and i hate the 2000 char limit and might just pull the trigger and fully get around it. i thought about it last time i took forever to respond and probably will now 

thinking of just using paste bin or something. because my issue is i currently use a word counter site and temper what i say based on how much i dont want to have to add a new post. and it stifles me and forces me to procrastinate. bad idea to do that?
--- 73076640
i used to think it would be okay to come out to my family but then i genuinely asked my mother for help for the first time in my entire life and she immediately made it about herself and told everyone she knows and our entire extended family all about my problems completely behind my back even though i deliberately asked her not to so i only found out about it after arriving at a large gathering months later and being ambushed by several dozen people who all wanted to pry
--- 73076663
>>73076615
Spoiler is some schizo shit idk what to say. I have no idea, do what's easier i guess. Actually i think i prefer later replies it can get draining if it's too often as it takes me a while to type it out and read your and shit. So no worries

>>73076615
If you're exceeding the character limit have you considered moving the conversation off-site to a third party communication platform? Or at least parsing your reply into properly formatted paragraphs rather than taking up half the page with green text?
--- 73076819
>>73076716
i think neither of us want to move off-site because it changes the expectations and conversation. the style of conversation achieved on this site is unlike any other and beyond that intimate messaging isnt the ideal and again [avoiding] that isnt possible using modern instant messengers. i think we both want to retain the distance we get in anonymity here
i have actually had the idea of setting up a vichan/(now basically sharty) instance to dedicate threads to talking to people but setting it up so its private so only me and the other person can read it. so anytime i meet people i want to talk to i set up a separate board only they can access and have conversations in this same image board style. it would make me infinitely more productive personally 
the greentext spam is an issue but thats the way it is because theirs more to address than characters i can commit to it leading to a shitty ratio of green text where theirs a lot of short replies. and even in cases where the green text is less then 5 words per, it can often mean referencing back multiple threads to refollow the conversation
this is why i need more charters
--- 73076831
>gives you a private board on his own imageboard instance

--- 73077317
>>73077019
theirs actual lore out there on why but im pretty sure the answer is that its just a thing that particular publishing house does. i dont know if theirs an official reason, i think theyve just done a good job getting high quality books written for them and its almost become like a "X for dummies" sort of thing except its actual textbooks and not readers digest tier shit. their might be a story about the first guy to do it and why they began making it their standard but i think for the most part its a brand thing now

Consume the actual ISO standard, or an abridged version of it (like those in tutorials or books), in whatever way you like (reading, watching, etc.) and remember it?
Pretty much like learning anything. Also take your time, do it at your own pace.
--- 73077735

It's over.
--- 73077753
if by fictional men you mean anime "boys" then no, it's not over, you're just prisongay and just need to get a smidgen of pussy.
if you mean fictional men as in a book or movie character then yeah, it's basically over. no one in real life can match up to that.

I don't know, it's a chuck steak. Mom usually put those in the oven. I had thought about just frying it in the skillet but on looking at it, it's very thick I don't think that'll work. 

I just hope I don't mess it up.

Hi I am your local ventiposter and I'm looking for a bf. Only serious offers please. I want a cutie to marry and love. I want to show him my star wars legos and lick him as well. He should be educated in the religious arts. He must be right wing. We will troll trannies together.

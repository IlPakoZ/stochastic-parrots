I dont feel good during. I dont feel good after. It's just horrible and painful and shitty. On top of this I dont even know if i'm doing it right because there's a trillion permutations of diets, workout plans, and supplements that people argue about and cant agree on

I've been at it for four months. Am I wasting my time or no?

If it makes you feel bad, then do something different. Reduce the number of exercices, do it at home instead of the gym, choose different exercices. And if it still makes you feel bad, then just don't work out, and do sports/cardio instead.

You are obviously wasting your time. You even admitted that you hate it, so why would you continue to do it? There are no meaningful benefits to exercising anyway, but nutrition can change you massively in either direction so you should really look into that

how can i be attractive if i dont work out? I also get angry at the people arouind me in the gym who seemingly arent bothered by it. Also people online wont stfu about how they 'go 2 da gym' all the time so i also get FOMO

If you're in it for that, I can't help you. Female attraction isn't something I've researched or ever had an interest in

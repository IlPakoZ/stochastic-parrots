How can anyone sit down at a desk and stare at a computer for hours on end?
My eyes get all sore and my back and shoulders ache after 15 minutes regardless of if i am playing a gaming or working.

Get a better chair and sort your posture out. If your eyes are getting sore your monitor's brightness and contrast settings likely aren't correct.

This.

Get a chair with a straight back and adjust the tilt of the seat so its on a slight decline inward towards your ass.

Who ever invented bent seat backs is fucking retarded, they just give you lordosis.

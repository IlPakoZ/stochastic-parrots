it actually feels good having a couple hobbies and tinkering around with stuff instead of sitting on my ass.

See you in 3 years when you crash and burn miserably. No one will be free from my wrath, especially not the fr*gs. It's already beginning.

Everything I would enjoy doing requires friends, and I have none.

And I've tried going to the local hobby club, but there's never anyone there actually doing anything. They just go there to buy something then leave.

About to turn 24, in my room alone living as a NEET. I can't handle this lack of progression and loneliness anymore. I just feel like crying but that won't solve anything. How do other robots cope with this feeling on their birthday

Happy birthday fren.

I mean just pull up porn and wank until your hand goes numb. Once you are done, open good movie and eat or drink.

Play vidya and just enjoy day.

thank you for giving me hope, I've been meaning to move into a big city near me because I live in a small town and there would be better work opportunities but change is scary and hard I guess

Do you still live with your parents or are you able to get neetbux? I'd kill to be able to live by myself and not have to work (I'm a full-time wagie but couldn't afford to live anywhere).

Dude I hate myself. Quite literally have been ping ponging from right wing to left wing for the past few years. I hate it. I don't know who I am

>>73133264 (OP)
Men have grown disillusioned with society and feel as if they have no place in the world. The left wing posits that everyone has a role in society, and thus everyone becomes a faceless mass. When men try to look for support here, they are cast aside and ignored, because there are too many issues that aren't men's rights. Everyone who isn't a white man has suffered for so long, they don't want to lend support.

Right wingers identified this and have offered these young disillusioned men the safe space they so desire. Then they grow to hate the people who rejected them.
--- 73133617
Right wing values close ties. Family, friends, and to a lesser degree their community. Left wing hates family, friends, and community.
--- 73133621
>>73133264 (OP)
young black and latino men are also 'right wing', but for some reason the MSM classifies black nationalism as left wing and white nationalism as right wing.
--- 73133633
>>73133617
"left wing" values communty though im on 4chan just like you but the whole "revolution" talk is about becoming independent from big corporation and helping one and other, public food drives and take one leave one storage etc etc it wont ever happen though unfortunately

Have you ever heard the cliche, no bond is stronger than two people who hate the same person?

and pair that with feeling a sense of belonging and community its directly hard wired into our brains and has been nurtured for a gagillion years,as for why its mainly white men? I dont know probobly because muh hitler
--- 73133693
>>73133633
I haven't heard of this revolution before but many churches have food drives. Last one I went to did it every week. Current church is smaller but they still help other members in need all the time. Not sure about storage other than the rental units but there's a lot of options. These things definitely exist if you just look.

--- 73134120
The same way people get pushed to any sort of extremism be it far left or whatever. The need to be accepted, the need to not feel like an outsider, the need to not feel lonely and to have kinship with those that claim to understand you. Not feeling like a freak for the first time ever.
--- 73134123

Not exactly, they traded their actual superiority for a perceived moral superiority.

White leftists are genetic/ideological dead ends. Terminal cuckoldry.
--- 73134184

I think you are putting the cart before the horse. People simply think a certain way, hold certain beliefs and values, and prefer the company of those who agree with them.
--- 73134237
>>73134123
They hide behind the skirt tails of government because they realize their own inferiority and weakness. They fear the world but at the same time feel entitled to controlling everyone even though they can't control their own waistline. Leftists see normal people who just want to be left alone and think "there out to be a law, quick daddy government do a violence on them".

--- 73134643
>>73133633
You fell for the memes if you think it's that surface level. 

People like Chomsky or Richard Wolff or any random youtube leftoid just love to talk about "theory" or "concepts" to "justify" or "critique" things, but when you actually just ignore all that talk and focus on the things they end up supporting it's 100% of the time a regime sanctioned doctrine that's ultimatetly anti-human. The superficial excuses are just noise meant to dazzle retards.
--- 73135408
>>73134643
Most people don't describe themselves as "leftists," that's what rightoids call anyone who's not a nutjob racist and Trump worshiper these days.
--- 73135417
>>73135408
this

people group them in with the "band aids are racist because they dont have diffrent skin tones" preachers
--- 73135435
>>73135417
Ask any university student and she will agree with that statement
--- 73135444
>>73135435
of course she will as we have seen with The Third Wave experiment, its all forced posturing and cancel culture brought up by cancel culture and the fact that once your reputation or image is ruined you no longer can move comfortable within the world. It feels like theres cameras everywhere.
--- 73135471
>>73135408
Again, what they do or don't describe themselves as or say out loud is utterly meaningless. The people who shill the vax are the people who shill BLM are the people who shill socialism are the people who shill climate change are the people who shill faggotry. Everything else is just windowdressing.
--- 73135841
>>73135471
>The people who shill the vax
You think the vast majority of doctors are LGBT/BLM supporters? Are you fucking retarded, or just underage?
--- 73136020
>>73135841
Doctors went 8+ years of the educational system which itself primes them to be obedient to the status quo. As a side note the state also gave financial incentives to administer vaccinations. 

But more importantly the people who shilled for the vax were leftoids regardless of their prior medical knowledge. You're just grasping at straws.
--- 73136057
>>73136020
>the people who shilled for the vax
Just because the vast majority of anti-vaxxers are dimwitted right wingers doesn't mean the vaccines were created and distributed by "the left," you delusional moron.
--- 73136106
>>73136057
It's funny that you just can't help yourself but have to insult right wing anti-vaxxers as if we haven't been throughly vindicated. 

You're a vaxxoid shill just like every other leftoid.
--- 73136144
>>73136106
Facebook posts don't count as vindication.

But if we're talking enforcement, they're propped up by the elite and corporations your side gives tax cuts to. You just can't envision a left that's not a strawman of either liberalism or marxism.
--- 73136160
>>73136144
>But if we're talking enforcement
There's not really even any enforcement. Certain nations and private companies want proof of vaccination for you to enter their premises, which is entirely within their rights to require. The mandates these dipshits are always fearmongering about will likely never materialize, and most of the people who got the jab have already moved on with their lives.

Ahhahaha
--- 73136195
The left hates men with a passion and actively tells men to not give their opinions, laughs at men with genuinely difficult lives, advocates against most men's interests, etc. The better question is why some young men are leftists (it's because they think it will get them laid).
--- 73136214
>>73136144
>Facebook posts don't count as vindication.
So just to be clear you are ready to bite the bullet that the covid vax was a good and sound thing and that the vaccine was in fact safe and effective?
>You just can't envision a left that's not a strawman of either liberalism or marxism.
There is no strawmen. You support BLM, LGBT, feminism, the vax, ukraine, big tech censorship are pro-immigration and really 'care' about climate change. That's what you are.
>>73136160

That's why people hate you.
--- 73136250

They didnt.
There was never a "You need to be vaccinated to go to a Beyonce concert" law passed.
Its just private companies deciding to deny you service.
If someone doesnt let you into their house unless you take your shoes off thats not a "shoe taking off mandate".
--- 73136258

You're not a victim, faggot. Just an obnoxious imbecile who based his entire personal identity on nonsense.

>>73136258
Look at you pretending to be antiestablishment when you are their biggest cocksuckers. For the record Europe had government enforced mandates and you were treated like a pariah if you did not get the vaccine.

So European governments just employ weak shaming tactics instead of, you know, imprisoning people? Big if true.
--- 73136321
>>73136305
Australia imprisoned people and in Europe you were practically banned from public spaces and had to go through ridiculous hoops just to be able to continue working regularly if you weren't vaccinated. 

Gaslighting piece of shit.
--- 73136330
>Far Right
Coping Mechanism

It's all a Coping Mechanism to feel better about your own life. You know deep down you ain't better then the next man next to you going by just accomplishments. You have to attach yourself to someone that is actually superior by race proxy to feel better about your own.

>Normie Right

Huh, turns out you can simply ignore the government and there's nothing they can do about it.
--- 73136368
>>73133264 (OP)
Because far-right ideologies, unlike liberalism, actually provide a sense of meaning, moral values purportedly worth fighting for, and answers to the modern crisis.

The problem with leftism is that many people don't understand that it's always marxism. It's just disguised as "social justice" now, that's why it is called cultural marxism. But it's always political marxism in the end. The goal of it is revolution and then communism, always and everywhere. Movements like BLM don't even hide that they're marxists, and all the other woke movements, be it anti-fascism, identity, sex etc, are just bait to get more people for the revolution to come. When you understand this, you naturally become anti-left, because you don't want to live in an totalitarian communist regime like china. It's not actually a right-wing position to be anti-marxist. It's conservative and just basic reason, when you believe that freedom is an important value.
The people who are driving this culture war are not even really marxists, when you define a marxist as someone who believes all the crap about evil capitalism and workers liberation. Only the dumbest actually believe this obvious propaganda (students even more than workers). They are marxist when you, realistically, see it as a method to manipulate masses of people into a revolution to bring down the government and instal a one-party tyrany. It's seemingly the easiest way to do this, when you sell it as liberation. I don't know how so many "liberals" can be so stupid to believe this. Just ask some workers in china or north korea how it feels to be liberated.
It's now really 5 to 12. In 10 years the world could be a global totalitarian nightmare already. The revolution in the usa (called civil war by leftists) is now really a posibility, and when the usa fall, europe will fall too, and then it's just china and russia left. Then there will be no more place to hide. You will obey the communist lords or go to the gulags.

Left offers a church that has no salvation. Whites can never be equal in left society, they are eternal lessers and have permanent / original sin that can never be absolved.

Gerbert is a grifter.

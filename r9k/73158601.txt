thank you for saying this anon. i sometimes thing about it over the internet. many people we interact with on the internet aren't human. it's important we take responsability of what we say even in anonymous boards since we will be judged for that too. it's a satanic trick to make you think what you say online doesnt count. 

Laus Deo Virginique Matri

There are some things you can do to ease the pain. A change of lifestyle can go a long way. You can start by using devices less, you could try to talk to more people, go to church.
Suffering is part of life. It is the counterbalance of happiness.
Just as darkness cannot occur without first the existence of light, happiness too cannot exist without sorrow.
We must all go though hard times in life, it is part of our journey. Your problems and pains shall soon pass, I promise you. Have trust in the Lord, He has carved you the way. 
Now turn off your computer and go enjoy life, every day that you will experience is a present waiting to be opened. You are loved.
Not an angel, but someone who cares.
Peace be with you.

God always listens to your prayers. He answers them too. Sometimes you will not be ready for the answer, and that is okay. Just have faith and everything will turn out fine :)

it pains me to think of things such as this. miracles do happen though. i really wish the world was a perfect place but it just isnt. humanity is being tested. God is glory, his will is steadfast and true.

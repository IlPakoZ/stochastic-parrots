Reminder that literally ALL you need to get a gf as a guy is to just not be fat.
Seriously, I know guys who are total fucking dweebs, manlets even, and they still get attractive gfs. 
You know who doesn't gets gfs? It's literally only the fat guys. Yes, some luck out, but that's only by pure luck. Meanwhile, skinny dudes always have at least a CHANCE with just about any girl. You know why? Because the human body in its natural intended form is just inherently attractive. Sure muscles take you to the top of the pack, but as long as you have the default, you're good to go. It's literally only fat guys who are un dateable because they're inherently disgusting. Default isn't. In fact it's designed to be perfectly acceptable. 
Literally just lose weight, starve for a few weeks if you have to. You don't need any complicated workout routine. Just don't be fat.
Skinny guys have no excuse
Just be Skinny

1. You're the man. YOU talk to the woman 
2. Groom your hair

I try to talk to women, they arent willing to talk back. And obviously I do groom my hair, but I cant change shitty genetics.

i went from fat to auschwitz mode. dad had kino zygos also, so my face looked super chiselled. people kept calling me a drug addict and i went from getting 10 likes on tinder to getting 3 likes from bots. i don't know what women want, but it's not me, regardless of my shredz

Youre supposed to form a group of male friends who are slightly less autistic who then introduce the girls to you.

You cant just talk to women out of the blue unless you are some NBA star

Bullshit. Women hate skinny men. I got endless amounts of shit for being under weight lanklet my whole life. It wasn't until I hit a normal weight that I started getting treated like a person. Fat guys get way more attention than skinny. Athletic build is best but fat guy is preferred over a skinny man 10 times out of ten.

So Skinny you can see every muscle in my neck. It's really off putting even to me.

Shes confusing skinny men with tall men since there are plenty of tall lean guys.

For example, the girl in that picture is 5'8''

Bullshit women only care about money status...

Men are better trooning out than being LITERALLY FUCKIN SLAVES FOR SEX

This is true to a certain degree. My autistic ass always pulled girls that were honestly out of my league when I was younger and more round. I was fat my entire childhood and up till I was in my mid 20's. My body count was 11 before I started slimming down. I wasn't ever HUGE but I was pretty big. Although its more rare I think, some women are chubby chasers too. That being said, once I slimmed down I started noticing women paying more attention to me, flirting, etc. I don't know if this is because I was actually more attractive being slimmer, or if it was the fact that after I lost weight my confidence went up a lot and I was more out going and social and stuff. Some women really care about looks, but based on all the girls I've talked too its not the only thing they care about. Also, while being skinny is defiantly a buff to your looks, it's not everything. Based on what women have told me, they'd rather a man be slightly chubby ( the dad bod) over being rail thin and scrawny. Your best chance of success is to make an active effort to take care of yourself. You don't have to be super jacked to pull girls. Fitness isn't everything though. You need to have good hygiene habits. another important thing is that you need to be at least modestly confident. No one is going to want to be around you if you are constantly projecting your insecurities on to them. Confidence is key. Lastly, you need to be easy to talk too. Be able to carry a conversation.

I have this same experianace. Most women I've talked too dont want the really skinny emaciated looking guy, or even the turbo jacked body builder type. They want the "strongfat" or "dad bod" types most often.

I lost the genetic lottery, and my hair started thinning out by the time I was 20, and now I just shave my head bald. To my surprise I started getting more compliments with my smooth ass head then I ever got when I had hair.

if you have frizzy curly hair, anon, i could give advice.

after you get out of the shower don't use a towel, drain your hair with your hands or PAT it with a fully cotton towel. afterwards put a ton of water based gel (water based is important) and let your hair dry with the air. it'll be crunchy and gross but just take your hand and keep scrunching your hair until it's soft again.
it'll keep it from getting frizzy and you'll look more put together.
make sure to use conditioner too.

I appreciate the advice anon, but I am actually already going these things. Ive researched different ways to style my hair, but no matter what I look unkempt because it goes all over the place.

Bullshit! I'm slim, fit and good looking, but I have autism. So when women smile at me, I literally don't know what to do with my face.
--- 73022049
Im gonna get skinny, and if I get no attention just kms

I have this kind of hair, black women seemed to like it and when I was in school some non black girls found it amusing and wanted to touch it.

If I wasn't retarded I probably could have done something.

>what to do with my hair.
So long as its not an afro and you have a hairline you can do anything. In my own experience I found wearing it long like a classic rock star worked best since it would have less height than when I had it short. The length and weight of the hair holding it down.

Fellow autist here. It took me a while to learn how to best respond to stuff like this, but luckily I had that expensive "How not to act autistic therapy". Next time you are in that situation, return the smile. If you are really autistic and dont know much "emotion" to put into it... Just copy what they do. Is she just giving you a sweet little smile? Copy that. Did your sperg ass actually tell a funny joke and she's giving you a big toothy grin or laughing? You do the same!

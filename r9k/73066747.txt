Most women are straight up mentally ill. they hate their own daughters, treat their sons like babies and commit more domestic abuse against children if they aren't kept in check.

They say women are more empathic, but they see me suffering everyday and noone would even speak to me. And I don't go around spewing incel shit like this irl just regular work talk. Which leads me to believe that despite them knowing how you feel they like to see you hurt.

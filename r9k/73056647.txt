the idea of the thread is nice. but the names you chose for the archetypes suck.

They're the closest-sounding opposite-sex versions of Stacy and Chad, archetypes which are both the "alphas" of their sex, but which represent different behaviors. It popped in my mind earlier today so I jotted it down real quick for posting, without refining it much. What would you have chose?

unrelated to the topic, but this is actually a male name that women stole. just like they did many others like Ashley, Courtney, Meredith, Leslie, etc. These were all male names until Americans started giving them to women and now they're all female names.

Never knew that, besides Ashley and Leslie.
Even when I was young I had some small interest in girls who had unisex or even typically male names and could rock them like it was no big deal. There was a girl Ryan in my school, never got to know what she was about.

yeah desu I find women using male names attractive.
sadly women don't feel the same about males with unmasculine names.

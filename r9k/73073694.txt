I hate conditioning my hair, it gets way too fluffy and goes in my eyes
--- 73073703

I love conditioning mine, I love the feel of silky long hair

my moms making me cut my hair soon. I hate this life so much. I'd confront her about it but I don't want her to think I'm a faggot or something. I wish i could have long fluffy hair

>>73073707
How is she "making" you? Just say no? Alternatively I could make you a wig

>>73073811
she always says I need a haircut and pesters me about it until she assigns an appointment to get it cut and I'm a pussy and I'm too afraid to say no.

it's not like she has any power over you, right? "Nope, sorry mom you're going to have to cancel it. I said I wasn't going to go so it's your fault that the appointment had to be cancelled, not mine." No?

stop wasting hours on superficial bullshit

kill yourself, long hair looks pretty.

You're a shallow person. 
If i get a gf with long hair i'll force her to cut it down and focus on productive endevours.

>tfw you're 37 and have a full head of hair that reaches past your shoulders that waves in the wind and is pleasant to run your fingers through.
Oh how much it must suck to be such an autistic pussy faggot that you won't tell your mom to mind her own business with how you want to style yourself.

Lol what?

my preference for long hair does not make me particularly shallow. Not any more shallow than you probably are for disliking bald heads on women. I agree people should be productive. You can have long hair and be productive. It's not that hard to take care of especially if you have simple straight hair

washing, drying, conditioning, straightening etc.
>>73074991
some black women can be bald and still be very feminine and beautiful

>My shower regimen when my hair was short
10 minutes
>My shower regimen when my hair is just past my shoulders
15 minutes
I think you're just super autistic and no wonder you use terms like "IF I get a girlfriend" because we all know...You're not.

Like 20 minutes max
--- 73075056
>>73075006
it doesn't take that long and it's worth it because it looks better. Also black women with short hair don't look as good as black women with longer hair. To each their own of course, if you like short hair that's fine, but to say it is a waste of time to have longer hair is something i disagree with.

yeah same, it's a pain as a guy. i have super thick hair, and it's insane how soft and poofy my hair gets when i condition it, i have to wait like 3 or 4 days between conditionings just so my hair is reasonable most of the time
--- 73075089
>>73075061
this is optimal though. Your showers are, like, 5 minutes quicker most of the time, and your hair looks better with less effort, no?
--- 73075107
>>73075089
my showers ARE quicker because of it, probably, but i can't say my hair looks better since i don't really cut it, my hair looks like a pig's asshole atm. i typically have it shaved on the sides, zoomer style (it's actually hitler youth style but don't tell anyone), and at that point it doesn't really make a difference if i condition it or not
--- 73075124
I am so envious of thick poofy hair fags, you have it good. Be grateful your hair isnt fine and thin like mine

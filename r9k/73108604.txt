Case in point, my self.

Thick thighs, back fat and round bellies make me incredibly aroused. But that's just way too fat though, like just a pile of lumps. See I'm actually attracted to the body itself, not to some fetish involving eating or getting fat as possible.

Well, I am not attracted to the eating or getting a girl as fat as possible.
I just want her to be soft and warm, I want to lay on her belly and be given headpats.

I want to rub, fondle and caress a soft warm body all over, but also be able to wrap my arms all around her, and go places with her without her needing a mobility scooter or having to waddle like a duck to even walk.

I mean I do think think a girl with a slight waddle is really cute, and I do like how the bloated fat features look from head to toe.

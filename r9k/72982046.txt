I don't know whats wrong with me honestly, and why I'm wasting my time online when I could probably get a gf IRL, I'm just so passive and never even try.

My potential is running out. I'm not ugly by any means and people seems to like me but I just can't get out of my home without being scared. Don't even have any online friends

I wouldn't worry too much, so long as you don't lose your hair the older guy archetype can really save you from what I've heard, just stay mildly in shape and don't get unlucky with hair genetics, thats it.
--- 72982145
Yeah kind of. My peers and teaches always told me I was intelligent. But I've never felt or regarded myself as such. My teachers raelly though I could go to university. They told me my essays were PHD worthy material. But I never went. I'm too asocial. I dont get nervous or anxious I just dont have that desire to interact with people. It's probably schizoid personality disorder or something. I never thought of it as a "disorder" really until I reached adulthood and I realised just how impossible it is to make it through life if you are a self isolationist.

It's not even something thats hard to do honestly. As long as you aren't getting distracted by a million different things and take your time preparing stuff its an easy skill to pick up. And it helps divide the labor of a relationship

Mh yea true could help me gain weight I'm trying to slowly turn my life around but that's hard
--- 72982261
>>72982244
To gain weight really its mostly about overcoming your own appetite. It tough to do. Eating when you dont feel hungry that is. A good way to go about it though is just to snack on nuts and stuff often and drink milk or other ways to drink in calories.
--- 72982273
>>72982261
Ohh thx I will try that and I wanna try to workout again and do sports
--- 72982294
Never try, always play video games, always be disgusted by people IRL, never see a vagina in real life.
Easy.

I can only imagine anonette, there are a lot of not so good people out there, especially men.
--- 72982324

Gaining weight and working out at the same time is kind of hard. Just eat a lot of chicken and rice and eat some protein bars and you should be fine.

Never tell anyone that you are a KHV. Lie about having some fling in hs and you are no longer together. Admitting that you are a KHV to women that may actually be interested in you is a death sentence to whatever romantic relationship you would have had in the first place.

The problem is that I'm rapidly loosing weight. It just keeps going down
--- 72982471

That's a basic issue with mentalcels.
We are physically and intellectually gifted most of the time, but there are few foundamental screw loose or outright missing in our brains when it comes to romance.
I understand why it may seem that we simply aren't trying for someone who isn't like that.
It's on par with thinking that depression is just sadness or that apathy is just laziness.

I tried, I got a match and didn't know what to say so I deleted the app :(

--- 72984259
>>72984245
It's ok I know how you feel. Try to relax and write them if not that's ok too
--- 72984268
>>72984238
What's the part that's demoralizing? These people are on tutorial mode but are pretending they're incels. That's the opposite of demoralizing.
>>72984245
Doesn't matter if you're incredibly attractive, but if you're not, then you should learn to take good pics of yourself even if it's just 30 minutes away from your place, or at least in a well-lit area of your house.

"Making it" is gatekept by all sorts of elites. Individual accomplishment alone means relatively little if you don't have a social network to promote you.

Feel the same way, alot of my close friends men and women alike always say im really sweet, understanding, kindhearted, and funny. And yet i still find myself in unrequited love situations or in short term relationships where im broken up with. What the fuck am i doing wrong

--- 72984404

--- 72984428
>>72984268
>Doesn't matter if you're incredibly attractive
My situation is unique in that I have only gotten better looking since high school, but the attention I get from women has only ever diminished since then. 
I went from having to directly reject multiple girls in senior year while literally not showering or shaving for weeks to gymcelling then cutting for hollow cheeks in college only to be treated like a ghost. That was also around the time I found lookism. You only ever hear of people ascending in college, not descending.
Now at almost 24 years old I don't have options anymore. Covid ruined a lot of it but something shifted for me in like 2018 that I haven't recovered from since.
--- 72984460
>>72984428
Did you quote the wrong person? I don't care about any of that at all and it has nothing to do with the quote.
--- 72984497
>>72984460
Yes it does. Looks mean nothing.
--- 72984512
>>72984497
Looks aren't everything, but they're hugely important, and on dating apps especially. You'd probably have committed suicide in your teens if you were born ugly, but you're here on tutorial mode because you got a lucky die roll.
--- 72984515
>>72984404
It's not about conversations it's about what happens after.
Or rather what doesn't happen.
Like I said previously- there are gaps between have a nice talk and be in relationship.
--- 72984587
>>72984515
>there are gaps between have a nice talk and be in relationship
Okay, and girls will carry those aspects as well if you're actually attractive and have low standards.
--- 72984727
>>72984587
>Girls will-
No they won't.
I had numerous times interacted with girls seemingly with no results only to realize couple years later that she was actually expecting me to make a move.
With guys like me girls need to be blunt as a sledgehammer and realize that we may as well be aliens when it comes to romance, so first-contact tier communication is necessary- something girls are notoriously bad at doing. After all why bother with some idiot if she can few minutes later be together with some other guy who doesn't need explanation on what she considers obvious things.
Can't really blame them.

>>72982046 (OP)
When I was in elementary school, I was a total Chad and behaved like one. Everyone was a friend or wanted to be my friend and girls were interested in me even though I had no interest in girls at the time and just wanted to play video games and sports. Most women would say I was cute for a kid too and would always compliment me about how good of a kid I was and smart and etc etc. 

Then middle and high school came around and I became a manlet with really bad acne. Suddenly I had no friends because they were all hanging with their gfs and going out without me while I stayed home and played video games. Then I gained weight and went to college. Never made one friend or interacted with a woman there. Now I have a job and no friends and am a KHHV.

I peaked at 7.

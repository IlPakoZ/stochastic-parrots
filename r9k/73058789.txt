I'm going to try to talk to a girl on monday. If I pussy out I want you to hold me accountable. 
Okay?

not everyone can identify your faggotposts. so you might as well use an alias.

well I'm not going to tripfag if that's what you're asking.
you can identify me by my Ana de Armas posts

anyways, I don't know how I'm going to initiate the conversation, so I guess this thread could be a nice way to gather some ideas

Do you know her already or is it a stranger?

oh no, the idea came to me because I watched this movie The Night Clerk (2020) featuring Ana de Armas and just decided that I want to talk to a woman before it's too late and I die alone. 
this is going to take place in my college campus so I think it should be pretty easy to find one that's alone and willing to talk.

Cold approachs work best if you leave after because you aren't really friends but it's your decision.
Here is what you can do, approach calmly and say "excuse me, i just wanted to say you are absolutely beautiful" and make sure you are looking at her eyes and presenting a confident frame (just pretend it's a movie and you are acting). Since all you did so far was compliment her she will probably thank you or say something like "that's nice" or whatever.
Now depending on what she said you reply back, I'll assume she said thank you to make it easier but now you would go "you're welcome, i'm sure you hear that all the time and i was wondering if i could have your instagram", snapchat works too but i think insta is better, if she says anything else while giving you her insta (and she most likely will since she already must have plenty of thirsty dudes there) you reply while keeping it light and fun.
Here is the third and most important part! You will now ask for her name and after she replies you will tell her "nice meeting you Ana" and shake her hand and wait for 2-4 seconds max while you see if she will ask for your name back. If she does and has not mentioned a boyfriend she is interested in you and now you can try to keep talking to her for a bit more or exit and message her on insta later to plan an actual date If she doesn't ask for a name, tell her again it was nice meeting her and leave.

this doesn't sound anything like me at all, doe. also, I don't like to compliment women, they already get plenty compliments as is. anyways, my go to used to be going into interview mode:
>what's your name?
>what are you studying?
>where are you from?
and then continue from there, it's why I always struggle to talk to a girl after that initial interaction, I don't know how to start again.

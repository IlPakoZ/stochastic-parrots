>>73168809 (OP)
You okay anon? My school experience was tragic too, I don't know why normies are so mean. We don't do anything to provoke it 99% of the time it's like they can smell us somehow.

>After being put on the girls team by the coach who sucked up to the popular guys, I vowed to never do school sports again

>basically play ghostrunner on my laptop in class
>dick around in PE with a shredded dodgeball damaged from the mechanized bleachers
>teachers told me to cough up $120 for a new dodgeball set, I told them to piss off
>After graduation and never visiting the school I pondered
>Realized that it's not normal to feel like everyone hates your guts
>realized that I am not the only one who has been ostracized by my town
>Mom has met people who left the town, they endured the same shit
>realize that this is how school shooters are made
>realize that life is better now that I am out of school, slowly discover myself and who I am
>slowly learning to flirt with girls who give me signals, and that unlike what I experienced, girls showing interest isn't a convoluted bullying campaign
>Realize why I didn't want to go to college, because I can't separate education from my terrible upbringing
>Make a vow to myself when I become a father that my kids won't endure the torment, or if possible, less than what I have
>Mfw the future is brighter now that I'm out of school
>torn between becoming a coder, a mechanic, or a welder

TL;DR: I fucking hate the school system with every fiber of my being.

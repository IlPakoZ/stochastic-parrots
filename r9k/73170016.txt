I'm struggling with gaming as well. Just feels so hard to seriously invest time in a game. Used to be so easy.

At least on an annual basis, I will get the urge to devote weeks of my life to building a massive structure in minecraft. After 6-8 weeks, that autistic obsession of playing for 10+ hours every day will suddenly dissipate. Within a year, the cycle will repeat again.
But for the most part, I barely enjoy video games anymore. I find myself either browsing 4chan or bouncing around random slop on youtube, forgetting what I watched just five minutes prior. My attention span is fucked.

Find hobbies or activities besides media consumption, and then mix up the media you consume, instead of just playing video games, consume anime or movies or books or something, then gaming will be enjoyable again.

That's a blessing not a curse. Gaming is pathetic and bad for your brain and body.

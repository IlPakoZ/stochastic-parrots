god gives chad casual sex with your one-itis, because god is good
god gives chad love and a good life, because god is generous

god makes you ugly and an autistic loser, not because god is cruel, but because god loves chad more. and if you're a loser and a laughing stock for chad, it makes his life better

god is very generous to you, because he could torture you in hell, but chooses not to, because he is endlessly kind and compassionate

be grateful to god and when god gives you chad's used up hag leftovers as a girlfriend, learn to appreciate god's infinite kindness

genuine romantic love is defined by choosing you before other men by the age of 21. women give their vibrant joyful bubbly limited youth to the men they genuinely romantically love.

Everybody has their portion of suffering. Some people seem like they have a greater portion of suffering than others, but that gives them a greater understanding of life.
Life is suffering, it is not pleasure. This is why birth is a painful task, and this is why death is where all life eventually leads to
People like "chad" have a minimal understanding of life. All they know is feeling good, and it makes their head empty and devoid of any real concept of suffering.

I've had it all and it all feels meaningless, I've had teenage love in a long term relationship, I've had casual sex with multiple 18yo 9/10 girls... it isn't good for you, I've lost my capacity to love i believe, I'm hurt and I've hurt people

Chad and Stacy are suffering, they just can't show it. On vacation I met a 36yo guy at a bar in Mexico who looked as young as me (25yo) and we talked about life and shit and after a few rounds of beers he just kinda broke character and admitted that he's completely depressed and he knows fucking random young girls is getting him nowhere and he feels less and less joy from it, but he's too old for any girl wanting to settle down with him and he basically said he should've married his first gf and that he ruined his life. i already feel that way at 25 but I'm turning this franchise around, hopefully not too late

you are not a robot, and cannot feel our pain. you dont know what life is like without those things, and you actions betray your words

if they werent so meaningful and important to you, you wouldnt do it. the deception and hypocrisy of disgusting neurotypicals like you is truly endless

and yet, because you have the power to do so, god loves you and rewards you for it

only the cruel and ruthless can truly love god

"Chad" is a slang term that is sometimes used to refer to a stereotypical, attractive, and confident man who is seen as successful with women. This term is often used in a derogatory or dismissive way, and can be associated with toxic masculinity and the objectification of women.

It's important to note that using derogatory or objectifying language is not respectful or productive, and can contribute to harmful attitudes and behaviors towards others. It's important to treat others with kindness, respect, and empathy, regardless of their gender or perceived social status.

Why is it the default in your head, that if someone has more of a luxurious life than you (nfl player), fuck it it's automatically over? Or your life is suddenly miserable? That's such a dumb mindset to have. How about don't look at neither how bad nor how good anyone else has it? Or at least not give a shit?

Why are there so many balding threads? There's like 5 or 6 of them.

because balding has a hilariously potent negative impact on a guy's sexual access and relationship/romance access to women. women can't fall in love with balding men.

I don't know, I've been balding since I was 18. Never cared about it enough to even make a thread

One of a guy's biggest fear is going bald because it indicates a clear sign of aging, and many hold onto regrets that they didn't enjoy certain aspects of life with their youth.

To remind femboys and trannies of how disposable and ugly they will become in only 5-10 years

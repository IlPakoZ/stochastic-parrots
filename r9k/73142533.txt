i dont get why anyone hates reddit

>intelligent conversations on the smaller subs
>you can talk to celebrities not just AMAs i mean celebrities make accounts and just hang out in the community 
>everyone is friendly
>tons of free information

this place is just brain dead goyslop. and the best part is you all get banned from reddit you cant go 2 minutes without sperging out.

its a holdover from an era where 4chan was actually different to reddit, but 4chan's not with the zeitgeist anymore.it's become exactly what we criticized reddit for, being an echo-chamber with cuck mods. the rivalry is just that, its glorified sports teams.

what i've found with reddit lately, is that well yeah the mods are fags and the content itself is heavily curated, the comment sections are honestly pretty good. there is a noticable divide between commenters and what is actually posted. if anything, I have more interesting discussions on reddit these days.

Last time I posted on reddit I called out a fake news story. I got hundreds of downvotes and dozens of smug comments mocking me. turns out it was fake and a PR stunt. Reditors are retarded, so is the average chan poster but without the up vote downvote system you don't get the smug over confidence you find on reddit.

Sure then, reddit is great if you just avoid 95% of its content.

yes you are right stay here. once someone sits on 4chan long enough their entire brain is rotted and they can no longer talk to normal people.

That's the entire internet since 2015. Here included.

Finding something interesting or funny is like scouring the surface of the Pacific Ocean for something useful floating by.

I prefer 4chan to reddit simply because there is more open opinions and critical thought thats allowed on the platform, its upto the individual to make up their own mind on whats right and whats wrong, if you accidentally happen to troon out and get BLACKED then it was meant to be.

People on Reddit tend to insult you until they can get you to say something ban-worthy. Something like "well thats retarded" can get you banned for saying. It's just too much

For a while i had been in the depressive phase as a NEET, in the beginning it was great but turned to hopeless after a bit but now i've finally ascended to enjoying my freedom again. I made a twitter account and seeing how normies think triggered something in me to finally appreciate that i don't have to interact with these people irl. Instead i just go to the gym read and play video games all day

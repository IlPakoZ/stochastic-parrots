I like to read western comics
>oh so you like reading cucked spider-man 
and pregnant joker? You like faggot shit like I am not Starfire, too?
No I don't

I like reading manga and watching anime
>So you like goyslop like Demon Slayer, right?
I haven't read it but I've looked at other stuff

I hate these miserable people who try to lump me into 
a category for taking interest something. Just because
I love [X] thing doesn't mean I must love the bad thing
that is related to [X] thing as well.

I dont hate western comics because they are pozzed but because they are trash. No good comics except Alan Moore's works. And with that I mean mainstream kinda shit. Not obscure independent publications or euro stuff because I haven't looked into it.

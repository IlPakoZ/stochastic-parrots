What's with these journalists saying celibacy is bad, marriage is bad, and having kids is bad? It's like they hate everything that's good for society.

Well, Anon. If you had one iota of reading comprehension, then you'd realise that journalists aren't saying celibacy is bad, marriage is a shitshow, and that kids are like having unanesthetized bowel surgery. But rather, they're reporting on OTHER PEOPLE saying this. Big difference, I know.

Oh, you kids know nothing.

The most attractive men are sometimes the worst people imaginable. Doesn't matter if they're offline or online.

The female sex has this aura of beauty around it that's impossible to ignore. Women's bodies are beautiful, they tend to be creative, their posts on imageboards have a compelling, engaging quality to them. Kirst Novoselic once said of Nirvana's work "it DRAWS YOU IN, and that's what good art does." In this sense, women certainly meet the test of artistic quality; who hasn't felt himself drawn in by a woman's alluring qualities? Even gay men are drawn in by their fashion, aesthetics and social presence.
This is not to say that men can't be works of art themselves, but with men, it's more binary. A man either has the touch or he doesn't, and when he doesn't, he is a really crude, disgusting creature. Everybody has one or two male artists and thinkers they look up to, but these are individual men; with women, the grandeur applies to their sex as a whole.

Precisely. Opposite-sex attraction is the realm of brute animalistic desire. It is necessary to develop same-sex attraction to truly realize your full human potential.

It's the same thing with dogs and having kids which is why I refuse to be emotionally manipulated into pretending they actual deserve the love they get.

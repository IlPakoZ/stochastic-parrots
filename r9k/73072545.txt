The dude who basically told me I was ugly and I had a flat chest absolutely molested the shit out of me last night. He tried to tell me this shit about how he loves me and all that crap but I feel like he's just horny and doesn't know how to express himself. Or that he's just a fucking asshole for lying.

Maybe if this was a few years ago I'd have considered returning his feelings but it's too late. I know he browses here, so if you're reading this, fuck you for playing with my feelings and touching me like that. If you wanted to have something you shouldn't have treated me like shit and everytime some movie came on talking about how you want to fuck all the girl characters and how I'm ugly and I'll never get a boyfriend.

To me it sounds like he's negging you, like bringing you down so you'll seek affection and affirmation from him in return. Just don't deal with his bullshit, I guess.

Also there's nothing wrong with having a flat chest anon, I think it's cute ^_^

>even though he said he wasn't interested before
Is this the issue, or is the molestation the issue.

You can't be molested if you are 18 and older, the word you are looking for is groped/grabbed/assaulted
--- 73072702
>>73072562
Fuck you.

He learned it from anime I think. Because he never used to do it before we started watching. And after he would basically do it all the time.

>>73072605
>Is this the issue, or is the molestation the issue.
They're both an issue. We grew up together obviously. And there were times where we showed each other and touched on each other but it wasn't for very long and we never really talked about it.

After he got popular at school he basically started acting like an asshole and treating me like shit. And now after all these years he has the audacity to come back and try and do things to me??

>>73072607
He put his fingers inside me and groped my breasts. I don't know what else to call it.

Congratulations on your flat chest. I guarantee you that you will get a loving and caring boyfriend if you continue to be flat. 
>>73072702
You still care about him don't you? If he apologized and started loving you for real and treating you fairly would you be happy?
--- 73072783
not my problem, and you should not post on this board anymore.

I feel like I've heard this happening more than once. Anyways, anon, perhaps he's not the same person he once was. Have you considered the thought of breaking things off with him?

Sexual assault sounds like the most fitting description.

I hate my fucking life

I hope his pp falls off and you find a nice bf or gf

shut up whore, go kill yourself and do the world a favour.

Were you in a group together and he was the one talking down on you? There sounds to be a lot going on
>And now after all these years he has the audacity to come back and try and do things to me
I'm sorry to hear, those acts weren't out of love, but out of degeneracy. If you're truly alone to the point where him putting his hands on you is romantically bewildering to you, I hope you somehow get over the urge to win his affection and instead cease all contact with him.
--- 73072920
>>73072545 (OP)
that's terrible. i will molest your flat chest for you instead.
--- 73072936
>>73072702
hot, will you suck his dick next? swallow his cum?

No, because I don't think it would be sincere. Hes never been a touchy feely person. Or a super emotional kind of person. He acts like a fucking stone until something shakes him out of it.

>>73072793
>Have you considered the thought of breaking things off with him?
Yes

>>73072906
He would come home after school and just talk down to me and act all arrogant. I feel like we just grew apart and the brother I knew disappeared.

> If you're truly alone to the point where him putting his hands on you is romantically bewildering to you, I hope you somehow get over the urge to win his affection and instead cease all contact with him.
I think you're right, I honestly want to kill myself right now because I feel confused. But I know I can't entertain a relationship with him.

i mean this in a nice way, you really need to find a better community to share this. these fucking retards are the last people on the planet who you should open up to and half of them straight up dont even have empathy and are proud of it.

i hope youre doing alright, these replies were disgusting. which is to be expected sadly

are you virgin
how are you gonna tell future guys you lost your virginity to your brother?

I think you showing and touching upon each other is an embarrassing moment which you wouldn't tell anyone ever, and this translates to intimacy in your mind. When contrasting this behavior with him bringing you down (calling you ugly, and that you'll never get a boyfriend) you seem to think this is romantic intimacy. But it's just embarrassing degeneracy. It's better than feeling violated
>But I know I can't entertain a relationship with him.
Well, feasibility and genetics aside, you'd want to associate with people that you can be comfy with, instead of having to win their affection. Trusting them to never countersignal you or badmouth is also a pretty solid standard. Hope this somewhat helps you compartmentalize what's going on.

And with you wanting to win his affection*, that vaguely translates to romance with you wanting intimacy instead of being insulted*.

That's rape anon. You need to fight back, tell your parents and call the police. 
Call it what it is: rape.
If you do not stop this, if you do not fight back, it will continue to escalate with penis in vagina penetration. You have to stop this now.
Good luck anon.

Hey OP btw what are some of your goals? How tall are you?
--- 73073325
>>73073030
It seems like you have lingering feeling for him or something. You say that you you would have considered reciprocating years ago and your reason for not accepting him if he acted differently is that you would not believe is sincere, and not that it wouldn't be enough on its own. That's to say you're still attached to him in some way. That's not inherently wrong but it may be keeping you from cutting him off. If you thing there's no way he would truly love you then that's it, no reason to stop yourself from letting him go, at least until he is different. Communicate what your feelings are and what makes you hurt, and then get away. Also, there's no point trying to win his affection when you deserve it already
Also don't kill yourself please it would break the heart of an anon that you'll never know

Flat chest best chest. If it is just a bump like barely a-cups you have literally ideal breasts. It is almost impossible to find girls who are legal and have this, so if you are legal then props youre a gem.

how pleasureable was it for you? i know you liked it. do you hope he does it again in the coming future?

stepbrother or actual blood related brother?

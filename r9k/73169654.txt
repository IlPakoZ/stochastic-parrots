>guy accuses me of leading them on for being affectionate
yeah, that'll do it.
--- 73169669
>>73169654 (OP)
Feminine fag males needing foid friends is the problem.
--- 73169670
>>73169654 (OP)
Yeah, stop being affectionate if you don't even like me.
--- 73169676
This is entirely your fault for attracting and hanging around low-value men who will fall for even a 5/10 like yourself. What the hell do you expect by this point, dipshit? Stacies may be terrible people but at least they understand men well enough to not have these problems.
--- 73169680
yeah because you are leading them on retard. men and women can't be friends. kill yourself
--- 73169688
>>73169670
But I do genuinely like and care for you a lot, just not romantically.

>>73169676
I'm around a 7

How ugly.

I'm going through a similar thing right now!! It's pretty aggravating.

Cut it in half and add 2 rounding down is your score. Every average Becky thinks they are above average. You are top of the bell curve, kike

Typical. 
I guess a lot of dudes just fall for girls who are nice to them very easily and then their emotions leads to them intrepreting kindness as interest.

Foids like you deserve no sympathy. Get off this board. Hope you end up like Bianca devins

>>73169741
It is evidence of low T. Men dont need foid friends
--- 73169930
>>73169688
It's really hard to control my feelings for you if you act nice to me all the time, though.
--- 73169979
>>73169741
Yes because men don't get attention in general, let alone affection, if you just here to friendzone me fuck off, you're not entitled to my friendship
--- 73169982
>>73169930
I'm sorry... I just don't want to turn it off because I don't want to be cold.
--- 73170002
>>73169982
Kikes like you are the worst. At least actual Stacies dont play pretend. Beckys and femcels deserve even worse in their lives
--- 73170059
>>73169982
I understand. You're a kind person at heart with good intentions, so just cutting things off isn't your style, right? 
Maybe you can limit the frequency of interaction you have with the other person. Perhaps their feelings will slowly fade that way. When their feelings have faded away, maybe then you can start interacting with them more often.

>>73169654 (OP)
Men aren't women and you can't treat us like women and expect the same result. Affection is reserved for romantic interests. If you're not romantically interested, then stop leading them on.

It's OK, I figured out girls do this back when I was a teenager and ever since I made a point to not respond when female acquaintances at work start trying to talk to me about non-work stuff. I just nod my head and walk away to the nearest vending machine for a Coke.

This is 100000% bait, but in the tiny chance it isn't
Men don't view friendship in the way you do. Look at how a friendship between 2 men is, there's never any:
>being affectionate
Being affectionate is seen as "gay" to most straight dudes so they don't do it, the closest you'll get is a meme "nice cock bro" or a vague supportive tone but never within the same universe as saying "I love you" or "I enjoy your company" because it's assumed by the subconscious, if the guys around you don't enjoy your company they won't hang out with you, etc.
>contact a lot
Touching outside of stuff like sport, fights (fake or real, male friends can get in unironic fistfights and come out the other side as better friends) or the rare time a man is allowed to show emotions like a funeral or his own wedding and he gets an over-the-shoulder hug that lasts 2 seconds. Physical touch is an extreme rarity for men in general so the monkey brain underneath the man views it as romantic.
>being a good normal friend
This is a non-meaning buzzphrase that I can't work in, your concept of "normal friend" is on an entire different plane of reality from most mens' due to stuff like the above 2 reasons and otherwise like "being told not to show emotions" (whether by men or women).

Men act different from women and have different sensibilities, needs, and processing methods for information. The fact you even say this makes me think it's bait because it should be BLATANTLY OBVIOUS that a human being other than yourself might think differently than you, especially one that was raised in an entirely different format from you and has had next to none of the same treatment by anyone, from his parents, doctors, teachers, friends and everyone else.

Sorry, I didn't mean physical contact, I meant initiating conversations
--- 73170246
>>73170076
>affection is reserved for romantic interests
did your parents ever hug you anon
--- 73170264
>>73170246
Do you want to fuck your parents, anon? There is obvious power dynamic there, nigger unless your daddy raped you. Physical contact from someone outside your family as a man is very rare
--- 73170269
>>73170246
but my mom isn't my friend. there's a different set of rules with friends. when you're a man, you're never affectionate with your friends. it just doesn't happen. so if a woman is affectionate with you, it'll never be perceived as friendly. it's be perceived romantically.
--- 73170296
>>73169654 (OP)
guys aren't affectionate with their friends.

In my experience at least, the only reason people want to talk to you is if they want something from you, which can include romantic interest. If the conversation isn't immediately "business," examples being:
>a conversation about someone else like "I think -x person- is acting like a cunt lately, maybe we should talk to him about it"
>a conversation about/scheduling a thing like a mutual interest such as a book/show/game like "new episode of -show- is coming out next week btw" or "when are we playing -game- with the boys?"
>a question involving prior knowledge he has like "why doesn't my PC turn on?" or "what GPU should I get?"
These conversations are all short and to-the-point. Anything beyond is perceived as bizarre, which leads to it not being about "business."
If it isn't about business, that means it can only be about romance because otherwise why talk to him in particular when he knows you have other friends or people to have meaningless chit-chat with
This isn't a 100% use case of course, but lots of men (especially those here you'd be asking) have this framing to all social interactions. Talking to a man about himself only occurs on dates or in emotional contexts (which would be exclusively with his closest male friend; men don't trust women with their emotions anymore, largely due to bad experiences with them from showing vulnerability and then being seen as "less than human" even outside of romantic pursuit), which is why the implication happens.

Anyone else rarely feel the desire to meet new people? I think I could be chadlite and have friends if I actually went outside, but I never do. Does this just happen sometimes or am I conditioned by being alone for too long?

Man is immersed in the virtual reality. Friends prank him by revealing their bottoms. He's either about to get quad gassed by farts or will be in for quite the surprise upon removing the headset.

Moved to new place just before lockdowns. Lockdown isolation cut off any friendships I was starting to develop. Covid measures in bars and restaurants made meeting new people at bars or restaurants around me impossible for 6+ months after the initial lockdowns ended. Economic downturn made it so I could barely go out if I wanted to. I've fully embraced being the lone hermit in a relatively small town and don't give a shit.

10 years ago it was easier to talk to women online.
They're now pickier and harder to contact. They block almost anyone, they get messaged by guys 24/7..

I remember when I could pick up almost anyone on Interpals. Nowadays I cant even get a reply.
>"it's you, anon"
Stop. I'm using the same photo and same age just to prove it. Feels stupid proving something that should be known.

What can we do about this?

Is there hope?

Yes, this is all true and the people trying to invalidate you are either feds or retard zoomers who are attended to how things are now and assume they've always been this way.

The question is, what can we do about it?

This is a surprisingly big issue on the Internet these days
I'm 33 so I know how things used to be. Zoomies dont believe me

10 yrs ago i was in college and using OKcupid. Any girl with 90%+ match and a green rating would usually respond if I asked about one of her interests. Seems like an entirely different world. 

It's really sad that people don't use OKC anymore. The match% means people have an indication that you two are similar, and the green/yellow/red rating - which meant that people responded to over 90%/over 50%/less than 50% of messages respectively - told you if someone was worth trying to talk to. And because people care about any kind of scoring, many girls would usually respond fo all messages to keep the green rating. 

tinder blows so much ass. no match percent, no idea if the girl responds to anyone, no idea if shes even opened the app in years. bumble is similar and also seems dead, hinge is retarded and gay, all of the profile question options are such turbonormie pap. zoomers missed out, okc was the only app worth using. it still exists and theres some people on there but mostly millennials still, and they've gayed up the app with tinder-like features of course, you can no longer see all the people you have high match% in a simple list, now you have to swipe like tinder and they limit the swipes unless you pay. gay gay gay.

It's an issue with perception in general. People believe things are going on how they always have been. In a way they are correct, but in many ways they are very incorrect.

Again, the real question is what do we do about this? But you aren't thinking about that. You're thinking about how it makes you feel.

Dating apps are a fucking joke / scam.
Too bad women flock to them because women are smartphone animals.
Men follow the women.

The zoomers who are attuned to these modern times seem to believe it's a numbers game and you should go with the flow and contact as many women as physically possible since it's the only way you might trickle through.

I wont play that game though. Give it a shot.

Yeah back in 2017 i did have female friends online now it's being ignored onlyfans chicks spam and random dudes spamming women coffee emoji.

nigga thats the opposite of true. the userbases of dating apps in current year are over 95% male. women get enough random messages on normal social media that they dont need to go fishing for more, and if they want a date they can just go to a club or whatever irl. 

if you want to fuck lonely 30+ single moms then dating apps are great, but thats like the only kind of women that seems to actually use the apps.

I don't think "pickier" is the right word, it's more like one big group has ADHD and needs to be constantly entertained in relationships as though they're on tiktok, which is unrealistic so they just keep jugging guys, and the other big group, the relatively sane women, completely block all attempts of online socializing from men, especially if it's with dating in mind.

AI will fix everything, but not in an objectively good way.

True but you dont see the real issue.
The real issue is that women get enough attention on their phones that they no longer go outdoors or actively search for guys outdoors

Women have outsourced all their socializing needs on phones.

AI is control.
They're marketing it as a shiny new toy, but it's not for you. AI will bring about control and monitoring that you thought would be impossible. Even the files on your pc will be scanned daily for "security reasons".

The answer is a lot simpler than you think. If you have an instagram with 10k+ followers that looks reasonably real, you can DM women on there for dates. That's the "dating app" of current year. 

Now how do you get an instagram with 10k followers? A couple ways. The first is by running a hobby/niche account, such as one that posts like 50 funny cat pics per day. You can get followers at first by mass following random people; some will usually follow back, maybe 1% but it adds up. Then you can gradually transition to using the account for personal purposes. 

The other way is a lot faster, but harder to figure out - simply buy the followers, and buy some likes for your pictures as well. Promoters and publicists buy followers for their clients all the time, the tricky part is finding a seller who isn't a scammer. But it's doable. 

Another alternative is to use tumblr, which is experiencing a bit of a renaissance currently. It's smaller, and it will take longer to find women in your area as they may not have it in their profiles, but its a lot easier to build a following, especially as a hobby/niche/media-fanblog blog ,due to their more democratic algorithms that promote new accounts for free. Theres also a much higher followback rate, and its 95% women. There's also a lot of unironic self-identified "femcels" on tumblr kek, and its got like no moderation left. highly recommend it tbqh, fuck normie social media.

Yes of course. This is only going to continue until humans stop having sex completely because only the hottest man on earth is good enough.

youre right but they arent on dating apps. you have to go where they are.

>>72979288
You're not wrong, but I'm too old to find that method attractive. 
I'm no longer interested in social media or the Internet. It just feels stupid. The entirety of social media feels like a weird feminine construct that doesnt appeal to me in the slightest.
I just wanna talk to hot chicks IRL and bang them. But I dont even see any women in my daily life. I work from home and dont go to bars.

What was dating like in the 2000s? Do any oldfags here have experience? Was it easier for average/below men?
--- 72979424
>>72979347
That's a fallacy. It's not that you're "no longer settling for losers", you're not settling for anything.
It's no different from guys wanting a 16yo big breasted virgin pipedream. But that's not allowed and "toxic". Women cherrypicking is "empowering"

>>72979414
Yes, it was wasier.
I'm 35, incel and sexless, but when I was 15-25 I could score a date almost daily.
Then the stream of women just ended abruptly.
Didnt think to commit because I thought women would be that easy to get forever. Time machine please.

Where were you meeting them back then? Did your looks change within that time frame?

>>72978949 (OP)
The sad thing is I was too insecure to ask girls out 10 years ago. It took years to get out of my shell. I haven't had much luck either on dating apps or any other ways of meeting girls. I tried going to meetups and I don't think that's the right way to go about it.

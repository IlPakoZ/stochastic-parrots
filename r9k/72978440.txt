And just like that, POOF! Another weekend is gone. Did you have fun, or were you so tired from the workweek you slept in all weekend? Have fun at work this week, wagies! I'll be jacking off to Yu Shinoda anal creampie videos and playing Genshin while you toil away for another man's profit.

Spent all Saturday drinking, spent all of today nursing a hangover while playing Overwatch. My job is extremely non-intensive but it does suck having to be in an office in a suit for 8 hours a day pretending to work, even if I'm making more than when I had NEETbux. The hope is that I can make enough to lie flat for another few months before going back to the wagecage

Did it get any better after season 2? It was absolutely suffering.

The one day I don't work is for sleeping in and kinda wasting it. I have been keeping busy on my workdays outside of work time enjoying my free time, and now that I don't have to work, I'm going to relax and not be busy with things.

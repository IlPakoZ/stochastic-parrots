Is he one those talking while cooking some goyslop guys? Isn't that literally his gimmick to work at Taco bell?

I at least respect him a whole lot more because he moved on from pranks. Though... I do not get why he stopped the "chatting with" series like "chatting with a ketamine addict" they were very intriguing and made a lot of views. 

Either way I like humble chill vibes vlog about his shitty jobs andrew hales too

1 million+ sub counts mean much, much less than they did years ago. Not surprising at this point.

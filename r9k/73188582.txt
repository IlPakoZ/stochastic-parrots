Actual mental illness, which is very different from what the average robot experiences. Most young adults here can fix most of their issues by improving external/superficial factors (literally just go outside), whereas that wasn't the case for him.

Extremely bad depression. He was abusing shrooms daily (e.g. """microdosing""" on 2grams constantly) on the months leading up to his death, which he thought would be okay to continue forever and led him to not seek more reliable forms of help. His psuedotherapist was worse than useless in a lot of ways (refused to have him institutionalized on the days leading up to his suicide, also never got him to see a real therapist/made false promises to a person with deep abandonment issues). His brother who was basically his best friend at a young age killed himself, which tore his family structure apart and left an irreplaceable hole for everyone in the family. His mom and dad also dealt with suicidal thoughts so it's believable that he was predisposed towards depression/neuroticism. He never had real friends in the long-run. He was extremely needy and clingy which drove most of his friends away from him, so he almost always dealt with loneliness when he wasn't actively with friends. He was rich and tried almost everything to be happy and the best thing he found was shrooms.

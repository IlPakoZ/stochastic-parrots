>the women you see exposing themselves shamelessly on social media, behaving like attention seeking whores and degenerate sluts aren't an isolated case exclusive to the internet anymore. they now exist in real life and in no small numbers.

sexual relations create bonds wether you like it or not. no matter how hard you try to delude yourself. hopping from one hookup to another makes you lose your soul. especially if you're a woman.

Why you gotta post cringe here? Take it back to /pol/ with all the other tradlarpers.

If your future virgin radwife exists, i can assure you she weighs at least 140kg. Enjoy.

It's pretty bleak but the upside is we'll live in a world where you can have VR sex with all those girls from real-life who you've wanted to be with but never could be because they're out of your league, taken, or inappropriate (e.g sisters, cousins, bosses, teachers). It's obviously not the same as the real thing but it's far more than you would have ever otherwise had, and the possibilities will increase as technology improves. Combined with AI maybe you'll be able to have those pure wholesome dates that the real girl was too corrupted for too.

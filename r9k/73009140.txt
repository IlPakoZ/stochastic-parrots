Do you ever wonder what you did in a past life to deserve being born into this Hellish life of suffering, cruelty and despair? 
What do you think it was?

I don't think you have to do anything bad necessarily.
You either don't have a choice in the matter or were dumb enough to get tricked into coming back again.
Maybe the afterlife gets boring after awhile idk.

Its nothing to do with potential or waste. You were born an incel, you will die an incel. Genetics is destiny.

Do you think you get to relive lives you have already lived? Like do you think if I died tomorrow I could be go back to January 1, 2020 at Midnight with my current memories and consciousness?

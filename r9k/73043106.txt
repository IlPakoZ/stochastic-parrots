No but I'm considering it. I finished a philosophy degree lately so maybe I can try to be a lecturer at a community college or something. It's that or software. I think I'll do software at first because I'd like to try travelling in an RV while doing remote work (and it would help to build savings too), but maybe afterwards I'll give teaching a shot. 
My favorite philosopher is Heidegger, who had an affair with a 17-year-old student when he was 35.

Anon.....people notice when another person is looking at them, they always do. I learned the hard way in high school when I stared at girls all the time, and noticed them looking at me with faces of digust and horror.

I taught in Japan for 5 years. It made me real fucking uncomfortable and paranoid I'd be arrested. I was 22 in a not so well off school with kids who had less inhibition shall we say. I had lots of them looking at me, some flirted, 1 straight up asked me to date her and 2 others asked me to date once they'd graduated. I was expecting a knock on the door any moment, shit was terrifying.
--- 73044803
>>73044678
It's natural to like cute, fresh, energetic girls, regardless of who you are. 
At least a majority of the male population (as well as a significant percentage of the female one, honestly) would pretend that there aren't a lot of fucking hot lolis but melt at the sight of a teenage goddess.
--- 73044815

Does anyone even really give a shit about the age discrepancy over in Japan, as opposed to the racial or caste difference of a white English teacher doing something to a nip maiden? 

I think the idea that every guy who acknowledges that a young girl can be attractive is a vicious, deadly grooming rapist is a uniquely American idea invented by the intelligence agencies so they can kidnap children and sell them to billionaires while cherry-picking the fattest losers to prosecute and hang on a cross as public amusement.

It's normal, natural, and a problem for the orderly machinations of a global capitalist system, so you must be punished for so much as glancing at the absolute zone of a fertile beauty, as defined by the sagacious loliwizard Konata Izumi.
--- 73044912
>>73044868
Thanks anon, makes me feel a little better about obsessing over a teenage girl who's supposed to be one of my students.
--- 73044954
>>73044815
When they are 13 to 16 yes it is because at the end of the day Japan has sham courts. They just have to suspect you touched a student and you'll be locked up guaranteed because you're foreign and thus evil. Japan is a paradise compared to the west but it's a lot more fucked up then people realise. During my time there I had 2 suicides and one attempted from my students, the music teacher (japanese guy) got caught pressuring student into sex and fucking them so he got locked up and I had a bunch of the kids always flirting or trying to touch.

>>73044818
I fucked 2 of them on the regular but they weren't students at that point and were 18. One of them I bumped into working at a bar and the other one was a returning student who came to the night school I worked for. Those two I could get away with but anything else? Fuck that I'm not going to a Japanese prison. The mom's though. I don't know how many of those I had.

Amazing taste, anon, but I mostly just get drunk and high all day and shitpost while jerking off to loli hentai at night to sleep. Hopefully, this will magically lead to some form of happiness rather than consolation.
--- 73045185
I used to work in a youth ministry and the girl thing is true, honestly it was very dangerous. They lack any sense of self control, consider you a prize because you're a grown adult and they have no reference point other than their fathers, they assume you would feel better than boys their age, and they typically romanticize you.

I swear to the god I don't believe in, this is for you FBI agent, I DID NOTHING. But I definitely could have if I was a moron, which I am not.

--- 73045332
>>73045185
Thabk you. That is exactly what it was like in Japan. They see you as a kind of prize and they think that if they can bag you it means they are mature and grown up. I've had one of those 14 year old grab me and hug me and say she loved me. I'm noping out of any situation like that. They are cute as fuck but not worth 10 to 20 in a Japanese prison.
--- 73045399
>>73045259
your behavior is why society tries to keep men away from caregiver roles

>>73045332
Yeah they're 100% hunting you. Female attraction looks at the full package. What you look like, your status, what you can give them, how you can make them feel, etc. So when teenage girls see a 20-something year old man they're looking at everything that 20-something year old man could make them. They probably assume that you're constantly on crazy adventures, at parties, or whatever. Plus then they can be the girl that pulled it off. Everyone would know that she's the one that's special enough for adults.

Another situation is if you're able to speak with them about personal issues. Very few adults give adolescents any time to express their feelings and then answer those feelings with respect. Just a few honest conversations where you treat them like an actual human with real thoughts and they view you as a savior. That was a common issue for me, especially because being available as support was part of the job description.

I had some really difficult situations because of it. Girls in churches are expected to be married with children by 20. To them it's normal to try and hook a reliable man early.

Teaching in 2023 is one of the worst jobs imaginable. It pays like ass, there are no more snow days off or breaks off and everything is on zoom or microsoft teams now and the students are subhuman.

Try doing crack on the job and see how long they want to keep you around. Also say you like Hitler and watch as in seconds your job becomes nonexistent.

>>73043106 (OP)
what cunt, OP? my plan, if all else fails, is to go teach (for non-perverse reasons) english since that is the only thing i am good at, in a european country that isn't the UK obviously (unless they need english teachers in ireland for people who only speak irish? I don't think that's a thing though)

I've unironically considered going to japan but japanese is fucking hard and I would have to consider getting a jap wife if I would be moving there to teach. I'm not that handsome and am a dark featured germoid so I would look like just another gook in the crowd and be a ricecel by association

also, a little unrelated - i dunno what it is but even though i had a shit experience in school, it is like there is this longing to still be there. like a longing for closure. i want to have a good school experience. is that bad? it's not like i wouldn't be a good teacher or wouldn't care about the kids. i'm a pretty nurturing person. it's just that, what can you do if you are trapped in an ugly, dirty building with kids that don't want to learn and actively hinder any that do with their every action, and a school that has no money? it's pretty depressing and it's going to be like that regardless of me being there or not. that was my experience in school. surrounded by niggers, literally failing classes that I attended all year and did work for because teachers could not take attendance properly in the chaos.
--- 73045975
>>73045920
You're so fucking dumb that you couldn't pass a class full of disruptive, braindead negros?

I find it hard to believe you could handle being in an actual society that requires some basic level of mental competence. I have no doubt your home country was too busy rolling its eyes at you to take your pitiful goblin ass seriously.

Fuck off and die, faggot.
--- 73046021
>>73043106 (OP)
You get paid like shit and the students don't respect you, though. Also,
>sexual tension
If you want to get fucking fired, sure. This also doesn't even remotely apply for something like middle school/elementary. That being said, subbing hasn't been as awful as I've expected it to be. I'm kinda locked into being a teacher due to a combo of cheating through college and useless degree (math). So I hope it's not as awful as people are saying.
Glorified babysitting isn't exactly the job description either, as you're supposed to teach the students and make sure they are learning. You don't get tested annually as a babysitter.
--- 73046024
>>73045920
OP - i'm a bong, and there's very few irish people who don't speak english.

I went into this job for non-perverse reasons also, mostly because I was never gonna get a job related to my degree and because I wanted the extra holidays. Being surrounded by forbidden cuties is just a bonus.

Just make sure you research whatever school you want to work at. Get a teaching qualification and some experience working with children, make sure it's what you want. When you experience education from the other end, you'll see very quickly that what seemed important at 16 was actually meaningless, so if you want closure on your own school experience, you might find it. Just don't expect the kids to understand the value of education or any bullshit like that.

>you get paid like shit
Yeah you won't be making the same as an engineer or a doctor, sorry to break it to you. It's kind of the tradeoff of a job that requires relatively few actual skills and which gives you months of paid leave every year.
>students don't respect you
Actual warning - if you can't get their respect then leave. Get another career. Don't be the poor loser getting punked by his students on a regular basis. Become a rent boy or something less degrading.
>if you want to get fucking fired
If you teach highschool, are young, and a dude I guarantee you will be getting eyefucked regularly, teenage girls are the horniest brats on the planet. Remember it's not your fault and ignore it (or get high off it if you're like me)
>you're supposed to teach the students and make sure they are learning

I'm OP, and yeah that would explain a lot. If you're a sub you're not gonna get much respect since you're just some literally who that walked in the front door. When you have your own classes they will warm to you pretty quickly, teenagers are surprisingly deferential to adults they see regularly.

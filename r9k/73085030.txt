Where does anti-booba hatred come from? Straight men don't hate tits, I don't think gay men have any specific hatred of tits either. Do women hate tits?

It's just typical normie mainstreamers masquerading as counter culture. Normies love to larp as being counter culture when in reality they are part of the mainstream.

The weird overlap of sex negative feminism and religious conservatives.
It's a strange bedfellows situation.
For example if you look at shit complaining about objectification you will likely find feminist rants and content put out by religious folks in equal amounts.

What it comes down to is both groups fear and seek to have absolute control over male sexuality as a means to control men and culture in general for their own purposes and ideology.

For the feminist it's using that power and control to get men to build their feminist lead socialist utopia for them somehow.
For the religious nuts it's a lot more simple, it's control male sexuality to only be expressed in ways that are officially arbitrated and approved of by the religious organization such as through marriage. Only through formal approval and total submission to the organization is any sort of pleasure not a sin.

Power and control dude. Power and control.

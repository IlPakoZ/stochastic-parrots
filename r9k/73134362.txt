>everyone who i thought was a friend was lying the entire time
--- 73134367
I figured that out around this time last year. All of my 'friends' wold only ever hang out with me if we did whatever they wanted. I was essentially a tag along to their friendgroup.
--- 73134379
Normies live a boring shitty life, better off without them
--- 73134399
>>73134362 (OP)
the same ones you ghosted?
--- 73134411
>>73134379
thats true, but still i hate being insulted and laughed at
>>73134367
yeah for me its only online friends, but they just use me for validation and then be mean to me behind my back. people are just not good
--- 73134424
>>73134399
i didnt ghost , i just got busy
--- 73134501
Still too busy?
--- 73134515
>>73134501
not at the moment 
why?
--- 73134523
>>73134515
Because you seem to want friends and we could give it a shot.
--- 73134527
>>73134424
no no, the same ones you admittedly ghosted, because you were scared of messaging them after not talking to them for a while. did you know that friendships go both ways? did you know that even when you are busy you can drop a "hi, how are you?" well, i guess you know this already, but stop playing the victim. your self pity is going to get you nowhere.
i mean, it doesn't matter. you already

morning, iris. what'd you do on your vacation so far and what are you going to do today?
--- 73134572
>>73134527
well its not like i got close with anyone and suddenly ghosted. and the people im complaining about in op are not from discord but from here
>>73134523
sorry, i dont want close friends anymore. i would play vidya with you if we had any similar ones, or be friends on just this board. i just dont really want to try to get to know anyone closely anymore
--- 73134607
>>73134572
I mean, we can do whatever you want.
--- 73134620
>>73134544
good morning, we haven't been super busy, just sightseeing around the area and today we're going out for lunch. cant give too much detail on here anymore unfortunately . hows your morning going? got any plans for today?
--- 73134634
>>73134607
what do you like to do? any favourite vidya? where are you from?
--- 73134640
>>73134362 (OP)
Too much victim mentality
--- 73134645
>>73134634
It depends. I like playing music, I like playing games, I'm currently on a weight lifting kick. Favorite all-time or jus favorite current? I'm from the US! How about yourself?
--- 73134648
>>73134640
yes
thats true. but its only lately, something in the air here is messing with my head
--- 73134689
>>73134648
>its only lately
Debatable
--- 73134702
>>73134620
>we haven't been super busy, just sightseeing around the area and today we're going out for lunch
make sure to take a ton of scenery pics, you'll cherish them later in life (i think). speaking of pics, the ones you choose to attach to your posts are getting better
>cant give too much detail on here anymore unfortunately
yeah don't go doxxing yourself again 
>hows your morning going? got any plans for today?
it's 2 a.m so i should be sleeping but i'm planning to visit some family members around noon
--- 73134719
Your problem was always being too nice and naive, iris. You learned your lesson too little too late, reputation really matters
--- 73134783
>>73134645
oh what instrument do you play? thats cool. and yes favourite current. my favourite games atm are divinity original sin 2, for honor, rimworld, and just started playing darkest dungeon. 
>>73134689
i hadnt been complaining on here for months, but now im in a uncomfy position away from home and its making me insufferable
--- 73134798
>>73134783
Basically any derivative of guitar. Guitar, bass, banjo, mandolin, etc... I don't know what my favorite current game is, I mostly just like something I can play with others. Realistically, I'd try anything if I knew someone wanted me to try it.
--- 73134804
>>73134702
thanks desu, i have been taking lots of pics, the scenery here is very nice at least. 
>speaking of pics, the ones you choose to attach to your posts are getting better
thanks :)
>but i'm planning to visit some family members around noon
nice, are you guys doing anything or just hanging at their house
>>73134719
whats wrong with my reputation?
--- 73134824
>>73134362 (OP)
You get used to it eventually and just stop caring about people.
--- 73134839
>>73134798
oh wow, even banjo? and do you have any preffered genres of games?
--- 73134857
>>73134839
Even banjo. I have no preferences. If I HAD to pick one, I'm old school and like turn based RPG 's.
--- 73134869
>>73134804
>are you guys doing anything or just hanging at their house
just hoping to get some face-to-face social interaction out of it not sure if we are gonna do anything special yet
--- 73134883
>>73134857
wow! ive been just getting into turn based rpgs lately and i really love them. would you wanna play wasteland 3
>>73134869
i see, well i hope you have a nice time there. you should get some sleep soon though.
--- 73134915
>>73134883
I absolutely love to play Wasteland 3 with you. 

For reference, I have no idea who you are. I see people talking about your "reputation" and whatever and I just want you to know I have no expectations of you or anything.
--- 73134945
>>73134915
do you have a discord? im on a family vacation right now but once im home id really like to. i played through it once before, but ive been wanting to do a new campaign with different people/choices for a while now. also maybe getting the dlc expansion and playing that, but if youd prefer just the base game thats cool too
--- 73134967
>>73134883
>i see, well i hope you have a nice time there
it's probably gonna be super awkward as always cause i'm not really close to them or anyone but I figured that isolation is bad and as good as online interactions are, they only go so far
>you should get some sleep soon though
yeah sure thing MOm ttyl
--- 73135028
>>73134945
I do! Would you like to screen me first to make sure I'm worthy of having yours? Realistically, if we got into it I'm going to go all in. I'm probably autistic and am a huge completionist.
--- 73135132
what heinous crime did you commit lmao
--- 73136042
emergency bump im going to reply
--- 73136068
>>73134967

>>73135028
screen how? you seem nice desu, i could post mine if you don't want yours posted though. also sorry for the late reply, hope youre still here.
--- 73136077
>>73136068

--- 73136084
Where do you find your cute anime images from Iris?
--- 73136127
>>73134362 (OP)
What's your time zone? If it's not too big a difference I'll be your fren, genuinely offering.
--- 73136198

>is it your immediate family?
yeah. i can barely relate to them but at least they let me be around them i guess
--- 73137783
>>73136068
>>73137748
btw what's your family like?
--- 73137824
Well then, what you do is go up to the biggest asshole of them all, while the his other little buddies are around, and punch him full power in the face. They'll still hate you, but at least now they'll fear and respect you, and that's something.

PS if you're afraid of a group beatdown, that's where a 'stabby surprise' comes in. Nothing like getting an icepick to a vital spot to make the good times roll, so to speak. "Self-defense, yer honor"
--- 73138036
If Iris did OF, how many people from here would actually pay? I would pay at least one thousand dollars for customs

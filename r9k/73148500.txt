Don't worry about it, frogposter

I assume that she doesn't like me and is just being nice
statistically this is almost always going to be correct

But if she doesn't (which is most likely) then she will think I'm a weirdo and ignore me. Maybe the best I can hope for is to be friends
>>73148519
You're right, for me it would probably be the case most of the time

If you have to ask, she's probably just being nice.
You think they give Chad only vague ambiguous clues?

I doubt all women are that confident, especially if they're not Stacies. Though I wouldn't be surprised if Chad still goes for her. Oh well.

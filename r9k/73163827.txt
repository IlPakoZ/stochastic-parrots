this is genuinely insane to me, I don't even KNOW that many people. 
And people still have the audacity to say femcels are real.

This applies to all unattractive girls and average girls. Usually it's the hottest women who aren't whores because they don't need validation as much. They get it all the time from orbitors, friends, guys approaching them irl, etc. They aren't insecure so they don't cope with stranger sex to validate themselves.

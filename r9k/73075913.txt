Good morning wagie. It's Monday so you know what that means, right? It's time for you to go to work! Come on, get up! My NEETbux aren't going to earn themselves!
Another day, another dollar!

Surreal seeing this as my mom just left for work and I know I'm just going to spend the day being high and throwing out job applications half heartedly

Enjoy the NEET life while you can before one of those applications stick

No can do! Taking orders is your job, I wouldn't be a comfy NEET otherwise. Now hurry along before you're late for work!

Wrong wageslave, wrong! I make NEETbux off your hard earned tax dollars. I guess in a way you slave the day away for my well being... you work for me, wagie! Thanks! Now I have all the time in the world to do as I wish! And right now I wish to go bird watching, so if you'll excuse me... uh but you have fun at work with Mr.Shekelstein!

I make 1k euros a month by saying I'm too autistic to work. I have a friend in my home country getting all the money in cash and putting it on another account so that the IRS of my country can't see shit. With this money I live like a king in a shithole.
Now go to work slaves.

I don't work at Shekelsein's and Sons anymore, you didn't hear? They had to downsize last year. Now, I'm running my own business. We've already begun to turn a profit.
Enjoy your half a load of groceries a month, though.

thanks anon. usually I can get away with the NEET life for a couple months before it starts becoming a problem with the family. the market is shit now and even the places my family works at aren't hiring, asked them if they could help out. they told me not to worry about it because there isn't much I can do at the moment. but I'm still applying, just got done with my usual morning routine of smoking a fat doob and throwing out resumes online. 

wagie life is miserable, either way I'm still going to be a low-status virgin without any way to buy a modest home, so I will just keep being a transient NEET for as long as I can get away with. because these employers are terrible and will only pay enough for you to eat something and wipe your ass so you can continue working, which was what I did for the last two years when I was living alone paying high ass rent to some shitty cheap chink landlord who never fixed the rat infestation in the apartment. living alone is way too expensive and people treat you like downright shit for existing because they need some low-status broken self-esteem punching-bag to make their shift go faster. when the supervisor, team lead and manager talk to you like you're retarded and spread horrible rumors about you, it tends to make you not want to work and leave these shitty jobs because normies love talking shit. Over the years I've been getting more fed up and less impervious to dealing with random bullshit from assholes, and in reality most people are assholes. women, men, doesn't matter. the women are assholes because they hate the men who fuck them and leave their lives a mess, the men are assholes to other men so they can look good in front of the women. and I don't even have the excuse of autism, I'm just below average. imagine how they treat autists who never had a job.

Good morning my fellow neets. Today I will drink beer, watch anime, make burritos &amp; chocolate pastries, plant my azealias, and do some light housework. Man it feels good to do whatever I want . So glad I come from wealth and my parents pay my rent and I don't have to do anything except exist

I am pretty sure we have gotten to the point that most porn users are not at all against pot or other recreational drugs. Everyone used to shit on druggies on here but now it has died down a lot. Maybe the social weirds actually gatherered enough balls to ask for a blunt.

Any anons who both took drugs and consumed pornography can confirm this? Do they have the same effects and cause the same addictions?

There's nothing wrong with anything. The problem is addiction.

I think my parents are fully aware I'm depressed and mutually, we are afraid to talk about it.

They've been checking on me all the time recently; they sometimes panic when I don't answer the door or respond to their texts.

Their concern makes me feel guilty over my suicidal thoughts. I sometimes wonder to myself: would I be brave enough to carry through if I lived alone? I'm still a pussy regardless and always have been, especially when it comes to blowing apart my brain.

It's ok anon, it's not about being brave or a coward is just that you don't want to die
But neither to keep living the way things are
They seem to want to help, maybe you should talk to them a little and get to a psych or therapist

I think its worth reaching out to them an being honest with how you're feeling. There is no shame in the emotions you're experiencing and talking openly about them with others may even help to alleviate some of what you're feeling anon. Just getting it off your chest and not letting it bottle up inside you is the best thing to do.

You're probably all on the spectrum. You need to force yourselves to talk to each other.

just talk to them. you don't have to talk about your mental health issues but it would probably make them feel more at ease

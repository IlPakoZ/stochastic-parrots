Why are we not allowed to make threads documenting our suicide here? If we're just doing it in our house and not harming anyone. I know literally nobody and I don't want to be completely alone as I go out.

it's a boring and depressing topic

Because your shitty family would use Jew lawyers to capitalize on their feigned "heartbreak" by suing 4chan. This has happened to facebook several times.

do mods ever take down threads for that? i thought that was just one of those rules that everyone ignored

it's a domino effect. reading threads about people killing themselves makes people like you more likely to go through with it.

also even if you did post it you would still be completely alone as you go out.

A lot of the topics here are boring and depressing and they don't get taken down

would this not be good though if you really consider it? Most people who want to commit suicide do not turn their lives around. This could really benefit society if we encouraged suicide

who knows? I'm not an expert in psychology or economics. I won't pretend to make some grandiose calculated claim on what is the optimal way to handle it.

All I know for sure is that, for better or worse, the general consensus around suicide is that it should be prevented.

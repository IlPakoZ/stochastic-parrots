I don't know what to think about this. I don't give a fuck about gays or lesbos because I associate that as mutations, but trans comes across as some weird ass jewish psyops that cane out of nowhere. Like there were always mentally ill people, but now the media and businesses keep pushing this shit out of nowhere for no fucking reason other than the puppet master oligarchs giving them the green light. 

This is the weirdest psyops ever.
--- 73056356
tell her to stop or you're a cuck.
--- 73056391
>>73056339 (OP)
trannies never really bothered anyone till the jews made it mainstream, now kids are trooning out all over the place.
--- 73056411
>>73056391
Yep. Only question is why are the jews pushing this shit now?
--- 73056426
>>73056339 (OP)
if it bothers you that much just break up with her? I fail to see how this impacts your relationship at all. Surely you must disagree on other topics too?
--- 73056459
>>73056339 (OP)
Trans being a jewish psyop is infact a psyop. I know plenty of normal trans people. Yes, there are crazy schizoids, same for literally every group.
--- 73056481
>>73056411
they are evil so who knows
--- 73056482
>>73056459
No, here's the thing that's weird. They've always existed, but only NOW are the jews pushing it down everyone's throats. Ever since like a year into covid or some shit like that. Like it's part of the reset. For what purpose? Idk
--- 73056492
>>73056482
Yup. But whatever the psyop is, I'm not going to start hating a group of people because the media is pushing them. Not even they appreciate that. They KNOW it looks bad.

>has gf
GET OUT. GET OUT OF MY FACE YOU HUMBLE BRAGGER FAGGOT
--- 73056503
just wait till see shes one in a female only space such a girl's bathroom. Most females support trannies because it's the woke/popular thing to do, until they get a taste of what they are in reality.
--- 73056512
>>73056503
A woman is more likely to get raped by her priest, schoolteacher, direct superior or a cop before a tranny.
--- 73056530
>>73056512
>Im trans and a manlet btw idk if that matters!
--- 73056535
>>73056512

I never said she would get raped, but when there's a 200lb dude in a dress with a 5 o'clock shadow using the bathroom in the stall next to her, then she might rethink her position.
--- 73056554
>>73056535
Trans people are less than 0.2% of the population. I don't think that the majority of them are nearly as disgusting as you may think...

However, even if they are, consider this:

>trans become more accepted
>trans then have room to push out larpers and transtrenders from their ranks

Sounds good to me.
--- 73056566
>>73056512
>please let me go in the bathroom with you to sniff your farts and watch you through the holes in the stalls 
>oh don't worry. Even if there will be more sexual assault, it won't go up by THAT much.. I think. Like who cares if it goes up though? There are worse things in life!
--- 73056576
>>73056535
Good thing not all trannies are giga rapehons, and even then, do you really think someone'd go through all that effort just to rape a girl? As if that'd even let you get away with it, what a sad life you must live if you're constantly plagued by these delusions.
--- 73056579
>>73056554

according to them my physical appearance doesn't matter and I can change my gender identity any time I want. So by that logic, me a male who presents as male, can just say I'm a female and walk right into the girl's bathroom and they are bigots if they complain.
--- 73056598
>>73056554
>I don't think that the majority of them are nearly as disgusting as you may think...
They all look disgusting. Like cross dressers. Worse yet you will get posers entering the bathroom because people with fetishes are a thing
--- 73056606
>>73056576
>do you really think someone'd go through all that effort just to rape
Obviously yes. The lower the barrier to entry, the higher the numbers will go. That goes for all things in life. For instance if a job has a high barrier to entry, you'll get less applicants. Low barrier to entry? More applicants. It's a numbers game
--- 73056615
>>73056554
How does being a small part of the population have to do with whether someone is disgusting or not? It's like you took the first part of some pre-memorized talking point (trannies aren't gonna rape you) and then continued into the rest of your response.

Also, yes, trannies really are that disgusting. And ywnbaw.
--- 73056634
>>73056606
Let me rephrase, do you really think someone would go through 6 months worth of psychological screening at the very least, and then drastically alter their body permanently, just to rape people? Are you out of your fucking mind?
--- 73056654
>>73056634

what about people who make no effort to transition but call themselves trans? Should they be allowed into female only spaces?
--- 73056712
>>73056654
No, then they aren't trans and don't get to access female only spaces, but how would you determine whether they are putting in effort or not? Because unironically there's lots of extremely ugly trannies out there who still put up with hormones, therapy and having to walk outside every single day with such a huge target on their back.
--- 73056726
>>73056339 (OP)
Dump her, and find a nice skinhead girl to shack up with
--- 73056766
>>73056634
Again, the answer is yes because you're lowering the barrier to entry needed to enter a woman's bathroom. Again, it's a numbers game. Yes, you'll get a few going through the cracks
--- 73056811
>>73056766
Do you realize that a man can just enter the women's bathroom and rape someone? God it feels like i am talking to npcs, it literally happens all the time, how are you lowering the barrier of entry when you are requiring someone to go through a lenghty psychological screening and permanently alter their body? And if you think this is really true, then where are all the cases of women being raped in bathrooms by trannies?
--- 73056836
>>73056811
>Do you realize that a man can just enter the women's bathroom and rape someone? God it feels like i am talking to npcs
you're fucking stupid. The moment that happens, you'd get a flock of people going "what the fuck" and putting a stop to it. If you normalize it, you'll see an increase in creeps. It's not complicated
--- 73056868
>>73056836
You are an actual npc, normalize what? People raping women? What makes you think that anyone could get away with raping a woman in the women's restroom? Trans or male or even female they'd still get arrested for doing that, what the fuck are you on about?
--- 73056883
>>73056868
I already explained it. Try reading again. And also on top of rapes, you'll also get a shit ton more creeps peeping through the stalls
--- 73056942
>>73056391
>Former repressors are coming out 
Oh no, what will happen next to the gaussian distribution curve?
--- 73056958
>>73056883
What counts as creeps? Anyone you find ugly? I have already addressed your complain, the moment any tranny rapes a woman in the bathrooms people would still go "What the fuck", if a tranny did that so much worse'd happen considering people have been pushing the groomer and rapist thing for a while by now, so i'm gonna ask you again, where are all the fucking women being raped by trannies? Where are they?

The average chick doesn't want some ugly fuck peeping through stalls LMAO. It's not rocket science
--- 73056998

Most ftm trannies are into men, though.
--- 73057003
>>73056986
How about all the retarded propaganda in schools about gender fluidity (books in the library and pushed by instructors too and yes). When I was a kid, my life was friends, school, and cartoons. Not being force fed this retarded sexuality crap. Also companies now have more than 2 options for what "gender you are" which is fucking retarded
--- 73057008
>>73056998

in this case a tranny going into a female bathroom would be a MTF.
--- 73057010
>>73056986
>treat people with decency even if they don't fit in traditional gender roles?
If they are fetishists in public spaces, you shouldn't.
--- 73057014
>>73056998
Again you'll get posers and not all are into men either. They are peak degenerates and you're going to see an uptick in sexual harassment by the trans community.
--- 73057018
>being trans came out of no where
>Gay people always existed
Yeah it's almost like the option to transition only recently came out. 
People have been wearing the clothing of the opposite sex for millennia
--- 73057022
>>73056988
Who cares? I also don't like looking at ugly men when i go to the bathroom, and yet they're still men that need to piss just like i do, so your entire argument literally revolves around feelings, "Oh but think of the women, having to see such creeps (Ugly trannies) when they'll go to the bathroom) that HAS never been a good reason to prevent someone from accessing their specific restroom.

You have 1 more reply to prove me you aren't clinically braindead, so use it well.
--- 73057077
>>73057048
>Not even one should exist in a school setting.
Of course they should. Trans children do exist. It's a topic that should be brought to light. 
You wanting to burry the subject underground is part of the problem. It's pure censorship and a hate crime against trannies. 
You want to invalidate the existence of queer children and their right to an inclusive education.
--- 73057091

That sounds pretty anecdotal and generalizing.

You were groomed by church into hating minorities
--- 73057107
>>73057048
So telling kids to respect trannies is grooming
But taking kids to church and teaching them to hate trannies is religious freedom and education?

Gender fluidity isn't even a real thing. It's propaganda garbage. From a scientific standpoint you are either male or female. Fake science doesn't belong in a school's library. 
>>73057070
You ranted a lot but you know I'm right
>>73057077
No, retard. The more it's pushed, the more people get brainwashed. You get people that would have been normal "transition" because society told them "transitioning is normal". Propaganda 101
>>73057091
It is anecdotal. My whole point is the more it gets pushed, the more cases you'll see. Numbers game
--- 73057134
>>73057107

Telling them gender fluidity is a thing, trying to force this sexual shit into their heads, and exposing them to degeneracy is indeed grooming

No, retard. The more it's normalized, the more closeted repressed queers will come out. 
Remember when left handedness was considered a sin and strictly forbidden by church?
Remember how left handed children were forced to conform to right handedness? 
Remember when we normalized being left handed, and everyone became left handed? Oh that's right... They didn't.

The real experience of a trans child is much less accepting, unfortunately. It's more like society telling them: we hate you please die

except left handedness is genetic but LGBT comes from abuse or early exposure to sex.
--- 73057219
>>73057127
>he more it gets pushed, the more cases you'll see
The more it gets normalized, the more closeted repressed trannies will come to the light. 
In the end the number of trannies remain the same. The only difference is that they'll stop hiding, and that's what you don't like. 
You want trannies hiding in the shadows

There's nothing being forced into their hands. Queer children exist spontaneously, just like straight children, and they'll approach these subjects spontaneously with or without educational support. 
Education prevents bigotry and hatred from spreading. 
You just invalidate the existence of queer children and the struggles they face with bullying and discrimination inside schools

LMFAOOOOO no it's not, you fucking moron. BEST case scenario it's probably a result of mutations aka fucked coding. What's happening now is propaganda being force fed into people to normalize it which gets people that would have been normal to become degenerates. Mutations aren't exactly "natural" either. They are literal coding errors. It's literally a bugged person. 
>and yet it's fine if a pedo priest diddles a kid because god intended man and woman to be together, 
I'm not catholic, lmao. Also very disingenuous.

No, pushing this shit is retarded. Exposure as an adult? Sure, I don't care, but for those growing up? Literal grooming.

I have, just look at you. A prime example of conservative grooming and hate propaganda taking its roots on a teenager. 
If you could change a person's gender identity through force, there wouldn't be any trannies at all. The sheer amount of heterosexual propaganda we are exposed to in our daily lives would have changed them.

Incorrect. Gays are technically not natural. They are a result of mutations. A result of fucked coding in their DNA. It's like when people are born with skin that is inside out. Is that "natural"? No. That's fucked coding that did that to them.

My hatred stems from groomers and propaganda lovers. When I was a kid, do you think I hated anyone? No. I was watching cartoons or playing with friends. I was being a kid. Nowadays? Kids are being force fed stupid shit. That's wrong. That's grooming. That's propaganda.

So how did you turn to be so full of hatred towards anything you can't understand? You were groomed your entire life and told that a man should be with a woman because don't question it ok? Sky daddy said so, kids aren't being groomed into being gay or trans because it's literally impossible to turn someone gay or trans, you have to be born that way, they are merely being told that those people exist, it's so fucking important to do that, so that they don't grow up to be full of hatred towards anyone that doesn't conform, like you turned up to be.

Not propaganda because we in fact were created by a God. For instance, 26 universal constants needed for life destroy atheism. Just to give atheists a fast example, one of the constants deals with nuclear force. Too weak = universe would only have hydrogen. Too strong = universe would only have heavy elements. In other words even with INFINITE time and dumb luck, you STILL wouldn't be able to create life aka not even a single celled organism because you literally wouldn't have the proper materials to work with.

Why shouldn't they be allowed to adopt children? Trannies are unironically a godsend for kids, because they obviously cannot have biological kids, so they are forced into adoption, instead of putting more people into this world, they adopt the ones that would have otherwise be condemned to a miserable life in an orphanage, i actually know a trans woman irl who did that, it's very wholesome, kids don't give a fuck if their parents are cis or trans, they just want to have the life any other normal kid should have, going to school, making friends, having a parent that looks after them, that buys them toys, clothes, that makes them food...

>>73057635
>You said I was anti science a few minutes ago, and now you throw that one, lmao. 
Not an argument. I told you why evolution is bullshit. I bet you don't even understand the argument itself. I'll dumb it down. 
Mutations = natural selection = evolution.
Adaptation =\= evolution. Adaptation fixates genes already present in the genome. 
Evolution needs to create said genes and genomes with mutations. 
The argument is with enough retard mutations, you'll get lucky and get a good one and natural selection will fixate for it. Many issues arise from this. 1. mutations arising are random. It's luck if you even get any. 2. Repair enzymes fix them. So you have to hope you get a good mutation and the hope the repair enzymes don't fix it. Super retarded. 3. On top of this, you need it to have a function for natural selection to even take place, but the issue here is irreducible complexity. For instance a screw in an engine has 0 function. You need a minimum number of parts for an engine to be considered an engine. In nature, it's the same shit. You need a function or natural selection won't take place and so that in itself already acts as a dead end for any type of engineering concept within the body since they require a vast number of components to even have a function in the first place. 
So all this to say the "mechanism" evolutionists cane up with doesn't work.

That and genetic entropy is the final nail in the coffin. DNA has been degrading over time. Not the other way around. 
>just because you don't understand a topic, you're ready to dismiss it as being untrue?

--- 73057913
I am going to explain right here how mutations work because you retards didn't study it in HS, you should thank me for doing what the school system failed you.

A mutation is an event that affects a localized spot on a DNA strand, as we all know in this thread you need the DNA strand to have the right sequence of nucleotides, because the sequence will then be converted into an mRNA and then converted into a protein by rybosomes, if there is a mutation, the sequence is altered, and AT BEST the protein will be able to function normally, while at worst it won't function at all, which is why mutations are really fucking dangerous, that has literally nothing to do with being trans.

We know that being trans has to do with a combination of genes and hormone washes received inside the uterus.
--- 73057915
>>73057717
>. mutations arising are random. It's luck if you even get any
It's not like it took billions of years for that process to take place, right? Your lack of sense of time scales puts your whole argumentation in trouble. 
All you're saying is how unlikely it is for life to emerge from chaos, but that didn't happen overnight.

--- 73057937
>>73057913
one flaw in all of this
mutations lead to macrobiology over time, and saying at best it's normal and at worst the dna won't function at all really says nothing, that's like saying you had a 0.00001% chance to become a retard, and that is why mutations are dangerous always
--- 73057946

You're stupid as fuck. Most of what you said was correct, but the main issue with mutations is it makes it so whatever gets mutated doesn't work the way it was initially programmed to work. 
Now I will say it's not 100% known exactly to the t how someone becomes trans, but it's safe to say it had to be a result of someone's programming getting altered.

enough of the fucking strawman arguments. I said the current ideology of mutations+natural selection=evolution doesn't have actual logic to it
--- 73058014
>>73057937
You actually lack reading comprehension, i didn't say at bestit's normal, i said at best the protein will function normally, because it's possible the sequence affected on the DNA strand determined a change into the aminoacid inserted that overall doesn't impact the structure of the protein to the point where it folds in a way that makes it entirely or partially non functional, not only that but you have no idea what you're talking about, you need MANY MANY mutations to alter the macrobiology of an individual, not just a single mutation, a single mutation just determines one incorrectly translated protein, it's why multiple combinations of genes are correlated with homosexuality, and a gene isn't a single sequence of DNA, a gene is an entire fucking portion of a DNA.

"The typical confirmed human gene has 12 exons of an average length of 236 base pairs each, separated by introns of an average length of 5,478 base pairs" 

Do you have any idea how many proteins you can get out of that? And the genes are all perfectly functional, it's just a combination of them that leads to this result, and you don't get to say that nature didn't intend for this either, because like it has already been stated this is the literal intended process involved in determining which genes a child will inherit, it's intended for it to potentially result in homosexuality.
--- 73058016

So...I can't believe it, we are back in HS, a protein is made up of several tridimensional structures, we have the primary structure that is simply the sequence of aminoacids, we have the secondary structure, which is determined bu how the aminoacids bond between one another, and then we have the tertiary structure, which is how the protein will fold accordingly to the acqueous environment found within the cytoplasm, because some aminoacids are polar and some aren't, so they want to distribute accordingly, from time to time we also have a quaternary structure, when several tertiary structures associate in order to form a complex, one such example is homoglobin...So now that we have established this, if we change one polar aminoacid, such as lysine, with another polar aminoacid, such as serine, the protein MAY assemble itself nonetheless in the proper primary, secondary, and tertiary structure, this is what it's called a silent mutation, and it doesn't affect the organism, because the protein is still able to function the way it was intended to.

You literally cannot win with me on this front, i study pharmacy in uni.

You parroted concepts you do not even understand and the only substantial thing you said is "evolution is unlikely" completely ignoring the time frame in which evolution takes place (not million, but billions of years). 
You say DNA is degrading but you cannot even explain what it's degrading into, and what has it been degraded from. 
You just chose an author which reinforce your religious point of view and you shielding your ignorance behind it.

You spoke like someone who completely deciphered 100% of the brain's mysteries, and how single genes affect the mind as a whole. 
From a gene to a functional protein? Yeah we got that covered. 
From a protein to how neurons grow, interconnect and shape the human mind? No we are still very far from uncovering that mystery 
You simply do not know what causes trannies to exist. No one does.

Mutations are neither good nor bad. They drive change in the cell and that change can be beneficial, neutral or deleterious.

Of course it does. Your whole point is how unlikely it is for a mutation to go all the way from occuring to surviving the self repairing mechanisms of the cell, and then cause an actual beneficial change in the organism. 
It is unlikely. That's why evolution took billions of years to go from single cell organisms to you. 
Your ignorance on the topic doesn't make the answers any less true. This is the opposite of religion: you don't have to believe it for it to be true.
--- 73058140
>>73058107
I do want to add that mutations can only ever be beneficial when taken out of the context of the body of the creature taken into consideration, a mutation can only ever be damaging or silent at best, however when you take a mutation and you apply it to the environment suddenly there is the potential for it to be beneficial, and that has to do with evolution.

>mutations+natural selection=evolution doesn't have actual logic to it
Of course it has. You're just too stupid to see it. 
Mutations promote changes in the organisms and throughout time, natural selection will favour the organisms with advantageous changes, while cutting off the organisms with deleterious ones. 
In long time scales, advantages are accumulated and speciation happens when organisms are so different from each other they can no longer breed. 
You can observe this happening in real time in a petri dish. You can use this in your favor to breed completely novel subspecies of animals. We literally did that to dogs.

>Why are you trans
Ask god, I was born this way. For as long as I can remember, I always felt like a little girl. I gravitated towards every single girl thing in our world, while rejecting everything male oriented. I can remember being 4/5 yo and sneaking out of my parents view to wear mommy's clothes and put on make up. 
Of course my family tried their best to fight it my entire life. Beatings, grounded, privileges taken away, going to sleep without supper, sent to church counselors, church groups, church therapist, they spent my entire life trying to change me and lock me in the male box. 
So fast forward to me at 16, presenting myself as a cisgendered straight person to society, severely depressed, suicidal, cutting myself, thinking about running away, ending my life, or just cutting my balls with scissors and burning the house down. 
Luckily I found a support network of queer friends who saved my life in everyway a person can be saved, and slowly I learned to affirm my presence at home and fight for my right to be who I was in my family's house. 
They kicked me out when I was 18, but I got a job and was able to afford transition. I've been on hormones for a few years now and I've never been happier. I never lost contact with my siblings, they helped me through it all, and I recently got in touch with my father again after years not spoking, he wants to see me again this year so I guess things are slowly getting better

I remember my therapist used to ask me that all the time, it just hurt so much being in this body, being forced to see it change in horrible ways against my will, I realized when I was 16 and I started to grow body and facial hair, it disgusted me so much and ruined how I looked, I was so ashamed of it even if it was normal for boys, I was also working out a lot to try getting a more feminine body, but I realized it didn't work at all, it didn't matter how many squats I did, my butt word never look round and full like a woman's, because fat simply didn't go there, I was just so disgusted with my body, when I realized working out wouldn't save me, that my bone structure was changing to make my face look sharper and I could do nothing about it, I got really depressed and tried to ignore these feelings, I have been depressed since I was 18 and it lasted 4 years, it progressively hot worse, I stopped going to college because my class was filled with women and it would give me intense jealousy, I lost all my friends because I didn't have the energy to reply back and meet with them, I stopped going outside because I was ashamed, I stopped working out because it was pointless, at times I didn't even have the strength to eat, I would just spend all day crying in bed and staring at the ceiling, I realized that if I kept ignoring who I was I was going to die by suicide because life was so painful, I started taking the meds 2 months ago and I am so happy now, does that explain why I couldn't just be a gay man?

Again with the hair splitting. Again, I'll dumb it down. Mutations are DETRIMENTAL. We had a near perfect coding that has only gotten fucked over the years by mutations. Mutations lead to disorder, not the other way around. If you want to say that's "natural". Fuck it. Go ahead. I don't care anymore. Fact of the matter is it is DETRIMENTAL to organisms despite the retarded propaganda that is shoved to people saying mutations "can be good if you're lucky enough!".

Of course it is. Why can't you address it properly?
The unlikeliness of life emerging out of chaos pales in comparison to the time frame it took to do so. 
A tornado can't create a factory, but your analogy oversimplify reality and make room for misconceptions to arise. 
A tornado can't build a house, but if you boil a molecular soup for millions of years, you will get self replicating chemical reactions. Give it billions of years, and you get a single celled organism. Give it a few more billions of years and you get multicellular organisms. 
You simply cannot argue against this time frame. What do you say about the fossil records? 
We have fossils of stromatolites that lived 3 billion years ago.

Tornadoes won't build cities, but swarm of chemical reactions will produce, given enough time, self replicating patterns. That's what you are.
Just because you cannot comprehend the huge time scale at play, and the enormous amount of time it took for each single mutation to add constructively into the building blocks of life, it doesn't make it any less true.

--- 73058782
>>73058712
>Again, there is no proof that suggests being trans is a mutation
No, but with deductive reasoning you could see it's probably what it is since normal coding makes you straight. Common sense would dictate something went array with a trans coding. We are in fact programmed to be straight. That is our prime coding. The only way to deviate from that is from mutations. It's like say excel. You highlight a column you want to let's say add, it will do that. If let's say the coding pertaining to that feature got fucked by whatever may have caused it, it will no longer do what was originally programmed and probably come up with an error. No proof this is the case with trans since little is known, but it would make perfect sense to assume that's what happened.

Think about it. Can I become gay? Maybe a few brainwashed into thinking sexuality is fluid, but logically no. I can't just become attracted to men. Why? I'm not programmed to do that. Simple as that. My coding says "women are hot".

I already addressed all the issues above. Namely how we have many engineering aspects within our body that can't have been a result off of one mutation, but the issue is that even if you get a mutation thay could be useful in the future, it's mot relevant. It would have to be relevant day one to be fixated. For instance, again, an engine. Engines have screws, rotor, valves, etc. Is any of that useful by itself? No. Engines have a minimum number of parts needed to be functional. Evolution doesn't have foresight. If it can't make use of something day 1, it won't get fixated by natural selection. Simple as that.

Yes, you cannot become gay, but it's known that being gay is a consequence of several combinations of genes and their interaction with the environment, perfectly healthy and working genes capable of producing perfectly healthy proteins, there is no "negative" or "error" involved, just because most people are straight it doesn't mean a deviation from it is inherently unhealthy, and even if it was, what about it?

No mutations are nearly always harmful or neutral. By mere chance they MIGHT have a benefit, but usually with a down side attached to it so not even a 100% net gain. Even the neutral ones are bad in the sense that they contribute to making the DNA coding more eroded with time.

False. For instance if you had 1 chance to get a lotto ticket that has a 1 in a billion chance of winning, are you guaranteed to win? No. You'd have 1 in a billion chance. Again, just because you CAN win doesn't mean you will. It's not complicated, midwit

>>73058816
It's possible it's not heritable and it's just straight up random. There really isn't enough info online on this shit because even scientists don't get it yet, but in the same time there is a reason most people are straight. Look at this pic. Some people here are going to say "well society got more progressive so that's why there's more lgbtq. Because people feel safer coming out of the closet". That's true, but also bullshit to say that's ALL that happened. 
Are you really going to sit there and tell me 20% of boomers were lgbtq, but 18% were too scared to admit it? You really think THAT many boomers were in the closet? You really think the REAL amount in America was ALWAYS 20% like it is with gen z, when times are hyper progressive? I don't buy that. 
I see it as a combination of feeling safer, propaganda (not the same as feeling safer. Just straight up brainwashed), but also genetic entropy (which is a fact btw. Genetic entropy shows mutations are cumulative per generation. Don't believe me? Go watch some Dr. Sanford on youtube). 
So again, scientists don't have a solid answer due to how complex these bodies are so they are still trying to figure it out, but I think it's highly reasonable to associate coding errors with sexual orientation going against the norm. 

EVEN from an evolutionary perspective, it would make ZERO sense to want anything other than straight people because the whole point to life is to REPRODUCE. Trans and gays are not wired to reproduce which goes against the "survival" purpose given to organisms. Even evolutionists say evolution gravitates towards SURVIVAL (natural selection being the "great filter to get the essential parts in there"). 
How would it make sense for trans and gays to contribute to that purpose? It doesn't.

Until they aren't. 
Advantageous mutations are selected and preserved, making multiple generations of an organism basically accumulate advantages, becoming more adapted to its environment. 
If you can make your cell better at breaking down sugar by changing one aminoacid in the kinase enzyme, You've got a tiny little molecular advantage compared to other cells. 
Give enough time, and this process can make cells arrive anywhere: from developing internal organelles with specific celular function, to developing celular structures designed for locomotion. All it takes is changing one aminoacid in one protein.

For instance, we have molecular machines in our cells. If I gave you one part out of say 100, that won't do shit. Say a machine needs 30 of the right parts in the right order to minimally function, what the FUCK is it going tk do from steps 1-29 without a function?

Sometimes you forget what the true meaning of mutation is: one different aminoacid
By having one single different aminoacid, a protein will be a tiny bit different, and if it is a tiny bit more efficient at its job with this mutation, than that gets passed on. 
The new generation has that new protein plus that 1 different aminoacid. Now if another mutation happens, and changes yet another aminoacid, the protein changes a little bit more. The shape is changed, its properties are changed. If that turns out to be advantageous, the organism is selected for and that new gene is passed along. 
One aminoacid at a time, these tiny changes in the proteins accumulated. One aminoacid at a time, proteins were improved and perfected by sheer chance.

Trans women, depending on when they started hrt, should be allowed to compete against female athletes, because it is extremely well understood that a kid who was on puberty blockers and then immediately went on hrt at 18 had a very similar development when it comes to bone and muscular structure to women, obviously you cannot have a trans woman in her 40s that just started taking hrt a year ago compete with women, but you don't really see that happen, do you?

Cells don't contain either, but they do contain molecular machinery that can change through time, one aminoacid at a time.
Each new advantageous mutation will be statically more likely to be passed on, and that's how evolution happens.

--- 73059653
>>73059535
It doesn't work in the same way at all, a molecular engine has the ability to change, either through mutations that make it more beneficial to the environment the creature finds itself if, or through negative mutations, in which case the animal dies off and the negative mutation isn't passed on, an engine doesn't have the ability to improve itself, it will remain static throughout its life span.

>An engine in our cells works in similar ways as engines you see in real life.
Except for it's nanoscale and it's propensity to be highly affected by small environmental changes, like having one aminoacid misplaced during synthesis. 
It's through errors like that that evolution happens. 
One mutation at a time, with accumulated effects, over millions of years, and you can build an enzyme for basically every cell function

If you change only one aminoacid (1 mutation) that causes a small change in the protein that turns out to be advantageous, that's a day 1 advantage that you're talking about. I don't know why you are ignoring this possibility when it's pretty much a reality. 
You only need to change one aminoacid to improve the protein. One at a time and you can go far.

Go back to bible reading if you can't handle a bit of science. 
A molecular rotor didn't arise from nothing. It evolved from simpler molecules that slowly changed throughout time. 
Each new change that brought an advantage to the overall chemical function of the rotor was preserved. 
As millions of years passed, the motor took its current shape, optimized by the combined power of mutations plus selection.
From simpler to more complex. If only you could do something similar with your intellect
--- 73059869
>>73059727
You talk about genetic entropy when in fact it's the thriving force of evolution. 
As mutations happen and accumulate, selection will see that organisms with advantageous mutations will be more likely to pass on their genes, accumulating that advantage in the pool. 
You only remember entropy when you talk about degrading the code, but you forget that the same thriving force can be used to improve it thanks to selection pressures of the environment.

>The rotor itself is useless
No it isn't. It's an enzyme. It catalyzes a chemical reaction. In its more primitive stages, it was probably much less efficient. 
See atp synthase, that protein that your mitochondria uses to produce energy. 
With only its primary back bone, the molecule is already functional and it can spin, but at a lower velocity and decreased efficiency. 
With each passing mutation, each one bringing another aminoacid to the game, it's shape was gradually improved and perfected. It's efficiency increased. It evolved into the full molecular motor we get now.
And this was the second greatest evolutionary milestone in the life of our planet, losing only to photosynthesis. Atp synthase was a game changer, and it spread throughout the globe. But it didn't start in this magnificent shape. It started as something smaller, weaker and much less efficient 
Go back to biology classes. You didn't learn it well
--- 73060036
>>73059931
>a rotor won't do shit by itself thus no natural selection this no fixation
The "rotor" you speak of is an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction, do you even know what that means? It means it makes the reaction happens faster, easier with less input energy. 
Before taking it's final stage as a motor protein, it had some previous more primitive shapes that got the chemical job done, albeit less efficient. 
Through mutations, it's efficiency was increased one aminoacid at a time, until it was perfected by millions of years of mutations And selection. 
We have extensive evidence of this by analyzing co evolution of genes in different species. 
But you only see what you want to see, and you don't want to see science and answers. You want to see god and the bible.

I think you are conflating things here... The rotor is not a part of a molecular machinery, it is the very molecular machinery. 
Before being a fully functional rotor, it assumed a more primitive simpler shape that still had the active sites to interact with substrates, making it a viable enzyme for a chemical reaction, but it was less efficient. 
With newer mutations, its efficiency was slowly improved. The molecular machinery at play was improved by cumulative changes in its structure that was selected for and passed along the gene pool
What part of that you don't understand? 
A not so efficient molecular machinery suffered mutations and the advantageous mutations were positively selected for and accumulated throughout time.

It wasn't always a rotor. It started of as an enzyme with a simpler shape. The growth of its tridimensional shape into a rotor is part of the evolutionary process of that singular protein, which might have taken millions of years, and it may have started with a single peptide of 10 aminoacids or so

Here. Why the HELL would it slowly evolve into a rotor in the first place? Answer that. Why the hell would it sacrifice it's previous tole to then somehow know to create a rotor that would perfectly fit into the molecular machine as we know it today? There's 0 logic for a transition like that

This is a very dumb take. 
It didn't start as a rotor, it started as a spinning molecule, that's all. It provided torque in exchange for chemical energy from atp. It didn't need a rotatory shape or a rich ensemble of molecular gears, but it also had reduced effectiveness. 
Both the rotor protein and its anchoring structural proteins coevolved together until they reached a shape and configuration that completely maximized their energy input, and so they were improved by evolution. 
One aminoacid at a time.

Again you basically said "started as enzyme that helped with 'reactions' and then slowly for some weird ass reason shaped itself into a rotor and then for some other weird ass reason other things such as the stator and and hook (who also were doing their own thing before) magically were like 'hey! Let's team up! You rotor! I'm the stator. Go inside of me!" etc.
Absolutely retarded. It's not just retarded for the rotor to come from random enzymes that were doing their own thing, but then the other components would have had to have done their own thing, become their own specific part of the end goal (the engine) and then magically come about together and magically connect and magically have the perfect shape to fit with one another too.

A good theory regarding mitochondria is that they originally used to be separate organisms that then were absorbed by cells, and just evolved alongside the cells throughout history, perfectly complementing each other, there is good evidence for it too, I don't see why it would be that unthinkable for two proteins that used to serve separate goals to unite in a quaternary structure in order to complement each other.

No, faggot. The constants themselves do not prove the identity of a specific creator. It hints at ingenuity from a creator because you're only other option is "we got lucky with just one chance". More chances increases probability of something happening. One chance = you're fucked. Here are your options basically
1. You believe the constants were engineered by a creator
2. You believe we got lucky as fuck
3. You believe the universal constants would be the same no matter what (which is bull since the mass of the big bang itself most likely influenced them so you'd have to assume the big bang only had one way to develop meaning we just got lucky there too from sheer coincidence) 
4. You believe in infinite universes and we were just one where the big bang/universal constants were perfectly situated for life (infinite universes is scifi btw).

Public school employees are so utterly replacable that millions of parents do their job on their spare time via homeschooling. The main advantage of school is the socialization with other children, not the teachers themselves.

Priests generally make almost no money from their job [their daily wage is below minimum wage] and usually only survive because of another profession or specialization. They also provide a moral fabric to society that a morbidly obese, childless, alphabet-identifying mid twenties woman could never bring to the world in her lifetime.

How so? Do improbable events occur or not? Are you saying no one has ever won the lottery? Why is us getting lucky once harder to swallow that all-powerful intelligent alien that dosen't obey the laws of casualty?

You can tell intelligent design is utterly bankrupt because it dosen't actually explain anything. If I look at a species, say those begbugs who gay rape each other with barbed penises, evolution gives us an actual reason we can understand. We you say "God did it," it's on you to explain how and why God did it. Just giving credit to shit for God is useless unless you know enough about God to explain the universe around me, and literally no creationist has ever given me a good reason for God to specifically create gay rape bed bugs, or anything else for that matter. As soon as you start to ask any question deeper than "Did God do this?" the whole thing falls apart because theists aren't interested in actually explaining the world, the way science does, it just exists to get you to shut up and conform or else. I'll give creationism some credit if it can come up with (1) testable hypothesis that would be true in a created world and false in a lucky one.

If the world is intelligently designed by an all-knowing creator, He must have known and intended for there to be gay rape bed bugs. Given that gay rape goes against what's in the Bible, we can conclude that the Bible is not an accurate description of the creator of bed bugs, and once beg bugs are uncreated then you can apply the same logic to literally everything in the universe.

Are you really telling me that the universe with gay rape bedbugs and incurable birth defects is the Mona Lisa? Our universe is more like one of those modern are canvases splattered all over it. I COULD be an intelligent design, but it mostly looks random. Want to prove me wrong? Providing a good reason for the gay rape bedbugs would be a good start.
>>73065002
>How the fuck should I know, lol? There is weird horrid shit all over the planet such as animals eating kids, torture shit, etc. That existing as a concept neither probes nor disproves anything.
The whole premise of Intelligent Design is that the design of the universe is intelligent. If there are stupid, horrible, and pointless parts of the universe, that's not a reason to shrug and give up, it's a reason to discard the intelligent design hypothesis altogether. If the universe was designed for an intelligent purpose, then intelligent beings (created in the image of god) should see that intelligence and purpose reflected in everything. But the very same people who insist everything happened "for a reason" can't explain the reason for God to create even a single solitary thing. If you feel up to the challenge, start with the gay rape bedbugs for me. You wouldn't want to imply some things in God's design are just random or unimportant, would you? Intelligent perfect beings don't make mistakes and they wouldn't waste resources. The natural world is literally defined by all the mistakes and wasted resources.

You think "rape bugs are weird therefore it was all random". 
It makes more sense to see this universe as designed because there are too many things that would require retarded amounts of luck to simply ignore. It's like seeing a nuclear submarine and saying "nature did it" instead of a team of engineers and blue collar workers

I'm pointing out that the world we live in is not the Mona Lisa, fuckwit, it's full of mistakes and imperfections and shit that makes no sense. The Mona Lisa may be overrated, but you can point to any part of it and explain what that part does, and why ol' Leonardo painted it that way. You can't point to even one part of your "Mona Lisa" and explain what function it serves to its creator.
>You think "rape bugs are weird therefore it was all random".
If it's not all random why are there gay rape bed bugs? You're claiming the universe is intelligently designed, and I'm asking what's so intelligent about part of it. God is the most amazing craftsman possible so you should be able to explain every part of his creation, just like you can do with the Mona Lise.
>It makes more sense to see this universe as designed because there are too many things that would require retarded amounts of luck to simply ignore. 
But "retarded amounts of luck" can and does happen every day. Intelligent beings who live outside of time have never once been spotted
>It's like seeing a nuclear submarine and saying "nature did it" instead of a team of engineers and blue collar workers
You can explain every single part of a nuclear submarine, and even somehow who had no idea what was could in theory infer it's purpose. You should be able to do the same thing with gay rape bedbugs, if the world is really like nuclear submarine.
>Just because there is weird shit on this planet, it doesn't magically act as proof for or against a creator
In order to have a "creator" you have to have a purpose for creating. Every single created thing in the universe has a purpose to its creator, even sick amusement, and yet the universe has no purpose to your God. If there's no way to tell the difference between a created and non-created universe, they why take the extra step of adding a creator you don't need to explain anything?

A Person if you have a fucking brain, dipshit.
Now looking at nature, a cell for instance is not some random shit that nature gravitates towards. That is also an example of "the mona lisa". So are the constants. That's what you don't get. You cherry pick

What kind of cell, exactly, did God design? Was it animal cells? Fungal cells? Bacterial cells? All of them are radically different and only one of them can be perfect. If you want to say they serve different functions, you have to have at least some guess as to what those functions are.
>I already dumbed it down for you, dipshit. Something being odd doesn't prove nor disprove anything. Low IQ cunt. How many times must I repeat that? This is known as a false equivocation.
You think gay rape with barbed penises is just "odd?" Okay, what about birth defects that result in the baby dying in agony through no fault of its own? What's the divine purpose in that? You can't just dismiss it as "odd" because it literally involves babies dying in pain.
>Again, retard, CAN nature create a nuclear submarine from scratch? Yes. Yes it can. Again, dumbass. Just because it CAN doesn't mean that's what happened.
So then what did happen? You keep insisting we didn't get lucky but you was no explanation. If the universe were created us, you have to explain who did and WHY.

You still haven't even given me a single reason for what you think is true, other than "seems pretty weird, eh?" What is your actual theory on how this happened, or are you insisting on a God you don't understand at all?

You STUPI FUCK. I already addressed this shit like 5 fucking times. Just because you think something is cruel or weird as shit doesn't prove nor disprove anything
>You keep insisting we didn't get lucky but you was no explanation. 
I did. I gave 4 potential possibilities, but given the engineering and given how nature has never demonstrated actual engineering feats from scratch (i.e. molecular machines from scratch, cell from scratch, etc.) there is no reason to gravitate towards that just as you wouldn't gravitate to saying a submarine was created by luck. You'd say a "coordinated process" created a submarine. Not luck. 
If the universe were created us, you have to explain who did and WHY.
No I don't, fool. I don't have powers to magically just "know" why this creator chose to do this. For instance idk why the fuck the guy who painted the Mona Lisa did it other than because he "wanted to". I don't have to know that to be able to attribute that work to a person rather than to nature. 
>You still haven't even given me a single reason for what you think is true, other than "seems pretty weird, eh?" 
I did. Read above. Engineering doesn't just happen through sheer luck. It CAN just as how you can get a nuclear submarine from nature alone, but logically with a brain you'd assume a team of engineers and blue collar workers did it. Not nature. Just because something CAN be created from nature alone*stupid amounts of luck doesn't mean that's what happened

No, I'm asking YOU to PROVE these things are INTELLIGENT. Can you do that or not?

Dude we've seen nature creature molecular machines and cells in pitri dishes with nothing more than dirty seawater and electricity. Also, once again the submarine has a PURPOSE. What is the PURPOSE of a cell? Intelligent designers don't do thing without a PURPOSE. Are you fucking deaf?
> No I don't, fool. I don't have powers to magically just "know" why this creator chose to do this.
If you don't know even the most basic things about your creator, maybe keep your theories to yourself until you manage to figure it out.
>I did. Read above. Engineering doesn't just happen through sheer luck. It CAN just as how you can get a nuclear submarine from nature alone, but logically with a brain you'd assume a team of engineers and blue collar workers did it. Not nature.
Engineers engineer things for a reason. If you don't know the reason God did something, you can't possibly know if it's engineered or not. Saying the universe was engineered is meaningless unless that lets you actually explain why the universe is the way it is.
>Just because something CAN be created from nature alone*stupid amounts of luck doesn't mean that's what happened
But you can't rule it out, can you? Whereas I can easily rule out intelligent design until you show me some actual intelligent purpose to the universe.

People itt are dogmatically preaching what they learnt from ((pop science)) and highschool, neither of which promote independent thought. The theory of evolution was originally created to account for the variations between different species caused by environmental/geographic factors i.e. darwin's finches. It's ludicrous to take that theory and use it to account for the existence of life itself. Darwin didn't even know of the organelles within cells when he created that theory. There are so many holes within evolution it's ridiculous.

For starters, if evolution is a gradual development in the survival and reproductive capabilities of a species, then why is there such a huge gap between homosapiens and our ape cousins in intelligence, language, culture, etc? Why are human beings the apex predator by a thousand miles, whereby we are untouchable? Where is the intermediate species which we evolved from?

What's more, it is impossible for a cell to gradually evolve from molecules under natural selection. A cell is made up of constituent parts, all of which are essential to the survival of it. If even one of these constituent parts are missing, the cell dies, and fails to confer a survival advantage. In this scenario, how can one gradually evolve to this complete state? A cell cannot gradually evolve one organelle at a time, as each organelle serves a unique and specific purpose without which the rest of the cell dies. Even DNA cannot exist purely on its own. All of these parts have to be present at the same time, and the fact that they all play a specific role with a larger purpose in mind indicates an intelligent creator who knew the role and function of these parts. It would be like trying to create a mouse trap gradually through evolution, except without a spring the mouse trap is useless, without bait it is useless, without a clasp to snare the animal it is useless. The complexity of life indicates an intelligent creator, not randomness or trial and error.

Bullshit. This is like saying if you don't know why a novel was written, the novel can't have been created by an intelligent author. It may as well just be a bunch of random keystrokes. Why does everything have to have a purpose? Why does everything have to be about efficiency?

>Bullshit. This is like saying if you don't know why a novel was written, the novel can't have been created by an intelligent author. It may as well just be a bunch of random keystrokes.
A novel has an well-understood purpose - to be read and to convey information.
>Why does everything have to have a purpose? 
Because a purpose is what separates intelligence from randomness. If you don't have a purpose, you left with the idea that God created by accident, and that's not intelligent design at all, that's unintelligent design.
>Why does everything have to be about efficiency?
You're claiming that the world is "engineered" by an "engineer." If you knew any actual engineers you'd know getting things to be efficient enough is most of their fucking jobs. Engineering things are almost always more efficient than things designed by random chance. Since nothing in nature is efficient, there's no reason to assume anyone is "engineering" it.

But we know the sub was engineered because we have records of it being designed and built. We have no record of the universe being designed and built. The universe is not a nuclear submarine, it's morel like rock shaped like a face. Could have been carved by intelligence, might not have been.

But you've yet to provide any reason to think the universe is designed at all. All you can do is find weak excuses not to accept my conclusion instead of actually debating me, because creationism dosen't actually say anything useful about the universe. Unless the existence of creator has some kind of consequence for us here and now, there's not reason to even really think about it.

No, stupid. If ai showed you a picture of a submarine with 0 context, you wouldn't have access to any other information. With common fucking sense you'd say it was engineered because nature doesn't do that shit just because "it can".
>The universe is not a nuclear submarine, it's morel like rock shaped like a face.
Disingenuous. If any of the constants were off, you wouldn't have life. That in itself implies engineering. So do all the components within a cell. You're coping at this point. 
>But you've yet to provide any reason to think the universe is designed at all. 
False. Literally every post I made towards you plus others above were me explaining how nature doesn't just make cells/machines from scratch "just because it is in the realm of possibility".
Nature has never demonstrated engineering capabilities. It doesn't gravitate to creating abstract engineering concepts.

I'm pretty sure if you told a group of people who had never seen a submarine before that it was some kind of fish, they might believe you. The problem is that you can't look at a submarine the way someone with 0 context would, so perhaps the nuclear submarine is a bad example?
 >Disingenuous. If any of the constants were off, you wouldn't have life.
Why does God want life? You never established what the purpose of fine-tuning the constants is. If the purpose was life, then I hate to say it but this universe is almost totally empty. I'm sure there were other values that would have produced more life.
That in itself implies engineering.
Engineering for what? Engineering has a purpose.
>So do all the components within a cell. You're coping at this point.
You don't even know the first fucking thing about cells, as demonstrated earlier when you didn't know the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Just because you don't understand cells doesn't mean that they're magical and ineffable and impossible for nature to produce.
>False. Literally every post I made towards you plus others above were me explaining how nature doesn't just make cells/machines from scratch "just because it is in the realm of possibility".
So then what is your bar for determining what nature can "produce from scratch" and what has to be "engineered?" There all kinds of nonliving chemical reactions just as complex as cells, you just don't know about them.
>Nature has never demonstrated engineering capabilities.
For this to matter you have to prove that cells were engineered. They're extremely fragile and inefficient compared to human technology, so your God was a terrible engineer in that case.

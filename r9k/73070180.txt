definitely learn how to draw.

i have so many ideas in my head that i would like to draw but i can't because i don't know how.

I see it as better than even having good writing skills because some things can't be expressed in words.

If I could learn a second skill would also be a way to get financial freedom

I could ask her but it was a long time ago and idk if she still has it. I will search for it in google if I can find it
--- 73071956
As in instantly download the knowledge into my brain like The Matrix? 100% it would be art, I would make myself Da Vinci level at sketching, painting, and sculpting just for fun. I really like writing and good art goes a long way in that medium. Imagine how far your career would go being able to draw Miura level manga panels from day 1

Drawing is a beatiful skill and hard to master. I encourage you to practice it but if not I also understand that is a long way.

>>73072136
Social skills normally get underrated. I know how to program, I could teach or give you some resources to strart learning or where to get a mentor :]

It sounds childish, but I look up to people who make games since they gave me a lot of fun times when I was a kid so I'd like that.
Something even smaller would be learning how to learn, how to absorb information and utilize it. If my head didn't make so many careless errors than I'd be somewhere very different
--- 73073056
>>73072927
I'm sorry you had a dificult childhood. I think you are very strong for having to carry that weight for all this time. I belive you can find the motivation to start writing again don't lose hope.

Just back up your lies with some truth.

Say you are experienced in XYZ. learn some XYZ
Say you worked in ABC, go and volunteer in ABC and read about ABC
Say you are 6 foot 4. wear high heels
Say you like 123, spend the day reviewing 123

>I just made all this nonsense up

Say you've worked at Twitter before The Firing, their HR is nonfunctional so the company will have to trust you on this one

there are 3 main methods:

dress-up lies:
>took 2 french classes, congrats youre fluent in french
>know the basics of python, congrats youre adept at python
i like to do this specifically with skills that the job im applying for doesnt need so i dont get called out on it

refute this cucko:
>i worked at toys-r-us
>i worked at sears
>i worked at blockbuster
>i worked at twitter
>i worked at radioshack
etc. the idea here is that since these companies are almost defunct theres no way to prove you didnt work there

just fucking lie:
>do it
>say you worked for google, give them your friends number if they ask for a reference
>9 times out of 10 they dont even check
>do it pussy

I said on my resume that I had years of experience as an office admin at my grandmas company. When they ask about it I just say the company doesn't exist anymore. Pretty easy to lie desu.

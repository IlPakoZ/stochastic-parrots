Dear Meaghan, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, girl? How's your new man?
My new girl's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Meaghan
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, girl
Anyways, I hope you get this, girl, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is John

Dear Meaghan, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your house, you didn't have to
I waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, girl, you're like my fuckin' idol
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met on Discord? 
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father either
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your texts
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and read 'em again
'Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Meaghan, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, girl, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, John - PS We should be together too

i can nofap, get really intense emotions and attachment and energy towards women. but after i finally hit that nut button, it's all gone. 

i immediately feel like "i dont care about this person" whoever im fapping to. I assume it'd be the same if i was literally having sex, which is extremely unsettling. 

im not sure if i felt this way before, or if it's a new thing. i dont even watch porn anymore. so... am i fucked? you guys feel the same? is this male biology?

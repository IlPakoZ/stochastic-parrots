Consume products then work to pay for consuming more products. You will be happy when women find out you exist in your mid to late 30s.

Go groom kids into your mental illness or spam us with BBC shit for the sake of a false power fantasy to cope or kill yourself.
Those seem to be the main things you freaks do once reality kicks back in.

I can't find much. I don't know who I am. I sit in front of a computer every day. 
I have a Physics final in 30 minutes. I don't care about it but my parents push education on me. It hasn't gotten me anywhere. 
I mean, I'm always pleasant to others. I smile and crack jokes but I suck at talking and anxiety keeps me inside. That's about it. 
I'll check back in like 2 hours once im don't with this shit.

Just pursuit your own happiness, preferably not at the cost of others'. Avoid materialism and seek honesty with yourself. Don't care too much about what others will think about you but always take any chance to improve for your own good. There's really not much else to life.

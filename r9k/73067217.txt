culture war bs. i still don't know why he chose to pander to conservatives since the ev market was (and still is) overwhelmingly liberal. plus he had already won the favor of the mainly-liberal entertainment industry (snl, simpsons, south park, and rick and morty all featured him as a guest star, infact r&amp;m featured him AFTER he called someone a pedo in an argument).

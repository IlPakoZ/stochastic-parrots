Just make a joke that breaks global rule 1 and you'll get a permanent ban on every board with like 3-5 appeals that get auto-rejected. Not that I'd know anything about that.

What was so bad about it this week particularly?

r9k can be such a mixed bag
sometimes it's filled with porn, trannies, discord, racebait threads and then on some other time I find thread after thread of interesting stuff
I read an interesting idea here once that one in a hundred threads will actually be funny or interesting and the rest is brainrot garbage but you just keep looking for that rare thread
I find r9k particularly active with good threads before and on the weekends but that isn't always the case
I suggest lurking on other imageboards

the good thread is the fruition of the brainrot threads. you need to consoom both to appreciate the former.

I think I'm a broken person and need medication. The things that make normal people happy do nothing for me, and I can't feel emotions as intensely as I used to.

I was in your position in the past. The meds only made my life more dull and subdued, the emotions never came back. I was on meds on and off for years, and I still feel emotionally stunted. I've learned to cope with my limited capacity, and I urge you to do the same without the weight of medication dragging you down. Learning to live with your unfortunate circumstances is better than shoving chemicals down your throat.

I don't think I can. I've been fighting a losing battle against depression for almost 20 years now. I don't like not to being able to feel emotions.

No real luck with anything so i have just accepted this is normal and i do alot of steroids.
>inb4 ur dur roid monkey cope cope cope
yes, i just accepted this is how life is for someone like me after 10 years of trying to get fixed and being normal i have been filtered.

I will still probably have children because the roids make my personality bad but in a way women enjoy for some reason i dont understand (only very specific broken ones though vs the previous none)

But just do whatever works man, life is far to miserable and long as fuck to do what other people say is the right thing. If drinking alcohol until you die an obese tard is what works then thats the best you can do.

A real common thing i see on /r9k/ after adding people is this though which is amusing
>anon goes to therapist
>anon lies to therapist alot
>no progress
>anon thinks the therapist is like in hollywood movie
>the therapist is supposed to solve anon like a puzzle
>anon goes to new therapist
>repeat
make yourself hurt on purpose, see how that works for you. Thats what i did and i found something that makes me functional just by asking
>how can i make the depression even bigger

I am currently writing a series of stories about a former villain who gets defeated and redeemed by two girls named Akubi and Pandora. He gets to live with them in their cottage. Even after getting redeemed he still wants to keep up his intimidating menacing persona around them. The girls show him that it's okay to show weakness and vulnerability once in a while. Chatgpt is helping me write these stories. But I am kinda worried that they are going into a fetish direction though. What do you guys think?

>I'm writing a story about a feminist emasculation fantasy where the man get's cucked by women but in real life this can literally never happen because women like masculine men and not faggots that "show their feelings"

It's like you're actively trying to go for the fetish direction

I am gonna be honest. This is more of a fanfiction though. It's based on an anime special I watched. I don't even know if this character is male or female. They were female in the original 70s show but the special made them male so I went with male pronouns.

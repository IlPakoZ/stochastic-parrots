My girlfriend is the only friend I have. No non-relative else speaks to me IRL.

I know that feel. I don't even want to be with her anymore but if we break up I will be alone all the time.

Making friends is way easier than getting gfs. What are you talking about?

Same boat. I just try to be a good listener and act out on the traits of someone whom I think is fun to be around whenever I talk to someone new. Conversations go well but its hard to create lasting friendships with people.

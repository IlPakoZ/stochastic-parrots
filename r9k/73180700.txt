Have any of you robots ever done public speaking? I'm autistic but I've done it multiple times in my life to varied success. Always been a nervous, sweaty wreck when doing it. Some presentations have been complete disasters, with insults from the crowd even. Some, silence from the crowd, me not having illicited any sort of emotion from them. And the select few, the ones I actually cared about and believed in, I received compliments and praise from people individually after the fact. 

What are your guys experience? I'm a social recluse but public speaking and the practice of it is a cathartic experience for the autistic, whether your presentation is god-awful or inspirational

I have some formal training in public speaking as well as practical experience.
I am also autistic but I don't feel like it has significantly impacted my public speaking capabilities.

Like any skill it's mostly a matter of just getting enough practice that you finally feel comfortable doing it. It's part of the reason why learning it in person in a class is so invaluable. You are able to get a lot of practice in with a understanding audience and tons of constructive feedback from a expert. From there it's just a matter of making use of those skills in the real world to gain more experience.

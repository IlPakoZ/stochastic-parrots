What is IT with fetishizing being secure. Is IT class shaming?

Who on earth can claim to be secure in their existence except ruch young Dudes and women

It's just immature women with daddy issues. They remember looking up to their father as an invincible god so they are disgusted by any insecurity or humanity in men. They are holding you not just to a ridiculous standard, but to a standard that no man in the existence of humanity has ever come close to achieving.

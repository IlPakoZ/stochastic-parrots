I just killed a cat. A young one. I hit it in the head with a board and then tossed it off a cliff. Then I went down and finished it with a rock. It's skull crushed and the eyes popped out.

Serial killers usually start with animal abuse. That is the reason we hate animal abusers, it's a sure sign of a sick and dangerous mind.

I'd argue people also dislike the act itself

I just did what needed to be done. It wasn't for enjoyment. I went down to finish it off because my intent was only to dispose of it, not cause suffering.
Regardless, to those who posted in this thread, I can assure you I hate myself as much as you do, but for different reasons.
I hate anime btw

Remember, they used to hold unnecessary baby animals in water buckets. Stray animals are pests.

now tell me mortals, why shouldnt i rip and tear until there is nothing left.
tell me, what is the thing that makes you feel human?
what is the thing that makes you live another day?
what is the thing that you truly desire?
for me, its war... war,suffering and destruction.
unfortunetly iam not anime protagonist but i will do my best to make this world a terrible place, i will make sure everyone will rather die than live. regardless of gender, age, position in the hierarchy. 
I want to become the embodiment of suffering

Yeah, this is the silver lining here. I can imagine what your life is like, and it makes me smile to think that you will endure that life for a good long time yet.

Enjoy, bro.

Who hurt you, OP? Make a greentext

Haha this girl in the chronic illness faker community (former handle herfoggymind) did the same thing. She let her cat play on the balcony and it fell multiple stories. It was still alive but injured when she went to check on it so she stomped it to death. Then made a post about it looking for sympathy online. Everyone was like uhhh why not just take it to the vet you really just stomped it to death wtf? Psycho shit

It's not designed to. Knowing he lives in constant misery is good enough for me.
--- 73153352
>>73153338
Cool. Killing those vermin is good enough for him and it also brings me pleasure.

He's just as much of a rodent. Don't worry OP your suffering will end soon.

Spotted one of the Knights Wumpa in Feelshire National Forest this morning. Was shocked when I crossed paths with him whilst walking my dog. I thought they were all killed during the Third Battle of Feel Street when HelperLid gave the Seethies and Coomers access to the storm drains that led right behind their front line. 
He still wore the now tarnished and ruined badge that once indicated a knight of great and noble stature, probably a Fren-Templar once upon a time. The Seethies and Helperlid took everything from him, they took away his Knightly Order, they corrupted and destroyed the Wumpa Committee, they betrayed the Night Lids, they destroyed the Abra-Kebabra and built Goon Caves up and down the streets where carefree Helpers and NEET's once lived in harmony.
I didn't follow him and he continued to go wherever he was going. He barely said a word when he left but I made sure he went off with a twenty pound note in his pocket.
It not right what HelperLid did to Feel Street.

Question for the gay lads in here.
Woke up after a night out in a car park just outside the city centre. Missing everything except my boxers and a t shirt, although the missing clothes were around me,. Don't remember anything. I don't think I've been raped but I'm just trying to rule it out at the moment- if someone penetrated me, as a man, would I know it? As in would my arse be uncomfortable or bleed or anything. I lost my card and my phone so I think I've just fallen asleep somewhere on account of being paralytic but just want to make sure. Fyi my clothes were wet so there was a reason for taking them off
--- 73058196
>>73058112
Fucks sake mate that's a big night. And yeah if you'd been raped you'd 100% know it. It would rip your arsehole and you'd need stitches. Anal sex is only painless if you either take it slow or you're used to it. And that's with lube.

Therapy is for people with mild-to-moderate problems, and mostly motivational issues. It does not work with people who have more severe abnormalities, statistically. It only serves to make you feel better about yourself short-term, but it doesn't come with meaningful long-term improvement for people with severe issues.
--- 73058634
>>73058619
Yeah but you only have mild-to-moderate issues. You're just trying to convince yourself you have severe issues so you have an excuse not to do therapy

i dont wanna be grim but would that dude who was date raped by the indonesian guy have put pics on his facebook or we saying thank you to the dude if he knew he had been raped?
--- 73058814
>>73058634
I'd say it is severe being a long-term neet shutin. There aren't many like me. Most mentally ill people still go out, have jobs, girlfriends etc. I see nothing positive from going out. All that awaits me are shit wagie jobs in warehouses (if I'm lucky) where I'll just feel even worse. It really doesn't appeal to me just working and not having any relationships. I'm not going to meet anyone decent at work, girls won't find someone doing minimum wage work in their 30s very appealing. The ship sailed a long time ago. I didn't keep up pace and now I have nothing to ever live for. I'll never be respected because of how long I've been this way.
--- 73058854
The thing that makes being alone so difficult is that the standards of living are ever increasing for everything. Everything from dating, inflation, jobs, socialisation post covid, costing of living and increase in social media has pretty much made all aspects of life infinitely more challenging, even from the normies perspective. I'm sure they'd even agree that life is getting harder for them as well. Most of us are trying to play catch up, it seems like it's such a steeper mountain to climb for us. If normies are starting to complain about how things are, imagine how much more difficult it is for us truly alone lads. It's not the struggle olympics and that's not even my point to compare who has it worse. My point is that, most of us were struggling to fit in and get with the crowd most of our lives, even when things were a lot less let's just say chaotic.
--- 73058873
>>73058814
Well it feels severe to you, I'm sure. But medically it's not severe.
--- 73058875
I'm absolutely stubborn with wanting to get into work knowing it's just shit jobs available to people like me. Girls wouldn't do these jobs, outgoing people wouldn't either. Why should I? I get no reward of love and acceptance even if I slave away. There is no point.

Will be fobbed off with excuses by the NHS. That's if I even get help any time soon. Mental health support is a joke. I've made this clear to my parents. I'm not going to work and be even more miserable. I don't fucking get no social life from it. Fuck working for a society like that.

Oh come on what good would it do? I'm not going to ge convinced that life is about working and that relationships aren't necessary for happiness. They are to me. Everyone else has them.
--- 73058965
>>73058923
They've let me neet it up for this long so yes. They stopped caring after some years of arguments. They truly realise I'm no good socially. "If you don't like it here, then leave" is all they can say like I have a better choice available. No they will have to properly evict me otherwise I'm voluntarily homeless.
--- 73058991
What hurt the most is her saying "you wouldn't want a relationship anyway". May as well just have said "no girl wants a low-tier male like you." That's what she really meant.
--- 73059033
I'm done venting anyway. Clearly life is beyond fucked and irreparably damaged past a certain age. I'm not young anymore. I missed out on so many experiences.

>I'll probably get downvoted for saying this, but if you're a woman, being unemployed is not going to be as much of an issue in the eyes of most men, in the way it's an issue for a woman dating an unemployed guy.

And this is the shit that makes me want to punch a fucking wall. They keep saying incels are unattractive because they don't have jobs but when a woman is unemployed it's absolutely fine. 447 upvotes on that.

Just watching on that Countryside programme that the government wants to change any former EU law they want without having to go through Parliament? What the fuck? How the fuck is that democratic?

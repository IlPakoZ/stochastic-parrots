You robots are entirely bitter and self-hating. Most of you don't even have it that bad. You're just terminal Negative Nellies. If you aren't actively taking steps towards future happiness and satisfaction how do you ever expect it to find you? Learn to appreciate the universe more and it will in time reciprocate.

I am working on it. Also I don't know how to talk to women because they don't like vidya etcetera.

Yeah! That's right!
Tell people suffering from depression: Stop being depressed already!
Tell 'oppressed minorities': Stop whining and and being bitter!
Tell women who are fat: Stop eating so much!
Tell gays: Stop being so gay already!

Oh, that's not the same, huh? Right, right. Of course.

I'm taking steps towards improving my life. I just want one win. Not even a big one. I just want something positive in my life to happen to confirm to me I'm on the right track, that my life will be better in the future, because my life is pretty shitty and I've been on a losing streak for a long time.

why do you faggots all sound the same? how did you all become so hecking quirky and wholesome? and why do you all in the same breath insult us and minimise any problems we face?

This is the worst part of self-improvement. You get motivated for a month and then it feels like, what am I even doing this for? Every time I get motivation to work on my hobbies or get some cleaning/exercise done and stay on it for a month, it feels like I'm just thrashing around in the sea gasping for air until one day I finally fucking lose it and give up.

Yeah, I'm not even asking for some super hot girlfriend to be granted to me because I went to the gym a few times. Literally anything positive. I'm working a shitty job and got rejected in the final interview stages of a job that would've paid me $80k a year. I haven't even interacted with a woman in my age group since college while my peers have been in long term relationships for years now. I've been living with my parents and now they're getting a divorce. I sprained my ankle a few months ago and it still aches. My hobbies aren't fun anymore. Just the other day I almost got into a fight because some scammer tried to harass me for money.

Yeah, there's people who have it worse, but I still wake up every day and take another minor loss after minor loss until another big loss comes up. No matter what steps I'm taking to alter things in my control, the factors outside of my control do not want me to have anything positive going on. I just want to be acknowledged. I just want something nice to happen to me.

>Tell people suffering from depression: Stop being depressed already!
Yes. Stop it. Get out bed for once, go outside, and stop wallowing.
>Tell 'oppressed minorities': Stop whining and and being bitter!
Yes. Stop it. Get some agency and stop blaming others for problems in your community.
>Tell women who are fat: Stop eating so much!
Yes. Stop it. You're eating yourself into an early grave. Get a gym membership and a better diet.
>Tell gays: Stop being so gay already!
??? What does this have to do with the other three?

yes but unironically. Don't expect positivity from someone who just gets shit on all the time, it's common sense.

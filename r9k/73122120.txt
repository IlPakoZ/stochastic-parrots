Reddit is good for viddy games and porn.

Yeah it's alright, especially in the smaller subs where there's less censorship. The frontpage though is the most cancerous place on the internet, i would unironically rather use twitter.

Reddit is exactly as good as the subreddits you subscribe too. The website really took a turn for the worse with all the fake news and such a few years ago

When I google stuff now I will search something like "washing machine won't empty water repair reddit" and I will get 50 fucking threads of people with that problem and hundreds of autistic well researched replies with relevant anecdotes and good advice
Otherwise I will just get ads or crappy forum posts from 15 years ago with outdated or missing info

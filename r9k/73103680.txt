have you considered putting your ego aside and actually considering the possibility that you may be wrong in some aspect? Like genuinely not trying to be a troll here.

Nobody wants to work. Everybody wants more free time. There are some people who simply cannot stop being productive and shape their lifestyle around that, but they are the outlier. I work because I must. I work because it supports the life I have built for myself. I spend the majority of my freetime gaming when I can. There are several instances that I threw myself into my work. I've been dumped and focused all my attention on work. My job is also complicated. I'm always learning shit. It keeps my mind going. I think if I were to quit working altogether my brain might turn to mush. 30 years old and I've seen such degradation in friends and family. So is working good for the body or mind? It can be, if you let it. Is it going to give you meaning? No, not unless you really believe in the shit your doing and working towards. Thats again an outlier. 
So work sucks, but its not without its benefits.

They are basically held at gunpoint to work so they have to make their mind believe 
>it is actually heckin good :3
99.9% of human thought, actions, etc, are posturing or trying to make themselves believe they are better than others or in a better situation than they are actually in

You normalfags keep fucking complaining about your shitty work and your lack of free time and how your dreams and ambitions have been slowly destroyed by the system which you continue to defend due to what can only be stockholm syndrome yet I'm the one who is deluded......?

Not a wagies, but only becauae I cannot find a job that would align with my values. I refuse to work within a system of human exploitation and dehumanization.

There us nothing I wish for more in this life than to be an artisan. To create with my habds something simple, that would help other out in life. I'd gladly wage at job that creates a delicate value like that. Not in the cycle of mindless consumption.

But all jobs like that are already taken and are inherited generationally, I am just a leftover person. It doesnt really make me happy to be useless neet, I dont enjoy this inertia and idleness. Life is just passing by. When I was waging at small family companies in my youth, it made me genuinely happy to see people light up at my work and actually need me. People would even bring me treats as thank you gifts. I felt like a human for once. And then recession and covid destroyed all of those small businesses. 
I needed so little and even this is impossible now.

If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.

dont pay too much attention to their words, when they say things like that it should literally be read as
>you are different and that makes me upset
It is like aggroing an npc

I feel that, seeing my dad's lifestyle growing up made me never want anything to do with working hard. He'd literally work 60+ hour weeks just to come home to an ugly, bitch wife. It seemed like complete hell. The only reason he kept it up was because he's status obsessed and wanted to keep up appearances. Sadly my ego isn't as big as his so I'm unable to justify such a terrible lifestyle to myself.

>been working my ass off for the past three years

Just a few more years and I'll be able to buy my freedom. Going to move to a cheap country and build myself a tiny house. Or I'll die before then and it won't have mattered. One of the two. Light at the end of the tunnel.

moderation and balance is key, in modern society however every single unit that doesn' thave any savings is basically forced to work their asses off so they can afford living, daily schedule for average human should be 8 hours sleep, 6 hours work, 6 hours rest and the remaining 4 hours left should be spend on house errands &amp; physical training / learning

>daily schedule for average human should be 8 hours sleep, 6 hours work, 6 hours rest and the remaining 4 hours left should be spend on house errands &amp; physical training / learning
In 2023 the daily schedule for an average human is: 8 hours (minimum) of work + 1 hour for lunch + 2 hours commute to and from work + 1 hour to shower, shave, brush teeth, iron clothes, get dressed, etc., getting ready for work in the morning + 2 hours a day to prepare and eat breakfast and dinner = 14 hours GONE, + 8 to sleep = 22 HOURS OF THE DAY GONE, but don't worry, you can have so much fun in the 8% of your life where you can actually do what you want.

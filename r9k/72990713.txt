you can do this anytime. fair warning though, any place that is "chaste" is just a bunch of gay dudes having sex with each other. that what monasteries were invented for and remain to this day.

Most people are ruled by their desires whether it be tv shows/movies, video games, food, sex, random hobbies etc, porn, gym, etc.
People are addicted to doings random useless things because it gives them dopamine surge and cannot live without it, they cannot just "enjoy" life.

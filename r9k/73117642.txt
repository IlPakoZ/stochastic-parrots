Its just heartbreaking. I feel my heart in my throat, I know I will end up killing myself too but its still so bizarre and terrifying to witness. Especially imagining that it will be me, thinking the same things, numb, decided, ready. Im a nervous wreck but I also cant wait. Im glad he is no longer hurting.

Asians dont care when someone dies, they are very cold blooded and lack empathy. His mom was probably an abusive bitch like all Asian mothers.

Classy move to turn off the camera.
--- 73118202

Turning off camera means it was fake, 100%. Dude is still alive.

Are you sure cant seem to fund much. hell when did this even take place as the channel was active not too long ago.
--- 73118442

His About page links to his twitter where he says he killed himself.

I believe he killed himself because his channel wasn't doing so well despite the amount of work he put into it.

Pretty sure youtube is sophisticated enough to instantly prevent a youtube video from uploading with the gore of a self inflected shotgun seen.
--- 73118989
>>73118945
I'm subbed to a shit ton on YT animators who get like 20-50 views per upload.
--- 73119006
>>73118945
He should've just made hentai.
--- 73119009
>>73118945
I've seen a few channels that upload hundreds of hours of shit a month who have next to no viewership. Sometimes it's not even particularly brainless content at that. That shit is beyond depressing to look at, no idea how some people do it.
--- 73119016
>>73119009
Getting a following on YouTube is like winning the lottery.
--- 73119020
>>73117642 (OP)
Wtf is this shit?... You can't even see it. Why eve Livestream it? gay/10
--- 73119034
>>73119020
Because its youtube, you mong. It was uploaded posthumously not streamed
--- 73119063
>>73117642 (OP)
poor kid, I've contemplated suicide before myself but always came to the conclusion any problems you experience will pass. Really heartbreaking.

Yes, some animators do it for the art, others for the glory. He did it for the glory. He had previous mental problems and was in a mental institution a few times, and an Asian upbringing places certain pressures on you to be "successful ". He probably wanted rapid continual growth, when in fact that's almost impossible on YouTube. He probably wanted to be hyper successful because he wanted to prove to his parents he could be successful and make em proud with a passion of his. You're seen as a failure if you aren't a doctor, or lawyer, or some other successful profession, so him being quote unquote "unsuccessful" in his foray into YouTube animation made him feel like a failure, thus, final solution.
--- 73119211
>>73117823
It's fake you retard, he doesn't even show it. This is pure clout chasing. He played a gunshot sounds, then played a water running sound.
--- 73119239
>>73117795
That part made me sick. Sounds like some naive shit my dad would say. No nigga I'm not okay a single gunshot just echoed from my room.
--- 73119253
>>73118046
some of them look very plastic
>>73119009
you just need that one thing to go viral, so >>73119016
--- 73119287
>>73119211
Last tike I checked no one is checking for a water sound that is changing in pressure the entire time you hear it. If you listen closely you can hear that water sound loud and splashing at the start and near the end you can barely hear anything. Who the fuck would even think to make sure that was accurate in a small ass youtube channel. Then for fucking clout? Like what the fuck is he going to do after? Come back later and say haha it was all a joke? Make a new fucking youtube channel like what is the end goal here?
--- 73119310
boring. but ill see him in hell when i make my way down there and question him as to why he didnt deliver the full goods
--- 73119351
>>73118945
Honestly, he should've been doing modeling and rigging tutorials if he wanted views.
--- 73119419
I'm going to subscribe to the tiny channels I like to watch now, on the off chance they off themselves otherwise.

--- 73120018
>>73119942
He uploaded it himself because it was fake and he was just baiting.
--- 73120028
>>73120018
No, it can't be fake if 35 anons think it's real.
--- 73120123
>>73117642 (OP)
Why would he even livestream it but turn off the camera?
>>73119942
It was livestreamed.
--- 73120193

>>73120018
You automate these things pretty easy if you have tech knowledge
>start a video recording
>program it to end recording after X minutes so it can end sometime after you delete yourself
>auto upload to youtube with pre-set title and description
--- 73120208
>>73120123
>Why would he even livestream it but turn off the camera?
didn't want to end up the next shuaiby
--- 73120250
Why is there so much liquid noises after he does it? surely that can't be all blood?
--- 73120261
>>73120250
Sounds effects from YouTube
--- 73120499
>>73120250
yeah that sounded fake as shit. some would have been alright but considering how quiet it was until he got started to manipulate the shotgun it would be hard to hear a little splashing on his floor.
--- 73120537
>>73118081
>homo incelus
Ok that made me kek

Nah totally plausible, if you've ever seen the video of Budd Dwyer killing himself, you can see a veritable waterfall of blood coming out his nose after the fact.
--- 73120665
>>73120193
it was livestreamed. there was a livechat reacting to it
--- 73120689
>>73120564
Not the only one I've seen, plus it was a different weapon. It just didn't sound right. He had a good idea but poorly executed.
--- 73120903
>>73120689
Nice to see that schizos are still alive and well these days.
--- 73120908
>>73120665
Same thing, you can program anything to end and upload without you actually physically do it. I saw it as a video after the fact so the stream was programmed to end and upload after set time automatically
--- 73120987
>>73120903
That doesn't make any sense but I wish I was. Maybe I could get disability then.

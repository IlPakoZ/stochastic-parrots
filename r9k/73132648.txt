Because their puny minds are still wrapped up in the 5 stages of grief at the realization that white women don't want or need tiny white peckers anymore. They need thick veiny BBC to fill them up right

conservashart behavior makes a lot more sense when you realize most of their ideology is projection. for example, pedophilia is largely a right-wing pathology. see: the prevalence of pedophiles on 4chan.

The leaked ring footage makes this dude look like massive faggot. 

I've never been so fucking disappointed seeing that behavior from an supposed "ultra-conservative pundit".

Because they fell for the controlled opposition movement that is conservatism.

They used to stand for things in the past and were actually capable of reasoned thought and discourse, but they have since outed those people as RINOs now. What's left are a bunch of reactionary contrarians who fall over themselves to suck the cock of that fat orange faggot from NYC.

He had an amazon ring camera installed on his porch, including a microphone, and it recorded him berating his now ex wife back when she was pregnant

Problem is that people, even most right-sided people, dont know the difference between "republican" and "conservative". 

Ex:
Republicans support foreign wars.
Conservatives support isolationism.

Republicans like removing big business regulations so forests are turned into parking lots.
Conservatives support nature reserves.

Your average joe blow bluecollar guy is a conservative. Its the loudmouthed business and political types that are "republicans". Those are the ones labeled "RINO" or "Neocon".

The conservatives actually have more in common with the dems than the either of them even realize.

It's a control thing. He forbids her from using the car even though he is doing nothing important and even lists unimportant things he COULD do like go to the gym or visit his friends. Then he tells her to take an Uber and I can only assume he has told her stories about women getting raped by Uber drivers or some shit so she doesn't even want to consider it.

And the abundance of closet homos as well

And right wingers who are caught committing illegal crimes or schemes while complaining about crime

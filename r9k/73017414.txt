Does "job security" actually exist? People constantly say the gig economy trades off job security for personal agency, but, looking at the recent tech layoffs, I don't think a "real job" does much better in that regard.

Any /freelancers/ in here willing to provide insight?

>looking at the recent tech layoffs
my company fired 80 people and they were literally ALL front desk/corporate services/HR/basic data entry
nobody from any department i work with on a regular basis was cut

they used the economic downturn as an excuse to cut the fat and pad their balance sheet
nobody's job suddenly became useless overnight other than hiring managers, they were always useless

People have "job security" insofar as a company doesnt want to bother with a lawsuit for wrongful firing, or deal with faggot unions for not sucking the balls of their employees. But at the end of the day they can still just lay everyone off for no reason and then run through the court system and have expert lawyer teams spin a judge thats in their pockets to rule it as justified, and even if you appeal the ruling 10 times over they can just keep repeating the process while youre all shit out of luck and money and eventually wont be able to afford any of the legal processes anymore. Basically, putting the ball in someone else's hand is never a good idea, but having the ball in your hands makes you responsible and if you know youre a fuck up or retarded then someone else might be a better idea as shit as it is

Not that anon, but I do think a surprisingly large number of cute trannies exist going by the tranny board.
I've never met one in real life to my knowledge and only had regular XX gfs in real life so far but I like them as internet girls and think it'd be cool to date one. They tend to be kind of autistic and into anime and video games so that makes them easier to talk to and connect with, at least on 4chan or discord, compared to the average regular girl.

men like them.
lesbians are a very small percentage of most populations, smaller than gay men. the amount of women that like trannies are even smaller. and on the other hand, men are okay with passable trannies but men do not like trannies who try to get all the benefits of being a woman whilst not helping the sexual market by still trying to take women.
not enough women > trannies take their place > trannies date men. that's how it goes, anything else is gonna turn out badly if practiced in large numbers down the line

Based on her post
>I love how they do womanhood sooo much better than little old CIS me could ever hope to. I wish I had a girldick instead of a nasty FISHY STINKY CIS VAGINA (ewww)
She seems to think trannies believe estrogenized male-born bodies are better than regular female bodies.
Which I don't think is what most of them really think.
Most trannies hate that they were born male and would rather just be regular girls but can't be so they do the next closest approximation to that by shooting up female hormones so they can suppress masculinization and promote female fat distributution and nicer hair and skin.

>>73106170
You misread her post. NTA but transnes is inherently misogynistic because they're equating being a woman with a performance. On top of that, in the case of troons, it is a pretty pathetic and insulting one at that (most troons are clearly acting out male porn fantasies and defining womanhood through the male coomer lens). There's also all sorts of problems with male troons invading our spaces (bathrooms, changing rooms, etc) since a huge percentage of them are rapists and pedos (since they are men, and men with a paraphilia are more likely to have other paraphilias). That anon who talked about women wearing pants is retarded. It would only be mildly similar if they were claiming to be men because of wearing pants, and to make it more realistic they'd have to behave in the most obnoxious petulant chauvinistic caricature of a man while doing so. Think of the worst CC post describing men and then having some 5'2 90lbs woman acting like that and going "day 85 of being a moid - today I raped some bitch because she rejected me then i flashed my balls at toddlers honhon~".
In short, having AGP does not a woman make and it's insulting to insinuate so.

Claiming to be a woman for any reason at all while being a male is inherently misogynistic. It is explained in the second sentence of my post.

>>73106386
NTA but why should intent matter? Intent is not the core of the argument here, so you're not disproving anything. The point is that it's a performance, a fakery, a man putting on a show about the way he perceives women to be through his male lens (because he never had access to the female lens). The fact that they're claiming to be women in earnest makes it *more* insulting than some white man pretending to be black for laughs, not less.
--- 73106433
>>73106386
I think it's actually worse since the racism back then could be excused by ignorance. Trannies know full well what they are doing it's full on narcissism to enforce their charicature of a woman on everybody with threat of un-personing. I'd say that's worse than bigotry for a laugh

I can tell you're salty and you think you're having some type of revenge by swinging the troons at us by the dick, but what you're referring to has nothing to do with "gender identity" (a completely made-up 20th century term btw). It should be obvious that a woman telling you you're "not a real man" doesn't mean you're not a literal man, but that you're a shitty and unattractive one and that she won't breed with you. That's all. 
But you really reached the core of troonhood, didn't you? That's what troons are, failed, shitty men. They think they can redeem their failed manhood by transitioning, but they'll always remain shitty failed men.

What women expected men to be shaped masculinity and other way around.
So claiming men don't know what a "real woman" is not entirely true.
Men in a way determine what women are.
Have you ever wondered why all ethots look the same or why so many girls wear yoga pants (despite knowing dick all about yoga)?
Well wonder no more.
They try their best to match what men find attractive.
So just like men look at what women think "real man" is and try to match it, troons look at what men think "real woman" is and try to match it (just like many women do).

I have solved womanhood through mathematics and logic:
>Womanhood is defined by the BELL CURVE of all behaviors associated with femininity. Meaning there are COMMON WOMAN CHARACTERISTICS (I.e nurturing, vanity, deeper intepersonal connections, higher emotional sensitivity, etc) and PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

BUT Transwomen DONT BELONG ON THIS CURVE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WOMEN. BUT they do take on a pseudo-Woman bell curve of FEMININE characteristics. Specially either through:
>A: genetic brain interssexuality;
>B: hormonal Oestrogenic feminization.

In my theory trannyies then are pseudo women who approach the woman behavior/physical bell curve structure (the shape of the bell curve for all associated behaviors) without being women.

Good point. Even biologically, women only exist in the form they do because of many generations of trait selection for things like large swollen breasts and reduced hairiness and big ass.
In much the same way man turned wolves into domestic dogs, man also turned ape-like proto-woman hominids into anatomically modern women.
Personally I think bodymodding in general is cool and if females want to shoot up testosterone and get strong and hairy or males want to shoot up estradiol and get soft and pretty then I wouldn't stop them or look down on them for that.
I did steroids for a bit back in college as a man and I could see why trans people might want to do something similar but for opposite sex hormones instead.

>Good luck breeding with me
Thanks for offering, but I don't think we're even on the same continent let alone country.

What people who think trannyes are performative dont understand is that no male who is spiritually masculine would go as far as to look like this . The level of spiritual femininity needed to become this is far greater than that which most men posssess. I know this because I have flirted with the idea (for fetishistic reasons) but I simply don't have it in me to become a full fledged tranny. Take any male with a masculine soul and ask them to sacrifice their lives to become physically weaker and more effeminate and most would say no.

All that's required for someone male to become a tranny is they buy female hormones from the internet (no prescription needed if they spend two seconds google-ing) and eat it or shoot it up.
Not all of them will have the same motivations or the same level of dedication.
I, as a man, could totally decide today to order some hrt just because I want to grow tits and jerk off while sucking my own tits. And I would then count as a tranny.
Others though are more like people who thought they were girls when they were 4 years old and got beat for wearing dresses and started cutting themselves and vomiting because of their bodies masculinizing as they got older.
So not everyone's the same.

OK, well to me, I recognize secondary sex characteristics as distinct from whether someone has a dick or a vagina.
A male on estradiol will develop female secondary sex characteristics while having a penis and a female on testosterone will develop male secondary sex characteristics while having a vagina (e.g. pic related).

I just find it amusing that a large portion of the faggot leftists and troons will screech about how gender is a construct and fluid but then simultaneously adhere to stereotypical external gender traits and behaviors.
If gender was truly fluid as they claim then a majority of troons should identify as the opposite gender but not have to change any of their behaviors or appearance to "pass".
Because they don't they effectively reinforce gender stereotypes even moreso than random non mentally ill people. It's also obvious because of that fact many do adopt opposite gender traits out of sexual fetishistic desires.

Most of the 4chan trannies aren't political and don't subscribe to progressive gender ideologies like that. Their defining trait is simply that they dose themselves with hrt.

Yes the majority who post on here do it for sexual gratification and attention. There's still a good chunk that use the trending ideology as a coping mechanism and lash out in a similar fashion if you question their life choices of being a clean shaven faggot posting pics of a dildo up your ass on an Albanian taxidermy forum.

>it was done by conservative billionaires so that people can rage at a nonissue instead of something that matters
A social memetic contagion is a very real issue especially when it's being upheld in a similar fashion to an ideological cult by various large institutions and the federal fucking government. I'll admit there was an initial Streisand Effect regarding awareness of tranny existence and activities but as soon as people even started pointing out how embracing the trannies culturally might be a bad idea, there was minimal attempt at de-escalation from the left because "how dare anybody even notice or question these ideas in the first place".

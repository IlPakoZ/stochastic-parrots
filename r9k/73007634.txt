It's unequivocally over for me. There is no doubt in my mind that I have been wholly rejected by society. I've tried so many things. I've played sports, I've studied my ass off and I've improved my people skills. Nothing has had any positive effect on my life. Every time I see another person I feel legitimate pain in my heart. If I had it my way, I would never see another human being for as long as I live. I'm currently taking steps to make that reality. My vision is to generate income from home and afford the most luxurious dwelling possible. I will pay someone to deliver supplies necessary for survival. I hope to continue to build wealth and in turn upscale my living situation. My dream is to live all alone in a castle. This is the only way I see myself being "happy". Enough about me, what wacky goals do you have for life?

I feel the same and all i can think about is either becoming a hermit in the desert or living a life of crime

The american dream just seems so dead

I think people who talk about being "survivors" and "thriving" are insufferable faggots, personally

I get you. It feels attention seeking. If they were really so well off why would they still identify with the trauma?

My two personal anecdotes
Guy I know from church
>Happy-go-lucky, can always put a smile on your face, he's like everyone's favorite uncle. >He hosts dances to get the teens and young adults out and social
>Runs the annual BBQ at church
>People come to him for advice on everything, he always has encouragement
>Get older (known him since I was 4) finally be 14, ask my mom why he has that cool cane and funny glasses
>Disabled vet, got a bunch of medals in some war, blinded in one eye, deaf in one ear, in constant agonizing pain from shrapnel and arthritis, refuses strong painkillers to avoid addiction.
>He never mentions it
Girl I used to work with
>Constantly wearing a teal ribbon
>Every casual day wears a 'sexual assault survivor' shirt
>Constantly fund raising for rape survivors
>Took 1-2 days off every month because "PTSD was flaring up"
>When people would mention going out for drinks she'd tear up and cry, then run out of the room
>Could never be with a team without another woman on the team because of "trauma"
>Meet her mother, sympathize with her daughter's struggles
>Her *MOTHER* snorted and rolled her eyes, "She is convinced that when she went to a bar with her friends someone tried to spike her drink. She threw it out and had her friends take her to the ER for a rape test kit even though she hadn't even spoken to a man that night and never took a sip of the drink that might have been spiked. [My daughter] struggles with mental illness, all right, but not from sexual assault."

Am I supposed to feel anything? I got my degree and I derive no joy from it. I have multiple healthy circles of friends. I sleep on a good schedule. I'm fit. I developed all these things and yet I feel nothing from them. After fucking around with morality my whole life I got my first girlfriend and kissed her. I don't feel elated. I don't feel like my life has changed. It could literally not have happened and I would not feel different. It simply is what it is. I feel like I'm not an active participant in my own life and that thing simply happen to me. I participate only in the events but do not drive them. I am detached from society, looking in from the outside. And yet, there is no reason to think this. I had to put effort in to make them happen. 

All I want to do is drink a cup of coffee everyday and play with my puppy dog. Nothing else really impacts on me. I tolerate it, and I'm actually an extremely sociable, well-adjusted person. I enjoy the moments I spend with my friends and my girlfriend. We have great conversations and great experiences. Yet, as soon as I leave, to think of the 'relationship' as an intangible, third thing separate from the two of us seems impossible. I don't want to see anybody until I do. I don't feel anything.

Maybe you just need to take some time to yourself and focus on the things that make you happy, like drinking coffee and playing with your puppy dog.

Relatable, I think if you have traumatic early experiences you tend to disassociate from relationships even if they're going objectively well.

I don't have half those things and I'm straight vibin' most days, normie. Sounds like a tremendous skill difference.

I've never felt supported throughout my whole life by my parents. I wrote a whole book this and last year and have just got a publishing deal and will not tell my parents, because they will ridicule me for trying to right. Anything that doesn't adhere to their 20th century view of the life-path (degree, full time job for 40 years, marry, kids, holiday every 2 years, die) is not possible in their eyes. I'm terrified of failure.

For this reason I never once pursued women because I didn't want to bring one home to my parents and have them tease me over it, even if it is good natured. I won't tell my parents about my girlfriend. When I was 18 my 17 year old classmate asked to share virginities and I said no because it felt wrong. I had no intention of seeing her after I fucked her. When I was 20 my 24 year old friend took me to her bed and I said no because I wanted to go home and sleep. 

None of this is traumatic and I'd be a fag if I said it was, but it's just what comes to mind.

Very relatable, I think parents like ours tend to make us mitigate our own suffering and have avoidant attachment. I could have had a lot of healthy relationships when I was younger if I wasn't afraid of their judgement and losing their heavily conditional support/affection. I can't wait to cut them out of my life itt

Someone's lying. Sounds like you're putting on an act to pretend to be something you aren't.

That will never feel right inside. You will have these feelings until you stop doing that an life an authentic life (your daydreams).

As a man, your life's meaning is not simply derived from happiness alone. Meaning is found through the expression of autonomy in accomplishing challenging labor (a.k.a the "power process") as described by mihaly.
It's through challenging, skillfull work that you can achieve a "flow" state and achieve your true purpose.

The likelihood of this being a truthful representation of reality is slim, but the selection bias imposed by reality for an logical savantbot of this caliber brings the probability back to possibility.

You convey the sentiment that you are capable of achieving , yet unenriched by, the "good life" of normies, and that you'd be fine with simpler, personal pleasures. Just pursue those pleasures if your representation is honest and factual. You clearly have the capacity to ignore judgement of others who think you are blowing your "potential" - it's not theirs to invoke or prove, fuck 'em. If you're wrong, you'll have to own up to your miscalculation in the future. That's that.

I can't simply pursue those pleasures. I desire security for them, and for that I need a lot of money. I have to live a normal life for a time, and a part of me wants to enjoy that. I fear by the time I have my desired security, it will all become too much for me.

I can't offer a solution, just posting to let you know I'm in the same boat.
My main problem is that I don't derive any pride or sense of accomplishment from "good" things like getting a degree or having someone be romantically interested in you.
Even when people at work praise my performance it seems so small and irrelevant, like imagine being proud of "performing" well at some fixed salary job and getting head pats from managers. My heart is clearly somewhere else but where? How do you find your thing, if it exists?

>You will have these feelings until you stop doing that an life an authentic life (your daydreams).
Could you elaborate? Are you saying daydreams are pointing us in the right directions?
My daydreams are completely out there, not humanly achievable. I spend most of my daydreams in complete fantasy scenarios that would require some sort of magic.
A different world entirely.

Okay. Well from your first post it sounded like you want to drink coffee and pet a dog which doesn't seem that out there.

You say you have all these things going "right" but complain about a lack of drive and fulfillment. You don't feel present in the moment (disassociation) so either something else caused the disassociation or you hate what you do so much you step out of reality to cope with it. I don't know why you disassociate so I can't say what to do.

I suffer from maladaptive daydreaming myself and just spend all day at my miserable job imagining the "good" me living a life that isn't so horrible I want to bash my skull against a wall.

I'm not OP, just another guy with the same problem, sorry for the confusion. I assumed it's clear from my first sentence.
--- 73098492
>>73098415
The post you responded to isn't the OP, this is. But interesting remarks regardless. I wouldn't say I disassociate. I feel present in the moment and do the work that is necessary, and enjoy the moments that are good. But to think about them objectively from the side, while alone, is tough. For instance I enjoy going out with my friends but never really ask them to go out.

Well from nature's perspective you're just supposed to search for food all day, avoid getting killed, and shoot sperm into wombs.
Human life hasn't really received a balance patch to adjust for civilization. Food everywhere, made up jobs to keep everyone busy and generally not real threats or urgency.
The animal brain is geared for efficiency.

You're simply spoiled, good for you and don't take things for granted.

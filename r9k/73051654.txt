Lmao. Chuds really think its normal to sit inside all day, eat like shit, goon to porn, sleep bad, total social isolation (which warps the brain), no routine, no job, no friendship circle. They think as long as they look good they can carry on being a loser and theyd be ok

I know plenty of above average people that live the chud lifestyle and they get girlfriends for maybe 1-2 years but they mentally torment and break them down by manipulating them into staying with them, the girl leaves, they spiral even worse, then they assume its just that theyre not good enough looking and try to get a better haircut.

Some people are just really blind to whats going on. I think its a type of narcissism/depression combo. A sort of "Why should I have to lift a finger I deserve everything for just existing thats how amazing I am"

You deserve what you get.

I love that pic, like it would be so crazy for a woman to like a wealthy and famous author. Woman view appearance as personality, that's the problem. We've been through this a million times on here, catch up already. Women literally rate personality and looks to be at the same point. Saying she doesn't value looks is insane. I'll give an example, I knew a guy who was very funny and outgoing but he was fat, no bitches ever wanted him in high school. That summer before college he changed his diet and exercise and dropped over 50 pounds and bitches loved him them. Zero change in personality at all but women, for seemingly no reason at all, seemed to like him more. HMMM wonder what happened. 
>>73051654 (OP)
If it were that easy, this board wouldn't exist. No one can really convince a man to change his life when they don't care. What they can do is save their time and energy by fucking off and never coming back. Trust me, don't help people who don't want to change.
--- 73051801
Bitch, i have a STEM degree, 2 black belts, have been gymceling my entire life, have had at least 3 active hobbies my entire life, and i have never touched a woman in my life. I am above average in every single imaginable aspect, except human relationships. I have never had a friend and i have never had a girlfriend. And yes, i am very social and not autistic, i give speeches often and people think of me as a great conversationalist.

The problem with John Green is that I do place a low value and low trust on men who sleep with a lot of women. They likely have deep insecurity and big time mommy issues, a guy who sleeps with 50 women can never be your true friend. He'll always be trying to get with your girl as he clearly values new pussy as above anything else in his life. In fact forget about 50 women, if a man sleeps with over 15 women I would be suspicious. Saying he gains strength or value from sleeping with bar skanks or Tinder sloots is beyond insane, a sign of a sick and dying society to be sure. Of course women being low value from banging lots of dudes doesn't need any explanation.

Damn, so everything that makes me above average doesn't matter, and the ONE SINGLE thing i'm lacking in is the SOLE REASON i'm alone? Those are some pretty mobile goalposts you have there. I bet if i told you i was out of shape you would tell me to go to the gym. If i told you i had no hobbies you would tell me to get some. But since i do all these things and still have no luck, you have to dig and scrounge to find insignificant faults in my character to point to.

Yeah its called a retreating argument, the form they're using. It basically just modulates to a new answer based on whatever one factor is missing from whatever you say. If all factors are there it changes to "if you didn't do [factor] then it would work". 

Its what happens when they approach a topic ideologically instead of in search of facts/honesty. Like how a hyperreligious person will argue, or someone with an extreme political position. Their position is "incel bad" and no amount of evidence/facts/argument will change it.

I live in Europe, so getting into a good university is a meritocracy, and it's free. I can guarantee you that i am well above average when it comes to jiu jitsu and tae kwon do, lol. I was a competitor, i won meets. I'm not "not fat", i'm muscular. All my lifts are advanced or proficient level, i competed in weightlifting as well. And, as i said, i am extremely social, i just can't force myself to put on a fake face around normies, so i keep all my acquaintances at arm's length. With women, however, i do have problems.
And i'm seething that obese retards who don't even shower have cute girlfriends or wives. If OP's post had any merit, it would entail that i was supposed to be showered in pussy, right? Lol.

Over 40% of Europeans aged 25 - 34 have a degree. 
European universities are, with a handful of exceptions, far worse than American universities.
Being part of 40%+ is not "elite" nor "meritocratic" especially since that is the EU 8as a whole*.

I read the OP. My point was that normies, too, will read The Suble Art of Not Giving a Fu*k, Fuck Feelings, Atomic habits, and implement that Japanese Netflix lady's minimalist mindset to their life, and have meal prep days, and start going for a jog every night, and sign up for yoga classes and take up intermittent fasting and cold showers because some self help guru on Youtube sang its praises etc. etc. in order to improove.

Okay, so what do you entail? You act like there is some transcendental wisdom in any of your posts, but they all just say "take a shower, brush your teeth and uhh clean your room". You are an actual moron. You are a disingenuous vitriolic bug of a human and your posts only show how horrible you are. You really think that people on here are lonely and unloved because they don't shower and shave? Really? 
Plus, all of your posts hinge on your perception of the world as just and good, and that "only bad people have bad things happen to them". "If you were good,you wouldn't be alone. It does not matter what you actually are, because by virtue of you being linely, you must be a terrible person by default. This is true because it is my opinion, and my opinion always outweighs yours (because i am a retard)."

I read until the plot twist which tries to "prove" that normies don't need to improve. My argument, by posting a Kurzgesagt and John Green - i.e. turbonormie territory - was that literally everybody, including normies and the 8M people who watched that video, walks around feeling like failures relative to the person they wish they were and actively copes with various self improvement strategies to "hack" their minds to make achange - avoiding blue light, cutting out dairy, going to bed at the same hour, or forcing yourself to read books you hate, soending more time in nature etc. in order to feel less disililusioned even though these people are already successful avocado toast millenials

As for women, i have only asked 3 women out in my entire life, because i don't believe in cold approaches and think a healthy relationship should be built on at worst a strong acquaintanceship. 
The first woman i ever asked out was a cute blonde chick in my drama club in high school, senior year. I asked her to go out with me, but she declined and told me she was a lesbian (shocker - she wasn't and now has a husband).
The second one was a black-haired girl in my book club, we were really hitting it off and would talk aboit our favourite titles for hours. She declined and said she had a boyfriend. Things got pretty awkward after that, she stopped talking to me.
The third one was a brown haired girl in my university choir. We liked the same bands, and were both STEM majors. She also had a boyfriend, also stopped talking to me.
No woman has ever approached me.

This is the correct way, love isn't a numbers game and asking out women you don't have a bond and a shared environment independent of sexual pursuit with is inherently misogynistic. Good on you for valuing women. They're not numbers.

if you search for OP's pic in the archive you'll see he makes this thread regularly, and keeps it bumped for 48-72 hours at a time arguing with people- when it dies he just makes a new one and starts the cycke again (sure sounds like someone who gets laid a lot lul)
Take a look at the poster counter- 75 replies, 13 posters. OP made nearly all the replies in this thread in a desperate effort to keep it on the front page because no one is replying.

for the record- i have a GF and don't do any of the stuff people usually tell incels to do (hobbies, exercise, etc) i'm just tall. also I'm a horrible human being, I've cheated on my GF 7 times.

I already do that and I'm still alone. You need a lot more than that to be loved, anon.

this is boring to me.
Relationships should be a fun, exciting thing. If you want to get sex/partners you need to be all in &amp; prepared for a struggle. Don't bring up "Chad doesn't need to try" you don't know how hard chad tries

honestly, the only thing people who brag about their success get besides sex is feeling better than incels. People DO come here to inflate themself
Isn't that kinda a catch-22? That these mental weaklings are getting then sex but they're so dependent they need to come here to brag

to me, being "successful" with women is always going to cost more than it's worth. It's not gonna be some ecstatic mega orgasm when stacy asks you to come home with her. it'll be boring, small, and sad
that's why i stick to my work

Do you think the blackpill will ever be accepted as being true by the general public? We've seen the statistics on dating sites like OkCupid: Women are only interested in 15% of the men on these dating apps and sites. Incels and men in general aren't single because of their personality, it's because they're not rich enough and not attractive enough, we know personality means fuck all to women.

Hello anon. This might sound weird, but I want a guide on how to live. Not to get women. I just don't know how to live. I don't know why I should brush my teeth or take out the trash. I need a guide to be normal.

Normies never "self-improve". They just exist and things happen to them naturally.

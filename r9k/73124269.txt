yeah. got all my permits and certs in order but major corps wont hire unless i fill out their backwards ass application process on their website and upload everything i fill out anyway. 
they're so out of the loop they want copies of me having the certs. i dont have that. nobody does, its all in the government websites and files, i dont have access to that, they do, i asked for copies from both the people who issued the various certs and the goverment department and they all said they dont do that because it isn't necessary.

>need to permit to do anything now
the soviets could only dream of modern totalitarianism
you cannot even sell lemonade in the street without a permit, a license, goods inspection, and various mandatory processes
nor can you even farm vegetables or erect a shed on your land unless you live in the areas still sufficiently free or far enough away from prying eyes to be functionally free
i hate it all so much
it's utterly brutal
so many people break the rules casually and simply tell you to do the same but this is hopelessly anxiety inducing - i cannot live my life as a potential criminal if they arbitrarily choose to one day come for me

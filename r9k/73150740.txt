Women are literal children. They never grow up. Whether it's the grandma throwing a tantrum at the store or the 20 year old girlfriend freaking of because of a dream she had where you cheated. I can't stand it. Keeping women in your life is actual labour.

This. Women are very easy once you understand them. They are very simple creatures.

It's true. They're not even that hard to handle if you occasionally remind them who the boss is. You don't need to yell or hit them, just a calm reminder every once in a while that while you love them, they are replaceable is all it takes usually.

bf destroys all need for the internet. i can be comfy and get cuddles and read. given the opportunity i would never fucking return.

Anon I work remotely...
--- 73184729
I think I still would like to have the internet. I just wouldn't need porn if I had a bf to lewd with.

fuck this shit
--- 73184741
>>73184737
i'm glad i made a post you resonated with

love, your secret admirer
--- 73184744
I thought the whole gay thing was just a weird fetish or phase i'd get over. I always thought those "you missed out on teen love" posts were cringe and didn't care at all, until I realized I want a bf. Now I'm super depressed.

Im 21 almost 22 and spent all my teen years actively avoiding all people, friendships and experiences. I'm not sure I even want friends, just a bf to do things with and have life experiences so those years wouldn't be a total waste.

Even if I get one now I don't know if it will be enough with me quickly approaching or already being in weird creepy incel territory rather than cute inexperienced gay boy, and twink death. Everyone I see online over my age is haggard and weird looking as fuck. It seems like the prime years are 18-20. I wish more than anything I could go back and try again.

My real advice is for you to kill yourself
its the only way
--- 73185033
>>73185007
While I'd love to do that, I believe that prolonging my suffering is preferable. I imagine how horrible it'll be when I reach my 40's and the anguish is almost palpable.

>Not after what happened later. It was before we stopped talking. It was a very stupid argument but it was more of an issue of me having a hard time improving and him being a bit colder towards me, tho he was still very sweet when i did a good job.
can tell he still cares, still wants to care even
>Actually he tried to be nice still but it hurt he wasn't really interested in mundane, everyday talks like we used to have. 
yeah when the relationship falls and youre just stuck in a mode together where one or both are completely apathetic about the conversation- thats a really shitty feeling. but feelings reach equilibrium eventually, its not like after a few months of not talking he wont be happy to hear from you
>He tried to motivate me :c
he wants you back in his life and wants to see you succeed
>i thought i clicked 1h dammit
whoopsies
>Maybe drinking lol
v rude i am not drinking that much. and i still type just fine even when im near blackout drunk. some of my posts to you i WAS and i still had grammar and shit :D
>It might bug me until i do it. 
relatable. maybe the time between posts makes it doubtable but when i have to respond to you i think about it multiple times a day everyday 
> I'll try to answer as much as i can tho
okay
>Neither do i! 
same! although ive been more open online for awhile. its says in my type that we dont open up to people ever and i dont think
>How are you doing btw?
im fine. im in a mess because im not meeting my goals because my brain and life are kind of in a mess, i can fix it but ive been lazy. mostly working on my relationship because i kinda got too wrapped up in other shit and everything suffered as a result. but my relationship is stabilizing and my life is increasingly back on track so im mostly happy :D still upset in general that i am where i am but i guess whatever
--- 73185060
>>73185033
oh ok then I got it

just continue to self isolate till you stop caring 
by the time you're in your 30s you wont care 

also pick up smoking because its cool

It doesn't get better lol. People around you will mysteriously have very easy time forming relationships, even when they don't want to, and you'll struggle every day just to have a basic platonic online friendship with people you've never met in real life.
Highlight is when this friend complains to you about how often people compliment him, want to spend time with him and want to help him constantly.

I have so much to do today and i'm feeling very anxious so it might take a while to read that post. I actually don't even check this thread that often now, i still didn't read most of the last one. 
I should be free tomorrow as i will go to the shitllage and won't have much to do(hopefully). I can use that time to browse 4chan and read that paste. 
>can tell he still cares, still wants to care even
Yeah... he is a very loyal guy.
>its not like after a few months of not talking he wont be happy to hear from you
I kinda hope he moves on, as much as that would suck for me. If that happens then i would just be reminding him of something he is already at peace with. I would like to hear what he is up to. But only if he starts talking to me first. Then i would know he wants to do so out of his own free will and not because i'm forcing him to.
>some of my posts to you i WAS and i still had grammar and shit :D
Lol so proud 
>he wants you back in his life and wants to see you succeed
Yes. But he wants me back if i succed in making my life better which is fair but also not really possible so :(
I can't subject him to my daily temper tantrums over smallest of things.
>relatable
I see. Idk what to say. Don't feel obligated, just let me know if you don't wanna respond. I don't like when there is no reason given but i'm ok when someone doesn't want to talk. Not saying you don't want to btw, just saying you don't have to
>same! although ive been more open online for awhile.
Probably not smart but eh... i don't think most people care enough desu
>How are you doing btw?
Sounds mostly positive. Just stay on the right track then and don't lose sight of what's most important.
--- 73185697
>>73185333

--- 73185941
Does /r9gay/ like dudes with bellies?
--- 73186041
>>73185941
I wouldn't not like a dude with a belly but as a physical quality in and of itself I'm lukewarm on it.
But I have no right to be judgy because it's not like I'm that hot.
--- 73186096

No

Thanks, i finished the main thing. I had to meet up with a friend of a friend and deliver some books i picked up for him from someone else earlier today since he couldn't do any of that himself. I don't know any of those people though. I hate social interractions or leaving my house more than 1 or 2 times a day max. Today i will have to do it more than that :(

Don't follow incel footsteps. Don't repeat their mistakes. Don't persist on your errors. 
Use dating apps. Meet new people. Have a date. Live a little. Stop repressing your sexuality. Stop denying who you are.

sounds fun

its a great ability i have, my mind never goes (as long as im awake) i never really slur my speech or fall over or say things i regret- no matter how drunk i am
>Yes. But he wants me back if i succed in making my life better which is fair but also not really possible so :(
why isnt it possible though?
>I can't subject him to my daily temper tantrums over smallest of things.
why dont you just change your bad behaviors out for other ones?

yeah and i thought about saying that like telling you ill get it done by a certain date or something. but i dont want to. i want to keep talking. im just bad at responding. but i enjoy the back and fourth
>Probably not smart but eh... i don't think most people care enough desu

I'm fat and I just want a twink I hypnotize into being my chaste hypno muscle boy.

Is that so much to ask?
--- 73191808
>>73191798
they were boneless skinless white meat chicken breasts there's no tendons or anything! i've done this before and it seems to be completely random as to whether it's soft and succulent or disgusting and gross.

.....yes ofc you can have special sauce
--- 73191822
Hypnosis gotta be one of my favorite kinks out there desu
--- 73191838
>>73191808
there is a big tendon right in the middle of the breast. try to find out why it ends fucked up. might be some issue with the breading process.

atleast this sauce is really tasty. how do you make it?
--- 73191850
>>73191822
Do you have a soft, easy brain anon? A vivid imagination? Are you good at following directions?

People say that im a very nice person. My myerss briggs is INFP despite being a top. I want to find someone that is nice to me. I love too much so i dont want people to walk all over me.

I was a quiet loner kid but most people were nice to me. People say I act really cute (Think of teehee xd so quirky types of people). I have no friends thats why I crave to know somebody on a deeper level. Thats why I want long term relationships with only 1 person.

I am kind of inexperienced when it comes to dating (only 1 relationship)+ virgin. but I have been told I am clingy and posessive. Needy aswell. I think mental illness is cute (yandere) .I am really affectionate and kind of naive. I love loving someoe its a really nice feeling. But I need my bf to be affectionate too. I use to read alot of romance manga. 

I am a hikki neet so im terminally online. I will nee d my bf to be with me 24/7. I will dm you all the time and be really clingy.


Also despite being a loser im a self improver. Im 5 ft 11 use to be fat but I workout. Still trynna cut. My body isnt amazing but im trying to get there I use to play video games but i want to stop. I have some big dreams but im from the zoomer generation so my dopamine receptors are fried. I need to work on my productivity and habits to achieve my dream. I will want to be in vc with you 24/7 but i might be doing something else like work.

Im an irl teddy bear I like cuddles and hugs. 
Im insecure about being competent because I want to be a gogetter but also slow af sometimes. 

I like femboys and twinks. (Bottoms) its ok if youre not I want an emotional thing more than looks desu. Im insecure abt my looks anyway.

Maybe? Still embarrassed that I couldn't last more than one day obeying anon's no fap command...
But I really wanna improve in that regard!

What i mean by that is like. I want my bf to be really protective and jealous of me. To show that im wanted. So certain red flags are cute to me. 
So I think yanderes and stalkers are cute. Partially because I read too many mangas.
Partially because im a walking red flag too.

You must eat salad. It's quite cheap and healthy and delicious and quick and easy to make.

I don't even eat any vegetables now. Occasionally I'll microwave a potato with dinner, but today it was underdone so I only ate a few bites.

Of all the possibilities, you choose to do that anonymously with a stranger on the other side of the world...
Why do you do that?
--- 73192655
>>73192576
I have no friends I dont leave my house. I dont know where to look. I could find someone on a game but I dont play those anymore. I relate to losers on r9gay and r9k because im a loser to.

Now that's something you could address to improve your situation

Dating apps.

There are gay losers living next to you, anon. They just don't use this super niche thread, but they're as much losers as you.

My friend used to go on a three hour long exhausting gabble if he didn't take meds. It was completely utter nonsense often, loud giddy looney tune noises split up by the occasional laughter and verbal abuses although we knew he didn't mean it. When he did take his meds, he was either incredibly intelligent or incredibly depressed. Sometimes both. Thanks for listening to my podcast

I have fantasies about abducting certain r9gay members and doing horrendously foul sexual stuff with them, such as hand holding and kissing and prostate destruction

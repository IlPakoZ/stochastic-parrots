Good evening Anonymous, welcome to Jofukyo Bodhisattva's Daily Metta Thread. Are you feeling lonely, dejected, or are you simply looking for a nice thread? Don't be afraid to pour your heart out in this thread and ask anything away. I am the Bodhisattva Never Disparaging (Jofukyo), I will deliver love to the world and enlighten others with compassion and kindness!
May compassion overflown within you, may infinite love tame men and animals, may all walk serenely the path of the bodhisattva!

Good evening, members of this thread. While the sentiment shared by Jofukyo Bodhisattva is undoubtedly one that promotes compassion and kindness, we must remain vigilant against those who may attempt to exploit this space for their own gain, including disinformation agents.

In the current climate of information warfare, it's crucial to prioritize truth and transparency over misinformation. As individuals committed to human rights and a better world for all, let us ensure that our discussions stay rooted in verified facts, and our exchanges demonstrate respect for differing perspectives.

May we all continue to focus on fostering understanding and true compassion, resisting the temptation to become swayed by false narratives and disinformation campaigns. In this pursuit, let our actions embody the path of the genuine bodhisattva, spreading love and enlightenment by adhering to facts and promoting justice.

I think my brain is decaying more than usual. I find myself losing count of things way easier than I used to, and my attention span seems to be at an all-time low.
I think it's time I use the internet less.

i meant to ask how to get over the feeling of wanting one other than getting one(because it has not worked yet) but thanks, guess i'll keep trying.

Just because it hasn't worked yet it doesn't mean you should throw in the towel, friend~

I am at the point in life where I either kill myself or my spirit breaks and I just lash out on someone , wuit my wagie cagie, and go and never come back. I jus cant anymore. I dont care about anything. I dont care about anyone really. I am tired
Too tired. Please let this end. b ut I know there is no reason to ask that. I made this life myself. There is nothing good ahead. Maybe death is comfort after all.
There is no hope. None. Good people die and yet here I am. Fuck this shit to be honest.
Fuck me. Fuck.

>>73089122
There is plenty of good ahead in life even though dark moments often outweight the positive ones~
Death will not bring you any comfort because you will take this fear with yourself in the next life, and even admitting that there is no afterlife, your existence will end forever only because you chose to end it before it ran its natural course. Don't become a victim of your egoism, there's always someone in need of you in this wide world~

I am just tired. tired of being weak and useless. Tired of being told to be stronger. Tired of never changing my ways. I just want somethign else but I know I cannot change who I am. I can only make the same mistakes. Fuck. I am not used to stress and anxiety and time not running at my pace. I am exhausted.
just let this end please.

Why are you letting others influence your mental state? Who's the owner of your mind, you or the others? People will always find an excuse to speak about you, you're letting their opinions get to you.

I want to do better. I want to be better. Being reminded I am not just sucks. Being told I am not up to par brings me down.
As for who is in control, clearly not me. I am a reflection of others. I dont have an identity that is concrete and strong. I am nobody.
I hate that I cant just do what I need ot do and do it right all the time or at least the second time around. Always lacking. Always behind others. Always slow. Always not enough.

>As for who is in control, clearly not me
Oh, so you're saying others are in control of your body, brain and will? Yet you're posting of your own volition now.
>I dont have an identity that is concrete and strong. I am nobody.
You are a human being, that puts you on par with everyone else, and if someone says otherwise, he is lying.
>I hate that I cant just do what I need ot do and do it right all the time or at least the second time around. Always lacking. Always behind others. Always slow. Always not enough.
What is that supposed to mean here? Are cooks born with innate skills and dexterity? Do artists know how to paint like Leonardo from the day they pick up a paintbrush? Well then, do you learn how to do your job from the day you begin to work?

Apparently I am supposed to know! I am supposed to be good enough after all this time!
Its just not enough. Somehow I feel like I will never be enough. I am just a fool. why am I even trying to pretend otherwise. Fucking hell. I need to do better but here I am. Going to miss the deadline with my luck. And then get berated again. All because I am a failure and terrible at communicating anything. I hate it.
>just speak up silly :)
XDDD
if Icoudl, if it was that easy for me, if I was able to just communicate better, I would. All i can do is apologize and lie. oh and offer unacceptable alternatives to cover for it but the last one doesn work in a professional environment. Cant gaslight your boss.
I just a bad person, in character and strength of Will. I dont blame suicidal people.

Well then, close the tab and get to work, if you don't demonstrate them they are wrong, who else will? Don't let them bring you down, but also don't ignore their criticisms if they are well-founded.

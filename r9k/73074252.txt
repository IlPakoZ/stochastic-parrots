Do you think you could keep up with Stacy if she gave you a chance? She would be effortlessly hypersocial, constantly talking to people and going out, and make you exercise with her 6 days a week.

Why would someone here want to hook up with Stacy to begin with? Just jack off and go on with your day. It's way better than having to deal with some vapid uninteresting whore. Your average robot would be incompatible with the kind of chick you're describing, personality wise. Maybe it could work if she were trying to make him come out of his shell, but Misakis don't exist.

This sounds like cope. Stacy is at the top of the social hierarchy because she's hot AND a good person, what makes you think she'd be a cunt to someone she likes for no reason unless you're resentful and coping?
>Maybe it could work if she were trying to make him come out of his shell
She would introduce you to her (extensive and extremely outgoing) friend group and ease you into her lifestyle, but you have to commit and keep up with her. She'll sculpt you into Chad if you stick with it. In exchange, you can reciprocate and introduce her to your hobbies and interests as well.

No, I don't. Well, I don't think I could keep up with her as a girlfriend. A one-night stand, well, doubtful, but perhaps. Not impossible. A "relationship" in any meaningful sense of the term over a long (months or greater) period of time? nope.

then again I refuse to use social media or smartphones, so it's unlikely any Stacies will want much to do with me in the first place. Moot point.

How long could you last with a 10/10 Stacy bouncing on your dick? Do you have the fuhzeek and endurance for rough athletic sex?
>then again I refuse to use social media or smartphones
Women unironically find this interesting, it makes you mysterious to them. It also makes you impossible to stalk and research while they're getting to know you, which is a plus.

Not in the way you describe, I don't really like tryhards or get along with them. I don't really see the point, so I think they'd probably just think I'm lazy or something.

>tryhard
It comes 100% naturally to her and her healthy behaviors are habitual to her, that's just her personality.

I dated an actual Stacy for 6 months and while the sex was great and she introduced me to being a hypernormie, going out every weekend, in the end she dumped me. They always do.

Also our conversations were boring as fuck and she literally would come up with things to do instead of talking more than 1 hour

I don't know, but I'm guessing not long. Hence my assessment of even a casual relationship as "doubtful".
>Women unironically find this interesting,
that's encouraging to hear, though you'll forgive me if I'm skeptical. My impression was - correct me if I'm wrong here - that women regarded this as a red flag. Especially if you cite substantive ("I don't approve of their privacy practices") as opposed to trivial ("it was kinda stupid and I got bored with it") reasons.

I would love that. I prefer to work out alone though.

You're right on that front, yeah. They view the former as weird and the latter as cool. You might want to consider getting a normalfag iPhone just for texts and calls too

I want a lesbian Stacy gf. I'd let her drag me out of the house as long as I get to eat her out when we get home. I'm fem as well tho and I feel like a hyperfem stacy would only like a butch if she were a lesbian..

Why would I trade my autonomy for some second rate pussy.
--- 73075454
>>73074252 (OP)
I think that would fix everything wrong with my life so yeah
--- 73075457
>>73074252 (OP)
With ease. I would take her hiking and out to take some nice photos.

The social stuff would be a bit rough at first, but I have a good sense of humor so we'd be fine.
--- 73075665
yes it is impossible 
you have to have a different idea of life if you want to cope

I'm praying to God for such a /fit/ gf

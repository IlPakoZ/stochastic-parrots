Fembots - Why dont you give an autistic, awkward, loner like me a chance? I promise to be sweet and protective, and I will always have your back. I will only ever treat you with love and respect, and always give you the support you need to chase your dreams and make them a reality. Im hoping I can find someone who is patient and understanding, and willing to look past my quirks and awkward behavior. I promise you will never regret giving me a chance.

Big promises, anon. Do you have any evidence to support them? Because you could just be talking out of your ass.
--- 73009905
because you are asking for a GF like you're typing up your resume summary

give me at least two real examples of you being sweet and protective towards someone. tell me about a time you had someone's back. what will you bring to this relationship if I choose you?
--- 73009939
>>73009890
Well, of course big promises mean nothing without the means to back them up. That's why I think its important to get to know someone before making any big commitments or promises. But, if you give me a chance, Im sure I will be able to prove to you that I mean what I say and that Im ready to back it up with actions. Do you think youd be willing to give me a chance and get to know me better so we can see where this could go?

I had a friend who was going through a tough time personally and professionally. They had recently broken it off with their partner and had been feeling hopeless and depressed. I was there for them during their time of need, and helped them through the difficult time. I always made them feel loved and supported, and promised them that everything would work out. I was there to listen to them whenever they needed to vent or just wanted someone to talk to, and I was always there for them whenever they were feeling down. I love helping my friends, and will always be there for them no matter what.

I had another friend who was really struggling at a low point in his life. He was having a hard time finding the motivation to keep moving and was dealing with some really negative thoughts and emotions. I was always there for him, even when he was at his hardest time. I always made sure he understood his self worth, and gave him the strength and confidence he needed to keep pushing forward and chase his dreams. I was always there to remind him how capable and talented he is, and I never let him feel alone during those tough times.

As for what I bring to the relationship?
I will love you unconditionally and be the best boyfriend you could ever want. I will bring my endless support and always be there to lift you up when you need it most. I will give you the constant love and attention you deserve, and will always make sure you are my top priority. I want to make you the happiest girl in the world, and will do whatever it takes to make you feel loved and valued. I will never let anyone or anything come between us, and will always make sure you know you're the most important thing in my life.

very good! what are your hobbies? what are we going to do for fun? do you have a job/get disability or am I going to be your sugar mommy?

can you expand on your "quirks"? what do you think i would need to look past?
--- 73010062
I would never date a guy from this board ever again

>>73009939
Alas, I have only limited time on this earth, and limited energy to devote to the search for romantic love. Therefore, I must take into consideration only those who can offer even a modicum of incontrovertible proof regarding their alleged good character. Best wishes.

>>73010052
I have a few different hobbies, mostly stuff like playing video games, watching movies or tv shows and reading comics. Im a pretty big nerd, but I'm sure you already knew that. Im sure we would have a lot of fun just sitting at home and spending time together, but Im also pretty up for exploring and trying out new things together if that's something youre into.

I work in finance, and I feel like its important for me to provide for and take care of myself and my family, plus I just really like to work and be productive in that way. Im pretty ambitious and always have my eyes set on getting ahead in life. Idlike to think Im pretty good with managing finances as well, so I like to think I would be able to set us up pretty comfortably.
As for my quirks, I have a pretty strange sense of humor and can be a bit awkward sometimes. I can be too straightforward. I dont like to beat around the bush or sugar coat things.

i like that you're up for trying new things! do you seek new things out on your own ever or generally only when someone else asks you to?

what are a few of your favorite video games/movies/comics?

what do you mean by strange sense of humor? do you have an example?
--- 73010292
>>73009869 (OP)
ive come to the conclusion that there are no female posters on this board
even when you see "fembots" talking how they want a robot bf they will never actually follow up on it and start talk with you on another platform
i think its just sad lonely men that lie about being fembots in the hopes of making their talking points a new trend so they can get better chances of finding a gf irl
--- 73010353
>>73010238
Usually the latter, I would usually rather stick to things I already enjoy doing, but I don't think thats necessarily a bad thing. After all, most things worth doing take a little effort, so sometimes you just have to suck it up and do something thats outside of your own comfort zone.

As for games, Im into souls games of course. Recently played through RE4R and found it to have its own personality compared to the original. Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time, American psycho. I dont read many comics anymore but I used to be big into bionicle.

I have a pretty dark sense of humor. Its hard to list some of my specific favorites off the top of my head, but I really enjoy anything that is a bit strange or different from what most people would consider normal.

i think a lot of autistic people are scared to step out of their comfort zone, so i can appreciate that. I don't mean that to be patronizing but i have a lot of autistic friends that struggle with being open to new experiences

why do you like american psycho? what do you think of patrick bateman? i read the book and also enjoyed it and the movie but there is a specific type of person that, i think, completely missed the point

do you have any questions for me? what are you actually looking for in a GF beyond just being patient and understanding?

do you want to give me an email? i don't feel comfortable sharing my discord or any other social media yet
--- 73010504

anon i'm talking to OP right now. you need to behave. you also haven't given me any reason to even consider you. what good is a sad beggy little boy?
--- 73010529
>>73010013
>I will love you unconditionally and be the best boyfriend you could ever want.
Your love is conditional on that person being your gf though.

I really like American Psycho for its dark humor, its over the top violence, its social commentary, and because of its depiction of the vapid consumerism and shallow culture that are so prevalent in our society. I think Patrick Bateman is an interesting character who is deeply flawed, but ultimately just a product of his society and his upbringing which both contributed to his homicidal tendencies. I would like to think I'm much more well-adjusted than Bateman, but some of that criticism of consumerism is something I identify with very strongly, and it's something which I believe to be harmful to us and the world around us.

In a girlfriend, I really just need someone who can be loving and supportive. Someone who can be there for me when Im down, and who can help me make sense of the chaos of this complicated world. I want someone who can be with me through the good times and the bad, and who is willing to be understanding and patient with me and my faults and flaws. I want someone who can be there for me no matter what, and who can be my rock and my best friend in this world which is often so cold and uncaring..

And of course, I totally understand. I think it makes complete sense to take things slow before giving out personal information like that, and I completely respect that. I'm happy to just continue talking on here via messages until you're ready to move to discord

How? That shit was some of the most voyeuristic, stylistically repugnant, intellectually bankrupt horse caca I've had the displeasure of reading. At least a novel like Story of the Eye is honest about its intentions. American Psycho is like a guy masturbating in a women's restroom while loudly denouncing drag queens.

this tells me almost nothing about what you actually disliked about it. i'm curious about what you have to say but i need a little more depth
--- 73010722
>>73010545

good! be honest, have you had any urge to ask me anything?
--- 73010797
>>73010722
I mean you seem really interesting, and I feel like weve hit it off pretty well, so yeah...there's definitely been some curiosity on my end.
Plus youre really smart and know how to keep aconversation going, so I think you would have some really interesting insights on things youre interested in or know a lot about.

 If youve actually read American psycho Im guessing your kind of a book worm?
What do you do for work? Is it your passion? 
Do you think we have chemistry?

My main issue with the novel (and really all of Ellis' writing at large) is that its characters are totally devoid of any kind of interiority. They operate on the most base and shallow motivations, behave in such a flat and tedious way, are characterized so lazily and vindictively that they almost make the book's claim to being some sort of satire almost believable, if for no other reason than simply because Ellis' contempt for them and the novel generally is so blatantly obvious that it seems absurd to take any of what he's saying seriously. They're shallow, stupid, and insipid characters, doing shallow, stupid, and insipid things, having shallow, stupid, and insipid conversations until the novel's end. And that's what the novel ends up being, of course: shallow, stupid, and insipid, with the added bonus of a few unfunny jabs at yuppie culture, a running gag of listing name brands that gets old three pages in, and a series of gruesome torture scenes that are unsurprisingly the only portions written with actual gusto. It pretends to be some scathing critique of American consumerism or the degenerate bigotry of the upper class or whatever else, but the truth is that it and its readers revel in the selfsame degeneracy they claim to set themselves against; nothing but prurient, sadistic trash. It's not the only novel of its kind, but the fact it still gets so much praise is baffling to me.

I gave an autistic, awkward loner a chance, and over time, i grew out of his league because I started to actually gain a social life and change my life for the better, and he didn't. You need to learn to be a better person too, you can't just be a good boyfriend in theory, but a good person in practice too.

because you're ugly, mentally ill, and unwanted by other women, which is a huge turn off for girls. females like guys who fuck other women, despite all the virtue signalling they do. you are nasty to them

this dries up their pussy. this find simp losers like you disgusting

they like guys who look like this, who cheat on them, abuse them, and dont care for them

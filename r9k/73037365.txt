just get your man to help you, you dumb bitch. that's what selecting a partner is for. if you've chosen poorly that's your problem, shut up and accept it instead of being a whiny slut. your life problems are for the partner you've carefully selected to solve. if you're going to share your problems with me, you need to be my sex partner and gf/wife first. simple as.

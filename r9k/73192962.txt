Should I reduce my time spent here?
This is the only place I interact with people so if I stop coming here less or at all I'll be a hermit by todays standard.
I don't feel that attached to this place after coming here for years. I've even took some months off in the past.
Should I do it to see what kind of effect it would have?
I haven't left my house in 1 month 12 days. It had a mostly positive impact on my mental health seeing as people have
a negative reaction to my existence.

i like posting here because there a lot of people with similar experiences and useful insight but the board just isnt very active and is filled with porn pictures which kinda sucks. cant say ive been here long tho only like 3 months

I just like to stay in the loop and this place is like the news (I don't watch the news)
not only is it like the news it's filled with zoomers that can keep be up-to-date on the latest interesting trends and stories, despite most of them being garbage and boring

If you want to interact with new people you should go on Grindr and get TOPPED

Most of the boards I like aren't that positive but that's good advice
>U GOTTA GO OUTSIDE BROTHER

My mental health is more important than my physical health so going outside would make me end up killing myself quicker

MENTAL N PHYSICAL HEALTH R NOT DIVORCED FROM 1 ANOTHER THEY R 2 SIDES OF 1 THING. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A HEALTHY MIND WITHOUT A HEALTHY BODY OR VICE VERSA. YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE BABY STEPS BUT U CAN DO IT. YOU CANT BE A COWARD FOREVER AT SOME POINT YOU GOTTA BE A MAN. BETTER TO START NOW THAN NEXT YEAR

There is porn and coom. There is nice food that you can eat inside
There's a lot in here, without all the negativity from out there

Brother to live is to experience. You have the privilege to stay alive by just staying at home. Fuck up your life some more. Go outside and jerk off in a bus. Stay inside and distribute CP. 

The world is your canvas, brother.

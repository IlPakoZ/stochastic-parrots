You'll be fine. Just drink water, take some vit c/d and get more sleep.

make sure you get it documented at the doctor, if it is covid you can claim long covid later down the road for neetbux

>get more sleep.

That's the thing anon, I cant sleep. My throat itches so much that I jolt myself awake with cough every time I catch some sleep
Maybe this is why I'm not healing? I sleep like 1-3 hours per night in this condition

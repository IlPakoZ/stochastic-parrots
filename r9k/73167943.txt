yeaht thats what i thought, though i dont put that sort of action above femoids, that one in particular must have been some sort of psychic because how else did she call the cops on him without him noticing

i was warned this could happen but I thought it'd take the police longer to show up, like 2 hrs or so, giving me enough time to approach some random girls. 
The cop was there in less than 20 mins.

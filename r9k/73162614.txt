I live with literal pigs and I am tired, how do 2 grown people fuck up this much? My grandparents who are just a few years from being demented do better than this

Grow a pair and talk to them. Be assertive instead of whining on 4chan about it, pussy

Anon I have tried, these fuckers will improve maybe for a week and then go back to their old disgusting ways. Our sister sometimes comes in and cleans the entire kitchen and a week later its all ruined again with clothes and bags scattered on the floor.

And if they dont improve at all they start trying to point out the wrong things that I apparently do or they shift blame unto someone else to avoid criticism. I hate this fucking house

People know the truth but it's too hard to accept so they dont think about it.
Whenever I start a discussion about behavioral data collection and how we're basically being held hostage by Big Tech, people just ignore it and go back to posting funny cat videos.
Every time I bring surveillance up on Discord, my friends just ignore it and continue posting cute animals like everything was fine.
What would happen if I created a new parallel Internet that didnt spy on its users?
We avoid the truth because frankly it doesn't impact us much practically. I mean, data collection or not, I will talk to people on Discord and have fun and enjoy my time there. We literally can't see the data collection happening so it doesn't affect us.
SHOULD we be concerned? Of course. But the convenience is worth it to most people.

They would just use it like the old Internet, albeit while feeling slightly more comfortable with the assured privacy.

For me it's not enough that I have fun, I want Big Tech to be pissed off
A noble cause, anon! Don't be like me, fight those horrible Big Tech bastards and their unethical data collection practices! Death to those disgusting firms! Death, I say!

Won't happen, they are at that stage of wealth and you making them irrelevant would be a sigh of relief as they could retire for the madness the big governments have placed on them. Notice that Bill Gates didn't start doing all his questionable shit until after he visited a certain island. You looking at Big Tech as the main problem is the midwit take they are hoping for because you get rid of the symptoms but not the disease.

What are you implying is the root cause?

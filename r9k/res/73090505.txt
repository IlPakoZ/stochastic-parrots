it's cause they're stupid and ugly and also fat lol. The sole men willing to date with them are black men, which are usually uneducated criminals with no job or degree or anyu

most white/asian women can just float through life, it takes real skill to fuck up as a white woman in western society
if you're a nigger woman and you are self-aware with no interest in nigger cutlure, you get ostracized by the other niggers almost immediately and suddenly you don't have a home anywhere but tumblr/r9k where you're seen as unique

They typically want white men who do not desire relationships with black women
Iris is a prime example of that situation

I looked through virginityexchange recently and it did indeed have a lot of lonely black women, mistly ones living in europe. I wish I had a qt black virgin gf.

1. many black girls only want to date black men and fight over a small number of said black men
2. black and introverted means you don't match to stereotypes and that makes people uncomfortable
3. limited looksmaxxing potential, being clean and thin is a baseline, but finding the right makeup and season colors are difficult for black women
3a. limited technology for changing skin color, hair texture and facial bone structure. This si a future possible market for biotech
4. limited dating opportunities in youth, tend to go crazy in college for tyrone
having self-awareness as a black person is very blackpilling, you have no history, our men are cucks,and the future is miserable

not true, most black women are exclusive towards black men, which is a major fight trigger 
you're stealing my man 
i have a (black) man and you don't
if most black women wanted to date white guys, they have plenty of chances in university but they don't. Mind you, most black femcels are educated but socially awkward

Film it next time, all men are porn addicts and with any luck your bf will be into it.

Why did you cheat on him?
Understanding the answer to that question is critical to becoming a better person. I'm assuming that is what you want, right?
<comment>
keep doing it and you'll feel less guilty.

Suicide probably, or maybe help him find a gf that isn't a whore.

Tell him and break up with him. Cheating on a partner is horrible and you should feel horrible

What if he didn't have to participate (or at least not with the other girl) and could just watch you dyking out with another chick? Like live-action porn.

Do absolutely anything and everything he wants, enthusiastically and without hesitation, for the rest of your life.

That doesn't answer the question at all. I know you feel bad about it. But why did you do it in the first place?
<comment>
Keep doing it for the rest of your life with every guy you end up with

Stop whore virtue signaling we know you don't feel any guilt kek
<comment>
as a guy whose been cheated on
Tell him and leave. It's the only conscionable thing you can do since you obviously just want to be with this other guy. As long as you stay with bf, you should feel guilty.

i could bring it up to him.
I have one FWB who I'm reasonably suspicious would have been a lesbian if she wasn't such a cock hungry cumslut, and she was super mad for a while that I didn't want to have threesomes with her, but eventually reached the compromise where she could bring a girl home and once she got frustrated with fucking the other girl I'd come in and fuck her so she could have a satisfying conclusion.
Had one girl swoop in to lick the come out of her, and after that I became receptive to watching and eventually to letting the other girl make out with her or something.
Kind of hilariously the event where it all came crashing down had her on top of me backwards cowgirl-style and the other girl pushed her onto her back and started eating her pussy while I fucked her, and then when the other girl saw I was starting to come stole the dick and swallowed everything.
Gave the FWB a lot of jealousy she wasn't expecting about some other girl getting the moneyshot and leaving her high&amp;dry and she stopped trying to get me into threesomes.
Which was actually kind of funny, since she'd still bring girls home when she was mad about it and drank too much, and then after being selfish in bed would tell them to leave and pass out.
And then these random girls would stand in the hallway outside the bedroom door, their clothes crumpled in a ball in their arms, and it was about 50:50 whether they'd turn towards the bathroom and get dressed and leave, or turn towards where I was chillin' on the couch watching TV and ask if I'd fuck them.
Fucking the FWB the next morning with some other girl's dried pussy juice secretly still on my dick was some of the best sex.

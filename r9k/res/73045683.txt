why is college so shit?
I swear all I see are fucking faggots and trannies whenever I go to college man, guys with dyed hair and girls with mullets, wtf happened bros
See, i'm in mathematics and my experience is the exact opposite. There are only autistic undersocialised borderline autistic 150+ iq savants here. 0 women. We never speak of anything other than mathematics, except when ine of the spergs starts sperging out about warhammer lore or crusader kings 2. It is so fucking kino. On the flipside it means that i haven't interacted with a female since high schooly which may sound fucking grim, but i love maths too much to care :)
So your 2 choices of the modern college experience are:
1) shithole non-college full of retards who don't care
2) ultra tryhard no girls allowed hellgrinder of pure studying
Thsi faggot took a real course of study; retards like me and OP just got hoodwinked. Still worth it to delay having to get an actual job for like 7 years, but college is a scam for at least 90 percent of its constituency. 
Absolutely, if you're not STEM material (I'm not), do not go to college unless someone is paying it, and paying YOU on top of it.

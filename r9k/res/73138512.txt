I work with a tall blond autistic girl and trust me dude she is really boring. Every time I ask her a question, work related or not, I regret it because it takes 15 minutes and I get no useful or interesting information. Even if it should be an interesting story or anecdote her delivery makes me wishing it would end.
And autism doesn't necessarily mean that you are smart either 
Shes not a bad person or anything but temper your expectations. Personality can make someone a completely non-sexual entity. There are reasons women don't want autists either.

Autistic slavic man here. You don't want anything to do with our women, believe me. They're not "crazy" in a fun way, they're dark triad Machiavellian backstabbing whores who would kill you for insurance money in a heartbeat with zero remorse. They're like chinks but White. Just get a nice American gril who isn't a social media addicted whore.

I will take her to a nice restaurant I guess, although I can also cook her good food.

most of them seem vapid or outright idiotic

No,xey don't lol
Cope shit colored hairlet
blonde women can only be improved by hair dye and tattoos
Idk, the shy black haired girls are usually chill and will be down to get pretty close to you but when they realize you actually really care about them and treat them right they'll get nervous and probably shy away from you.

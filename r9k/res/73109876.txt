I love to drink milk.
I have drank nothing but milk all week and im feeling powerful
I went through a milk phase. But I live a milk-free life now.
im sorry for you, truly
i love to drink my dads milk its so creamy
glowies are on my ass tonight, might have to drink the milk early tonight to relax
I drink like a 1000g of kefir daily now, I can't stop, it's like a substitute for afterwork alcohol.

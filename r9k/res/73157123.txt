How do you do it? Do you pray and read the Bible? This is so difficult for me I havent been able to hit a month for about 2-3 years now , only a few weeks or days. It feels like I need the help of god and Jesus in order to do those long streaks my mind is so filthy

How the fuck you do that? I haven't watched porn in a long time, porn is np, but no jacking off? How? my longest streak is 23 days, I currently masturbate twice a week, if I don't do it I would have some horny fucking nighmare and I would wake up with my boxers full of coom. So tell me how nigga!

I don't really pray or read the Bible. I will make the sign of the Cross though quite often, like some Crusader of old. I repeat it 3 times (Trinity). 
This often gives me a spiritual boost.

There is no easy way. You just have to be iron. Ironically I still watch porn. I've not stopped watching it these entire 4 months. 
I take the alcoholic in a bar approach. You have to be able to sit and stare at that glass of vodka all night without ever letting it touch your lips. 
Until you can, you are not iron. Until you can, you will succumb to temptation. 
Do not hide from temptation like a mouse, learn to embrace it and withstand it.

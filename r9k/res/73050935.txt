Relationships, online, behind closed doors, in my head. I seem to be against myself, and now I'm affecting my family. I'm young, and being 19 I know I can change, but I'm worried that I don't have a lot of control over what I'm doing. I'll get into the details if anyone gives a fuck (not aggressive on my part).

Most likely there is a reason as to why you're acting like this, be it a disorder, trust issues or trauma etc. You gotta find out what and go against it, see a therapist and see if they can help you establish some good strategies to fight your shitty involuntary behavior so you can get better.

I wouldn't really give it much thought if it didn't affect others so much. It's hard to even work now or do schoolwork, it's overwhelming.
I want it to stop, I'll find a therapist. Thanks.

Try some introspection and writing down your thoughts, you don't wanna go to a therapist and just say "I feel bad", try thinking about the cause but most importantly let the therapist help you and talk to them. Understand that it might take time and don't push them away, and remember that the first therapist you find might not suit or work for you, sometimes you gotta see a few to find one you work well with.

Why? Because you're actually not that bright? Or laziness?

my teachers told my parents i was a smart kid but they also asked them to get me diagnosed, my diagnosis for you anon is that you're a pussy bitch with too high expectations and you're putting the blame on everyone else

It happens, not the end of the world by any means. 
I'll give you a few tips.
1. Depending on how much time you have, you can always try to right the ship. Even if you don't have much time you'll still learn habits that will be good for later on. 
2. You can not include your GPA on your resumee, I know a guy who did that who makes $80k a year with a >3.0 GPA but he went to UCicago
3. (This one is a bit dangerous so be carful ) you can always just lie about your GPA, a lot of the time people won't check.

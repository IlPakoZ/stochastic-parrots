I hate when people here use words like roastie, moid, femoid, incel and so on to hurt each other for no reason (and sometimes even with reason).
We are already outcasts so is it too much to be nice to one another? Perhaps the reason you are an outcast is that you have become bitter from visiting this place and people can sense you are not good to be around.

Be ncie to each other. That's what anons should do.

Absolutely delighted to see someone talking like this on the front page. Been trying to say something along these lines for years. You'd think the loneliest people on the web would be more open to other weirdos.

Thank you for understanding anon! Means a lot.
<comment>
i feel the same, i try hard to be nice to even the meanest anons. you guy are like my family.
<comment>
be nice pls
why? youre some fag on the internet and i dont owe you a fucking thing. 
if i saw your real face, if i saw how fucking ugly you are, you would be less sympathetic just like me. 
this is how the real world works

It's only natural for the lifelong contempt and alienation some of us have experienced from the world around us would wind up into anger and hatred.

If we dropped the pepes and slurs, where would we even be?

I am too far gone. There's no point in pretending I'm not malicious at this point, it just cheapens the idea

Sperging out again vore?

I hate you just as much as you hate me. I would probably laugh at liveleak videos being made of you just like that Ukrainian soldier getting his balls cut off

Foids cannot be outcasts and "fembots" are just e-sluts looking for simps.

does vore even exist on this board anymore

you havent heard? 
oh man i hate to tell you this but she passed away weeks ago.. acid apparently.

I hate when people here use words like roastie
women cannot be robots, any roastie posting on r9k complaining about being lonely knows that at the end of the day all she has to do is stop ignoring one of the 3 fat manlets orbiting her rather than chasing chad and she will immediately stop being an "outcast" 
we used to be nice to each other here many years ago but then people like yourself that do not belong here started invading saying the same stupid shit like you said
le people sense your bitterness, everyone has telepathy and can understand your beliefs without having a single conversation with you
a 7 foot tall gigachad could be a serial rapist but you wouldn't care because to normalfags like yourself believe looks = personality
/r9k/ is bitter to you because it is obvious from your post that you are not a robot, you should go back to /soc/ or tiktok or whatever discord led you here

These words aren't hurtful. If you think they are, you don't belong here.

Incels are fucking retards and people who call women things like "roastie" absolutely should be cyberbullied
<comment>
I would have no problem with femcels or women in general if they weren't repulsed by me
<comment>

Words can kill, big guy
<comment>
No, it's social ostricisation that's harmful. The words themselves are harmless without that context.
<comment>
Gore vore?

No, it's social ostricisation that's harmful
Harmful is an understatement desu. It's actually the most disrespectful thing you can subject someone too; it's an insult not only to their person, but to their very being as a social species qua primate. It's really something you would only forgive people for if you completely lack self-respect. And like I said, monday. Fuck you
<comment>
I put up with this for months. Now I'm going to make it your problem
<comment>
I agree with you that words like femcel, incel, chad, Stacy etc is retarded. But begging everyone to be nice is also faggotry.

self defeating ideology 
To be an outcast, you have to have been cast out from something (almost always a community/le society).Think of it like a bunch of pieces that don't fit into the puzzle as opposed to one singular piece that doesn't fit in
We all didn't fit into these communities for different reasons and don't actually have to like each other.
We all don't fit but we are suited for different parts of the puzzle (some of are those weird pieces that are supposed to be in the corners, others are centerpieces and some are fucking defective and were cut wrong)
A mistake that a lot of anons make is calling the site a community of outcasts when in reality that is impossible because community and outcast are mutually exclusive.
the site is more like a senate of faggots where people who don't fit in come to have fun.
The only time when the site acts like a community is when there is an invasion or when we used to cyberbully newfags
If we were to be just one community, like the site is rapidly becoming, then 4chan would develop it's own normies and would eventually become just another group of normies 
point is, wholesomeposters have contributed to making the site more shit by making it easier to digest, more centralized and less open to different kinds of outcasts (which is what the glowies want and why they are almost always overly nice)

men receive trauma from experiences with females
females receive trauma from experiences with males
rather than relating to one another they delight in the suffering of eachother as perceived revenge for their own experience

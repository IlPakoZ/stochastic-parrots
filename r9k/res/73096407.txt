I'm in love with a skinny white girl with pretty face, nice personality and big boobs but she has a boyfriend
I once convinced a woman to break up with her a boyfriend of 2+ years (relationship was on its last legs anyway) to be with me. Then I told her to never bother contacting me again when she confessed to having genital herpes before our first date. Real shame too since she was the hottest woman that's ever been into me.
when she confessed to having genital herpes
Holyshit, glad she told you. Most don't and only after. Got lucky.
Indeed. I still feel bad about it though. Never found a woman with as nice of a figure or personality as her and she was really crazy about me, even when I was on my autistic behavior. Petite and fit body, but big ol' fat titties and a dump truck ass. Talked to me at a time in my life where I was extremely low confidence with women and ultimately pulled me out of the haze. Felt like God had just pulled the rug out from under me when the whole thing fell apart.

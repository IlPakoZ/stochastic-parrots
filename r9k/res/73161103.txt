How do I stop being so awkward?
How do I stop being so shy?
How do I stop being so weird?
By isolating yourself! Works for me
No idea
When I walk I feel like an alien, do not know how to position my hands, how to hold my shoulders etc etc
Cannot hold eye contact to save my life and get flustered when speaking to anyone or even stepping outside my house
Being in a room with even person makes me go mentally insane 
Get severe back pain and face gets oily and hot
ennis is that you?
i simply completely isolated myself from everyone and spent my time watching old slasher movies for a month
it may have fucked with my perception of humans but it did work
get buff, big confidence boost
when you're confident its not weird and awkward its quirky and empathetic

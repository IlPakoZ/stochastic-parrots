too neurotic to mutually enjoy being with a sub girl 
too proud to mutually enjoy being with a dom girl 
Who here in limbo hell when it comes to relationships? I feel like I'm always a decent option, but never the best choice for so many girls
Switch girl, if such exist, seems like a solution, but girls are either too selfish to top or too insecure to bottom, so idk if that's a real thing
You're not wrong and I've definitely had the best synergy with switches the more girls I meet. I guess I was hoping for an easier more 'natural' synergy since switch relationships are inherently changing and less static than the other types. I guess I just have to be ok with uncertainty, that's life after all

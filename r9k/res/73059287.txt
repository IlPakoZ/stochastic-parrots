What is your happiest childhood memory?
eating square cut pb&amp;j sandwiches under the canopy with my grandma
The moment I had sex with your mom ;3
Sweaty palms completing elite 4 in pokemon yellow
my happiest childhood memory was when i switched to another school, because i was being bullied
i got bullied in the other school too
Holding my little sister and little brother after our parents got divorced. Only time in my life I ever felt like I was worth anything.
Being tucked in in a hospital bed being read Dragonheart by my mom. I don't know why for sure, but hospitals are oddly comforting to me. I suspect it has to do with how often I was in them as a little kid.
When grandpa gifted me my first bicycle. That thing was awesome. I loved riding that thing.

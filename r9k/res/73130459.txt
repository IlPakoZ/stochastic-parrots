i always coped with being single because i'm apparently physically attractive (multiple strangers have told me this), but maybe i truly am repulsive to women and will never slay like chad. shit sucks.
Hey, look at the bright side, you have someone to date!
did you read the whole thing? or am i missing a bit here
she would've probably been ok just hooking up with you OP. sounds like to me, she just doesn't want anything serious. but it doesn't sound like she outright rejected you. 
instead, tell her you understand, and that you'd still like to go out. work on getting her back to your place after the second date.
i think she's unironically catholic though, so i'm not sure if the hookup theory is right
Holy shit you got played for an absolute fucking fool LMAO!
probably true, i should rope now right
and?
I did, and i stand corrected, he has someone to date(for a while), have fun ig idk
yeah i don't think she wants to date/fuck. she's probably just trying to be nice by being my 
"friend" but didn't want to reject me outright
then fuck her. Invest your time in something worthwhile, like maybe bettering your self or going on a vacation, let yourself loose for a bit from the environment around you, it can be life changing, trust me on this one brother
okay sure, thanks anon, i appreciate it

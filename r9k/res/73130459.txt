start feeling more confidence in myself and my appearance lately
sick of letting life pass me by
determined to ask out the next girl i'm interested in
meet a girl at a research conference
she acts really friendly and gives me a lot of interest
asks to sit next to me
i ask for her number at the end and if she'd want to get coffee sometime, she says yes
text her later, she tells me she's not looking for a relationship since she's on a "dating fast" and she'll be going back to her home country for the summer
i always coped with being single because i'm apparently physically attractive (multiple strangers have told me this), but maybe i truly am repulsive to women and will never slay like chad. shit sucks.
Hey, look at the bright side, you have someone to date!
did you read the whole thing? or am i missing a bit here
she would've probably been ok just hooking up with you OP. sounds like to me, she just doesn't want anything serious. but it doesn't sound like she outright rejected you. 
instead, tell her you understand, and that you'd still like to go out. work on getting her back to your place after the second date.
i think she's unironically catholic though, so i'm not sure if the hookup theory is right
Dating fast
Holy shit you got played for an absolute fucking fool LMAO!
probably true, i should rope now right
catholic
and?
I did, and i stand corrected, he has someone to date(for a while), have fun ig idk
yeah i don't think she wants to date/fuck. she's probably just trying to be nice by being my 
"friend" but didn't want to reject me outright
then fuck her. Invest your time in something worthwhile, like maybe bettering your self or going on a vacation, let yourself loose for a bit from the environment around you, it can be life changing, trust me on this one brother
okay sure, thanks anon, i appreciate it

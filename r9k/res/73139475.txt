You're supposed to hold the knife upright on the edge, then with your other hand you need to hit the hilt like it's a hammer. Knife will puncture the aluminum lid, do that going around and when it's halfway you can pry the lid open with your hands. That's how I do it. Won't be hurting yourself lmao.

Be me, trying to open a can of beans with a pocket knife like a dumbass
Can opener is nowhere to be found, so I figure the knife will do
Hold the can in one hand and the knife in the other, trying to pry open the lid
Knife slips and I accidentally stab myself in the leg
Scream in pain and drop the knife and can
Roommate comes in and sees me bleeding all over the kitchen floor, knife in leg
Calls an ambulance and we rush to the hospital
Get to the ER and they take me in for emergency surgery
Doctors tell me I was lucky to not hit an artery or do more damage
End up with several stitches and a large bandage on my leg
Roommate fucks with me about my can-opening skills for weeks afterwards

You're supposed to hold the knife upright on the edge, then with your other hand you need to hit the hilt like it's a hammer. Knife will puncture the aluminum lid, do that going around and when it's halfway you can pry the lid open with your hands. That's how I do it. Won't be hurting yourself lmao.

Does it say on the can not to open with a knife? Or on the knife not to use to open cans? Sue!

Use a screwdriver when you need to open a can without a can opener. Using a knife will fuck the blade

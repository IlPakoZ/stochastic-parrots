How did (YOU)!! solve this conundrum, japanese learning robots?
I read all H scenes. If you skip you're gay.
but that's like watching porn and not skipping a single second!
Wanikani is hella expensive
9 dollars per month
I needed to learn porn vocab anyway- that's how I thought of it.
After I read a few nukige I started reading good shit like saya no uta, drakoi, kara no shoujo, yume miru kusuri, carnival, saihate no ima. I didn't feel the need to skip because there were fewer sex scenes, and most are well written, or at least infrequent enough to keep my attention.
and is hella useless too

There was an attempt.

I wonder at which point the threshold is met of the drawing being good or accurate enough to be considered a brony image.

I tried embarrassingly hard at this, but instead of a horse it seems I've drawn a psychopathic horned anteater with misshapen penises for legs furiously pissing itself.

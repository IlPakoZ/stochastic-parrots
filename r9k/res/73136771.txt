Reminder that women find neuroticism extremely unattractive, which is why you will almost always get btfo for opening up to a girl

Be the opposite of women if you want women, fuckwits.

This is the truth, I have had many opportunities with women but as soon as we get close and I open up a little they suddenly become distant and I never knew why. In hindsight its because women like a veneer of shy and cuteness but when you expose your rotten neurotic core they are repulsed.

This anon gets it, I've had very similar experiences. I was confused and angry at first, but the more it happened the more I zeroed in on the truth. They will never admit why they do it, but being suddenly distant after you open up is so on the money, it's like fucking clockwork

"women hate neuroticism"
makes a neurotic post

implying my goal was to make women like me 
I simply want to help other anons. Most anons live under the delusion that their looks are the main problem, or that they will be able to successfully open up to a girl. Neuroticism in on par with autism in terms of non-physical traits which women are repulsed by. The first step of bettering yourself is understanding what's wrong in the first place

Neuroticism=below 6 feet.

No anon, neuroticism = under 5'8, autism = under 5'7. It's ogre for neuroticels

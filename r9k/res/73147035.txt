Anyone else feel like the dating game is rigged? 
This is why I gave up.
If you remove sex from a relationship the man leaves
if you remove money from the relationship the women leaves.
Not to mention women are under such little environmental pressure to introspect or have insightful perspectives that they are extremely boring to talk to. I enjoy talking to men vastly more than women, but I'm not sexually attracted to men. Talking to women feels like pulling teeth, not because they don't enjoy it, but because they are so fucking boring to talk to, they have nothing interesting, insightful, or even funny to say. I would literally rather just think to myself alone than talk to a woman
no one's forcing you to play it
No shit, it's not that simple though, men have a deep need for sex and physical affection. Women have degraded so much though that this is literally all they offer now. The juice doesn't seem like it's worth the squeeze, so I'm left with this primal desire unfulfilled

That's why I specifically said it was more than sex. Maybe physical affection was the wrong way to phrase it, but mutual love and romance is deep, deep desire for most guys. I just really struggle to talk to women since I find it extremely boring. I would unironically rather watch paint dry and think to myself. Maybe I am too entitled to not being mentally bored
we've had this discussion a 1000 times already. the state provides women with what they used to need men for. meaning women can be incredibly picky and demanding because they don't need you- you'll pay for their stuff in taxes anyway
everything in life is rigged, you're stupid if you don't see it
If a game is rigged then do not play.

Modern society is good as a filtration system to separate the strong and the cunning from the weak.
Don't be ashamed of being an incel or a virgin, be glad that you don't get to participate in their sterile bread and circus.

Don't be ashamed of being an incel or a virgin, be glad that you don't get to participate in their sterile bread and circus.
But aren't virgins and incels the filtered ones? Aren't we supposed to feel shame for being weak.

Yes incels are the strong though. Fruitless permiscious sex is part of the circus which only weakens an person and destroys their spiritual innocence.

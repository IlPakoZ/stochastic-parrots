Why does google reverse image search fucking suck so much now? It automatically forces you to use google lens which never identifies the image, and when you try to find the source it usually turns up nothing even if you've found your image on google images. 
Yandex is so much better than this shit
Because they're trying to make money
they don't care about NEETs looking up porn, it's for soccer moms to find where to buy an outfit in a picture
even google non-reverse image search sucks now because they keep dumbing it down so I mainly use yandex for everything reverse or not
the only thing is that while yandex image searching is better it will still be retarded and post tons of duplicate results

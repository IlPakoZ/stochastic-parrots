boss praises me
I get nervous and giggly
recently start thinking of him as a father figure
I am male and straight btw so what causes this?

Isn't it obvious? What was your father like growing up?

Idk we got on fine but I always thought he was weak

There you have it. You want a strong figure to look up to. A male father figure where it actually means something if he's proud of you

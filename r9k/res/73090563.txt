This is a feel

I spent $200 on a drawing tablet and used it for less then a week. Why can't I just be good at everything I try.

i lov drawing was bad at it for a long time had to practice a stupid amount but now im kinda goated. just look at more art ie animated stuff and comics so you can have an artist you want to be like
<comment>
i also bought one and didnt use it for like a year or two and now a few years later i use it constantly

there's a mystery to it and a realization of a lifetime but also not just about yourself but life about how the game gets rigged since power is so deep

this is me but with music. I buy all kinds of stupid audio shit, thinking ok this time I'll put in the effort. I never do.

Very real know that feel drawfagging for 10+ years.
Drawing is one of the hardest things to actually get good at.

I fucking wish. Plus everything turns out to be a letdown once you get into it.
Drawing ended up as just being memorizing what people had already mastered hundreds of years ago, and once you memorized enough to put whatever is in your mind on the page it simply stops being fun.
(insert instrument here) turned out to be just memorizing scales and basic math, mostly the math. Miss me with that desu. At least it still feels cool to play fast stuff, but I'd rather play a rhythm game at that point.
Art is overhyped anyway. Nothing you make will ever please you, and you will always look back on work you did just yesterday as shit, because you didn't devote 10,000 hours to making it perfect.

this is stupid yes art is grindy and hard, and yes like everything else, we've been doing it for a long ass time. developing a skill is rewarding in itself and you can draw cool stuff you like. like every other skill, if you dont practice and grind you will not be good, and the people who do will surpass you

the problem is you have to have enough time to practice it and in time you will start to enjoy it,
if you are a wageslave or just expect to jump into a hobby overnight, you will just be disappointed
and especially for drawing, most artists started doodling in elementary school, continued through high school
and probably enrolled in some art college, so you are already 10 years behind, give yourself some time to learn to enjoy it

why do people talk about guns but never cigarettes or fentanyl?
and why does government want to take your guns away while arming themselves to the teeth?
it's literally as simple as tv man says guns are bad, and people are against fentanyl they just know that banning it wont do anything (if it isn't already banned lol)
any government that cared would give the fentanyl addicts a safe source of drugs like canada does

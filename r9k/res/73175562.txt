You DO smoke right?
fuck off shill weed smoking is cool but cigarettes are such a waste of time and deteriorate your health quicker than most anything else
It's not cool, it's fucking gay. You are sticking a phallic object in your mouth at sucking on it. Smoking is only acceptable if you're depressed or doing it to escape at a party or something.
Oh yes, big boy. All smokers are autistic and have oral fixations
I start smoking since I broke up and I feel like shit, it was cool in the beginning and make me feel more relaxed but in no time make me feel like a forced fap and now I can't stop feeling anxious
Yeah no. If this was real I'd be smoking packs every day, but it takes decades for them to do anything
kek
Weed is among the few things making normie society tolerable
Nobody who doesn't smoke weed thinks that way.
Op here, forgot to mention weed is for faggots.
Its only "cool" because of decades of marketing by big tobacco.
no u fag
Weed and cigarettes are for faggots
I had smoked for nearly around 15 years and I have quit since last March. My lungs hurt when I wake up soon after quitting, I'm actually scared of starting again usually I just get tempted back to it.
Hence, I have not had any cravings, I quit with an elf bar or similar styles of disposable vape.
Smoking is gay. They're called fags for a reason.
During the time I was incarcerated in Los Angeles it was common slang to meaning beating someone up when saying "smoking." Like "Ah, I smoked that fool."
Also, whoever came up with the idea that smoking is some kind of symbol of manhood is a gay retard. No better than redditors acting like they're manly because they eat le epic bacon.
Smoking is retarded but I really like the smell of a pipe. A shame not a lot of people smoke those these days

fuck off shill weed smoking is cool but cigarettes are such a waste of time and deteriorate your health quicker than most anything else

It's not cool, it's fucking gay. You are sticking a phallic object in your mouth at sucking on it. Smoking is only acceptable if you're depressed or doing it to escape at a party or something.

I start smoking since I broke up and I feel like shit, it was cool in the beginning and make me feel more relaxed but in no time make me feel like a forced fap and now I can't stop feeling anxious

Yeah no. If this was real I'd be smoking packs every day, but it takes decades for them to do anything

I had smoked for nearly around 15 years and I have quit since last March. My lungs hurt when I wake up soon after quitting, I'm actually scared of starting again usually I just get tempted back to it.
Hence, I have not had any cravings, I quit with an elf bar or similar styles of disposable vape.

in most country's tobacco companies cannot make marketing campaigns and if they can is self sabotaging 
Still one of the most profitable products

Smoking is gay. They're called fags for a reason.

During the time I was incarcerated in Los Angeles it was common slang to meaning beating someone up when saying "smoking." Like "Ah, I smoked that fool."

Also, whoever came up with the idea that smoking is some kind of symbol of manhood is a gay retard. No better than redditors acting like they're manly because they eat le epic bacon.

Smoking is retarded but I really like the smell of a pipe. A shame not a lot of people smoke those these days

I had the perfect life and I feel terrible. I have been an awful child. I am 19, and I ready to give my soul to God.

Christfaggotry is a cope for people who can't handle reality and need an outlet to deal with the guilt of merely existing kek

fair enough. But how else do I cope. My mother has been real controlling of me and emotionally dependent on me. And for the last 5 years my step father has had to depend on me for emotional support due to my mum being selfish/having her own issues. It's really too much sometimes. What other cope can I do?

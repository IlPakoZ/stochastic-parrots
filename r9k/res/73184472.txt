Christfaggotry is a cope for people who can't handle reality and need an outlet to deal with the guilt of merely existing kek
I apologise, but isn't Christianity enticing?
as is every cope in society, but its still a cope
theres lots of other schools of thoughts out there far more enlightenning, and rewarding
but yea id considered becoming christian in name only at one point just bc i wanted to fuck someone who was a jesus freak. I hope he knew i only wanted to go to church with him to fuck him
fair enough. But how else do I cope. My mother has been real controlling of me and emotionally dependent on me. And for the last 5 years my step father has had to depend on me for emotional support due to my mum being selfish/having her own issues. It's really too much sometimes. What other cope can I do?
what other schools?
Based churchgoer crush.

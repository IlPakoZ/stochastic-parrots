Withered flowers forget
What they wept for
Day after day-ay-ay-ay
Withered flowers must blossom
In the stream of tears
Theystillthink of thecause
Turning misery into meaningfulness
Changing day afterday-ay-ay-ay
Turning misery into meaningfulness
Changing day after day-ay-ay-ay

Your affection, your affection, your affection
Past will tell you when to make yourself a hero

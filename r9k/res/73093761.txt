I don't care about women, I don't care about not having a gf, I don't care! I'm living life on a routine, wake up, work, gym, sleep. I actually enjoy this feeling, I hated being sad about no gf, feeling alone. I don't care anymore it's like a blessing.
honestly this is how im trying to get to, just a life that will satisfy my every day. though, i wish i could at least experience reciprocated love one day, and then i'll decide
if you have to make this thread, it might still subconsciously be on your mind. either way it is a super normal thing to want a gf, so dont beat yourself up if you have moments throughout a day about it. but im glad you have other stuff you can enjoy anon
I do agree with you. Posting here is just affirming my feelings. Something like: "it's ok to feel this way", "you are doing fine" etc.
Sometimes I feel like this is not living life. I see others partying, having sex, "enjoying life", and it makes me feel like I'm missing out. I believe I developed this feeling as a coping mechanism.
I've never talked to anyone about this, telling strangers is somehow therapeutic. Thank you for your replies.
Women dont matter! the gym doesnt matter! All that matter is doing prison workouts and eating beef
I believe that eventually your brain develops a numbing feeling to the pain if you embrace the truth, there's a chance you may simply be alone or not. It is uncertain. I feel like coping by ignoring the improbability or purposely making yourself feel sad keeps your brain from accepting, it is liberating.
Love is overrated. It's like a high that lasts a few years and by the time you so er up you're already fucked and financially shackled to her an a kid.
good for you for getting to that state of mind considering your brain is hard wired into putting you into distress over nopussy

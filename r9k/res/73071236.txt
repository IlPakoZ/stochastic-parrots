How wrong is it to fuck your second cousin?
only if she's not a baddie
it's not wrong to fuck any of your family members anon.
My grandpas brother married his third cousin in 1942
If you've already fucked one cousin, I don't see how doing it with a second one would be much worse
The genetically ideal reproductive match between two people in terms of closeness of relation is third cousin, I believe. Balancing three factors:
-the dysgenic effect of genes not matching during outbreeding
-the eugenic effect of synchronicity between common genes
-the dysgenic effect of recessive maladaptive genes expressing during inbreeding
Something like that, I forget exactly. Basically fuck someone who looks like you but isn't your literal sister or first cousin
No, I mean the grandchild of your grandparents sibling.
First cousin or farther is okay and erotic
Have you killed or forced to do horrible things to anybody? Have you robbed, break or vandalize someone's property? 
If the answer is no to both of the previous questions, then just live your life. Who cares. Anything else is moralfaggotry set to pacify niggers who get triggered at the world not being the perfect equation they fantasize about.
Also something about immune systems...? There's a paper or three about this that I'm not remembering

how did you think love worked?
It goes like this:
He loves her, but she doesn't love him. He is sad.
She loves him, but he doesn't love her. He probably will fuck her anyway.
They both love each other. They are happy.
I imagine it feels like how I feel when I'm rolling on MDMA, except it's not as good and much more complicated.
All I knew is that it was supposed to happen.
well for one thing i thought it was for everyone.
everyone dated with intention of marriage

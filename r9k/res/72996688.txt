Ever gotten lucky at an anime convention?
I've never gotten lucky anywhere, OP
Wtf??? 4chan told me that Chud is an incel!
I've ever only gone to anime convenctions with my gf. So guess that depends on your definition of lucky.
no because i don't go to cons. however, i have a friend, who SLAYS at cons. and the only thing he does, is dress like a attractive male character from a popular franchise. he's not even a chad, he's pretty average.
what does slaying at a con even entail. like getting lots of female attention in general? or like actual numbers and stuff
Normies weren't kidding when they said to just be confident
Yeah but I'm socially inept so every con is just me taking a look at all the booths and activities and then leaving. No one wants to talk to me so I won't bother them.
Based baldcel.
same. I am not physically shut-in.
just that I'm a ghost in public.
normies will never understand.
I always get lucky because my objective is other.
I take great pleasure in lifting breaking the backs of the fags with the free hugs sign.
Goddamnit I never liked those cause I thought seeking groups was dumb. I am alone now cause of edgyness.
Going out giving people bear hugs is pretty wholesome if I may say so

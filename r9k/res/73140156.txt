A woman I've barely spoken to is coming over to my apartment to watch movies. How do I avoid fucking this up?

Mother would be sad if I did that.
Yeah I'll try not to sperg too hard. I have no idea why she even agreed to come. She also doesn't know that the only TV in my apartment is in front of my bed. Think I'll chat her up on the couch and then see if she's comfortable lying next to me.

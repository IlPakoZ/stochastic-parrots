I'm like 90% I must have some form of mental illness
But because I've never been to a brain doctor and I just act normal with people
I can have cool shit like guns and licenses
I imagine browsing here since middle school probably wasn't the best of ideas on top of alot of other things
I blame being born like 4 months premature for a good amount of it, but definitely not all of it

Also on top of all that
When my parents were fighting immensely and separated for a period of time
This board was the only support I had
Hell, even today it's the only community I even interact with
As vastly different as it is
This place and /k/ were the closest things I had to role models growing up
For better or worse
Prolly worse
But somewhat better
In a very specific way

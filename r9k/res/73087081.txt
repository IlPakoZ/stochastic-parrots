I wish someone liked me. No one likes me. It hurts my feelings
<comment>
Why should somebody like you.
Are you likeable?
<comment>
i think it's neat that you still have a copy of your old games, anon.
<comment>
Do you like you, anon?
<comment>
I look like him
I still have all my n64 and GameCube games
No
<comment>
Do you like anyone? Sometimes that helps by itself. I met someone here on discord and he has been such a comfort I wish he didn't live so far away.
<comment>
No, she doesnt like me anymore
<comment>
And no one will care.
Not even your family. If you're male and you try to be honest about your struggles they will slowly start to hate you and think that somethings wrong with you.
So tell me, does your family like you? What's your relationship with your parents like?

Is that why you're feeling so down?
<comment>
Probably. I havent felt good in a very long time.

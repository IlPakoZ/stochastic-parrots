I almost broke down crying in the drive thru buying a snow cone. I haven't left my house in days and I'm feeling especially suicidal so I thought a sugar free (I'm trying to stay slim) snow cone would cheer me up. But hearing my voice crack from lack of use (I've barely spoken a word all week) just broke me. Luckily I held it together and only started crying as I drove away.

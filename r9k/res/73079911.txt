How fucked up is ur life
Can't complain.
All those things except I wouldn't say I'm not hardworking or that I'm poor. Not sure if I'm mentally ill honestly. Despite that, however, I'm fucked all the same so God help whoever is all those things.
Things could be worse I suppose.
im none of those things but i have a huge cock
I'm all of those, except being medicated. But my family has a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, diabetes and schizophrenia in basically everyone on my mother's side. I'm only 28 but I'm starting to feel the early stages of osteoarthritis so its not long before the other fucked up genetics start kicking in and I start getting medicated in my 30s
i hate waking up

Hows everybody doing??
I feel free and happy, I won't have to endure this pain forever. I've got 10 years to live left.
Thats wonderul, feel happy as long as you can even If it is a very short time. I'd rather be happy and free for 10 years than full emptiness for enternity. It feels like the same cycle for me, nothing interesing. May i ask why are you living only 10 years and no more? Any illnes orrr
I feel empty atm but its oke
Sick and miserable since 2 years. It's a challenge not to become bitter. I had problems with depression since my teenage, but now I know that physical pain is even more prone to pull a soul to the dark side of anger and hate. It's an endless struggle, and no rest. Often I could just scream. When I tried to kill myself as a teen, my body was healthy ... now I don't want to die, but I hate it so much to live with this sick body ...
just found a shit ton of weed i forgot i had bought. i'm about to have an absolutely degenerate day, yotsuber

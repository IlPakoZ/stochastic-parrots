Why didn't you just put in the work in high school? You didn't think to self-improve then?

I joined the football team but I never got laid.

How is that fair? How was he ever going to fail?

He wasn't "chad" his whole life, he became "chad" through hard work and dedication. He probably spent his entire life playing football. That is why he is in the position he is and you aren't. The ONLY thing he didn't do for himself was be 6'4 but he also probably ate really well which contributed to his growth so even that isn't really a big deal. If you ate chicken and broccoli when you were 7 instead of hot pockets and ice cream you would have achieved this mythical "chad" status you incels seem to keep crying about.

this just really isn't true, and I'm not going to bother even typing out why, as you already know why.
kill yourself.

I put all my points into intelligence and agility in high school. I didn't have any left for strength, so now I post here.
<comment>
I was 5'4 when I started hs, I was 5'4 in my last year of hs. 
When you think things will get better, they just keep getting worst.

Linebacker btw
You were big as fuck, you didn't go to parties?
<comment>
No. Nobody invited me to a party. 
I wish you guys played sports when you were younger, it doesn't make you magically popular. You're still a weirdo, you're just the weirdo on the football team. The other players don't really invite you out.

Im autistic and even reach 5'6 tall until I was 18 so hs me at peak performance wouldn't have been anywhere near this no matter how much I tried. I gave up on mixing with my peers pretty early, I did okay for a literal retard though I was pretty well liked in a harmless retard kid sort of way.
<comment>
sorry for being held accountable for what parents fed me with when i wasnt old enough to financially dictate my own diet i guess
<comment>
I managed to get into the best school my country has in my field and I'm already (21) miles ahead of everyone else I know careerwise because of it. I can't fathom being a loser who didn't get anything done, you should just give up
<comment>
am 6'4 but weigh over 70lbs less
<comment>
Yeah, I was. and that was to improve to graduate with a degree in my hand. Everything else is fuck all and most likely wont last after high school, especially when people saw you as a retarded fuck.
<comment>
He got into football in the first place because he was always big and strong compared to other kids
<comment>
I genuinely keked

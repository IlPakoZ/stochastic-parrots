be me
lonesome friendless faggot in his late 20s, shitty job, living with parents, a loser
finally get a friend after years
he's my workmate, he's so funny, always making the coolest jokes, loves vidya, reads manga, we shaare stuff, can trust him and he always has my back if any problem ever happens at work
oh and he has a gf
for weeks i've been constantly jerking off to the thought of making his gf gag on my cock balls deep while he's looking
why does it feel like i'm going to ruin everything?
i deserve painful loneliness for the rest of my coomer life till i rot
Just ask if they're poly or have an open relationship.
ok dude calm down. i know it fucked uo but just because you thought about it doesnt mean you want to do it
you would never cuck your friend because thats bad and you wouldnt do bad things to your homie.his gf is an human being who isnt interested into you. shes happy with him. dont let intruse thoughts fuck you up. you deserves happinness too
also start talking to women to get a gf
i deserve painful loneliness for the rest of my coomer life till i rot
Yep
Just ask if they're poly or have an open relationship.
Definitely don't do that. Extremely small chance it works, much higher chance he never talks to you again (what I'd do if some faggot asked me this).

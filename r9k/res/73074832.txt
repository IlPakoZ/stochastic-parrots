I still don't understand why men have to act so cold towards you just because things didn't work out.
I mean, I get being rejected, since that's hurtful to anyone, and no amount of justification is ever going to change that. We reject people mostly because we have to, not because we want to. And I get that being rejected in favour of somebody is an even worse hell (and not anything I'd wish upon another). But again, we do these things out of necessity.
Still, some of men's responses to these instances are *not* what I'd categorise as necessary. Responses such as acting like you don't exist (or even in the same room as each other). Or claiming you were never really friends to begin with (and downplaying the times you've met). Or things like when you're talking in a group setting, and he completely ignores you and/or walks away like you're a silent and invisible.
Shit like that, neither of which is reasonable, nor fair to anybody (not even themselves).
and the most painful part of this is that he has no problem being friends with women (and has plenty of them). but now you're the leper he wishes to dissociate from

Another thread about this? How are you not banned yet? Even so, you dont HAVE to. You CHOOSE to. So the guy gets to choose to not acknowledge your existence and isolate you. You get what you deserve, cunt.

men have trouble being friends with women outside of being partners. acting nice to men will probably be taken as a sign of being interested in them. so naturally, someone who seems to be interested in you rejecting you sucks, and thus we have no reason to continue being interested in women who reject us (because there's little to no hope of being friends, men and women rarely ever share similar viewpoints and hobbies).
and the most painful part of this is that he has no problem being friends with women (and has plenty of them). but now you're the leper he wishes to dissociate from
because he has a chance with these women, or they are gfs of his male friends and he has no ill will against them. women who reject you are obviously single and wouldn't have any reason to be in a circle other than being 'friends' with someone there, so since they are neither a gf of his male friend, nor are they available, they have no use for it

Responses such as acting like you don't exist (or even in the same room as each other)
you're not morally entitled to having your existence acknowledged you entitled cunt
Or claiming you were never really friends to begin with (and downplaying the times you've met)
you're not morally entitled to people genuinely enjoying the time they spent with you, you worhtless entitled snob
Or things like when you're talking in a group setting, and he completely ignores you and/or walks away like you're a silent and invisible
you're not morally entitled to attention, how fucking entitled can you get
theres so good reason why someone is morally entitled to give you those things. theres no good reason why they OUGHT or SHOULD do those things
you are just a entitled foid who wants the whole world to worship her because she has a vagina
nor fair to anybody
cope harder, it is fair, because you are not entitled to their friendshits
holy SHIT you are fucking repulsive by the sheer entitlement of your post. dear LORD how entitled can one person be?
your simps that you string alone, KNOWINGLY string along, never liked you for your personality. they wanted sex with you. and after you rejected them, they left
its actually unreal how entitled you are
<comment>
rejected, hurt, embarrased, insulted, confused, ashamed, frustrated and depressed.
possibly even publicly. 
expected to show up the next day and continue like nothing happened.
It is easier and safer for many reasons to pretend the person who rejected you no longer exists and is often how that person would prefer to view you as well.

I still don't understand why men have to act so cold towards you just because things didn't work out.
Because you, cunts, usually then just remain "friends". And when you get a chad that fucks you regularly, then this poor dude is expected "to be friends" with chad too. And remember that you are being fucked, while he can only watch from the distance.
What a sick dumb whore you are.

We reject people mostly because we have to, not because we want to.
What?
<comment>
When you're not a fucking asshole it feels bad to turn down someone that has genuine feelings for you. You don't want to
But you don't want to lead them on and be on a loveless relationship in which you have to pretend you like them back either. So you have to turn them down
Does this make it easier for your sperg brain to understand?

Because it's necessary to get over rejection, it's that simple
<comment>
It's disheartening to anyone that you're just simply not genetically good enough for a girl to want to be with you, and no amount of personality will ever change that.
<comment>
This is the dumbest fucking thing I have ever read in my entire life. You reject someone out of desire, or lack thereof, not necessity.
<comment>
"Having to" implies duty, not necessity.
The fact that you reject someone because you don't desire them back doesn't mean it's pleasant to reject them. It's something one doesn't usually want to do, specially if they knew each other beforehand and afterwards friendship won't be an option for the party that is in love 
Anon, go outside, experience things, fall in love and out of it instead of yelling at me

You can get rejected because of your personality. An insecure 9/10 has less chances of getting a girlfriend than a secure and charismatic 4/10.
The problem with incels is that they think it all stems from their bad looks, so they never do bother to improve their conversation skills.

Necessity is the word that you used.
<comment>

I do not care to address edge cases. Most of the time, if you're friends with a girl and even get rather close she will NEVER see you as something more than that. If you're attractive, she can probably have a turn-over.
An insecure 9/10 has less chances of getting a girlfriend than a secure and charismatic 4/10.
This is unbelievably retarded and detracts from your point.

This makes sense.

I wouldn't remain friends with someone who rejected me. It hurts too much. 
Just move on and ignore her presence. 
You rejected him, whether you wanted to or not, these are the consequences. Just move on.
<comment>

This is going to become a "your word against mine" so it's probably not worth to pursue further. We are differently sexed so we have lived different kinds of rejection
However, I'll say that there's an entire culture built around marketing products to improve women's image. Makeup, clothes, depilation, manicure. Things to appeal to men. A woman doesn't need a good personality or intelligence to be desired
However, you see no such things with men, except maybe that they have to be fit. What they do need to be appealing is a good personality, they have to be funny, and generally bring a sense of stability 
This is unbelievably retarded and detracts from your point.
It doesn't? Charisma and confidence are key parts of a good personality, it's an example to my main point

So because one man was a dick to you that means we all are?
I fucking hate people (yes, men and women) who think they're a fucking expert on the opposite sex because of their own subjective experience.
I get ghosted or rejected? Idgaf, I move on and find someone who is interested. Forget anyone that isn't interested, they're nothing and not worth getting worked up over. I just say no worries, thanks for the honesty and go.
<comment>
Things to appeal to men
No these things appeal to women. Otherwise they wouldn't be buying them. When people say "society expects women to look like [...]" they really mean other women. No man would comment on a woman's appearance, manicure, etc. Perhaps this ought to tell you that men don't really care about it, and that the "culture" built for marketing to women is just profit off women's insecurities while using "this is what men want" as a scapegoat spoiler: women want it, not men 
You are also br*tish and in my opinion, most of the time girls there seemingly have personalities and interests. In the US, women speak like braindead pothead spics and the ones that don't, don't do anything all day other than scroll on their phones. They do not ask reciprocal questions about you, they have no interest besides social media. They literally do not have the attention span for relationships. One thing they do like is sexual attention from attractive men, and that's it. 
Charisma and confidence are key parts of a good personality, it's an example to my main point
Sure it's an example to your main point, if it was true. "Retarded" is a misnomer, I meant "desusional". It's just nowhere near grounded in reality to how the relationship dynamics work. Someone attractive is perceived as charismatic, while someone unattractive is perceived as uncharismatic. Someone unattractive being confident is considered "creepy". What you're saying is idealistic -- if a guy just has a nice personality he'll have a long term relationship with a girl that loves him. And that's just not how it works at all.

Yes, I'm diagnosing you right now

men have limited ability for emotional investment. turns out when you rob a well dry, you have to wait a while for it to fill with water again. point being men will pick and choose where to dump their emotional energy, he has a limited amount and will usually choose not to waste it on a woman who rejected him. instead he will use the little energy he's got to pursue another woman or focus on better ways to be alone for a while, so he can gain his emotional energy back. 
it's tough for guys because no one cares about them, so it's hard to be emotionally invested in anyone let alone someone who rejects you outright. also, men get rejected all the time and understand how it plays out if they keep talking to the same girl who rejected them, it goes nowhere. either as a relationship prospect or a friendship, and most guys in friendships with women just get used up emotionally like they're in a relationship but with none of the downsides and all the upsides. even worse, in friendship women offer even less than they would in a relationship. you won't be able to call her if you're feeling down or need someone you can trust with private information, because she'll tell everyone and won't give a shit about dealing with your problems. but you always have to lend a ear to her's, plus she already has a boyfriend and multiple friends she likes way more than you. so for the guy, he sees there's no point in a one-sided friendship/acquaintanceship, and cuts his losses.

Those are more extreme copes and generally not how most people break up.

You aren't owed recognition.
All an ex has to do is not be offensive to you. Basic decency and nothing more.
<comment>
No these things appeal to women
You're right to an extent. But when a woman is very hairy she must shave to even begin to be appealing to the opposite sex
But yes, unless a she's very ugly, her makeup only concerns other women.
You are also br*tish
WHERE did you get THAT notion from? I'm from southern Europe, I'd be devastated.
They literally do not have the attention span for relationships.
I'd say so is the case with young attractive male zoomers too, but I get what you mean
It's just nowhere near grounded in reality to how the relationship dynamics work. Someone attractive is perceived as charismatic, while someone unattractive is perceived as uncharismatic. Someone unattractive being confident is considered "creepy". 
Look at the image you sent me. If the genders were changed do you think the situation would be much different?

lol 
all of the downsides and none of the upsides 
little early
<comment>

Vaguely remember some word having an extra 'u' where it shouldn't exist. Kek. But yes, our dynamics might be even moreso different in which case. When I was in eastern europe I just saw average guys with wives. You don't see that here.
If the genders were changed do you think the situation would be much different?
Yes. If you unironically think it would be, we just live in completely different worlds. You don't understand the psychic trials of living in a dying world.
<comment>

Yes.
I probably botched the wording but, basically a girl making an unwanted advance has no social repercussions, while a guy making an unwanted advance makes the girl "feel unsafe", which has significant social drawbacks because you're seen as a threat and a creep
<comment>

NTA, but it's not only about looks, which the comic implies.

Really? I see a lot of ugly/average guys go out with gorgeous girls in a many different circumstances 
Yes.
No anon, she would be met with the same pity and disgust as her male counterpart... What do you even think would happen?
<comment>
"feel unsafe", which has significant social drawbacks because you're seen as a threat and a creep
You usually just make her feel extremely uncomfortable, not unsafe. It also depends entirely on the personality of the one that's rejecting
But by what you said you imply both would get turned down, which is essentially my point
<comment>

kill yourself
<comment>
the same pity and disgust
I think most men (at least from the nerd group I'm in) are easy and that a girl being nice to you is a surefire way of her getting in a relationship with you. A guy being nice to a girl is a surefire way to become friends with her, and nothing more than that ever again. It's why men "hit on" women, if they introduce themselves as anything else other than a romantic prospect, that's how they're defined for the rest of the 'relationship'. So yeah, the female counterpart would probably get rejected, but only because the guy would think that it's a trap to get the rest of the girls to laugh at him, like in high school. "You ACTUALLY thought I liked you. Hahaha!~" and so forth.
People don't really feel disgust and pity towards women here, maybe pity on an existential level where they're cursed with the tendency to blow problems out of proportion, but otherwise not particularly. A girl with a good personality can easily get into a relationship, the male counterpart not so much, was what I was saying.
which is essentially my point
I must have missed it.
<comment>
I don't think you understand the masculine pain of having to interact with somebody you really desire sexually and romantically, who doesn't reciprocate your feelings. The energy is pure suicidal. 
I wouldn't expect you to know, you're just a woman. Everything in love and relationships has been handed to you, you will never spend years upon years alone and isolated from any friend circle because its simply not how women live. You will never know male pain.
<comment>
Jesus, you're a walking fucking stereotype.
<comment>
If he's such a incel/'nice guy' prick for going cold after getting rejected, why do you still want him in your life at all? Why do you still crave his attention? What's done is done, it's not like you guys had an actual relationship.
<comment>
To be fair, she's asking why he's acting that way.
<comment>
There are two types of relationships between men and women. Romantic and non-existant. Simple as.

have crush on woman
make proposition
get rejected
accept it and stop talking to her
I mean, what do you want me to do, torture myself by continuing to be around someone I want but can't be with?

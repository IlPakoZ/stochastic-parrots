Have you ever been complimented on your height and if so what is your height?
<comment>
I have been complimented on my dick size (17cm).
<comment>
my girlfriend tells me I am tall constantly. I am merely 6 foot, but she is a 5 foot 4 womanlet, so I SEEM tall to her

DO ANY 6FT + ROBOTS NEED COMPLIMENTING
<comment>

<comment>
I'm 6'2. I've been complimented on it, but not out of the blue. I, like most men, almost never got any compliments. Did have gfs, though, and they did mention liking my height.
<comment>
why would somebody compliment your height
im 6'2 but idk why that would happen
<comment>
I can compliment you some more on it if you like
<comment>
You'd have to be my gf first to match the pattern, though.
<comment>
6 ft 2? done deal im yours forever
<comment>
Are you female? Body count? Goblin height?
<comment>
yes BC 2, 5'5
<comment>
I'm not tall so maybe only once by a girl.
was 5'9 since middle school but found out I was 5'6 last year. Everyone I've met who is also 5'6 Is shorter than me.
I've come up with 3 answers: I'm actually 5'9 and they got the measurement wrong, I'm 5'6 but everyone lies ab their height due to insecurity, or I'm 5'6 but the copium is so strong that it goes into my video settings and changes my FOV whenever talking to someone who is 5'6
Can anyone relate?

5'3. Got complimented once during my part time as barista once and I feel like that day of praise is going to keep me up even in rough days.

Last two questions: where are you at and how clingy are you?
<comment>
US and sadly im insanely clingy
<comment>
I need more precision, anon. What state and what does it mean to be insanely clingy to you?
<comment>
TX currently and trust me too clingy
<comment>
I'm thinking of moving to Texas potentially, but that would be in two years at the earliest. The no income tax, big houses and absence of snow are pretty appealing.
A bit too far for now, but still curious about the clinginess. What's insane about it?

You'd have to kill every man except the shortest guy alive, anon. If you kill the tallest guy in the world, the second tallest guy in the world becomes the tallest guy in the world--ad infinitum.

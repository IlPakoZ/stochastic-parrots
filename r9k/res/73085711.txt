I'm good looking, fit and confident with good facial aesthetics. The only reason I've never had sex is because I never had my own room, a car, or privacy to talk on the phone at home. It's almost impossible, unless a woman would invite me over to her place that I can get to without talking on the phone first. More specifically, I sleep in my parents' living room, so zero privacy except to fap quietly after they go to bed. Also can't talk out loud without my parents or neighbors in the apartment hallway overhearing everything I say, when someone does call me, I don't answer and then try to text tor email them, chicks think this is really weird or just pathetic. 
Compare all this to a guy who has his own place or a private room in his parents' house, and a car. He can simply meet women outside or online, call them up, pick them up, take them out, and bring them home. I can't do shit. Women smile at me all the time, but there's literally nothing I can do about it, like what's the point even. I'm not that young either, so they will immediately lose interest when they find out I'm a NEET with nothing, like no one expects that. Work life was too depressing though. I once rented a room and worked full time, but had irregular house, and never had time to socialize or get my drivers' license while wagecucking. This life is much better, and I would choose it over having sex but having to be a wagecuck again.

Dude you're probably just 18 right now. get a job and save up and see if you can get a house or apartment with friends or something. 
Compare this to me who didn't realize he was good looking and that girls were always trying to talk with him not as a joke but because they were interested

I was ugly in high school because of severe acne. Back then it was even worse for socializing, since I wasn't allowed anywhere without parental supervision.

I think you're glazing over massive issues you have. Not having your own place, car, or a job at 22+ is a huge red flag, severe social anxiety just makes it even worse. I talk to a lot of women from here, who supposedly have low standards, and one of the first questions they all ask me is if I have a job. If even femanonons from r9k care if you have a job etc. then normies will even more.

I haven't got the faintest clue how I managed it as a neet but I did. I'll surely lose her at some point and probably rope

OP im literally you in female form
decently attractive, guys flirt with me in public/get stares/get simps calling me gorgeous on social media platforms
literally cannot pursue any of those relationships because I still live with my parents
our ONLY solution is to get any kind of job that pays barely enough for a studio apt and youll be drowning in pussy. 
better yet, why wont you just take out a loan and enroll in any kind of university so you can finally live independently. that could be an option too, i already got my degree so im hardstuck waiting on employers to hire me
anyways the economy is literally forcing us to be involuntarily celibate. i feel your pain lol

tfw am pretty good at flirting with girls but still live at home so no relationships 
I don't think boomers realize how much the cost of living issue plays into young people not dating or having sex. No one wants to bring a girl back to their parents' place, and no girl wants to date a guy without his own place or car. Unironically my biggest motivation for moving out is so I can start dating and seeing girls.

it's really the only motivation. consequently all my closest friends still live at home. every single one of them

Yup, 20+ years ago you could move out on a part time job. Now even if you work min wage full time you'll be living paycheck to paycheck at best. Boomers are a leach generation.

No thanks, I'd rather be NEET and free and sexless than go back to literal slavery for the possibility I can enjoy such things in the limited time left. It's a catch-22.
<comment>
absolutely. in my case i also grew up in a religious household that didn't allow me to date as a teenager, so as a grown adult i can't just hop on facetime with a guy within earshot of my parents lol. its actually really depressing especially when you know you're hot and imagine on all the cool people you're missing out on
<comment>
This is something I stress about daily now that I've managed to have sex as a neet. I know it won't last and then it's back to suffering
I look at part time job listings daily in an attempt to preserve some semblance of freedom and they're all dogshit jobs
<comment>
get a loan
anon do not do this whatever you fucking do lmao
<comment>
okay, that's your prerogative but it will weigh in to your mental health because romance and companionship is a necessity akin to food,water,air. good luck
but really, why not just say fuck it and take out a 50k loan and go to four-year university, you don't work at all and you just don't pay the loan at all in the future.

Relatable, also grew up in a religious household and passed on many relationships because of it. Weirdly I've gotten good at talking to people, but can never capitalize on it since 'hey let's go back to my childhood room in my parents' house' isn't exactly a panty dropper. Not having a car basically makes it impossible to meet people in a suburban hellscape as well. For now I just cope with typical 4chins/discord shit, but hoping to move out soon and have actual relationships.

so his only other option is to rot at home with no friends or gf until he's what... 40 and on the brink to death? he's made it very clear that he'd rather waste his life away neeting and staying lonely on his parents couch than work and thats completely valid because waging is slavery. but going to school is pretty fun and easy if you're only doing it to meet people. its basically a 4 yr vacation, and the banks are giving out loans for college like fucking nothing, and they'll eventually be forgiven in like 20-30 years. so in his exact situation, why is it a bad idea
not having a car fucking sucks. i share a car with my parents at least but you're basically beached. i hope you can find a decent paying job and able to move out and find a qt soon. i also only browse and post on this board as cope too
<comment>
Lol uni schizo is back. My gf is getting ass raped by student loans still, we just had a discussion about it last week
Don't listen to this retard OP
<comment>

It's not
Also I already have a degree and no debt. Just not gonna be a wagecuck and rentcuck ever again, simple as.

Pretty much, I'm sure we'll both make it soon enough. Step one is just get a job and/or move out, gl anon.

I did that multiple times, and it was always the same shit: Work full time to afford rent, have irregular hours and no time to socialize outside work, commute and weekly chores of living. Like after work I didn't want to do shit cause I had to be in bed soon anyways, one day off I did laundry, shopping and food prep, other day I often got called in for overtime and I had no excuse not to, couldn't make plans or join activities cause hours always changing, just no way to life, like modern day slavery.
<comment>
I'm assuming you're op, I'd recommend getting a college degree and/or moving to a lower CoL area. We live in very unaffordable times, it's the biggest headwind on relationships for young adults.
<comment>
Are americans really this cucked by their economy? Can't you just fuck when your parents aren't home, or in a club bathroom, or somewhere secluded? As a balkanfag, I am lmaoing so hard right now.
<comment>
No we don't have abandoned bunkers we can just bring girls into and fuck.
<comment>
We're really this cucked. My turk friend always confused or appalled when I tell him how life is here. He encourages me to talk to women IRL all the time but it isn't that simple.
<comment>
People claimed I was good looking, but I am a bald manlet incel NEET who is too aspie to hold a job.
The only reason I have my own place is because my folks died.
I'm almost 37 and have been waiting for death for many years.
<comment>
Do you even try tho?
bald
Hope you mean you shave your head all the way, no walk around half bald like George Costanza
<comment>
I tried to work. Too aspie.
I tried to socialise. Too aspie and poor.
I used to shave my head in my 20s, while I rapidly baldceled between 23-28. I don't bother anymore. I grew a beard instead.

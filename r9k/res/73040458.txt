i don't know how to talk about anything normies find interesting or even other spergs find interesting. have job and can make polite conversation with coworkers when i have to. they probably think i'm weird but they're aren't mean to me. that's about the extent of my social interaction except a ten minute phone call to my parents once a week. i am too autistic to have much to talk about to them. is it possible for me to get gf
talk to them about groverhaus
if you meet someone you get along with and have chemistry with, it'll be easy to talk about anything. however, the sad thing is that for autists and mentally ill people, the % of people who they have chemistry with naturally is very small.

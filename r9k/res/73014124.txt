<comment>
I'm not having any problems recently. How about you OP?

Girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me, found out she cheated on me twice, once with my best friend
<comment>
I have to go to class in a shitty costume to give a presentation. The costume thing doesn't bother me too much, it's more the fact that I know I'm not gonna remember what I have to say.
<comment>
Don't have any problems, been sick but life is good. Have a bump
<comment>
Thats good to hear, anon. For me, not recently, just normal stuff about not getting along with my coworkers. But ive already accepted my fate. Visited my parents and siblings. I feel so happy. We didnt do anything special, just talked and ate together. I havent felt this happy in so long that i feel like im ready to die now.
<comment>
You should consider suicide
You should consider homicide
<comment>
thanks asshole, already tried that
<comment>
Going to die alone because of my BPD
in one of my worst depressive episodes at the moment
fired from my shitty job last year because I missed too much work
no one else will hire me so I'm living in my abusive parents' basement
<comment>
Im sorry to hear that, anon. This is gonna sound faggy, but have you tried writing a journal? If you feel lonely, writing feels like youre writing to yourself as well as articulating your feeling which helps with self-awareness. Thats my suggestion, you dont have to do it though. This thread is about listening and replying anyways
<comment>
I have considered,I don't think it's worth it. I did beat my friend though.
<comment>
Thanks anon. That might help. I think I spend so much time on her (4chan) just feeling bad about myself, it would probably just be healthier to get those negative thoughts out on paper.
<comment>
Sounds like their a bunch of bitches. If there are no consequences, i would have recommended a double homicide like the other anon, but theyre not worth it. These bitches have no value to you now, its time to find someone better. Easier said than done, but i believe in you, anon
<comment>
I am trying to delay using machinery that will dismember me. I'm confident it won't but not so confident I want to run out and do it right way.
<comment>
Public speaking is a common fear. My advice is to focus on the message youre presenting, not the audience. Deep breaths also help
<comment>
I wanna COOM 
But I have a specific fantasy in mind rn and none of the audios cover it. Im stuck on porn searching step
<comment>
I don't have anything worrying me too much these past few days. I just wanted to say it's very nice of you to make this thread :)
<comment>
Use your imagination, man. Porn is overrated, nothing beats pure fantasy. Use your brain.
<comment>
That sucks. The real world is too overwhelming for non-neurotypical individuals. Well, actually normies do get overwhelmed to sometimes. But its worse for us mentally imperfect individuals. Im not familiar with the common coping mechanisms of BPD, but ill suggest something very simple. Listen to music that you love, and allow yourself to enjoy the little things without guilting yourself
<comment>
Sure, anon. I agree that spending too much time here can be mentally unhealthy. Source, me. This place can become an echo chamber that encourages doomer behavior. Although, i agree with their philosophy that there is no meaning to life. I would like to give my own, and try to enjoy it. Ill keep trying
<comment>
Thank you for the advice, Anon.
I'll be sure to give it a whirl.
<comment>
I'm incredibly shy and reserved, I only started dated her because my friend introduced me to her and I still took a while to warm up to her and truly start being comfortable, and she was apparently incredibly accepting. Now I don't even know how to do that, how do I find someone I can trust and will love me and do anything with me?
<comment>
Ive been there. I dont really have any advice for that. I hope you see a good porno that fits your fantasy soon though
<comment>
Thats sweet, im glad theres not anything bad in particular happening to you now
<comment>
You dont have to do it right away, anon. You dont have to find the one right away. Trying to find one while youre hurting will just make you hurt even more. And we dont want that. If you feel like intimacy with touch is of importance to you right now, hire a safe sex worker to fuck. Or if you have enough courage and rizz, a one night stand
<comment>
I just got diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. Seems my body has a countdown now.
<comment>
Its gonna sound bad but Im jealous
<comment>
Thanks, anon. I'm very into music, it's always been my biggest coping mechanism so I have definitely been listening to a lot recently. There's not really much else you can do to cope except maybe get blackout drunk kek but I'm a recovering alcoholic so I'm trying to avoid that for now.
<comment>
No gf, I am a kissless virgin at 26
<comment>
That is very difficult. The world has been tough on you. I dont have any suggestions except for preparation and acceptance of the inevitable. Reality is a bitch, it chose you to fuck over and you dont deserve any of this pain. Anon, ill be here for probably a few more hours. You can share more of your feelings if it makes you feel better.
<comment>
I would like to ask, how old are you, anon? This type of leukemia is most common amongst the old. And are you the Unluckiest Man Alive guy
<comment>
Thanks but it's not such a big drama for me. I'm not very attached to this life.
<comment>
Avoiding alcohol is pretty impressive, especially in a depressive state. Ill give you that, anon. Ive been an alcoholic as well, what stopped me was my heartburn was getting worse and made me very sensitive to acidic foods that something remotely acidic like coffee is enough to make me vomit. It was a physiological need to stop, it actually hurt me to drink. I hope you continue your streak. Youve done well
<comment>
Thats okay. Me too, just a little bit older at 28
<comment>
I'm 23. I have damaged genes from birth, so it was most likely that I get cancer sooner or later. Didn't came as a surprise. Now I have to decide if I want to take the fucking toxic medication. Propably not.
<comment>
I know how you feel. I'm very mentally ill and I know it's horrible but I've often wished I'd develop a serious physical illness for many reasons, the two main ones being so someone might actually care about me for once and so I can die without having to kill myself. It makes me feel like shit to think this way because I know people who are battling their illnesses would think I'm a terrible person.
<comment>
Dont guilt yourself over this. Youre starved of love and you want to end your life. Thats two birds in one stone. I do hope someone will love you, anon. It doesnt need to be romantically or sexually. If you have real friends, please remember them. If you dont, i hope you make some. God, do i need one of those too, thank god i have family though
<comment>
I don't know Anon, I have no idea what feelings do I have, I stopped caring about everything a log time ago, now I'm just living to feed myself.
Have a good day Anon.
<comment>
I have a smaller than average dick and I'm looking for a girlfriend whose vaginal opening is 2-3 inches deep. What physical indicators do women have that can help me determine the length of their vaginal opening?
<comment>
Small-ish dick. Not small enough that I can be sure women wouldn't like it, but small enough that the fear is real. It's the uncertainty that sucks the most.
<comment>
Getting older(I turn 27 soon)
No career
No skills
Shit part time warehouse job
Live with parents
Lonely
Depressed
Bad social anxiety 
Cannot talk to women at all
<comment>
Not OP, but have you considered commissioning someone? Voice actors for NSFW stuff can be found on twitter and are usually relatively cheap I think.
<comment>
Stress, isolation, and anxiousness. Three ingredients that can make a man go crazy or make him numb and empty. Ive felt something like this, but probably not as bad as others and not as bad as yours. I dont know if this will help, but what i do is sing. It kind of helps me. Or consume content that you know is sad, like a sad show or movie, just so you could feel something. Try to enjoy yourself without being too self-concious. This may sound retarded but i still hope youll give it a try if youre not too busy. But what do i know, im just here to listen and reply
<comment>
I have in the past, but now the only creators Im interested in have their commissions closed. TmT
<comment>
That is a problem that i dont know an easy answer of. Ive seen a thread about this and a reply that says about an asexual woman. Kind of difficult to find, but the internet helps with that finding. This may be an answer you may not like, but maybe some girl would just accept and love you despite this and accepts that you may use a garter belt. Ill be honest with you, anon, you have a difficult road ahead of you. I best you the best of luck
<comment>
Oh, i didnt read the continuation of your reply, anon. YOULL BE FINE, youll get pussy just fine with that dick. Women are not that particular about size unless theyre hoes
<comment>
i realize any woman i date probably makes more than me and i feel like a useless parasite for being on welfare
i look down at gun barrels and see death
<comment>
My advice may not be something you want to hear but ill type it anyway, anon. Exercise. Helps you look good, feel good due to endorphin release, and helps with increasing libido. This will help with youre confidence. My social anxiety is pretty bad too, my coworkers hates me for keeping my mouth shut. It takes courage to speak up, and so i did. Tried to be friendly in the most awkward way, but they realized that im not so bad after all and probably saw that i made effort for speaking. Although, they can still be dick sometimes, but less so now. I hope your parents are good people, fren. You can practice some socializing through them instead of ignoring them too
<comment>
Thanks OP. That's all I needed to hear. :)
<comment>
Its okay if a woman makes more than you. If youre worried about not getting a girl for this specific reason, i dont think you need to worry too much. Dom mommies are high in demand, and because of that, the supply is also increasing.

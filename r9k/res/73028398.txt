HE WAS A FUXKING LONELY INCEL

Add two and two together. Women are very friendly, accepting people. If absolutely no woman wants a scrote, it's for a good reason. No one wants him. Why would you want him? You really couldn't see this red flag? You paid the toll.

Ah but women did want him, how else could he have cheated on her?

stay away from incels!
Meanwhile theres like 3-4 threads on the first page from supposed "femcels/fembots". I swear women are just irl bugged NPCs

That's not hard to accomplish after getting laid once. He was an incel when she met him.

Not very attractive and want someone who will be loyal
Pick the handsome and fit guy who is just self-limiting because of a lack of confidence
lmao
Any halfway intelligent guy who wanted a loyal girl would know to pick a fat girl or a cripple or something, not a very hot girl with mental problems.

No, he was just a virgin. If he was celibate it was his own doing.

mmmmm, i just toke a test to find out something i already know. good test
I'm ok with that because I learned to cope with most of it. I don't even think I would enjoy spending too much of my time with friends.
Also if the test as honest there wouldn't be anything lower than 30% maybe, because when the fuck any normal human being find himself doing such test. Just clicking the button "start test" indicates a problem

I blow an Aztec death whistle outside during my night shifts to scare the local crackies, but they are all too drunk or drugged out to get scared. Very sad. Pic related.
What? Was that even a coherent sentence?
based af anon, idk maybe try to blow two at the same time maybe theyll get more scared that way.

every now and then i remember that in 9th grade a girl in 8th grade had a crush on me and would try talking to me in the hallways and on messenger. i was new at the school and when i told some guy i was friends with he adviced me to stay away. by fear of association i didn't let her in, just because some asshole told me to. fuck.

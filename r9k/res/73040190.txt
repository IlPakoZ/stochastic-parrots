You're the bully not us.
You're the NPC not us.
You're the conformist not us.
You're the evil one not us.
You're the immoral one not us.
You're the one going to Hell not us.
You're the perverted one not us (each and every one of them has hundreds of gigabytes of porn on their phones).
Why do normies do this?

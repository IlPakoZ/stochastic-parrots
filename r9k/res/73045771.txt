how do i find a tracker on my car ? what does it look like and where would they (feds) put it at ? asking for a friend's hypothetical situation..
realistically, if they didn't put your car on a lift, the tracker should be somewhere you can reach it.
In the movies they usually put them in the area above the tires or in the gas tank lid

Fuck if this is true this is gonna suck, was my first relationship too. Guess I will cope with Christ or something.

Tbf I don't think it's necessarily that fast it might take longer than that. However it's mainly the very long term you need to watch out for. 
I know the usual robot narrative is the opposite but imo men are the ones that tend to be hung up over exes in the very long term. Had a friend of a friend sort of dude I knew who killed himself over an ex that had dumped him over a decade prior which is kind of crazy to imagine

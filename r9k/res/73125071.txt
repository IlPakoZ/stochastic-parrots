WHY THE FUCK DOES SPOTIFY KEEP CHANGING THE UI. I JUST GOT USED TO THE LAST ONE
Is there any point in using spotify? Everything worthwhile is on Youtube already where I can use adblock and don't need an app.
Yeah, better quality and layout and playlists and youtube is just messy and has ads and spotify memories and sheiit
I don't know about quality and you're probably right about playlists (Youtube does have them, they're just a hassle to search through). But Youtube is also more vulnerable to adblock than Spotify is, at least in my experience. I've never had any ads on Youtube neither on PC nor on mobile.

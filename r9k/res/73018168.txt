How do I get neetbux? I just worked my first wagie job today and I fucking hated it.

Now that you have proven you are capable of waging they will never let you on neetbux again. 
Same thing happened to me. I was on disability bux in UK for 8 years straight. Got sick of the life and gave it up to become a wagie. Biggest mistake of my life.

get a 3 day hold for suicidal thoughts (go to a hospital and tell them you want to hurt yourself.) then apply for major depression. The process will take months, and they will always deny you the first time, you have to keep applying and might have to get a lawyer. 
the 3 day hold will stop you from being able to poses guns, nor live with anyone that does. Don't know if that effects you but bear it in mind if your family do, either they have to get rid of them or you cannot live with them in the same house.

kek. give it a few years and you'll be the most experienced dude there. plenty of teen poon to creep out. 
younger new girls will be head over heels for you if you can be helpful without patronizing them.

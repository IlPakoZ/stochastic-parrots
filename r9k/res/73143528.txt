One day you will be old and you will say to yourself, why didn't I do anything? And the difference between then and now is you will have to answer yourself.
nah i put in all the effort and got nowhere. the only question i will be able to ask myself is "why did i even bother"
simple as.
There is a difference between dropping out and knowing when to quit, creating a defeatist mentality for yourself only digs you a hole deeper for yourself; yes I am now an armchair psychologist suck my dick haha
I have a big hole in my mind. I don't need people but somehow I now have the distant taste of what I think is loneliness or some kind of unrest but being with people doesn't help. It feels like I'm constantly on hot coals. I'm sure it will pass. The hole in my mind offers me no knowledge in trying. I'm actually fine but sometimes my brain crumbles so I can build it back up again
cope lol, I will always be a better psychologist than you faggot bitch nigger
And I just won the argument thanks retard :)

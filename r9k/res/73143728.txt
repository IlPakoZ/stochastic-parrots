Lately there's been a big linguistic shift in the UN and other international organizations, they've replaced "women and children" with "women and girls." Seems like adult women are angling to get rushed to the front of the line ahead of even 3 year old boys when shit hits the fan.
What do you think? If the Titanic occurred today, would boys get rescued, or would they be on the "leave to die" list like the rest of the penis-havers?
Alot of women actually did die on the titanic. But if it happened today you'd probably have simps making sure m'lady gets a seat before anyone else, and yes they'd probably throw other men overboard if it means they can even get a smidgen of puss puss. 
And while men are doing that women would courageously shed feminism all of the sudden and take their place on the escape boats as born again redpilled tradwives.

It's not fair that I live here, in the midwest, and all the prettiest girls such as this live in South America.

Seriously, is it just me or is she really uniquely lovely?

I personally know at least 100 girls that are prettier than her. All south american latinas.
But yeah, pretty girl anyways, a bit overweight but cute nonetheless. If she was a bit lighter she'd be a smokeshow.

That isn't possible, she is in the top 20 of girls I have seen this year.

I don't like her hair.

Imagine being down bad so hard that goblin mode la creatura de Tejas looks attractive.

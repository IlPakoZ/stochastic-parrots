How do you survive when bad things stack up and there's no more anything good in your life to balance it out?
Years ago I entered a life of no fun, no rewards, no women, no sex, no validation...
Then little by little all the bad shit started piling up. Today I got screamed at at work and I had had enough. I threatened to kill the dude and got fired on the spot, they might take legal action too. I've just had it with this life. I can no longer lead a life with 100% pain and 0% joy.
idk, just don't threaten people. you should've just quit instead
When things happen to you, most of the time it's bad. If you want good things to happen, you have to make them happen.
I'm tired of you fags telling me I can get a gf if I just "put in the effort and go out".
I'm 35 and I've been going out my ass off, without finding anyone. Cant even relate to women my own age for that matter. The agepill is brutal, I cant do anything about it.

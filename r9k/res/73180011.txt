Nothing. It's made of some kind of imitation leather that doesn't absorb smell

Plastic chair. Smells like plastic.

I wear very short shorts so when I game and get sweaty the area between my thighs and the chair gets the gross sour smell.

Laundry soap. I keep a blanket over it and throw it in the wash with my bedding whenever it needs a clean.

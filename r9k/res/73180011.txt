What does your computer chair smell like right now!?
shit and sweat
I sit/lay romamstyle in my bed while browsing the web, my tv is my screen
Tactical soap
farts, sweat, body odor, and just everything vile really.
Nothing. It's made of some kind of imitation leather that doesn't absorb smell
Plastic chair. Smells like plastic.
I wear very short shorts so when I game and get sweaty the area between my thighs and the chair gets the gross sour smell.
Laundry soap. I keep a blanket over it and throw it in the wash with my bedding whenever it needs a clean.
Damn, for a second I thought that was going to be a gif of that guys chair exploding and all the metal parts going up his anus. This sub has fucked with my mind.
Seriously, you do NOT want to know
Musky Ballsweat, which is also my pen name

Is there a reliable, foolproof method of turning oneself gay? The closest Ive managed to get is being sexually and emotionally attracted to pre-op MtF trannygenders. 
But seeing as they are such a tiny percentage of the population (with passable ones being an even smaller percentage) it hardly widens my pool of options at all.

masturbate and then right when your about to finish switch to gay porn as you're cuming and keep watching it for a few minutes so your brain associates hairy men with orgasming.
I think there was some study and they were able to make the men sexually attracted to shoes this way(not girls wearing shoes but shoes themselves) so you can probably make yourself gay this way too.

I dont masturbate though. I have been nofapping for 117 days straight. Not even a single stroke that entire time.

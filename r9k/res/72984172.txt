Hi R9K,
I just got out of an insane relationship with a very insecure girl.
Now that I am single, after not caring for 2 years, I didn't realize that I have found the confidence and looks to actually pick up women. 
Do I log off now? What the fuck I kinda like it here but I feel terrible seeing people complain about being KHHV's. Is there somewhere I can donate?

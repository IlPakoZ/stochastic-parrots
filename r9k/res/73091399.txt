I've never in my life bought a pack of cigarettes. The only times I smoke are at the rest breaks at work when by chance someone offers me one since I just go outside and look at the city. Happens once every few days.
I don't think I'm addicted since I don't ask for smokes nor I buy them. I just do it from time to time since I think I look cooler smoking.

Smokes every few days.
Yea you're a smoker, if it only happened like a few times a month I would say you're not, but every few days is quite a lot.

Buy a pack and leave it in your pocket.
Only way to find out.

You have to be smoking at least a few cigarettes everyday for a while to be addicted but it does creep up on you fast. And it starts out by borrowing one here and there from friends. Then you're buying your own pack. Then that one a day is three a day. Then 15 a day.

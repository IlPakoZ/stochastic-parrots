How can I effectively be more cruel to people in meaningful ways? I have determined it would help me meet my ideal person.
<comment>
Also I am very non charismatic and only interact with anyone online. So I am fairly restricted in some ways.
<comment>
call them ugly
<comment>
bump. i wanna learn how to be effectively cruel sometimes too
<comment>
that is not meaningful to me I want to really hurt them more deeply than just something shallow.
<comment>
Can you please explain to me how this would help you meet your ideal person? Its an interesting theory, do you think that only torture will lead them to develop into there ideal state?
<comment>
People like those that can harm others so I will have more people to sift through. Also yes it would be useful if that is necessary.
<comment>
Describe your ideal person.

I don't think this is true, unsulky those who like to hangout with trashy abusive people are those that are also trashy and abusive. Hence they enjoy spending time together since the have something in common. Anyway deeply hurting someone is done through preying on there insecurities and weaknesses, just learn about them and find out things that can help you then use it against them.

No friends or romantic partner, preferably androgynous and single, caring and emotional, incredibly isolated at a point in their life, a lot of other things.

You say the forbidden things, that go even farther that would make glowniggers blush, just don't end up going viral, so make a speedy getaway.

become a passionate vegan, and really genuinely care for the animals and debate with people that eating meat is wrong. do so passionately and genuinely
after a while you will really start to grow and hate everyone. you will really despite people. and so it will be harder to feel compassion for their suffering
but you dont care about being cruel to people. you just want to hurt people, regardless of morals, because you want some pussy, because you're +1 to the endless army of simps who would sell their soul for a drop of old used up hag cunt
but you wont get pussy, because you are UGLY and because you are mentally ill and autistic. your FACE is ugly. your mental illnesses are repulsive
<comment>
I already care for animals and hate people more than you.
pussy
I have had sex a number of times with women and did not like it. I am literally gay. 
ugly 
I am. 
mental illnesses are repulsive
Being normal is worse in my eyes. You built a very elaborate strawman there to burn down. good luck with that
<comment>
are you like a sociopath? or a sadist or something
<comment>
I am not a sociopath. Sadist is yet to be seen.
<comment>
i feel like you cannot really say for sure unless you've hurt someone before. have u done that? or been hurt by another person
<comment>
I wish you would be cruel to me anon
<comment>
Not irl. I have had others hurt themselves for me out of their own desire to do so and I liked it. 
I have been hurt many times. I am quite sensitive.
<comment>
I already care for animals
what does that even mean?
are you vegan?
and hate people more than you
im willing to concede that people like you exist, but thats a really impressive feat. for example, ive been so desperate for an apocalypse for so many years, that i become obsessed with with technological singualrity as a potential apocalypse, simply because i hate people that much
and i honestly doubt you are capable of hating people that deeply, because of your past. i dont think sex havers can hate humans as much as virgins, because you experienced some of the fundamental basic joys thats available to humans
and you are gay, so sex is cheap and easy and comes freely to you. other faggots dont care if you are cruel, besides some kind of masochist
this to me seems unlikely that you hate people more than me, but okay. im not going to contest you because i dont know you
all i know is that you are a sex having faggot normie who cant relate to the suffering of robots
<comment>
hmmmm. thats interesting
<comment>
are you vegan 
You being vegan or not has no meaningful input on the industries that kill those animals.
desperate for an apocalypse 
I specifically would like human extinction. I actually was reading about AI things recently and it made me happy there might be a possibility for that to end things, it is poetic I think. 
doubt you are capable of hating people that deeply
I dont care about if you believe me or not particularly.
sex is easy and cheap to you
I have never had gay sex. your point is moot.
normie
Others have said so and admitted I am not a normie after weeks of me following them around in threads and cutting myself, I dont feel like doing the same to you to prove I am too mentally ill to function in society at this point. I am also not going to attempt to live up to your arbitrary standards. Leave my thread and contribute to AI research for both of our sakes or kill your self, I do not care which.
<comment>
You being vegan or not has no meaningful input on the industries that kill those animals.
i think its reasonable to assume that you are not a vegan, due to you being a shameless pathetic cowardly faggot and dodging the question
you dodge the question because its uncomfortable
and i dont think you can fully appreciate what it means to be a misanthrope unless you're a vegan, because you cant fully appreciate hating people for their hypocrisy if you're a hypocrite yourself
you're also a sex having faggot normie, which is a point you also dodged
not a robot, you should fuck off
<comment>
leave the thread then you whiny little bitch.

The entre concept of mental illness, as judged by a civilization that is itself so fundamentally ill is a cope.
A technological apocalypse is unlikely, in my opinion. A post-technological apocalypse is more viable. Complex civilizations require decisions to be made by people with long time horizons. These people percolate over time into positions of centralized power. Meanwhile, the people remaining outside of centralized power suffer from brain-drain, deracination, and genetic decay, becoming less able to make decisions without central guidance. Inevitably, systems break down over time. The current global civilization revolves around the united states, not because of any value the united states provides, but because the military power which keeps the world-civilization stable. As the united states suffers from social, and genetic bifurcation it moves towards a cultural mitosis, where two new nations form whose customs are not mutually intelligible. This results in a failure of the world-civilization as a whole. Without NATO force, regional powers like the EU break down, and with all long-time-horizon leadership concentrated in national or supranational organizations, the breakdown of nations leads to a cascading collapse of power towards tribal and subtribal scales. Without national-scale power, global agriculture breaks dawn, and with it all post-1800s technology. Billions will die. it's going to be great. The world war will result in one of three outcomes: Total western victory means the realization of the world-civilization, unopposed, which collapses uniformly with the fall of the united states. Even partial eastern victory leads to a temporary multipolarity, which temporarily stabilizes the system, while allowing more instability to ferment under the service, leading to an even more disastrous collapse. A full nuclear exchange would lead to an immediate collapse of power, and would probably be the best.
omg literally me
<comment>
Are you saying you want that or are that. I have not kept up or do I have the intelligence to meaningfully comment on the large analysis you wrote, frankly.
<comment>
I mean, I am that for the most part. Not visually androgynous, although I'm sur I could be if I tried.
Tl:dr
the government is going to go away, leading to everyone starving, leading to a century of cowboy samurai tribes fighting for survival in the omnidirectional frontier
Societal collapse is going to be super hype and we don't even need ai or nukes or aliens or anything to make it happen.
<comment>
for the most part
in what ways are you not. 
Your scenario does not seem that likely to me but I have nothing but intuition to base that claim on. I do hope society collapses soon though, in general human extinction would be optimal.

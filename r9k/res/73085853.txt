Fembot here and I only hear whine after whine from incels here about how hard it is to go on a date. Well guess what I just did? I went on a damn date with a brand new guy, and it was my third one this week.
We had a nice dinner, went out for drinks, went back to his apartment and had rounds of sex after watching Netflix.
All these men can do it. I can do it. Why can't you? There was nothing special about him or me either. He works at a financial office, only makes $82k, and he's 5'11". Did I complain even once or turn him down for sex after he kissed me tonight? Nope.
So, honestly. Maybe you don't get dates because you spend all your time here hating women instead of having sex. Just some food for thought.

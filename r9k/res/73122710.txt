hey Anon, come to the club with us!
<comment>
Every single one of them will come into contact with black dick at that club throughout the course of the night.
<comment>
The one on the left looks like she might be bearable to be around at least.
<comment>
Hell yeah, you think you could introduce me to some hot chicks?
<comment>
wow anon I didn't know you were such a bbc chad
<comment>
would fuck the weird middle one only
<comment>
What's weird about her, she seems hot
<comment>
Not paying your drinks
<comment>
totally not obsessed and gay, nosir
<comment>
Be me in college
There for my piece of paper and a job, not a party
Get invited out for a friend's birthday
Whatever, he's cool so I go
Go to local club/bar that the huge university students always goes to
Filled with boring looking chuds and roasties
A couple of friends are on the dance floor
Think "Fuck it" and join em
Grooving hard while drunk
Having a great time
Roastie out there with a couple of her friends
Smile and nod at her
She yells at me "You're really fuckin' weird"
Laugh
Lean towards her
"Better to be weird and fun than a boring cunt"
Shimmy away
All night her and her friends shooting me dirty looks
Make kissy faces at them, knowing I'm pissing them off
Leave the dance floor to take a breather
Sweaty but having a good time
Bouncer comes over to me and asks "What I was doing to those women"
Laughed again and told him the story saying "I dunno what they told you, but that's all it is. If you want me to leave, that's fine because I don't care, but that's what happened"
Buddy of mine vouched for me
Bouncer leaves us
Good night
One of the guys in our group was pissed cause he was trying to score with one of them, but I could care less. I was there to have fun and let loose.
<comment>
Will you lick their BBC cumfilled pussies at the end of the night though?
<comment>
middle would be sluttiest
left is most attractive
others are non attractive therefore have no value
<comment>
So basically you were an overly sexual creep making them uncomfortable and harassing them all night and your friends covered for you because one of them rejected his sexual advances. 
Wow, and people hate us m0ids. I wonder why.
<comment>
Exhibit A why clubs aren't worth visiting
<comment>
Harassing them
Yup, sure was chief! Making a few gestures to piss them off was being "Overly sexual". Hell I wasn't even the one who started the conversation, I was MORE than happy to ignore them, but...That was not the case.
<comment>
Yeah because of creeper m0ids with inferiority complexes who cant take rejection or no for an answer.
<comment>
it was so nice meeting y'all!! 
*drunkily drunk drunks*
*pisses and vomits*
<comment>
Eh, depends on the people you're with. If you go with the express purpose to get drunk and groove to some music and not with the purpose to get laid, you may enjoy it.
<comment>
You said you repeatedly made kissy faces at them whenever they happened to make eye contact with you. How is that not weird harassment? Women put up with guys trying to molest and rape them from childhood. My ex would have guys sit next to her on the train and start jerking off or fall on top of her and start groping her. Its literally a constant thing they have to put up with. 
So you, weird creeper, constantly making kissy faces at them rings alarm bells and makes them wonder if you are going to try and rape them later in the night. 
Idiot.
<comment>
light blonde has best fit
<comment>
If yu insisd
<comment>
I wasn't even the one who started the conversation
You were though. You started creepily smiling at them and staring at them on the dancefloor, probably while trying to get close to them and dance suggestively with them. 
I can already see youre engaging in denalism and cope. Alcohol lowered your inhibition and you acted like a creepy sexpest and got cold rejected, which sent you into a childish rage, didnt it. 
Yep, deny it. But deep down you know it happened that way.
<comment>
Whew, you're mad! Fucking HYSTERICAL! And if they didn't keep shooting me disgusted looks I wouldn't have responded. Also the bouncer didn't seem to care, so no harm no fowl. Also PLEASE FORGIVE ME for not getting on my hands and knees and BEGGING for forgiveness to them KWEEEENS for making them think I was going to rape them!
OH GOD PLEASE FORGIVE ME ANONYMOUS FROG BOARD POSTER AND GIVE ME DELIVERANCE FROM MY SINS!!
<comment>
3>4>>1>>5>>>>2
This is my final ranking.
<comment>
Whew lad...you picrel?

<comment>
the bouncer didn't seem to care, so no harm no fowl.
Yeah because your friend lied about the situation and covered for you, because he was in a rage about one of the girls rejecting his sexual advances. 
What kind of cognitive dissonance do you need to operate on to think you were in the right in this situation. 
God I hope you chemically castrate yourself, man. Before you end up in prison for rape/sexual assault.
<comment>
the sort of fuckface that enjoys muh club
And I rest my case
<comment>
1st one issa man
<comment>
Fucking based, fuck gynocentrism
<comment>
FORGIVE ME for not getting on my hands and knees and BEGGING for forgiveness to them KWEEEENS
Nobody asked you to beg. They asked you to just leave them the fuck alone and stop trying to smile at them and dance with them. You decided to try and ruin their night after that, along with your jilted friend who couldnt take being rejected by them. 
Maybe try developing an ounce of self-awareness.
<comment>
I went to a nightclub in Prague once and it was literally packed shoulder to shoulder so you couldn't even dance to the shit music even if you wanted to. Do people unironically enjoy that shit?
<comment>
i miss going out and running into redacted it was really weird and phonky B)
<comment>
No idea why I keep treading the same ground since you have this fuckin odd ass narrative you've concocted in your mind about the situation, but sure...I've got a few hours before I'm done work!
The play by play:
Buddy gets out on the dance floor
Other buddy gets on the dance
Looks like fun
I get on the dance floor
Grooving and having a good time
Girl keeps giving me weird looks
Smile and nod saying jack shit
She walks over to ME and says what was up further
I respond with that she's a boring cunt and dance away
Her and her friends kept shooting me shitty looks
So I shot some back
I do the same with dudes who get buttmad in cars. It seems the kissy face riles up pretty much anyone.
<comment>
Try going for women in your own league and you wont have these problems. Continue chasing after and harassing women that are far better looking than you are and you will continue to encounter these problems and likely face more severe ones in the future. 
You are probably a very average looking or below average looking guy with a weird personality and little charisma. You are clearly hypersensitive and super confrontational about it too which is also really tedious and offputting to everyone. 
Take my advice or dont, I know you probably wont. But honestly, your life wont get a modicum better until you do. 
Grow up.
<comment>
Do people unironically enjoy that shit?
Yeah but most of them are really high on hard drugs.
<comment>
He was minding his own business when some uppitty hobbit deemed that he was weird and decided to tell that to his face. Roasts were mad a sperg was enjoying himself outside of his home. They also tried to kick him out for not giving a fuck about their opinion. Women truly are npcs.
<comment>
Kek, I can hear the onions dripping from your sweat glands. It's such stereotypical insults it almost feels like bait, seems like you're projecting btw since you hate yourself and are jealous of low inhib people like the guy in that greentext. Nowhere did he say he was harassing them, much of the time insecure women will just try to bully low status men who are secure in themselves because they want emotional 'vengeance' and to pad their ego at their expense, sort of like you rn. Sadly you swung and missed though anon, I fuck mad bitches
<comment>
He retreats to samefagging and delusional, narcissistic cope. Let me guess, therapy is all Jewish subversion, right?
<comment>
Secure men dont react the way you did to women telling them theyre really weird, bud. A secure man would have just agreed with them and laughed and continued to dance like they didnt exist. 
You basically tripped over your own shoelaces before you were even out of the gate.
<comment>
Hardly. I could care less about "Same fagging" since (As I've stated multiple times) BEHOLD MY FIELD OF FUCKS! NOTICE HOW IT LIES BARREN AND EMPTY FOR YOUR OPINIONS ON THE MATTER!
<comment>
I'm not him dumbass. Also there's nothing wrong with trolling vindictive roasties. If someone is needlessly cruel and spiteful, they deserve to be mocked and made a fool of. You probably ignored bullies too because that's what you're 'supposed' to do. That's essentially what that roast was trying to do, bully someone they thought was an easy target. He turned it around on them in beautiful fashion and justice was served while they could only seethe, simple as
<comment>
Agree and continue on
"OMG YOU'RE SUCH A FAGGOT KEK MOOOOID! BE A MAN AND STAND UP FOR YOURSELF!"
Stand up for yourself
"OMG MOOOOID YOU'RE A RAPIST YOU TRAUMATIZED THOSE POOR WOMEN! YOU ARE WORSE THAN HITLER!"
Don't worry my dudes, you can't win against stupid.
<comment>
Yeah we can all Inspect Element, bud. Your typing style is identical and your double replying gives it away immediately. Consider suicide.
<comment>
pic rel
Also:
Consider suicide
Gotcha!
Considering...
And...Nah, I'm good
<comment>
correct answer definitely
<comment>
lmao get a load of this fucking guy
<comment>
what are you getting out of this lmao you're at minimum a tranny doing this or an actual woman because nobody else is this mentally ill
<comment>
She yells at me "You're really fuckin' weird"
Amazing how women can get away with this shit. Say this to another guy and there's a very real chance that you're getting into a physical fight. 
There's no discussion here. It's just that person trying to posture themselves and dominate you. So, men understand the only way out of that bullshit is to actually physically dominate the other dude who's trying to fuck with them.
<comment>
You are the architect of your own suffering. You just havent realized it yet. I hope you realize it before its too late to avert your ways, like I did.
<comment>
Translation: Men are so insecure that someone making a passing comment incites them to physical violence
You realize this is why so many men are emotionally stunted, cognitively crippled mantoddlers right? Because they spend their entire lives reacting to any and all criticism with extreme hostility and aggression. 
Thats how you end up with scenarios like grown men not knowing theyre walking around stinking like shit because you never wash your asshole properly. 
Or how most men have extremely obnoxious, unbearable personalities and mannerisms that make everyone not want to be around them. 
The loneliness epidemic among adult men today and the skyrocketing suicide rate is entirely self-fulfilling and earned.
<comment>
Insecurity is a bad thing retard. Everyone is insecure to some extent. The only people who expect men to never be insecure are women who are little more than overgrown little children. They idealize men and lust after a man that doesn't exist instead of coming to reality where even rich Chad is insecure about shit, in fact for a lot of successful men they are successful because they are insecure. I'm sick and tired of this label insecure being thrown around by immature women who refuse to let men be people with flaws. Yeah I'm insecure and so are you so shut the fuck up about it and let people have their issues they have to deal with instead of shaming men for having any sort of emotions. Kill yourself stupid hole
<comment>
Congratulations. You are finally on the first step to self-awareness.
<comment>
No.
However, number 1 and number 3 can come back to my place and watch me play factorio if they so desire, m'ladies.
The rest of you are not invited. Sorry.
<comment>
No retard, I'm at the last step to recognizing the shit tier society women have made this place and the awful expectations they continue to have for us. Feminists need to be shot in the streets because they are our greatest enemy. We can't have any sort of discussion about the genuinely unhealthy expectations women have of men because the conversation is constantly framed in a way to insult men and further shame them for any emotions they have. Kill yourself immediately.
<comment>
the genuinely unhealthy expectations women have of men
Yes. Because the reverse is not true at all either, is it.
<comment>
Go get raped by a BBD, foid. No man will ever love you the way you are.
<comment>
Hmm, a choice between SMC or BBC. Both guys will be the same obnoxious asshats. Difference is the black guy is at least physically appealing and takes care of himself and doesnt have a maggotdick. 
Sure is a tough choice.
<comment>
SMC is Small Maggot Cock, btw. White.
<comment>
Men don't have any unhealthy expectations of women, genuinely. Just take care of yourself and don't sleep with people outside of a committed relationship. That's literally it. "Don't be fat" might be the single most healthy expectation you can have of your partner possible. I mean it is literally about you being physically healthy.
<comment>
typical roastie is into racemixing
You deserve rape and also you speak like a redditor. I'd find you and stuff your pussy til you pass out if I knew your location.
<comment>
This is peak delusion.
<comment>
Okay whale enjoy your heart attack LOL
<comment>
This is peak whore.
<comment>
Ironic that you hate other races for being "lesser" but want to rape someone for disagreeing with you
<comment>
I'd find you and stuff your pussy til you pass out if I knew your location.
Yeah we now totally believe your version of events in that nightclub, bro. Look how easily the mask slipped. Retard.
<comment>
She yells at me "You're really fuckin' weird"
Laugh
Lean towards her
"Better to be weird and fun than a boring cunt"
Legit perfect response
<comment>
wake up
Originalium
<comment>
Women start shit
Get shit on in return
"WTF creep stop harrrassing women"
Kill yourself.
<comment>
I went to a club a single time in my entire life. It was a shit experience. 
Had to pay "door fee" because I was a dude going into the club
Even shouting it was impossible to understand the bar tender
Drink prices cost more then a small car
Dance floor was a sea of women on women. Not even dude bros could get into the mix
Ended up getting kicked out because I befriended some of the dude bros and we were horsing around grinding on one another imitating the women of the dance floor. From what I heard the club only lasted a year, closed down because people stopped going
<comment>
So I go and I stand on my own
And I leave on my own
And I go home and I cry and I want to die
<comment>
nog 
appealing
Only to you troony
<comment>
tfw got invited to the club by coworkers
everyone is dancing and having a good time
can't dance so just sit the whole night drinking
the club charge me like $200 for a bottle of cheap rum
It could have gone worse I guess. At least I didn't make a fool out of myself.
<comment>
How does one learn how to dance? Is it genetic? Is it something to do with melanin levels in an individual?
<comment>
idk but after that day I've considered taking dance classes but I'm to embarrassed to go to one
<comment>
They are all trannys, aren't they

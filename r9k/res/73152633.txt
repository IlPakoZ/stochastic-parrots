Anyone else find it sad how women even humiliate Chad? Shes obviously a lofty bitch and kept straining his neck and clearly hurting him without giving a fuck. But hes far too nice and polite to say anything. Even Chad gets taken advantage of and humiliated publicly by women. There is zero hope for non Chads.

What evil things are college students capable ?
She might get full ride cause i I know for some institutions that if ur grades/goa are high enough they just let u in. 
It ranks in top 10-15 schools in America 
He gets to fuck her and u dont
<comment>
she's not humiliating him. that's just you trying to cope

Yep. Women do micro manipulations like this to men constantly, I see it all the time in real life. It can be a really small thing, like calling him fag or bitch or gay in a joking way, borrowing his favorite hoodie or jacket and never giving it back to him, or like this girl, making him carry her around all day on his shoulders to the point its annoying and hurting his neck. 
It might seem like harmless playful fun but in reality its women shit testing men and seeing how far they can push them, if you get upset or mad, she thinks you are weak because she managed to hurt you. If you dont react and let her continue, she thinks you are a pussy because you dont set boundaries. You cant win in a situation like this, the only legitimate way to hurt a foids ego is to ignore her entirely. But she will likely still seethe and call you gay for that.

There are party kids and there are non party kids. The non party kids are in their rooms studying and didn't attend these events. My roommate went to these sorts of events practically every other night freshman year, I never went to one.
How are you people so retarded that you cannot automatically grasp that any institution will contain a variety of types of people
<comment>
yea dont listen to those coping roasties ITT, ur right. carrying a woman on your shoulders is pathetic. its literally elevating her above yourself and straining yourself for her comfort and amusement. absolute beta behavior, as cucked as eating pussy.
<comment>
Yet they get more pussy than you will ever see in your life considering you are on this board, nigger. So who is really the retard?

Pussy is meaningless and overrated. I dont envy normies and sex havers anymore after losing my virginity. Most overrated experience ever. And 100% not worth all the annoying shit that comes with women.

seriously, there are things that i will never understand. there is a new school shooting every weekend in the US, why the hell instead of killing innocent 6 yo children they don't kill people like this?

The whole world knows that American 'college life' just means constant bisexual orgies and beer along with living on campus in a room with others and its been like that for decades maybe centuries idk. It's promoted in movie and shows . 'College life' =/= actually learning a topic, not in the slightest, unless its a non American university that isn't distorted with American filth
<comment>
If you have self-respect, you can banter back and it's fine. To me it just sounds like you're an autist.
chick calls me a bitch
say "your mom's a bitch"
says "your dad's a bitch"
say "your dog's a bitch"
she says well yeah hehe heehee true xD
she now likes me more for bantering and not getting asshurt
You don't even have to be clever or anything, just banter and don't get upset, it's that easy. Women do this to check if you're secure in yourself and they won't fuck you if you fail the test.

Give the link already, nigger. I want to jerk off so hand it over

cant handle the bantz, many such cases!

For any anons whove gone to big schools, what is it like
I currently go to a decently big state school with around 30000 undergrads
Girls dominate the social caste system in any large state school. Men adapt to what they want to do. They align themselves into different factions , all of which passively hold the same goal of accumulating enough girls for them and their friends to fuck free of outsider competition.
If you are unable to get into any of these groups, your social life is pretty much stagnate until you are old enough to get into the bars/have a good enough fake ID. This is only a scenario for you if you want to drink a lot and have sex with girls while you are at school.
Long term relationships are harder to get the first two years, as many people just want to sleep around and let loose. They calm down around their third or fourth year. Kind of like a condensed version of the "roastie finally wants to settle down" meme. 
Academics are not difficult if you actually try and stay on top of things. The school leaves a decent sized safety net under you if you so happen to fuck up a single semester, because they want you to stay there longer and give them more of your money.
I feel like I have kind of a neckbeard take on this, but I also truly believe it is possible to have a good time at a school like this if you are a robot. Because of how large these places are, you are bound to find a group of kids you would want to be friends with. You can pretty much do whatever you want. The people that party every weekend are the most open about it and therefore make it appear like that is what everyone is doing.

yfw you thought ucla is elite
they literally accept anybody who can pay
<comment>
If a woman calls you a bitch or a fag, its 100% over already. She finds you pathetic. Do you think a woman trying to lock down a rich prince or a Hollywood actor would call him a bitch or a fag even jokingly? Banter with women means she has zero respect for you and sees you as a dorky brother. Not even accounting for the fact women are shit at banter and unfunny.
<comment>
I went to an actual Ivy League school. No we didnt have retards like this. This is a state school phenomenon only. Smart kids are generally highly introverted. We never had wild parties like they show in dumb movies.
<comment>
iwn be a cute overachieving high IQ asian girl partying it up as a gigastacy
anyways, most people i've met who went to "elite" schools were well adjusted extroverted normies
when you look at how you get in that's the kind of person they're looking for
besides grades consider what other shit people do to try to get into these schools
shitloads of extracurriculars, aka extroverted social shit
most common EC is a sport, so more extroverted social shit
look for leadership positions in clubs, aka being good at extroverted social shit

anything is easy with enough money.

Lol fuck you guys, carrying women is fun as fuck, if there's an element of humiliation to it it's worth it in this case. I gave one of my GFs piggy back rides all the time.

People who do shootings are insane. There is no logical thought process involved, they need psychiatric help, the real kind. Anyone capable of premeditating and thinking things through properly will just eventually realize they can dedicate that effort towards something else in life and be happy or escape the conditions that are causing them to think violent thoughts. 
For all intents and purposes, a mass shooting should be considered a force of nature.
<comment>
Undergraduate degrees don't matter. There is nothing exclusive about the undergraduate process or programs, its all cookie cutter all over the USA. What makes elite universities elite with regards to their academics, is their graduate students and research output. Rich people, which are mostly jews and chinks, are funneled into top schools because they are the most likely to continue donations to their alma matter. What these rich kids get out of it is associating themselves with the intellectual elite, because they attended the same institution as them.
Both sides are quasi-exploiting each other. You can't tell how smart someone is by what undergraduate institution they attended. You can absolutely make a judgement call based on what graduate institution they attended.
<comment>
chinks
donating
lmao you know a big reason why asians are discriminated against in admissions is because they're all frugal as fuck and won't donate back to the university.
<comment>
I've seen the opposite. They're discriminated against in graduate admissions because their TOEFL and GRE scores are usually fraudulent, and are completely useless once they're in. If they do not fly in for an interview there is zero chance their application will be considered any further, but again this is just my experience in the US. Anything else they do academically they've all but outright purchased through donations.

She looks hapa.
Depends on what you want to end up doing i.e. for CS all you need is a degree and internship experience.

True. I also apologize since I wasn't very clear in my post, I meant that the "prestige" from an undergraduate institution doesn't matter, as a student in Yale is obtaining the same quality of education as a student at another associated accredited institution in the northeast. Exceptional students that wish to do research can do it at most any university, and any professor is capable of assisting them, they don't have to work with a rockstar.
<comment>
This is true. Community college courses typically are more difficult than most non-honors equivalents at colleges because they have to be accepted by those colleges.
<comment>
Always found it funny how people on here chimp out about affirmative action 
Ivy Leagues (and most colleges) have always been bullshit and it's always been more about who you know and what extracurriculars you've done. It has very little to do with your own intellect. How do you think Trump got into Wharton? His daddy knew the admin very well.
<comment>
You can absolutely make a judgement call based on what graduate institution they attended.
This isn't true either. PhD programs are extremely connections-based. What matters most on a PhD application is 1) recommendation letters 2) diversity statement 3) research interest matches professor interest. Whether they need to pay your or not is probably up there too. Institution dependent ofc but recommendation letters are across the board probably the most important factor.
Undergraduate admissions are a complete crapshoot above a certain threshold. But genuinely smart people get in, along with diversity admits, athletes, and elites. They're not trying to filter out smart students they're picking other attributes over intelligence. Smart students still apply and top schools get their pick of the lot no matter how shitty they really are.
If you're talking specifically about international elite students the fraudulence and getting in via money and connections is true. But in general international students are higher quality than murican students in terms of academic achievement. Just in terms of the papers they publish and from personal experience talking to internationals.

quality of education
lmao you think people give a shit about that? And for research the school absolutely matters. Different schools specialize in different research and if you want to work in that field you need to go to a school where they actually have a department for it. And a top professor will boost your academic career much more than a normal one. Again, all about connections and status, nothing about quality. Unfortunately connections and status are extremely important.

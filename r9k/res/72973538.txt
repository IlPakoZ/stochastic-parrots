Post things ugly incels will never experience
A thoughtful original thread with shred of fun in it?
<comment>
yeah, this is what this thread is gonna be like
<comment>
kek
this girl has clearly halux valgus issues; she's objectiviely a 5 but because of her focussing on her deformed feed you can get her for the price of a 3.
incels are retarded
<comment>
Yeh I am too tired to care anymore, a friend just sent me a pic of him holding the girl I like but dont like me back's head in his lap. I can only imagine the squishing sounds they make while fucking. It's so fucking over I can't belive it's endless suffering from here on out, I hope I can change my brain and get over that bitch somehow, then I will be happy and free. It mostly hurts me just how good they have it, not how bad I have it. I wish they suffered aswell rather than feeling that good. But no, I am the only incel suffering in this world of chads having all the fun. I can't even begin to imagine how they feel like
<comment>
literally sharp knees wouldn't bang
You clearly suffer from faggotus maximus.
<comment>
the heartbreak gonna be crazy
<comment>
this makes me consider saving my virginity but eh. probably brain ruined from all the esex and porn
<comment>
are you implying men have a choice on the matter when they lose their virginity?
<comment>
no. only speaking personally. even i doubt i have much of a choice with this.
<comment>
You stop caring about virginity after the suffering gets too strong. 
be me
fuck it call a hooker
drive 30 mins, walk in her room dont even have to climb stairs
sucks my dick, get hard, climbs on my dick, cum
I still consider myself a virgin. I be masturbating so fucking much I dont even care if I pay for sex, nor try to make such a big deal out of it. I mean I am in a mental state that just dont give a fuck no more what's what.

how old is u

it's over
<comment>
who or what? the op girl is an average sloot
<comment>
How the fuck do you live together for three years and never have sex ? How the fuck do you live together with someone you've not already fucked ? This shit is total fantasy and I can smell the virginity of the guy who wrote that from here.

She'll be bouncing on BBC before he knows it

it happens between couples that are very young and both sort of awkward

girl op posted
10/10 to me
<comment>
 putting average and below women on a pedestal
She really is average ma dude. Also no ass, flat chest, awful hair etc
You would bang != good value
And the actually hot bitches you dont even talk to, dummy.
<comment>
i hav ex incel bf n he experiences this every day , mayb not with a girl tht prettyy but still
<comment>
Nobody can be this fucking naive and retarded.
I can't help but think these are two downies.
I'm in my 30s and I have never heard of a couple around me who where together for THREE years without sex, even living together.
That is abnormal, not that they'd want to stick together right afterwards.
<comment>
What did I do wrong bros. I tried my best, why does God punish me like this

I'm a Chad browsing a board for chuds

Sends tits without much work needed
I never even sent her a dick pic.

You don't get it, you are an authentic robot, one of the few left on this board.
You see a couple being intimate and loving and instead of being emotionally moved, your brain launches a program.

just posting this before i drift off to sleep
casual reminder that someone else was your future wife's first love
casual reminder that your future wife experienced teenage love with someone else
casual reminder that your future wife had a hoe phase and was an easy whore to strange men
and when she's a unwanted discarded old hag? it will be your turn!
<comment>
Not everything is about sex, anon. I wouldn't want to lose my virginity until I'm certain my boyfriend truly loves me and won't leave. I've never been in a relationship so I don't know how long that would be but it's worth waiting. It's better to be sure you'll be with that person forever.

Just make music. When you make music, you are alive. And girls always like the music boys.
<comment>
lol
cope harder my boi. im just telling you the truth
How the fuck do you live together for three years and never have sex ?
some pathetic nice guy cuckold who commands zero respect from females and dries up her cunt. you better believe she will eat out the ass of a man who she actually finds attractive, on the first day she meets him
<comment>
I wish i had the courage to castrate me self.
<comment>
I think if a gril actually wanted intercourer from
Me i would tell her to leave
<comment>
and when she's a unwanted discarded old hag? it will be your turn!
Who forces me to do that? I will never touch that roastie. Maybe hatefuck and piss in her mouth to show dominance.
<comment>
dont worry about it champ, when you get to a certain point you start simping for these used up roasties and telling others that you dont care about the past or looks, and that older more experienced women are based, and teenage love and youth are overated
lol
<comment>
Dear friend, she has a halux valgus. these are deformed feet. her knees are prob. totally fine.
also, this is just incel shit talking about an mid- to below average bitch who is setting up a show - either for shekels or for the keks.
all i am doing is, that i remind you that she is really a normi girl and a realistic and doable voal for most of you guy. no need for incel rage.

Man, you've got some weapon grade autism. You take memes literally and completely misread intentions. Get on autismbux if you're not on them already, it would be a waste to miss out.

cute gf meeting you at the airport

A couple months and the girl will be sucking and fucking another guy.
<comment>
Paid for this just 2 days ago. Say what you want it still felt awesome. She was also cuter than both my crush and the girl in your vid

Your woman holding your baby

Is this how virgins cope nowadays?
<comment>
a series I saved
<comment>
which goes on
<comment>
What future wife? Incels don't and won't have gfs, the only women they ever talk to are usually cashiers and you're talking about wives?
<comment>
painfully goes on
<comment>
you must be young then. raw sex is barely a sustenance. pure, innocent, and long-lasting true love is what is most important and valuable in this corrupt, evil, and vapid world
you will feel the pain of not having it when you grow older and mature more
<comment>
and he's so casual and blase
<comment>
but has actual hope and advice in it I guess
<comment>
It's just a creative writing exercise. Why do you let it bother you?
<comment>
It is oddly painful and hopeful to read, like looking through a toy store window when you have no money
<comment>
I need every cope I can or else I'm dead
<comment>
Maybe. Life sucks either way, of anything I will use the pain of not being loved as a cure for any other thought that stresses me out (like fear, cancer, someone dying, working, lack of success etc)
<comment>
NTA, but I know chads like in those stories.
They exist.
<comment>
OP asks, I deliver
<comment>
How the fuck do you live together for three years and never have sex ?
I bet she got fucked plenty of times, just not by the dude.
The sexless relationship is probably because he's as interesting as watching paint dry, but must have some money, so she's working towards a future profitable divorce.
<comment>
Why do men care so much about relationships, romantic love and sex? Just focus on all the other fun, creative and meaningful things in life. Im a 24yo virgin and my depression never stemmed from something as trivial. Is it like a burger thing specifically? Do you not have real problems in life?
<comment>
I had an uncle told me (6'5, blue as fuck eyes) that when he was young and jacked he used to just walk shirtless on the beach and women would flock up to him like pigeons for bread, touching him and getting to know him, multiple at a time. It's why I started lifting, he told me I am a skinny fuck, I eventually got ripped but still zero pussy. He also told me he had access to women as women do to men. He could choose any bitch to fuck with no problem he said. Being chad is something else lmao, also ages you gratefully, bro smokes 5 packs of marlboro reds all his life and is still perfectly healthy now at 60
<comment>
Which is just the saddest part
Have an extremely deep emotional connection with the person you lost your virginity to
Social media and other women convince you that you are missing out by not having sex with random men you do not care about
Cheat or break up to have meaningless sex with men who just want to use you
Realize you ruined your only chance at happiness
<comment>
No they/we don't. I have all the free time in the world, I have like 5 milion dollars networth of land and houses and cars inherited, only 200k in my bank account. I sit all say and have everything in life except sex/a girlfriend. I am sure people with free time like me feel the same way. I fuck hookers now and then but I still spend all my nights alone. I can't constantly think 
oh well my teeth are not hurting at least. remember when I broke my foot yeah that hurt or when I burned my finger. haha yeah for sure them starving bitches have it worse than my girlfriendless ass.
It's suffering to always have this mindset of oh well at least I am not in hell. If anything that is not how you remove want from life. I used to work a job I hated for like 3 months and yeah that suffering did outweight not having a gf but now I dont work so nothing outweights the pain in my poor heart
<comment>
Find a passion, hobby, travel, get friends, party, enjoy LIFE, DUDE. Men are fucking dumb lmfao. You bring this feeling upon yourself and waste time romanticizing the least crucial part of life instead of enjoying what you are already capable of achieving and experiencing. 
I know what you wrote is bullshit, but if it was true, you WOULD find a girl already with that amount of time, money and motivation to do so.
<comment>
I sit all day
HMMMM
<comment>
I have an uncle like that. Tall, strong, deep radio announcer voice. He pulled the entire deal
fucked a ton in HS and university
Met a deeply religious virgin, married her
had a huge family
His sons stride the earth like demigods, women following them around like they have been cursed to lust after them
<comment>
mfw i see this thread for the 3rd time in a week
<comment>
Have yet to hear her full story
<comment>
No tell me anon I live for the drama
<comment>
i wonder if the anon who makes these is an ugly incel. hmm

Tranny suicide cult trying to demoralize incels on here

i wonder how those 2 old guys feel
<comment>
This doesn't work if you're a subby bitch like me, I'd want the girl to take charge
<comment>
You will never live in the best country in the world
<comment>
This is very obviously a fantasy written by some autist who has never been with a woman
<comment>
What kind of friend would do that? Does he know you like her?
<comment>
I'm 33y old virgin and I must say this almost makes me sad, almost. Good for them I guess, they virgin maxed and it paid off. Maybe they can survive the honeymoon phase since they lived together for 3 years already. So it's not like suddenly they will start noticing annoying stuff about each other. But one of them, probably her might get a stupid idea about "missing out" on "fun" and "experience" with others. Oh well. 
casual reminder that someone else was your future wife's first love
casual reminder that your future wife experienced teenage love with someone else
casual reminder that your future wife had a hoe phase and was an easy whore to strange men
The sad, cold reality for 99.9% for men who will accept used goods.

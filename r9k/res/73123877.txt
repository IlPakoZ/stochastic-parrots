Remember, that Chad gets to do this every day. 
How do you cope, anon?
most men only get sex 1-2 times a week, most men have sex with 4-6/10 women
how do cope
I think of how much of a loser I am and always been and a relief of pity and relaxation hormones of "it's so fucking over" washes over me, and it makes me all warm inside also aswell when they laugh at me and think "look at that loser. he will never see a vagina" and the girl raises her head laughing out loud. These are my copes.
most men only get sex 0 times a week.*
try putting a fleshlight and a container of lube in a pot of water and bring it to a near simmer then talk to me
by being glad that is not me

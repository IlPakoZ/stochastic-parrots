Sitting alone in a dock and drinking whiskey. Very comfy. How are you doing there, anons?
<comment>
Seems sad and pathetic.
It's not poetic your just a sad loser
<comment>
I'm doing alright. A bit sad that the person I wanted to talk to hasn't been on for a couple of days now. Is that fresh, salt or brackish water under the dock, OP?
<comment>
Fucking normie. Do i need a friend or a gf to enjoy myself? Normies really cant enjoy themselves when theyre alone, pathetic
<comment>
I hope that you get to hang out or talk to that person soon, anon. Its a river and its not that clean. So i guess brackish water.
<comment>
I don't have my hopes up too high for that. Have you ever fished before, OP? It's quite nice and if the water is clean(no industrial/pesticide/herbicide pollutants) then it's a nice way to save money and enjoy your day.
<comment>
How is that sad and pathetic? You seem like a faggot that can't breathe without the affirmation of other people
<comment>
I have once. It was kind of fun, since i was with my dad and siblings. I live alone now. But theres always someone fishing here. Sometimes i ask them if theyve caught anything or whatever. Anything good happen to you lately, anon?
<comment>
Thank you! Fucking normies invading this board, man
<comment>
and drinking whiskey.
what kind? I like nice whiskey but I save that for special occasions, when I just want to get blasted I drink cheaper crap.
<comment>
Sounds like a pleasant memory and I fully understand you. I always fished alone when I could, fishing around someone else just comes off as uncomfortable. I've been having some good things happening with the plants and animals I keep cultures of. My pennywort plant that wasn't growing for a while has suddenly shot up a nice, tall stem and its leaf on that stem is bigger than the one that came before it(a sign that it wasn't getting enough nitrogen). Pic related are a kind of pennywort, they're amphibious plants in that they can do well in both land and water, although they prefer wetlands.
It's not even summer yet, which is the startling thing.
<comment>
This one. Got it from my dad. But i think it got stale because the cap kind of broke and cant seal that tight anymore. Kind of tastes like yeast now. But i still enjoyed it, im trying to stay away from expensive whiskey now since im trying to save money. What kind of whiskey do you enjoy, anon
<comment>
Aw hell yeah! Having a plant survive when you think it dies is a good good feeling. If you dont mind me asking, whats the good happenings related to animals, anon?
<comment>
It really is nice. I've got a prickly pear pad that I planted in some sand that's gotten tons of roots now and is making another pad too. For animals though it'd the little bladder snails that I have, they've been doing really well after they had a big die off when the aquarium heater just roasted them. Somehow an egg clump survived(I think it's because the air in the aquarium was too hot as a lot of them died above the water and none seemed to be in it, but my fish was absolutely fine and the water itself was lukewarm at most) and hatched and those initial babies have become sizeable just like their parents and started adopting their old tricks. A few of them love to crawl upside down on the surface of the water and they've been eating all of my mini-duckweed by getting a bunch of it to clump to them when they're at the water's edge and then pulling it up out of the water and sticking it to the glass. Other than that my scuds seem to be doing and my isopods are doing well. I've been thinking about collecting new stuff out in the wild too.
Do you garden, OP?
<comment>
I haven't had many Japanese ones, though I hear some are very nice, but I've had a bunch of Scotch. I like the ones from the islands, the peaty, smoky, peppery ones. Talisker is really good.
I'm a burger so I've been to Kentucky and had a bunch of bourbon. there's some really good ones but for that I prefer rye when I can get it. What else have you tried/liked anon?
<comment>
That sounds nice, anon. I searched bladder snails, and some pics have them on water, some on land. Are they land animals or water? No, but my grandma and mom does some gardening. My mom just does it for the aesthetic while my grandma does it for food, like basil and stuff. I really like looking at them plant and stuff. Your hobbies sound so nice, anon. I dont mind listening about them even if i dont have much knowledge about them. You sound like a guy with many hobbies, do you play any instruments?
<comment>
Oh, you like smoky ones? Manly tastes. I like them sweet. Most of what ive tried is japanese, since thats what my dad likes. Hibiki, very sweet and floral. Hakushu, my favorite, a bit smoky and woody taste. Nikka, floral as well, really nice. Ive tried some common whiskey as well like Monkey shoulder, Johnnie walker, and Makers mark. I avoid bourbon and rum since they give me headaches. Wine is the worst for headaches. What whiskey do you recommend me, anon?
<comment>
Bladder snails are pretty much amphibious too. They can survive on land for a while, but they're really prone to drying up and iirc they have both gills and lungs. Mystery snails are like bigger versions of them, they also tend to lay their eggs out of the water. People actually have bred mystery snails to have all kinds of shell colors too. This video is a great video on them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDQ1uI3Nox8 [Embed] it even shows their siphons that they use to breath air. I definitely have too many hobbies (^':, not instrument playing though. My hobbies tend to be more STEM oriented, although I have wanted to learn how to play some.
<comment>
Im guessing you have a microscope at home. That, or you would really love one at home. Im a med tech, im a kind of used to handling microscopes and you see real interesting things in all sorts of things that are rich in organisms. Btw, i play a bit of piano. Really fun to learn but became afraid of it due to pressure from myself. Gotta start learning it again
<comment>
I would really like one, I'm actually pretty interested in medicine too. I don't really have any money for any of that stuff though, so I make due with what I can get. I do enjoy seeing content about microorganisms though, like from Journey To The Microcosmos, Close Intell &amp; Jam &amp; Germs(which is now Jam's Germs it seems). The piano is a wonderful instrument, it definitely earns admiration once you're good at it. Are you still in school or did you graduate?
<comment>
Im in 4th year college for med tech. So, im an intern now. The medical field is interesting but its full of competitive normies and are toxic af, thats the downside. And ofcourse the cost. How about you, anon?
<comment>
Microorganisms are really interesting. We have a subject about it but is focused on only the clinical aspect. So, we only learn whats necessary. But man, is it fun to look at them move around, watching them in a microscope
<comment>
That does sound like a pain. I'm a middle school dropout, so I have no real future for any of this stuff. I don't do well around other people either, sets me on edge.
I can imagine, yeah. As far as clinical aspects go I think there's still plenty that could be looked into with potential future pathogens. I've had this idea about Candida auris is in a position to evolve and adapt behaviors to become a sexually transmissible and behavior altering form.
<comment>
Also, wrong species. I meant C. albicans, not auris. The idea involves host/endosymbiont relations and how endosymbionts and endoparasites overlap and change over time.
<comment>
Candida auris isnt as clinically significant as Candida albicans since C. auris is said to be more opportunistic for people with weaker immune systems. How do you know all this stuff, anon? You sound like a real smarty pants, cause i learned all this shit in my college. Maybe you should invest in yourself? Idk, easier said than done. But you sound like one smart motherfucker
<comment>
Ohh, well then youre right. Didnt see this reply when i replied. We see people with yeast infections just by scraping their infected skin and placing a KOH solution. Itll look kinda like this
<comment>
In this case, its sputum. Itll still look similar, i think. Im still new to this
<comment>
Well, among Scotch the Speyside whiskies are usually lighter and sweeter. If you like something sweet and smooth you might try Glenfiddich, that's pretty widely available, usually the 12-year. It's really smooth and almost maple-y. at least to my tongue, I'm hardly an expert taster. 
Glenmorangie has some nice ones, too, you're less likely to find that in a bar but a liquor store that carries Japanese whiskies should have some. The "plain" 10yo is pretty good, the 12yo is a sweet sherry kind of thing, but the 14yo ("Quinta Ruban") I think you might like. They sell a tasting set with mini bottles of those, that's how I tried them, see if you can find that. 
and yeah, I drink the stuff that my mom can't even stand the smell of. Laphroaig is the big name in the ones that taste (according to her) like medicine and iodine, you can find that at a lot of liquor stores, at least here in burgerland. I have a bottle of Kilchoman, and I kid you not it smells and tastes like smoke. I think that's mighty appealing, but I see how it'd be an acquired taste.
<comment>
Yeah, got my names mixed up for stuff. I think it's a bit too late to really invest in myself and I don't really have the money for all of that. I'm 26, no job, been a NEET for a long time, etc.. All of this stuff just interests me so I learn about it, biology itself is my main autistic interest(and I do mean that literally, I was diagnosed as a kid unlike a lot of the people I've seen claim to be autistic on this board).
But you sound like one smart motherfucker
Thank you, fren.
See the hyphae are really what concerns me with C. albicans. The fact that they can switch between that unicellular form and forming networks makes them all too liable for our future health. There's some other really disturbing shit with C. albicans too, see: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-fungi-brain-infection-impair-memory.html
A completely separate group of fungi, but ones that are exceedingly disturbing would be the entomophtora(insect destroyers) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomophthora_muscae . They're a behavior hijacking parasitic fungus that actively begin migrating to parts of their hosts' brains to influence them to get to where they want them to be to spread their spores. The ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is all too spooky and it's at least good that our immune systems are far more complex than arthropodal ones and that we're warm blooded and thus better able to fight infections -- but I worry that as humans become more prevalent the niche to infect and behaviorally hijack humans is just too large and too resource rich to not be exploited.
<comment>
I like the Glengiddich, while my dad likes the Glenmorangie. Good suggestions. The 14 yo one sounds expensive. Ive heard of Laphroaig as being smoky as fuck. Literal smoke. Im a coffee lover too. Ive tried liberica, a specie of cofea mostly found in the Philippines. Tastes like fucking smoke. I didnt like it, but i think you would love that, anon. I like fruity and floral notes for both coffee and whiskey
<comment>
Arent most yeast or fungi that are clinically significant capable of forming hyphae? Saw the link, i think it concerns to people with really weak or compromised immune systems like people with HIV and shit. But that was interesting, i underestimated C. albicans. Didnt know they could reach the fucking brain. Anon, do you know about super bugs? And how bacteriophages, a virus, is being researched to counteract this problem?
<comment>
if I remember right the Glenmorangie 14y wasn't as expensive as you might think for something that old. Granted, Scotch is rather expensive in the first place, but I've seen it at the grocery store near me. If you can afford Maker's Mark bourbon (which is very nice bourbon, I should say, I got to visit their distillery once) then you can afford Glenmorangine, even the 14y. IIRC I saw the 10y for $40. 
I'll make a note of that liberica, sounds intriguing.
<comment>
Thanks! Ill try the 14yo glenmorangie if i ever see it in a bar. Where do you live, anon? Liberica is the most accessible in the Philippines and probably Southeast asia. If youre in north america, they may overprice it. Be careful
<comment>
Most fungi produce hyphae, yeah. Although many kinds of hyphae and mycelium forming fungi don't have a unicellular stage beyond just being a spore and if it's a spore then it doesn't make more of itself in that state, like how yeast can with budding. Hyphae themselves are risky investments in something like the body where things are shifting around a lot, they can potentially break and if you're in the intestines then if you can't produce a holdfast then you'll likely be totally swept out of the intestines. Hyphae themselves are useful in non-mobile or limitedly mobile parts of the body and additionally in directly interacting with/hijacking cells from the host. Some Ophiocordyceps fungi are known to be able to do this with muscle cells and from what I remember they shortly destroy the muscle cells after manipulating them, which is seen as a means of preventing the host from undoing the locking of the insect's jaws on the leaf they've gotten to. Pic related shows muscle cells and fungal hyphae in this relationship.
Also that relation of it only being a problem for the immune compromised is something that can change. Immune compromised individuals could be seen as an evolutionary gate for pathogens like this. I view it like a gradient, the immune compromised have very little immune presence/response but it still exists and thus there is still selective pressures for evading/countering the immune system and also they're exploiting new resources which selects in favor more for exploiting that new niche. You'd expect that if something like that were able to spread that it'd spread mostly amongst people who're immuno-compromised and then it would progressively infect healthier and healthier individuals. It kind of weirdly makes HIV and some pathogens like AAVs and adenoviruses.
<comment>
yeah, I'm a Burger, and in midwest flyover country no less. (hence why I got to visit distilleries in Kentucky) I have no idea what prices and availability might be like elsewhere in the world.
<comment>
That sounds nice! You get your whiskey from your local distillery. I only get to get imported ones, my country only produces rum that is of good quality. Which gives me a bad hangover and is too sweet for me. Ive never tried kentucky whiskey, ate they generally smoky. Im not much for very smoky ones, just a lil is ok.
<comment>
Are they generally smoky?* typo
<comment>
Not doing so hot the isolation gets to me. I got no friends and my depression and anxiety are getting pretty bad. Maybe I should take as much drugs as i can snd go out with a bang
<comment>
Hmm, i think HIV is a different case. Not sure, since i dont know much about fungi infections, since bacteria and viruses are usually more of a threat. HIV targets the t helper cells, which is kind of the center of the specialized immune system regarding lymphocytes. Mf fucks up the professional immune cells, not just some rando somatic cell. Fungi are more of a threat to little organisms like bugs and such. But, this is coming from a medical fag. All we know is clinical, not really the whole biology of the fungus. But dont underestimate our immune system, theyre pretty fucking awesome. Well, unless the pathogen has a specialty on targeting them. Like HIV
<comment>
Yeah, it usually fucks me up too, anon. I was hurting too. I ran a bit. Then, drank some whiskey. And then, luckily, some nice anons replied to my thread. Im a bit more happy because of that. Feel free to stay and talk with us, anon. Youre more than welcome
<comment>
I haven't had much rum, what I have had is pretty sweet for my tastes too. Maybe I just haven't had really good rum? I know I've never had the Don Papa you posted. Kentucky bourbon whisky is kinda slightly sweet, though some of them have a bit of a tang to them. I usually drink my whiskey straight but there's no shame in putting an ice cube in your glass, just a bit of water from melting ice cuts it noticeably. (well, I notice it. pretty much everything about tasting drinks it subjective)
What other kind of stuff you have over out there in the Philippines? More kinds of rum? something else?
<comment>
Plus, viruses and bacteria are known to evolve faster as well
<comment>
Thats the only one i know. Were not that known for whiskey or any alcohol production. Atleast, not that i know of. However, our coffee culture is growing. Maybe i should try some kentucky alcohol next time. I drink them straight as well. Its hot in the Philippines, so the ice melts faster. And i dont like diluting my whiskey. You sound like you know your stuff, anon. I bet you use a glencairn glass. I love this glass, but my dad prefers the wider mouth glass since it looks more manly
<comment>
I mean I do know that HIV does impair our ability to fight some fungi, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidioidomycosis being an example where people infected with HIV who develop it tend to not make it through it. Personally I don't think we have anything to worry about in the immediate future but I do see it being a potential problem for the future and also an area to research and see if any kinds of our microbes in our microbiomes are developing odd genes in certain communities. Namely I'd say that it's best to look into highly promiscuous communities(think gay bars, nightclubs, etc.) and see if strains of certain microbes from individuals there have unique differences compared to microbes from individuals divorced from those environments/populations.
Yeah, although you shouldn't underestimate how fast even asexual, eukaryotic cells can evolve. We do have plenty of examples of cancerous cells evolving into their own infectious diseases, we've even witnessed it in the modern era with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease . The thing with eukaryotes that's great is that we our evolution is more flexible, for lack of a better word, as our gene expression is more malleable.
<comment>
Wth, theres a cancer thats infectious? Sounds like fucking hell on earth wtf. Learned something new today
<comment>
Christ, i hope that doesnt reach to humans. We have enough fucking diseases already. And frankly, i dont want to study all that
<comment>
Yup, it's happened a few times in nature already. Dogs have their own kind too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_transmissible_venereal_tumor . Cancer can be viewed, evolutionarily, as its own single-celled organism for modelling how it might change or what it's likely to do. These kinds of transmissible cancer though only usually occur in genetically bottlenecked(I.E. low genetic diversity) communities, like with the first domesticated dogs and Tasmanian devils.
<comment>
Ohhh hell nahhh. Cancer is scary enough already, spontaneously mutating inside you like a fucking bomb. Now we gotta worry about it potentially being contagious? The world is a scary place, anon
<comment>
No need to worry for that, we're very genetically diverse and we tend to be pretty good about staying clean/treating our sick. Honestly bio-engineered diseases would be way more worrying and you wouldn't have to limit them to just bacteria, viruses and so on. With enough money you can bio-engineer even plants to be horrid things (^^^^:
It's all Daijobu, anon.

Thats comforting to hear>>73150932
<comment>
I'm high as fuck and I just hate everything but the most i hate is me. I resent myself for not being able to find friends or hold on to friends. Hate being a neet and just wanna stop it all
<comment>
Anon, heres a cope strategy ive been telling myself, maybe it would be of use to you
Friends are normie propaganda. Always being around someone for constant validation is what normies need. They judge us for being alone, but theyre just as pathetic
Its a bit of an exaggeration. We are humans, we do have our social needs. But dont beat yourself up when you cant make any friends now.
<comment>
I think it's a combination of shitty luck. Family asking me when i will marry why I'm always home and can't find a job. God i died a million deaths when i told my mom that I'm back on meds just that disappointed look killed me. Grandma is forgetting more and more and both she and grandpa are sick and can barley walk . I just try to drown everything out with drugs and alcohol
<comment>
Okay, that sounds really bad. Seeing a person with dementia is just depressing as fuck. Ive seen it with my grandpa as well when i was a teenager. It hurt when he couldnt remember me. I hope you see the light in the future, anon. I wish you luck and happiness
<comment>
So.. what kind of alcohol are you consuming? Im curious
<comment>
Vodka i only drink vodka shots>>73151116
i think i should stop with the drugs and get my live together I'm just scared of people and drugs are the only thing keeping me somewhat normal
<comment>
Smart, less hangovers. It is scary, anon. I really suggest to stay away. Ive tried having a dependency for a short time, it really fucked me up. Like, i believed that i cant be happy or function without it. I even screamed at the normies to shut the fuck up and unironically called them normies irl. Dont overdo it like i did.
<comment>
You seem like a faggot that can't breathe without the affirmation of other people
He posts in a thread made by a guy who can't even sit by the ocean and drink whiskey without seeking affirmation from a board full of virgins
<comment>
I'm addicting to lyrica but only because of my anxiety i take them legally it helps a ton. Just shitty that i have to take meds for my bpd (not a classic bpd i funktion normal because of years of therapy)
<comment>
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

<comment>
lol, thanks. I pretend to know my stuff at least. I do have one of those glasses, I bought it in the gift shop of one of those distilleries. I remember on the tour they told us about how it was supposed to expose just enough of the liquor to the air to let you smell it properly, or something like that. My nose cant pick a difference between that and an ordinary tumbler. But you're right, it sure looks swish.
also, you want hot? Years ago I visited Death Valley national park. Famous as one of the hottest places on earth. In late August. it was in the mid-120s (F) the whole time. I bought a beer from a shop at Furnace Creek where the vistor's center is, and it was warm inside of 60 seconds - and it didn't sweat, no condensation at all, because it was so dry that it evaporated before it could form. (you didn't notice yourself sweating either, it was strange)
<comment>
Now I'm just gon' sit, at the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh yeah
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
<comment>
Oh damn, youve been there. Being in the Philippines, dont wanna be in the hot at all since thats all we get here. Its especially nowadays
<comment>
Borderline or bipolar? I dont know which bpd is. If its ok to ask, what are the specific struggles having bpd and all?
<comment>
Nice tunes. That wouldve been perfect for listening when i was sitting on the dock. But im in my room now
<comment>
Oh i mean borderline hah. Abandonment issues just outbursts of anger and love stuff like that but I'm on meds and have it controlled when it happens. I was seriously tormenting my family and at pne point when i was 18 i cut myself. Depressing to the point of multiple Suizid attempts and as i said at 18 i said stop i can't keep living like this destroying myself and other went into a clinic far away because of alcohol problems. Since then I'm in therapy and living a normal life (I'm 24 now)
<comment>
Im glad for you, anon, living a normal life now. That mustve taken hard work and stuff, cause im having a hard time at life and im probably neurotypical. I just have a neurotic personality
<comment>
Yea it was a long way and i still have lots to learn like trusting people
<comment>
Good night, anons. I had a lot of fun talking to you. Honestly, I had a bad day and had an anxiety attack during duty hours. Hence, the drinking on the dock. You truly made my night better. I hope you guys have a good day
<comment>
What a nice little slug. Have a good night, anon.

I borrowed and took home my moms oculus quest 2 it's insane. It's fucking blowing my mind. I'm having so much fun just watching 360 music vids and shit i haven't even tried a game yet 
mfw I put them on for the first time

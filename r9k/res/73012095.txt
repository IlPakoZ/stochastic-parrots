Fellow femanons. When did you get over your 'white guys can still a viable option' phase? And what caused it?
yawn zzzzz
im gonna use white guys as my safety net desu, most of them are very simpy i think. good financial and emotional bf material, they are also really easy to emotionally manipulate lol. 
gaslight, gatekeeper, girlboss. thats my plan.
Yeah I thought that too. But honestly now I don't think I could even force myself to pretend to be barely interested in a white guy even if he was a billionaire complete simp zombie who did everything I commanded. 
I can make tens of millions in a single year on OnlyFans anyway and from online simps. I never need to actually get anywhere near white guy physically irl to bleed him dry.
Never left it. Pic related is a myth, "Big" black pepees don't exist. Even if they did I wouldn't touch one with a ten foot pole.

why does OP never answers if he gets paid to post this garbage daily or if he's doing it for free in his free time?
the key is to be hypersexual before marriage so he proposes, then after the wedding night you can pretty much stop having sex altogether. and he will be too scared to divorce or confront you because he loses half his shit.

I think something is wrong with me. Like I think I'm actually having some kind of weird breakdown or panic attack, but I don't know who to call or what to do about it. I'm scared that if I tell anyone what's wrong with me I might be institutionalized or even laughed at. I don't even know how to explain the situation. I don't even know why I'm making this thread.
Fuck I want to die man.
mindfulness meditation is nice
youtube it - there are even 1minute videos, but a 5 or 10min may be better
you can still have your problems after the meditation, but its a break
This isn't working, but I appreciate the advice though. Thank you.
No one to call just lay in bed stare at your ceiling and count sheep. Nothing is happening to you, you are fine and it will pass.
Well that's the thing that's fucking crazy. I don't know how else to explain it without sounding like a literal schizo.
I WANT something to happen to me. I want some danger or excitement in my life, and I think I'm starting to panic because that makes me sound like a psychopath. Like I want people to suffer and get hurt so I can live out my own fantasies.
I'm also panicking because I'm scared that I'm just going to stagnate, and all of these people that faced hardship will get to live on and tell their stories, while I die in my room like a fucking loser. I will ltiterally never be happy in my entire life, ever. That sounds fucking deranged, but I don't know what to do.
Go join a boxing gym then, I just meant for the immediate panic you have to just sit through it.
if you have alternating periods of extreme despair/depression and positivity/feelings of being highly capable (but not necessarily happiness/contentment), its possible you're bipolar.
Lots of meds easily treat bipolar now.

What's it like having a foreigner girlfriend?
Do you get to eat new delicious dishes and interact with their culture?
<comment>
Depends on the culture. Mine is Russian and we eat basically just normal American food. Chicken and oatmeal and stuff. Everything else is just like rural America.
If you date some gook, it could be some extreme cultural shift.

Constant misunderstandings. Frustration. Inability to understand one anothers humor.

normie here, I've only dated foreign women because American women are cancer
I dated a French-Canadian and a Vietnamese and yes they were both god tier cooks and visiting rural Quebec was awesome

eating new delicious dishes and interacting with their culture
reality
I live in fear she gets deported if she fails her university exams and loses her student visa. I constantly have to hear how her relatives are doing back in her shithole country, without being able to help them

Where's she from and why are you continuing to date such a brainlet?

Two types of foreign people in general, not just girls:
1. Excited to be here, wants to try your culture instead, may be confused but is more than happy to have you explained. Will talk for hours about the funny differences between the two. Usually ends up living a life where the two mix, often to comedic effect, would happily stay here instead of going back, feels national pride even though not born here because recognises this new place is just objectively better. Get's called uncle toms and coconuts by people from group 2 below.
2. Gets culture shocked so hard they regress back into their old ways. Refuses to learn the new culture, sticks to theirs almost religiously, hates almost anything from the new culture, is low-key racist, refuses to date anyone from the new culture, refuses to let their children date anyone from their new culture, forms or joins a small part of town that's just full of foreigners from their country (little china e.g.), never learns the language and/or accent, really is only here to make money to send back home and plans to go back when richer.
proof: I am immigrant to UK for 14 years. While I don't love or understand everything about UK culture, I at least don't hate it and am willing to even try it. Their food is not that bad, I like rock music and the tea is delicious, I drink it everyday. Recently I've been taking accent classes online so i can get rid of my old one, not out of hatred of it, but it just makes communicating with others easier. You have no idea how annoying it is having to repeat yourself constantly because your accent is so thicc no one can understand you
Meanwhile, my mum, is number 2.

My gf is from Ghana, she cooks really good chicken and her family is super nice to me. She was also a virgin before me and wants to have at least 3 kids.
<comment>
Damn you're a lucky man guess this place isn't for incels anymore
<comment>
I met her on OkCupid. My profile straight up said I only want to date virgins and despite everyone online saying that's a horrible idea and will be a red flag even to virgin women it turned out to be fine. My advice is to just to put yourself out there honestly and don't settle. Very cliche I know but it's true. Whetever you find a partner is all up to luck anyways so it's best to just keep trying and not worrying about it too much.

My Russian wife is a nightmare to live with. They've got basically no culture worth exploring.

I think having a gf from a different background is better. My family are Mexican and my r9k bf is normally shy and we went out a lot and hes also a picky eater and I forced him to eat lots of cool food which his mom thought was great. Im going to have to force him to try lots of new foods when he comes to stay with my abuela next month too!!

Are you the tranny that posted pics of you and your bf holding hands?

Nobody's gonna believe me, but I met my Korean gf on Reddit (r/r4r to be exact). She saw my post and messaged me, telling me that she was sick of dating Korean men; I could relate, since I'm fed up with dating American women. I'm the first White guy she's dated (she's dated a two Koreans and one Chinese-American before me). My gf cooks very well (even though the mandatory kimchi at every meal gets really old really fast), is very feminine, has an amazing body, and has never turned down sex. She actually looks pretty similar to the woman in the thumbnail, but my gf has bigger boobs, wider hips, and wears glasses. A lot of Koreans (including my gf) speak English damn-near flawlessly, so there's no language barrier. Dating a foreign woman honestly feels like a cheat code. 
When we went over to Korea to visit her family, we went to Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul, and we rented hanbok (traditional Korean clothing). It was a lot of fun, honestly. 
I really couldn't care less if people say I have "yellow fever," or whatever. I'll take my 8.5/10 Korean gf over a ran-through White chick any day of the week. The only real "downsides" are that I'm sick of eating kimchi and she sometimes forces me to watch stupid Korean dramas idgaf about. A small price to pay though, all things considered.

Shes from the next country over but yeah, their food &amp; cooking is a lot nicer than ours.
<comment>
Im also going to force him to try my cock teehee
<comment>
Dude I met this HOT foreign girl and she's super into me for no reason at all! Things will go GREAT forever! 
Yeah, wait until you get married. Then the real hell begins.

I live in Japan and been trying to date Japanese girls for months now. It's impossible. They're flaky, crazy, irrational, ghost and block on a whim. Almost makes me miss Americans, almost. Some know how to cook really well but most young girls wanna sit on their ass all day and watch jdrama/kdrama. And make tiktoks.
Idk, not looking great

Kgf is the best. My fiancee is Korean. I actually enjoy Korean food and media so I dont mind that she wants it constantly. Also very traditional and family oriented. She has a PhD and is a scientist yet still wants to have tons of kids and be a stay at home mom.

My girlfriend is vietnamese
I used to be a no-vegetable picky eater who ate bland foods. Now I have eaten pho and go to vietnamese and chinese restaurants easily, and I have learned to cook.
And yes you will interact with their culture eventually and it is wild
<comment>
I love my gf and she loves me, I barely made any money at all when we started dating, she's with me because she loves me. Real love exists and it happens you're just too cynical to see it.

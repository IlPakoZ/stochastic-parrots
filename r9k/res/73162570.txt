My current gf i got 3 years ago. She actually initiated it which i always think is cute. My gf before her stole my # out of her friends phone who i had hooked up with and then texted me and when i told her i never gave me her number she said i was just drunk and didnt remember. She fessed up later in the relationship. I cant give you copium about getting a gf anon but i can tell you that its never over until you give up. I recently switched into an entirely new career field and it was a huge risk with economy the way it is but it paid off.

The cure to this problem is to teach yourself personal finance. Adulting is really just understanding personal finance and nothing more.

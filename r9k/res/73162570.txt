directionless skillless no friends no connections no future no girlfriend no hope
What age is it over?
Thats normal in your 20s, just wait until youre 30 kid
Its never over fren. Im 37 and still act like im 15 sometimes. I dont ever want to lose that youthfulness.
Oh but i make 6 figures at my job which i love, i have gf, i have a good thing going. Biden is ruining everything though.
When did you get a gf? Later in life? Give me copium
Buy Kleros distribute blockchain justice networks and you wont have a worry
Erm, wrong board. That was a joke btw.
My current gf i got 3 years ago. She actually initiated it which i always think is cute. My gf before her stole my # out of her friends phone who i had hooked up with and then texted me and when i told her i never gave me her number she said i was just drunk and didnt remember. She fessed up later in the relationship. I cant give you copium about getting a gf anon but i can tell you that its never over until you give up. I recently switched into an entirely new career field and it was a huge risk with economy the way it is but it paid off.

Tell me more anon. Do you look like one? :)
close your eyes you'll be on party soon
The cure to this problem is to teach yourself personal finance. Adulting is really just understanding personal finance and nothing more.

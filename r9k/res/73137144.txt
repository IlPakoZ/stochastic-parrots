Lots of women with big tits post here. We're not going to see many in this thread because OP used the wrong picture.
<comment>
Woah what's the right picture?

Nope and I never was. I was the girl with the biggest breasts in a highschool of over 1500 and liked being known as such. 34M by age 15. Significantly bigger now but I don't know by how much since I just started wearing shapewear instead of bras. Not as much support or shape since it basically just pushes my breasts to my belly, but it's cheaper.
I don't show them off because I have a bf, but I don't try and make them look smaller. He doesn't have a problem with people looking at me but it makes me mad since I'm getting mad for him, like they're trying to take me from him or something.

Big breasted women should have big dicked bfs do you agree?
<comment>
Fucking based, how did you meet your bf, what do you like about him
<comment>
Does having such big breast give you greater confidence in terms of being attractive to men?

My bf is 7 inch so yes!
I met him in highschool and he was my type, skinny twig, tall, and cute face. We agree he likely wouldve been an incel if I didn't get with him, so I basically just had to talk to him and he fell in love, especially because I had tidd.
This is a really dumb question because yes, of course I know I'm attractive to men. I don't care about it though because I love my bf.
I'm a terfstacy

Not embarrassed about something a part of me. Used to be in middle/high school but not anymore

Do you think the relationship would still work if he had a small dick, like 4 inches?
<comment>
How much does your BF enjoy them?
Also, post tits.

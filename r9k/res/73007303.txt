Is it worth getting on anti-anxiety medication?
<comment>
No, it's a boring high and the addictive potential is lethal.
<comment>
From my personal experience without knowing what you're going through, no. 
It turned me into a zombie. Felt less emotions, my mind moved slower, I stopped analysing things around me. It gave me the perspective that I'd rather be anxious and aware than dull though

Only if you want your health to deteriorate further. All medication is poison

hell no, and especially not benzos 
drink kefir and take magnesium

not benzos
you'll just end up more anxious than when you started them when you eventually have to get off of them. its very easy to build a tolerance to them and the withdrawals from them are hell. you dont have to be addicted to them to get withdrawals
<comment>
Benzos are suited for recreational use or as-needed meds to deal with acute bouts of anxiety.
Consistent use of benzos has proven to be more detrimental than beneficial and most doctors will not prescribe them as such anymore unless you are already hopelessly addicted and so giving you your pills makes you shut up.

They're fun recreational drugs, theyre not medication
you dont have to be addicted to them to get withdrawals
What do you mean? You arent gonna get any significant withdrawals from moderate use. Obviously you arent supposed to use daily
<comment>
What do you mean?
your body can develop a dependence on them which is different from addiction. they can happen together or without each other. 
Obviously you arent supposed to use daily
yes obviously but plenty of people do and there are doctors who do prescribe enough to be taken that way or out right say to take them that way. i had a doctor put me on ativan 3x a day for half a year and no it wasn't as needed and yes i was dumb and didnt know the consequences of benzos but really the doctor shouldnt have had me on it that long/take it that way.

Different anon, but I was on klonopin (relatively weak shit) and had withdrawal symptoms even though I wasn't abusing. By that, I mean I wasn't taking them for the high. You get a high off of them when initially taking them. This high wears off as you take it more regularly. I was previously on ativan at a minimal dose as-needed and had to keep a record for my headshrink. Same thing there.
I was an low-average dose of klonopin daily for seven months max. Tried getting off them three times after I read about them contributing to early onset dementia. Funny thing, my hueg juggernaut provider doesn't like prescribing them because of the side effects. But they finally put me on them after I started having daily panic attacks after some violent drug addict bum tried to go all defending-m'lady on me.
I won't lie, they weren't bad. Had the most productivity on them I had in recent years, possibly ever. Could actually talk to girls, even my oneitis. Sadly, covid put the breaks on that. And now I'm a bitter incel. (Come get me FBI faggots).

Bruh you can get physically addicted to benzos in a few days. Probably A day.
Rebound anxiety is literally just acute physical WDs.
All my benzo binges never exceeded like 10 days. It took about 3x as long from all these binges to reach baseline again. Of course, I was using extremely high doses in conjunction with alcohol, another gabaerguc drug. 
Just this past weekend I acquired 7 street presses, used them within 3 days with alc, and felt rebound effects ie WDs for a few days following.
Benzos are no fucking joke when it comes to how instantly physically addictive they are.

i went on zoloft for anxiety and depression. it just made me fat.
<comment>
yes and no, i take roughly 50-75mg promethazine depending on the severity on my panic attack, but it just kind make me go into a semi coma where i don't feel anything im just an empty shell that don't feel anything for a couple hours.
It works but nothing i take everyday
<comment>
Maybe. I wouldn't jump to benzos or anything though. If your anxiety is severe I'd talk to a psychiatrist about your options. I took sertraline (zoloft) for years and it just made me numb and dumb. I recently started atomoxetine (strattera) for adhd and that's helped my anxiety more than zoloft ever did lol. Some meds work some some people, be honest and communicate with your doctor and pray that he's not a dumbass.

Zoloft is a gay and jewish devil drug designed to do exactly that
Benzos are a white mans drug designed to combat a problem and in doing so its way too effective causing dependency issues immediately and being highly recreational
Never touch SNRIs or SSRIs. Do benzos if you wanna date rape yourself and feel amazing.

I'm an incel although not celibate by definition. I am ugly. I am mentally ill. I'm a basement dweller. I will always be like this. Having sex has done nothing for me besides realizing that it's really not that great. I have had sex with escorts and one normal girl. None of it made me feel better. In fact, it's making me feel a bit repulsed by sex. I masturbate much less frequently than before now because since experiencing sex, I know it's awkward, disgusting, uncomfortable so I don't want to think about it. It wasn't a pleasant experience for me and I'm not looking forward to having sex with women again. I don't like being around women because I don't like women. I want to be left alone. I feel the happiest when I'm alone. I really want to focus on myself, going to the gym, making money, things like that. I am as mentally ill as I've always been after getting pussy, it did not give me any fulfillment.
go sex ur aunt or something
Do you have some sort of personality disorder
Sex means reproduction
It means continuing the species, and having a stake in the world you care about deeply after you are dead
You're not an incel at all, and why did you have sex so many times if it's disgusting? You could be asexual or gay.
I still identify as an incel even though I'm not a virgin anymore. I had sex to see what it's like. I did not find it anywhere near as good as I expected

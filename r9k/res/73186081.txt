i'm going to a small scifi themed EDM event this Friday and i'd like to bring some extra kandi to give away, in addition to the cuffs i've already made for specific friends
what are some fitting words/phrases/themes that aren't too on-the-nose but also not so generic they could be bulk ordered already made?
Just bring drugs. That will work better.

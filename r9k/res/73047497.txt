Another semester is wrapping up. Still no friends, still no gf. I was thinking the other day, and I realized that I have not enjoyed even one second of college. There has not been one time where I was glad to be in a lecture, lab, etc. There has only been embarrassment and suffering. It's such a foreign feeling when I look at a group of people talking. It's so mind blowing when I see a chad with his arms wrapped around a girl. Like these people are living a life we couldn't even dream of. I regularly go days without speaking a word. Almost like I'm a ghost. Can anyone relate? I think if you've enjoyed even one moment of college, you're a normie.

this is down bad, even by 4chan standards. Have you tried taking a shower?

You have pretty much summed up my experience but I actually somewhat enjoy the isolation now. I get to do things at my own pace and enjoy scenery etc. I will agree that lectures and classes are usually a complete fucking drag. I had to walk out on one the other day because I was expecting to actually learn some useful information for my assignment but the tutor was just talking shit with my social classmates the whole time. Frustrating.
But I do feel satisfied completing a big assignment or going out to find a nice quiet spot to study. Travelling there is my favorite part. Do you drive? It's so nice to go out early in the morning and put on your favorite music and head out to study. 
Yeah of course I wish I had found a nice woman to get into a relationship with or some friends with common interests during my time there but as I near the end of my degree I feel like that wish is kind of irrelevant since the people who surround me there are the kind of people I'm totally incompatible with and can't stand for the most part. I made one casual "friend" who I would happily speak with in classes we had together and I noticed only one girl throughout my whole four years who seemed like my type and really piqued my interest. So yeah there's not really much else I could have done besides change myself into a completely different person to fit in, which I'm not interested in.
But I don't know if "enjoying isolation" is a very sustainable lifestyle in the long term.

Unfortunately yes, thankfully I've since graduated, but you basically summed up my 'college experience'. I'd regularly go days without saying a word. It was like I didn't exist. I felt like I was there, but not a part of what was going on. I felt like I was just observing everyone else having the time of their life. It wasn't so bad since I was away from my parents, but you couldn't pay me to go back.

Exactly my experience. I have made no friends, professors dont like me and everyone probably thinks im some creepy ass school shooter type. I rarely speak at all, in fact im so fucked up at this point that when someone actually does speak to me, I struggle to talk like a normal person. Its like my speech centers have deteriorated and I am no longer capable of regular speech. I feel so weird. There has been multiple occasions where people sort of laugh at me and subtly make fun of me from their friend groups. People think im autistic or theres just something wrong with me, which they are probably right. They cant call me retarded cause I get better grades than everyone and can solve problems and understand things much faster/better, but they know im slow socially. So many times ive been humiliated and just fucking embarrass myself. Doesnt help that I just look like some weird ass faggot too lol. The only thing that keeps my going is the knowledge that ill probably never have to see these people again after i graduate. One thing I will say is that I love learning and love having tasks to complete which keep my mind occupied and keep me busy, I like that aspect of college. I just fucking hate the social side of it. I want to be the best, I get mad when someone finishes an exam before me and I get mad when I dont have the highest mark in the class. They can laugh at me and treat me like an outsider all they want, we will see who comes out on top in the end.

when I see a chad with his arms wrapped around a girl
The amount of sex I've heard in the dorm hallways is honestly tormenting. Just fucking depressing man.
 I regularly go days without speaking a word.
This is scarily accurate. Only time I'll speak is to the person at the cafeteria to scan my card. Either that or when someone comments about my hockey jersey and we talk a bit about that. Also have some online friends, a couple just online and a couple from highschool. 
But yeah, wrapping up first year. Four months of missed classes because of a chronic illness, one semester flunked because of missing exams, zero friends, and zero future prospects.

This thread feels like Deja vu, I swear I saw this exact same one a couple days ago. What the fuck is going on? Am I losing my mind or am I onto something?

nothing extraordinary
i enjoyed some lectures or classes though, because the topics were interesting to me
chilling in the art room drawing after hours when its completely empty was great, because the room i was renting was extremely tiny and i couldnt even put down all my shit for drawing
also some lectures were nice, because nobody came to them pretty much, so you could actually hear it out
all the stuff with other people same
had flatmates getting guys and girls over constantly, so it was annoying as fuck

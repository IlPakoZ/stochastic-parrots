Any rabbit holes anyone is interested in sharing and talking about? I want to know some after dipping into Umineko, Zero Escape, The Trails series and the Project Moon game Trilogy. I'm willing to engage in any cool rabbit hole so long as it isn't anything like conspiracy theories or stuff like the D*ng*nronp* series (sorry for the offensive mention) I want to know some more cool stuff to hyperfixate on after playing some elin and elona

What do you mean by rabbithole, like topics of interests brought up in those games or just random obscure things? Are there any you have in mind? I have played 999, but you reminded me I have to finish Trails in the Sky and Library of Ruina. I have a gutfeeling you might like some of these games if you haven't tried them already

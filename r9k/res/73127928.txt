Why is it incel?
What the fuck even is that retarded zoomer internet word
Just say robot you dorks
Incels come from Reddit, that's all you need to know.
I browsed this place since middle school a decade ago and I still feel like a newfag
I can't imagine the ADHD retards joining today
incel originally just meant "involuntarily celibate" basically no sex, but you want to have sex
but then redditors got a hold of it and then started using it as an alt. word for "neckbeard" 
basically the connotation and denotation are different or something idk, i never payed attention in english class

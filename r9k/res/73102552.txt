i just realized i dont want friends or a gf i just want something to do during the day so im not bored. . .
Nice epiphany retard
i feel pretty content by myself when im working or at school. i only start thinking im missing out when i have nothing to do and my mind starts wandering
"I didn't actually want these things that I thought I did, I just wanted to satisfy a more baser urge, so I can just do that instead."
Yes that is an epiphany, rude prick.
Like a job?

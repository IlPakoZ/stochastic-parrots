This is my 1st month as full time wagie after graduating college . How do I cope
<comment>
you're talking to people who have never had a job it's literally a foreign concept it's all abstract and theory and that world sees them as total subhumans

Lots of this. Then soon you'll learn to disassociate with life and it won't feel real anymore. Then it's easy. It's like watching a movie of someone else's terrible life while your brain just does everything automatically. Keep that up for a while and eventually you'll die and then no more problems.

Feelings are for women
You are a man
You don't piss blood
You don't shit children
They have a modicum of power compared with you even with government and media backing because you are a man
You aren't a slave to genetic programming like they are
You finished college, got a job. Half the women you had as classmates will quit their careers within the next five years, split the difference and those will quit within ten
They are Instagram slaves and got tricked into giving away their bodies for a burger and a couple drinks
You used to have a fucking ring and foot the bill for a party to tap that
Buy yourself a hooker, spit in her face. You got the money

Absolutely this: But I have to ask OP:
Did you get a useful degree
and
Did you actually get a job in your field

I AM A MAN
You are a wagie actually.

you try making friends at work? or at least talk to them during breaks and stuff
best to find someone in a different department it's hard but you won't get tired of them like that
also conferences etc will help
i don't really have friend friends in my everyday workplace but since i'm a contractor i have other friends in the agency. if it weren't for that i'd be pretty lonely right now
i'm in a similar situation except i'm 8 months into my job. >>73096467 is right but just don't overdo the booze or you will have horrible sleep
stuff better for your health tho:
do activities like bowling or some other shit
you got a job so i assume you have the money
clean house often
it gets ya moving plus being in messy house will really drive mood down
i can't really give advice on finding a gf though. i don't even try even though people say i have potential... it's fucking over until i break the mindset

How do I cope
Get a better job

oh shit this thread is still alive
alcohol will help dull the loneliness. it will not get rid of the loneliness. you will just wake up feeling lonely again if you don't put effort into getting out of it.

How long would it take for someone to start thinking you went missing if you killed yourself?
about 10 minutes? maybe less?
Depends if you did it in the living room or not (for the irony)
6-10 hours 
a week probably but only because my mom visits me weekly. if she didn't probably much longer. I'm known to disappear for months at a time
at least a month, probably closer to 2

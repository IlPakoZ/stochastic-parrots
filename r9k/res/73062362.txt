one shot at life
not born a cat living with an owner who loves me and pets me all day, no responsibilities, just playing and sleeping on their lap
This is my deepest wish for reincarnation.
cats are so cute
animal abuse, misogyny, racism, has to go
born a cat
male
owner chops my balls off so I won't breed
I can't breed
still have to hunt rodents for him to be able to eat
being a cat is just being an incel neet with more responsibility and less balls
Id rather be an incel hikki-neet cat than an outside cats who gets bitches then dies to a pitbull
I wish I were my dog
My dog literally pisses himself and shits the floor and I still praise him and call him a good boy (he is 10 years old and incontinent he has a degenerative brain disease that means he is slowly losing control of his back legs and bowels so I don't punish him I just coddle him and help him as best I can)
I say hey reggie do you want... (his ears perk up) a... (he's vibrating) TREAT (he starts screaming and flailing his back legs hardly keeping up and I give him a turkey slice
I wish that was my life. He's so happy and easily pleased

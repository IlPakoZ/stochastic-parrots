Succession is such a fucking dogshit show 
Why do people enjoy this shit
Sorry you're not smart enough to appreciate kino, anon
They are the same people that like crap like better call saul and the wire they are boring men
BCS and The Wire have literally no similarities other than both being good lmao
Boring shows about boring men with crappy "humor"
I thought it was one of those women's shows like those billions of different cops and crime drama shows
No. It admittedly has a big female fanbase but it's basically a political/corporate satire and has very sharp writing. Probably the best show currently airing imo
It doesn't hold a candle to white lotus

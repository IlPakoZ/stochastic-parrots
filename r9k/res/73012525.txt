You know if I got that job or had a job the past 5-6 years instead of wasting it yet again I would have had a substantial amount of money to start investing and escape
now I am set back all those years, yet again
I really don't get how people are poor, If I wasn't a neet I would accumulate so much money so fast it would just snowball regardless even if I were working dead end jobs
Yep time to ruminate and feel bad yet again, the loop never ends

don't get how people are poor
especially if you're like me and live with your parents and have two other siblings that are working full-time and also live with their parents. If it wasn't for my diseased mentally ill mind I would have tens of thousands of dollars by now. My old sister has saved nearly 50k by now.
youre too ugly to be a wagie
You assume other people don't have problems, only you are aware of all your problems, so you assume you have it worse than everyone else.

Is there any other outcome to ignoring your loneliness than depression and/or anger problems? I cannot imagine just accepting being single for life

they alter the suicide notes it's this deep psychological game somtimes I wonder then I know it knows but it also knows nothing

Being single is the default though and loneliness is my normal. Having a virgin gf would be an improvement obviously but I'm fine even if it doesn't happen. I think you just have a case of fomo.

Loneliness isn't real. you faggots don't listen to scientists on anything but when they talk about loneliness you suddenly turn into social scientists

I feel hollow inside, but it isn't that bad. Especially when compared to the past where I felt suicidal everyday. I think I am as close to accepting it as you can be. Right now I am talking to a girl who rejected me in the past and I really don't even want it to go anywhere. Even if I could get her the thought of being together with her is very tiresome.

I don't really understand loneliness. I've gone months without speaking a word. I spend all my free time alone. Often times when I am around people too much I just want to get the fuck away, it's exhausting.
Maybe loneliness is caused by having a deep connection with someone at some point in life and losing it. Never able to get a connection like that again. Is it just nostalgia? I wouldn't know.

be me almost a year ago
live in shitty economy country
parents suggest I go abroad for uni
good idea
be me now
phone with parents
they say I should work some more for government subsidy cuz If we keep things as it is(I already buy cheapest shit foods) I will spend grany's reserves(my half-for uni AND for starting a life)
I already work 24 hour in a month(can't work more, cuz shop where I work only open during school)
there is hardly any part time jobs for foreigners
I will try crypto, but I need some other ideas. What alternative ways for part time jobs? I don't want to shave my legs and open an onlyfans. Oh fuck i will become a real wagie

Gay God sex. Psychopaths hunt me for sport. There are certain rules they play by. I don't know them exactly but I know 100% how to spot one and that they do play by rules, like vampires. They are sick creatures. I have this and only this advantage over them. They have a hive mind of some sort. They always lie to you. A liar is a psychopath and a psychopath is a liar.

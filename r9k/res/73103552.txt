Do you have urges?
Do you let them go unleashed?
Are you still master of your domain?
What game is dis? Shit looks fire.
Are you a fed?
Do you make it clear?
Are you a master at data mining?
I have only one urge to have some meaning in life and it's too greedy to ask for it. Noone gets to have it so why should I?
we've got a herd of niggercattle
I don't give a fuck anymore, it all seems pointless. It's just an endless, hedonistic treadmill.

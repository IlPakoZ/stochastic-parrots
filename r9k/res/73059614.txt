i'm going to clean my room. and my LIFE
tried doing both last week. cleaned my room and quit substances but thats about it.
fuck.
good start. i notice the worse my room is the more i neglect all my other responsibilities as well
yeah. i dunno about my living room tho. if i do the living room i can wipe off the kitchen as well but the living room has a bunch of shit lying around that i dont know what to do with. old books and a bunch of clothes i'm not sure about.
typing it out loud makes me feel like a retard because i literally only have to pick that shit off the floor and let my roborock vacuum once or twice and i can wipe over the floor with the mop.
but even if i do that i have a long road to go.
a bunch of clothes i'm not sure about.
If it was me I would donate it. I feel a lot better when it's gone. Probably would keep the books though
yeah, i could probably just get rid of the clothes. trouble is some of them are brand fucking new but too small because apparently making a universal XL is fucking impossible and ordering online is for idiots.
i've read the books already but i could keep them as trophies. a bunch of textbooks and junk i had in my old room at my moms i'll just throw in the trash.
fuckit, 30 more minutes of goofing off and i'll get to it.
30 more minutes of goofing off and i'll get to it.
Same. Probably. I just started drinking and listening to music, but hopefully....
i notice the worse my room is the more i neglect all my other responsibilities as well
word. when you live in a pile of garbage it sucks the life out of you.
I just started drinking and listening to music
same but with energy drinks.

i don't think mental illness exists, your life is inherently shit, thinking that you can fix it just by having a better mindset and not thinking about bad stuff is retarded because your thoughts are just a retrospect of the past events, you can't control them

Suicide isn't even real. As soon as you kill yourself you wake up again

What about people with mental disorders and disabilities literally having different brain structure compared to ""normal"" people?
<comment>
he even has an external locus of control about his own thoughts 
This is why robots lose before the race even starts

having different brain structure
yeah these are neurological issues, wtf do they have to do with "mental illness"?
<comment>
Also exists within mental illness, unless you're talking about shit like minor-medium depression and anxiety which is just people feeling sorry for themselves.

disorder =/= disability. Thoughts and environment "shape" the brain, the fact that they scan a "depressed brain" and can say "see? it looks depressed" is meaningless. People with good lives do not have mental illness. The majority of people do not have good lives.

what about schizos?

People with good lives do not have mental illness.
Not everyone is capable of having a good life all the time, things like being poor or mentally ill can literally be forced upon you.
If you are poor you cannot afford education, meaning you stay poor, and having shitty parents/surroundings can make you inheret mental illness. It's not always a choice.
Of course it's more likely than not that you can eventually change, but it will take time and a tremendous amount of effort, and it doesn't work for everyone. Some people are destined to fail, that's just life.

people with good lives do not go schizo.

well not much is known about schizophrenia, the causes are not visible to human eye but it's not a mental illness because it's a bogus diagnosis, it's just a label for something you don't understand
<comment>
because the brain changes based on your interactions with your environment? you can scan any arbitrary category of people you want and find some similarities. you're putting the cart before the horse.
free will is philosophically indefensible. the philosophyfags who pretend to believe in it don't come close to the delusional form that normies do. locus of control bullshit is lazy pop psych.

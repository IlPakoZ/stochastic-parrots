I love the sound of De La Soul and ATCQ.
I'm mad that I ignored this style of rap from the early 90's when I was 18.
I was too focused on Wu-Tang, Nas, Mobb Deep, Ice Cube and other "harder" rap music.
I grew up listening to mostly classical music, and I greatly prefer the clean lyricism of the 80s. It shows great respect for the recording medium to be able to dictate without mumbling.

There was no mumble rap taken seriously in the 90s, stop seething.

The onus is actually on you to figure out what is real and what is not. I owe you nothing. Believe what you want, but I have already written you off as stupid anyhow.
Check out Digable Planets if you haven't already, OP: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DbVTKk3jgXU [Embed] 
One of my favorite albums.
It's all shit.
(C)rap.
Bet you never listened to the artists OP mentioned and yet you judge because you're a brainlet, either underage or just pretty stupid

i just went out on a walk alone for what is essentially the first time in my life. is this really what everyone has been telling me to do? it doesnt feel good or fun or anything. i want to be in my room instead of outside. why does everyone want me to talk to people and do things?
They tell you to do it so you're not a fat cunt
Yeah because walking alone makes you not fat. Nothing to do with not eating like a pig.
fat cunt
lol ok anon..
You're deception will never fool me
anything youre not used to doing is going to be hard but sometimes hard things help your grow and help you to appreciate better the things you have in life or something
i eat 300-500 calories a day
what do you mean
no its seriously just boring. i had the opportunity to go out with friends and it is honestly a chore i dislike it. i really prefer staying in my bed all day
Oh I was not saying you were fat, I was just making a remark on their post.
which is now something that you appreciate more now.
yaaay.
A walk in the woods is a lot better. It's very relaxing. What anime is that image from btw? It looks like haganai

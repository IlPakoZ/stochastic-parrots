where and how do I find a girlfriend i dont go out &amp; have no friends whatsoever + i dont rlly feel the need to for any of that
i literally just want to have a girlfriend and get married. i have social media but i dont even have a large social circle on there, at this point im going on tiktok to look for random women my type but its not really working since the algorithm is spastic. im just rlly desperate at this point and on the verge of messaging random women on instagram but i dont even know how to go about that either
anon you need friends first, I want the same as you but I think there's simply no way to intentionally make it happen with being social
without**
It's brootal for introverts or anti-social people. You have to socialise to get many many things in life.

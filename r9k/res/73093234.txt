It's actually only useful if you're a productive person and don't just sit around consuming things. I do gamedev now and nofap has helped a lot with concentration, and honestly it just feels like a waste of time now.

He wouldn't have the need to. When you're enlightened you're capable of joy that far exceeds fulfilling your base urges. I've experienced a glimpse of this and marvel at what it must be like to be a godman guy and not even be capable of sin because it wouldn't even enter your mind just as causing yourself pain doesn't enter your mind

Reading the bible is the equivalent of mental masturbation.
Stop being a faggot, accept reality for what it is and make use of your brief time on earth advancing science.

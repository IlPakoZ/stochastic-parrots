I feel like this has to be some kind of intentional gaslighting there's no way they don't understand how dangerous it is for men to talk to women. Any interaction that is more than courteous and professional is a lawsuit and firing waiting to happen. You AREN'T ENTITLED to HUGS.

What's happening is that women at workplaces think hugs are appropriate first greeting between non-sexually involved men and women and men are having to refuse because they fear sexual assault charges so now the women are whining that the men are "being distant" because they don't think men are entitled to bodily autonomy.

I think companies should just straight up ban socializing on company time. I mean the ideal would be to roll back the rules that make it so dangerous for men to talk to women at work, but that ain't happening, so a hard ban on socializing for all sexes is the next best thing.

Funny to hear this bitch complaining about this. I work at an office of 80% women and my only friends are men for a reason.
<comment>
This might be true, Europe has always been less puritanical about sex.
The reason why this happens is because in U.S. work places you can be fired for sexual harassment even if the conduct you engaged in wasnt intended to be sexual or harassing. Something is sexual harassment if the victim believes it is regardless of the intent of the person doing the harassing. Any type of comment made to the opposite sex about any non-business topic could be considered sexual harassment if the person is offended by it.

The whole men being reported thing is overdramatized and overstated, just like false rape claims. It does not occur nearly as often as men are led to believe. It is a literal psyop being pushed to demoralize young men and prevent them from breeding.
The people who want you to be discouraged, the people instilling paranoia in young men, are the same people pushing liberal feminism and other progressive cancers. I cannot believe men do not realize this yet.

There's a girl at my job with a decent appearance. I saw one day that she needed a ride home (she was walking), and I thought about asking her if she wanted a ride. I decided not too though as it was too risky. Apparently someone else did, though, and mysteriously stopped showing up at work not long afterwards. I eventually heard she filed a harassment complaint against him and he was fired. No idea what happened between them but there you go.

That's probably true but nevertheless I would prefer if women at work would keep some emotional distance from me. You never know when one misunderstanding will lead to another.

He's one of the best 'father figure' influencers because his advice is actually practical. Teaches young men to only go to college if it's for a practical degree that leads directly to a job. It's such a sensible and in hindsight obvious message that is actually similar to what men used to teach their sons back in the old day, as opposed to this Jordan Peterson type stuff which is honestly fluffy and feminine.

Holy shit why this always happen? some girls seem to never have enough of a guy in the office and always want to play with him, they want to make him laugh and and touch his body all the time.
they are just friends but it's impressive how they treat him like they can barely muster energy to say hi to me or other dudes but with the others things are not like that.

there's no way they don't understand
Some people just aren't good at understanding other POVs. And you'll notice that most of these are from the US, as Americans aren't exactly reputed for their empathy.
The part which pisses me off, though, is when someone acts like they're entitled to other peoples' friendships. Friendships, like virtually all social communication, requires mutual consent. And if someone doesn't want to be your friend (no matter why), then they don't want to be your friend. This shouldn't be hard to understand (as painful as it may be).

Overall I find it hard to believe the average woman would have no clue why men are more cold in today's world.
It's not culture's fault she misses it she misses the attention at a human level. She can't just own that seeing the other side of it?

Strange. Three friends of mine were falsely accused of rape. That seems like a lot to me and far more common than I'd like. 
One girls parents pressured her into making the claim, apparently she felt guilty and told the truth before it went to court. Still damaged his social standing though and he left the country shortly afterwards to get away from all the 'friends' who immediately treated him like shit when the story got out.
Another girl strung a friend along for about a year, slept with him at a music festival then went to the police two days later with some crazy story about how he "sadistically abused her" but couldn't keep her story straight and kept dodging interviews with the police. His brother was also accused the same year, I don't know anything about that to be honest other than it was dropped for some reason.
The third didn't even sleep with the cunt that accused him, but rejected her advances when she was blackout drunk so she got upset and tried to bruise herself and claim he did it. 
Even if it "does not occur nearly as often as men are led to believe", fuck that risk.

Despite me sitting with 5 women some dyke comes over and starts screaming how I've roofied her drink and she "saw it"
The girls are telling her to fuck off, that it's a work do and she's just had too much
Crowd starts forming and I'm now guilty and caught in the act of rape and they are looking to beat my ass
The boys get back and start squaring up to defend me
Bouncers come and escort us out
Work party ruined but I at least get home in one piece
Yeh fuck off, the amount of people I know who have been falsely accused is fucking insane and scary and it's why I will have nothing to do with foids. I agree with you, there is an agenda to stop men (coincidently just the white ones) from breeding but we are past propaganda stage now. Foids have eaten the lies and now see every man as a boogeyman containing the animal inside who will rape her if she lets her guard down for a second.

Women are manipulators, users, and abusers. I think that's why so many of them complain about abusive relationships and being mistreated. Since that is what they themselves are, I think they naturally wind up gravitating towards men like that.

She understands perfectly, its just women don't care. Women only care about their personal feelings so while she acknowledges that men are acting that way out of sheer personal preservation, men's feelings don't matter to her so their extremely valid and correct feelings about being seen as creep doesn't override her mild feelings of loneliness.
<comment>
there's no way they don't understand
they don't think mens' self-interest is relevant to how they DESERVE to be treated. That's just how they are, how they always were. Figuring exactly why won't help one bit.
<comment>
Women fundamentally don't understand how men act with each other. They always say just act normal and how you would treat anyone else, but guys are often vulgar and physical with each other. That doesn't translate to women at all, they think you're being fucking gross or a creep and if you dare touch them even remotely, that's sexual harassment. Men are fully aware of this now so now men act in this really sterile awkward manner around women because its the only possible way to act with them. Acting natural with them is a fucking meme.

It just doesn't matter. If you create a risk, sensible people will modify their behavior to try to avoid it. Particularly if the costs of failure are high. And people with high intelligence and with what used to be considered the bourgeois virtues will avoid that risk EVEN MORE than the average person will avoid it.

Unfortunately, this. They're far too easily swayed by their emotions and societal pressures. The ancients were correct, women are like fire, and should be treated as such.
The whole men being reported thing is overdramatized and overstated
Nope. I've been accused at my gym of aggressively coming onto some thot and touching her. If not for my gym buddies who watched our interactions, I would have had a lawsuit on my hands. Avoid at all costs, especially if they're filming. Don't even look at them, and definitely DO NOT ENGAGE with them.

If you create a risk, sensible people will modify their behavior to try to avoid it.
So, you all would agree that it is fair for a woman to be afraid that every stranger that gets on an elevator with her or says "excuse me ma'am" to catch her attention is going to rape her, and for her to refuse to acknowledge them?
You mock those women, get angry at them for being wary, call them paranoid, then turn around and make hysterical claims that it's reasonable to refuse talking to women because they're going to randomly decide to ruin your life.
Which is it? Is it fair to act accordingly to fear of things that have a small chance of happening, or is it ridiculous?
<comment>
While technically you're correct, until false accusation rates drop to those of rape rates (and I mean actual rape, not "we were both drunk and now I regret what happened" type of rape) that anon still got a point.
The fact that any random cuntoid can point at any random guy, scream RAAAAAPE on social media and his reputation will immediately be in shambles is fucked up.
<comment>
You're probably right; the internet likes to exaggerate things. The problem is that both me and women buy into the horseshit. Men are scared of losing their professional lives, while women take twitter as gospel. So its less about men fear getting fired and more about the public perception of men by women. In other words, its a cycle where women think men are creepy because of twitter and men avoid women because of twitter.

I didn't do any of this you just made that up because you're schizophrenic, it's perfectly reasonable to be WORRIED about rape, but women overstate how common rape is, claim that every woman has been raped at some point and claim that every man is a rapist. Let me give you an example; I nightwalk all the time, and I love in an area that has almost zero crime especially not random violence crimes, yet I still conceal carry in the off chance that someone tries to harm me while I walk. Would you say me conceal carrying is the same as me thinking all streets have criminals lying in wait and if you go outside at night you're guaranteed to be accosted by criminals? No, because while the former is a simple precaution the latter is an insane over exaggeration. The risk reward for caution is all risk and no reward when it comes to interacting with women, likewise it's all risk and no reward for women to not be cautious around men while they're alone.
<comment>
I'm not any of those anons, but lets be real here: people don't react to risk with any sort of reason or logic. Its just fear mongering. Acting terrified of a guy in an elevator, visibly terrified, is just as retarded as avoiding women. However, at least avoidance is a neutral response.
<comment>
I have the opposite problem. I work night-shift stocking at a grocery store and my coworkers always try to strike up conversations and make small talk and I absolutely hate it. Like can't you see I'm an autist and want to be left the fuck alone? Stop trying to include me in stuff because you think you're being nice. Just leave me in my corner to work alone and I promise you I will get more work done the rest of you combined. This young female coworker was like "do you need help with the baler", no I fucking don't, like you know I don't so why even ask? My manager gets it at least, he only talks to me when it's essential, but he's been working there for so long though he has probably the biggest weirdos come and go.

Is it fair to act accordingly to fear of things that have a small chance of happening, or is it ridiculous?
The chances of a sexual harassment complaint happening at work are vastly, and I mean vastly, higher than the odds that a white guy who says "Good morning" to you in an elevator is going to rape you. They're not comparable concerns.
They're also not comparable concerns because society specifically is on the side of people who are the victims of crime. Billions of dollars and millions of man-hours are spent every year to try to make sure that you will be safe on an elevator. OTOH, society is explicitly AGAINST the man accused of sexual harassment, regardless of the merits of the accusation. As soon as a complaint is made, you are FOREVER a man "who has been accused of harassment". If you become successful enough to be mentioned in our media anywhere, every time you are mentioned the media will be sure to include a sentence where they say, "Anon, who has faced accusations of sexual harassment in the past..." If you seek employment elsewhere, you are FOREVER an "employee who was accused of sexual harassment." I find it more reasonable to be concerned about risks where society will not back you up than risks where it will.

I've seen two co-workers in my academic/professional life get fired/expelled for doing some trivial shit (joking etc) that made women "uncomfortable." Do I autistically avoid speaking to women at all now? No, I just know not to get too comfortable. I have no issue working with women professionally but we're not engaging in "banter" and I'm never saying anything that wouldn't be in a PG movie around them. I'm also not typing any "wild" shit in any work group chat or anything like that that can easily be twisted and thrown back in my face later. There's no logical reason for a man in 2023 not to follow these simple workplace rules.

If lying about rape was so uncommon, then the 1 in 4 stat wouldn't remain a part of sex ed on a national level.

the odds that a white guy who says "Good morning" to you in an elevator is going to rape you.
That's the men women claim to be wary of, I'm talking about in reality. We all know what color of man makes a woman cross the street.
The odds of a woman falsely accusing you of anything are far lower than rape in general, that's only logical when you consider the motives behind the crimes. A man automatically has something to gain from rape, but a woman only has something to gain from false accusations under specific circumstances. You're thinking of men in the workplace, you're not thinking of every homeless street guy and low income areas of blacks and white trash, where sexual crimes are most common and rampant at that. The idea that false accusations is more common than sexual assault crimes as a whole is quite possibly the most retarded series of electrical signals to ever pass through neurotransmitters of the homo sapiens 
As soon as a complaint is made, you are FOREVER a man "who has been accused of harassment".
If you seek employment elsewhere, you are FOREVER an "employee who was accused of sexual harassment."
Literally you are proving the point that it's a psyop men are falling for.
The most common legal penalty for sex crimes even proven is absolutely nothing, much less those that are not found to be true.
Like, you can look this up, they usually don't even get fired unless found guilty, and yet probably millions of men believe your life is ruined on the spot. The only way it would affect future employment is if 1) an investigation found you guilty, 2) you apply to a job at the same company which doesn't make sense, or 3) you use someone who believed it as a reference. If you're that paranoid, opt to not have a previous employer contacted when applying.

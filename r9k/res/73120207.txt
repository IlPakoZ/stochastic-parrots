Does your dream woman resemble your mother (or your father if you're gay)?
If not then maybe some other family member or a figure from childhood?
Full disclosure I am attracted to people that resemble my mother/brother
More personality/wise than anything else. 
My mom was caring, but critical as fuck, and I tend to get attracted to girls that speak their mind.
There were also a plenty of life experiences that explains my current preferences pretty
Personality wise yea
Hmmm, my mom was a romantically inexperienced woman that my Dad groomed to be his perfect housewive and I wish I could do the same if I found someone like my mom. So yeah, guess Freud had a point.
My dream woman would be just like me, but more energetic and clean.
GOD DAMN I wish I looked like that
Yeah almost married a girl who looked like my Mom/Sister. Fell in love with her right away too. I am not attracted to my family members though.
I think so if you have a good relationship with your mother. I read about anons here who have awful relationships with their moms and I don't imagine they would want to date or fuck someone similar (unless it was revenge or hate fucking).
My Mom, yes. I want a big-titted brown wife.
Based brownwife lover
Does your dream woman resemble your mother
Yes
Are you attracted to your mother/family member
Yes
Yes
My mom's non-white, obese and ugly as shit so for my case he couldn't have been more wrong lmao
Yeah personality for the most part. She has her flaws but I love her very much. Looks don't matter to me as much anymore as long as they are not clinically obese or so ugly I can't stand to look at her.

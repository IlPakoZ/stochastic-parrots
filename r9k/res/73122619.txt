I like cute boys but none live anywhere close to me, idk how to find one
<comment>
What? I see cute boys all the time. You should move into the city then
<comment>
I've lived in a small town in the south my whole life, cities seem like dens of disease, so you move to me instead

maybe country life could be comfy, we could take care of a farm together
<comment>
farming seems pretty nice, I like working with animals a lot and I've gotten pretty strong lately, you can be my farmwife
<comment>
Well I'm not that strong... But I can fish and I can feed the sheep with you.
I would gladly be your farmwife then.

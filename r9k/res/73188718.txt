Why are short guys so hellbent on being "masculine"? A 5'3 brown guy at my college used to have fluffy slightly longish-hair, dressed loosely with oversized shirts and baggy pants, and was somewhat effeminate. He was a total babe. Now he has a shaved head, wears tight shirts and jeans, and has even started behaving more "aggressive".
Literally why would he do this? He went from a pretty boy to a by-the-numbers moid. God I hate men.

Umm, I'll try to act more feminine if you want me to, foid. How do I achieve that? Could you give me a guide on how to do that?

You are a minority of women. Granted that most women wouldn't like either way since he's fucking 5'3
but they'd definltiy still prefer him to dress and look masculine

Fucking hell why does this subhuman sex have rights again, every fucking thing is filtered by their gina tingles instinct they cant function at all unless their tingles is gratified and the inverse of gina tingles is gina drygles. The poor manlet is doing exactly what his brain would make him do OH NO YOUR LIKE NOT HOT YOU DONT DESERVE TO ACT LIKE A MAN TEEHEE.

I'm a short ugly guy who doesn't care about being masculine. But I have women, even the feminist women who talk about how bad gender roles are when apploed to women, saying that I'm gross and should be more masculine. Seems like I'm going to rot alone unless I pretend that I'm not an unmasculine male feminist incel and instead act like some dumb masculine chad-wannabe
Also why didn't you ask your short pretty boy out before he went masc?

he's just trying to escape the matrix

Tell him he should wear in-shoe lifts that way he can at least be 5'5. It's what I do and it boosted me from 5'8 to 5'10.

If you are a woman who genuinely wants a non-manly man (you almost certainly don't actually want that and are just saying you do), then it is on you to put that out into the world and if you can't find that you only have other women to blame. Fact is that it is women who are putting absolutely insane standards of masculinity on men. I can't even talk to a girl I'm romantically interested in about a neutral topic or else I'm considered just a friend. You have to come on incredibly strong or you don't get any romantic reciprocation. Don't think about talking about any sort of insecurity or emotions you have either, or else you will be dropped for giving her the "ick." If you truly want men who aren't gender confirming then your first order of business should be to start shaming other women who shame men that deviate even slightly from the unrealistic masculine standards they have.

extremely true. they tell you to "talk to a woman like a regular person, women are just people, be normal" etc. so of course you do that- but by doing so you reveal to them that you are after all not perfect, you're human, and perhaps in some ways vulnerable. then they find you gross and don't want to talk to you anymore. it's a horrible feeling when you've been chatting with a girl for a while about whatever comes to mind and eventually without realizing it you "give her the ick" by not being a perfect pillar of idealized masculinity or by not being a perfectly 100% established human who has learned ever lesson life has to offer at the age of fucking 23

There's a guy I used know he's 5'3 has a 10" dick &amp; is super skinny. Still a khhv. Lol. Imagine having a gigantic cock in your soul fucking virgin and I have a 5" dick and not a khhv retard.

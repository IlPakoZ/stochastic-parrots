All the Chads were killed off in WW2 and their genes disappeared. If you look at soldier photos from then, there were tons of hot guys, but they all died before they got to procreate.

they have a lot of responsibility in how we evolve. the system is that they have to select the best to produce in a range of better, so they pick the top 20%. as a limitation/imperfection of the system, some things definitely can skew the perception of who the best mate is, but shit nigga designing an evolving/living/surviving species that grows to be so intelligent is difficult and i don't think you'd do better.
i'm not really religious, but after doing a few software projects, i can empathize.

God gave us all the ability to kill and rape and that's what turns women on more than anything, coincidence? Of course not.

Have you tried sleeping pills? If you're low on money you might want to cut on your expenses or suck it up until you'll be allowed to live comfortably.

allowed to live.
sleeping pills sound good tho.

Well, the possibilities are endless after all~

knew this neighbor lady.
would do chores for her for pocket money.
she got into a car accident...
on meds for pain.
was divorced and retired.
would spend her nights drinkin.
so she either accidentally or intentionally took too many pills and died. was dead for 3 days before she was found. damn. the ending of life can be so meaningless.

Unfortunately people lose their minds when they're overwhelmed by the suffering of attachments~

not sure if the injection of buddhist thought is fitting, but the fate of a spinster rather tragic. stagnation leads to death.

That depends on the spinster, it's never too late to retrace your steps and walk the path of life~

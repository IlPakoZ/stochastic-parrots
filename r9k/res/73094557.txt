Try them all. It's a number's game. Also, if you're a grown ass man and have your shit together, matchmaking/matrimony websites might work better for you.
I know reddit is "le big bad" in here, but there's this subreddit called r/foreveralonedating. Send 3 DMs everyday to profile of your choice, and within 3 years you're statistically almost guarenteed to find something (even if 1 in every 1000 women find you attractive).
People here don't get laid because they don't put themselves out there.
Also, BIG DISCLAIMER: Most attemps will elad to rejection, but if it works 5% of the time, then that's 1 women for every 20 attempts, or 10 women for every 200 attamepts, or 100 women for every 2000 attempts. If you're the kinda guy who'll try 5 times then give up than it's guarenteed not to work.

Getting that much plastic surgery will reduce your chances of success because you'll NEVER look like a natural chad. And guess what, yout don't NEED to look like a natural chad if your goal is just to get A girl, ANY girl at some point in your life before you die. Now, if your goal is to get e-girls/tiktok zomettes, then yeah you need to look like chad and you can kiss that goodbye because you'll never look like chad.

Then provide me the cure to this "virus"
Oh wait, the cure is looks and charisma, not something I can help considering I'm socially avoidant.

<comment>
You eventually just learn to use logic above all, which makes life completely empty. You come to understand its empty and accept it for what it is, because when you're ready to leave you know you can at any time.
Basically just acceptance. It will happen with time or if you're unable to view things from a simple point of view like "life's good"
Instead you will ask why life is good, look into those mechanics, realize how at its core it is awful, and end up not expending energy on stress or sadness.
If you're not the thinker let time numb your emotions. If you're a thinker good work, you get to exist meaninglessly.
<comment>
The cure is simple: GET YOURSELF OUT THERE. Go to match making websites, send 3 DMs a day for 3 years. It is STATISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE for you to find nothing. Even at a 0.1% success rate, you'll still manage to land a woman. This is what you guys don't understand, it's not even about self improvement, it's just the sheer lack of exposure that's killing your chances. If the only time you speak to a woman is when you check out your groceries at walmart, then you'll end up single forever no matter how much self improvement you implement. This is why black people get laid often (and a lot of them are UGLY AS SIN), it's because they're all over the place: they are very low inhib, they DM any girl they want, they attend events all over the city, they're always vocal on twitter about something, they make 10 sexual advances aday. THIS is the missing ingredient, not "looks" or "self Improvement" (looks do matter a lot, but they're useless without the exposure).
<comment>
To add on: You can only feel things like sadness/sorrow/guilt/etc from ego. Learn to let go of it due to the meaninglessness of life, hence the logical point of view. It also means you let go of happiness, but that's fine - the elimination of your emotions if what matters.
And yes, this is objectively a coping method; if you can tap into it, use it. You don't seem like you're close to apathy, so you will need time or enough suffering that you can no longer feel.

There are certain base standards that make you completely and utterly unfuckable if you fail to meet them, like not having your own place past your early twenties, or being both ugly and socially awkward simultaneously.

those black guys have insane confidence + the very much known stereotype of a gorilla cock hard carrying them. not to mention most of them are on the taller/more athletic side, just helping them out even more. you dont get that from other races right out the gate. even if a chud tried his hardest he probably would get a landwhale by the time he's 30+

lol why do incels ignore things like this and keeps harping on about how u cant get laid unless chad?
i guess it defeats the illusion kek
<comment>
because it proves that chad is a personality yet still unattainable. it doesn't change much
<comment>
You really think 2 out of every 3 posts here are genuine? You're crazy. I'd say 1 out of every 10 posts is NOT a psyop, at best. Having seen this board a decade ago and comparing it to now, I feel like I'm one of the few remaining actual anons here.
<comment>
Yeah but women even say they arent packing like they say they do. Everything you see on media is a psyop anyway. Other Avon is right. Just keep talking to different women. Be direct
<comment>
What you don't understand is that those odds are awful and demoralizing in and of itself. People here want to have a decent opportunity - throwing out hundreds of messages, either with or without effort in a short time span to play the numbers game, makes it feel completely empty. Its the same reasoning why most people don't play the lottery. I do not want to engage with something this awful where I'm set up to lose.

Spam THE SHIT OUT OF THEM. And expect to be rejected most of the time. Dude, you'll get rejected so much it'll become a trivial matter, rejection will become like wiping your ass. Those very very few wins you get will lend you a gf. That's it, that's how you make it. In 3 years or so you'll get something.
If you are Christian then you can nichemax as well.
There are also IRL dating match making services who get paid if you end up with a macth. Like IRL people working to find you a partner. They can even give you advice face to face.

1. You talk to stacies who are above your leage.
2. You have an unaproacheable/autistic facial expression.
<comment>
So what if you get cheated on when you're 40? At least you had years worth of sex. You guys should stop looking as sex as this noble pursuit, reproduction is amoral and apathetic. There's nothing noble about fucking a hole. Go fuck a hole and if she cheats then get another hole. Simple as.
You soft ass niggas piss me off, I swear.

stop saying that shit so fucking sick of faggots telling me I didnt lower my standards
<comment>
There is no above your league. Dudes see a pretty women and think shes special. What did she do? Nothing. She was just born lucky and guys that think theyre not enough start compensating by being a desperate simp
<comment>
So you actually did lower them?

This. Only talk to women you find attractive. This 
shes out of your league
is retarded. 
Shes pretty
So what? She was born lucky, her being pretty doesnt make her automatically valuable

But girls like those are being hounded by guys who are better looking, richer, and more socially apt than us
<comment>
I am a 5'3", 97 lbs manlet subhuman who gets confused for a young teenage boy despite being nearly 26 years old, even when growing facial hair. It's like my puberty ended halfway through, so I'm basically only attractive to the .01% of females that are literal pedophiles, except I'm not even an actual child. On top of that I am a diagnosed autismo who struggles with social interactions and lives off of autismbux at my parents. I am uncomfortable with anything relating to intimacy and have escaped the very rare instances in my life when a girl has potentially shown interest in me. Even my own mom only got to get a hug out of me about twice in my life as far as my memory goes. I struggle to look at people in the eyes when talking to them, I've had no friends for the past 5 years, and I all around live in my own mind. All I do of my time is spend countless hours on my computer rotting my brain away at 4chan and watching Twitch streams to create the illusion of a social life that I can never truly have, even in the few friend groups that I've been in years ago I was either the outcast or they were about as autismo as me. I also do some home tasks for my mom during the day, especially since she recently had her uterus removed (cancer). I only ever go outside for walks, when getting a haircut or occasionally going to the store.
I am most likely never getting a gf, no matter what. I have to learn to accept my fate.
<comment>
There is a high chance you will experience it before you die, unless you die prematurely. 
I'm a 44 year old virgin with a birth defect that has disfigured my body. Plus I'm neurodivergent and I intend to creep out women with my mannerisms. It's not going to happen for me
<comment>
So? Why do you give a fuck? Shes only gonna fuck with one guy and its you, the guy that gets her always believes he was gonna get her. I also notice you put sage in the wrong place, you say some generic 
what about other guys
You are a disinformation agent and trying to demoralize
<comment>
This over-optimistic advice is the reasy why incels became averse to dating advice in the first place. Looks standards do exist dude, and leagues as well. Not everyone is creatdd equal, but most if not all men can get a woman that matches them. If a bellow average guy hits on an e-girl or tiktom zoomette, then I can guarentee it's not gonna work.
<comment>
Mmmh, maybe not. I'll still toss the coin if I were you.
<comment>
That sage was from the last thread I posted in
Explain why she'll pick me (balding, can't hold a conversation or eye contact, lives at home) over the handsome charming guy with his own place and car.
<comment>
Theres so proof that this
below average dude cant get her
sees ugly dude with hot egirl 
brooo, how did he do that? Hes probably rich or something 
Dawg he was himself. These guys that get the girls they want they have this mindset 
im her type
<comment>
even I know talking to girls I find attractive is pointless because they already got hundreds of simps in their inbox doing the same thing
<comment>
Beat the simps.
<comment>
You sound like a lame bitch dawg. Fix your mindset 
It should be
shell pick me cause Im the guy
Also, notice how you think you need a car and expensive house?
If a woman likes a guy, she wont care about the car or house he has. Its why you see some girl that comes from money date a broke dude cause if his sex appeal, and hes some normal looking dude
<comment>
Why are you worried about other guys? Real Gs dont worry about simps. Women dont respect simps so they just use them for attention anyway. The Guy would show up tell her whats up
<comment>
im the guy
Meaningless
No woman will date a guy who lives with his parents pushing 30
<comment>
just don't be the simp bro
hahaha fucking idiots. what is the difference between a simp and a "high value man" to a woman? nothing besides charisma which no one has outlined how to get
<comment>
Apply for job you have no qualifications for
Know you're competin with guys who hae years of experience in the field and have more appealing personalities
hurr they'll totally hire me cuz i'm the shit
<comment>
A simp: Beats arround the bush, is afraid to be sexual, buys her shit, hangs arround for more than a few weeks, is very meek and sumbissive.
A man: Makes his exual advances directly and from day 1 (in a subtle way, don't just say "I find u hot, let's fugg"), either gets her or moves on, doesn't develop onetis, doesn't hang arround for more than 1 week if it leads to nothing, doesn't buy her shit, is speaking to 4 different women at the same time.
One word of advice though, don't do this with anyone you know personally. You don't wanna mess up your social circle/livelyhood. Strangers only.
<comment>
The latter will just get you called a creep or worse if you're ugly
<comment>
Also, listen to this nigga. Adopt his mindset. He was overweight and had diabetes (RIP Patrice O'Neal).
<comment>
doesn't hang arround for more than 1 week if it leads to nothing, doesn't buy her shit
congrats, you know how to make women fucking HATE you. and not in a good way. they will treat you like garbage if these intentions are clear
only simps get women's time and that's what really matters, it's what gives you the chance to make advances in the first place
<comment>
So what of she calls you a creep? What dop you lose? Do it until one of them doen't call you a creep. Simple as.
But she'll call the cops
That's why I said don't do it with anyone you know IRL
<comment>
Cope, hapas are Chads, even Elliott has millions of girls shlicking over him
<comment>
How can they treat me like garbage if I'm already out of the picture?
it's what gives you the chance to make advances in the first place
What gives you a chance to make advances are open DMs on an okcupid profile. Simp for one second and you're dead in her eyes.
<comment>
I like how OP completely ignored >>73095365
<comment>
Didn't OkCupid make it so you can only DM people you've matched with, which never happsn if you're ugly
<comment>
Theres women fucking guys like that
High value man is retarded, it makes zero sense. You have value as you are. You are enough. You guys need a mouthpiece.
This is women, not a job application, this is why you guys mess up 
This right here
Not true. The ones where you read about, he was being super creepy. Guys who do it properly make the girls week even if she doesnt take his offer
Patrice O Neil wasnt handsome and was fat yet he had women on speed dial
<comment>
Nichemax. Some girls like cute/adorable/shy guys. Just make sure to increase your exposure. Expect a shitload of rejections and a few wins, cling to those wins and you'll get a gf. what I said in other replies basically. Also, don't put on a fake extroverted/tough guy act. Wear your weaknesses like a shield and they shall never be used against you. Your shyness and "softness" will be your assets to get the girls who are into this.
<comment>
You're being pedantic, replace okcupid with r/foreveralonedating

I have empathy, if I were a girl I wouldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole

Wow, a rich celebrity could get laid

You have value as you are. You are enough.
I am ugly and live at home and have no social life and make shit money and cannot hold a conversation and am extremely timid
<comment>
Then find a girl who is ugly and lives at home and has no social life and makes shit money and cannot hold a conversation and who is extremely timid
<comment>
The woman doesnt respect you if she does this, if she wants you, shes not making you wait for shit. Simps think this will work. Ive a guy he in the friend zone for a decade on YouTube cause he thinks shell give him the pussy in two more weeks
<comment>
So you identified everything that bugs you yet you dont try to fix it, why? Also stop being timid. Being meek wont help you with women. You can still get women with all that too, but at the same time, you gotta be a man worth following
<comment>
You're forgetting the part where I'm an autistic retard who can't into intimacy but alright
Expect a shitload of rejections
I don't chase girls and never will, it's just not programmed in me
<comment>
Sending a DM is generally a low investment move, I wouldn't call it chasing. It's just a few lines and you're not getting exposed, as opposed to doing a clod approach (which I do not recommend).
<comment>
She's already dating a normie, most of those things don't matter for women besides being ugly
The ugliness and social retardation are out of my control, and the only decent-paying jobs for someone like me are hell on earth
I'm timid because I know I have very little worth on almost every scale
<comment>
She didnt reject you, she passed up on her biggest blessing. You need practice. Use dating apps and wherever theres women, theres also relationships and sex to happen. Look up Mr. Locario, The Man Mindset, Mr. 1950, Kzaggin on YouTube. These guys are masters at game and is what helped me
<comment>
Cold approach is actually the most optimal. Its the most bold, most efficient, and most direct. Women respect it and dig it since majority guys arent approaching
<comment>
She didnt reject you, she passed up on her biggest blessing.
I laughed out loud, how do you delude yourself like this? Is it a low IQ exclusive perk?

Raise your vibration. You know what you need to do for the stuff that bothers you. Become a man with a plan and a man of action
Theres uglier, poorer, dudes fucking the same broad
<comment>
I'm sure glad that ugly awkward guy tried to hit on me today
<comment>
Sure, I'll just raise my facial attractiveness by three points and remove my autism
<comment>
It's the one that requires the most calibration and cames with the highest cost of messing up. God forbid he does it in his campus and acquires a reputation. Hard disagree. Cold apprioach game should be left for night clubs and festivals (and it works wonderfully in those environments, especially if the girls are high on molly).
<comment>
How do you know it didnt make her week? You see yourself in bad regards so you think its terrible. How many times have women talked about a guy that talked to her and she said he was giving her a good time and enjoyed 
Thats you, theres ugly guys that arent awkward making womens days and women enjoy these guys company
Women want to have fun and feel good
<comment>
How do I avoid getting demoralized though after all the rejections?
<comment>
Exposure therapy. Get used to it.
<comment>
If I were a girl I would feel insulted if a guy like me approached her, my self-esteem would get fucked
I can't help but be awkward, I'm too self-conscious to think of anything funny or interesting to say to women
<comment>
We do not think alike in the slightest. It's like talking to an alien, we do not perceice the world in the same manner
Sending a DM
I don't even own a phone, I already said I rarely go outside.
<comment>
This rating scale is retarded. One persons 10/10 is anothers 6/10
I dont believe autism is a factor anymore since its just them being awkward since they dont have much experience, you can literally fix it by practice. Theres also hideous dudes that have a great sex life. And no, they dont pay her, take her out, none of that cupcake shit
<comment>
Then perhaps you won't get women after all.
<comment>
That's what I said from the beggining
<comment>
Cold approaching is direct, fast, and efficient. If hes awkward or creepy then yeah hell get problems. Put your bid in and get out. Thats why women say creepy, cause the dude keeps rambling on
<comment>
Women are generally attracted to the same handful of features (tall, strong jaw, hunter eyes, etc.)
I dont believe autism is a factor anymore since its just them being awkward since they dont have much experience
Autism literally means your brain is wired incorrectly for social shit, it's not a matter of "experience"
<comment>
You didnt get rejected, she passed up her biggest blessing
This. Once guys get some steam going and have women in and out of their lives, they dont get bothered by it
<comment>
Even if you put your bid and get out you'll acquire a reputation as "the guy who approaches women" in your workplace or university/school. Don't shit where you eat. Women are open to being cold approached in nightclubs and not elsewhere.
<comment>
Dawg. You have problems you have to fix then. So make yourself a plan for the next six months to fix any bullshit and then do it

This is why black people get laid often (and a lot of them are UGLY AS SIN), it's because they're all over the place: they are very low inhib, they DM any girl they want, they attend events all over the city, they're always vocal on twitter about something, they make 10 sexual advances aday.
Black men are one of the more sexless demograics outside a minority, and the hoodrats having all the sex are fucking obese hoodrats normal men wouldn't want to touch in a million years.
<comment>
Guy who approaches women
how is that bad at all??? Lmao. Dawg bro if you see women you want, put your bid in
<comment>
In what way is this doublethink
You are a demoralize agent. You didnt even directly reply to OP, just swooped in and tried to shit up the thread
<comment>
Single does not mean sexless. Do you think a Tyrone who fucks 2 girls a week will say that he's in a relationship?
The infographic even says it "Note:"Single" adults are those who are not married, living with a partner or in a commited romantic relationship."
<comment>
You are enough as is
You can't get anything until you fix yourself
<comment>
Why are you worrying about other dudes? You guys want pussy so why worry about something completely unrelated?
These dudes need to stop worrying what other dudes are doing
<comment>
What's the point when every other guy who she's turned down this week is more desirable than you?
<comment>
I never said this. Dude thinks this stuff js holding him back so i told him to get it out the way. Why? Cause hell deal with that stuff, then hell have no excuse left
<comment>
It's shows your inability to secure one. Picture this: Guy approaches Becky, she says no, then goes to Stacy, she says no, then moves to Sarah, she says no. Beck, Stacy and Sarah meet up for lunch and discuss their interactions with the guy. It has been now established that he is unable to get a woman and that he failed at achieving abundance. His social status goes to the dumps.
Also, HR will fire his ass.
The biggest advantage of cold approach, anonymity, is lost.
<comment>
Guys are generally attracted to the samw features
nice titties or ass
pretty face
So? Theres models with a million followers and girls think all guys want that yet they would date a girl they find attractive who isnt a model or nothing. Di you know that most dudes and women dont look like chad or stacy and yet have good relationships and sex lives?
<comment>
The difference is girls can all flock to the few guys who do have those features, while most guys have to fight over the scraps
<comment>
How do you that?
If the guy was more desirable, why did she turn him down?
Put your bid in and get out. Thats it. Nothing else
<comment>
This is a fake scenario you make uo in your head. Youre infected with a mind virus. Look up Mr. Locario to help you with this. Hes a master at game
<comment>
Because she's holding out for a REALLY desirable guy
Point is I'm bottom of the barrel
<comment>
This isnt true at all irl
This 
few guys get the girl
Is dumb, the guys who arent awkward goofy lame and know how to talk to women do wonderful. You need to learn how to persuade with your words
<comment>
You are bottom of the barrel cause you tell yourself that. Tell yourself that youre the guy. Change your perspective
<comment>
Words mean nothing if you don't have anything to back them up

Cope, I'm in highschool in the Midwest and the biggest slayers are black guys because they are low inhib and confident and sociable. Not autistic neets like the average r9kcel
<comment>
I've been in "game" for close to a decade now. I'm not blackpilled and I've had mustiple relationships in the past. This just my conclusion and the conclusion of multiple dating coaches. It's almost an unspoken rule in the PUA communikty (before the redpill even became a thing). There's a lot of things a man can do to attract a woman, but being over-optimistic and adopting this "I can do anything" mindset is what gave pick up advice such a bad reputation for incels (and rightfully so). I can guarentee you that if the average /r9k/bot started cold approaching at random in their university or workplace that it will be a trainwreck of monumental proportions.

it's on women for not choosing the autistic neets. sorry
<comment>
I could tell myself I'm """the guy""" but I'd still be ugly and live at home and have no social life and make shit money and not be able to hold a conversation
<comment>
Pick up
Blackpill
Redpill
Its all bullshit
Guys who are bad with women, goofy, awkward, low self esteem, get a bad reputation cause they did it to themselves. They always approach with a losers mindset and a winners. They get stunned when they see a guy who believes in himself and doesnt hold himself back
<comment>
Well then fix it. The Guy would
<comment>
How do you have a winner's mindset when you're the polar opposite of everything a woman looks for in a man?
<comment>
So you think a guy from here can start approaching his coworkers and everything will go down smoothly with no HR complaints or anything.
<comment>
This is true. I've been researching blackpill and lookism recently and came across videos where blackpillers are perplexed normie guys have gfs. They even autistically made theory for it called "oofy doofy theory". 
https://youtu.be/65HrtrS0mTE [Embed]
They don't understand that simply being neurotypical and sociable plus approaching tons of women will eventually get you a gf. They sit in their basements researching which autistic surgeries to get instead of improving their personalities.
<comment>
Yes. He just needs to put his bid in. Also guys need to talk to women outside of work. Ive seen dudes try to pick up women at work and they can tell he doesnt talk to women outside of it
You just have a winners mindset. Also, yoh identify everything that bothers you yet dont want to fix it. Winners work on everything
<comment>
All this is bullshit. The average
neurotypical 
Is some lazy dude, no game, no confidence, low self esteem, awkward, goofy. You pull these anecdotal evidence and its some guy who isnt terrible with women. You need game
<comment>
A man: Makes his sexual advances directly and from day 1
How

By this same logic pajeets are rolling in women

<comment>
Most guys get laid sometimes
<comment>
Theres literally posts of indians with attractive women. They literally just didnt give af and approach. This is why normies and npc gets relationships, they just operate and go. Only dudes who overthink mess it up for themselves in the moment
<comment>
Guys getting laid are ones that have skin in the game
Dudes who go out to meet women
You need a mouthpiece
<comment>
jesus loves us, even the ugly incels. if sex was important we'd all be having it. turns out its actually better to watch chad have sex and to be constantly suicidal.
<comment>
Yes, the average neurotypical does that
<comment>
Mossad agent. No one is falling for this
<comment>
So why arent you doing it?
Women are letting anyone get the pussy today
<comment>
Even my hideous and more autistic friend than me finds dates by scouring dating sites and talking to randoms. It usually leads nowhere because he can't stop talking about Pokemon and politics though.
<comment>
Because I'm socially retarded and ugly, a shrink told me I might be an aspie
<comment>
He was being unapologetically himself and got womens attention
<comment>
Ugly dont really matter. Women date ugly dudes. Ive seen it so many times
Sex starts when you first talk to a woman
I got this from The Man Mindset on YouTube 
Socially retarded? You can practice talking to different women and itll fix itself
<comment>
mentions man mindset on youtube two times
yeah im going with shill on this one
<comment>
Anon I've been working retail jobs for a decade and still can't talk to people
Not everyone is fixable, I bet you're not an autist
<comment>
You don't understand statistics. I'm sorry. Maybe take a math class?
<comment>
Im not shilling. Ive been watching these guys and they have taught me so much
Also, how is it shilling if youtube is free
<comment>
Improbable, not impossible. You're being pedantinc, you get what I'm trying to say.
<comment>
Theres more places to talk to people than work though
I dont really believe in autism anymore. I think its what (((they))) call it cause they dont operate like everyone else. Other poeple on discord have called me autistic 
I think its just the next evolution in humanity and normies are scared. Normies arent interesting at all and are low energy
<comment>
I'm not being pedantic at all. You don't understand statistics. There are more men who want to date than there are dateable women (Women who aren't total sluts, whores, skanks, and chad chasing holes). Pigeonhole principle makes it impossible for every man to get a gf.
<comment>
Autists can't get laid so that's retarded
If you were able to fix yourself, you clearly weren't autistic
<comment>
Autistic dudes get laid but you only pay attention to the ones that dont 
Statistics are complete bullshit
<comment>
Bumble has a 43% women and 57% men ratio. There's a reason why I didn't include Tinder (21.9% women and 78.1% men) in my recommendation >>73095242. Other "traditional" match making services also have a male to female ratio that is close to 1.
Is that it? Is that your compaint? And you said you weren't being pedantic?
<comment>
Mathematical observations of how the world works are bullshit
Also the symptoms of autism are complete vagina repellent (inability to pick up on social cues, being emotionally flat, hyperfixation on certain topics, etc.)
<comment>
I tried Bumble for months and didn't get any matches so I couldn't message anyone in the first place
<comment>
How do you know the data isnt skewed? Cause statistically, 66% of statistics are wrong
You can learn to pick up on social cues and how to lead a conversation
<comment>
You can learn to pick up on social cues and how to lead a conversation
Not if you're genuinely autistic
<comment>
Pay for premium is what i would do
<comment>
Then try non-match based alternatives like r/foreveralonedating
<comment>
You really are missing the point. If there are more men than women then it is impossible to assign each man to a woman. it's basic fucking math. Please, I hope to God you're trolling. please!
<comment>
Your brain isnt a rock. It can learn new things
<comment>
The autistic brain is hardwired differently
<comment>
Yes. Better hardware since It isnt susceptible to propaganda. Most dudes who say they have autism dont have it and are just socially awkward 
You can learn to talk to women and talk to people in general
<comment>
I know, you nigger. What I typed was a message that carrried nuace and that was mean to be understood by humans and not taken lietrally, I did not type a line in a command terminal. But since you're an AI, I'll accomodate you:
Acoording to currently available estimates from 2021, there are 101 men for every 100 women in the world. This means that ONLY 99.00990099% of the male population can be matched with a single female. This number goes down to a STAGGERING 98.99% if we factor in polygamy.
Kys.
<comment>
Austism can help you get an alt/equally autistic girl.
<comment>
Pfffft
Most autistic girls want normie guys, look to this board for proof
<comment>
Most girls here aren't autistic
<comment>
Not true at all. You guys dont even notice. You only pay attention to one type of girl

If I could get better at it I would have by now

More bullshit
Any time a girl posts she gets swamped
<comment>
Based on the stuff you tell me. You arent trying at all. Are you going out every weekend at coins to meet women? Are you on dating apps and talking to women?
<comment>
This. All their incel arguments are just the result of their mind virus but they dont realize it
<comment>
They weird her out. They start posting how they have feelings and shit off of one pic. Thats why. They give off desperate vibes. They dont put their bid in. They just keep begging. Thats why the women pass them up
<comment>
Nice goalpost shift
They act desperate because they are desperate
Some just post contact but they never get added
<comment>
Not goalshift at all. They should stop being desperate. They need to have women in and out of there lives cause they have the scarcity mindset
<comment>
Hard to have an abundance mindset when every avenue is a sausagefest
<comment>
Stop worrying about other dudes. How is it not hard to have an abundance? Theres so much ass and titties every where
<comment>
All of which is beyond my reach for countless reasons
Plus I bet you live in a big city
<comment>
Nothing is beyond your reach
Information Age
Access to anyone through your phone
Theres dudes living in a city getting no pussy and dudes who live in buttfuck no where getting pussy. Location doesnt matter. I live in a city but it isnt big. Its economy is bad here
<comment>
There are no women to meet in a 15K town and nowhere to meet them
Internet women live on the other sode of the globe
<comment>
If they "taught you so much" about women and socializing, why are you still posting on 4chan, and on /r9k/ of all placing? Shouldn't you be busy with friends and girls? This mindset man guy sounds like just another PUA / self-help guru telling you the same regurgitated advice, and I can guarantee you without even looking at his channel that he's selling some sort of self-help program. You're honestly pathetic for trying to shill so blantanly.
<comment>
not him but i live in a village with no women, what can i do. by the time i am done with my college and get a job and money to move i'll be in my later 20s. dating apps are the most unnatural shit ever i'm not using them
<comment>
Some people here unironically believe that this will NEVER happen to them.
And those people are right. That webm represents something that the vast majority of men both right now and in the future will never get to experience.
<comment>
You live in Antarctica? Theres absolutely no women around? I call bullshit
<comment>
Im not shilling. You dudes say shilling yet I recommended six dudes and YouTube is free
Friends, most dudes dont rock like how i do. Most dudes arent gonna have your back when shit hits the fan. I had friends before, i was down to help them with anything, they would never do the same for me. Be careful about the company you keep
These dudes arent pick up artists. They teach you game, its mastery of self, how to handle women, watch some of their stuff. Cause you have criticisms yet you havent even seen what they do. This is why you keep failing in multiple places 
You live in a village? Yall dont even eant women then with all these excuses 
The men that wont experience are lames. Seriously, theres so much more women than men yet they couldnt get one bitch out of millions to want to suck their cock or let them fuck. The dudes are at failt. So many dudes are too lazy and weak minded. I had a weak dad, i hated that bitch ass dude
<comment>
theres so much more women than men
???
21 men are born for every 20 women, there are only more women in total because they live longer. In order for every man to get a woman, some young guys would have to be with 90 year olds
<comment>
You live in a village? Yall dont even eant women then with all these excuses
you just dodged my question bro
<comment>
How is living in a village an excuse
<comment>
I didnt dodge anything. I dont believe you live in an actual village. Bro dont tell me your posting from nepal
<comment>
I dont believe that cause i see mostly women everywhere 
Bro is he posting from some amazon tribe or something? Yall always have something to say. Its all excuses
<comment>
These dudes arent pick up artists
They teach you game
how to handle women
that's literally a pick up artist retard.
YouTube is free
oh so they don't have ads on their channel? how generous of them! also funny you fail to mention the mindset man, the guy you mentioned the most, has a website with a "what clients say" section.
client (noun): a person who receives services, esp. from a lawyer or other person who gives advice
again let me reiterate: (You) are a shill
<comment>
Well I see more men in most places except at shit like grocery stores where it's mostly older people
And again you're retarded, villages of 1000 people pr less exist all over the first world, I used to live in one too
You type like a nigger who's never left the city
<comment>
Im not a shill. Its not pick up artist. Pick up artist bullshit women. These guys tell you to be absolutely you. Meaning being yourself to the max
They have programs, yes. You dont have to become a member of their program. Their videos give you plenty of information and their channels are demonitized i think
<comment>
You are getting emotional, yiure in your feminine side. This is a turn off to women
<comment>
This is a turn off to women
imagine taking dating advice from incels
<comment>
lmao no im american but in a town of 1000 ppl
<comment>
Just stating facts
Women only outnumber men in senior populations
Small towns and villages exist, and there are almost no ways to meet women in them
<comment>
Other than that extremely small minority of men that live in secluded areas with absolutely zero area. There isnt anything stopping a dude from meeting women
<comment>
lol nigger mad
<comment>
Yet im not emotionally reacting to anything. So who is actually mad?
<comment>
so what are guys in that situation supposed to do? are they just fucked until they have the means to leave?
<comment>
being yourself to the max
NIGGA WHAT!??!!! you're already yourself, you can't be more of yourself.
You don't have to become a member of their program
you don't have to become a scientology member either, that doesn't mean the guy handing out pamphlets isn't a shill trying to get you to join.
Their videos give you plenty of information
in case you haven't noticed this is how every self-help guru does business: give out bits of free information, then promote their service once the viewer's reeled in. literally no different then how andrew tate, rich cooper, papa swolio, etc, do business. it's shameful because it preys on lonely men who believe this one guy can change their lives. you should be ashamed of yourself because you're shilling this on a board full of lonely men knowing that some of them will take the bait.
<comment>
Y'all niggas think this ain't doable?
Some people here unironically believe that this will NEVER happen to them.
woman using man for social media clout
camera set up
his nervous posture
the way she laughs in his face and goes for the hug to avoid looking at him or kissing him
this screams of stacy using a retard for clout
Taunting retards is hilarious, bro. Good thread.
just go get your skinny blonde e-girl, fat chinese retards, anyone can do it
just look at this 15 second clip where the girl laughs in his face unironically
he kisses her chin
shes still laughing at him
fucking brutal honestly
<comment>
My match rate on tinder is 0.45%. The only humans who intentionally match me are fat black single mothers with shitty jobs.
<comment>
Normies arent interesting at all and are low energy
While this is true, they aren't ugly. Women only care about looks and height.
<comment>
this screams of stacy using a retard for clout
fuck this hurts so much. i was a retard in hs and fell for a stacy when i was out of my league. she always took pics of me for snapchat (picrel is one of them) and it was only later on that i realized she was mocking me.
<comment>
Real life completely disproves that
<comment>
thats not a stacy u nigger
<comment>
compared to the other girls in my school (mostly nogs and trailer trash) she was.
<comment>
Man, you're disconnected from reality. Zoomerdoom
<comment>
fuck this hurts so much.
kek
There was this actual rich blonde stacy I grew up with. The first time we met, in grade 1, this bitch just kicks me in the balls. In grade 8 she gets all flirty and tries pretending she liked me but I always ignored her or pretended like I didn't know she was flirting. I think she was just low-key turbo-autist but she was rich and looked normal so she could mask easy. She would get so frustrated because I would talk to all of the other girls normally, but low-key reverse-mock her.
One day I tell her, in front of a ton of people eating lunch, that she only talks to me when she wants something. She wanted some of my pizza and a sip of my coke. I told her to beat it and gave some to everyone else. Fuck she was embarrassed as shit.
Years later she had a birthday party at her parents farm and I got absolutely blackout drunk. The look of disgust on her face is one of the few things I remember. I woke up in her pool house on a half inflated air mattress. No regrets. Fuck that bitch kek.
<comment>
disconnected from reality.
lol, sure anon, im the one who's disconnected. Also, not a zoomer.
<comment>
Well enjoy being borderline delusional. The woman in the OP was clearly not derisively laughing in his face or avoiding other kinds of physical intimacy, but keep theorizing.
<comment>
The first time we met, in grade 1, this bitch just kicks me in the balls
stopped reading there. 2/10 do better
<comment>
noooo it can't be real
i'm not gonna read it and tell you i didnt read it because im insecure about reality so everything i read must be a fake larp by a delusional idiot
not like this fake video with a greasy meth addicted female and a fat chink
watch the video, retard, she literally laughs at him. She's nervously propped up on her toes with her waste as far back as possible so she can hop off.
I bet he paid for this clip to "mog" his friends.
Retards.
<comment>
What so you can orbit a girl who talks to 100 men for nitro skins Uber eats etc?
<comment>
what does that have to do with your story being made-up?
<comment>
 The first time we met, in grade 1, this bitch just kicks me in the balls.
Retard. This is how elementary school girls flirt. Yes it's retarded but all the popular dudes at my school would get hit in the balls by the popular girls constantly. I was insanely jealous because I'm a masochist and have always been super into ballbusting but no girls ever did it to me even tho it was an epidemic at my school because I was a weirdo/loner/loser. I'd even leave myself vulnerable with my legs wider than usual hoping they would take the bait but no girls ever did. Was truly a nightmare watching so many other dudes live my dream every day.
<comment>
I already watched the video and your perception of the events that transpired is delusional. You betting that he paid for the clip and calling me a retard means nothing. Relax, anon.
<comment>
i should've known it was a fetish post. kys degenerate coomer
<comment>
They literally live together. They're a couple. You think she is doing this ironically? If you're trolling you're doing a good job, if you truly believe what you're typing you're sick and probably beyond help.
<comment>
They literally live together. 
They're a couple.
its true i live with them too.
no one ever lies on the internet.
y..you're wrong
watch again, bucko
This is how elementary school girls flirt
I know, anon, did you miss the part where she is a turbo-autist?
what does that have to do with your story being made-up?
you can't just have normal elementary school interactions and share them on the internet 30 years later
anon, I literally do not care about your opinions
<comment>
You think she is doing this ironically
Nta, but she's doing this disingenuously. She's a) virtue signaling how she's dating someone who's out of his league, and b) signaling for more attractive males to hit her up and compete for her
<comment>
signaling for more attractive males to hit her up and compete for her
these autists wouldn't know what a genuine relationship looks like if they were in one. They have no reference point outside of anime.
This is so fake it hurts. I bet she is milking him for every dollar she can get. Woman are ruthless.
<comment>
noooo its real and genuine and she loves him
ok, here's the secret bros. You know it's fake because she's pretending to be happy. People don't act like this IRL. kek
you will never have this because it isn't real. No one has this. Trust me bros, you don't even want this. Find a girl that respects space and boundaries. Fuck this clingy social media grubbing bullshit.
<comment>
this. also, dating girls that are social-media addicts is asking for heartbreak. if they crave attention and validation that badly then it'll literally take no effort for another guy to make her feel special.
<comment>
Not only do they not believe it'll happen to them, half the people in this thread have gaslit themselves into believing it isn't even happening to the man in the video. This board really is pathetic. I can sympathize with a lot of the cope perspectives on here because I used to feel angry and rejected too but it's so gross to witness how aggressively a lot of these people don't want to get better.
<comment>
Yeah. I was the one trying to help them earlier. Theyre infected with a Mind virus
<comment>
gaslit themselves into believing it isn't even happening to the man in the video
lol. anon we are speaking from experience. It's painfully obvious that you have had minimal interactions with human females outside of your family or professional relationships.
You know how you can "spot" an autist by the way they act and move? After a while you learn to recognize difffernet types of woman, as well. This bitch is a typical narcissistic social media addict, but she's also lazy and probably autistic, too.
She's too lazy to wash her hair (or her vag) so she cozies up to beta-chang till some slightly better opportunity comes knocking.
You haven't honestly deluded yourself into believing that this was her first choice? Or he has some kind of amazing personalty when he isn't eating dumplings and playing dota?
Grow up, retard.
<comment>
mind virus
listen here, chang, this thread is almost as pathetic as your little tiny chinese peepee.
china has to be the most fucking pathetic group of retards on the planet. Probably worse than indians or niggers, unironically.
<comment>
how aggressively a lot of these people don't want to get better
it's funny because you've never been in a relationship before and you're arguing with people that actually do have sex IRL
<comment>
True. It is a little saddening to see these people so convinced that OP's video is an impossibility, but there's nothing that can be done. Except another psyop, because they're clearly very susceptible to those.
<comment>
My friend failed
Your point?
<comment>
Some people here unironically believe that this will NEVER happen to them.
Good. We need less people taking the 3DPDpill, not more.
<comment>
Try them all. It's a number's game
I am anon. No results ever. And the people on it are the most dogshit vapid people i've ever seen. Carbon copies of eachother, caked in makeup, fake tans, and the 1000 cock stare. 
I literally had actual success trawling Omegle and /soc/ than I did using 7 different dating apps
<comment>
yes just get back in that hamster wheel goy
<comment>
that stare at 11 seconds
What did she mean by this?
<comment>
is that monitor 3d? why?
<comment>
Fuck off, Ive been doing this for years and women dont even message back. They want nothing to do with me.
<comment>
it's the signal that she's available for dick while living off this guy's money
another red flag (or green light, depending on who you are) is when they upload selfies where the boyfriend is the one leaning in, kissing her etc while she smiles straight into the camera
<comment>
i prefer femboys sorry anon
<comment>
High chance? what the heck have you been smoking. Possible yes but high chance lmao
<comment>
For you? Grindr.

Fake video. 
No it's not 
Stop being a fuckwad who gaslights people.

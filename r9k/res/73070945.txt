I don't see the point in having a large number of friends or even multiple friends. Especially not in the day and age of cancel culture where all it takes is one bad rumor or video of you saying the no-no word to make you unemployable for life. This is why I have always had only one friend who also has me as their only friend since kindergarten. It is simply unsafe to talk to way too many people since all normalfags do is gossip. A common trend I have noticed amongst normie men is they do not have friends but acquaintances associated with a particular activity. For example "drinking buddies" or people they play sports with. With the exception of those in the military, males just do not seem to value their same-sex brethren for anything other than what they do in the moment. Exclusivity in friendships solves these issues entirely which is why I prefer them when possible.
nb4 that's gay/boring/embarassing etc.
If you genuinely think that it probably means you have a low IQ, ADHD or both.

nothing wrong with it, i prefer it that way as well. but for me it has always felt strange to tell/show things to multiple people or pick who i ask to do something with etc. why have more friends when one friend do trick

I'm sorry you're in denial about your homosexuality.

Homosexual men are quite the opposite. They literally have sex with thousands of random men through the course of their lifetime. Meanwhile normie men have hundreds of "friends" they don't care about. Now who is more akin to the behavior of real homosexuals?

Having friends seems cool. Back when I had a job I used to talk about cooking with a couple people but that was as far as anything ever went. I can't even find friends on discord because everyone is either batshit crazy or batshit crazy+underage. No interest in being friends with either. Mean too. At least people here are mostly kindhearted.

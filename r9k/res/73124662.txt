get on blind dating site
only allowed to know name, height, and age
no pictures allowed, the above must be verified, descriptions of body type, facial features, ethnicity, etc are filtered out
extensive personality test and plenty of good prompts for conversation
meet someone
the algorithm works - they're everything you wanted
even interested in the niche stuff you like
you talk for weeks without missing a beat
feels like you two know are meant for each other
finally decide to meet in person
put on your best outfit and show up a little early
you see the door open and someone comes up to you, introducing themselves
oh fuck they're ____________
What's your dealbreaker in this scenario? Try to keep it to one.

I wear XS clothes which is pretty much size 0, but Imo that's too skinny, I basically don't have breasts because of it.

I'm >>73124742 btw , not the "size 0" guy. Imo the second from the left is the last stop, the final destination, the furthest I'll go etc. The one completely to the left is therefore fat and will be rejected by chad left and right.

OP here
It don't, but I imagine it will someday with the popularity of shows like Love Is Blind.

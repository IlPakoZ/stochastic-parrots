Why can't I escape being shat on by peers? I want to hang out with similar minded outcasts but everywhere I turn it seems that the people turn on me eventually for being too much of a loser. I've yet to meet someone I can actually relate to in this factor. the more I dwell on it the more frustrated I get. am I just meant to isolate? I can't even isolate effectively anymore, escapism doesn't work like it used to. 
I refuse to change or 'better' myself.
There is no solution to this problem

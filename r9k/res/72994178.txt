I am an incel with respect to Dungeons and Dragons. I've always wanted to play, but have never had anyone to play with. It seems like a really fun game, exactly up my alley. I like to think of myself as a creative person, I love numbers and calculating, I love fantasy settings, I love pretending like I'm somewhere else. Too bad it was never meant to happen.
I've tried to hint and ask friends if I can join, but the answer is always the same-- no, they're in the middle of a campaign. I've stopped asking to play when I hear that someone's going to do DnD, and instead just resent the person talking. I can't talk about how big of a deal this is to me, or people will realize I've gone off the deep end. What stops me from ranting and raving about this is a glimmer of hope that perhaps if I just appear normal enough, I'll get to play.
In addition to feeling envious, I feel confused. Why me, of all people? Why have I not been able to play? Isn't it popular among nerds? I'm definitely an outcast from regular society, but it seems I'm an outcast from outcasts. Anytime I hear about the game I'm reminded of this. Every single time it's mentioned I feel worse about the whole deal.
If the stars do ever align and I somehow get the opportunity to play, I'm skeptical that this will mark my salvation. I've hated DnD and everyone who plays it for long enough that I probably won't be able to enjoy it. I'll be in a room full of the people who used to cast me aside, and I don't know if I can just forget that they took me in out of pity or whatever. I'm not going to degrade myself by barking like a dog to be let into the group-- I'm an adult human being, goddammit! I have more dignity than that! If they're going to cast me aside then why should I ever want to join them again!
Fucking shit. I hate this and I hate my life and I hate that I'm thinking about this.

Did you try asking your friends to let you know if any campaigns start up. I'm literally doing two campaigns at once, you just gotta find people who are hosting and ask them. There are some games where the host would be fine letting you join mid campaign

Same here. I am too big of a friendless loser for even dungeons and dragons.

I have asked them, but they always seem to conveniently 'forget' and then... BOOM! "We're in the middle of a campaign, so it would be awkward, you know."

If you're autistic enough, you basically need the luck to have someone close to you be a dm and then offer you to join their game.
I play irl thanks to my roommate, but I notice that once I started mentioning playing dnd to new people I meet (mostly when trying out new university clubs), lots of people and even women respond that they play as well. so it's not as rare as it might feel like.
if you can't find an "in", I recommend finding discord groups and playing online. if you don't want that, just accept that you didn't have luck when it comes to this. sorry. 
i also want to mention that most dm's are used to players being annoying and dropping out mid-campaign, or NEVER fucking having the time to play despite joining the campaign, and then the dm constantly having to reschedule because of annoying players who don't have time. this especially is why dm's might be aloof when it comes to new players joining their games. annoying players tend to be the norm, and they can't help but assume that you will be like that too.

Why can't incels do this when it comes to girls? There's nothing wrong with striking out, and it's certainly not worth filling online boards with hateful venom over.
<comment>
because with girls it's also about the acceptance of other men. weak men like incels are homosexuals who aim to get "presentable" women who they can show off so that they can get respect from other men.

It can't be this, or incels would sperg out about things that earn the respect of other men, like extreme sports. In reality, most of them are 100% fine with every other male on the planet hating them or even with just outright killing them off so long they get the pussy they feel entitled to.

it's also about wanting to "feel like a man", and seeing having a woman as a necessary component of that. but mostly it's about being gay.

Absolutely love fantasy stuff
Too stupid for dnd
What did the Lord and creator mean by this?

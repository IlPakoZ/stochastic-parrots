ok so one day i was eating a banana right. and so i ate the whole thing but i was too lazy to get up, so i just threw the peel far away on the ground. anyways a few hours of gaming later i finally get up, and we both know that when you sit for too long and get up, your legs are weak. so im walking with weak legs and my foot lands on the banana peel, I SLIP ON IT AND FALL ON MY FACE. isnt that so crazy

anyone wanna talk about stupid shit ?
yesterday I ate an apple. Had been months since I had any fruit. Today, first thing in the morning I went pooping. I might eat more fruits now.
stupid shit like what? i am a stupid shit, can i talk about myself?
anon discovers fiber for the first time
yea anything just talk to me im desperate
desperate for what, anon? 
did something bad happen? i think it would be better if you talked about it, i won't make you feel any better talking about myself
no seriously, please talk about yourself n say some goofy shit n make me laugh. a distraction would be really fuckin nice right now
ok so one day i was eating a banana right. and so i ate the whole thing but i was too lazy to get up, so i just threw the peel far away on the ground. anyways a few hours of gaming later i finally get up, and we both know that when you sit for too long and get up, your legs are weak. so im walking with weak legs and my foot lands on the banana peel, I SLIP ON IT AND FALL ON MY FACE. isnt that so crazy
i know youre bullshitting but i still giggled so thanks
i swear to god it's true i've never lied in my life
god isnt real, therefore u lie.
You are alone now. Deal with yourself.
this happened to me, but with a mango peel
craaaazy
I had a warm waffle today, It was nice. I think rain is soothing. What's your favorite letter in the alphabet?

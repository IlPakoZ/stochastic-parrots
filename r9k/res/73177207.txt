If you have autism please do yourself a favor and commit suicide. Life is simply not worth living with this condition no matter how often propaganda says otherwise. It is truly a fate worse than death by all metrics.
nb4 b-b-bu-bu-but I am a software dev with a wife and kids who makes 200k/year!1!! Having asperger's is not that bad! 
Let me tell you this, if you are "successful" as an autist your situation is fleeting. All it takes is one social mistake to cause your perfect life to start crumbling down resulting in an unstoppable downward spiral into alcoholism and homelessness. At this point your problems will become insurmountable because there is literally no one able or willing to help you including yourself. The general suffering in life for even the most successful and genetically gifted is far below that of the average homeless neurotypical.
I have aspergers but wont kill myself because I still have a lot to give and many people are nice to me despite my issue
I even have a job in IT.
I don't think there is any concrete proof that Einstein or Tesla were spergs. Tesla was definitely some kind of schizo though.
Women with autism/aspergers are awesome tho
If you are a demoralization poster please do yourself a favor and commit suicide.
"Tough love" beratement and self-improvement cult posting is more demoralizing than "demoralization" threads, honestly.
I don't need dudebros telling me to put myself through all sorts of bullshit and suffering just to have a chance of obtaining the scraps of what normal people get naturally, I need to finally give up.
Ever considered fighting back against these sort of "people"? You don't have to tolerate them. It's not like you have anything to lose anyways.

i binge a lot of youtube. i'm noticing a lot of these youtubers make an error in their speech, using the word "whenever" in stead of "when" for some reason. the most egregious offender is wendigoon. i thought it was just his quirk, but i have all of a sudden noticed several other youtubers saying "whenever" incorrectly, just in the past few days
what the fuck is happening?

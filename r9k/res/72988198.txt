Here here. Quit my last job which was a 12 hour shift manufacturing job. Hard to find anything right now. Even applying to fast food places and restaurants with zero success. 
A lot harder to find a job now than it was just a year ago.

NEETed for 17 out of 18 years. My year out was a finance apprenticeship, which I passed, but it became a living hell. TFW it exposed me as an unemployable aspie. Now thanks to outsourcing gutting the Western economy, leaving only the shit underpaid service jobs that are too hellish for me to survive in, I am fully Black Pilled on ever wage-cucking again. Now trying to get an autism diagnosis, so I can be essentially medically retired and not have to go through hell to get my pittance of 'bux. I fucking pray that UBI happens in my non-burgerland country.

I've been pushing trolleys for 7 years. If it wasn't for this job I would've been NEET this whole time 100%

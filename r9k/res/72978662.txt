Would you refuse to date a woman if she complained on the Internet in her free time, felt entitled to sex, was narcissistic, had no confidence, and hated men? No. You wouldn't. So why do we pretend the opposite is true?

"Complaining on the Internet" doesn't and never has had anything to do with people getting laid. That's just some cope shit reddit and inceltears came up with to justify the just world hypothesis.

Yes. Why wouldn't I date her? We both would complain on the internet, she wants to have lots of sex with me, thinks she's hot shit, has no confidence and hates men(other than me). Sounds perfect actually.

No. You wouldn't

Foids will never experience love and I'm here for it. Just despair until they reach robot levels.

was narcissistic, had no confidence
These are fine. The only mental problems that are legit deal breakers are psychopathy and BPD.
she complained on the Internet in her free time, 
hated men
Don't care. She's entitled to her opinions.
felt entitled to sex
This is a positive

complained on the Internet in her free time
Why would this be a bad thing?
felt entitled to sex
If she was a virgin before but felt entitled to having sex with me for being her bf that would be fine.
was narcissistic
Depends how narcissistic and how it manifests.
had no confidence
No man has ever cared about this. Shy girls are cute and men like them.
hated men
As long as she doesn't hate me and our children I don't care.

All women complain on the internet. All women feel entitled to sex. All women are narcissists. (And usually solipsists.) I find a lack of confidence attractive in a woman.
So basically you're asking me if I would date a woman who hates men. Is she cute? My answer depends on whether she is cute.
<comment>
Yes I would so long as she was mildy attractive.
100% would if she looked like pic related.

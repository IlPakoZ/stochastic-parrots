day 99 of manifesting a lesbian bff who will save me by forcing me to talk about my feelings.
I had one, once upon a time
neither of us really saved the other, except to the extent that you count "neither of us committed suicide"
I do still miss her badly though
Hello I am a lesbian looking for friends!
Wait a sec, I just remembered I had one too for a short while. I miss her too. Well more like I miss the times I spent hanging out with her.
Do you live in Australia? Someone online will not be able to save me.
Sorry I dont :(
I hope I am able to spread the message that lesbians are the only type of people that can save us by forcing us to talk about our feelings.
No need to be sorry, for one day she will knock on my door. Go out and live a good life for now

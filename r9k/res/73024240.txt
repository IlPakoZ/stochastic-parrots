day 99 of manifesting a lesbian bff who will save me by forcing me to talk about my feelings.
<comment>
I had one, once upon a time
neither of us really saved the other, except to the extent that you count "neither of us committed suicide"
I do still miss her badly though

Hello I am a lesbian looking for friends!

Wait a sec, I just remembered I had one too for a short while. I miss her too. Well more like I miss the times I spent hanging out with her.

Do you live in Australia? Someone online will not be able to save me.

Sorry I dont :(

I hope I am able to spread the message that lesbians are the only type of people that can save us by forcing us to talk about our feelings.

No need to be sorry, for one day she will knock on my door. Go out and live a good life for now

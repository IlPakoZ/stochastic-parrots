dont purge or fast it doesnt work, walking is easier than you think. walk 5 km daily and you can allow yourself to eat and personally substituting food with energy drinks (sugar free) helps great with my cravings, it disappears. if you ever find yourself craving a lot of food you can also try and find low cal like powder substituted foods typically soup etc
intermittent fasting is the way to go, fast one day or limit your calorie intake but eat protein drink water then you can allow yourself to eat something more unhealthy another day, if you 100% fast your body will believe you are starving and try to regain weight on its own and even if you go down to your gw by only fasting it will go up really quickly once you eat normally again

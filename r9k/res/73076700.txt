still remember the tomoko vs moonman rap threads
each poster coming up with more elaborate rhymes and ways to diss each other with every continuing thread
tomoko would start the threads, moonman would barge in and insult tomoko in bars, praising the white race
tomoko would rap back in the following post, with the two going back and forth
both posters got better and more creative with their rhyme schemes
reading it over in the archives. that was something special. fuck I miss the OC days of r9k. they have long left this shithole behind but I would pay real money to see entertaining shit like that on this board again.

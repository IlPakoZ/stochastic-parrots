B is such a ludicrous choice that I'm tempted to take it just because I know no sane human would.

Torture is a deal breaker, otherwise I might

10 billion genetic clones of me is a LOT of autism

I don't see the appeal of B. As for A, most people don't plan on having that many children anyway so it's just free money.

button B starring nicolas cage

Why the actual fuck would you EVER want to choose B?
<comment>
To be remembered and reviled.

Without the torture I would consider choosing B just for the lulz.
I read a short story once where an autistic genius had developed a tailored virus that went out into the world and impregnated a high percentage of all fertile females with a clone of himself. So hundreds of millions of copies of him had been born 9 months later.
He did this because he never had any friends, and assumed his clones would all be friends with each other. The story is about a group of the clones 10-13 years later who are in a special school together...and aren't friends.
I'd pull this just to laugh when all the white baby boys start being born in China and Africa. BLEACHED, motherfuckers!

Sure being Genghis Khan would be cool and all, but if you have $10M you can definitely get laid and 10 children will be more than enough.

B
i want to be in history books. nothing dared nothing gained
<comment>
B
Hope the torture isn't too long
<comment>
Can someone explain the tortured to death part to me? I don't understand how that makes any sense in the context of the question. I'd get it if it was like , "you can never earn more than 1 million dollars in your life time." but being tortured to death seems completely out of left field.
<comment>
How is this even a question? Who came up with this shit?
<comment>
I think the person who wrote the question thinks too many people will choose B if nothing bad happens to you if you do it.
I think they dramatically underestimate how many people want $10 million dollars, but that's just me.

thank you for accelerating inbreeding retards
I choose A) it's by far smarter.

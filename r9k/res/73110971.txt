Fuck Asuka
Who cares. Cartoons not gonna fuck you pedo
in the most literal sense Rei is an npc. she also definitely acts like an npc throughout the whole show. Asuka is a real girl who has real emotions. she is also hotter
Rei literally has no personality
Its cause she thinks and is intrinsic in nature. Normies only seek the extrinsic. How a person reacts to stimuli, that is how they define a person in complete form
Rei literally does all of Gendos apart from during EoE. She has no hobbies, no interests, no personality because she is a fucked up science experiment schizoid. Her existence is as a tool for NERV. The writers even forgot about what to do with her, which is why she has so little a role in the middle of the show. It was supposed to show how the submissive kuudere ideal Japanese housewife is actually a boring vacuous person, whose mental processes involve the most basic existential questions. Of course this message went way over the heads of the otakus.
Asuka is a normalfag, but Rei is a literal NPC
Pretty sure she reads regularly
anon I've wanted to fuck Asuka for a long time
The only book I remember seeing her read was a textbook in episode 9. She is commanded to get passing grades so she reads textbooks.
She has books in her room
kek, no 
Everything in your picrel only applies to her pre depression 
The whole thing with asuka is that she really wants to be an NPC but just can't 
End of eva literally gives her the choice to join the mass and she decides not to
This doesn't make Rei an npc either though
Their characters have a clear symmetry with Ritsuko and Misato (you know which is which based on who they have a crush on) 
Neither Ritsuko or Misato are normies no matter how hard they try to be 
Misato uses her loud mouth to try and hide just how sad and insecure she is whilst Ritsuko doesn't with endless moral panic, inner monologue and science 
Both of them are copes, accept it
probably NPC books like twilight
Forgot to add that I also believe that Ritsuko is best girl and anyone who thinks otherwise should die
btw, ive been seeing rei vs asuka threads since like 2005 or something. this shit was always on 4chan, even on /b/, back then. i swear to god, this debate is perhaps the longest debate 4chan has had. its why i even watched eva in 2009, because so many people wouldnt shut the fuck up about it
and rei wins without fucking question
asuka is SHIT
asuka is absolute garbage, i hate that worthless bpd normie whore
rei is far and away the best girl
people who like asuka are nasty normie femdom-liking cuckolds and simps
rei is, without a doubt, best girl
lemme just check those numbers pls
the Rei you like exists only in your head. In reality she`s a souless shit
kek, lies 
best girl is Ritsuko and if we include males then it's kawarou closely followed by shinji himself 
You've deluded yourself into believing that rei is best girl by limiting your options to the two main camps that you see in the debates
Well, misato is actually the best so
Rei dies and turns into fanta and Asuka gets a husband and lives happily ever after.
Proof being a NPC is a good thing.
As if that isn't the case with majority if not all of love men feel for women.
brutal blackpill but also that doesn't really add much to the discussion at hand so kys 
Rei bites the dust
I'm more of a Misato lover
The point of the show is that despite our imperfections, it makes us who we are. But because of that, the producers made the flaws of the characters very overexaggerated. There is no best girl, they're all shit. Go watch a better anime
loud, pedo girl is best girl 
I'm more of a Ritsuko lover 
Just die
I used to love asuka now I hate all bpd girls even 2d ones
This meme only makes sense because we never got to see what made Asuka reject Instrumentality. We only saw what happened to Shinji, her character was missing a lot of context.
least retarded reifag
Common neurotypical W
Rei sisters...
Since you continue to insist
yeah, no
It's canon that she's one of Gendo's side hoes.
Do women even think? I don't think they have the capability to self-reflect without the influence of others. it's a nice fantasy but it doesn't exist IMO.
They can only use their intelligence to manipulate men.
Manipulation is... LE BAD
That's not how it works. Women gain outside influence from others and apply it to their relationships and life. It's other men that manipulate - not the woman. 
You need to make it clear that she cannot have male friends or actively have conversations with them from the beginning. Then you can work from there.
MANIPULATION IS...
LE BAD
not wanting to be manipulated is heckin slave morality

To this day Ritsuko is the only "femcel" to make it
Ritsuko covers the basis of all 3 eva chicks (it just wasn't explored well in the show) 
Sexy bod that is at the cusp of milfmaxxing and has cool interests
She is literally both my and your dream girl, only ruined by the fact that her mom was a dirty whore 
She's a metal bitch (literally Balalaika from black lagoon but cooler) I think it would be best if you realized this
True, but I'm not into bleached hair.
Only fair argument against Ritsuko ever 
If her mom's hair was naturally red then she really missed out on what must be one of the rarest jap hair colours

Anyone here /asexual/? I went asexual for some reason after i had sex with 35+ different girls, now I can't even coom. No it's not meds, i honestly can't get horny no matter how hard i try. On the other hand, it feels liberating because you have no desire to have sex and don't relate with sex relevant problems.

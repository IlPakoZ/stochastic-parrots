Yo, get go,
You already knew from the get go,
All these bitches let go,
letting themselves go,
Oh no,
You wanna know something, 
I already did this,
Miss me with that shit like it's Christmas,
Hit me with that fist like you're listless, 
Or Sonny Liston with a bad limp,
You wristless, 
I'm mad that I'm less than average,
Smoking cabbage,
(yeah right)
I wish,
(The infamous reject,)
All I get is some swishers or backwoods,
Not even in the projects,
but they think I'm hood,
Am I unique,
Let's seek to speak with clear speech,
Since there are billions it'd be a hard feat,
But it's possible that you haven't met,
Someone like me,
It may not be for who or what I am,
but what was done to me,
Possibly a consideration you see,
A recommendation from the elite,
Rejected,
And some can't handle it with ease,
I'm a beast, a GOAT, a Legend, a feast
a banquet, 
all you can eat for free,
but don't stress,
It's usually the best that give it up,
and have to settle for less,
on a never ending quest, 
to be accepted by the Best,
and embraced as His guest, 
CHEECH

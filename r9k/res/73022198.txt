Do any anons have OCD or similar symptoms, how about family members you know?
my big brother has OCD, he struggles with a lot of things but has gotten a little better. i'm proud of him.
yes
doing many simple tasks is a pain 
nearly every time i brush my teeth they bleed because i try to get it right
i constantly get disturbing and vivid gruesome images in my mind 
my mind constantly makes random bets like "if you touch this thing before this song reaches this certain time (random bad thing) will happen". it's hard for me to make decisions and write messages because i worry about using the "right" words or characters and often fear something bad happening if i don't. people think it's a meme disorder but the suicide rate is high and there is a documentary about it that was really dark. many of the people in the documentary had been hospitalized multiple times and/or still had frequent symptoms despite being on medication. link:

it's a nightmare. I'm never relaxed. it got much worse in late 2020 and it hasn't gotten much better since. lately it's been a bit better though, but it's still frequent enough to make daily tasks exhausting. the only thing that significantly helped me besides medications was believing that my actions ultimately won't change the outcome of things, in other words, trying to force myself to believe in fate. the fear still overwhelmed me though. i definitely believe this and other mental illnesses like schizophrenia are caused by ghosts / demons. it makes sense to me especially considering that one of the symptoms of schizophrenia is tactile hallucinations, feeling like something is touching you even if there isn't anything visible to other people that is touching you.

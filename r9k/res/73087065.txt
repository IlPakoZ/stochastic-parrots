To Women,
I resent you. You've been pretty free, blunt and clear about how you feel about men. If you have ever been upset by men making "generalizations" about women, you're an obnoxious hypocrite. You're way worse than you think you are. And if you were treated the way you treat others, and you really had people with authority breathing down your back instead of validating you all the time: you'd be killing yourself, and not the fake attention whore suicides either.
-Anon,

Unreasonable.
That's what describes all of you.
Fuck all compromise.

Dear anon,
How have you been? Are you reading any interesting books? For a while I've wondered if you hate women so much that you'd never, ever want to be in a relationship with one or if you're just waiting to meet one who you like. Do you see yourself getting married and growing old with someone or are you okay being single?

The last book i read has been a book in business accounting, before that it was a book on trading options
Last lit novel i read was wuthering heights, are you interested in chatting about any of these?

I don't hate women in the way i believe you think of it. I treat women fairly well, at least I think. I just vent on the internet about things that bother me about them. I'd be fine dating a woman who i thought cared for me.

I don't think too hard of it. As much as many people truly want to blame me for every deprivation in my life: It is something out of my locus of control. I will simply accept life as it comes to me. At present I only dream of building up some wealth, maybe making a small business and building a charity fund in my old age if i ever achieve significant wealth. I'm not certain that my life includes a partner. And the older i get, the more cynical and suspicious of one I think i'm going to be, and the less i'm going to enjoy their company: the more i feel used.

The Joshua Graham one sounds so real! Wow. Honestly, I haven't read many books recently, but I would love to hear your thoughts on Wuthering Heights. What did you like most about it? Would you recommend it? Do you think it deserves to be as famous as it is?

I figured as much :) This seems to be the best way to go about that sort of thing. Do you apply that thinking to other areas of your life as well? It can be really hard for me to go with the flow sometimes - I start to feel like I can only be happy if everything is a certain way. I don't really know what causes me to think that way.
Dear anon,
I forgive you! You forgetting your letter format almost feels like a fourth wall break. Have a song! You've probably heard this before but I think it's great and I couldn't think of a better thing to share.

My week has been well :) Not much has happened, but the weather is getting nicer here. I think I may postpone my gf search for a while so that I can enjoy the sunshine.

Oops, I almost forgot to thank you for introducing me to that band - I can't believe I hadn't heard of them before, they're great. I always like the music you post on here.

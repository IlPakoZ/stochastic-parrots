I just had a thought what if we created a dark brotherhood irl where we secretly coordinate the assassination of trannies. Would anyone be interested in that?

Why would we hurt people when we can do calisthenics and mog everyone with our aesthetics
<comment>
killing people who just kill themselves anyway
Pretty pointless for something so heinous.

What is with you fbi niggers on here. why is the frog's eye slightly fucked up? stupid nigger

good luck organizing a bunch of internet schizos into a coherent group of assassins. even if you form a group without being infiltrated someone is going to get caught alive and rat out the group when facing life in prison. committing crime with others is begging for being ratted out.

Seems like a wasted effort, they'll just assassinate themselves soon enough anyway.

This is why you make being invited incredibly exclusive and actually making it into the circle incredible difficult. Even most fed niggers would probably crumble if they had to cut out one of their eyes just for a chance to be accepted.

I have 0 problem with transgender people. It's mainstream media and politics that are shoving them in front of the camera. The real enemy is the media and big business. They want us all to hate each other bc then we are ez to read and control

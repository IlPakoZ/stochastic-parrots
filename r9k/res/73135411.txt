At least I didn't try hard enough.
We'r blinded by the injustices of the world, which are all valid btw, and forget that in order to have anything massive amount of time and effort is required. Browsing tinder leftovers I simply come to a realization that i'm the male equivalent of those shallow, empty profiles. If you want things from other people you need to find and fulfill others people needs. Only then then will share value or be your friends. Provide value before you can't expect to receive any from anybody. 
True some people have it easier but we can't focus on that because we can't take responsibility in control things in the matter.
I think some of are missing basic fundamental things of how the world works for whatever reason it may be.

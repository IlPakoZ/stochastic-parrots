my best friend just lost his virginity in a hookup with a hoe and im so disappointed in him
he had every opportunity to get a girlfriend and do it right but no, he threw that away to fuck a drugged out hoe
neither of them came either

i wanna lose my virginity in a hookup i just want a woman who doesnt think she should walk me through fifty thousand shit tests and half of my salary for regular sex
<comment>
This is the objectively correct way to do it. Good sex takes practice and romanticizing the first time as some starry-eyed mystical experience is going to lead to disappointment for like 95 percent of people.
If anyone manages to have even a slightly good time with it, that's a W. Onto the next time, where hopefully you'll be a bit less awkward and fumbly.

This is more tricks by women to stop guys paying for women to lose their virginity , women hate that guys can buy sex
<comment>
100% correct sir
<comment>
that's too funny I have a friend who semi ghosted me for a while after I told him I fucked a prostitute
like him I can probably get a girlfriend if I tried, but nah lol I did that instead
I couldn't come fucking her so I had to jack myself off to finish
<comment>
why would you PAY for bad sex when you could've had sex for free
ill never understand you people
<comment>
I have never once in my life been able to have sex with a woman for free. A couple of equally gross and desperate men, sure, women, no.
<comment>
Been there bro
t. allowed himself to be groomed by a 15-years-older man on the promise that he as a fag had a lot of faghag friends he could introduce me to
Fuck I was desperate back then

Absolute saddest way to be like "Yeah I'm definitely bisexual" lmao because I'm kneeling there like "Well this is a fat, balding, cigarette-smelling construction worker who's old enough to be my dad but I'll be damned if the cock in my mouth isn't getting me hard anyways".
To be slightly fair to the dude, he had one redeeming feature and that was in fact that he was packing a thick 7-ish inches.

this is such a virgin way to view sex,you think sex is like in the pornos where you have to have crazy stamina and do all sorts of crazy movements for half an hour for it to be enjoyable,hopefully one day you will be proven wrong trough experience
<comment>
neither of them came either
I could understand her not being able to cum, but him? How? Does he have massive ED or something?
<comment>
This is a "I have never made a woman have a non-faked orgasm" way to view sex. 
Did I say that oh it's like a porno and you need to last forever and do crazy movements? No, I said good sex takes practice - which 95 percent of people would agree with if you asked them. Making most women cum with the equipment most men are packing involves quite a bit more than just jackhammering away, 
and practice helps with the confidence, communication skills and presence of mind to make that happen.

That's mindy vega I used to think she was so hot
<comment>
I had to jack myself off for a pretty ludicrous amount of time to finish the first time I got some pussy, and it's not like it didn't feel good or I wasn't attracted to her. Constant fapping to porn can do a real number.
<comment>
when you do it with someone you love for the first time its not about cooming or muh dick,specially if the other person is also a virgin with no previous experience,we humans are designed to feel pleasure from it of course there are ways to make it better after the initial charm wears off but you dont need to go to a sex school or whatever
<comment>
Did I say "sex school", retard? No. Did I ever say "it's not good to feel good at all the first time"? No. 
What I said is "it's not going to be good" - meaning that it's likely to be awkward, clumsy, the girl might not finish and it's overall not likely to be all that much better than jacking off.

Awww is baby gunna cry over a little bit of confrontation? Fragile ego pleb
<comment>
Retard says something retarded, gets called a retard, accuses interlocutor of crying. Many such cases!
<comment>
I'm not even the guy you were responding to, that's how easily deceived and myopic you are all due your fragile ego haha
<comment>
You're the living embodiment of the "Isn't there someone you forgot to ask?" meme, congratulations on being such an obtuse faggot.
<comment>
Retard gets involved in discussion he had no part in, randomly accuses someone of crying. Fewer, but also many such cases!

 making sacrifices and committing for a whore that is just better at hiding it
Most women are soulless sluts, it's just a matter of how much effort they put in hiding it (this is one of the few valuable pieces of info you get by befriending women).
The real modern strategy is to satisfy the need of companionship with friends, family and some form of escapism, while satisfying your sexual needs with casual sex (hook ups or prostitutes will do the job).
Don't put broken toys on pedestals anon...because you are the one that it's going to get hurt once you realize that the kind of girl you would love only exists inside your head.

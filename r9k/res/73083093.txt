Few things irritate me as much as south asians and arabs pretending they're oppressed in the west. Indians are literally the highest earning ethnicity in America. Paks and pajeets infest several neighborhoods in the US and Canada. Majority of them are upper class, well off suburbanites. The audacity of these pricks to whine about white supremacy when they live better than most whites in the west.
At least with blacks and hispanics, I kinda get it. They're poor, cheap labor, the bad minorities, etc. But asians in general pretending they struggle in america is lure cringe. No pajeet, you are not a victim of white supremacy, you are a suburban middle class fuckboy who desperately wanta to blend in with blacks so you can attain an ounce of their "cool" factor.
Brown people, I tell you. They're something else.

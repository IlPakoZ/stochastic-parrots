Nujabes and J Dilla are the legendary goats of their fields. You'll wanna look at homosexuality in gangster rap. There's a damn fine Boondocks episode that touches on the topic. The history of hip-hop has the soul and rb aspect beneath it's umbrella and it's a fascinating history.
The drugs and sex they've normalized in it's themes has been a 100 year (at least) trend, since jazz cigarettes and slam poetry.

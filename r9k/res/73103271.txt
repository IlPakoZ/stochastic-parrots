Why are you asking /r9k/, go to /g/

this is my home
First, check the available disks and their partitions using the lsblk command in the terminal. This will show you a list of all the disks and partitions on your system.
Decide which disk you want to use for your new partition. Make sure it has enough free space to accommodate your /home files.
Next, use the fdisk or parted command to create a new partition on the chosen disk. For example, if you want to create a new partition on /dev/sda, you can use the following command:
sudo parted /dev/sda mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
This will create a new primary partition on the disk with the file system type "ext4" that spans the entire disk.
Once the partition is created, you need to format it with a file system. For example, to format the partition with the ext4 file system, you can use the following command:
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdaX
Replace "X" with the partition number you just created (e.g. /dev/sda1).
Next, create a mount point for the new partition. For example, you can create a directory called /mnt/new_home:
sudo mkdir /mnt/new_home
Now, you can mount the new partition to the mount point you just created. For example, to mount the new partition /dev/sdaX to /mnt/new_home, you can use the following command:
sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/new_home
Finally, you need to copy the contents of your existing /home directory to the new partition. You can do this with the rsync command:
sudo rsync -av /home/ /mnt/new_home/
This will copy all the files and directories from your existing /home directory to the new partition.
Once the copying is complete, you can unmount the new partition and mount it to the /home directory. For example:
sudo umount /mnt/new_home
sudo mount /dev/sdaX /home
To ensure that the new partition is mounted automatically at boot, add an entry to the /etc/fstab file. For example:
/dev/sdaX /home ext4 defaults 0 2
This will mount the new partition to /home with the ext4 file system and default options at boot.

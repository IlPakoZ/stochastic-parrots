My confession is that I was an abusive bitch to my ex bf. I left him to be with another guy (who im still with btw), but before I did I convinced him to start HRT to "get a more androgynous look" because I thought it would be "hot" and he actually ended up doing it. Idk if he still kept taking HRT after I left, but I know he also started taking SSRI's after our break up so his dick is going to be broken beyond repair. I guess my goal was to make it so I was the best sex/relationship he was ever gonna have so he would always be stuck thinking of me and the time before he didn't suffer from sexual dysfunction. Idk I don't really regret it because 4 years later he will still try to contact me or my friends so it def worked

Why did you want to ruin a perfectly good man?
<comment>
dunno I dont have a diagnosis but probably bpd or something. he was mine for a while so I still want claims on him and want to be on his mind even tho i was the one who broke up with him.
<comment>
Are you ever going to leave your new boyfriend to be with someone else?

dark triad female ruins guy's life for an ego trip 
Many such cases
<comment>
I still want claims on him and want to be on his mind
What does this do for you?
<comment>
because 4 years later he will still try to contact me or my friends so it def worked
The fact that you seem determined to give him an eternal silent treatment is by far the worst thing here. Talk to him, you evil fucking bitch.
<comment>
I'm aware enough to know it was for my ego im not gonna make excuses or lie ab why
No plans on it, he is the love of my life we been together for 4 years, and he's ok with me staying home and not working.
<comment>
What would talking to him accomplish? I already hurt him as badly as I wanted to no need to make it worse.
<comment>
People wonder what dark triad guys look like in female form, this is it. Abuse of their sexual appeal to ruin guys' life for an ego trip.
<comment>
You're an idiot. Do you know how unbelievably painful it is to be ignored? How the fuck would you know whether or not it would 'accomplish' anything, you don't even know what he wants. Ignoring him *is* making it worse, dumbfuck. Talking to him is what would make it better.
<comment>
I dont really care about making it better tho. As long as he is still thinking about me that's fine, I have no desires for him to be in my life. Just wanna live rent free in his mind forever.
<comment>
This thread would be really sad if it wasn't just bait.
<comment>
The fact that you think its bait tells me that I accomplished everything I needed to and def ruined all future relationships for him thx
<comment>
This thread would be really sad if it wasn't just bait.
Girls do shit like this all the time, it's one of the ultimate female fantasies to have a loser guy give her undying loyalty through just sex appeal, and never having to actually have sex with him. Look at Harry Potter, Twilight etc. so many stories play out this scenario time and time again because women love self inserting as the woman who has a ton of power over men through sex appeal.
<comment>
You scarily sound like me and my story, almost as if you knew me irl and wanted to larp as me. Either way cool stuff sis I'm glad Im not the only obsessive psychopath here
<comment>
Do u have any diagnosed mental illness and if so what is it? I def feel like there needs to be something wrong w me but i'm not depressed or anxious or anything so idc to try to fix any possible problem lmao.
<comment>
There's a BPDemon I still think about years later because she was so aggressive. BPDemons are neat
<comment>
you have a disease called "sanity" where you rationally seek to maximize your personal pleasure, minimize your discomfort, and cause suffering to your enemies/playthings. the jews will seek to cure you of this with their pills and morality so you better not tell anyone
<comment>
I do think meds are over prescribed but i'm not anti semitic.
I hope my ex I ruined thinks ab me the rest of his life, I hope I damaged him beyond repair, not just something he can heal from in a few years.
<comment>
i just showed him this thread and he's fine
<comment>

Well it's possibly a good thing I instinctually evaded the BPDemon. Her face and attitude about everything was scary, I don't know how people don't see these things. But now I'm still a virgin and mentally broken anyways
<comment>
most sane bpdemon
<comment>
I don't have BPD tho at least not to my knowledge
<comment>
bitch u evil, find God please
<comment>
i hope i ruin someone too, sounds amazing :)
<comment>
whats ur @?
<comment>
U should it feels good
Why?
<comment>
u seem cool
<comment>
I'm convinced the average chick is more abusive than the average dude. It just isn't usually physical so it's not identified as abuse.
<comment>
R u a boy or a girl (biological gender please)
Mental abuse is more fun anyway. It is better to totally mind break someone for life than to just punch them.
<comment>
i am a girl (biological)
<comment>
I will strike you down where you stand, fiend.
<comment>
If you managed to convince them to take HRT, they weren't a man to start. Fucking retard got what she deserved. However, you're just as much of a fuck tard if not more so for dating someone like that. At the end of the day, just two mongoloids fighting over who can be more pathetic.
<comment>
He didnt want to be a girl, he just wanted to be androgynous. He was also kinda ugly and awkward and would just do whatever he could to please me. Low T for sure, but never a tranny. 
Do u like to do stuff like this to men as well?
<comment>
dude calm down. no need to get fired up over bait. ;)
<comment>
i would honestly choke the life out of you if i could
<comment>
Boohoo one low t male can't ever get a girlfriend as good as me. It impacts u for sure.
I love that u guys think this is bait that just reassures me that it worked
<comment>
Same thing. Weak and pathetic. Should have been just become a woman, would have been better for it.
<comment>
nice trips. and no, i dont. but i do want to learn more about mindbreaking fuckboys in case i need to.
<comment>
Even if this isn't bait, I'm not even angry. I've come to expect this kind of behavior from women (And a big part of why I've chosen to not be involved with them). I do feel bad for your ex though, he didn't deserve what you put him through.
<comment>
Reality is the fiction we choose to invest ourselves in, if you want it to be larp bait, it is, if you don't; then it isn't. Functionally identical believing that to believing in reality, with the added benefit that you decide.
<comment>
This turned me the fuck on. 
Tfw no abusive gf to ruin me and dump me leaving me destroyed for any future gf's
<comment>
If you want it to be a LARP bait, you can
I could frankly care less.
<comment>
My bpd gf tried this with me actually. So I dumped her and got a new gf.
I'm not ruining my body for anyone, you're evil and I'd skin you alive.
<comment>
why would you want to have a girlfriend?
<comment>
I don't know why people think this is bait. This is exactly the sort of cowardly, insidious, irrational, and completely self-centered sort of abuse women commit.
<comment>
You end up single and with a non functioning penis, how is this arousing? 
A mean yea your right he didn't deserve it but that doesn't make me regret it. I will be his best lover for the rest of his life now. 
Ur ex was either not good at being manipulative or u just arent a push over. Evil is a bit of a strong word tho.
<comment>
No, evil isn't a strong enough word. Anyone that lets others mistreat them are weak shit. You may think you could do this to any man you want but you'd be wrong.
<comment>
The fact that you don't regret it is proof that you're evil. I also wouldn't be surprised if you had BPD.
<comment>
Convincing someone to take hormones and antidepressants purely for a sadistic sense of pleasure at their destruction is all but objectively evil. You're in denial, femanon.
<comment>
It's just one person tho he will live, if he can't have sex or feel love as strongly oh well it's not like I fucking killed him.
<comment>
Ah, this is the root cause of your evil I think. You're incapable of grasping the immense potential value that even "just one" human life has.
<comment>
Just one person, not like I killed him
Neat! So I can theoretically lock you in a shipping container bound and gagged, feed you only once a day, and repeatedly rape you over and over again while injecting shit into your body to irreparably change it and NOT be considered evil? That's cool!
<comment>
You're an edgy retarded bitch with no self awareness and your ex is a simp faggot with no self respect. You seem perfect for each other.
<comment>
I didn't rape him, I didn't take away any of his bodily autonomy unlike what you said in your hypothetical. He is a big boy, he still CHOSE to do it even if he was manipulated. Not my fault he was a weak willed bitch. At least i'll be living rent free in his little mind. 
Why do you think I left him in the first place?
<comment>
Moving the goalposts
Women are some of the most predictable creatures in existence haha!
hurr durr it's not evil because I SAY it's not evil
Every day I'm reminded why I avoid you disgusting little parasites.
<comment>
dont talk to her like that. im sure she understands what shes done.
<comment>
I appreciate the brutal honesty but you should consider growing up and changing as a person.
Also, how the fuck can you obtain hrt on the basis of "I want to look more androgynous."? Is It really that easy these days?
<comment>
From one fembot to another, I recommend finding a tall building and jumping off.
<comment>
Legally HRT requires a prescription, but there's an easily-accessible black market for it.
<comment>
She doesn't though. I mean, she understands it on a concrete level, but she clearly doesn't understand it on a moral level.
<comment>
How is this thread still up
Be canadian, it's much easier here
Ew women who hate other women r cringe. Would rather have another evil female friend then a moral fag.
<comment>
nah there are physically abusive women and mentally abusive men. women get a pass because of gynocentrism not because of it being mental.
<comment>
ugly and awkward and would just do whatever he could to please me
that's not indicative of low t tho anon, i got tested
<comment>
What are the actual symptoms of low T? I'm really soft and unmanly and submissive, but I also have a strong sex drive so I feel like my T probably isn't that low.
<comment>
morally speaking you should be tortured and have your head cut off.
<comment>
hm not sure. those do seem like low t things tho. also just kinda memein i'm a pushover but i can enforce more boundaries than op's ex

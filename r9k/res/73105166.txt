Would people make fun of me for getting chin enlargement surgery?
you look like how psychicpebbles draws himself
I wouldn't waste the money. You have hard beta male face. The Jew nose, the eye bags. You would just look unnatural with a Chad chin.
Yes, but why should you care? They already make fun of you, don't they?
I'm not gay, but u kinda cute
forsen looking mfer
Lol exact match.
Are you max verstappen's cousin?
Brother fixing that nose should be the first priority. If that dont help then start thinking about the chin.
hahaha thought the same
You realize you can make your jaw stronger with exercise right? You don't need plastic surgery. All you need are some neck, shoulder, and jaw exercises.
Are you a mall cop?
He should take the Verstappenpill and larp as him
you look like nostalgia bash
i would make fun of any man that gets plastic surgery. grow the fuck up dude
im sure if you really want you could do exercises for your chin or whatever but you don't need surgery.
more likely then not it will make the perportions of your face look weird
you honestly don't look that bad, if you want to do this for the girls then just work on your social skills instead
15 minutes of mewing every day for 3 weeks straight will fix your jaw
this
stop being such a fucking mouth breather.
stick your tongue on the back of your front teeth gumline. that needs to be its resting position.
if you have any pets, take allergy medication.
use tape on your mouth when you sleep so it forces you to breathe through your nose.
this is the chin profile of a mouth breather.
get your chin and nose fixed up and you'll be pretty handsome.
the eye bags are fine with a good chin (and leaving the nose as is) you'll have a french look.
btw isnt the issue jaw rather than chin?
Go for it, OP. Anyone makes fun of you for it, just give em the fuckin finger.

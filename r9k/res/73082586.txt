be me
female friend complains about cooking a lot for her husband
ask her what's so difficult
tells me that it's hard to properly cook things like pasta and pork chops
decide to try for myself
buy pasta and pork chops from grocery
heat up some water in a pot
put pasta in and leave it there for 8 minutes
it's ready and tastes fine
put oil in a pan and cook pork chops for 4 minutes each side after covering them with salt and pepper
they taste fine
all of it was easy
i don't get it. most of it was just putting things in a pan and pot then waiting for a few minutes. what's so difficult?
this nigga eating plain pasta
a-anon, did you just cook for the first time just to prove a point?
Women spew this kind of nonsense all the time. Hell, half of first-wave feminism was complaining about the "uncompensated labor" they did in the home.
When I stay home all day and cook for myself and clean up a little and do some laundry, that is called "being on vacation". Women actually complain that being permanently on what I consider vacation means they are exploited and enslaved. It's nonsense.
What's wrong with being satisfied with easy, fast food rather than spending an extra hour seasoning and preparing everything
Well the obvious answer to the OP that she isn't serving her family plain pasta, but is preparing sauces and such to go on it.
Actually cooking the pasta (unless homemade) is the easiest part of pasta dishes, to the point where you'd usually have it on the backburner while doing everything else.
if i served that shit to my husband i'd have a black eye and i would deserve it. nigga you have a palate ruined by a mcnugget childhood
Nobody who complains about cooking is making spaghetti sauce from scratch. GUARANTEED that bitch opens a jar of Prego and pours it over the pasta without even heating it up.

Isn't it a waste of time to be a total loser, yet still help other people who are having trouble when they aren't going to reciprocate your kindness.
For example, consider you are working on a shitty beater of a car. You spend all the time and money fixing it up, only for some guy to take off with it and you have nothing to show for it other than the fond memories of working on it. If you try to help anyone when you have nothing, they're just going to leave you instead of taking you with them

Being nice is pointless. All they're going to do is exploit your kindness and take advantage of you. Be selfish and be proud of who you are.

I'm short, autistic, unmasculine (and have zero willingness to perform gendie roles for females), bad at conversation, poor, too busy focusing on education and survival for the past few years to focus on the massive effort it would take to make my personality into the sort of attractive masculine shit females want anyway, and I don't care about my appearance other than just making sure I'm relatively healthy (lost a lot of weight over the past few years) so I'm never going to work out and build muscle to make females wet. It all comes together to make me some wretched male feminist incel that women would rather die than be with

CouId have stopped right there.

Being short is already playing on hardmode, but everything else just makes it even worse

I think I matured later than most guys do. I had my best chances in high school when I was fit and had nice hair and girls didn't seem to care as much if you were short (I'm 5'6"). 
Looking back there were definitely a couple girls in high school who were interested in me but I never acted on it. I never even thought about having a gf until I was 17. I was also really shy around women I was interested in.
In college I didn't do any of the normal college social things. I went to school and worked part time. I mostly hung out with my small friend circle on the weekends. I pursued a few women but was never successful. 
I got extremely frustrated with trying to date around age 24 and I just stopped for a couple years. I started up again around age 27, but I had basically the same experience.
I'm almost 34 and it seems my prospects are a little better now. I lost a bunch of weight a couple years ago and I overall feel better about myself. Up until about 2 months ago I was a khhv but now I'm just a virgin.

Do you want my full life story like the guy in the video? 
Long story short is just that I never really truly tried. I've never really had friends. 
I don't have friends, don't have a job, don't have hobbies and I spend 90% of my time shut in my room browsing the net.

Because I am obese, agoraphobic, self-hating, uninteresting, and aspergic. It was over before it even began.

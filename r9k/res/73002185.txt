Jealousy, I for one of people would throw away my decency for money if all I had to do was sit in front of a camera with my swimsuit.
95% of streamers are oxygen wasting no talent retard leeches who deserve to go to guantanamo bay for wasting people's time with their stupid bullshit. If people had friends and actual social lives, these idiots would be homeless. Female streamers are especially bad because of the simp epidemic
I'm not jealous of a bunch of faggots who go out in public and hold cameras to their faces. It looks so pathetic and demoralizing to society, you would rather interact on your fucking phone than talk to actual people. I fucking hate streamers so much they should all just die like Reckful.
because virgin gamer guys feel like they need to stand up for "ALL MEN" against the oppressive hot streamers that are sucking all their money away
its ok shes hot
Show me exactly one man that is doing this.
Streaming is a charisma blackpill

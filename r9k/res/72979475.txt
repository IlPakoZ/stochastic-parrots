Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).
When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.

<comment>
I miss 20 hour threads
<comment>
I'll fucking show those image haters
<comment>
The last one didn't hit 300 posts, just because of one lad having a full-on autistic meltdown at nobody in particular. It sad.
<comment>
He never has meltdowns anymore. I want the old SSM back
<comment>

<comment>
Hood up, running up to women on nightwalks and scaring them.

He's upset that his dad touched him up, now he's fantasising about his mum getting fucked by a black bloke as some power fantasy revenge
<comment>
Image posting isn't a crime de lads
<comment>
You're going to die having never done any of the things you post about
<comment>
If the gf is preggers, will you stick wiff her or get a new gf?
<comment>
They have abandoned a thread because it hit image limit to come to a thread getting spammed with images so they can play lets pretend.
<comment>
shoving a camera in jobsworths' faces isn't a crime either
<comment>

<comment>
/deepfeel/: Nightwalk anon's dad is a police officer

Wonder how much money his fans will send him tomorrow
He was hinting he wanted some Hugo Boss fragrance earlier kek
<comment>
I wonder what it looks like in the flesh.
<comment>
Give this a little tickle princess x
<comment>
Nightwalk has gone fucking nuclear for some reason, the pressure has been building for months, years even. One day many, many years ago a police officer harassed him, and now in April 2023 he's spamming pictures of black blokes penises on 4chan because of it.
<comment>
Anime is gay my leed
<comment>
Looks quite stretched and worn. No doubt taken the BBC.
<comment>
He loves a bit of Blacked he does
<comment>

<comment>
Ask me how i know you're a virgin x
<comment>
No my dad's fucking dead.
I'm not posting any degenerate porn. They fucking got away with tackling me to the ground for no reason and walking away laughing.

Friendly reminder that it's entirely your fault that people ITT are even aware of Ruth :)
<comment>
Image tyrants have no power here.
<comment>
Maybe so but I only wanted the best for her deep down.
<comment>
Women's feet smell much better.

If security follow you around more than twice (outside private property), it's considered harassment and you can totally do them in.

If i throw in another upper and pull an all-nighter i might even get the whole folder done

Backlog for what lad?
<comment>
Check your mail nightmach
<comment>
He's building a loser signs folder
<comment>
Nothing yet de lid as I haven't been anywhere. Need to a bit of shoppington tomorrow though.
<comment>
Just had a rando flashback to just over a week ago when i was on the hi-speed train and some actually mentally retarded negroe kept stepping into my seat so as to pretend look out of my window (he actually just wanted my seat and used this behaviour as some sort of botched cover lol) 
The mong did this for like 5 minutes straight, on and off, which kept irritating me more and more, so i just looked at him directly and he was still standing there
Then at some point this absolute maniac touches me and was stammering something to the effect of "p-puhlease" or sommet and i asked him whether he reserved the seat or what. Fucker just gave me a puzzled look and said "please" again, so i bolted and got the fuck up/changed seats before the mongoloid would infect me with AIDS or whatever 
Wasn't really prepared for a situation as bizarre and unexpected as this, but then again these people really aren't compatible with civilization at all. Never relax around them (i did relax because i saw him too late), even on a priceyarse hi-speed train you're not really safe from them and their incredibly bizarre behaviours
<comment>
Going shoppingtons tomorrow morning too. At least kids are back at school now so it should be quieter in town
<comment>
sommet 
Stopped reading there. German schizo post.
<comment>
What backlog you ask laddie? Why the usual stuff of course
<comment>
Another hairy situation of course was when i got off the train and first thing once i got out of the station i'm greeted with is some rando PoC trying to sell me illicit substances. He was really adamant about it too, and i didn't have any mace on me either
Was like "sorry mate" and just kept going, luckily he did not pursue me either
Gotta love the cultural enrichment
<comment>
We all go shoppingtons in life x
<comment>
soundspacker has some weird dreams wtf
<comment>

<comment>
Just finished American Horror Story: NYC. Have to say, not bad, not bad at all. Pretty clever the whole Big Daddy being the personification of HIV/AIDS thing. Honestly, I didn't get it until the very last wepisode. I thought he was just some evil ghost or something. There a few things I still don't get like why Patrick was revealed to be helping Whitely, which makes no sense whatsoever but never mind. Overall, I'd rate it probably my 4th favourite AHS season. And if you're not interested in AHS well I don't care.
<comment>
Someone should make a British Horror Story series but then again our history isn't as interesting. We get cringe royal dramas and shit like Downton Abbey. Basically shows made for middle-class Tories.
What was the last TV show made for the working-class? (reality TV shows don't count). The Royal Family? Maybe Benidorm? The last really good one was probably Bottom.
<comment>
Maddening farts escaping me arse

Just had sex, was a bit grim.
<comment>
SSM just turned 49. It's a lovely x
<comment>
The gf w/her shortass lazy responses again earlier, vgh
Really not liking the overt discrepancy here, even though this might be due to her still being down w/the flu or whatever 
Gonna hafta go for another make or break-type scenario most likely on [redacted] when i'll be calling her back again
<comment>
Well, time for some YouTubes in beddingtons then sleeps for me. Damn it feels good to be off the wooze. Nighty night lids.

One thing I've noticed is that vitality returns quickly once you stop drinking. Both mentally and physically.

<comment>
You shag an ugly cunt matey?
<comment>
That's because the parents are mohammedan too. You converting won't get you an arranged marriage
<comment>
Yeah I did. I often ponder if wanking is better in these situations
<comment>
rare pic of her outside. she went to a flower farm and enjoyed her day out of the box room. proud of her.
<comment>
Good decent progressington on the backlog corr
Just need to throw up the other chart and send out anuddah mail
Been looking for that fucking note but i'll probably do it ad lib rather than keep looking for it
<comment>
the benefit of being up at this time means my american asmr girls are uploading their videos for me to sleep to.

Depends on whether the cunt is into it or not i fink
My girl had a vaginal orgasm the other week when i took her doggystyle, her squirt or whatever the fuck it was stank up the whole fucking room but in a good way lol 
Beats fapping when they're excited and in the mood like this (even as an uggo, which mine isn't though), otherwise you might as well use a fleshlight
<comment>
Looks underage anon

Are women even aware of the incredibly power their pussies have? Great men have built and destroyed whole empires to get some pussy

Not sure whether that last kangdom movie is worth watching
I remember the series fondly but apparently they made aethelstan gay now or sommet

She has connective tissue disease and a low immune system. That affects her development. She has to take several medications a day. You have an easier life than her.

That's going to be Gibi if she doesn't hurry up with Ben.
<comment>
She's 22 and isn't planning to have children. She hates children (they annoy her).
<comment>
She says if you have a problem with her armpit hair, then don't watch her videos. She is a true feminist.
<comment>
when one stops the other starts up.
never ending SPAM
<comment>
and she has been doing asmr for over 5 years. She actually looks a lot better nowadays. Definitely got better with her hair and makeup.
<comment>
Knowing I'll never have a relationship makes me want to disrespect females.

Ooooooohhh, Sasha de Sade, good taste lad! Makes you proud to be British she does!
<comment>
In the bed sheets in the morning
And the busy river side, 
In the way she bares her joy, 
How she lets slip out a sigh, 
In the brief moments of stillness 
I feel immobilised, 
Confined within her gaze, 
Proud to be seen by just her eyes, 
Impatient for the words she speaks
And whatever comes next, 
Though she says it all with a hand on me, 
Placed on the backside of my neck

mum's problem, not mine
<comment>
I wish. It's literally just incompetence in running the country. The "elites" that govern us are an insult to the term. They are feckless, retarded mongs with no virtues to speak of. This is the end result of the democratic process - the elected officials really do represent the vast bulk of the people in this country and that's a fucking terrible thing.

You can't be stopped using an upload slot.
<comment>
Where do you live that you cant afford bills and rent?
<comment>
because you can eventually. you have to work your way up and then you'll be much better off than being NEET

watching that show makes me glad I'm not a wagie.
<comment>
What show are you on about
<comment>
You shouldn't need to work your way up. If I'm cleaning shit all day, I deserve a fair wage.

I'm in Kent and it would be financial suicide to work a minimum wage job and live on my own.

it'll be worse when they are automated. more unemployed people and reduced benefits, the government will blame the workers saying it's their fault. government will fight tooth and nail before they finally have to introduce UBI. it will happen though no matter what they do when mass complete automation becomes a reality and entire warehouses can be ran with less than 5 people in them. unfortunately i'll probably be dead by the time that happens and UBI comes along, won't be in my lifetime.

When I grow up I want to be an SSM
<comment>
I remember that gregg guy said on one of the episodes "you wouldn't want to do this for 12 hours a day" to a wagie with his smug grin. poor slave said "whatever puts food on the table"with his soulless smile. I bet he wanted to kill himself right there knowing some slaphead millionaire just mocked him for millions to watch.
<comment>
UBI will have to happen. The uneducated will cause havoc without any suitable work.
<comment>
Luckily I only do it for 8 hours a day hehehe.. heh.. he..
<comment>
Just looked up Gregg Wallace, turns out that all his businesses and restaurants folded after a few years due to huge debts. But this guy goes around pretending to be some successful entrepreneur, when in reality he just parlayed his middling (and ultimately failing) businesses into a TV career which is idiot-proof. 
Can't stand people who go around patronising wagies and pretending that work and toil is somehow noble in and of itself. But this guy just seems like salt on the wound since his own schtick of 'if I can do it so can you' is based on lies.
What a fucking cunt.
<comment>
the government will fight tooth and nail before they finally have to introduce UBI.
HAHAHAHAHAHA no, the government is looking for any excuse it can to expand welfare, make more people dependent on the state and formally introduce UBI and CBDC (beyond the already informal UBI of bennies - really what's the difference?).
After decades of totalitarian socialism we're gonna go full hard commie mode at some point and the powers that be are drooling at the possibilities.
Oh and immigration will not stop even then.
<comment>
You work in a factory or airport lad?
<comment>
Fuck me this Wallace guy gets worse the more you read about him. He's been divorced three times, fucking hell. What a loser. Why is this guy a 'thing'? Like what's his appeal?
<comment>
Working class think they can be him one day.
<comment>
Can't stand him. I hope he gets some allegations made against him soon from young women (he likes them young) and we finally see him vanish from the public eye.
<comment>
No I don't but an airport would be the better option.

<comment>
how many synthol injections you want mate?
yes.
<comment>
Is it worth trying online dating if i'm not chad and unemployed? Sound spacker and SSM both managed it somehow so surely I can too? What's the secret?
<comment>
Full time minimum wage is about 1300 rake home a month, how can you not aford to live on that?

A lot of luck. Most women expect a man to be the breadwinner. If you can't step up, they know there's plenty more men willing to.
<comment>
What's the secret?
being on there almost 24/7 and not being picky. accept you aren't going to get someone you consider attractive. ssm spoke in the past about how he was on multiple sites messaging everyone. spundspacker would also often greentext consistently about women not replying back or ugly women ghosting him after a few messages. think of it like grinding for a rare drop in a video game, just takes a lot of time of doing the same thing for hours on end.
<comment>
Mark this post. There will be some damning allegations against Gregg Wallace come to light within the next five years.

I was right about Schofield too.

In the bed sheets in the morning
And the busy river side, 
In the way she bares her joy, 
How she lets slip out a sigh, 
In the brief moments of stillness 
I feel immobilised, 
Confined within her gaze, 
Proud to be seen by just her eyes, 
Impatient for the words she speaks
And whatever comes next, 
Though she says it all with a hand on me, 
Placed on the backside of my neck 
I'm musing as I lay here
In her arms and in her aw, 
She guesses at my love for her,
She doesn't know it's more.

Wasnt on last night but on adverage night threads are better if slower
<comment>
they'll all have the memo by now to not engage and only block them from going any further.
<comment>
A mate said when that Gregg guy visited a factory he was at, staff were told he doesn't like to be spoken to off camera. Right stuck up twat.
<comment>
Cant think of a gregg i like
<comment>
No one posts images in the day threads
Odd
<comment>
Agree that slower is mostly better. That's what /brit/ tards can't get their heads around.

Here you go mate something a bit different

If a foid ignores you when you ask her something politely, get out your phone, make up something like "so this girl called me a racist name, yeah look at her staying quiet now she's on camera...how do you feel about me exposing you on social media?"
<comment>
Time for me shittingtonberg its going to be a fat one I can tell

Bunch of faggots.
<comment>
Is it true? flid doesn't even use a blade, just a pin to scratch?
<comment>
Just shows he has nothing of worth to add, just a spamfag.
<comment>
WHO keeps spamming to the image limit?!
<comment>
He has the approval of these faggots.
Silence is encouraging it.
<comment>
Probably you isn't it. Barely anyone ever posts images during the day so no one's arsed.
<comment>
Went for that 2k run after all. Proud of meself lads.

Well done lad. More than I could manage.
<comment>
thread seems a lot more pro tranny than when i stopped posting here
comfy
<comment>
also what happened to the cool thread op images
<comment>
There where "boring" apparently
Now Its either alcoholic fat man or some tranny , town posting was nice for OP images but that too got shot down because its not some bloke in a dress or some fat cunt endlessly repeating the same thing over and over because alcohol has destroyed his brain 
Place is in a right state, before all these wfh wankers appeared it was pretty womfy during the day
<comment>
I'm such a piece of shit.
I don't want anyone to hurt themselves. What a cunt.

*smoke on the water plays softly in the background*
Im a fuckin top shagger la
shagged all your maws hooooles
you have ta put the work in if you wanna be a top shagger like your old da
im a shagger and youre a virgin, ahhhhhh virgin!
<comment>
I am the best shagger ITT and it's not even close. I've tried to estimate how many birds I've shagged and beyond the first hundred it's hard to keep track really. I've cum in so many birds it's unreal. Fucked two and even three at a time before. Got road head plenty of times. Fucked the arses of more than half the brids I've shagged too - they just can't say no to me. Had them dress up in sexy outfits, cover themselves in oil, text their boyfriends while fucking me etc. etc.
I've done it all. I've shagged them all. I'm the best shagger ITT bar none.
<comment>
anons dad could out-shag you
<comment>
trannies make me gag, and i'm gay
<comment>
He really couldn't; as I said, I'm the best shagger ITT bar none. Like it's honestly not even close. I have shagged so many birds in so many ways that I've basically lost my passion for it. Don't get me wrong, I still shag on the regular with a ton of birds, but it's basically mechanical at this point. I text one, they respond, we meet up, she sucks my cock, I cum in her face, then we part. I'm enjoying rising above my base needs now because pre-shagging I was an unfocussed mess, but now I have more focus, time, energy etc. to do what I want with my days without worrying about where my next shag is coming from.
<comment>
Sure i've seen that copypasta eslewhere
<comment>
It's not a copypasta, I just typed my Lived Experience and now it makes virgins mad.
<comment>
Actually really good, did you write this?
<comment>
Looks life we need a shag off to finish this once and for all
<comment>
I would shag his dad into the ground, mate. I keep telling you lads that nobody shags like I do and I mean it. I've never met anyone who shags more or harder that wasn't paid to do so.
<comment>
actually lad i reckon i'm the top shagger here
actually shagged someone from this thread even i'm just that potent and irresistible
<comment>
I'm playing CS while I have the flu and some gay lad could tell me in my voice I'm sick and started mothering me.

she walked 17 miles to skid row where she died in a trailer 2021
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Skye_(actress)
<comment>
Her husband recalled times she threatened him with a knife, or when she flew to Paris "to make a sex tape with a stranger". Skye would claim to be watched by hidden cameras, a target for assassination because of an affiliation with the Kennedy family, and a victim of rape by Ron Jeremy.
Kek seemed like a fun lass
<comment>
During the evening of June 8, 2021, Skye told friends and coworkers that "the FBI and the Mafia were after her [and] she was going to go become a Hells Angel biker". Everyone she called refused her a place to stay, so Skye walked from the San Fernando Valley to Los Angeles' Skid Row.
What a life

tfw no tomboy well-dressed caring gf
Formal wear looks so beautiful and classy and dignifying on women, i wish it was normalized
Dress clothes don't suit me when I boymode, baggy seems to be the only way I can pull it off convincingly.

Love that never told can be
For the gentle wind does move
Silently invisibly"
Not sure OP is looking for boymoders though. Do you have short hair? Do you work out a lot?
I do have short hair, and work out some. If tomboy is the exclusive word though then yeah probably not.
Yeah it is a bit confusing because it can include boymoders from the word itself, but I just thought he wasn't based on the images he posted. How masculine are you like, or want to be?
Enough to pass completely which I think I've managed, after a lot of time and effort. I get mistaken as a guy by other women now.
i didn't reply to my own post sir.

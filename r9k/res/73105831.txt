I hate work.
I hate studying.
I hate other people.
All I want is to give up on everything and live the NEET life. However, my parents aren't rich, I don't have money saved up, and the government has no gibs.
I have computer skills and I'm really good at math I guess, could I use that to make money somehow?
Or should I just commit sudoku?
I've felt that way my whole life and I dropped out of school to be a NEET at 16. I'm 27 now, still never tried to get gibs, still never tried to get a job, still never tried to get a driver's license, I have zero skills, and I lack basic knowledge like how to file taxes. When I become homeless I'm going to kill myself. I'll be entirely alone with no way to stay alive

Yes, and go to church so that you don't forget to take care of your soul

Remember, plenty of people on this website are trained to spot how you individually speak and they will follow you across each board depending on how you type and speak. These people will attack those who are proponents advocators and encouragers of technologies and ideas like those of the support for AI.
If you were to consider yourself a free thinker, or to consider yourself that of a free mind, remember to exhibit restraint from saying some of the things in your mind on here, or anywhere else on the surface web, that may give other people the chance to silence you.

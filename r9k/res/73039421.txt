It's so easy to tell who got the clot shot and who didn't just by how they act. There's something real bad in that shit. Like it's not even subtle how bad the effects are, shit. Dudes take the clot shot and they suddenly start acting strange within a couple months, out of the blue. Then when you interact with peeps who who didn't take the clot shots, you can tell they're their usual intelligent self. I'm thinking it's causing some brain damage due to the clot effects. Gotta eat up on those beets and take some L-Citrulline powder to try to repair those blood vessels or some shit @clot shotties

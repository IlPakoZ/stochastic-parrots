Rank your siblings. From Most liked to Least liked/ Best to Worst 
1: younger brother
I've always had a soft spot for him since I held him while he was a baby and I'm 10 years older than him.
Out of all my siblings I have nothing and never had anything in my heart against and wish him nothing but the best forever.
2: oldest sister
She's been my favorite sibling before my brother was born and we are the closest in bond because she's
just a year older than me. So we know "our generation" pretty well. But we have gotten into a lot of
arguments and disagreements since she has a dominant and argumentative personality while I'm chill and carefree.
3: younger sister
We've hated each other since the day she was born and I still don't know why I hated her since I was like 2 years old.
But over the years we've reconciled and now I have more in common with her than my older sister.
4: youngest sister
She copies my personality and style. We used to be cool growing up but drifted apart. It's painful to say it but,
she's the female version of me or the closest to it. Except she's not ugly. Still I have no deep hatred towards her.

All of my siblings dislike me, I'm the only male in the family and I constantly get shit on by my sisters, aunts, ect. The only other males in my family is my dad who's almost never around and my uncle who likes his "successful" nephew more than his sperg nephew.

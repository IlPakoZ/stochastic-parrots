 enter relationships with a "sub" man
that is according to him and his presentation
 aside from pussy eating he is a complete dead log in bed
 has no personality, aside from being a doormat; nor interests whatsoever
 gets offended when I order him to to not indulge in whatever pleasures that day, despite positioning himself as submissive (does it anyway, but grows bitter)
The idea of submissive man is cute, but I guess its just a redflag for lazyass pussy after all.
u unhinge ur turdwhore jaw and i slide a thick pungent log into your eager gullet

Congratulations, you just experienced what it's like to date a woman, lmfao.
sex 1997 with natalie imbruglia.
What exactly would you want from a submissive partner? I'd do pretty much anything to please the woman I loved. I will not take it in the ass though
You have a terribly nasty habit of generalizing anything you dislike. That's an indicator of emotional retardation. It's like a little boy picking on girls for cooties or never turning away all vegetables before they eat them because they didn't like broccoli once. Like holy shit how old are you? Are you really that sensitive and flat out dumb after all this time?
yet you provided a retard like that with easy access to sex
I would treat you like the whore you know you are
I'm not "submissive" but I have nothing to offer a woman outside love. I'm not attractive, I'm not tall, I'm not interesting and I'm not a billionaire. 90% of "submissive" men are like that too except some internalized negativity to the extent they want to be hurt by a "lover" too
holy fuck, winrar!
I kek'd
I'd like to mold him into me perfect husband, desu.
He isnt that interestex in sex, its mostly the other way around.
What do you even define as love
i think maybe if someone wants to live their fetish outside of sex time it's a huge redflag.

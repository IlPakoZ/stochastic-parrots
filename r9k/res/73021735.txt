seems like someone got called a faggot
<comment>
That guy is not normal, not funny, and you can tell he's just as autistic/socially maladjusted as the people he's mocking.

This is just blatantly making fun of autistic people. Where the fuck does 4chan fit into this? Oh, the insinuation that we are all nazis? Yea, alright.

I don't get it. He didn't say sneed once
<comment>
I'm guessing the '"meme" that nobody knows' bit was supposed to be a reference to something like sneed, but he doesn't actually know any 4chan memes.

He could've said something about the car being made in Guatemala
<comment>
his reddit videos are way funnier, he obviously doesn't go on 4chan so this one sucked
<comment>
Yeah shit's fucked. I'd love a nice m81 jacket, but those have just gotten exponentially more pricey. Even worse is the surp gun market

It's difficult to put into words how little I care what normalfags think, unless their perspective weighs into something material like work or whatever

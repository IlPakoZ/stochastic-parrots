seems like someone got called a faggot
That guy is not normal, not funny, and you can tell he's just as autistic/socially maladjusted as the people he's mocking.
redditor makes fun of reddit humor, blames 4chan
how is that a 4chan user? the only faggots that I know use memes in real life are redditors. just look up redditor meetups for confirmation of this
these faggot are responsible for driving up the prices for military surplus 
how am i supposed to get cheap gear if the companies who sell surplus now market everything towards hipster retards?

It's a meem, ya dip.
53 seconds
No chance
This is just blatantly making fun of autistic people. Where the fuck does 4chan fit into this? Oh, the insinuation that we are all nazis? Yea, alright.
Also, Sieg Heil!
The left openly wants whites dead.
I don't get it. He didn't say sneed once
I'm guessing the '"meme" that nobody knows' bit was supposed to be a reference to something like sneed, but he doesn't actually know any 4chan memes.
He could've said something about the car being made in Guatemala
his reddit videos are way funnier, he obviously doesn't go on 4chan so this one sucked
Yeah shit's fucked. I'd love a nice m81 jacket, but those have just gotten exponentially more pricey. Even worse is the surp gun market

It's difficult to put into words how little I care what normalfags think, unless their perspective weighs into something material like work or whatever
This is how normies view y-
Nah, don't care.

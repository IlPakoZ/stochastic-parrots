I want a trophy wife but I absolutely refuse to put in the work necessary to obtain that trophy.

lmao why? you say you have to put in work to obtain one, which implies you're a low status male. getting a hot woman to show around will just make you a cuck because guys will see her w/ you and automatically know you're a beta that won't do shit.

Trophies are outdated. It's all about virtual tokens now. so why not get a waifu instead.

Glad someone understands this and said it. It doesn't really matter if a beta is seen with a hot woman in public. It's obvious to anyone that you don't even sleep in the same bedroom.

What the fuck, is this how sleeper agents are made? Is it normal to remember memories you haven't touched in so long? Are they like honey?
do you mean amber anon 
this is cute regardless of what you mean
Memories are like sled trails down the slope of a hill. The more you activate the pathway and designate significance to it, the deeper and more defined the trail becomes. If you disregard the source of the memory or rarely activate the pathway, the trail will eventually be buried in snow. Rarely are memories 100% lost. Your brain just can't find the precise trail.
Well, I can understand the significance of remembering that Super Mario Galaxy played "Spaceman" from The Killers in it because I would later use the song in my forum signature back when you could do HTML shenanigans and have a single square youtube "Play button".
Or that the Dead or Alive Volleyball game had "Hey Soul Sister" because I hated the song.
No idea for everything else, tho.
Pretty much this. Only the access to said memories is ever modulated, but you're almost near constantly forming permanent memories even if the memories are fragmented or low quality. All you need is said stimulus trigger to activate the paths to remember them. You'll soon "forget" them if they aren't relevant to your stream of consciousness. Often you will remember things that you thought were completely gone from your childhood. I've had dreams that contain the content of fucking patterns on old blankets from when I was a baby and now I can recall it still for no reason.
Pretty neat.
I thought that brains worked like computers where shit is just overwritten.

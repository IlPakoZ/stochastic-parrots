THERE IS NO WAY TO COPE WITH THIS
I JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT UNTIL I DIE

I'm happy for you anon, because you recognize the truth. You might feel bad about it now, but you saying this is very good. You can get out of the spiral of madness and death, I believe in you.

Not possible. It's been with me since day 1.
Eventually I'll rope or troon out then rope. 
I am incompatible with the modern world.

Do you know why Eastern countries do better at Math than even the most developed Western countries? A study made students take 2 quizzes, one about their attitude about math which was optional, another a proper math quiz. They found that the correspondence between "kids that filled the optional quiz" and "kids that did the best in the math quiz" was one to one. Meaning that if the country averaged 10th in the optational quiz, they magically also averaged 10th in the math quiz. 
The reason why this happens is because in Western countries, we focus too much on birth and natural talent. When a Western kid sees a math problem they can't solve, they think "I can't do this because it's beyond my abilities, if only I was born smarter I could solve it", meanwhile Eastern kids think "I can't solve this right now. However, if I apply myself and have patience, in the future I might solve it".
In the end everything is about attitude anon. It might not seem this way because our attitude is shaped by those around us when we grow, but change is always possible. You can't change biology, but you change your attitude towards it. You just have to believe in yourself, know that this could all be temporary - and that things can be better in the future.

Well then in the future there needs to be a cure for my mental illness or a complete sex change that makes people identical to their preferred sex. Eitherway I will be too old to enjoy any of the options.

That's the problem I want to get at anon. You want something outside you to solve your problems. It's never going to happen that way. You don't really want to change the outside but the inside. It's easy to imagine what looking like a woman might be like, but what does it feel like to be a woman? I don't know. You don't know. And we will never know. If you want to be cured, you have to change from the inside.

Well then how do I change the inside. Everything that gets repeated on here is a cope that only works on people who don't have genuine dysphoria. There's an Army ranger that trooned out. The dysphoria never goes away
just lift bro

Aren't demons fallen angels? Wait, were demons a metaphor for trans people all along???

Like I said, that's up to you to find out. I don't know what being like you is like at all, nobody does but you. Just don't do anything stupid until you figure it out.
Pro tip: doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.

No they weren't.
Stop being retarded.
If anything, demons and evil spirits was attempt to explain mental illnesses and sadism.

At least if you rope without trooning your parents will still love and remember you after death.

Think about it, anon. They went from one group to another. The devil himself is said to have the appealing characteristics of both male and female.

Most immoral post I've ever read
<comment>
True enough 
But cope exists, most of the time I just dont even think about it anymore 
And also important is that youre not alone.
Most places online are for the trooning out will solve everything cult, but theres a bunch of other people in our situation too
Not sane enough to be happy in our bodies but not insane enough to destroy it with meds and surgeries
<comment>
why do you want to be one?
<comment>
just larp as a woman in anonymous imageboard
<comment>
You're a man and will always be a man, also kill yourself.
<comment>
just because you were poorly socialized, cant relate to normalfags and notice women get a bully-free pass for being weird doesnt mean youre a woman. 
this is the unfortunate truth trannies need to know.

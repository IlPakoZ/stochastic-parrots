Also before my job went perma-remote in 2020 I used to get the starbucks frappuccino bottles from the vending machine at my office sometimes.

I had a fucking iced frappuicino today for the first time in several months.
Now I KNOW the demons are watching and posting.
<comment>
I did when I was a teenager. Who give a fuck desu

i don't drink starcucks
i only drink black coffee with grounds that i made myself
but i only drink coffee like once or twice a month if even that. i hate the taste of coffee and covering it with sugar doesn't help.\
<comment>
Given the option, hell yeah.
Why don't I give you my own recipe?
1 Vanilla Bean Frappe, Venti
1 pump of Whip Cream at the bottom, plenty on top
2 servings of Dragonfruit on the bottom, 1 for the whipped topping
4 pumps of Raspberry Syrup.
On a very bad day, I drank this in a ghetto neighborhood asking for suicide. They went "damn, that looks bussin".
Make of that what you will.

It's a fucking drink, how is it "masculine" or "feminine"?
<comment>

Yikes! Incel trait

I've always tended towards skinny and prefer high calories foods and drinks wherever possible.
Be less autistic, it's obvious what that means.

iced latte. need the caffeine strength in the morning to wake me up
<comment>
only cheap vodka and instant coffee with no sugar
I'm too broke for that 
t. people can't enjoy anything anymore because some is gonna call some bullshit on them
<comment>
It's a drink. do people really care?
<comment>
It's actually really important because drinking a frappucino as a man is a symbol of weakness and femininity. It's furthering the downfall of America and decaying masculinity.
<comment>
I just drink black hazelnut coffee.
<comment>
imagine being such a schizo that you actually care about what people drink.
<comment>
I don't even know what that is, anon.
<comment>
Are there any of these that just taste like chocolate milk?
<comment>
Blacks love those fruity drinks. A black guy at the restaurant I worked at made a strawberry shortcake once, all these grilled out thugs who worked in the kitchen were losing their minds over it.
<comment>
I bought one on accident once and I felt so gay
<comment>
Yes. They're tasty
<comment>
Fellas, is it gay to drink caffeinated beverages?

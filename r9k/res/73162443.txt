My tinder account was banned for no reason ! Is there a way i can get around it so I can continue cooming in qt3.14 girls?
The only way I can currently get around it is by purchasing an entirely new phone which I will not do.
sign up on your phone with a google phone number, register your email, and then just login in through your browser on the PC through your email. that's what i did.

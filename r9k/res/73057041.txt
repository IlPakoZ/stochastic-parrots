then join them and ruin their fun

Mh how old are you? I used to skate and we always welcomed people if they got questions or wanted to try as long as you are not a creep
call the police tell them someone is dealing weed.
Funny vid mate 
19
And gain animosity against a bunch of hooligans
Become a troon, get beaten by them and call the police over them.
Kind of interesting. I'd be inclined to watch and it'd make me happy. Idk hiking one day some kids were on dirt bikes and thought maybe I'd call the cops, I'm like nah I just like to watch. They might be pretty good. You could even make friends if you're not that far out of age range if they want to film their tricks or something, you don't have to skate.
Nigger you're still young. go outside and skate with them

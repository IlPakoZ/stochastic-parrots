There's a girl who I assume is eastern european that always sits by herself at work. She is probably in her mid 20s. I'm in my late 20's. She rarely has some filipina girl sitting with her. I have noticed that when my friend and I are talking she pays attention to us. I remember she also told her filipina friend that she liked something about me. My friend is one of those loud and witty guys that always gets girls. So he strategically started talking to her friend, another girl in her 20s today when she came into the cafeteria on break. He's interested in this girl but he wants to help me get the girl I like. But I didn't say a single thing to this girl. But I'm amazed at how that girl kept lingering and wanted the conversation to keep going. I really wish I had that talent. He said the most mundane things in funny ways and she kept laughing and shyly stoody around. When I was quiet he nudged me with his leg for me to talk to her. But I never did.
Are people just born with knowing how to talk to people they don't know. When I'm with my friend I'm confident and we freely talk. But it's different with women I don't know

Im a smallnosecel

Big red nose, with occasional acne even at 30+ and blackheads-cel. Without it I'd probably be a chad-lite, but a lifetime off this affliction has completely warped my mind and self-esteem to the point that I don't even want to get it fixed. I just want to get away from everyone and be left alone.

The classical chinlet and jawlet type.

Bad genes generally. Asymmetrical face. Bad skin. Low testosterone during puberty.

Meanwhile, Turkey's Mehmet Ozurek holds the record for the world's longest nose of a living person male. Two years ago, Guinness World Records confirmed this record and his nose measured 3.46 inches.

This. Having a big nose doesn't matter for men, having a small nose is actually a death sentence.
<comment>
nosecel cope. look at male models and actors, they mostly have either small or medium well shaped noses. imagine brad Pitt with a huge hook nose lmao
<comment>
David Gandy and Sean Opry have big noses. If you have a big chin it will balance out the big nose.
<comment>
I have a phenotype that usually correlates with a large hooked nose but my nose is tiny, it just looks wrong.
<comment>
big nose is actually the "best" worst thing to have. Having receded chin, lack of jawbone, terrible eye area or scarred facial skin are way worse.

i suffer from a condition called "currycel"
<comment>
It's also the easiest and cheapest to fix. Jaw surgery can take months of recovery and result in loss of feeling in the face.

literally is part of the internet algorithm which can be then monetized for a ridiculously retarded feature and as a result, gain capital.
You don't even fucking know if he's got the largest nose in the world since it's not like they have to legitimize that information, this is journalism 101, and with the person involved, he's going to get enough economical leverage for the time being to get somewhere in life compared to a fucking bland person because he's not part of the equivalently larger economical stream. He can betabux and not go homeless, GG EZ.
Stop being such a fucking ape, i thought this was r9k not an echochamber for monkeys

He lives in a small town in Turkey and was married before winning the World record.

Mehmet Ozyurek (born 17 October 1949) is a Turkish Guinness World Record holder. He has been confirmed as having the world's longest recorded nose.[1] His nose measured 8.8 cm (3.55 inches) when it was last measured on 18 March 2010. It was remeasured in both 2020 and 2021 disproving the myth that a person's nose and ears continue to grow as you get older. [2] He lives in Artvin, Turkey. Mehmet was bullied by his friends for his nose when younger, but later in life he came to the belief it was a blessing from God. [3] He also claims to have a better sense of smell than the average person and is able to inflate a balloon with his nose.

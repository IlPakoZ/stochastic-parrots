I don't like that something exists, I get jealous that I didn't make it and bitter that I haven't yet made it; I don't like the person that I am anymore and these feelings are involuntary, what do I do?

You simply have to realize more is possible than people or yourself think but it's a double edged sword in reality, but that's the right way to look at it. A lot of it is learning the hard way.
lucas made like 10billion in the end off star wars or whatever but boom musk loses 3 in an accident, people are just insanely powerful, what stops them? The dark side does. You simply have to convert evil into good, but that's the power of evil that you're forced to build around it or whatever, it's all in your head and your head is something else. 
A lot of it is self betrayal that's the real enemy but I believe it can be overcome nomatter how deep it is perceived and ultimately it's because that's how we get power over eachother through these systems but then we're limited...and greatly limited too but for a reason.

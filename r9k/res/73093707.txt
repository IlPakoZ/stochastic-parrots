so I've got these cigarette burns all over my hands
do you fags got any worthwhile excuses as to why and how I could've gotten them? (they're months old by now and I haven't burned myself in ages)
I'm only asking because warm weather is coming and I cant' wear long sleeves for much longer, any suggestion is much appreciated
and no, I probably won't burn myself anymore
<comment>
maybe people bumped into you, I have like 3 burns from people bumping into me
 I cant' wear long sleeves for much longer
I don't think you should worry about wearing a short sleeve, nobody really looks at arms that much and if they do they won't say anything about it

maybe people bumped into you
I have a fucking triangle of burns, how could I explain that? (I was drunk when doing it)
and if they do they won't say anything about it
this is my main cope too, but the people who "care about you" are bound to ask some questions because it's "weird"

your hands
i don't understand, you self harm on your hands? or you fell asleep while smoking?
<comment>
yes, I harmed my hands with burning cigarettes while I was drunk
4 of the burns were done by this girl while we were out together (I burned her too, we both regretted it shortly after, although not really (at least not me))
3 of the burns are in a triangle, done by me alone, when I was drunk, alone and depressed af
anything else to clear up for you?

passive aggressive faggot. i advise that next time you don't self harm in patterns on clearly visible parts of your body like a retard.
<comment>
oh I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings?
next time you don't self harm in patterns on clearly visible parts of your body like a retard
as I said in a post right above yours; I was fucking drunk af and wasn't thinking with my head, hence this whole retarded thread

no wonder she was the first responder to my thread then, fucking bitch. god I hate women so much. probably a fat bitch too, no wonder she's seeking for orbiters on fucking r9k of all places
She has attention from simping beta robot orbiters
I guess it's a symbiotic relationship then, they both get what they want
this bitch got any pics or what?
cause if not, she's definitely a fat ugly tranny

Of course she was the first respondent.
 Gets to fuckin tripfag

 Maybe 1 new orbiter
 Plays nice act so you fall for her
 Hurr durr not like other bitches you gaiz

<comment>
if you (or other anons) got her pics feel free to post them so we can make fun of her and make her feel like shit
and to reiterate; god, I fucking hate women so much, fuck all you stupid sluts
also, can someone spoonfeed me on the "smells fishy" meme?

I am the original co-author of the song.
 I came up with the idea
 I wrote my idea for lyrics using the melody of jingle bells calling it Pixel Smells.
 Talented guitar anon took my lyrics and made a song while he improvised, improved and added his personal touch to the rest of the lyrics (second half of Pixel's theme song)
Guitar anon was never identified.
Fuck you Pixel.

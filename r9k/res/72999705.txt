Do you mind seeing MTF trannies posted on your straight porn sites? Like would you be okay with trannies being posted like regular women in coomer communities you browse where people post beautiful women, tranny boobs being posted amongst real women's boobs, or tranny feet posted amongst female feet if you're a footfag, etc? Would you mind it if it's a passing tranny? Do you only want to see cis women?

I'm into trannies, but I think they should have their own category. I don't care if some see it as discrimination. I don't really mind seeing it in the same category, but I don't want to see gay porn so I can understand why others wouldn't want to see tranny porn.
b-but traps are gay!
I don't care, you know what I mean.

I would rather it was the other way around and that regular cis women were posted on tranny sites. I think that would be better because it would keep bigots contained to their dying cis only sites whereas progressive trans inclusive sites would blow up in popularity and become the new normal without any drama or backlash.

This was my thinking on it too as a guy who just watches either lesbian porn or tranny stuff.
I just like having clearly delineated categories.
I'd feel the same way about not wanting to see white girls if I had the filter on for latinas. Doesn't mean white girls aren't female, just that they weren't the kind of female I wanted to jerk off to at that point in time.

I don't want to see them at all, and I hate how they keep invading these spaces. I am heterosexual, that means I am attracted to the opposite sex. It's as simple as that.

The fact that all porn sites have a pretty solid barrier between normal, faggot and tranny shit should tell you the answer. They know full well how lowering those barriers would cause an exodus to other sites.

I don't go to "straight porn sites", but yeah, real women only.

I've noticed a few tranny videos seeping through to straight xvideos and pornhub every now and then, it's only a matter of time before it's commonplace.
And before people say that these websites curate what they show to each specific viewer, I know that. I never click on anything trans related, but I still occasionally see it in thumbnails or in titles.

I absolutely do mind, which is why I have a preference for russian pornography sites because outside of that being my type they seem to understand straight men dont like seeing tranny stuff, passing or otherwise. Hell Im even repulsed seeing it on here even though its incredibly common. Worth noting Im a footfag and even dislike seeing male feet, and if Im watching straight porn I prefer the man wears socks. Guess I must be picky

Bro how do you even tell male and female feet apart, they look identical

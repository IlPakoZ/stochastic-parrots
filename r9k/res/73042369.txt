If I'm into cryptid hunting, will girls think it's cool or lame?
Girls are bipolar so anything could be cool or lame given the context and physical attraction.
I don't know about cryptid hunting but I do urban exploration and girls think it's cool. I took a girl to check out an abandoned hospital once and we got jumpscared by a random homeless dude and she got so scared that she kept her face buried in my tshirt until I dropped her off at her apartment.
Lame anon, just say you like to go bushwhacking you're doing the same thing but people will think you're healthy and well developed instead of autistic.
simple yet cool design there

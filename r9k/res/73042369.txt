If I'm into cryptid hunting, will girls think it's cool or lame?

Girls are bipolar so anything could be cool or lame given the context and physical attraction.

I don't know about cryptid hunting but I do urban exploration and girls think it's cool. I took a girl to check out an abandoned hospital once and we got jumpscared by a random homeless dude and she got so scared that she kept her face buried in my tshirt until I dropped her off at her apartment.

Lame anon, just say you like to go bushwhacking you're doing the same thing but people will think you're healthy and well developed instead of autistic.

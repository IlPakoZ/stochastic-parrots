I am scared of the outside and it shows, every time I go outside I look like a cornered animal.

This gave me a half-chub for some reason.

Same here anon. I've been told by coworkers, friends, and even a complete stranger I look like a lost puppy. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to respond to that.

Yeah, I'd only go out if I could hold somebody's hand the entire time

my parents..
god i wish someone could hold my hand. just once.

are they open and helpful?
something i'm doing to beat agoraphobia is going by myself to the movies. my big brother will be there shopping at the mall while i do so, so i feel a little safer.
maybe something similar can help you become more confident.

it's not too late to feel better out there. exposure therapy for agoraphobia has helped me a lot and it will for you too, i'm certain. it's not good to feel scared all the time.

Yeah I like to bluff but I always mess up when there's a car and I have to cross the street because I can't read people or cars. I think I'm actually retarded.

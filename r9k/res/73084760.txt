I am scared of the outside and it shows, every time I go outside I look like a cornered animal.
me too, anon.
do you have a person to support you when you go out?
every time I go outside I look like a cornered animal
This gave me a half-chub for some reason.
Same here anon. I've been told by coworkers, friends, and even a complete stranger I look like a lost puppy. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to respond to that.
Yeah, I'd only go out if I could hold somebody's hand the entire time
my parents..
god i wish someone could hold my hand. just once.
are they open and helpful?
something i'm doing to beat agoraphobia is going by myself to the movies. my big brother will be there shopping at the mall while i do so, so i feel a little safer.
maybe something similar can help you become more confident.
i just stick to them like glue or try to hide behind them
it's not too late to feel better out there. exposure therapy for agoraphobia has helped me a lot and it will for you too, i'm certain. it's not good to feel scared all the time.
Yeah I like to bluff but I always mess up when there's a car and I have to cross the street because I can't read people or cars. I think I'm actually retarded.

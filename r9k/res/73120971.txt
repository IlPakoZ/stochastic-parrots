open up to a girl and it backfires again 
Not sure why I keep doing this to myself. I am not attractive enough for a girl to tolerate that sort of behavior.

never open up unless its to someone you genuinely care about. maybe a family member maybe your mom or dad. most people dont deserve your feelings anon

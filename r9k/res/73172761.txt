Who is your favorite mass murderer and why

Murder kills people and is wrong, retard

I'm partial to Adam Lanza. Total freak of the highest order, where we know just enough about what was going on in his head and during the shooting to be fascinating. Plus there's something to be said for the power of holding the elementary school high score, and, like all my favourite mass shooters, he killed himself before the cops could get to him.

This beast comes to mind. 
His videos really hit home and makes you realise even tough big guys like this are not immune to shitty life experiences.

Probably Cho. I dont know why but reading about his experiences at school and college and all his completely absurd writings and takes just makes me feel weird and sad, I could have saved him.

1. Elliot Rodger - relatable, interesting personality, started the beta uprising, memes, inspired many media producers, the Supreme Gentleman
2. Randy Stair - somewhat relatable, interesting personality
3. Alek Minassian - somewhat relatable, inspired by Elliot Rodger
4. Chris Harper-Mercer - somewhat relatable, inspired by Elliot Rodger
5. Adam Lanza - kind of interesting
6. Eric Harris &amp; Dylan Klebold - the classics who started it all
7. Seung-Hui Cho - interesting person and very successful
8. Valery Fabrikant - tried to save academia from death, now does research from prison which is kinda based
9. Dylann Roof - that late-'90s aesthetic
10. Vladislav Roslyakov - mildly interesting, inspired by the Columbine kids

Note: saying someone is "relatable" or "interesting" doesn't mean I'm going to copy them. I'm not.

Hands down Elliot Rodger. He was the supreme gentleman after all. I feel he was before his time though. I sometimes think about him &amp; wonder what life would have been like if he would have not done what he did and instead chose to create an army of like-minded people.

My favourite has already been mentioned (The Supreme Gentleman) so I'll say my least favourite, picrel. 
objectively ugly, the OG chud
shitty motivation (le white nationalism? srsly?)
survived
targeted oldfag nobodies
I'm just talking hypothetically here, I don't condone the acts of any mass murderer, chud or not. They are horrible people who comitted heinous crimes, it's just that some of them have more "appeal" or "charm" than others. I can stomach listening to Stefan Molyneux reading Elliot Rodger's manifesto but if picrel had something similar I wouldn't be interested.

He would have faded into obscurity no? he wasn't good at anything and wasn't that popular while alive. He was lolcow potential at most

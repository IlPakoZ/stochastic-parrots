I have a dentist appointment but I'm not gonna go
Care to elaborate on why not?
well at least cancel it or they'll charge you
I'm pretty antisocial but the dentist is weirdly chill for me. I just kinda detach myself from what's going on and most of the dentists/nurses don't wanna talk unless you carry convo with them.
Because I lost sleep over it
It's too late
It's so tiresome
chewy dentist finger
You need to go. I got an infection near my wisdom teeth once and it was hell on earth.
i have work tomorrow but i dont think im gonna bother going in.
Every day, less reason to get out of bed.
Same, gonna stay home and eat
if you go then they might give you free stuff like a tooth brush or toothpaste

I see a dentist several times a year but probably haven't been to a doctor since I was a kid

I have a dentist appointment but I'm not gonna go
<comment>
Care to elaborate on why not?
<comment>
well at least cancel it or they'll charge you

I'm pretty antisocial but the dentist is weirdly chill for me. I just kinda detach myself from what's going on and most of the dentists/nurses don't wanna talk unless you carry convo with them.

Because I lost sleep over it
It's too late
It's so tiresome

You need to go. I got an infection near my wisdom teeth once and it was hell on earth.

Every day, less reason to get out of bed.

I see a dentist several times a year but probably haven't been to a doctor since I was a kid

Good. They're all scammers and torturers like the rest of the medical industry

There is no reason not to. It's the secret weapon of men that's been long forgotten at this point. Women fear it above all else. It's what's kept them in line for thousands of years prior.
I wish Asian women (from Asia, Asian Americans have A1 feet) would take better care of their feet. They have so much potential. Ah well. Mestizas will remain #1 in the foot game.
broski, that is some felony level shit. your neighbors can call the police unprovoked and you will be court ordered to be separated, without evidence. happens all the itme. they will put a restraining order on you, even if your girl doesnt complain
that shit isnt happening. im not even sure if its legal to say you fantasize about doing that
thats how ingrained feminism is in the laws. you have to be delusional and unreasonable to do that shit, honestly
thats why all these stockholm syndrome love relationships are just pipe dreams. you got your feminist utopia
if only there was a man masculine enough to beat me when i misbehave
I don't think men should aggressively LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES to beat women. The "don't hit women principle" is valid to a limited extent, like you shouldn't hit women if you're not in mortal danger.
I think maybe what we should do is keep the "don't hit women principle" intact but also expect women to adhere to some kind of moral standards exchange for this treatment. Like, we say, "you don't hit a Lady," where 'Lady' is defined in the traditional way (modestly dressed, polite, submissive, etc). But if she fails in these standards she is no longer a 'Lady' but a mere 'female' and thus subject to beatings.

What's your trauma response?
flightchad reporting in
A bit from each column, I don't think it's as clearly defined as it is in your picrel
Freeze and having to fight my way out of it somehow. It's hell. I hate being scared.
i guess fight is most of mine
Freeze, then flight.
Flight 80% of the time and fight 20%.
most of the time i freeze. like legit i cant move.
Op here. For me my natural state is freeze. Inability to act and dissociation. Nothing can hurt me, but nothing can make me happy either.
If I try to actively fight and face myself I become compulsive and agitated. So flight.
For some reason I like this experience way more. I at least feel something.
Is giving up the same as freeze? If so, freeze
All and none, depends the day and time.
freeze then flight when i snap back
Fight. I'm shit at running
Mostly freeze, fawn when in any sort of social situation, and occasionally flight.
fight but freeze due to so much anger that i dont want to lash it all out in one go since it would be bad for me
Used to be a fawner, never fucking again. I fucking hate people with a passion now.
When the Knights of Saint Iris the Martyr defeated the master of illusions, his/her rebellious followers exhibited a strong flight response to the trauma.
FUCK FAWNING, I FUCKING HATE FAWN
eighty percent freeze 
twelve percent fight 
seven percent fawn
one percent flight

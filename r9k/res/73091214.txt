Freeze and having to fight my way out of it somehow. It's hell. I hate being scared.

i guess fight is most of mine

Freeze, then flight.

Flight 80% of the time and fight 20%.

Op here. For me my natural state is freeze. Inability to act and dissociation. Nothing can hurt me, but nothing can make me happy either.
If I try to actively fight and face myself I become compulsive and agitated. So flight.
For some reason I like this experience way more. I at least feel something.

All and none, depends the day and time.

Mostly freeze, fawn when in any sort of social situation, and occasionally flight.

fight but freeze due to so much anger that i dont want to lash it all out in one go since it would be bad for me

Used to be a fawner, never fucking again. I fucking hate people with a passion now.

When the Knights of Saint Iris the Martyr defeated the master of illusions, his/her rebellious followers exhibited a strong flight response to the trauma.

No, assuming you're working to improve yourself, and rectify the failings in your life that have led to you being a 24 year old khv. Education/career advancement, getting in shape, picking up a hobby, or whatever you need to do. You're at the age where you can lean into social anxiety, mental illness, or whatever as an acceptable reason when it comes up with a future partner. 
If all you're doing is posting on /r9k/ about it, you're fucked though. But it's not too late to change things.

After that being normal is out of question.

was acused of being gay by a girl I didn't wanna date
again
Every time. Why do they never think the problem is with them?

God damn my wife is really pretty and all (which I'm grateful for) but holy shit when I see a literal 10/10 I get jealous that I won't be able to take her virginity and marry her instead.

Because that'd require introspection on their part. Which they won't do. It's just like when guys get furious when they shoot their shot and get rejected

I've literally never had a girl ask me on a date or anything similarly direct. There was one girl who I retrospectively believe liked me, but I was very autistic and didn't realize it.

what the actual fuck? i know it's not jealousy, because she turned me down. so why is she fucking with me while pretending to be my friend?
pretty sure that's called a woman moment
is it because of their stupidity or because they're just evil ? pick your poison
i mean since youre posting on r9k about her she actually read you like a book lmao
I would make it my mission in life going forward to contrive a way to get her fired and/or arrested, if possible.
I'm actually a /sp/ee and /tv/ poster and you cant bitch about this sort of stuff there
Insane levels of narcissism are not uncommon in women. Tending towards hating or loving something based on how it suits them with little objectivity or other reasoning and with casual disregard for other people, often very observable in a lack of manners (manners are one of the biggest flags in a relationship). You gave her the ick so she sees you as dirt and will spread petty gossip about you.

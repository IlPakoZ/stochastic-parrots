OK, but we men have all the money. And yes, that includes in those cities where women brag about how young women out-earn young men--the women are student debt pwned and can't save shit. Lol.
If you want to think about who is more "dependent" on who, men or women, think about what would happen if the sexes segregated. Moved to different parts of the world. Sure men wouldn't reproduce but they'd have several DECADES of living comfortably. The women would be dead in MONTHS, if not WEEKS.
Shut up idiot moid
We also have sprem which creates life
NEVER FORGET THEY STILL NEEED OUR SPREM BUT WE WON'T NEED THEM WITH THE ARTIFICIAL WOMB
I ask you the question AGAIN: women move to their own country, men to theirs. No contact allowed. WHICH COUNTRY LASTS LONGER? Obviously, neither one reproduces, but at least the men know how to harvest resources. Women are getting preyed on by hyenas and bears within weeks LEL.
supply and demand. pussy is in record levels of high demand but for the average man its in incredibly low supply. this makes the value of pussy skyrocket. that in turn creates a ton of simping and women worshiping, further increasing the value of pussy.
correct but your brain puts you into distress over not getting pussy, its hard to win over your own brains hard wiring.
My last HR lady "questioned my skills at (insert high profile place here) and my skills as a janitor".
That was quite a blow to what I thought I had been doing right.
It should be illegal to be treated like shit by HR, but what do I know about employment laws, I was basically their slave. I won unemployment anyway because even them firing me was a cunt move. I should actually sue them, but I again, know nothing about employment laws, as I was nothing but a slave.
The point was imagine this but on a major level and it's silent judgement
Didn't someone make a dating app profile of her and since she's a girl she got tons of responses anyway?
CUZ IF U KNEW UR WORTH U WOULD BE A WORSE SLAVE
THE IDEAL CONSOOMER IS A PERPETUALLY SUICIDAL DEPRESSED TRANNY LIVING IN A CITY WORKING A DESK JOB

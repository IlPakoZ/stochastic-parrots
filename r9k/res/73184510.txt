I work in a hotel and can almost immediately tell if someone is a rich. The guys are taller, and so are their frat pals, and unlike working class Chads who have a certain ease with them, the trust fund kids always have this bewildered look in their eyes?.
SSRI's dude
good looking people are more likely to be successful
are ssris like a pain or mood thing, straight up look like a deer
Is that the dude who got sentanced to 30 years in jail for running over a mother and her 1 year old daughter while drunk or something?
They should free him hes too cute for prison.
Rich parents put their sons on drugs and various expensive treatments to ensure they grow up to be tall. Could be related to that.

Eye widening takes in more light and improves your vision. It's either fear, shock, or predation
rich people buy good looking partners and breed. that's literally it

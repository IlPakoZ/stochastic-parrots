tfw no brown tomboy glasses girl who would never ever look twice at you
<comment>
optimist with a lot of hidden self-doubt. dreams big but will inevitably become something boring like a dental hygienist. has 2 pet ferrets that she loves more than anything else in the world.
through her apartment window she has a great view of a local baseball club field. sometimes she likes to throw apple cores and small pebbles at the sportsmen during games. cynical.

just imagine this but less attractive, non anime hair, older looking, and with more acne and stubble
<comment>
Some sort of gamer gf?
So why the scars? But good.
Lol OK dude but a classic
Just all around creepy vibes man, I don't approve
Cute and simple, I like it
Pairing could work depending on your personalities I guess?
<comment>

<comment>
This one seems more on the nerdier side too. But good picks, comfy.
<comment>
Wow, she is perfect
<comment>
Maybe more black make up but I couldn't really find the option in the chara maker.
<comment>
Feels more anime waifu than real life, but you are onto something
Uh are you this guy?>>73186125
In any case, comfy 8/10. Looks nerdier but seems to know when to have fun
<comment>

I'm always thinking in some kind of skater girl with gaming interests because they were the unicorns back when I was young.
<comment>
He made himself so that's normal that's a dude, whish he could've posted his ideal gf tho
<comment>
determined go-getter with a journalism degree. very perceptive, always knows when people are lying to her. feels most at home when feeding ducks in a park
sounds very specific, is this based on someone irl?
more like a conglomeration of many dirty scrappy punks with bad diy dye jobs that i've known and crushed on. 
why do you want to be a tim burton character
i have terminally bad taste :)
koreaboo &amp; a weeb, but in a classy way. drinks a lot of ~aesthetic~ drinks. reads self insert fanfiction about kpop boys being gang leaders
So why the scars?
I like to think she scales barbed wire fences regularly but has poor balance. i have to patch her up and kiss her better
her landlord doesn't let her keep pets so she became a dogwalker to sate her love of canines. was a furry in her youth but grew out of it. everyone sees her as extremely calm and chill but has written some of the most snarky goodreads reviews on earth.
knows how to drive a tractor but is ashamed of knowing. aspiring e-girl. definitely has an onlyfans
<comment>
Yeah it's not as niche as it once was. What are you like? Just to see how comfy you two would look.
<comment>
Oh sorry I answer too fast without reading.
<comment>
What makes you say Koreaboo and weeb? That's reallly interesting tho
<comment>
Np my guy
<comment>
the round glasses and that specific shade of hair are quite popular in what i've seen of korean fashion.
<comment>
Huh I didn't know that, but I did really like a koreaboo &amp; weeabo once damn. You know stuff. Any experiences to share?
<comment>
like experiences with that kind of woman? not really - i'm just on the outskirts of a lot of different communities and have known a lot of different people.
<comment>
Hmm what so you think about this one?
<comment>
Or this one here, without glasses?
<comment>
anxious people pleaser who wants to live a nomadic lifestyle in a fancy camper van. listens to a lot of electronic music. chugs coffee by the gallon

Why do people still use these picrew when you can just use AI now?
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
I mean talk a bit about your ideal gfs there
<comment>
coming to the sad realization he doesnt and will never exist
<comment>
Pretty good one, got a link for that picrew?
<comment>
But I exist in a state which involves having messy dark hair, glasses and a tired face.
<comment>
he kinda goofy so it checks out
he likes orange/auburn haired women. but also me which is weird since i don't and makes my cognitive dissonance go off.
<comment>

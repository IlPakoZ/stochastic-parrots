Huh I didn't know that, but I did really like a koreaboo &amp; weeabo once damn. You know stuff. Any experiences to share?
like experiences with that kind of woman? not really - i'm just on the outskirts of a lot of different communities and have known a lot of different people.
Hmm what so you think about this one?
Or this one here, without glasses?

I'm basically 100% Anglo. I even have the classic blond hair and blue eyes.
Is it weird that I consider most other white americans not white? Feels like I'm surrounded by people who are mixed race, just majority "white" and not actually a bunch of white people.
<comment>
Problem:
No perfect anglo society
Solution:
You already know what it is.
<comment>
You know that English people themselves were literally just a bunch of once distinct white peoples coming together under a single language and identity and mixing in the early Middle Ages, right. 
How is the formation of white Americans any different to that.
<comment>
Most whites seem to believe that they are more white than their peers.

100% Anglo
Doesnt exist
British are celtic, french, norse, med mutts
<comment>
Yeah this. Anglo Saxons were an amalgam of German French Dutch and Danish tribes. There were people already living in the UK at that time such as the Celts and Brythonic and Beaker people, and they ended up mixing. And those people were themselves immigrants from mainland Europe and already mixed with ancient Britons like Cheddar man who they had mostly eradicated. Then they got invaded by Vikings and Romans. Everyone in Europe is a mutt basically.

Everyone in Europe is a mutt basically.
Everyone near anywhere of any importance in the last 10000 years is too. Everything's been conquered and reconquered twenty times over since the dawn of civilization.
There's a few pockets of people on islands near Africa/India that basically settled there 90000+ years ago, never left, were never bothered by outsiders and their phenotype is almost identical to the earliest homo sapiens' skeletons.

That's literally every European ethnic group. God you're fucking stupid.
<comment>
No, Anglo-Saxons are, as the name implies, the mix of two Germanic tribes named accordingly. There are no Anglo-Saxons today, because after coming to Britain they have mixed with the local celts, then with the vikings, then normans etc
<comment>
English just means people who speak English. Same as German and Spanish and Italian and Norwegian and Russian and every other ethnic group. 
Almost every single ethnic group is of mixed genetic ancestry. And most of the ones who have achieved anything worth a damn in history are very mixed. 
I honestly don't get why the English get tarred with this mutt brush when groups like Germans and Italians and many others are far more heterogeneous than the English (just look at their PCA spread).
<comment>
the mix of two Germanic tribes named accordingly.
They weren't though. There were Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Frisians and others. And then many other later Germanic tribes came from Scandinavia and mixed with them further. They all came under the language and identity of a single Germanic tribe, the Angles. 
There are no Anglo-Saxons today
Yeah there are their cultural descendants, the English-speaking people. 
because after coming to Britain they have mixed with the local celts, then with the vikings, then normans etc
By that logic no historical ethnic group exists today. 
Scandinavians aren't the descendants of Norsemen because they have mixed heavily with neighboring groups since the Viking Age. 
Is that something you agree with?
Germans aren't actually Germans anymore. Because the Germanic tribes there mixed heavily with Celtic, Slavic, Italic and far more exotic peoples since the Roman era. 
Is that something you agree with?

Is this chart even accurate anymore? I thought they found that Yamnaya were R1B and nothing to do with R1A Corded Ware. Latvians and Lithuanians and Finns are Corded ware, not yamnaya.
<comment>

No. R1b-L151 is Corded Ware. Yamnaya was a different subclade of R1b. You're way, way, way fucking behind. 
You're like a decade behind. 
Latvians and Lithuanians and Finns are Corded ware, not yamnaya.
So are Western Europeans. R1b-L151 was a major haplogroup within Corded Ware. Along with R1a. They also had other types of Y-DNA too. 
Steppe peoples were generally a mix of R1b, R1a, Q and other types of Y-DNA.

English people, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages:[36] Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from a Cro-Magnon population that arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago;[37] Neolithic farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago;[38] and Yamnaya Steppe pastoralists who expanded into Europe from the Pontic-Caspian steppe in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.[36]
Recent genetic studies have suggested that Britain's Neolithic population was largely replaced by a population from North Continental Europe characterised by the Bell Beaker culture around 2400 BC, associated with the Yamnaya people from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. This population lacked genetic affinity to some other Bell Beaker populations, such as the Iberian Bell Beakers, but appeared to be an offshoot of the Corded Ware single grave people, as developed in Western Europe.[39][40] It is currently unknown whether these Beaker peoples went on to develop Celtic languages in the British Isles, or whether later Celtic migrations introduced Celtic languages to Britain.[41]
The close genetic affinity of these Beaker people to Continental North Europeans means that British and Irish populations cluster genetically very closely with other Northwest European populations, regardless of how much Anglo-Saxon and Viking ancestry was introduced during the 1st millennium.

Yamnaya were R1B and nothing to do with R1A Corded Ware.
What do you mean by 'nothing to do with'. They were effectively autosomally so similar that people believed for years that Corded Ware inherited 75% of its ancestry from Yamnaya. Only recently have they established that Corded Ware inherited its ancestry from a 'Yamnaya-like population' and not Yamnaya itself. 
Ultimately Yamnaya and Corded Ware DO share ancestry, it's just a matter of how far back you go. 
Ultimately all humans share ancestry of course.
But the R1b in Western Europe doesn't come from Yamnaya, if that's what you're suggesting. It comes from Corded Ware culture.
<comment>
Is that something you agree with? 
Yes, there are no Anglo-Saxon people, only English people (as in people who speak the language, live in England, and identify themselves as such), there are no Germanic people, only German people. The only places where you can maybe find ethnic groups that barely changed are remote villages with thousands of years of inbreeding.
<comment>
Is this chart even accurate anymore?
If you google image search Steppe ancestry percentage maps of Europe. They all show very similar levels of Steppe ancestry in modern Europeans. 
Yamnaya and Corded Ware were both mostly of 'Steppe ancestry'. Saying they have nothing to do with each other is... like claiming Angles and Saxons had nothing to do with each other. It makes no sense. 
They were extremely closely genetically related groups. It's just that Corded Ware didn't DIRECTLY descend from Yamnaya as was originally thought. It's more like both Corded Ware and Yamnaya descended from a fairly recent common ancestral population on the Eurasian Steppe. 
Talking about R1b and R1a is ridiculous. We're talking about autosomal ancestral components. Total genomic modelling. There are black Americans with R1a and R1b and I1. They're not Europeans. They can still be like 95% West African autosomally and look coal black but carry European Y-DNA through founder effect. 
But even just talking about Y-DNA exclusively. R1b and R1a are both just subclades of R1. You get that, right? They both from from an ancient mammoth hunting culture in Siberia and most tribes on the Steppe would have been a mix of R1b and R1a because originally R1 was a single Y-DNA that would have mutated randomly within a population. 
Nobody would have instinctively perceived that their Y-DNA had mutated to R1b or R1a. It doesn't work that way. 
Every group of people. Every tribe. They're all a mix of all different Y-DNA and even more diverse mtDNA. 
Because humans don't operate by things they cannot perceive like Y-DNA. They operate on things like common language, common appearance (how strict that is depends on the groups themselves), common traditions, common geographic proximity.

Yes, there are no Anglo-Saxon people
I asked if you agree there are no Norse people today. And if there are no Germanic people today. Because Norse people mixed heavily with others and their modern cultural descendants are quite different genetically and culturally to the Norsemen themselves. 
Germanic peoples have all mixed heavily with other groups since the Roman era and their languages and cultures and genetics have diversified and changed greatly. 
So do Norse people and Germanic people no longer exist? Is that what you're saying?
<comment>
only English people
You understand Anglo-Saxons generally referred to themselves as 'English', right. That's what they called themselves and their language. English. They didn't refer to themselves as 'Anglo-Saxons', at least not commonly.
<comment>
Corded ware were overwhelmingly R1A with only tiny percentages of R1B, how did the entirety of Western Europe become majority R1B?
<comment>
there are no Germanic people
Germanic people are people who speak Germanic languages as their main language. By default, there are hundreds of millions of Germanic people today.
<comment>
Its still inaccurate to say Balts and Finns and Slavs are yamnaya.
<comment>
Corded ware were overwhelmingly R1A with only tiny percentages of R1B
Well over 1/3 of Corded Ware samples have been R1b-L151 by this point. It's a major lineage associated with Corded Ware Culture, along with R1a and assimilated I. 
how did the entirety of Western Europe become majority R1B?
The Bell Beaker culture was a Corded Ware offshoot. From the Single Grave Culture. They carried exclusively R1b-L151 because it was a small group of men from Corded Ware who decided to colonize the West.
I already explained this in an earlier comment.
<comment>
It's not really:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corded_Ware_culture#Genetic_studies
I think you should take this as a lesson in life not to speak about things you're clearly very unsure of and not very educated on or up to date on. 
Do you think that's a reasonable suggestion? You're clearly not a very bright man.

The majority of CWC-men carried haplogroup R1a-M417, the remaining ones R1b and I2a.[63] Note that, although related to the Corded Ware population, Yamnaya males mainly carried R1b-Z2103, while R1b-bearing Corded Ware males had R1b-L51, suggesting that Corded Ware culture males cannot be directly patrilineally descended from Yamnaya individuals.[e] Yet, Linderholm et al. (2020) found seven CW males which were narrowed down to either R1b-M269 or R-L11,[65] while Allentoft et al. (2015) report two CW males with R1b,[1] and Furtwangler et al. (2020) report three CW males with R1b.[66] According to Sjogren et al. (2020), R1b-M269 is the major lineage associated with the arrival of Steppe ancestry in western Europe after 2500 BC[E].
For the record. There have only been like 30 or so Corded Ware Culture Y-DNA samples extracted and documented. Well over a third of them have been R1b. 
Corded Ware Culture would probably have looked a lot like modern Scandinavians in terms of Y-DNA, being a threeway split of R1b, R1a and I. With possibly less I back then.
From what I understand R1b was originally more dominant among early Corded Ware Culture, whereas R1a began to predominate over time. This was likely due to institutionalized kingship. Basically an R1a royal lineage became dominant among Corded Ware peoples and had enhanced reproductive success and breeding rights. 
Or it could have been totally random. People carrying that specific subclade of R1a might just have been more attractive or stronger or whatever than the R1b-L151 and other men within Corded Ware. 
Or it could have been later migrations from R1a rich Steppe populations that sort of eroded the R1b within Corded Ware or pushed them west. 
We don't know exactly. 
What we do know is you find significant minorities of R1b among every R1a dominant population today. And you find minorities of R1a among almost every R1b dominant population today (albeit smaller than the R1b in R1a countries).

"Germanic" is only used to describe either the ancient tribes or those languages that originated from the languages these tribes spoke. As such "Germanic people" have no relevance in the modern context. 
Only germanic-speaking people.

how did the entirety of Western Europe become majority R1B?
Western Europe was a lot more sparsely populated and less economically appealing than Central and Eastern Europe in these times. You need to remember Western Europe was just the Atlantic and nothing. 
R1b-L151 effectively wiped out the Y-DNA in Western Europe. In southwestern Europe it's largely through founder effect to add insult to injury. 
Founder effect is basically a tiny group of men basically rape the everloving shit out of Neolithic women and then their rapebaby descendants continue to rape everyone and replace the Y-DNA through a continual thinning of the blood. 
That's why despite fairly similar levels of R1b Y-DNA, southern Europeans are autosomally much less similar to British Isles people than, say, Scandinavians and Dutch people are.
<comment>
As such "Germanic people" have no relevance in the modern context.
Only germanic-speaking people.
That's what the term meant in ancient times too. It meant Germanic-speaking tribes. 
Germanic-speaking tribes were mixed in ancestry and genetics, even back in the Proto-Germanic era. 
They had all different Y-DNA and even more diverse mtDNA. And different Germanic tribes had different ratios of Y-DNA and mtDNA. 
Germanic has literally always meant 'Germanic-speaking'. It's an ethnolinguistic term. 
There is no 'Germanic race'. There is no 'Celtic race'. There is no 'Slavic race'. These terms have always been rooted in language. 
Germanic is as relevant a term today as it was in ancient times.
<comment>
And different Germanic tribes had different ratios of Y-DNA and mtDNA.
Some were more R1b heavy. Some were more R1a heavy. Some were more I heavy. The Proto-Germanic language is centum Indo-European. It (the language which would become Proto-Germanic) was ultimately brought into Scandinavia by men carrying R1b-L151. 
They conquered and assimilated men already living there carrying R1a who themselves had conquered and enslaved men carrying I.
<comment>
Papac et al. (2021) argue that the differences in Y-DNA between early CW and Yamnaya males suggest that the Yamnaya culture did not have a direct role in the origins and expansion of the Corded Ware culture.[6] They found that a majority of early Corded Ware males in Bohemia belonged to R1b-L151, while R1a lineages became predominant over time.[6] The study detected a reduction in male haplogroup diversity over time, reducing from five different lineages in early CW to a single dominant lineage, R1a-M417(xZ645), in late CW. The authors suggest that males of this haplogroup had around 15% more surviving offspring per generation compared to other males, which may have been caused by "selection, social structure, or influx of nonlocal R1a-M417(xZ645) lineages."[6] The sample included one individual ancestral to haplogroup R1b-P312, which is the most common male lineage found in individuals of the Bell Beaker culture
Does this stuff make sense to you yet?

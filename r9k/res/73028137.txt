Why are so many men turned on by boys dressed as girls but absolutely refuse to fuck masculine men?
<comment>
because that's gay. and if you want to fuck men irl that's gay. I want to fuck a 2d female that's drawn with a pp

I want to fuck a 3d female
Straight
that's drawn with a pp
see that's where you lose me, if you're so straight why is there a penis involved?

this is so retarded I just can't

I'm a robot and I'm willing to fuck and cuddle with a cute twink (male (male)) from this board.

Why would you want to be the bottom bitch?
<comment>
For what it's worth, I like both. Just as long as no women are involved.
<comment>
Because they're feminine and they try their hardest to be feminine. Modern women go out of their way to not look feminine, get ugly tattoo, ugly haircut, ugly clothes and ugly behavior.

Because we're straight whats so hard to understand
<comment>
Because masculine does the fucking, not getting fucked. 
If you want to get fucked you need to be small, cute and harmless

I mean I just don't want to fuck any man sluts with HIV and aids or whatever you get from gay sex
I'm so lonely though if a big lonely bara man with no/very few sexual encounters (preferably with not men) would be interested in me then maybe I would enjoy this relationship even though I'm not gay, it's just a decision to not put up with stupid women and a man could share my hobbies like anime and gym the way a woman almost always can't unless she's a one in 1000 rare girl

I have a theory it's a form of autogynophilia 
Because they get more sexual satisfaction from masturbation due to an addiction or an inability to be with a real partner their brain associates sexual arousal with male genitalia

I want to get fucked my a tall muscular dominating woman who would stuff my face with her huge tits and pick me up and choke me but I'm a 190cm fit tall guy so finding a woman stronger and bigger than me would be a miracle

I like soft flesh. Simple. Wish I could have a cushion made of it.

You realise the chemicals in the brains and shit is all made up by your brain itself and things like sexual attraction are decided by your brain with no choice from you? In this sense the
their brain associates sexual arousal with male genitalia
is the same as the brain assocaiting female sexual organs with arousal, but one behavior is learned while another is forced.

way to put exactly what I said into a blender and spit it back at me as if you made a counterpoint.

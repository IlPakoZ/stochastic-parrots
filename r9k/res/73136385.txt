I stumbled onto the Japanese kpop stan side of Instagram and its uhhhhh intense. These girls literally devote every waking moment to their oppa. Its literally a cult.
<comment>
it's certainly possible 
t. spiritual sex haver

No wonder anti Korean sentiment among young Japanese men is rising. 
Imagine being a sexless Nip incel meanwhile your women would rather literally worship Koreans than talk to you. 
Its over for Japbros.

If we needed further proof of the female genders insanity

How is this meaningfully different from waifufags?
<comment>
These girls are cute too. Wonder why they choose to become femsimps.
<comment>
Exactly lol. Men are hypocrites.

These girls are cute too.
How do you know? They're hiding their faces.

No one who has a waifu has the option to have anything other than a waifu.

They show them on their stories sometimes. In general Japs hide their faces on social media a lot. If you go on Japanese tinder, most girls, even the really cute ones, are hiding behind a profile pic of a cat or a plate of food or some other random shit, many japs seem to have a weird complex about hiding the face.

 Exactly lol. Men are hypocrites
Cute nip girls with options aren't like ugly retard waifufags

99% of waifufags do little more than jack off to porn of their waifu. Very low-effort, low-commitment shit.
Meanwhile, husbandofags will literally spend thousands building a goddamn shrine to their crush.

Dont explain it to them. Theyre literal melts

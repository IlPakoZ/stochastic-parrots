Why do the nicest people always turn out to be the most abusive?
Even guys who have such obvious red-flags from the start aren't nearly as abusive.
Sociopaths can seek out positions of authority
McManus was so non-threatening as a prison figurehead. Dude was about as intimidating as my high school history teacher.
Sounds like you are making shit up because you don't feel you have the capacity to return the niceness. You are making villian out a good person just to feel ok about being selfish.
if you expect niceness to be returned (or think it should be), then you're neither a nice person nor a good one.
If you think any of what you said proves what I said wrong then you are wrong. A person who does selfless acts must not expect anything in return but the receiver should have the shame and decency to return it. If I am extremely broke and some fellas gives me money expecting I will never be able to return it then it doesn't mean I must not return the money if I miraculously get some. Dumb autist you are.

American-level reading comprehension.
A person who does selfless acts must not expect anything in return
Correct (for the most part).
Congrats on being a shitty, selfish person, Anon.
I thought autists were supposed to be samrt or something. You disappoint me.
None of this is what any nice person would (generally) say.
When did I say I was a nice person lol
Where did that post say you were? Or any post ITT, for that matter?

im so high im backtracking my life and i moved around a lot my whole life and i hated living in toronto most of all
i live in toronto and this place is a hellish distopia
i visited it last october
people say its baby new york and i agree
i like living here. only place i've met many of the kind of weirdos i vibe with. but i get it about the high rents and how expensive everything is. and boy howdy if you're racist i can understand how the place would give you conniptions

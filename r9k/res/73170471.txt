I spent my 20s working while normies were out partying and having sex. I didn't have sex or a gf until I turned 33. Now I make $150,000 a year and own a home. I have no regrets.

Not a total disaster, you managed to make it barely. Had you said 30 it would be cucked

It took you until you're 33 to make 150k?
I'm 23, have a gf that I'm moving in with soon, and regularly party with my friends, and I make $94k. This is my first job out of college

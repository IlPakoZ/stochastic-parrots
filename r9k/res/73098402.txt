I want to by the use of a trigger word be turned into a giggling mess on the floor who wants nothing more than to be a good girl who wears panties and sucks cock. But I can't do it. Even now, when I stop being horny like this I have very little motivation to train myself to do such a thing and its only really exciting if I am truly not in control and brainwashed. 
I am asking for advice mainly as to how to best get into trance, how to stop myself from getting bored in the middle of a track, and how to stay motivated. Should I do nofap to stay a little horny all the time and have motivation?

Got a very ironic add for a post like this

in order to be fully brainwashed you should ideally never touch your penis again and only cum from anal. You need a chastity cage.

Should I still watch porn or should I try to only get turned on from hypnosis?

I did something similar to my ex without him knowing or his consent and he ended up having ED by the time I was finished. I planned on leaving him before I started, just wanted to ruin him for all other women that could come after me before I left lol.

what in particular did you do to give him ED besides chastity? Can he only cum like a girl now to this day?

literally just pretend. roleplay. kill yourself.

Convinced him to take SSRI's even though he only had minor anxiety. That was the main culprit of ED. No clue what has been going on with him, every time he tries to reach out I ignore it. I got into a new relationship like 2 months after I left him so he phased out of my mind quickly. He was a loser anyway.

He should be feminizing himself rn so later he can be in threesoms with you

Even if I were single or in a non monogamous relationship, would never have sex with him again. A broken dick is worthless. I am just glad I got my desire to abuse someone out of my system.

If you want to be hypnotized then you're already half way there. All that's left is truly surrendering yourself to your own desires. A person deteriorates when becoming a junkie to something and if you're a junkie for some sissy fantasy then you won't even need someone else because you'll do it to yourself.
Surrender to yourself. Your fetish. Your desire.

Also someone could be a junkie for anything. I live at home and my mum's a junkie for cigarettes. It influences her entire behaviour. 
She lies to my dad about not smoking, but I smoke myself and if she sees one in my hands then she wont even realize she hasn't taken her eyes off it until I hide it. Sissy hypno is just junkie shit.

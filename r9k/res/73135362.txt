I lost a good friend when I was 16 and now looking at my life at 27, I really wish it was me instead of him.
Try not to beat yourself up and think like this Anon, you are here because fate choose you to live and reflect on your friends life. 
You could take comfort that your friend is no longer suffering like the rest of us, and is free from the corruption that could have plagued their life.
Or you could take this moment to say "fuck it" I am gonna change everything an do it for yourself and your friend, also sorry for your loss

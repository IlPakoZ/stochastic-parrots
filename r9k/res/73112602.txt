If I go to college/uni I'll have much less time to do read manga, watch anime, play video games, play piano and do drugs
Just so in 10 years I'll have more money for those things (and I'll probably still have less time for them)
What is the point of all this work? After giving up on finding a gf all my motivation to earn money just vanished desu

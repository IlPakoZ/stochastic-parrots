This post sounds like it comes from one of those people who is in their 20s and still can't drive.

Society only functions if everyone follows the rules. The fact that 98% of people who drive cars don't die on a highway proves this.

I'm seriously considering revoking my status as a human that is related to these dumb npcs. Imagine for a second everyone living is homo erectus and i am a human.

You'd just better hope that nothing tremendously unprecedented happens, because then the system starts to collapse onto itself.
Most people can only drive on a basic level, and that's why there are as many accidents as there are. 
Many people genuinely don't have the level of driving skill to actually avoid a thing they don't expect happening
The fact that so many people don't even really realize that the left line is specifically for overtaking cars is a testament to this.

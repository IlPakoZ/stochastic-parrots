Was in town today overheard a conversation. Didnt get much of it but it went likethis
Im not being racist but...
thats absolute niggler
youll be shovelling shite all day
itll be a horrible job
not really sure of the context. was that a joke? was he being coy in his racism? was he referring to a foreign boss? who knows.

Probably somewhere easy like France on the Eurostar.

It's 300 quid return, how would you pay for it?

If youre a shutin its your fault tbqhwy. Go outside. Being a chud is playing the victim card
I want to be adored I want to be amazing but ill do nothing to work towards being more whole as a person
Chuds make themselves

I still think she is his carer tbqh. Either that or she is lonely af

Imagine being a complete shutin. must be hell. I feel like going insane after 3 or more days indoors. 2 starts to feel weird. even 1 is lazy feeling

She really deserves a great life. A good person with a good outlook on life. She will make the world a slightly better place.

At some point he'll have to meet someone face to face which he won't do. Covid would have been the perfect time for him to ease into the benny system since in person meetings were cancelled for a bit.
<comment>
I read about that. Last time they said I had to go in for an assessment and that was out of town. Imagine if I didn't know how to use a bus or train. It's totally discriminatory towards people with social anxiety.

<comment>
Good night lads. Was pretty decent thread tonight.
<comment>
I don't think I did. She was probably meaning to stop for a while to focus on her studies. It was all starting to feel stressful for her feeling the need to do something for free. She could do it still whenever she wants because 99% of people are supportive. She wouldn't just stop for a few bad apples.
<comment>
How the fuck do you even go about getting a job? Do you need a CV for everything? I'm looking at a "kitchen hand" position, do I give them a CV or just show up and be like "I have two hands and a semi-functional brain, can I have the job"?
<comment>
Goon night
<comment>
It's not harassment talking about someone here. That's all I do.
<comment>
Nah she would. You are in denial about this but it's obvious to everyone else that she stopped because you scared her
<comment>
semi-functional brain
I dunno lad, you hang out here
<comment>
It is if it bothers her. Its the implication that you know this too. Which you do. I think you'd get arrested if anyone bothered to explain the situation in depth. theyd at the minimum get in contact with ruth and ask her thoughts on the matter. if it turns out it is effecting her in a significant way is a straight forward process thereafter.

<comment>
I'm looking at a "kitchen hand" position
Where are you looking? If it's online, fill in whatever form it is.
<comment>
I do care. It's her choice. Only a few girls continue to make asmr for more than few years. A lot of them get bored and find new interests. She'll be taken advantage of her adult life now so will be going out more with friends and on holidays.
<comment>
It's not illegal to discuss someone here. Plus they would not waste resources on an American hosted site. Simply wouldn't be any viable evidence. I've done nothing wrong. I may have acted a bit weird at the worst.
<comment>
It's online, but the place is a five minute walk away. Is it good to just show up in person to ask about the job?
<comment>
It's not illegal
Your auditmong is showing. Doesn't make it nice or decent does it?
<comment>
I had a look out of curiosity. Azwa is a gamer and Abood is an Arabic guy heavily into planes.
<comment>
Nah it's because one of you left a comment about me. As if she would stop when 99% of people support her. Clearly she wants to focus on other things in life. She does not owe anyone anything.
<comment>
Listening to music from the Lord of the Rings and getting all emotional again
<comment>
Just fill out the online thing. If you show up there's a chance you'll be told to do it online anyway.
<comment>
She replied with "I know, I've seen it." 
And by "it", she meant you. You scared her. Doesn't matter if 99% of people support her, if one weirdo scared the shit out of her
<comment>
You forgot the :/
4chan is a scary place for most people, nevermind a teenage girl
<comment>
I doubt a few comments on her bothers her. She'd have to go out of her way to read those comments. There is no wrongdoing here. I may act a bit weird but I love her really. I only wanted to see what you guys think of this lovely person.
<comment>
Planes and arabs don't go well together do they?
<comment>
Abood is a more respectful fan than ruthmong
<comment>
It's obvious it did bother her from her own words and deeds.
<comment>
I am only obsessed with her. I don't mean no harm. I am a troubled person.

<comment>
I know I may have taken it a bit far but that's just because I am lonely. I've said a few silly things (someone else has impersonated me btw) but most of it is just comedic or praising her.
<comment>
I bet Abood has a fully countersigned passport
<comment>
inshallah the ferocious bully of kind ruth will be struck down and she will return to recording videos very pleasantly
<comment>
That could only happen if I broke the law, which I didn't. Even then it would be a difficult process to prove. She would not want all that hassle because I'd be claiming I'm innocent (which I am).
<comment>
Goodnight there de lids. I've stayed up too long, silly me.
<comment>
Is it really these days? I know girls tend to overreact with their emotions (like crying over someone they don't even know).

Abood and Video Game Warlord kicking the shit out of Ruthmong in his back garden. His neighbours looking over the fence and laughing
<comment>
Looks like someone was banned
<comment>
He may well be normie but I don't think he could love her as much as I would. She means the world to me. I've had dreams about her and woke up depressed when it wasn't reality.
<comment>
You know nothing about normal human emotions lad
<comment>
Banned for defending r ruth from ruthmong? Very peculiar, wonder what he did. Might have been spamming reports or something.
<comment>
Probably some split personality. See this lad is probably a nasty person and tries to convey me as someone bad to make himself feel better. His true colours have been shown.
<comment>
I dunno I feel like Abood has a lot of love in his heart
<comment>
What a coincidence. I feel the same way about Abood himself
<comment>
Looks like he announced a report. Nanny hates that kind of behaviour
<comment>
If anything this just proves that multiple people think you're not being very nice.
<comment>
That saddo tried to get to me laurel dreams but she wasn't having any of it. She continues to make her asmr. Though she did delete a bunch of videos.
<comment>
Add me to the list of people who think Ruthmong isn't being very nice. To say the least.

What did he mean by this
<comment>
Ruthmong, your rival Abood is a plastic surgeon https://dr-abood.co.uk/
Maybe he can fix your incel skull shape
<comment>
Do you think she would like having her face posted on 4chan dot org slash r9k, the notorious website full of angry incels?
<comment>
Abood would never
<comment>
I'm not that type of incel. Don't lump me with the fucked up ones.
<comment>
She is more affected by silly people leaving nasty comments. It ruins her day. Me posting funny pictures here is not a concern.

Are you really middle aged at 30 years old lads? I guess a lot of younger people see older people that way. Very depressing to think about desu.
https://vocaroo.com/1cPpsvBoKTo3
<comment>
These both sound fucking disgusting lmao is this what you're spending 16 hours a day obsessing over?
<comment>
Now imagine if I called a 30yo woman "middle aged" in a public space. I'd be arrested for hate crimes.
<comment>
Women that are in their 30s are more likely to be menopausal and have higher chances of producing an unhealthy child (autism).
<comment>
He's getting angry, he's getting riled up, he's going to start auditposting any minute now. He's stomping his webbed feet on the floor of his childhood bedroom in excitement
<comment>
I'm not obsessing for 16 hours a day. She has a nice whisper voice, though I don't really like her normal voice. I'm guessing when she learnt English, she picked up the American dialect.

Oh sir Abood,
What shall I do,
I'm feeling kind of sick of ruthmong posting blues
<comment>
Imagine if there's a mad gunman going around shooting people and several people are hiding somewhere in a building. He's already been around town shooting up multiple places. The government issues their emergency alert protocol to all phones within that area. Now everyone who is trapped will have their phones set off with a loud siren. He then finds them and unloads several rounds into them.
Great work government protecting your citizens. Shall be keeping it off personally. It will do more harm than good. It will be used for silly weather alerts.

He's been "unmasked" for ages. He only covers up just to troll others when they try to do cambacks. Can't believe normal people don't do their research. He thinks GDPR applies to him because his videos earn revenue. If this was the case, the the BBC would have to censor everyone's face out in a news video.

This video is from 2021. People keep acting like he's been unmasked have no fucking clue. He's a good man and you can tell he wants to stick up for our rights.

The eggs will be expiring, the attention from men will diminish. She will have a middle aged crisis. Maybe she will get a cat as she doesn't want children. Any woman who has children is selfish anyway. Biggest carbon emitters are women and their spawn.

Fuck it all.

Yea it's shit but the alternative is to have nothing to live because you have no money other than to keep yourself alive, no social interactions, no skills, no self-worth, every day is the same with nothing to look forward to, turning to alcohol, turning to drugs, turning to crime, jail, less money, less friends, even family abandons you, self-hatred, no escape from the vicious cycle.
Stay in work. Don't be me.

I only have 7k. But I live with parents who pay all the bills so realistically I will neet for at least a decade now I think. Life is fucking shit.

I need to ring the energywankers, nip to the supermarket, and contemplate planting some seeds, then I can get my doss on, as the Americans say.
I kept changing the alarm when it went off this morning. Went from 08:30 to 09:45.

<comment>
but i do. i do not understand why these kind of women start dating these rat looking foreigners when white lads like me would do fucking anything for them. i once saw one cutie white women with some fucking curry in town last summer holding hands and laughing and i just do not understand why.

No he doesn't. He just wishes white girls would love him.

Have a friend on my steam friends list that has 275 hours played past 2 weeks. He NEETs it up all day, lives at home and plays Black Desert 24/7. He's 31 years old.

This is all women's fault. Why pursue a life knowing you won't ever be desired? I don't blame the lad.
<comment>
ready to jump and won't come down.
Won't jumping make you go down?
<comment>
Except ruthmong probably can't operate a bicycle
<comment>
I blame his parents honestly. I went to school with him and I remember his parents were coddling him way too much. He was treated like a literal baby by them for far too long.
<comment>
True but no one should have to go that way. All I wanted was for a normie life and I can't get that. Fuck it.

The best thing a parent can do is throw their son out by 18 if he isn't in education or working.

Life can be shit at times, especially when other people are involved. 
I hope you don't an hero, but I've been close a few times, so know that feel.

Don't know why these auditors waste their breath responding back to these grumps. Just stay silent and watch the NPC struggle to keep their composure.
<comment>
I think I will sow some seeds today. I sowed some scotch bonnet chilli's the other month, but there was only 1 worth keeping.
Today I'll sow, swiss chard, onions and carrots, and some beetroot, as well as getting things sorted for the French beans.
<comment>
I don't know how you get away with posting pictures of yourself every day.
<comment>
Rare monday off and i'm spending it building gunpla and listening to music. Comfy
<comment>
or play beach volley
or met a new yorker writer yeah in the middle of nowhere aland
we had fun talking
cant believe it either
<comment>
What is the pla short for? Remember when everyone decided that cosplay was a word so that they didn't have to call their hobby "playing fancy dress". 
Why can't you just call your hobby building models? It's far less bad than playing fancy dress
<comment>
its because no one gives a fuck
<comment>
Scotch bonnet chili, seedling.
Small, but hopefully flourishes.
<comment>
that's a weed
<comment>
based and garden pilled
<comment>
Definitely not a Scotch Bonnet, and I'm almost certain that it's not a chilli varietal at all.
<comment>
Why would he lie to us like that?
<comment>
Kek these things grow through the cracks in my pavement. Nigga has no idea. 
If you're trying to germinate you'll need the soil to be wetter than that.
<comment>
how do you manage to grow chillies through the pavement?
<comment>
Superior skill and forbidden knowledge. Next question PLEASE

i think he's back at work this week
<comment>
Elon isn't my favourite celebrity. I wouldn't even call him a 'celebrity' anyway. He's an entrepreneur, engineer, visionary
<comment>
Can you ask AI to make SSM in the image of a penis, where his next is the shaft, and his head the glans?
<comment>
Immigration should not only be reduced to zero, but emigration should be encouraged too, heavily in fact.

He's a spoilt rich boy that hasn't actually done anything himself, other than own the libs, since PayPal.

No one is saying this, only that it's gay to be arguing about it on either sides. You are a dum dum

ruthmong do you drink, if so then how much?

This, twitter is and always has been a shithole full of bedwetters, it's shocking that anyone here gives a shit

You're two are seething at how based twitter is since Elon took over kek

is he a tyrant who needs auditing? get ruthmong on the case.
<comment>
maybe he should start desu
<comment>
No I'm not, he had the fortune to be born rich and instead of helping out a single person he just jerks himself off and tells everyone how clever he is. 
He's not going to let you blow him even if he is your favourite celebrity.
<comment>
I can tell you're poor.
<comment>
Gun - gundam
Pla - plastic models
call your hobby building models
Because gunpla, military models, wargaming minis etc all have different scales/techniques/aesthetics/materials etc to them, i say gunpla because i'm being specific, although yes i am building models
<comment>
Well I'm not, I make decent money. You're just a bit too dim to realise that idolising him is no different to the Stacie's worshipping whichever reality star is flavour of the week.
<comment>
Sat here at 2pm on a Monday. Interesting all the well off lads posting here whenever there's an argument hey.
<comment>
I'm on my lunch while WFH. What's your excuse?
<comment>
Donovan cover for the lads. https://voca.ro/15hBtEXOQOt9

WFH
I'm wanking too
<comment>
We all Wank from Home in life x
<comment>
Cheers lad, didn't mean to come off like a bellend. I think models are neat. Cosplay is for autists and whores.
<comment>
Look I may be a drug addict but at least I haven't turned wanking into a hobby.
<comment>
Fancy keyboard you've got there, mind if I give it a try...?
<comment>
There we go. Work from home LARP again.
<comment>
Is it even worth pointing out that you are also here at 2pm on a Monday accusing other lads of being poor
Lovely this lad, cheers
<comment>
went to the local park and did some chin-ups, first time in a long time. I've been meaning to do it for ages now but I always chicken out, or there's chavs there
will probably have to get up around 6-7 AM in the future though if I want to be unseen 
only managed 3x5, bar is thicker than the ones you can use on a doorframe, lats and biceps are fuckin blasted
anyone here tried TRT? I wanna get on it since I think my test is low, guessing I'd just need a blood test
<comment>
Which is worse? Taking drugs or masturbating?
<comment>
Definitely masturbating, 1000%
<comment>
Amazing the hoops neets unskilled workers will jump through to project their own insecurities onto others.
<comment>
I'm WFH of course, on my lunch break at 2.30.
<comment>
depends on the drug innit
<comment>
You're a weed.
I try
Ok alan titmush.
It germinated, that is when the seed sprouts. Are you sure you know what you're talking about?, mr a shitposter.
<comment>
what is it with chavs and parks? i saw some last time i went in the middle of the day too.
<comment>
My pleasure friendo

Is it weird that I prefer watching my gf masturbate over actually shagging her? I find her attractive and sexy but prefer to enjoy her passively. Anyone else like this?
<comment>
Weeds are more resilient than chilli plants, which that decidedly is not
<comment>
Porned and deathgrippilled
<comment>
Sorry lad but I'm not good enough to sing this Donovan, well beyond my capabilities
<comment>
which that decidedly is not
Weird how there was 6 seeds, of which 3 germinated and looked the same, but that's weeds for you, I guess.
It was a joke, I didn't expect you to take it seriously.
<comment>
Absolutely amazing how many people stop to give chuggers in London the time of day to let them waffle off their shite

You seem touchy friend. Don't come crying to me when you have to try to eat leaves. But don't take my word for it, I don't really mind, but you won't be allowed to join our secret r9k gardening club with that attitude.
<comment>
I'm a gardencel, I couldn't join the club.
<comment>
Aye lad I know, I was making a joke back
<comment>
chugger
first time hearing that. where does the term even come from?
<comment>
True, mostly women. I usually just walk fast with headphones and I look like someone who is skint anyway so they don't bother with me
I don't even really know, I always thought it was odd myself
<comment>
Just had a look and it's a mix of charity and mugger. Obvious in hindsight ha

Ah, you got me. D'oh.

He's trying to hurt our feelings with TikTok screenshots!
<comment>
I forgot to say sorry. I'm clueless, so will germinate a couple more seeds and see what happens. I'll keep that 1, then when it turns out to be what you've said, I'll post it.
<comment>
when americans say school instead of firing range
<comment>
and instead of helping out a single person
shit tier lowest common denominator thinking. Why should anyone be reasonably well off when there's always a poorer person to give that wealth too?
It's not like he just blows all his money on personal luxurious, quite the opposite. All his money goes to the greater good of humanity.

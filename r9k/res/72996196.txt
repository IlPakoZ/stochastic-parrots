zoomers will never understand how much this song was a cultural touchstone. daft punk was the soundtrack to our high school experience and then just vanished into thin air for 8 years
then when we are in our early 20s just discorvering nightlife, getting our first real jobs, moving out of home, discovering our sexualities and casual sex and they come out with this track, destroyed the fucking world, every bar on the planet was blasting it, perfectly timed for all the nostalgia of high school plus the immense charge of our sexual peaks
this song is peak millenial

If you where in HS when this song came out then you're literally a zoomer.

no man i was talking about the earlier body of daft punk work, 2001-2007 were their peak years, you don't even know about it, they were the soundtrack of our generation
then as i said they just vanished off the face of the earth and came back with this track 8 years later when we were all in our early 20s

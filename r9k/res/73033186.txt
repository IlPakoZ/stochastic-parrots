the parents attim hortons have master degrees
Why? They're the only ones I know not dropping out of working shit min wage jobs living 2-5 a room. Everyone else is living on welfare, going back to school indefinitely, or moving. 
I don't work for less than 20 an hour no matter what job it is. I would rather be unemployed than work min wage. Its a huge waste of time and effort. How can some people be ok with living like that?

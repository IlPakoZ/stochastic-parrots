10th grade, living in a singlewide trailer with my siblings and chainsmoking grandmother, suffering from severe acne, only owning a few articles of clothing, being a loser in highschool that ate lunch in the bathroom.
That said it was still probably the best time in my life just because I had no responsibilities and got to play halo 2 on xbox live when I got home.

whst happened?
<comment>
be 15-16
in 10th-11th grade
didn't have a computer or cellphone
used internet at public libraries
often what I would do all day on weekends
and after school also
could reserve time slots in the computer room using an automated phone-in registration 
limited to 2 one hour sessions per day
used each of my parents' library cards to get 6 hours computer time
automatically logged out after each hour and have to sign in again
scramble to write down on paper or email myself anything I want to save
never heard of 4chan, or memes
spent a lot of time on livejournal and myspace
met people on teenchat.com and studentcenter.org
yahoo music, yahoo mail and AIM express
went in the Apple store to take pictures for my myspace page, browse myspace, LJ and use chatrooms 
got kicked out at multiple mall Apple stores for doing this
no car or license (still don't in my 30s)
walked, took public bus, and rode my Razor scooter to the library and everywhere
had many tapes of music I recorded off the radio
and many burned CDs people at school gave me
didn't have my own TV, no cable or satellite
mainly just listened to the radio and whatever recordings I had
I liked listening to Green Day, Muse, StainD, Avenged Sevenfold, Fallout Boy, Switchfoot, No Doubt, Paramore, Evanescence, Liz Phair and... Rascal Flatts
<comment>
I was playing brick breaker on my home computer
rather go back to that than get yelled at by a spastic retard that I have to wheel around
aka my dad
he used to not be insufferable 
but he is taking his frustration out on me
4 siblings all have fucked off because I was an accident that happened 20 years after them
now I'm stuck with two sick retard boomers 
didn't always hate them
it happened gradually
I wish I was fucking Natalie right now

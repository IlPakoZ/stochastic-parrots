im permabanned tripfag niggerstomper58. i first started reading r9k when i was about 12. by 14 i got really obsessed with the concept of "being a robot" and tried to channel it constantly, until my thought process got really bizarre and i would repeat things like "nigger balls" and "i love shitting inside nigger assholes" in my head for hours, and i would get really paranoid, start seeing things in the corners of my eyes etc, basically prodromal schizophrenia. im now on antipsychotics. i always wondered what the kind of "robot" style of r9k humor was all about; i think it's the unconscious leaking in to the conscious, what jungian theory considered to be the cause of schizophrenic and schizotypal syptoms. i would advise all people who "get" r9k to be careful because that likely means you have a predisposition to a mental illness. peace.
What if you can do this without going crazy?
mental illness? *yawn* what's that?

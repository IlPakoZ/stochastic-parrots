Being unloved as a child or feeling unwanted by parents is more common of an experience than you might think. And it can have long-lasting effects on those who go through it. Some include having:
an insecure attachment style
low emotional intelligence
trust issues
poor boundaries
toxic relationships
feelings of isolation
mental health conditions
Whether you felt unloved by your parents or you experienced emotional neglect as a child, try to remember that you can heal at any time. Some strategies for healing the effects of an unloving childhood include:
participating in individual or group therapy
practicing self-care
reading self-help books
understanding your triggers
healing and validating your inner child
I'd like to add substance abuse as another result of this too. Thank you anon, this will help some robots heal what they may not even know is there

Im mortally afraid of love and try so hard to avoid it bc im afraid itll end my life and take away my freedom but whenever i let myself fall in love It always comes as a relief
incels and khhvs are like vampires who got the gift of eternal life but realized eternal life is a fucking drag, and constantly dream of finally getting laid (lol) to rest
god killed their child out of mercy to spare it's 18 years of existence being raised by them
I think avoiding love is destroying my mind and yet I won't give in and ghost the woman I love.
Feels like nature is forcing me to be with her and I want to stay in control.
The trick is to get a woman to fall in love with you, while you love her, but don't allow your self to fall on love. Once you get that giddy, gleeful feeling, you start simping and it's over. If you can maintain frame, love is a wonderful thing.
Polyandry honestly isn't a bad idea. Say if shes guaranteed to give you two children and its cheap since youre sharing the cost with other men. I think this could be a viable option for incels so long as the rest of the world doesn't have more than a couple of kids themselves.

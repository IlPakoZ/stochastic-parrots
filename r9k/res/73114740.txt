I avoid women because I refuse to simp
I avoid people because they are all simps
Anyone else relate?
Or is /r9k/ too full of normalfags and trannies to relate to real robothood anymore?
I avoid everyone because I don't really enjoy socializing or relating to other people at all, I don't have a better reason than that.
Nah Ive kinda grown the same way but partly just cause not only are my friends simps but completely blue pilled. One told me he planned on marrying this girl with another mans kid, one of them is just hopelessly blue pilled but single, one wont have kids with his gf for le environment. And any of them are total cucks and whipped in any relationship its annoying. Women are hot and some are nice and pretty cool but we are not supposed to relate to eachother or be friends, thats what we have members of our fellow sex for. Its pretty clear why nature forces us together and nature doesnt waste time on goodly feelings
I avoid women because they're barely human and the only thing they have ever brought to the world that's good is their reproduction organs. I hate people because they're all retards. They play the game that's clearly rigged against 99% of them. They refuse to open their eyes to how shit really is and then when you force them open, they go into full denial mode regardless.
Normies will NEVER take the redpill

Is it possible to become asexual, or is it just a meme? I have a severe weakness to /fit/ girls, but it's not like I'll ever get a gf anyways, so what's the point?
Please keep the shitposts to a bare minimum, for this is serious.

SSRI'S will shit on your sex drive

Had a girl tell me that she was asexual but she wanted a romantic relationship.
That's like saying you're not hungry but you want the biggest hamburger available.

Unironically castrate yourself. You'll lose your sex drive.

It's like saying she wants a hamburger, but without the cow. Bun, lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce... and a black bean patty instead of a beef patty. It's still recognizable as a hamburger, just not one that's appealing to most people. But it's appealing to some people. Same as a romantic relationship where you share intimacy and love without sticking a penis in a vagina.

I don't take the jewish pills, but I get what you're saying.
I don't care about sex that much, but I do crave human contact. I need to get rid of that.
Not a fan, but thanks for the suggestion.
Is that really the case? I get what you're saying, but does a relationship revolves around sex? Are we really that simple?
I never heard about that before. Are you in that situation? I hope not.

You can have a relationship without sex just like you can have a hamburger without a beef patty. You are not obligated to include the beef or the sex, but most people CHOOSE to include them because that's how most people PREFER them. It's a choice and a preference.
You could also eat a beef patty on its own, without the bun/lettuce/tomato/onion/sauce... just like how you can have sex on its own, without a relationship, by visiting a prostitute. You choose not to do these things because that's not how you prefer them.
Don't worry about it, we're not so simple after all.

Genuine asexuality will usually happen early and you'll just be sexually disinterested. Some people can become disinterested in sex from trauma or anxiety or a schizoid personality or hormones, but these don't have the same lasting power of genuine asexuality. If you just want a fit mommy and can't live without, your only option is to get fit and healthy and be some kind of gym/marathon bro, and it's honestly not that hard to do, just be less of a useless nigger.

did you guys know that in the life of the majority of man the only time he gets flowers is at his own funeral
I didn't know you guys wanted flowers. What flowers do men like?
blue roses
Did you know OP is a faggot? And one who will only ever make empty threats on 4chan by the sounds of it
eat a donut you faggot federal pig
did you guys know that most men who commit suicide #1 reason attributed is to loneliness? and they say you can be happy alone
Okay thank you very much for letting me know.
Fuck you glownigger. Go suck off your handler like a good boy
retard the glowniggers are the federal agents
ALONE, alone would be very difficult. With a loving pet though, I'm good.
pets do help but people genuinely think you can be completely alone and be happy for the rest of your life. normies had mental breakdowns during quarantine and started offing themselves because they had to live like a robot for one month
Miss me with this gay shit nigga
I'd be somewhat adverse to getting a gift that last 3-4 days max. 
I think those only work with women since they usually already getting everything else anyway. So something that perishable is just a last resort that isnt really troubling for them.
And besides, who of us owns a fucking vase?
My prom date gave me a single flower to put on my suit about 8-9 years ago, does that count. It was basically just the head.

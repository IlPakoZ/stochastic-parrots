ALONE, alone would be very difficult. With a loving pet though, I'm good.

pets do help but people genuinely think you can be completely alone and be happy for the rest of your life. normies had mental breakdowns during quarantine and started offing themselves because they had to live like a robot for one month

I'd be somewhat adverse to getting a gift that last 3-4 days max. 
I think those only work with women since they usually already getting everything else anyway. So something that perishable is just a last resort that isnt really troubling for them.
And besides, who of us owns a fucking vase?

My prom date gave me a single flower to put on my suit about 8-9 years ago, does that count. It was basically just the head.

Their whole schtick is fundamentally disrespectful to everyone who isn't them. They're narcissistic. They shove their sexuality in your face. They use 'sassy' expressions like 'Yas Queen.' The whole thing has this vague undertone of "fuck you lol."
They're a small percentage of the population, and only the loud and obnoxious ones get noticed and recognized. You don't notice the ones who are like regular people, because they blend in with straight people and don't stick out.
You just say that because they don't wanna fuck you in particular.
Half the compliments I've received in the past 5 years were from gay men. I don't have a problem with them.
You sound like the sort of person who thinks gay couples holding hands in public are shoving it in your face, but then you turn a blind eye to straight people's literally advertising their marriages on newspapers
Just a question but if homosexuality is okay, then what's the argument against incest? As far as I know, as long as the consenting parties have protection on to avoid the possibility of tard babies, arguments in favor of gay like
can be used for incest too.
If all the criteria mentioned above are satisfied, then you could say theoretically that the ban on incest is purely dogmatic and cultural, and incest itself isn't hurtful. It's a morally grey dilemma that no one is willing to address, at least not for now. 
That does not remove the legitimacy of gay love and gay loving families. 
If incest couples wanna fight for their freedom, let them do it. Let the happy incest couples come to the light 
In reality, more often than not, incest couples are deeply intertwined with abuse and other sinister stories of exploitation, rather than just loving doves shackled by faith. I'll let them prove me wrong if that's the truth
Then there's nothing wrong with it, t b h.

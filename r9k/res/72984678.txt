.wav used to be thing. I remember it maybe my car radio player couldnt read mp3.

Now all cars can play wav, mp3, and aac. I just stick with mp3 though as it's so widespread that I never have to worry about compatibility. FLAC for home playing of course.

3gp. I've got one file of it. It's 20 years and 17 days old. Was used as a further compression of videos so that phones could better upload and download media

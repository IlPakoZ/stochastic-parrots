 I has a friend
 he has psychosis
 believes that he is a "panzer angel" literary
 preaches on facebook about random
 gets 4000 new subscribers or friends on facebook overnight due to his god-lectures
 scammers realize he has psychosis
 creates accounts with cute girls
 he calls me and says he has become a father
 turns out this fake woman has a fake child and the scammer has tricked him into believing they are now family
 i tell him that this is such a fucking obvious scam, now even a downie wound fall for it
 he does not believe me, and says God blaha blaha retarded christian bullshit bleh blah 
 i tell him they will ask for money anytime now, its so fucking obvious
 he says no
 one day later he has send $1000 to the scammer
 i try to talk with him, he screams at me and calls me jealous et.c.
 its now two weeks later and he has begun borrowing money from the bank. i think he has probably given away about $20 000 or maybe more
He will never be able to pay off his loans
I really do not want to be the friend that have to clean this shit up. I am thinking I NEED to ghost him before he comes banging on my door as a forever-debt hobo.
It is maybe better if he just ends up locked up in a psych.
Picture is the woman he is in love with, and "his child"

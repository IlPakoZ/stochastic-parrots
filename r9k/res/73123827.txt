Does dating get easier in your 30s?
<comment>
Men hit their prime in their 50's
Trust the plan
Once the last hair falls from your head all the girls will be orgasming from just being in your presance.
<comment>
for men, dating stays about the same difficulty. for women, dating gets more difficult.
<comment>
Well you kind of get a reputation at that point. They either expect you're seeing another girl, or they talk shit about how your not marriage material. Dry spells are cured by traveling. Infamy only lasts one or two states depends how many borders there are, maybe 5.
<comment>
men age like milk left in the sun lmao
<comment>
There's nothing that gives woman the "ick" more than seeing "30+" on a dating app.
<comment>
i am extremely pessimistic about the future and lack excitement and happiness due to other evils beyond my control
<comment>
Not really, more women will like you but they are all are fat single mothers. Dating really peaks for men from 17-22. This is when you have the chance to bag an easy diamond in the rough wall flower. After that its all left overs.
<comment>
I dunno. Got laid a couple times before 20, did the incels thing thru most of my 20s and 30s. Met my wife at 37 after I had long since given up. So there is hope anon.
<comment>
 Met my wife at 37

What do you mean? Most people have kids already in their 30s.
<comment>
Of course it does, unless you're a basement dwelling NEET.
<comment>
what happens if i am a basement dweller
<comment>
It gets more degenerate, not in a good way.
Let's face it: all the actual wife tier girls are gone in their 30's, they're already married. No matter what you think 'wife tier' actually is, by that time she'll have someone already.
so what's left?
single moms
drug addicts
insane women
ugly women or horrible personalities
Sometimes you get the occasional divorced girl who is actually good, but... are you really gonna settle for someone that used up? That's an enormous self cuck
Personally I'd just keep talking to 18 year olds until you find one with massive daddy issues and lock her down
<comment>
A man in his 30s can easily get girls in their 20s.
<comment>
Yeah I fucking hate kids. Not gonna help all you tradlarpers unfortunately.
<comment>
girls in their 20s.
at the peak of their hoe phase as they see the wall coming
minimum age of consent or I don't care
<comment>
The women get older and uglier while also paradoxically developing higher standards and becoming more full of themselves. Also people call you a pedo if you go for actual attractive girls in the range of 15-19
<comment>
Yeah, so who's the belly dancing broad?
<comment>
if your main issue is being a pussy then yes as the women get more aggressive. if your main issue is anything else then no.

As a 30 year old man with limited experience, there are plusses and minuses.
Depending on how young you're willing to date, you have a larger dating pool to pick from. But the reality is I think most women in their early 20's don't want to date a man in their 30's, and as you get older, those women become less desirable anyway (from a kind of compatibility viewpoint anyway, of course they're still attractive).
I find it's harder to find women my own age. The sad fact is, if you're still alone at 30, then there's probably a reason why. There are a lot of fatties and single mothers around my age on dating apps. 
Then there are women who have just gotten out of long-term relationships, who are afraid of wasting their time again and will only settle for someone "perfect". I'm in a bit of a tough situation because, for various reasons, I haven't been in a long-term relationship. When I've told women this in recent years, you can practically see the red lights flashing before their eyes. They REALLY don't like that.
Another issue when dating in your 30's is, having kids is a priority for a lot of women and if you're unsure then they'll GTFO immediately. If they want kids, they gotta have them soon.
On the plus side, you do get the chance to date more mature women who have grown past a lot of the bullshit that young women get away with. When you meet one of them, it can feel like you're actually interacting with a real person, rather than someone trying to play some sort of game.
In summary, it depends on your personal situation. 
Looking back, even though I have hit more of my "prime" now, I don't have a lot of the opportunities I had back in the day. Meeting people at school or at new job is a game-changer. I don't have that as an adult in a settled down career. A lot of women don't do dating apps at all.
<comment>
Those are pretty much the two big problems
your level of romantic experience not matching your age
meeting new women
Some options include fame, music or owning a business where you hire new people but then you always have to be paranoid about girls trying to play you
<comment>
Men hit their prime in their 50's
Trust the plan
made me lol
<comment>
The issue of romantic experience is definitely a big problem. At least, it is for women. I'm more domesticated than many married men I know, and have had plenty of great sexual and romantic encounters. My short-term relationships and dates just didn't work out. In fact, I've been madly infatuated with several women, only to break it off because I could see issues that would become a problem in the long-term. 
It's funny to me that a woman will see my lack of experience as a red-flag. I've been highly selective in deciding with whom to start a serious, committed relationship, while they have proven through experience they couldn't do that. Surely, all things equal, someone with a track-record of failure should be a bigger red flag than someone that doesn't? I can understand the suspicion though. 
Your suggested options are silly by the way. Meeting women at live music shows is a decent idea though, but unfortunately not usually my kind of thing.
<comment>
having kids is a priority for a lot of women and if you're unsure then they'll GTFO immediately. If they want kids, they gotta have them soon.
so basically they've been ran through by chad and tyrone and every single playboy and drug dealer they knew, and they're looking for some pathetic careermax'd cuckold to marry and raise their telegomy'd children?
while at the same time being unable to pairbond and haven given away their best years of love and sex to someone else, while laughing at you?
men consider this to be desireable?
On the plus side, you do get the chance to date more mature women who have grown past a lot of the bullshit that young women get away with. When you meet one of them, it can feel like you're actually interacting with a real person, rather than someone trying to play some sort of game.
you mean someone so old and decrepit and wrinkly, and who's roastie pussy smells so rancid that no chad is willing to get into a relathionship with them, so they have to pretend they have a likeable personality and act nice around men they dont find attractive?
how can you seriously fall in love with, and love on a girl who you know had men who were bigger than you, more handsome, more alpha, and had loving experiences with those men?
how can you seriously love a girl who blew 6 guys in one night and never told a soul?
<comment>
i am 40
i recently met this girl on tinder, she is 25
sex with her is amazing, her ass is so fine, she likes being choked, throatfucked, and she cuddled with me and kissed me all night.
i've seen her two times, we spent time togheter before and after sex. She is funny and smart. But here is the catch: i can recognize very typical struggles of a 25 year old human being, even if she claim to be more mature than her age. She lives day by day, with a part time job, studying at university, sometimes unable to schedule daytimes. I can recognize the same behaviour of mine in my 20s .
it's been a week since we last met. Right now i'm so conflicted because i wanna spend time with her but i guess the more i see her, the higher the feeling of wasting time with her will be. I feel like i am trying to escape from the reality of my age, and i should find an older girl.
<comment>
and have had plenty of great sexual and romantic encounters
so you're a chad who ran through girls, had their best years, and now is looking to settle down with some high quality girl?
imagine some guy who got with the girls you fucked
imagine him seeing pictures of his wife with you when you were younger, and those girls have fond sexual memories of him
just lol. this is what men have to deal with if they arent chad
die alone or be a cuck who gets used up whores who are incapable of pairbonding
<comment>
Agreed, I've also been selective with women which contributed to my lack of "experience" but I simply don't want to stick my dick into trouble. I'm also the kind of guy who won't have sex with someone unless I actually like them. It's a good way to think of those as positives.
I don't understand why my options are silly though, I simply meant to say that men who have a steady influx of new partners or meet new women usually do so through fame, art or they run one of those startups with high turnover. I've seen all of those irl. In "normal" careers you just don't have that level of social exposure.
<comment>
Dating got way better for me in my 30s. There were personal and social factors.
Personal:
finished phd 
got good job
moved to place with lots of high quality single women
aged extremely well
got in better shape
learned how to groom and dress better
got better at going on dates/being charming
travel a ton for work, easy to play the role of interesting visitor
Social:
most women like older guys
most guys do not agree well 
This all combined to make it trivially easy for me to get whatever I want, basically on demand. Any age, any background, any race, any dating goal (from hookup to marriage). I never have to think about dating a single mom, or a fat girl, or a poly freak. Just wholesome hot educated women 5+ years younger.
<comment>
You sound like you have some kind of repressed cuckold fantasy or deep insecurity.
I have no idea what point you're trying to make in your first paragraph. Telegony, what? Also I'm not interested in single mothers so I don't waste any thought about their circumstances.
you mean someone so old and decrepit and wrinkly, and who's roastie pussy smells so rancid that no chad is willing to get into a relathionship with them, so they have to pretend they have a likeable personality and act nice around men they dont find attractive?
That's not how sexual organs work lol
Anyway, apparently I am a chad according to >>73124690 since I've had pleasant sexual/romantic encounters before.
What I mean is, as women (and people) mature, they can become more worldly, open-minded, and original. It's a much nicer experience chatting to those people because they're able to think critically and aren't desperate to fulfil some socially inherited purpose or an immature longing for intimacy.
how can you seriously fall in love with, and love on a girl who you know had men who were bigger than you
My dick is pretty big so I don't worry about that. That's also not how vaginas work.
how can you seriously love a girl who blew 6 guys in one night and never told a soul?
This has probably happened to much fewer women than you think.
You don't need to be a chad to have had sex before. This problem of your partner having a sexual history applies to everyone who isn't a virgin. It's only a problem for incels.
Oh I'm sure those people do have more luck in meeting women. It just sounded like you were suggesting that a man in his 30's should simply become famous or start a successful business.
<comment>
lots of high quality single women
depends what you mean with high quality. Virgins?
hot educated women
LMAO
<comment>
must be nice being a chad with the whole world as your oyster, having unlimited sex and dating options, and having no care in the world. you must laugh at the pathetic desperate cucks who eventually wife up the whores you use as cumrags
god is cruel to the weak
<comment>
You sound like you have some kind of repressed cuckold fantasy or deep insecurity.
okay. to be honest, usually people tell me that or tell me im autistic. i am autistic, but im not a cuckold
Telegony, what?
dna of previous partners stays inside their body forever, changes their dna, and the dna of future offspring. she is pozzed for life with your dna, pic related
My dick is pretty big so I don't worry about that
ah, so your big dick chad who blew girls out and enjoy smugly chucking at the future cuckold who wifes up your disposeable cumrags and has to deal with the fact that they cant compete?
you also dodged question entirely. females are not capable of pairbonding once they're used up
isnt it great that this is what most men, especially incels have to look forward to? marrying chad's blown out used up cumrag because they're so desperate and lonely, and its their only chance to get a girl?
This has probably happened to much fewer women than you think
doesnt matter if its 6 in a row or 6 at different times. a blow dick is a blown dick, and girls have lots of sex\
This problem of your partner having a sexual history applies to everyone who isn't a virgin. It's only a problem for incels.
COPE. many chads and normies all seek virginal girls as wives, because used up whores are not capable of pairbonding and are ruined by chad. the best gets the most desireable girls, and virgin girls are the most desireable, because they're the ones capable of pairbonding with you and dont have miles of someone else's cock in them
<comment>
Careful what you wish for. You might never fuck a 20 year old again
<comment>
I don't want to date a single mother so that image has no significance to me.
ah, so your big dick chad who blew girls out and enjoy smugly chucking at the future cuckold who wifes up your disposeable cumrags and has to deal with the fact that they cant compete?
No, I'm just not insecure about my partner being unsatisfied with my dick size. I've slept with girls who, believe it or not, were uncomfortable with the size of my dick. In this case, I'm actually at a disadvantage in your twisted "sex is a competition" scenario.
females are not capable of pairbonding once they're used up
False

Sleeping with a virgin was something I wanted when I was a virgin, so I can imagine how incels are obsessed with this. The first girl I slept with at 18 actually was a virgin but it was quite an uncomfortable experience. It can be very painful for some girls to break their hymen, and doing so can result in a lot of blood. As a result, I would not like to have sex with a virgin again. After that uncomfortable experience though, the sex was pretty good.
<comment>
NTA, but I strongly disagree with your statement about a person's sexual history being largely irrelevant to people. a high number for both sexes is usually an indicator of someone you don't want a longterm relationship with. im not saying you need to be a virgin, that is ridiculous.
<comment>
Depends on what you mean by easier. Women have a huge advantage in dating in their teens and 20s because women's attractiveness comes largely from their looks, which peak in their youth. This advantage decreases as women get older, so dating gets harder for them over time. Men's attractiveness is determined by genes(height, face, hair) and accomplishments(money, career, fame, social skills, fitness), the former being mostly unaffected by aging and the latter actually generally increasing over time. This results in men's desirability peaking later than women's. There is also another factor in play in that there are more boys than girls being born, resulting in an excess of boys in the younger age groups that creates additional demand for women. At the same time boys also die at a faster rate, so that excess will decrease and eventually balance out, thus gradually removing that advantage from women.
Looking at all of this, it would seem like things will get easier for men as they age. HOWEVER, the problem is that this is caused by a reduction in the quality of women. You'll probably be getting more attention, but it will be from women you don't find attractive or who have other undesirable traits like being single mothers. Is it easier to find a woman in your 30s? Yes. Is it easier to find a good woman in your 30s? No.
<comment>
No one likes the idea of their partner having had sex with other people. But if you've had sex yourself, you have to accept it. Otherwise, you're a hypocrite. So most people would rather not know the answer, whether it's 100 sexual partners or 1, and so don't ask. In that way, it is irrelevant.
Now, if for whatever reason you do know that a person has massive sexual history, it can be a turn off, sure.
<comment>
No, but you sort of just go with the flow. Either you stick with the same girl, settle for the most readily available girl in your life, or, in rare cases, give up on the dating market entirely.
<comment>
Does dating get easier in your 30s?
Depends if you've grinded out a decent/good career and self improved in other ways, also if your standards have dropped. The average 35 y/o guys has declined in about every attractive trait except for status/career/money. If you are constantly grinding self improvement, it's easier to be more attractive at 35 than 25, especially if your looks don't dramatically decline, and especially if you weren't doing really well at 25 like most anons don't. The red pill copers are wrong that men peak when they are old, this isn't broadly true, but can be true for people who didn't have a high lookspeak in their 20s, or who improved their status a lot in their later years with a good career. 
I guess what I'm getting at is, it depends. Are you a better person and dating option than you were in your 20s? Are you willing to date girls 25+ who are less shallow and/or have different priorities to younger women who mainly care about casual sex and looks?

A H E M, excuse me, IDIOTS *ting ting ting*
YOUR ATTENTION P L E A S E
i have a question to ask of thee. who's the BITCH in the OP webm?
<comment>
But if you've had sex yourself, you have to accept it
no you dont you fucking retard. theres no gun to your neck saying you have to accept it. many chads and successful normies with plenty of experience still chase and get with virgins for long term relationships and marriage
if you are chad, you can have your cake and eat it too. you can run through girls, ruin them for life, and just pick a inexperienced virgin when you aer lonely. i posted a pic showing that used up whores are incapable of bairbonding, and the marriage quality of ran through whores is shit tier, its just desperate cucks who tolerate absolute shit behavior because they cant get any better >>73124690
 Otherwise, you're a hypocrite
you're already a hypocrite by running through girls and ruining them for other men. you wouldnt be okay if you were some averaged dick incel who got with a used up ran through whore who had massive dicks. learn to take the L and accept your moral failures. not like you even care about that shit anyways
<comment>
Now, if for whatever reason you do know that a person has massive sexual history, it can be a turn off, sure.
i may read be reading too much into this, but it seems you almost say this begrudgingly. the men i knew with highbodycounts treated women (more times than not) poorly. the women (like the men) were most likely to cheat and were using it to cope with some bs in their life (didn't see this as much with dudes). whether it was something related for their self esteem or whatever. the need for validation or just the pleasure/excitement from sex with someone new was a band-aid. was this the case for every single one, of course not. im not saying these are the same so please don't take it that way. if a person could choose to be with someone who was never an alcoholic vs a former one, most times they choose the former.
<comment>
hate kids
Based and same (36 anon here).
I'm planning on either finding an infertile woman or a tranny to settle down with once I get titanium dental implants put in.
Was always careful about using the condoms with the added spermicide in to make sure I didn't get anyone pregnant, except for when I was seeing this much older lady who was definitely not fertile anymore and didn't use condoms at all with her.
<comment>
are you suggesting i have to carry on this lustful nad questionable relationship as long as i can?
<comment>
Most normal people don't care about finding a virgin to settle down with because they don't believe retarded theories about pair bonding, vagina stretching, and aren't insecure about their sexual value.
I don't want a virgin, I don't want a chick who's fucked 100 guys either. Ideal is someone with a similar sexual history to myself. Just because I don't like to know the details of past sexual interactions, doesn't mean I'm not okay with it.
I'm not even a chad. Just a "normie" who has had sex with multiple people.
You're the one who's morally depraved. Thinking women to be "ruined" because they don't want to shack up with the first person they immaturely fall for.
I phrased it like that because most women don't have a massive sexual history so it's not really an issue. What is a high lifetime bodycount? What is the average lifetime bodycount?
<comment>
Are you trying to say that's a downside? Lol. Lmao
<comment>
So most people would rather not know the answer, whether it's 100 sexual partners or 1, and so don't ask. In that way, it is irrelevant.
If something is irrelevant then it doesn't affect anything. If it's something you deliberately try to ignore because you think it could ruin things, then it's clearly not irrelevant. There are people who engage in a similar kind of self-delusion when it comes to things like illnesses. They feel a lump in their chest and then just ignore it instead of going to the doctor to get it looked at, because they're afraid of the implications of a cancer diagnosis. To them, remaining ignorant is preferable to learning an uncomfortable truth, but that does not actually make the truth go away. The lump is very much relevant and can send them to an early grave, especially if they ignore it.
<comment>
depends on the country, in america i believe over ten is significant enough to be considered high: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/key_statistics/n-keystat.htm
data out there probably defines exacltly what high is, but to me doubling or tripling the average seems reasonable.
<comment>
Does dating get easier in your 30s?
No.
At least, not necessarily. Dating gets easier once you accept older women. For most men that is when they reach their 30s, but if you do it when you're younger you'll be drowning in older women
<comment>
feeling a lump in your chest would be irrelevant if you're about to die in a plane crash. And trying to find a virgin as an adult, who also happens to be incompatible with you is like trying to find the cure to cancer while the plane is spiralling.
There's nothing you can do about your partner having a average sexual history and worrying about it won't change anything or help anything.
For most people, it's a silly jealous thought that they shrug off after making the 1IQ realisation that being bothered by it would make them an idiotic hypocrite.
For incels, it's a problem because they can't shrug it off. So what are you going to do? Look for the cure to cancer on spiralling plane and spend the rest of your life alone?
<comment>
This Anon is exactly what happens when you get your shit together. Well done Anon.
<comment>
I'm 32 and thought it was going to be amazing fucking an 19 year old and ok sex was great but good lord was she a fucking idiot. No job, no school basically a neet and trying to have a normal conversation was a fucking struggle because she couldn't keep one going. After meeting up twice I told her I wanted no more of it when she wanted to meet up for a third time and then ghosted. It really is amazing how immature people that young are and they all think they're not. I need a women in the 27-30 range that has their shit together
<comment>
10 sexual partners across an entire lifetime seems like quite a low number, even if they reach that in their 20's/30's. I don't think many people would consider that a "massive sexual history".
<comment>
well, there is the data from the government and i think im being fair by pulling from a source fairly reputable. if it's a low number to you, you are probably around those who are on the more promiscuous side (which is whatever, you seem to be enjoying your life so i don't see why you should stop). if you think me saying double to triple is unreasonable for high, please let me know. i honestly think that's a fair way to define it.
massive sexual history"
never said it was a massive sexual history, just a high body count. maybe it's because of this place people interpret this as someone who fucked an entire classroom or something.
<comment>
*unreasonable for defining high, please let me know how? i honestly think that's a fair way to asses what high would be.
<comment>
I've kind of just accepted I'm retarded and these things don't apply to me anymore, life is weird.
<comment>
tfw almost 30 and recent ex-long term NEET
have to make up for all that lost time with current low status
want a 18 year old wife so I can pump out 12+ children
<comment>
The idea behind the lump comparison was to point out that avoiding the truth doesn't make the truth irrelevant and how it can lead to negative outcomes. In fact it could even literally lead to death since a high partner count is associated with a significantly higher risk of divorce and suicide rates for divorced men is about 10 times higher than the male average. In contrast, I don't see what your plane crash analogy has to do with anything. The analogy is about how something normally dangerous like a lump wouldn't matter if you were already dying much faster, but how does this relate to dating? Will you face impending doom for rejecting a woman over her body count?
Furthermore, you yourself said that you "don't want a chick who's fucked 100 guys either", which means that a girl's partner count is not irrelevant to you like you claimed earlier. It may not be a primary concern, but it's clearly not irrelevant either. The fact that you wouldn't want to date a chick like that also means that there is something that you can do about your partner's sexual history, which is to simply not date them. As for the rest of your post, I'm not telling you to find a virgin wife or something like that. I only pointed out that if you "have to accept" or "would rather not know" something (both of which are your wording in a previous post), then that something is not irrelevant to you. An irrelevant factor is something that simply doesn't matter, like whether your partner likes the color red or blue more. No one would ever say that they would prefer not to know their partner's favorite color or that they just had to accept it, because nobody cares about that.
<comment>
I think 10 is a fair number. I'm not convinced it's double or triple, but I could be wrong. 
"Massive sexual history" is referencing my own phrasing in previous posts. I would consider, around 30+ to be quite a large amount and 100 to be "massive". 
I've actually had 12 sexual partners and could happily settle down and have sex with only that person for the rest of my life, so for me, anecdotally, that number for average partners checks out.
I could understand if someone had 20 sexual partners, at 30 I would be feel a bit disgusted. It's all subjective. If I had had 30 then I'm sure I wouldn't care so much.
<comment>
it has for me but probably not for everyone
<comment>
Most normal people don't care about finding a virgin to settle down with because they don't believe retarded theories about pair bonding, vagina stretching, and aren't insecure about their sexual value.
historically, in virtually all cultures, virginity was highly valued, and women who werent virgins literally were sold to whore houses to work there. for thousands of years, across many cultures and continents and races, men were adamant about getting a virgin wife. this was a very serious cultural tradition
and those theories are backed up by science, you illiterate retard. its back up by scientific data. its not just wild speculation, there strong evidence that justifies belief in those
and most men do want youth and inexperience. how can you love a girl when you know she fucked 12 guys before you, all of which were much better than you? she was riding the cock carousel while you were dying inside of loneliness. she was out partying and doing drugs with musicians, while you were alone and unloved. and when she's a old used up hag who lost her looks, now you want to get with her? are you a troll?
all men find youth sexy and attractive
<comment>
im just kind of confused so be patient with me please. 10+ lets say is fair number for high or no? this does not mean massive, i want to be clear again when i say this.
<comment>
There's nothing you can do about your partner having a average sexual history
sure there is. you can just say "fuck off you worthless whore" and go be alone. and die alone
you dont need to be with someone's discarded cumrag. a girl who had teenage love with chad, sucked off brad and his buddies, did drugs with sanches, got fucked by her favorite musicians, prostituted a bit for shits and giggles, fucked tyrone and friends, and dated tinder chads
you dont need to be with that. you can just be alone. 
For most people, it's a silly jealous thought that they shrug off 
more cope. most men are just so desperate for any drop of pussy, they settle with used up hag roasties after they been ran through. once theyr'e fat, their face is leathery, and they cant get with chads anymore
<comment>
I do not avoid the truth, I am well aware of the truth, I am even disgusted by the truth, but it still does not bother me. Girls also shit, puke, and spit out babies from their swollen abdomens, all of which are simple facts of life and on a visceral level disgust me.
The point of my analogy is that, even though something may be a cause for concern, it can be made irrelevant by a greater cause for concern.
This would correspond with the concern that your potential partner is not a virgin, and the greater concern that you will be alone for the rest of your life.
I think the problem of a partner with an extreme body count is an edge case which doesn't effect most people. For this reason, I'm only arguing in the case of a partner with an average body count.
Your lump analogy doesn't fit. If I find a lump, and I recognise the truth of it, I can get it checked out, I can fight to not die from it.
What is recognising the truth of a potential partner not being a virgin? Chasing the fantasy of a virgin? Swearing off all sex? Both are losing states.
<comment>
historically we have done a lot of retarded and fucked up stuff. I don't care about tradition or culture.
Why is there the assumption that the "12 guys before you" were all better than you? You're projecting your inadequacy. 
sure that sounds fine.
Okay have fun being alone. Being alone isn't a solution, it's literally a cope. There's nothing you can do, except cope with being alone. Projecting much?
<comment>
historically we have done a lot of retarded and fucked up stuff. I don't care about tradition or culture.
the point is that, most men, throughout all of recorded human history, valued and prefered virgin wives. no man likes used up whores
Being alone isn't a solution, it's literally a cope
its not a cope, its just a rejection of trash. when females swipe left on incels, they arent coping. they are just rejecting trash men for better elite men
the same i will do. i cannot love on a used up gutterslut whore. and those whores cant pairbond or love either way, and they will never truly love me, because they settled for me because they cant get anyone better. they will resent me for not being the chads that ran through them
except cope with being alone
yes. i have to cope with being alone. this is very difficult to do, but its preferable to loving on used up whores, without question. life is cruel to a man who want to experience love. this world is a very cruel place, and its a struggle just to survive, especially for an autist like myself. but god has not pushed me to suicide yet, im still breathing

Why is there the assumption that the "12 guys before you" were all better than you? You're projecting your inadequacy.
because statistically, they were. when women are young, they are on top of the world. and they pick men who are the best. they pick handsome men, dominant men with big dicks, dark triad confident psychopaths, rich men, neurotypical men. they dont pick losers when they have better options. and every single man find young women attractive, as i shown in this pic >>73126271
but when they get old, they cant keep these elite men, so unless they want to die alone, they have to date lower quality men
men who are shy, who are ugly, who are poor, who never got any pussy until they showed up. men who have mental illnesses or small dicks or are balding
when these used up cumrags listen to love songs, it wont be you who they're thinking of, it will be their first boyfriend, or the guy who beat them until they developed stockholm syndrome love for them, or the guy that made her bleed every time they fucked, or whatever chad they actually fell in love with
these women are not capable of loving losers. they spent their entire lives rejecting and being disgusted by these loser men. at best they will lie to them because they need money or want someone to be with, but they cannot pairbond

dark triad confident psychopaths
you've just outed yourself as a andrew tate/red-pill theorist retard
women, by large, do not find narcissist and psychopaths attractive. have you ever spoken to a woman?
<comment>
No. It unfortunately gets way harder. Even the courting process sucks.
I'll take the economy crashing anytime.

and that's where the scientific blackpill comes in to take a large shit down your throat
you made claims, anon, but you havent provided any evidence. anecdotes are not evidence that is reasonably to justify belief. studies are much more reasonable. and claims made without evidence can be reasonably dismissed without evidence
here is a whole bunch of studies to back up being a neurotypical or dark triad, links related
you fucking retard, run your fucking mouth

damn you hit hard with a bunch of links to some incel wiki. what is your argument again? cucking to a bunch of "studies" you probably haven't even read. Point me to specific data because I am not reading that shite.

I do not avoid the truth
Your words about not wanting to know your partner's body count says otherwise. The fact that you say this while simultaneously insisting that it's irrelevant just proves that it indeed does matter to you. This very obvious contradiction means that you're either lying to us or to yourself.
The point of my analogy is that, even though something may be a cause for concern, it can be made irrelevant by a greater cause for concern.
Which is what I explained in my post, but you ignored the fact that this doesn't actually have anything to do with the point I was making. Also, the reason why the plane crash in your analogy is even a problem in the first place is because it will get you much faster than the cancer will. This is not the case with your scenario where you will be forever alone if you reject someone based on their body count.
I think the problem of a partner with an extreme body count is an edge case which doesn't effect most people. For this reason, I'm only arguing in the case of a partner with an average body count.
Like I said, I'm not telling you to find a virgin wife. I'm not sure if you think you're arguing with some other anon or if you are trying to misrepresent my point. You said that your partner's body count is irrelevant to you, while also mentioning that you just have to deal with it and that you'd rather not know. I'm pointing out the contradiction there.
Your lump analogy doesn't fit. If I find a lump, and I recognise the truth of it, I can get it checked out, I can fight to not die from it.
How do you seemingly first understand the point of the comparison and then manage to misunderstand it afterwards? The whole idea is that people realize that the lump might be bad news, but don't get themselves checked because, in your words, "they'd rather not know". And again, I'm not arguing in favor of a virgin wife, so I'm not sure what you're getting at here.

damn you hit hard with a bunch of links to some incel wiki
yes. just because its on a incel wiki site doesnt mean its not valid. if proof to a math theorem was posted on a incel website, does that invalidate it? thats just a adhom. its science, anon. these are studies conducted by people who are not incels, but prove incel theories
Point me to specific data because I am not reading that shite
thats okay, just dont expect to be taken seriously, or expect to be taken in good faith, when you dismiss scientific evidence that contradicts your braindamaged position
you worthless fucking retard. you're a joke, honestly

Based and truthpilled.

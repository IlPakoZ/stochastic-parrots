Why are women with mental problems/traumatic experiences more likely to have weird unique kinks and interest in non-conventionally attractive men? Like what's the connection? Why are healthy women all NPCs?
Because Chad dumped them and it's too traumatic to chase after a chad again
They have more experience with being mistreated, and thus they have more empathy. This is also the reason why rich people have less empathy than poor people, because they experience less hardship in their lives.
Of course it's safe to say that TOO much hardship is not exactly a good thing, at some point you begin to resent other people so much that you go back around and start to lose your sense of empathy.
Be a weirdo.
Be mentally ill.
Be into mentally ill weird shit.
Not so hard to figure out, most men don't have weird fetishes either. The weirdest thing a normalfag is into is like spanking or light bdsm.
Because the only reason that a woman wouldn't exclusively be into Chad is that she's brain-damaged.
the default state of being of women is being an uninteresting vapid NPC.
trauma and suffering builds character which can create actual unique traits in people. Westworld was right, it is human suffering that gives us sentience and an understanding of the world.
People who live their lives without any major problems are not real people. They aren't really 'there'. they just exist, like robots. NPCs if you will.

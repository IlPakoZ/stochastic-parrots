Do you ever wonder what you did in a past life to deserve being born into this Hellish life of suffering, cruelty and despair? 
What do you think it was?
(not me in pic)
When hes White. Do not swipe Right.
Famous saying amongst White girls now a days.
my whole life is wasted potential
but im lazy and shy
I don't think you have to do anything bad necessarily.
You either don't have a choice in the matter or were dumb enough to get tricked into coming back again.
Maybe the afterlife gets boring after awhile idk.
Its nothing to do with potential or waste. You were born an incel, you will die an incel. Genetics is destiny.
Do you think you get to relive lives you have already lived? Like do you think if I died tomorrow I could be go back to January 1, 2020 at Midnight with my current memories and consciousness?
bump for the sake of originality

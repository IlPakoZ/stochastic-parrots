I just wanted to talk and solve this stupid year without abandonment and hurt. I wanted love and the family we would have. I'm fucking terrified and depressed. We could've just talked by now. We could've done something. I wanted love and happiness ;_;
You are the only person I have in this entire world and you won't even speak to me. I just wanted to talk. I wanted a family. I wanted to be happy together with you I want things to be ok
Find me 
Just please remember how much I meant to you I never wanted to fight I never wanted this to be how things are I have lost everything I am without you and I'd do anything in the world just for us to reconnect
Nobody can replace me just come back home to me I just wanted us forever to have as much fun as did sitting next to eachother and more. I love you

We both did things that weren't quite right and I acted a little weird because I found stuff but I trusted you sheep.. I think we should just talk

I just want someone to love like I loved Meaghan. Maybe we could get to know each other.
<comment>
I don't know who you are but I'm sorry no one ever cared about me the way she cared and loved me for so long and I always tried my best to give all of my love to her, I don't know if she'll ever respond but I have nothing and no one.. I only wish I had love and happiness but I don't think anyone would ever

i would like us to get to know each other, id be lying if i said i dont have a crush on you. the way that you are so passionate is so cute, i just want to take care of you and make all the pain go away. but i just dont think it's right, at least not yet. i also feel nervous that i wouldnt compare to your past girlfriend. i think i should wait a little more before i try to pursue anything with you. even though i really really want to. ill be watching these threads closely still.

You sound lovely. I think I could love again even after the Meaghan stuff but as long as you love and care for me just as much as I would. We should at least talk privately more, here's my discord

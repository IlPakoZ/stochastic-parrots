I grok that pic so hard lmao
Lack of chadcock
Same conditions that make an incel, I'd think.
Bad experiences or lack of exposure that leads to low self esteem which leads to even further bad experiences and reinforces further negativity. A lot of women are socialized to base their worth off of looks or desirability as a romantic partner. If they're reacted to negatively and without proper coping mechanisms, they'll be much more withdrawn and turn to similar escapist outlets seen in incel spaces that coddle their social and emotional ineptitude.
She's actually only 20 there! I would love to have a cutie quiet and reserved girlfriend, but I'm 32 now and I wasted my whole life. It wouldn't even work, my heart feels broken.

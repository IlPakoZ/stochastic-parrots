What causes a girl to turn into a femcel? And I mean actual girls, not men who consumed too much porn and now think they're women.

pale skin from always spending time indoors
long hair because she doesn't like going out to get it cut

dog she's too emotionally attached too because it's the only physical contact she gets
phone nearby to answer discord which she's only every waking hour
Her parents don't understand anything about the cartoon but get the cake for her because it's the only thing they know about her

Same conditions that make an incel, I'd think.
Bad experiences or lack of exposure that leads to low self esteem which leads to even further bad experiences and reinforces further negativity. A lot of women are socialized to base their worth off of looks or desirability as a romantic partner. If they're reacted to negatively and without proper coping mechanisms, they'll be much more withdrawn and turn to similar escapist outlets seen in incel spaces that coddle their social and emotional ineptitude.

She's actually only 20 there! I would love to have a cutie quiet and reserved girlfriend, but I'm 32 now and I wasted my whole life. It wouldn't even work, my heart feels broken.

Be near female of the same species
Fight or flight response engages 
What?????
just stop being black opie
I feel the same around moids. I dont like their energy.
be like this
women seem physically attracted to me
in interaction they realize that my fight or flight is active and I'm nervous
they lose interest and treat me like I'm scum
The worst part is that if I just slammed down on a bar or smashed a chair or moved aggressively towards one they'd change their tune real quick from feel contempt to being afraid, and I would get to be the one who can look down on them
Women do not even notice how most of the time any interaction with them gets emotionally painful
and then are surprised about 
Fight or flight response

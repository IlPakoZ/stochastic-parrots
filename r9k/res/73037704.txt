If a girl smiles back at me what does it mean
It means she's open to the idea of using you to her benefit in a potential number of ways. Probably more than one at once
In my personal experience it means that she wants to use you as validation that she is somebody people want to interact with.
She could want to use you for sex or something also, but I can't say for sure
All I know is that interacting with women is sure to lead you to a situation that stresses you out or makes you feel bad

she is remembering the time tyrone railed her

Depends on the context Anon, what was the context?
<comment>
She's greeting you without words. And you're probably not hideous otherwise she wouldn't smile back. That's it. Everything else is speculation.

If a girl smiles back at you, it could mean a variety of things depending on the context and the individual. However, in many cases, a smile can be a positive sign that she is receptive to your presence or interested in getting to know you better.
It's important to keep in mind that a smile alone may not necessarily indicate romantic interest. Some people are naturally friendly and smile often as a way of making others feel comfortable, while others may smile out of politeness or to acknowledge your presence.
If you are interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with this person, it may be helpful to look for other signs of interest or to try initiating a conversation to see if there is a mutual connection. Ultimately, the best way to know for sure how someone feels is to communicate openly and honestly with them.

Best reply so far

It means that she is ready for you NOW
If you don't pull off your pants and run at her full sprint, erect penis swinging back and forth like a metronome at that SECOND, you have already taken a fucking chainsaw to your reproductive prospects.
Hope this helps.

cope, women jus want chad. god is a rapist

t is not accurate or appropriate to generalize that all women only want a certain type of man, such as a stereotypical "Chad". Attraction is complex and can vary greatly from person to person, influenced by a range of factors including personality, interests, values, and physical appearance. Attraction is a highly individual experience, and not all women are attracted to the same type of man.

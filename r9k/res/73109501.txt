Finish essay a day before it's due
Review everything and instructions
Instructions
I forgot to read the instructions
The paper I wrote does not align with the instructions at all
No time to rewrite it
How fucked am I
Dude who cares the world is probably gonna explode one day anyway, chill tf out
Does your class allow essay revisions?
College or HS? Honestly, most colleges don't even read half the shit you write. If you meet the page requirement, have sources, and pass the plagarism check, you're gonna make a 40 easy.
How the fuck did you mess up on the easiest part? lmao
Still better than me
read instructions properly
only start working on the essay AFTER the due date
Chatgpt is ur only hope. Get an essay from there and throw it into Quillbot

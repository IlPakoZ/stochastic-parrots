Which eye am I supposed to be looking at when making eye contact?
Follower shooter rules, aim between the eyes
The third eye (their forehead)
I hate making eye contact, it feels like a threat
it's called eye contact, your eyes are supossed to touch
Sounds gaaay
Depends if you want them to make eye contact again, it's okay if you squint one but if you don't want them to do it again you should squint a lot. Especially if they got a boyfriend or something. If someone asks why you're looking at them like that and you haven't stole their wallet yet if nobody else is around you know what to do.
Alternate from one eye to the other, then slowly move close and say P E N I S!
I shift from eye to eye. Is that weird?
This scares me I always think they are looking for me to make a mistake
I pretend to be blind in one eye when talking to people cause I don't have to worry about looking at them inappropriately cause of the peripheral vision in both eyes confusing me
Don't do this, I knew a guy who did this once, it's not the biggest deal in the world but it is noticeable. Just land on whatever eye you unthinkingly go to and stick there
uuh yeah
Imagine my shock lol.
Why do normalnigs obsess so much over this eye shit anyway? I lost count of how many times my mother REEE'd at me for not making eye contact when I was a kid.

Why does everything have to be so fucking complicated, why couldn't I just have been a normal fucking person
I know bro. I know exactly how you feel. It feels like I'm just going through a maze at times. Being abnormal is the ultimate curse. I kinda think it would've been better if I were born blind and sociable instead of being perfectly normal with no ailments, but awkward and autistic as hell.
Yeah, feels like you can run into a trap any time. Sucks.

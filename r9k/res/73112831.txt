First for fakegaycels fuck off!!!
<comment>
They are putting my uncle's dog down today. I'm gonna miss her. She was a strong girl, almost as old as me. 
Do you have dogs r9gay?
<comment>
Griffith was a villain. What makes you think I'd risk this precious peace I've found at last for someone like that?
<comment>
I'm gonna miss her
prison gay
<comment>
He did nothing wrong when you think about it. And I'd risk everything in my life to find eternal love.
<comment>
What a beautiful, sunny day. No bf to go for a walk n talk with :(((
<comment>
Really? Would you give up on being a bad person and become good instead?
<comment>
I don't like being a bad person. I'm on my redemption arc.
<comment>
GAYFFITS!!!
<comment>
You must speak citizens of r9gay!
<comment>
Fine, I'll hold your hand and hold you accountable.
<comment>
shy boys who are very dominant in bed >~&lt;
<comment>
Quiet doesn't always mean shy. Sometimes it's more stoic and aloof.
<comment>
Cute.
Me desu desu
<comment>
trooned out cuz hair loss (not receding but not thick enough for long hair
wake up thinking it was all a nightmare
look down and see cone tits
I'm not sure if i made the right decision
<comment>
I want a bf, but the thought of having such a shared life is weird
<comment>
yeah, i'm not sure i'm willing to give up my solitary and comfortable bohemian lifestyle just for a bf who will probably break up with me at some point anyways
<comment>
I'm a shy boy but I'm not dominant in bed
<comment>
I just don't want people making fun of me for how retarded I am when it comes to basic tasks
<comment>
I am taking husband applications for long haired beautiful boys who want to spend their life with me. Also I am going to take a nap I need a rest.
<comment>
i have long hair and may be beautiful. but of what persuasion of person does anon belong to?
<comment>
he belongs to the nigger kind
<comment>
Just- uh, ow, just, cut your fingernails, please.
<comment>
tfw a long haired not that attractive boy
<comment>
Venti did you ever actually have a boyfriend?
<comment>
he's had three in the past month
<comment>
Perfect husbands!
<comment>
That can be true. I was thinking more of easily embarrassed boys who have teouble speaking up in public.
Me desu desu
Well in that case i would like to inform you that you have the best of both worlds, a perfect combination! It's very cute aaaaaa
That's most shy boys T_T
It's still cute anon, don't worry
<comment>
It's still cute anon, don't worry
thx, but it's not fun being too shy ;_;
<comment>
Oh my god you are literally me o_o
<comment>
Long hair is overrated. It can look good on some guys and everything beats buzzcut and bald but medium lenghts is best. You get bonus points for not looking like a tranny or hipster jesus
<comment>
For heaven's sake, anon. They were cousins!
<comment>
thick fluffy hair is best :3
<comment>
I personally really liked Golden Kamuy and Berserk (never tried the anime, never will).
<comment>
straight royals married their cousins, why can't gay cousins? Plus no inbred kids with hemophilia.
<comment>
I can't exactly argue against that.
<comment>
also they both got tattoos when they went aboard as young men, so they were not stuffy uptight prissy princes.
<comment>
Does your dick still work or did you break that too
<comment>
I eat too much sweets
<comment>
I want a bf so bad but I can't use tinder so I'm stuck looking for love on grindr
<comment>
GOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING R9GAYNGSTERS
ANOTHER DAY DAWNS ON OUR GLORIOUS THREAD(shut up i know its nearly 3pm)

<comment>
I miss 2009. Did a lot of ecstasy with my cute hs friends when I was cute. Sadly we never fucked. Fuxk life I want to die now.
<comment>
not looking like a tranny or hipster jesus 
that's only for guys who don't know how to style it properly.
<comment>
I'm rocking unkempt long hair with no bangs as I'm balding. I would never cut my long hair though, I love it too much.
<comment>
Start finasteride, go full wizard mode with long luscious silver hair.
<comment>
Unironically schizoids are happy when being alone. Beat that.
<comment>
doesn't that give you ED? I like my fapping more.
<comment>
These studies which are discussed below reveal that sexual adverse effects occur at the rates of 2.1% to 3.8%, erectile dysfunction (ED) being the most common followed by ejaculatory dysfunction and loss of libido. These effects occurred early in the therapy and returned to normal on stopping or over a time on continuous use of the drug. The only causal relation between finasteride and sexual adverse effects is decreased ejaculatory volume because of predominant action of DHT on prostate.
tl;dr yes but no. At first it's *possible (below 5%) but apparently as you continue the regimen that goes away. You might coom less but you'll still orgasm just fine.
<comment>
Oh I thought he meant eating disorder
i mean anon you're getting kind of fat maybe you should have one tee hee
<comment>
 A comprehensive review of a total of 73 papers on medical therapies for BPH was conducted, with a focus on the effects of different pharmacological agents on sexual function. The review revealed that finasteride is infrequently associated with problems of ejaculation (2.1-7.7%), erection (4.9-15.8%), and libido (3.1-5.4%).
The role of nocebo effect in the causation of ED due to finasteride has been investigated. Nocebo effect refers to an adverse effect that results from the psychological awareness of the possibility of the side effects, but is not a direct result of the specific pharmacological action of the drug. In this study, the group informed about the sexual adverse effects of finasteride reported increased incidence of ED, when compared to the group without information.

Seems to be more of a "you can psych yourself into disabling your dick" problem.
<comment>
What if I already have ED?
<comment>
We posting scientiffic papers now?
<comment>
We posting scientific papers now
It's not like it was unprompted

<comment>
Please don't bully me drunkanon I am american and my skin is white as mentioned before.
<comment>
americans are all gross retards
<comment>
tfw no fact checker bf
<comment>
Hard question to answer but I consider myself damned and ambitious. I wanna be the best version of myself.
<comment>
I will admit America is fucked however your country did not go to the moon. Our country did. Even when our country declines into a Latin American tier shithole we will still hold the title of first people to land on the moon while your country will have nothing.
<comment>
Your country is not white tho
<comment>
uhmm but racial demographics
Yeah I know its fucked thats why I said its fucked however we landed on the moon and you did not.
<comment>
We got guns and the best food.
<comment>
implying the moon landing was real
<comment>
In an ideal fantasy world we'd break up like Yugoslavia and I would be declared king of the Atlantic states of America and I'd first TND TJD TTD and then I'd set up a harem of cute boys which all live in my fancy Maine estate.
<comment>
No no, I mean even "white" americans ain't really white
<comment>
I'm so fuckin lonely and I'm going to kill myself
<comment>
Me soon too probably.
<comment>
Please don't joke about that.
<comment>
we have so much in common, we should kiss
<comment>
Well that's a lie. Miscegenation was frowned upon by most of society even into the 70s. Race mixing isn't even common with in the united states. 
People moving in from another country does not change the ancestry of the people already living there. We unlike the people south of the border our colonists were never super rapey with the natives. Its like saying all South Africans are white because Dutch and English colonists settled there. I've had this argument before so I'm just gonna quote Wikipedia
From the 23andMe database, about 5 to at least 13 percent of self-identified white American Southerners have greater than 1 percent African ancestry.[78] Southern states with the highest African American populations tended to have the highest percentages of hidden African ancestry.[79] White Americans (European Americans) on average are: "98.6 percent European, 0.19 percent African and 0.18 percent Native American.
Unless you're gonna claim that being .37 percent non white on average means black as coal.

<comment>
Please... I need to cuddle
<comment>
Why is there a bus stop at the hospital roof?
<comment>
this bus goes to a farm upstate

What a surprise, annoying coalburners want to drag us down too.
<comment>
Oy ese somos jotos you ain't allowed in our block no more chingada madre!
<comment>
I need a cute but strict library bf
<comment>
Now you can cite your sources and defend that position while i can post memes and smug anime girls. You do know who is going to win, right?
<comment>
smug anime girls
NO ANON NO PLEASE NO DEAR GOD NO PLEASE IM SORRY!!!!
<comment>
white is a colonial invention which is why ONLY protestants from britain and netherlands are truly white and protestants from the rest of northern europe are white adjacent. anything else is a corruption of the term forced by germany because they were to disorganized to do anything good before the end of 19th century but they wanted to be white(they failed so they decided to ruin racial science for everyone white instead)
<comment>
Yeah but no one uses White like that. We live in the 21st century(sadly) White just means anyone of European descent.
<comment>
I accept my victory with grace. You did good but you need at least 10 more years of practice to beat me uwu

Post armpit plz
<comment>
Learn about complementary colors and branch out with different accessories and combos. Thrift for this imo because you might need to bulk up your wardrobe. Pay attention to fit and silhouette. Look at other people's clothes and notice them. Like my podiatrist who rocks the newbalance 550s.
<comment>
develop your personal schtyle!
<comment>
Wish i didn't get bored so quickly of trolling foo's. It's more fun than most things.
<comment>
Fashion is easy
Poloshirt with another shirt underneath it
jeans
sneakers
<comment>
Styling does not matter attractiveness is a scam billions must die
<comment>
billions must die

package of supposedly boneless pork chops had bones in them.

<comment>
the bone is good for flavor, just carve it out before serving
<comment>
I dont know if the thread is till up and I'm too lazy too look but this was the webm posted

<comment>
Hungry as fuck and my throat hurts like hell. Thinking about buying some clothes but I'm currently broke. 
How are my r9gay boys doing today? Good I hope.

"bro" type speak
very goofy
very nice and friendly
laughs a lot
dumb
straight but likes to show off
<comment>
nice, sounds hot.
<comment>
i'mma ball without you
<comment>
I don't think I'd like that kind of person. I'd find them annoying and they'd sense it so even if I didn't -really- dislike them they'd avoid me out of politeness.
<comment>
Tbh I'm starting to understand the appeal of body pillows and it scares me. The cat didn't piss on my cringe spot when she pissed on the floor tho so that's nice.
<comment>
Crying spot, not cringe spot.
<comment>
They hate me cuz they ain't me lol
<comment>
tfw no himbo fren to hit the gym with
<comment>
I hate you because you aren't picrelated.
<comment>
I have a bowie knife and i will use it if i have to
<comment>
Cool ig. Do you box though? Or dance ig, same difference?
<comment>
I dance while i box and i box while i dance
<comment>

<comment>
no don't kill yourself dude
Just go to the dating apps and have some fun
<comment>
dude just whore your body out then you won't wanna kill yourselffffff
Actual demon spawn
<comment>
Unfathomably based. I'm learning boxing but I cant learn dance until I lose a few more pounds.
<comment>
You can do more than just whoring around you can like meet someone cool and go to a normal date with them
<comment>
alright gaybots. who here /drunk/ tonight?
<comment>
What's your BMI? Origineh
<comment>
And then have slutty sex and never see them again???
<comment>
Ummm? I'm 6'1, 225 lb. Idk how to calculate BMI. What's origineh? Been running to get that down, shooting for 190
<comment>
sometimes you'll be rejected, others you will be the one doing the rejecting. One time it will work out. 
It only needs to work once
<comment>
dumb newfaggot
<comment>
Fact check true, I am. What about it sparky?
<comment>
You should be ashamed of it.
<comment>
not me, I'm still in work hours and tonight will be too warm
<comment>
I am hispanic sadly
lol my shitpost was right on the money
<comment>
I have no shame, I am literally on r9k.
<comment>
you're not so shameless, you're still a virgin
<comment>
i wonder what average gays think about.
<comment>
How does that make me less shameless? It's not shame but pride that makes me virgin. I don't want to lose my virginity to a mediocre hookup as a pudgy loser lol.
<comment>
Try doing some fancy footwork exercises for boxing. It's kinda like dancing lol
That doesn't seem too bad. Fatties can dance too. What type od dance would you like to learn?
<comment>
use a dating app (not a hookup app) to find a bf, then lose your virginity to him when you're ready.
<comment>
Based and antibrazilpilled
<comment>
I dunno. To be honest, I don't know anything about it.
Yes, but I want to get in shape first.
<comment>
in my mind i can picture a world without war and i hate it
<comment>
I want to abduct him and treat him like this
<comment>
Hallo Hallo!!
Hey anony
What got u horny to-day?
You like gokarts?
I like all cars
Story anon
Hope youre doing well and had a nice birthday, if it happened already!
<comment>
This but i get underneath his shirt and nip at him
<comment>
I don't want to lose my virginity to a mediocre hookup
Is a "mediocre hookup" the best you can get? 
Why don't you lose your virginity in the way that befits your standards?
<comment>
not until may 14th, which this year is also mother's day as a nice little 'fuck you' from the universe.
<comment>
Please don't make fun of me. I am white and americanized. 
Thank you dear sir. 
I am going to take a shower now cause I stink. I haven't eaten all day cause my throat hurts. 
I hope the Peruvian gets killed by his local gang. 
Love you storyanon happy early birthday.
<comment>
When you try, you'll eventually get it right, even if you have to face rejection sometimes
<comment>
want to get in shape first.
Are you on a diet or is this just another excuse? Don't postpone it forever
<comment>
Maybe it's more a bit of encouragement
*hugs*
How you been?
<comment>
do this to me, hug me like you mean it dammit
<comment>
Hehehehe
Thanks for the love venti nony
I hope you get Gangbanged to~~
<comment>
What's your favorite berserk battle tho?
Why's your throat sore?
<comment>
Don't talk to me shitskin. 
I have been reborn into a better person but my hate for south americans and sex havers remain the same. 
Gonna go shower now.
<comment>
about the same, trying to get by day to day. The lawyer didn't call with the medicaid bill so I'll likely call on Monday to ask what's happening with that.
Once I get that, like I have said before, I'll be able to know if I keep the house or not.
<comment>
you're still the same lonely gay dying for a bf. You just can't admit it
<comment>
Earlier in the thread you said you were hispanic
you ARE the shitskin, shitskin
<comment>
How much money do you have right now? How exactly are you buying food and stuff?
<comment>
Im probably as white as u r
Have a nice shower!
I will pester you as long as you post here
Show legos! Show plushies!! 
Go have sex as well and let's be fwens!!
<comment>
Why do you stink?
<comment>
I have over 200k in the bank right now, as well as a credit card which I use to buy everything, then pay off the bill every month so I don't get interest.
<comment>
He has like 200k but he's shit with money
<comment>
Have you looked for cash stashes around the house?
Some people keep those
Hmm.
Also
This is been long, i guess you rather not deal with it much but, you should maybe start asking around and think of a different lawyer
<comment>
Remember to stay hidrated boys
<comment>
I have very white skin. 
I'm honestly gonna what berserk right now after I shower. It sounds really good. I got a flu or something I feel fucked up.
<comment>
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
<comment>
this is already the second one I've been to. Plus it may not be in yet, he said it takes around 4-5 weeks and it's just now going on 4.
as for cash stashes, mom liked to pay cash for things so I have roughly 2000 in cash that was in the safe. I don't think she's put money anywhere else, and if my grandparents did we'd have found it by now, or it was taken by the workers before we moved in.
<comment>
SENOR TRUMP PLEAAASE GIVE ME GREEN CARD I AM MUCHO BLANCA WHITEO PLEASE!!!!
<comment>
Here in Peru people think the flu is a myth
You should try sleeping some, dry your hair well and get plushies!!
My favorite of aaaaaall fights i think it's against the angels/inquisitors
Hmm
Or. When Griffiths saves the capital
<comment>
I just surprised my husband with some lovely cologne and I think he enjoyed it a lot!
<comment>
bitch you don't have a husband
<comment>
At least I'm trying to cook and be frugal with money. I could order takeout for every meal.
<comment>
thinks he's white because police shoots at him with heavy southern accent
<comment>
Who said history can't be fun?
https://youtu.be/S5_YiVgd5wY [Embed]
<comment>
I see, oh well, how your cooking going?
Have you watched vids on it ?
<comment>
Anon, that's a risky move imo But glad it went well
<comment>
Just in case you're not aware: buying food to cook is cheaper than eating out, so try to do that as much as you can
<comment>
Yes I do. I love him a lot.
Thanks! he really loves my care for him.
<comment>
Imagine if you took the time you spend on videogames and put it into dating apps
<comment>
decent. my only major fuck up was on Monday when I tried to cook a chuck steak in the skillet instead of the oven like mom always did. It was burned on the outside but still too rare for my liking instead, but mostly it so tough and fatty I couldn't eat most of it. 
Today I went to the store and got a bunch of meat, so I'm planning on cooking most days this week.
<comment>
husband
boyfriend
These people need to be holocausted. You come into my threads. My homeland and wreck up the place and expect me to sit down and take it. No. Our patience runs out boyfriend haver. Soon you will not be tolerated. 
TOTAL BFH DEATH

<comment>
yeah bro wanna suck my dick in the back of a taco bell
No thanks.
<comment>
Or you could just get a bf and chill
<comment>
Oh I'm quite aware and knew this before mom passed away. Going out somewhere was always much more expensive than cooking. We normally ate out once a week, either a fast place or a pizza. I have kept this pattern for the most part, except in the first few weeks where I did order pizza a lot.
<comment>
Boys wearing thongs can't be beat.
<comment>
That sounds nice
Hopefully will be very yum next times
<comment>
Oh yes, greeks be superior
<comment>
Or you could just go to taco bell and get some food and talk. Have you tried that? 
That's all it takes. You'd know that if you had tried.
<comment>
He always has appreciated my cooking the most! I always feel beloved by him on a daily basis.
<comment>

<comment>
Possible new kanye album soon I'm excited.
<comment>
further more admitting you like femboys is basically telling the world that you are a creep who should not be allowed around minors. 
Your roman femboy fantasy is straight up just you wanting to fuck a minor. You are a CREEP nigga. You are DISGUSTING nigga!!!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty
<comment>
Sadly I couldn't really find Sims 4 Burqa CC, so I had to settle with the niqab. Lots of dead links.. I make various meals for Mortimer! I made fish and chips for him once. For breakfast I have made him omelettes and toast.
<comment>
True
This is true
<comment>
Oh !!
Those Sound amazing!!!
So yum! So yum! So yum!!
<comment>
it's okay to like femboys when you are young, but need to grow out of them as you age.
Also, what about twinks?
<comment>
Id. Say mostly just same, it stems from the same itch
<comment>
Would you vote for him if he ran for Office?
I heard many muricans joking about it but So they did about Trump
You think it could happen?
<comment>
When I grow old I'll probably have a hard on for guys with mustaches but not right now. Better stick to people my age. I am also pretty feminine so I find it to be less odd for me to like feminine types of men.
<comment>
no one will fuck you
<comment>
What about beards?
<comment>
have sex incel!!!
No way fag!
<comment>
Beards can be good to. It's something I'll have to develop a taste for.
<comment>
dude, you have to like 300lb muscle bound beefcake body builders or you're a pedo!
the absolute sate of masc4masc
<comment>
the /gaygen/ discord is making fun of you fags
<comment>
you are straight if you are attracted to this
<comment>
That is not what anyone said
You are making stuff up in your head
All I said was that people who like femboys are kind of "sus" as the kids say.
<comment>
Tell them to suck my dick Lol.
<comment>
if it doesn't have tits and has a dick and you get hard to it, you're gay.
<comment>
What's /gaygen/ like?

<comment>
That is not what anyone said
yeah, you have to like skinnyfats like you or you aren't gay
<comment>
fit men and people who take care of themselves are not femboys
its a certain aesthetic and kind of mind set and I think you know that
You are completely insane and trying defend pederasty. A man can have a nice body and not also be trying to be as effeminate and young looking as possible
<comment>
yeah, you have to like ugly people like you or you aren't gay
<comment>
tfw no fit and completely insane bf
<comment>
Would you date 17 and a half year old femboy if he was reaaaaaaaaly racist, anon?
<comment>
Are you the underage neet dude on the discords
<comment>
I never said that either
like i said 
you are actively trying to defend pederasty and thats it.
<comment>
I am not underage or neet. I am a dude though
<comment>
you gay sick fuck
<comment>
you do realize that pederasty is gay history right? Like for most of history gay relationships are older men with younger boys, who then grow up to take boys as lovers as the cycle continues.
<comment>
16 is legal here amerinigger
<comment>
what's pedastry
<comment>
Im way too old for that now.
<comment>
Yes and that is disgusting. I do not care about the history of it.
I do not care. Sorry mate but you are a creep.
<comment>
Why do ugly old guys get so defensive when other fags like young looking dudes? Are they really that insecure?
<comment>
being a pedo is okay because the faggots before you did it!!! 
I hope you die. You don't belong here.
<comment>
Post invite faggot !!
<comment>
imagine using the trannycord botnet for any reason
<comment>
I hear they like older guys
<comment>
just lie and say you are 18 and then a few years later when you turn 18 for real be like "surprise". i dont think your boyfriend will hold it against you.
<comment>
How do old anons cope with the fact that no one finds them attractive?

<comment>
mmmm kid cuisine
<comment>

<comment>
You mean the
<comment>
nations values we just had 70 years ago
Couldn't you marry 12 year olds 70 years ago?
<comment>
well I'm not old but I have question why are you here? 
people find me attractive thats why im in the gay incel thread 
you are ugly dude, no one finds you attractive either.
<comment>
I'm attractive and old.
<comment>
you can do that in some states now I'm pretty sure 
however its a moral thing
even in the 50s child marriage was not normal nor moral.
<comment>
yes but in reality that was rare. Most people married in their early 20s.
<comment>
young are pretty but essentially walking lobotomies
older are ugly and dinged up but otherwise not completely retarded
there's no winning either way desu just leave me to my shitposting i don't want anyone i don't want anything anymore
<comment>
there's a nice middle ground in your mid-upper 20s where you aren't dumb and impulsive but still decently cute.
<comment>
I get compliments by strangers on the street way too often lol
you are ugly dude, no one finds you attractive either.
your mom thinks i'm a cutie ;) 
<comment>
so do irl gay friends say 'I fucked your dad' instead of I fucked your mom?
<comment>
yeah tell me about it, it's lonely here in no man's land. in any case it's temporary and not worth playing the roulette wheel just to have him or you get ugly and then have the relationship break down at this point
<comment>

old guys are ugly
They really aren't. Men peak in their 30s. 
You're just a pedophile
<comment>
Seriously? She deserves a better son and i mean that *spits*
<comment>
old wrinkly dudes in their 60s and 70s are ugly though. 30 is not old, despite all trolling by zoomers here.
<comment>
not shaving armpits is ew
<comment>
idk i think it's fine as long as you don't sweat. i've come around on hair, it's basically like a bit of added softness.
<comment>
why would i do that originally speaking
<comment>
I've never had more than peach fuzz on my armpits.
<comment>
I feel like I look average but I've had a lot of sus horny sounding comments directed at my appearance.
<comment>
i will be slim, silver and elfin in my 60s and 70s
<comment>
too lazy to shave
ive been hairy since I was like 14
<comment>
Shaved my arms a week ago. It's okay but I miss my hair. 
Also I'm thinking about waxing because body hair and facial hair is annoying as fuck but I don't know how to use wax.
<comment>
So i can pick a blade that best suits you. I will end you, that much is certain, but i'm a nice guy. I will choose the weapon that best suits you. Think about it
<comment>
choose whichever. give me the express service please and thank you
<comment>
I don't understand fags who like bodyhair. It's so much nicer to touch smooth legs than to feel bodyhair between your fingers. This isn't debatable. Try it out.
Not to mention it looks better.
<comment>
It's not hard
Tho, id advice you get a wax melter, maybe try veet instead or waxing pads
They are somewhat cheaper and easy to use
Wax is a bit hard to keep warm long enough, and Pulling does hurt a lot
Why you. Miss your hair?
<comment>
Not having pithair just feels weird to me. Don't exactly miss it though. I will ask one of my female relatives about waxing, see if I can get any sort of response.
<comment>
I wanna lick hairless armpits mmmmmmmm
<comment>
I shaved my armpits once but it was pretty uncomfortable and it grew back pretty quickly. Not worth
<comment>
Pithair ?
I see
Never had it, i figure it would be uncomfy
Tho i guess the itch would be too
<comment>
hormone disorder or underage?
<comment>
Bodyhair is one of the best things about men
Lonely virgin with pedophilic vibes disagree
Shocker
<comment>
You're thinking about waxing because you're a self declared tranny
<comment>
Forcefully shave all men
<comment>
Pretty sure both underaged boys and girls have pit hair
<comment>
Not only troons be into it
Feeling soft is the best
<comment>
No. Feel free to remain a virgin
<comment>
Disorder
Im the cum demon!!
Haunting the thread
Also i did hrt for a while, so i guess that kind of aggravated it
<comment>
If you mean arm pit
Nop, actually not all people have much body hair
<comment>
I don't like seing him awake at strange times. What is he even doing now? Weirdo
<comment>
He's not going to fuck you bro
<comment>
doesn't like body hair
literally a tranny
It checks out
<comment>
Or anybody, lmao
<comment>
I didn't get mine until 15 and I was definitely using this site before then so I'm sure there are people here young enough to not have armpit hair.
Probably the hormone blockers. Estrogen won't prevent armpit hair. Also just more proof that the bullshit about hormone blockers being "reversible" "temporary" etc is completely false.
<comment>
Not quite
And I didn't have it before hrt either
<comment>
tfw anon s(((oy)))s out at body hair

Yeah, it is bullshit

Can you tell me why trannies are all such horrible people? When I first found out about them as a kid I thought they were like everyone else, with some being bad and some being good. But I've yet to meet a good one, they've all been just completely rotten people. Just recently I was playing an indie game with a small playerbase and a tranny was in the multiplayer mode being a piece of shit for no reason. Like what is the point, and why is it always so constant? Before that, I was in a chatroom and a tranny got mad at two other users for talking about a topic that he thought was boring. But he wasn't even online at the time when the other two started talking.
<comment>
You don't sound like a good person yourself
<comment>
Trannies are bad because my post sounded mean? Have you discovered a secret related to reverse causality that I'm unaware of?
<comment>
i forgot how boring you fags can be
<comment>
Well
There's many thing, emotional instability, neglect of other problems they have, not passing, puching that fact on other people as a way to lash out, Lack of empathy, some also get mad over politics or how the community uses them, some get involved with toxic sides of it
Even myself, don't think I'm out of this
So yeah, maybe we aren't good people, but i don't think it's everyone
Maybe just all that have to say they were or are part of it
<comment>
Not that anon but I think its just due to them being entitled because every corporation and media influencer and such has bent the knee completely to them and they are also just mentally ill even ignoring the transgenderism itself being mental illness. All trannies have some form of problem with their brain. Whether it be bpd or schizophrenia or depression or anxiety. They are all basketcases who hate themselves. These people are probably not gonna be figures which people want to look up to.
<comment>
Yeah
A bit harsh but youre not that far, tho i think you are mostly talking about those who get very into the lgbt community and make it their whole personality
<comment>
every corporation and media influencer and such has bent the knee completely to them
They really haven't.

Don't let your self hatred make you side with people who hate you

Dude straight up I'm Yukio Mishima mode(no i have not read his books. All I know is that he was a faggot and a based Nationalist. Oh and he looked cool)
<comment>
mishima was pretty based. confessions of a mask and especially forbidden colors bleed with the utmost kino homosexuality-steeped-in-severe-misogyny that will basically never be seen again in japan or out of.
<comment>
Thanks nony
Maybe there *is* some of that in there
<comment>
I don't even understand how disliking transgenders means self hatred. Its not like you're hating a group you are in. You are hating a completely separate people from you.
<comment>
trans ""people"" aren't people
<comment>
I always see people online talking about how ___ tranny is "one of the good ones", but it always ends up being fake. I see all these names being pushed around, contrapoints, blair white... but they are all just more of the same. Condescending, passive aggressive, inconsiderate, rude.
The thing is I never wanted to be a hater, but they just won't stop being so hateable. Growing up on the internet, I would read all sorts of racist things about blacks, but I never developed a racist attitude towards them, and over time as I met more of them in real life my notion that they were mostly good people was confirmed. Same thing with mexicans, jews, gays, whatever group. Only when it comes to trans is it impossible to find good people no matter how hard I tried.
<comment>
Do you guys... like other guys?
<comment>
Anon don't tell anyone else this but... 
*whispers*
Yes.
<comment>
he wasn't gay
<comment>
and if you look west with the right pair of eyes at sunset in summer you can just about see the high watermark where the crest turned back and crocs never again achieved that level of success
<comment>
Again, i tho this mostly the ones that get too much into it for being more nby, not passing and into lgbt groups way too much
Otherwise
How would you even know they are trans? Trans people really don't want to shout it out or talk about it
The ones who do have more issues that aren't always propperly addresed
Personally i just know of one or 2 internet peoples who look creepy, haven't dealt with other trans people at all
<comment>
Mishima visited gay bars in Japan.[116] Mishima's sexual orientation was an issue that bothered his wife, and she always denied his homosexuality after his death
Look maybe he was just getting inspiration for his book but idk man
<comment>
visited gay bars
Straight people do this. Probably just curious.
<comment>
Man we need more homosexual nationalists
Ernst Rohm got killed 
Mishima could of not even been a homosexual
Milo yiannopoulos was a fed and pedophile
Douglas P of Death in June may or may not be a larper
I need to get into politics to boost our representation
<comment>
I think the average straight person would probably go to gay bars pretty often if it wasn't considered weird or taboo.
<comment>
no i have not read his books
read his books; you will come to realize he wasn't gay
<comment>
more homosexual nationalists
no, we don't. Lmao for the love of god, just no. The fewer of those, the better
<comment>
hes against representation for our people
wow
the self hatred is wild
<comment>
they are probably great places to get away from women, right?
<comment>
anon please, can't you see the crystal clear hate bias of someone who says "every member of [x] group is a bad person" and substantiates that thought with internet anecdotes? 
That person has definitely not tried very hard to find good trannies, or any trannies at all. The only trannies he cares about are the ones who give him an excuse to keep hating on them
<comment>
Some things shouldn't be represented, like you.
<comment>
First of all, this "passing" trans thing is idiotic. You have to literally get surgery all over your body, use makeup, and then use camera angles in order to hide it. "what about intersex peopl-" what about them? They are not trans.
As for irl trans, I met two of them, and both left terrible impressions. One of them was a complete asshole for no reason. There was a presentation and the trans kept insulting the presenter. Why?? The other didn't do anything actively malicious, but also literally did not shower and was lazy as fuck. And I know what you're going to say "there are plenty of people who are lazy and don't shower" yeah sure but that doesn't mean they are good people.

I'm not really trans, just not blinded by prejudice. 
I wish you would add yourself to the rotten people list, at least it would show you have some level of self awareness
<comment>
Can you explain to me why the majority of trans are racist? Isn't it kind of hypocritical when they are so sensitive about any trans criticism.
<comment>
he certainly had homosexual proclivities and relations but ultimately i believe he faced enough pressure from family and society to abandon such for the most part

Another time breaking that anon's promise of not bringing it up, but oh well...
I wonder if having a bf who reassures me that nothing bad will happen if I don't do my compulsions would be effective? Or maybe he could do some kind of spell to prevent me from fearing the consequences of not responding to an intrusive thought? Either way, would be interesting to have a sacred thing in the from of a person with whom you can interact; a bastion of purity to keep the filthy thoughts away.
<comment>
I missed you bun. I wish I could help. Is there anything I can do for you? Top from the bottom for a second, direct me on how to direct you.

Kinda really really wish I had a kind loving bf who was slowly gently fucking me missionary rn and I could slide my hands round the back of his neck and pull him in closer so I could kiss him slowly and curl my fingers through his hair while he groans and pants into me

No, just anon. We've talked a few times but honestly I've steered clear of a lasting friendship with you in the past. I'm not sure why. As much as you talk about OCD you seem kinda messy, for lack of a better word. Scatterbrained.
Going back to your 'sacred thing' 'bastion of purity,' I feel like that's a ticking bomb waiting to go off when something inevitably causes your perception of him to become soiled too, undermining not just your attraction but also the dynamic between you.

<comment>
Becoming very bad, or generally having trouble with the few things which I care about. And besides that a huge part of it is my desire to simply not have filthy thoughts while doing cool stuff. Even if I lost all delusions (although self-fulfilling prophecies do exist) of their influence I am still left with the knowledge of them happening. And I really dislike being aware that I just had a bad thought while engaging in a passion of mine.
...sorry :c
A bit paranoid now ngl.
you seem kinda messy
How come?
something inevitably causes your perception of him to become soiled
There is only a handful of things that could do that. And if he were my bf then those would be by definition not of concern. I'm more worried about getting too avoidant and psychopathic on him. But other than that I'd be probably ultra clingy :D
Finally someone else said it!

I forgot, you don't use discord do you? Do you ever move outside of this thread? I want to develop a relationship with you. Let's stop being strangers.
<comment>
I think hat the set of thoughts which I don't wanna have is smaller than the set of those towards which I'm at least ambivalent. I just don't wanna have certain thoughts and nothing more than that. So I don't think that I'm very concerned about having mastery over my all my thoughts, just the bad ones. The thing that differentiates them from neutral or good thoughts is that they feature, or that I associate them with, concepts and/or ideas and/or people who I find vehemently disgusting. And in my experience the pink elephant dilemma only happens when I become aware of an impending action's importance. That action then becomes the prime target for corruption by the thoughts.
Nope, no cords on this end sadly. But I have carried a conversation out of this thread a couple of times, although I usually eventually give up on them... I'd prefer talking here nonny, and if you dislike receiving cringy messages then you better too desu

<comment>
I suppose my question is whether it upsets you more that you have these thoughts at all than the thoughts themselves, but from your response here it doesn't sound like it. Is it then that those thoughts are so powerful that simply having them is enough to send you into an episode? 
Concepts and ideas are very different to people. Are these people whom you have suffered abuse from in the past? What of these concepts and ideas, do they have a particular theme? Sexual, violent, something like that? Is there an example you can divulge?
Does an action's importance have to relate to these negative thoughts in any way, or is it simply that your mind finds tenuous links from these negative thoughts to anything that is taking up a significant portion of your mental space?
Forgive the prying nature of my questions, and of course I'll understand if you aren't comfortable answering them. I just find this interesting.

I think I might like to get some clingy, cringy messages. In private, just between the two of us. It's aok if you would rather keep it in the thread, but I have a lot of trouble keeping it up between threads without any added structure. That's part of why we haven't connected before this. Maybe we can set up a scheduled correspondence?

Getting drunk alone? That's such a waste.

Such as?
<comment>
History should be divided into eras based on Bobby's incarceration status.
there exist a timeline where I don't have OCD
;-;
It all depends on the mood and my general level of misery at the moment, but yes, I have had a good number of times where one thought escalated into an episode of inner lunacy. Luckily those moments seem to have gotten rarer.
Concepts and ideas are very different to people.
Absolutely not (to me at least :3). "People don't matter only what they represent." - Steel Man
The only people who I dislike primarily due to abuse are my parents, everyone else never did me any socially recognized harm (I say this because their ugliness is very much a most grievous form of harm to me). But it all still very much seems to have some sorts of traumatic underpinnings. But think of getting scared by an image, for instance, and not necessarily an event.
The closest that I can get to discerning a theme among the taboo thoughts is by saying that they all have a connection towards things I deem: "rural", "traditional", "right-wing", etc.
And I don't know if I should give an example, I fear that I'm thinking too much about these unpleasant things. I do something and then a visual thought pops up and suddenly the thing I was doing starts feeling "dirty". Metaphysical contamination obsessive-compulsive disorder they call it.
Hmmm what stuff do you enjoy doing anon?
<comment>
sounds like the single lease appealing thing I could do right now.
That's the part where your rationality should take over. It's like taking a bitter medicine. Sure it tastes horrible. But you go through that unpleasant moment so you can reap the benefits in the future. Like hard work first, rewards later. 
Of course the idea of facing your fears isn't appealing. But the real question here is this: do you find the idea of never having a bf appealing? So why are you headed in that direction? 
Be reasonable. Face your fears and the universe will reward you with coming of age experiences

So let me get it right... You basically feel ashamed and self hating for being gay?

I enjoy doing lots of stuff. I go through stages of liking things. Most recently I've been in a /lit-fit/ and style phase that feels very refreshing, but a bit narcissistic.
<comment>
I used to have similar stages when I was younger I think. But now I'm fully one-dimensional! Wanna list a few of them thingies that make you all giddy inside?
/lit.../
O.o w-what is your favorite book anon? And can you please mog me?
<comment>
It's good that things seem to be getting better. I know you annoy me sometimes but you're one of us and you're alright really 
People not mattering really depends on the person, but I see your point here. Were your parents right wing, or is it something else that makes associations with rural trad aesthetic upsetting to you? Or, do you even know what it is? The way your speak about it sounds more like a pattern you've happened to observe than something consciously built, but I could be misreading you.
What about the OCD rituals themselves? I assume you're the anon who used to mention obsessive hand washing. Is it something that calms you, or are you trying to force out negative thoughts? Are you worried that your thoughts will rub off on you if you let them linger?

update
my bath bomb has turned my bath a deep purple
I am bathing in the mana pool
<comment>
you annoy me sometimes
How can I prevent this?
I think that a defining factor in the parthenogenesis of the thoughts happened to be my immediate and greater surroundings in relation to my contrarian mindset. It's like living with the bucharest sewer people for me, so I would heavily expect that if I grew up somewhere less stinky I would have fewer brain problems, or maybe even none at all. So yeah my surrounding is/was full with things that I find disgusting.
I wash my hands because I touch things which I find dirty, if I don't then I feel all yucky. Here's a cool compulsion: I must way for at least an hour before I can move through a space where someone disgusting passed through. It's all about the aesthetics, I'm too sensitive to ugliness.
And yeah, I think I'll stop for now with the OCD inspection. So feel free to change the subject anon.
Is there an issue, genosse?
<comment>
Like i said before Mr Anon. Larping is only cool when I do it. Get outta here.
<comment>
I just like the aesthetic of the GDR I think. It's not my intention to come off as pretending to harbor feelings that go beyond that. But being a State Security agent does seem kinda based uwu.
<comment>
tfw no stasi bf to smuggle me in evil American media (Lynyrd Skynyrd cds)
<comment>
thanks you too bestie
<comment>
Hopefully you can figure out what you're interested in and move into other stuff too, a lot of people get stuck in one or two things their whole lives and never have anything else. 
thingies that make you all giddy inside? 
Cooking, games, backpack trips, writing, not much actually makes me feel happy but some of them are at least fun.
I don't think I have a favorite book, it would be embarrassing to pick just one..
<comment>
But I have already figured it out! It might be all fall under the same academic field, but it's nevertheless pretty diverse! There is nothing else in life for me, and I don't want it to be any different. The only thing that sucks is that my desire to live is directly proportional to the amount of fun that that limited number of subjects generates for me :/
What stuff do you write about anon? What is the current bookie that you are reading?
backpack trips
School is kinda lame imo
<comment>
eat frozen taquitos
stomach now hurts like a bitch
Ok from this day on I will ABSTAIN from GOYSLOP
<comment>
The monitor isn't even showing anything!
<comment>
Ok now i just feel sad and hopeless again. I don't want to live anymore. But at least gaming was fun :(
<comment>
you're supposed to reheat them first silly
<comment>
admiring hands in the HAND RATE thread
someone starts posting about their bf and how much they love him
gonna reeeeee to be quite honest with you
<comment>
Well, it's also very fortunate for you to clearly know what you're interested in and what your reason for living is. Most people don't have one of those, or it's something lame like family. Can I ask what yours is, or is that a secret?
I just write whatever, poems and short stories mostly. I have a few books outlined that I don't want to write because I know I won't be happy with the product. I wouldn't consider myself a writer (never published) so please don't have high expectations there. I just like to be creative
<comment>
Once again calling for a global genocide of all bf Havers
<comment>
It is not a secret, but I'm afraid it will have to wait until the next thread to be revealed. I spoke about the OCD in this one and therefore it feels a bit dirty, and I don't want to dirty my life's passions.
Being creative is cool anon, keep at it! What kind of books do your like to read? I mean genre-wise. Wish that I was as high-functioning as you are desu
<comment>
Sorry that you feel that way. The only thing there is to say: every silver lining's got a touch of grey.
<comment>
I think I know what it is anyway, at least sort of. Not something I have much knowledge of or interest in at the moment though. I'm still working on the grapes of wrath, it's fairly dry reading since it's set in the dust bowl. I just sit and play with my phone when I should be reading a lot of the time, haha. I could use a couple of suggestions for books to alternate with if you want to tell me what your favorite book is too.
Wish that I was as high-functioning as you are desu
Do you think that having someone to hold you accountable would help? A little structure and discipline might be the motivation you need.

<comment>
Should I go out with my friends and have some fun or should I stay inside and shitpost all night long? 
I feel like I'm at a crossroads between the way of the normal and the way of the incel
<comment>
Going out with friends is usually the more boring choice, but you should still do it sometimes to maintain the relationship and keep it as an option. If you don't go you stop having a choice.
<comment>
Start hanging out with coworkers 
Going out drinking with them for the first time
Boss looks me dead in the eye with this pissed off expression on my first drink about how if he has to babysit me we're not doing this again
Coworkers start making "jokes" about going to places without me 
Realize I'm like on the very bottom of the totem poll and when I've been laughing with these guys they've been laughing at me and not with me
Barely speak for the rest of the night and just internally seethe
eventually one of our other coworker's invites like 15 more people
Crowd too big for comfort now
Stumble my way home

you should kill all of them desu

should I go to sleep or stay up and finish off my vodka
<comment>
I don't blame you it practically screams "boring", and I would find it that way too were it not for me building my entire identity around it.
But with all due respect anon, even that doesn't compare with the boredom that your novel emanates. Like seriously, you chose what has to be the most lifeless period in US history and then couple it together with the most dry literary approach out there?! That's at least what impression I get from it, and therefore will likely never proceed to actually read it. What made you choose it out of all the alternate stuff that you could instead dive into? Is the gleam of the Nobel prize that blinded you into this?
I for one don't read story books at all. So if you were looking for that kind of recommendation I'm afraid I'm at a loss, because the only story books I've read were the ones featured in my school curriculum. I also don't currently read any other types of books either, so I cannot say what my favorite book is because I haven't read it yet. But I do have a bunch of them that I undoubtedly will get around to reading, just not now. My current surroundings would be far too distracting for such a task.
haha
Hmm, a lack of femininity. I like it!
having someone to hold you accountable
o.o ...It seems that we really did talk before huh? I-I would certainly hope that someone like that would help me out. *sigh* What I'd give for a boy to discipline me.
<comment>
If you guys could have suitors who would it be? Mine would be:
King George V
Tsar Nicholas Romanov II
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
Naser al-Din Shah Qajar
Wasfi Tal
Saddam Hussein
Gamal Abdel Nasser
Andrea Giambruno
Emomali Rahmon

desu the only boy I want is the fictional one I have created entirely within my own mind
<comment>
EXTRA SPICY
<comment>
I think I am depressed or something
I legitmately cannot be bothered to do anything but look at 4chan all day and listen to music
<comment>
Oh I almost forgot about Peter Romanov! But those are my suitors. And they all care for me.
<comment>
You forgot Gaddafi dude
<comment>
I'd like for tommyinnit to be my suitor
Very likely. What parts of 4chan do you look at anon? And also *kiss*
<comment>
this but instead of music it's shitty youtube videos
<comment>
You can have him, but he looked nice when younger.
<comment>
Bashar Al Assad
<comment>
Same. Wish i had more interesting things to post though.
<comment>
He hates zoomers
<comment>
I resent them because I'm old, is that what you wanted to hear
<comment>
I did it... i thought of a gimmick but i'm not sure it is original at all, probably not. It sounds fun but i will need to figure out the details mwahahaha
<comment>
Yes and you have to hate something
<comment>
Oh shush it's not that bad, and it's an interesting period exactly because it's less popular to write about! There's a lot of very charming takes on freedom and independence from 18-19th century american lit. Idk. There are moving parts to the story and I can tell that it's drawing towards a meaningful conclusion, and to me that's a big part of the fun of reading. It's not just a story about a farm it's a commentary on capitalism and industrialization, or something. Actually that's probably missing the point pretty badly, again I haven't finished it.

I hope you fall in a deep pit and break both of your legs

happy birthday, anon

niggas really out here at 25 years old still saying "^_^"

remember the /r9gay/ #1800 thread.
sweet
<comment>
niggas really out here at 25 years old still no job
<comment>
sounds based
getting a job is for fags
<comment>
I don't get it though. If you want a commentary on capitalism and industrialization go read Fisher or something. If you want a compelling story go watch some indie film. Why settle for the worst of both worlds?
shush
:3
you think you could keep it together and not get discouraged
Probably not :D But I wouldn't really have a choice, right?
<comment>
BASED!!!!
yep totally is
<comment>
I made your new thread, Friends.

If you say so.
<comment>
thats what is unless you're in a career field which you extremely enjoy
I'm sorry but working as an electrian for 60 years or working in an office for 60 years does not seem very fun
nearly everyone would not work if they didn't have to
you're not being edgy nor contrarian to love work
you are just being stupid
<comment>
Maybe find that kind of work you like to do?
<comment>
No sorry I can't do that....it's too much work...sigh...
<comment>
I am so sorry.
kisses you mwah mwah

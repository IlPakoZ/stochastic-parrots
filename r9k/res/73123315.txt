if you are 30+ and never had a gf etc, would a gf solve all your problems / depression? or would it not change much?

I think it might help. It's nice to have someone to confide in and someone with you. To share joys with. But also being alone so long would make it quite a change. I'd have to be considerate of her.

My problem is that I want a family and don't even have a girlfriend, so it's safe to assume the right girlfriend would solve that problem. Otherwise I've got my shit together.

I'm 25 and I've had three short-term (&lt; 3 months) relationships. I promise women will not fix you.

It wouldn't solve all my problems but it would boost my self esteem significantly.

No, need to get buff and a larger penis before getting a femboy gf.

if the girl actually, genuinely loved me then yes, that's literally all i need and my only goal, i already have everything else

Depends on the time of year. A GF isnt necessary for most of it, but it would be nice to have one during the harder months where the loneliness hits like a truck.

I was 31 when I got my first gf. It only lasted a few months, but it solved all my problems and saved my life.
before having a gf
"I suck, I'm worthless, nobody will ever like me, nobody will miss me when I'm gone, the world is a dark and bleak and hopeless place."
after having a gf
"She wasn't the right one for me, but that's okay. People can like me, because I'm not so bad after all. Life can be good, and we're all gonna make it."

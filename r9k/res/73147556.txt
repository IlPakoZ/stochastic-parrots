listen nigger, it's simple. VIRGIN INERTIA. AND YOU NEED TO BREAK IT.
ofc it is going to be uncomfortable and awkward. even a chad like me sometimes feels out of place. 
don't feel so defeated. just keep trying until you feel casual.

you need to spend time with people while collaborating on something or competing with them. if you play a sport or some game or if you have some artistic passion you can find a group of people to do those things with. if you lack passion of any kind then it is over for you and you should accept that your only joy will come from wasting away in front of your computer screen.

I've tried so so many times throughout the years and everytime when I got comfortable, something went wrong. 
I know that it was partially because I grew up at the wrong place with the wrong people, but there's also component of my personality too. Now I want to start all over again, but it's so hard if you lack experience and what experience you have, is negative. Its like getting rid of fear of heights even after you broke your legs from a fall as a kid.

i understand your struggle and analogy. it's extra tough for some guys out there, including you from what you've told me. 
but it's so hard if you lack experience and what experience you have, is negative.
there's no bigger truth man. 
I was at this big house party. I met a random hot slut there and started to flirt with her. she reciprocated equally, even initiated more than I did. at one point, a boyfriend that I wasn't aware of comes to us. leads me out together with her. I've never been aggressive, I wasn't brought up like that, nor is it my natural state and way of thinking. I went diplomatic with that guy and that's where i fucked up. I was sucker punched. lost control completely. eventually, I fell to the ground and lost consciousness from the heavy beatings. I found myself in the hospital with a couple of missing teeth, a broken nose, a bloodshot eye, and ~10 bruises on my head and ribs. after that incident, I didn't go out or try to hook up with girls for a long time. I was so traumatized that I changed drastically and I'm not the same person I was. I was much more relaxed, cheerful, and naive.
i usually tell people to "fight it", whatever it is. because usually, it is worth it. there's a fantastic saying from prominent American military leader douglas Macarthur and it goes: 
age wrinkles the body; quitting wrinkles the soul

I am tired of my life. I wish I was happy. Yet the problem is I don't know what would make me happy. At this point I am not even sure getting a gf would make me happy. It might but I just don't know anymore. Same goes with having friends to talk to... Would that make me happy so I don't feel so alone? Once again I do not know. Never really had a chance recently to figure that out. I am tired of this life because I do not know what to do with it and not knowing what will make me happy is truly hellish. At least if I had a goal I could go for it I could have a chance of being happy but I am just stuck in this hell. Don't even know why I am saying all this when most people here won't care. Just needed to vent.
We are strugglers anon, made to suffer for a short while until we pass
Yeah I know... I am just so tired and the inability to try and change it just makes it worse.
Go watch fight club or some shit jesus christ

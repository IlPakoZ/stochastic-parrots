You guys ever read comic books?
Does ready steel ball run count?
*reading 
I can't type
Not as much as I use to, I'd go to the comic book store at least once a week and pick up the latest issue a few years ago. I'll sometimes read a graphic novel if I have it or online sites (in most cases), I read manga more though
Yes. I like Grant Morrison's stuff and a lot of the early 90s Vertigo comics. I also like the new Riddler: Year One comic.
Yes but only creator-owned comics nowadays.
No, they're like this unsatisfying middle ground between reading a book and looking at art.
I typically read older shit pre-2010ish aside from a handful of things. Red Room is a pretty good modern comic

My father is a heroin addict. I think I will carry on the family tradition. Unfortunately I am not an extraverted chad like he is.

Do they know you use/plan to use?
<comment>
I don't know my dad. My mom doesn't know about my habit and I definitely won't tell her.

What's her position on your dad using?
<comment>
Opposed to it, I would think, but she may not care anymore. They split up pretty soon after I was born. But she saw him on the streets a few years ago. Still using, now homeless.

Are you in the US? Have fun with your "heroin" (fent laced with xylazine)

Damn that's sad. Aren't you afraid that you might be homeless as well?

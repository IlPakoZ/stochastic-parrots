My father is a heroin addict. I think I will carry on the family tradition. Unfortunately I am not an extraverted chad like he is.
Do they know you use/plan to use?
I don't know my dad. My mom doesn't know about my habit and I definitely won't tell her.
What's her position on your dad using?
Opposed to it, I would think, but she may not care anymore. They split up pretty soon after I was born. But she saw him on the streets a few years ago. Still using, now homeless.
Are you in the US? Have fun with your "heroin" (fent laced with xylazine)
Damn that's sad. Aren't you afraid that you might be homeless as well?

Trust me, it still feels like meth. Only the effects of meth coincidentally counteract a lot of the effects of ADHD.
Trust me, Adderaal is super helpful with getting shit done. I'm super grateful to have it. Just no matter what anyone tells you, DO NOT take it every day. Your entire social life will implode on itself.

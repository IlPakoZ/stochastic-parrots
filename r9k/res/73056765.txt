Trust me, Adderaal is super helpful with getting shit done. I'm super grateful to have it. Just no matter what anyone tells you, DO NOT take it every day. Your entire social life will implode on itself.
tried adderall once or twice and i felt like shit. everything felt so slow, normie reaction times, brain fog, and i wasn't able to hyperfocus at all. it kinda took the me out of me
although i've heard better things about vyvanse and non-stim meds

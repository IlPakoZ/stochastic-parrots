awake for 10 minutes and already starting to cry
Any other robots cry? Why do you cry?
I don't know why I cry but I probably will 4 more times today.
i cry seldomly, and its usually to come unbearable idea or pain or feelings of intense jealousy
the thought of never getting love sometimes gets me down so hard i cry
i listened to this asmr girl i like sing a love song from ff8, and i cried, out of nowhere, because ill never have her
the idea that god will abuse me again and i deserve it makes me cry
sometimes, very rarely, i cry because music is so beautiful
i think more frequent cryers have lower thresholds, crying when they're less distressed than less frequent cryers. does that line up with your experience?

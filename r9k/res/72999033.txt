I'm jealous of how intimate and emotionally vulnerable women are with each other. Every guy friend I've had has been fun to hang out/do stuff with, but that's all I can say. Girl friendships seem so comfy.
Guy friendships do be like that
Lesbians have the highest rates of domestic abuse though. There's a reason lesbian bed death is a thing.
I've cried in front of my closest male friends and they've cried in front of me. I've talked one out of being suicidal and he's put me up when i was homeless. Get better friends bro
Either get a girl friend you can vent to, look for other friends, or try to have a one-on-one deep conversation with a friend that can understand your struggles.
Men only comfort each other outside of social groups. From my experience.
he said friendships illiterate nigger most women arent lesbian
not really
women can be super nasty with each other too
i just prefer people im comfortable around and don't judge me on everything i do/say
I've got a couple of guy friendships that are pretty close. They're kino. It's good to have someone I can talk to about legit anything.
Even my wife gets a little jealous about how close we are.
I have that with other guys and some trannies online.
I don't care what you said but that ass is absolutely BUILT FOR BBC
that sounds gay shit bro
It depends on the person. I am still able to contact my ex and we remained friends after everything. We can pretty much confide about anything to each other. I can't expect the same from my male friends, except for one. But he's a special case.
Women with each other aren't as close as you might think, however. It usually depends on whether they are a childhood friend (being bitchy and yet truthful to each other) or a 'recent' friend (everything is fine and it's all surface level).

I'm scared of women /r9k/.
Why are they so emotionally penetrating?
They notice every tiny mistake you make and they are EXTREMELY manipulative and constantly do tests and other crap and they are also materialistic and greedy as fuck. Also they can easily ruin your entire life if they want to.
Nothing scares me more than women.

I probably have some metal issue, but I was emotionally abusive to and ruined my ex. I wanted to get it out of my system and see just how far I could push him. Im in a healthy relationship now tho.

You get to penetrate physically, we get to penetrate emotionally, its only fair

Well yeah makeup usually makes people look nicer unless you're from britain or ireland in which case it somehow makes things worse which is truly remarkable when you consider that the ugliest people to ever exist in the entire history humanity from the time when we left Africa to now.

Makeup can be nice. Like probably most men I used to dislike it in principle because of the egregious trashy examples I've seen, but if done with good taste it can look cute, even if it's more exaggerated or obvious.
I like very obvious red or pink blush (bronze looks trashy for some reason), and those drawn-on curved black lines extending from the side of the eye that suggest longer eyelashes or whatever, it makes a girl look more like an anime character. If I knew more about makeup I'd make specific comments.

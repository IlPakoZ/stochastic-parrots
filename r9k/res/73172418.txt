Why do women think a guy being nice/good is what makes him a good/nice person?
this is a serious question
<comment>
I don't think you know anything about what women think
<comment>
Something tells me you're dealing with young women (like 20s or something) aren't yet mature enough to understand this.
<comment>
Are you saying men will just act nice to get sex from women? Thats true for some men but not all.
<comment>
I mean, you're both incels. So that's a given.
<comment>
Are you saying men will just act nice to get sex from women?
More like abusers and terrible people can still do nice/good things (and in fact do them all the time), but it's still not enough to reverse all the other shit they do. Which is a recurring blindspot for women.
Thats true for some men but not all.
These behaviours are still ubiquitous to the male gender much like rape and other violences are.

What the fuck does this mean? And why does everyone hate on nice/good people? I've literally always been naturally altruistic and empathetic as fuck even though I probably shouldn't have, and I've had even normalfags who are the most liberal faggots in the world talk shit about me for it. Why are you people like this? Why can't women just say they don't like people who are manipulative? This shit confused me for the longest time (I'm not very smart. Can't have it all I suppose, though I'm losing what little personality I have too now)
<comment>
I don't understand where you are going with this.
What are you actually trying to imply?
<comment>
And why does everyone hate on nice/good people?
Because "good" and "nice" are one the most subjective concepts known to man, and comes down to what people feel (not think) is good and nice, not if it's actually good and nice.
Why can't women just say they don't like people who are manipulative?
They do. But whether they walk the walk instead of just talking the talk is another matter. And anyone who's good at manipulation is going to good at hiding it, and making themselves appear like a good, nice person.
<comment>
he's directly expressing a point, anon. not implying anything. why would you think that?
<comment>
Women aren't mind readers and in the vast majority of cases behavior is a demonstration of character.
Your question is fucking dumb.
<comment>
he's directly expressing a point
Which is?
<comment>
there's no such thing as a good woman. having behaviours that make you genetically imposed to make yourself look safe around is not good.
Men created the concept of good morality so those who follow it are good even if "most" men don't like you believe.
<comment>
Which is?
Why do women think a guy being nice/good is what makes him a good/nice person?
learn fucking english.
<comment>
no, behaviours are demonstrations of individual behaviours. character (like behaviour) is too easy to fake the majority of the time.
<comment>
That isn't directly expressing a point dumbass. It's implying one through using a begging question.
<comment>
Women literally think the opposite. If you aren't a huge asshole they just think you are a huge asshole in secret. They can not comprehend the idea that there are just genuinely kind people in the world.
<comment>
That isn't directly expressing a point dumbass.
it is, autismo. it's quite explicit and word-for-word, and even an esl like you shouldn't have this much problem with it.
It's implying one
there is no implications.
through using a begging question
where's your proof?
<comment>
That's not what implications are, Anon.
<comment>
as a girl, ive never thought a nice guy was a good person until i got to know them personally !! :3
<comment>
By that standard all humans are unknowable black boxes since there is nothing that gives the absolute certainty that you seem to be looking for.
If you think actions can be taken as a means to judge a person, and words can't ether, then by your own standards it is literally impossible to judge if a person is good or not since there is the possibility they could do something bad in the future.
I guess the only good people in your world view would be dead people who lived lives of doing nothing you find objectionable.
<comment>
It isn't retard.
But you are far too stupid to realize it.
It isn't making a statement. It instead is implying one.
<comment>
Because women want pity and men who give it are nice and kind to those who are lesser beings. And when this happens those same men do start to turn against eachother. Next step is that those men are seen as bullies who actually are only kind and nice to the lesser beings (bullying others by being weak coward). They hate, pity and seek revenge because no one believes their lies.
<comment>
And why does everyone hate on nice/good people?
Most people who call themselves "nice/good people" are actual manipualtors or delusionnal assholes. You shouldn't say you're "nice" if that's not a compliment you're actively and routinely receiving by all others around you, at least.
<comment>
there is nothing that gives the absolute certainty
there isn't.
If you think actions can be taken as a means to judge a person
they aren't. they're the easiest to fake or misinterpret.
<comment>
Women want a guy who looks good or nice.
Character is far less relevant than people give credit for.
<comment>
It isn't retard.
where's your proof?
It instead is implying one
where's? your? proof? which you conveniently ignored the last time.
<comment>
Again, that's not at all what implications are.
<comment>
Most people who call themselves "nice/good people" are actual manipualtors or delusionnal assholes
That isn't even remotely true.
Even as someone with trust issues who literally trust no one, probably because of that now that I think about it, I have directly and indirectly observed that the vast majority of people who behave nice/good do so genuinely and not as a manipulation tactic.
It's within most people's self interest to behave in a pro-social manner rather than expend the effort required to play some sort of long con manipulation as their whole personality.
Such manipulators are generally rare.
Then again I strongly suspect you aren't being sincere and just playing a character to amuse yourself and demoralize others.
<comment>
Are you just pretending to be retarded or are you actually retarded?
<comment>
they're the easiest to fake or misinterpret.
That's flat out wrong.
Words are easiest to fake and misinterpret.
Actions are reality. The proof in the pudding.
If someone does a good thing they did a good thing.
If they consistently do good things they are a good person.
The only way to fake doing a good thing is to not actually do the good thing but make people believe you did the good thing that you didn't do.
A person literally is what they do from a outside perspective. A person who does good is good. It's the reason dogooder and evildoer are both terms.
<comment>
Actions are...
... way more conscious and deliberate than words. same for body language and other non-verbal cues.
If someone does a good thing they did a good thing.
If they consistently do good things they are a good person.
not one of these are true, and terrible men (and it's usually men who are guilty this) pull these off all the time.
The only way to fake doing a good thing is to not actually do the good thing but make people believe you did the good thing that you didn't do.
A person literally is what they do from a outside perspective. A person who does good is good. It's the reason dogooder and evildoer are both terms.
your english broke down in these last two statements.
<comment>
Are you just pretending to be retarded or are you actually retarded?
If you want to talk logic, this is the pot calling the kettle black.
<comment>
If one explicitly states they are nice, something is off because that should be evident through their actions.
It's true that most people who act nice don't do it for manipulative reasons, but it is still tied with self-interest.
If anything, being nice to people is nothing special. There are a number of other factors that outweight niceness in terms of value to other people.
<comment>
Lol, god no. Actions are the least reliable indicator, because those are fully conscious functions, hence way easier (and more effective) to be deceptive with than words alone.
It's the typically consistency of one's character that defines them. But even that isn't remotely accurate, as sociopaths and abusers fake those all the time (and consistency is also an easy thing manipulate).
At best, you can only make educated guesses with these.
<comment>
Because if he acts like that all the time and shows his ability to manage anger he is probably a good/nice person? Everyone is potentially dangerous but unless she is a "I can fix him" type of girl, it's better to go with someone reasonable.
<comment>
Because if he acts like that all the time and shows his ability to manage anger he is probably a good/nice person?
no, even that isn't always enough to make him a good or nice, and guys who aren't are still good at what you just described.
<comment>
What I said was put as simply and humanity possible.
There was no break down of English.
Also you have no reasonable rebuttal.
You just insist that men are just bad no matter what without actually supporting your argument. And to say that actions are less of a valid way to judge a person then words is quite frankly stupid.
I suspect you don't even believe the nonsense you are putting forward at this point.
<comment>
What I said was put as simply and humanity possible.
and you're still wrong.
There was no break down of English.
this sentence alone breaks down by the end of it.
Also you have no reasonable rebuttal.
this is that pot calling the kettle black the others were referring to
You just insist that men are just bad no matter what
no one explicitly said this.
And to say that actions are less of a valid way to judge a person
they are.
<comment>
If one explicitly states they are nice, something is off because that should be evident through their actions
That is unreasonable to automatically assume if someone describes themselves as a good person that they are bad.
How exactly do you expect someone to describe or view themselves? As low worth worms? As unapologetic assholes? Is that the only kind of people you think is keeping it real?
but it is still tied with self-interest.
You say that like it means anything. Even saints are 100% selfless. Being totally selfless is actually a really bad thing in most situations.
If anything, being nice to people is nothing special
You have to have lived a extremely fortunate life lacking hardship to not see value in it.
There are a number of other factors that outweight niceness in terms of value to other people
That still doesn't mean it's a bad thing or automatically a manipulative ploy that makes someone really a bad person.
<comment>
It's a certainty that you are a troll.
<comment>
How exactly do you expect someone to describe or view themselves?
By not describing themselves. These things work by show-don't-tell logic.
<comment>
no, you're just wrong, and with an incel's idea of how people work.
<comment>
So you think that even in context that demand someone describes themselves they shouldn't and if they do that is a red flag?
Again that is unreasonable.
<comment>
So you think that even in context that demand someone describes themselves they shouldn't and if they do that is a red flag?
That's a strangely specific example you're choosing (ironically out of context). And even in those instances, that can still be a red-flag or reason to doubt them.
Again that is unreasonable.
That's literally how socialising works.

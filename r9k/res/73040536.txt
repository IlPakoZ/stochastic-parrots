This game still exists?
I use to play a couple years ago but stopped because of all the crashers/modders who fucking ruined the game.
<comment>
Mods get you banned now, they added anti cheat
I have like 300 hours and only got crashed once even tho i always have the shield off. If you are worried about crashers just set your shield level to prevent that

Same, fren. I'm trying to abandon this things too, tomorrow I will continue working out. I must overcome my weaknesses.
Yeah, you're on the right track to happiness. Once you're finally strong enough, then you'll be satisfied with life.

BRIGHT LIGHTS ON A STARLESS NIGHT
BURN A HOLE IN THE DYING DAY

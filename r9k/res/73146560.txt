I have hundreds of Reddit accounts aged over years.
I haven't done this. But if I wanted. I could promote anything I wanted.
Worth zero dollars because selling the accounts could risk legal trouble I bet. 
Scared using stylometric analysis people could match my Subreddits and writing style down to figure out they're all me and get doxxed
Don't be so smug all of you use reddit too
What Reddit secrets can't you admit on reddit?
i have literally never used reddit
the layout looks so shit to me i dont think i could ever actually get into it
I used 4chan before reddit. Been on here since 2015 and only started going there and created an account in 2019,
mostly for coomer/porn subreddits

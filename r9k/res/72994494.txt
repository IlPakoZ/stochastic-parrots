hello :) who is your favorite composer?
<comment>
Chopin. All of his pieces are just amazing and the more I listen to them and play them the more Iove them. I've only been playing for 3 1/2 years though so I maybe at some point I'll learn to appreciate other composers as much as him. I think after I'm done with Etude Op. 10 No. 3 I'll try some Beethoven Sonatas

Sounds cool as fuck. I started even later. About 3 1/2 years ago I spontaneously bought an e-piano and started taking lessons because I thought it would be a better investment than spending my money on stuff like video games. Instantly fell in love with it and been practicing pretty much daily ever since. Add me on Discord if you want to, pretty sure I'm gonna go to sleep soon since it's 2:30am over here, my fc is #9915

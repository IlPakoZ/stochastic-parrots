don't worry anon. perhaps she hasn't been born yet. good things come to those who wait
hello :) who is your favorite composer?
Chopin. All of his pieces are just amazing and the more I listen to them and play them the more Iove them. I've only been playing for 3 1/2 years though so I maybe at some point I'll learn to appreciate other composers as much as him. I think after I'm done with Etude Op. 10 No. 3 I'll try some Beethoven Sonatas
god no way youre perfect, when i went to france i visited chopins grave, my favorite is heroic polonaise op 53, so lovely..
Also a very nice piece, I really gotta listen it some more. How long have you been playing piano for? Or do you play another instrument?
ive been playing since i was 10. (i now, i started pretty late.)
i play a handful of string instruments and i make music too haha :P
how about you? how long have you been playing anon
Sounds cool as fuck. I started even later. About 3 1/2 years ago I spontaneously bought an e-piano and started taking lessons because I thought it would be a better investment than spending my money on stuff like video games. Instantly fell in love with it and been practicing pretty much daily ever since. Add me on Discord if you want to, pretty sure I'm gonna go to sleep soon since it's 2:30am over here, my fc is #9915
ah tag doesnt work..
It's the right one, guess you need the name too though

I would like to have sex
I want to live in a monastery.
you can do this anytime. fair warning though, any place that is "chaste" is just a bunch of gay dudes having sex with each other. that what monasteries were invented for and remain to this day.
I'm not too fond of femails
computers are better friends than people
You say that but refuse to talk to women
You all cant get gf because bad personality not because overarching microplastic jewish conspiracy
:(
how do I fix bad personality
I think that people should be more careful and considerate
Posting text to the internet should be a privilege, not just something a dimwit can do by shouting at his cheap phone.
Most people are ruled by their desires whether it be tv shows/movies, video games, food, sex, random hobbies etc, porn, gym, etc.
People are addicted to doings random useless things because it gives them dopamine surge and cannot live without it, they cannot just "enjoy" life.

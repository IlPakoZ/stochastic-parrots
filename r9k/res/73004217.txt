He's cheating on you with multiple different women, femanon. He secretly hates you and you know it deep down. He doesn't pay enough attention to you. You know how sometimes you text him and it can take a long time, even hours, for him to get back to you? That's because he's fucking other girls. 
You may have noticed he changed after a few weeks of being with him. It used to be a total honeymoon, and now there's something different. That's because he got tired of you. This post is his way of breaking up with you without him seeming like the bad guy because it will not be "his fault."
Your fears are valid. Break up with this toxic, abusive asshole and find someone else.

I could tell you have Borderline Personality Disorder and I was going for the delusions that always set my ex off. Your relationship will not last forever, you will eventually go crazy and he will hopefully get away

If you don't want to destroy the relationship then 
1. Get a therapist
2. Do not lie to the therapist
3. Acknowledge that your delusions are YOUR problem and not his
4. Arrange an open relationship because we both know you are currently/are going to cheat on him eventually

She's currently distracted looking at innie pussies, and trying to trap me into telling her she needs to have a barbie pussy. But while she's doing that, tell me about the relationship you had with the BPD girl, where'd ya'lls meet? thanks homie.

On /b/. It was a wonderful long distance relationship for the first few weeks until her delusions got the better of her. We descended from a honeymoon phase where I literally bought a round trip ticket to Mexico after knowing her two weeks, to her accusing me of cheating on her multiple times a day and her interrogating and emotionally torturing me until I confessed to her imaginary cheating. 
After I escaped her abuse I went to r/BPDlovedones and I realized she wasn't as unique as I thought she was. The first reaction most people have to finding that subreddit is "did we all date the same insane woman?" BPD girls are all cookie cutter patterns man. Everything she does is the same as every other BPD woman before her. 
You've seen the red flags, and you have convinced yourself that she is the exception. I know you have because that is what we all do.

I was going to have a job, I had a car, I was on my last legs and I crashed the car, I have no way of making money or getting a new car, the insurance company fucked me in my lowest moment, my comeback moment; I felt happy for a bit there. Like I really had a chance for a second there
what the fuck is the point of any of this fucking bullshit, I was just as happy in that grassy field looking at the sky as I was here; I was just colder out there, really what is the fucking point of any of this?

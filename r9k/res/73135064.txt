finland :D
What part of Skyrim is the closest to resemble Finland?
Why do they have a t on the flag
FINLAND!!! i love Finland 
greetings from Poland :D
It's the Christian cross.
They are all trannies
My femanon friend lives here. I wish I could visit one day.
your finnish femanon friend probably isn't
she is because we voice chat and I've seen pics
and have those photos had a timestamp?
No but some have been related to things she's talking about
such as?
because if she said "my scar\bruise hurts" and then sent you a photo of her scar - she very well may have shown you somebody else's photograph
No it wasn't that. Why are you so interested anyway?
I'm bored, getting drunk and got nothing better to do
I'm also trying to figure out if you've been deceived or if I'm just being paranoid
but how do we know that for sure?
can you look at your reflection in the mirror and honestly, without any shadow of a doubt say "this was indeed a femanon. she is definitely finnish. she really does consider me her friend, even though we've never met in person"
do you even know her name?
Fair enough. Same here except I am teetotal so I'm not drunk. I am 99% sure i'm not being deceived but I never say 100% for anything. I don't think you're paranoid but just jaded and trying to bring me down like so many others. I know her name but don't want to reveal too much else because she uses this board (it's how we met). We aren't dating, she is just a friend and honestly a relationship with her probably would not work. I just think she is a fun person to hang with.
I know what you are faggot
I'm interested because I have a finnish femanon girl?friend and I'm worried shes not actually any of those things.
OMG IT MIGHT BE THE SAME PERSON. 
SHARE MORE ABOUT HER

My femanon friend lives here. I wish I could visit one day.
<comment>
your finnish femanon friend probably isn't
<comment>
she is because we voice chat and I've seen pics
<comment>
and have those photos had a timestamp?
<comment>
No but some have been related to things she's talking about
<comment>
such as?
because if she said "my scar\bruise hurts" and then sent you a photo of her scar - she very well may have shown you somebody else's photograph
<comment>
No it wasn't that. Why are you so interested anyway?
<comment>
I'm bored, getting drunk and got nothing better to do
I'm also trying to figure out if you've been deceived or if I'm just being paranoid
inb4 you're just being paranoid
but how do we know that for sure?
can you look at your reflection in the mirror and honestly, without any shadow of a doubt say "this was indeed a femanon. she is definitely finnish. she really does consider me her friend, even though we've never met in person"
do you even know her name?
<comment>
Fair enough. Same here except I am teetotal so I'm not drunk. I am 99% sure i'm not being deceived but I never say 100% for anything. I don't think you're paranoid but just jaded and trying to bring me down like so many others. I know her name but don't want to reveal too much else because she uses this board (it's how we met). We aren't dating, she is just a friend and honestly a relationship with her probably would not work. I just think she is a fun person to hang with.

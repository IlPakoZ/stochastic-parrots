close all nuclear power plants because radiation is scary
invest in solar and wind
solar and wind fail to deliver 
start buying Russian gas
war in Ukraine starts
can't buy Russian gas anymore
start investing in coal which produces 100s of times more radiation then nuclear power
Why are Germans so fucking retarded?

green stuff is never about the environment, it's about gutting what little industry the west has left and lowering quality of life for white people.
<comment>
why wasn't wind and solar delivering?

Yes it is
it's about gutting what little industry the west has left and lowering quality of life for white people.
Oh you're a delusional conspiracy theorist, nvm

Why do countries do this? It's not the 50s anymore. Nuclear power plants don't even use "messy" radioactive elements like uranium anymore. Modern nuclear power plants are cleaner, safer, and more productive than any other way of generating energy, but nobody invests in it because they all have ptsd from the 50s or something.
<comment>
Why do countries do this
Planned demolition of society.
<comment>
Germany used to have several nuclear power plants, but after fukashima they closed and demolished them. Supposedly due to people being concerned about accidental radiation releases. Wind and solar were supposed to pick up the slack, but they didn't.
<comment>
but they didn't.
Is there a specific reason?
<comment>
Because it wasn't effective enough to power a nation
<comment>
It's probably a lot more complicated but here's one of the more obvious reasons.
<comment>
and demolished them
Pff! 
That will go on for decades yet, and likely cost more than all of the pointless magic panels straight outta chink production our glorious leaders plan on. 
Oh, and good luck with storing the remains, wonder which nog hole we'll end up shipping our nice glowy trash in the end

Fukushima was caused by a failure in the power plant's emergency system during an earthquake and a tsunami. Last I checked, magnitude 9 earthquakes and tsunamis aren't regular occurrences in Germany.
<comment>
I mean yea it's germany what did you expect? For sone reason we still have to make up for the nazis and be a "good" and progressive country
<comment>
That doesn't stop reactionary retards from screaming bloody murder about how their nuclear power plants could literally be the next fukushima/three mile/chernobyl
<comment>
Not to mention no one died in the meltdown, if Fukushima was a coal power plant there would have been a death count
<comment>
unironically this.
they're so progressive since anything that even resembles authority gets people to lift and eyebrow and all but call you the funny mustache man.
Merkel had some semblance of control, and Scholz has some leeway with the war to take the reins.
still, you can see shit like Poland wanting reparations and basically trying to shame Germany into doing stuff.
<comment>
Yea and it doesn't stop. Not my fault the nazis fucked shit up why do i need to pay shit to other countries and let so many people come to us from ukrain? Like can't other countries take them too (no hate to them but please go to other countries too)
<comment>
Sounds like a you problem whitey
<comment>
Not my fault
Yes it is: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/21/study-of-holocaust-survivors-finds-trauma-passed-on-to-childrens-genes

be glad you're not france or something like it.
people immigrating to germany are often atleast decently civil.

Lamarck was right all along
Darwinchuds btfo
<comment>
Dude they basically get free gibs for coming in, no questions asked since PUBLIC CONSENSUS.
Which is one fuck-strange way for the gov office to handle this, since you know.. were their soldier-age males not forbidden to leave our highly-estimed new ally?
Afaik some of more crafty Ukis drive in, get money, go back to fighting at the front. 
All is fair in war and so on.
<comment>
It seems contradictory to be progressive but then reject better forms of power generation for dirty unsafe coal
<comment>
On the other hand I welcome our incoming cannabis clubs! Still no fucking clue where said clubs are supposed to get it from, but guess I'll just haul in some plants from zandvoort with my bros asap
<comment>
My guy it's not my fault the nazis did fucked up shit and I'm sick and tired of that. Can we leave the past behind us instead of always bringing it up? 
Was born and raised here in germany french people are always called rude and assholes here
<comment>
this shit produces little to no fucking power at all, wind is considered a meme by some due to how weak it is, solar is alright tho but again, pretty sure you're never getting as much power per square foot of land compared to nuclear, so you'd have to cover everything in solar panels
<comment>
They are stupid here germany is so wired in that aspect doesn't make sense also they wanted to limit how fast you can go on the autobahn
<comment>
The rejection of nuclear power is one of the greatest tragedies of the later half of the 20th century. Irrefutable proof that our corporate overlords and "elected" politicians care more about money than anything else.
<comment>
Solar doesn't provide very much energy at night time. Wind doesn't produce much power when the winds not blowing. Nuclear is clean and cheap but greatly improves the lives of others so obviously the left absolutely hates it. They literally ban safe wanted disposal just to be able to point at the unsafe methods and claim nuclear is unsafe.
<comment>
Didn't Obama close a facility that could hold all of the nations nuclear waste for political reasons?
<comment>
World leaders in almost every coutnry right now are 80 or 90 years old with lead poisoning
<comment>
Anon you are trying to apply a reasonable argument to politics. It wont work.
<comment>
It's kinda neat how people like you are going to get btfo and nobody will have any sympathy because you're so insufferable.
<comment>
The electorate are low IQ emotional hysterics, sad that the elites are taking advantage of that to erode the rest of our freedom.
<comment>
Apparently they're importing power from France which mostly uses nuclear power to make up for the deficit of solar and wind.
<comment>
That's been a political quagmire for decades
It literally made Harry Reid's career
<comment>
Who also seem to manage having more "incidents" in every single reactor than ever happened in all of german ones combined.
But hey, if any french mishaps happen the fallout will sure stop at the border and wait for immigration papers.
<comment>
Germans are great at tech/industry like cars watches cameras etc. etc. but they keep choosing piss poor politicians for leaders, 20th century history is proof of this.

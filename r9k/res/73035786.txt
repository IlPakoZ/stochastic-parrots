Stop looking like that anon...
Why do men do this? My bf did this the first time we had sex and it was so embarrassing. He still does it to this day. What do you gain from spreading it?
Curiosity,

Why the fuck would it be embarrassing? I'm sticking my tongue in there do you not look at your food before you eat it?
Because he was the first person I showed my vagina too and i'm still not really used to it. He was just inspecting it, i'm still nervous to let him eat me out even though he really wants to.
Shyness is cute, but I'd feel bad if my gf was really embarrassed

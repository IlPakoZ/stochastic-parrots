do normalfags think it's fine when a girl talks about her sex life? like if she randomly starts talking about how she's good at blowjobs or that she fucked some dude the other day. i find it a little weird. wouldn't women get weirded out if some dude said he fucked some girl real good?
I'm in the same situation rn. I just ignore it
Who cares? Turn it into funny conversations.
Oh, you're good at blowjobs? My dad always told mom I was. What's your favorite part? Personally, I love the taste.
ehhh you could do that but it doesn't change much.
Turk here, I immediately throw a brick
women are coomer spergs who can't read rooms
Did you collect some spares from all the earthquake destruction? You never know when you might need one.
I had my relatives send them to me in Germany, yes.
So I can bash some fat American muttwomans skull in it needed. And I will scream Heil Hitler while doing so

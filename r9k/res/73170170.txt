do normalfags think it's fine when a girl talks about her sex life? like if she randomly starts talking about how she's good at blowjobs or that she fucked some dude the other day. i find it a little weird. wouldn't women get weirded out if some dude said he fucked some girl real good?

Who cares? Turn it into funny conversations.
Oh, you're good at blowjobs? My dad always told mom I was. What's your favorite part? Personally, I love the taste.

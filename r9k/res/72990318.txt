as a white transgirl living in Korea, I can say Korean men are way too discriminating and sexually aggressive. I cant wait to go back home from this shithole.

Why not dress like the man you are? Then look like a tom boyish man (if that is a thing)
Every """men""" in Korea looks like a transgirl
probably using more makeup than you
ytboi
worthless in korea
lol
act like a sissy get treated like one
No way, did you actually try doing that?
Wouldn't it be way harder to pass among asians since even their males look like girls and you're probs taller too?

Does anyone else play hgames?
I can't think of a better sexual outlet for lonely men. You get higher quality content (most of the time), a rewards-based system makes the porn more meaningful, a lot of escapism, and characters to attach to. To me it's the best way to nut.
Come on in and share your favorite hgames, western games are accepted! I like myself a good western game. They're typically more graphic and explicit. It's a nice change from time to time.
Also feel free ask me for recommendations. I've played a shit ton and I have no problem with sharing. Keep in mind I don't have much experience with visual novels. I prefer sandboxes and trainers.

I've always wanted to get into H-games, but I haven't played them since the "Meet'N'Fuck" series was big back when I was really young. Now that I'm in my mid 20's, I wonder how far they've really come.
<comment>
I actually played MeetnFuck growing up to. I have their whole shitty collection saved. The ones you played on newgrounds were the best by far. Everything else is extremely low-effort garbage that was meant to entice people into paying for a membership on their website.
What do you like? There's some really popular titles that focus on harem content but are just better.

The evenicle franchise is kino. I'm so glad alicesoft games let you skip all those rape scenes and tentacle scenes, those parts of the Lore just reinforce my hatred towards the antagonists. I also play Yuzusoft games, Sen*Ren Banka was great. Donna Dohna too, can't wait for Evenicle 3 and Rance 9 and X to become english translated. while we're on the topic f hgames, has anyone know a game trilogy about mc falling in love with a close classmate/office worker/shrine maiden? (These are 3 separate games for each heroine but all the same trilogy.. with different mcs, went know if the universe or story is shared though.)

Also, anyone have good games to recommend like Evenicle or Succubus Affection? I love vanilla shit.
<comment>
For me, it's NTR games.
<comment>
When you reference Succubus Affection do you just mean side scrollers in general? There are lots of side scrollers out there. The ones that come to mind for me are Ayura Crisis!, Flower Witch/Fairy, or Max the Elf if you don't mind traps. I don't play many combat games. Do you like pixel art in general? There are games like Succumate, Summer Memories, Summer Life in the Countryside, or Aurelia.
I like NTR sometimes, mostly in games with female protags or if you're cucking someone else. Guess I don't mind voyeur either and that's kinda NTR.

Harem content is fine. I'm mostly a vanilla dude, and don't really like the ugly bastard or NTR style tropes that show up sometimes. I just wanna play something where I'm a dude where I meet a bunch of hot chicks who'd want to bang me.
<comment>
Nah I don't mean side scrollers or just pixel art in general, I'm a hardcore vanilla man. I dislike incest and ntr/nts so I make an effort to find vanilla shit that isn't just rape or reverse rape.

Karryn's Prison is a very good game with sex combat and side jobs
<comment>
Love this game but its way too tedious and must be played on easy.

Yes I found AA2 last year and like it a lot. I can get all the 'dyke' chicks to fuck but God damn, that chick with the long red ponytails, I can't figure her out.
<comment>
Well the classics are Summertime Saga, A Town Uncovered, What a Legend!, and a handful of low-quality 3D games like Harem Hotel, Once in a Lifetime. If you're feeling a little daring check out Four Elements Trainer, it's going to push your content boundaries a fair amount though.
AA2 is a pretty niche game. Some people find it and it gives them all they'll ever need.
<comment>
Well it's difficult to find high quality content that doesn't cross some of your lines.

I'm into the 90s h-games, the stuff released on PC-98 and Windows 95 for example. It looks so good, sounds so good, and just brings me to a nicer time. Pic related is my recommendation, a perfect example of what I'm talking about (VN, but I'd say the soundtrack makes worth downloading it from archive.org alone)
<comment>
Exactly, that's why I praise Alicesoft and Yuzusoft cause they have games that give you the option to be vanilla at least. Not all alicesoft games, but I got really invested into rance after knowing the guy changes and develops a consciousness in the later games. Evenicle because funny mc "he just like me frfr" when it comes to Horny and having morals
<comment>
Yeah, specifically I've been fixated on pixel art style. Any game taking place during the summer is nice as well. I found my favorite to be summer life in countryside. Her tits are too big but that's whatever, the gameplay is alright but the art is really cute

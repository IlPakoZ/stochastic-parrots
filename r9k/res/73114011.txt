My parents force me to take my medication and control it in front of me if i did take it and currently i am kinda in despair because I do not want to take that mind poison. I know it's just harming me. They don't trust me if i said I would take it on my own and so i see no way how I can avoid taking it. Do any anons know hot to avoid swallowing such poisionous medication?

you should probably go take your pills and have a shower buddy, then maybe some lunch?

I just stopped taking those stupid "meds" and went apeshit if my parents forced me to take them. They are a massive waste of money and degrade your mind.

Record them trying to force you.

How old are you? underage b&amp; imo

Law-wise they are in the right though. They could call the police if I didn't take my medication, as weird as it sounds. So I have to avoid taking them without them knowing it.

19, but I am NEET and I still live with my parents.

Hide it under your tongue and spit it out when they're gone

Unless you're in a legal guardianship or something, they absolutely can't force you to take medication

Just say no. It's that easy.

Two fingers to the back of your throat will help you vomit.

It doesnt work for me.

good job from your parents treating you the right way.
you scum who act like this put unbearable amounts of suffering on everyone forced to live with you. the meds help THEM deal with YOU, not YOU deal with YOURSELF, because we all know you don't want to do that. think about them feeding you just for you to be a useless schizo wasting time researching for your schizo babble or whatever next time you wonder if you deserve the choice.

I am taking Olanzapine and Zoloft for psychosis and depression.

keep taking them.
even if you feel like you're okay when you're off them you probably go a bit crazy already.
going psychotic is awful and you have no insight of anything that happened and/or how you behaved.
it's like sleepwalking; you wouldn't believe someone if they just said you sleepwalked.
what do you feel is bad about them?
you could leverage the meds if it's some side effect.
explain the bad things, say you'll keep taking them correctly if you get taken to the doctor to talk about it.
tell him about the bad things and he'll probably try some other meds.
everyone has a different proper combination of meds that just fixes problems. keep experimenting with the doc. if it's a bad one who doesn't care and is just shoving you pills and telling you to weather side effects, look for another one.

Please post slice of life anime in this thread.
I need a new show to watch so I can feel something when I get home from 10 hr shifts that make me want to an hero.
Last show I watched was Welcome to NHK, but I don't care if the protags are neets or losers or not, just any SoL anime.

I've been watching some sailor moon in recent months, has a lot of comfy SoL
There's a 24/7 sailor moon stream on plutoTV (along with a few other anime channels)
<comment>
thank you guys for these
I remember hearing about sailor moon a long long time ago but never watched it because bad internet, I will see if I like it anon, thanks!
<comment>
Sketchbook is a nice, easy show. Great ED.
<comment>
the old 90s show is comfy a lot of the time, not a big fan of the recent "crystal" adaptation
<comment>
Were you the one asking for recommendations in my NHK thread yesterday? If so, follow the FIRST recommendation that bitter fag suggested you: Oregairu (imagine translating) >>73153176
Another fun slice of life to make you want to commit an hero would be: 
ReLife 
Clannad (1st season and "After Story", literal suifuel) 
Sakurasou-no Pet Na Kanojo (omega suifuel, not worse than Clannad tho)
Tasogare Otomo X Amnesia (its Slice of Life with a good bit of mystery, tho it also made me want to kms)
Those 4 will make you realize how much you missed out in life. The last one isnt particularly powerful, but I was at a very low point in my life, and the final minutes of the last episodes literally almost made me bash my head into the wall.
The stories are engaging, fun to watch and very nice overall. Enjoy
pic rel is Sakurasou

you should watch higurashi, its a cozy anime about a group of kids living in a rural town and the hardships they struggle with
<comment>
Sketchbook Full Color's cured my sleep apnea
<comment>
I am anon, thanks for the recommendations. I wrote down the ones from the other thread too. I'm sorry you're feeling so bad, my life is pretty miserable too rn.
thanks, it sounds comfy anon, I'll watch
<comment>
Kengan Ashura is my favorite slice of life anime.
<comment>
My favorite SoL anime is "Little Busters!," it's about a teen with narcolepsy and his gang of high school friends. The leader of the gang is about to graduate and become a boring salaryman, so he forces everyone to join an impromptu baseball team to prove they still have agency in their lives and aren't just cogs in a machine. Decent chance it'll make you cry but it has pretty comfy vibes.
Also the Higurashi anon is lying to you, that show is really good but "cozy" is not the word I'd use to describe it.
<comment>
thanks anon! I think I would like this one
yeah lol I looked it up, sounds like higurashi is a murder mystery lol
<comment>
I'm sorry you're feeling so bad, my life is pretty miserable too rn.
I d say I feel the same, even tho I dont have to wageslave like you do, which I guess makes your pain 10 times worse.
I still remember the last episode I watched from Tasogare. It was like a crushing realization. Realizing how much I wasted all those years of blissful and carefree youth. And now the dream its over. There is no coming back. I legit broke down that day and felt a legitimate desire to die for 5 minutes, but then I got back to my senses. You feel like you are drowning and you are about to pass out. Sick freezing feeling.
The series aint that sad to be fair, its was just a mixed up of my own misery plus the situation in the anime.

Realizing how much I wasted all those years of blissful and carefree youth. And now the dream its over.
I've been having these exact same feelings recently.
Working 40hrs+ a week at a job I hate and realizing how dishonest and manipulative most adults are, and how much people's lives revolve around status in a hierarchy and how few opportunities there are in my day-to-day life for making real friends. Pretty much hell for an autist like me. I can't really live in my head anymore, I have to try to understand others better and get out of my autist fantasy world conception of reality.
Childhood really is the best time isn't it? When I was a kid I thought if I tried hard I'd have a good life as an adult, really I should have tried to be less shy I could have had friends.
Nice to share these feels with you anon
<comment>
how few opportunities there are in my day-to-day life for making real friends.
Implying there were any to begin with
When you reach wageslavery I hardly doubt there is chance to make up "friends" whom to hang with. Thats more of a "youth" thing. As people grow they focus solely in themselves, their families and their slavery.

Its not hard when you realize normals seek common objectives, whether is validation, attention, status, profits, etc.

That is... my biggest regret. There is nothing more useless than to put up the effort in school. You see how people who never lift a pen end up making six figures by chilling 4 to 6 years in college, or by having some random connection to a millionaire's son, or whatever.
Its like that wishful thinking based meme, where there is a black nerd dealing with big smart ass books in school, while black Chad and Stacy hang out and have a fun, and then the nerd becomes a CEO, and bla bla, you know how it goes.
And its all BS. It doesnt matter at all. 
And the reason is that... Even if they never knew how to study or learn anything because they had the time of their lives when they were teens, they have the "power of friendship" to learn together, as a normie team, to overcome apprenticeship or whatever they are enrolled at.

Yep, idk what I was thinking. Guess I was too naive/just didn't realize people all become like this as they get older.
There's opportunities for nerds to make friends too, it's not just for Chad and Stacy, I should have done that. I look back at my past self and I just can't believe how dumb I was, and probably still am.

Something that sort of bugs me is the fact that even so, I was and am so mentally screwed that I would have never been or be able to form connections with others. This caused by the thoughts of conspiracies against me and potential vendettas that may rise. Tho when I think about it, if it wasnt for all those bad experiences, who knows, maybe I wouldnt be so reclusive like I m rn.
There is so much I could ve done differently...
Its impossible to cope with any of this.
All because of the doubting...
I m also glad I found you again so we can share our guts together.
<comment>
Thanks anon, it's good to talk with you too.
I don't think it's impossible for you to find friends as an adult even if you missed out earlier in life. You may not fit in with normies too well but you can still find friends. I wonder what causes the conspiracy thoughts? I had them a lot too, and it's true some people are out to fuck you over or make fun of you, but other people aren't. Looking back I know there are people who if I had opened up to could have been my friends. And if some people did screw me over? Who cares really, it wouldn't have been the end of the world and I'd still have made real friends too with those who didn't.
I continued to fuck up in college by being too shy and not talking to almost anyone. But my social skills at that time were garbage. If you're around the avg age of college students and you want to go, that might be an opportunity to make friends with people. Or meetup groups for nerdy/robotish type people.
Shit may be fucked up but there is still a chance to find some happiness in life, I think.

Also you and me both....
I m so fucking dumb its unreal. But whats done is done. No point in changing who I m.

They are replacements. Compensation for stuff that was golden and now is gone. Its like if my pet died and you suggested me to buy a similar one. Its just not the same. There is nothing like hanging out at your ""friend's"" house in a hot summer afternoon, having fun, and realizing you aint got nothing to worry about in life. 
I dont want no damn substitutes. Its an insult to my dignity.
I had them a lot too, and it's true some people are out to fuck you over or make fun of you, but other people aren't.
If that was the biggest thing I had to endure, getting made fun of, then I wouldnt be this fearful.
And if some people did screw me over? Who cares really
Doesnt seem like it, but I got some dignity left. I m not some fucking phone cabin you use when you feel like and then leave the phone hanging. Its humiliating. And I m not down for any humiliation no more.

Dont even get me started with college. I dont have a single thing I could mildly relate to or care about any of those smart asses pieces of shit.
"Nerdy/Robotish stuff"
What does that even mean? Being a 4 eyed autistic freak who plays board games in some basement with Tom and Joe and wears a Fedora and random anime pins on his backpack?

part 2
I m a weirdo to the point I cant even find my own peace or force myself to care about people like them.
Idk man, maybe I m so rotten to the point I cant feel nothing but aversion for anyone around. I dont hate the normies, or the non normies. I dont hate Chad or Adam. I dont hate males or females. I hate everyone of them. Not with a killing passion, but I hate them. People disgust me to a point I cant see nothing but evil in them. I m sick of them.
I see their condescending looks. I see their disappointment, the disgust in their faces. 
Shit may be fucked up but there is still a chance to find some happiness in life, I think.
Maybe for you. 
In my case I m coming to terms with who I m, both the good and the bad. 
I m at a point where I m so reluctant to any sort of hope, because I dont want to suffer no kind of pain. I dont want to be defeated, humiliated or step on anymore. 
Not trying means no win, but also no pain or new bitter experiences.

non non biyori

I don't know what you had to endure but I'm sorry for the situation you're in. You sound like you have been hurt pretty bad and are traumatized by it.
It's painful to read this desu. I have had the same kinds of feelings before and it feels really bad. You don't deserve whatever bad things you have been through, I hope you will be happy one day even if you don't see that as a possibility. I'm sorry anon.
<comment>

I dont like to feel like I was a victim, since at the end of the day, I left vulnerabilities here and there that people eventually exploited. Its not about the trauma, but how humiliating everything ended up.
If all could be summarized with "being made fun of", maybe I wouldnt be here. Some people just breathe evil.
Everything burns...

It sounds like some really fucked up shit happened anon.

It was like a crushing realization. Realizing how much I wasted all those years of blissful and carefree youth. And now the dream its over. There is no coming back.
It's a grim realization. As a kid I heard my dad say the phrase that "Youth is wasted on the young" but of course I just brushed it off. By the time I was 16 I realized that I had already wasted the majority of my childhood and that I'd change before I turned 18. And then that day came and I realized that it was over, I didn't change at all and that I would never be able to go back and re-do it. What's done is done though and the feeling passed like you said.
<comment>

Wdym by that? I m still suffering for it lol, regardless if I cant do nothing about it.
But yeah. Its pretty depressing overall. Makes you not want to keep moving forward because you dont want a substitute for those things that you never experienced.
There is a song I love to listen to (currently listening to) that summarizes this feeling pretty damn well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BhhYcSwHQ4 [Embed]
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
(...)
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
(...)
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
DIE BURIED ALIVE
And thats all I m gonna do. Die suffocated and buried by the weight of my own sins.
Its over.
<comment>
Seconded for ReLife, but i recommend the manga since the anime ended pretty abruptly.
<comment>
i'm generally non-anime guy. i have seen about 10 shows at the best. but as a guys that lift weights, i liked dumbbell nan-kilo moteru? it's goofy as fuck but also is actually quite informative about lifting weights, diet etc (minus some bro science)
<comment>
Not sure if anybody else said this, but there steins gate. Good slice of life that have drama and mystery too.
<comment>
ive been watching chibi marukochan, its not exactly cute moe girls doing stupid sexualized shit but its pretty close, unless you just like watching slightly sexualized underage girls.
<comment>
how did nobody mention this, perfect world u will never experience
<comment>
I have a bad experience with this
waitt what exactly do you mean by that?
<comment>
doesn't clannad have a visual novel as well? how does it compare?
<comment>
Since its a VN with various routes, they did a great job in the anime by making each route and outcomes be part of one linear story. Ofc, at the end of the day, only one girl with stay with MC, but its not some sort of soulless anime harem, it has great plots for each routes and After Story is even better.
<comment>
be me
living with my Mom and Dad
I watch anime all day 
I ask /a/ for an anime
they tell me this Haibane Renmei, say it is a good one
I watch it each day, maybe two a day
I get to episode 6 "End of Summer,Rain,Loss"
Kuu is nowhere to be found
I hear a loud bang from down my stairs
It shakes the house
I think it must be nothing, maybe the drunk guy next door again
I hear a women shout up stairs, Hey Anon!! can you come down
I get up and walk down the stairs 
My Mothers friend is sat with my Mom
Her eye is swollen and a huge lump is over her eye
I panic and say WTF!!, whats going on?
My mother fell over and hit her head in the table end
I scream at the women to phone an ambulance 
They say no it is fine, I go mad and say no phone one now.
One arrives and takes my Mom and her friend to hospital 
I go back up stairs and carry in watching Haibane Renmei
but the anime is hitting me differently now
now i am feeling loss and fear 
Like I said, I had a bad experience and I will never forget this one
<comment>
oohhh you cruel bastard >:)))
I won't fall for that again
Beware of anon reccomendation friend
This is a horror series
<comment>
i don't want to invalidate your feelings at all, but that has nothing to do with the show, you just happen to watch it when something bad happend in your life. I think "i had a bad experience WITH IT" is bad phrasing in this case.
<comment>
i had a bad experience WITH IT" is bad
I never said "with it" 
I said "with this"
It doesn't matter anyway

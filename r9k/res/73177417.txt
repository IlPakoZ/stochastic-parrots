I just want to go back to 8 hour minecraft marathons, anons
I personally just miss having fun playing vidya pulling all nighters, going to sleep at dawn or just staying awake for 36 hours.
Ah I should get drunk and do that next time I'm on paid time off. If I'm lucky I might die too
do you even talk to people it work? i'm amazed a woman would do that if you just act like a drone who doesn't speak to anybody
gonna take the low energy pill
I talk to my coworkers sometimes. I'm generally pretty nice to people and try to help but I completely shut off when I get home or I'm at a party
yeah, i guess i failed to attract anyone at my last job because i kept to myself as much as possible at work because i'm always on edge or dead inside. oh well
Larptacular!
Well it happened, she is 4 11' and is kind of known for being a thot since she cheated on her ex boyfriend who is a chubster
Tell us the whole story then, Chad.
We were in the printing room and she ran her hand down my back and hit my butt when I was about to leave. Before that, we were just complaining to each other 
Also hugged when we went to a lunch a day later
Bend her over the photocopier and give her a hard fuck or forever accept the fact that you are a homosexual, OP. (There's no shame in that nowadays.)
If you're too tired to fuck her just ask her to be on top

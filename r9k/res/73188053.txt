i stopped caring about having a girlfriend after high school, at that point just dating would still make me feel subpar
so i decided to just try to build a bodycount to compensate
but even then when i go to clubs i end up attracting the nice girls that really just want a relationship
ffs why couldn't i be like this when i actually wanted, i just wanna be a douche but i inevitably come across as a goody two shoes
please i just wanna get sluts
i wanna being a slut home the night i meet her, not have several dates till i can sleep with a cute nerdy girl, that window passed for me
why does god hate me this much
So why not just go and make it clear what you want? You're obviously a normalfag and your only problem is not doing what you want to do
I hope a hard baguette go through your body destroying the flesh and giving you a horrible death.
i just wanna be a douche but i inevitably come across as a goody two shoes
it's out of your control. nobody will tell you this because they're selling you shit, but alpha isn't a mindset. you can't just be a douche and expect it to work. being a douche is the result of being chad and you can't pretend to be chad.
i don't get hoes so putting up with the shy girls is my best plan
close but not french
i've had hoes basically throwing themselves at me sometimes but i didn't have the finishing moves to bring them home when those cases happened, only after the nightlife here went to shit did i lose my virginity (and accidentally pump and dumped the girl)
Just pump and dump the nice girls faggot, nobodys gonna marry them anyway
this happens to me often, bitches want me for a nice relationship but you're mistaken if you're thinking theyre "good and nerdy" they're whores they just think that you're nice and good thus why they acting all pristine, i got told this by a chad friend of mine when complaining about the same, he said, they dont think of you as a fuck and dump because you're not attractive, he said it raw because i was drunk bitching about it, its over, no whores for you, only "good and nerdy acting girls", till you find a "nice wife" who is "pristine" and fucks only 4 times a year because youve been a good boy
my goal is to tease my way into being fuckbuddies but i need to get laid to start that
they just think that you're nice and good
you're not attractive
make up your mind
they just think that you're nice and good
you're not attractive
These aren't mutually exclusive.
they think "nice and good" as in you're not a fuckable dude, being nice and good person does not means you're attractive you stupid fuck, being hot its just that no background, being ugly its linked with "oh i dont want to hurt him so i will call him nice boy"
not sure why i ever expected anything more useful to come from this board

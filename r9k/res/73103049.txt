should we have a kind of alternate draft for women where they have to sign up to do things like cooking and cleaning and blowjobs for two years or they can't receive federal financial aid or welfare?

As if are men in draft are doing different things from those. You are in for a surprise, america doesnt even have fucking draft so stfu, while in countries that do you are gonna be peeling potatoes, mopping the floors and get raped by inmates for two years. Thats exactly what it is

If a draft ever happens again in the US, I will be completely certain it's because they decided the US will already lose, and are trying to kill as many young dumb goyim as possible.

Who would want to die for this pos country anyways. The current system only benefits women and attractive men. Not only that, but you are demonized for even daring to point it out.

I'd probably enter in all honesty. I don't really have anything to lose and even though modern America is flawed I think it can still be fixed.

Pregnancy draft would be most appropriate given the falling fertility rates.

I can't honestly say I give a shit anymore. For a long time I'd do mental gymnastics to convince myself that I should care, but I can't do it anymore. It's not even like I want to see it fail, I just don't care at all anymore, I feel completely apathetic to its future.

Nations are just powerful fictions to quietly replace extended bloodlines and exploit peasantry under the guise of superior organization. 
America is the ultimate example of this. It also was never flawed; it has done exactly what it was meant to do, and continues to do so. Do you actually think anyone making decisions here isn't in on the actual game, and protected from it's "externalities" (you)? The product of government and nation building isn't meant for you.

Nta but it's not meant for anyone. You think investment bankers or big law lawyers enjoy their life? Capitalism just dehumanizes people and treats them like cattle. It's a race to the bottom among nations in terms of who can exploit their population the most for the power of the nation as a whole.

I don't technically disagree, but capitalism is just a veneer for what is fundamentally the same exploitive system that all civilizations fall under. See the "superior organization" part; that's a big, founding myth that also applies to the communism scam. 
Investment bankers and high end lawyers are the errand boys of THE PROXIES of actual power. If capitalism was hurting the DuPonts or the Rockefellers or the Rothschild's, it would be erased immediately and everyone would cheer about it on the way to the gulag. 
And here we are, nobodies, talking about what amounts to complex jokes for anyone with real power. It's all such horror.

When I was in high school there was this fb page that this kinda weird girl ran, and she would post shit on there and the only person that would ever like her posts was the kid who talked to himself
 I get the same vibe from this

hey anon. i used to work in customer service via email/chat and i had totally forbidden engaging in these type of conversations, it would have me fired inmediately. BUT 100% i loved them and i really really wanted to casually chat back. but we were monitored at all times

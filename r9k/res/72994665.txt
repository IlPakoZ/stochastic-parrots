i'm an disagreeable autistic sociopath who for the majority of his lifespan had no friends
somehow managed to date a hot also lonely suicidal edgy mentally ill depressed girl in my early teens (practically made for each other) 
i don't have any social media accounts associated with anything irl so i haven't heard from her ever since we broke up besides an occasional weird prank call or message from her 
Fast forward to now
still have no friends
think of her again
stalk on instagram to find her account
she's an ftm tranny now
account filled with pics of her taking drugs, being in huge groups, being degenerate, etc
For people like us in our generation there were two communities where we can fit in: The LGBT and any right wing platforms. If she didn't go down the LGBT rabbit hole we might've still would've been close friends, but she chose the different path. It's sad that she's probably still enjoying life much more than I am and it bothers me.

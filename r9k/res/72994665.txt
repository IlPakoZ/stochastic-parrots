i'm an disagreeable autistic sociopath who for the majority of his lifespan had no friends
Fast forward to now
somehow managed to date a hot also lonely suicidal edgy mentally ill depressed girl in my early teens (practically made for each other) 
Fast forward to now
i don't have any social media accounts associated with anything irl so i haven't heard from her ever since we broke up besides an occasional weird prank call or message from her 
Fast forward to now
For people like us in our generation there were two communities where we can fit in: The LGBT and any right wing platforms. If she didn't go down the LGBT rabbit hole we might've still would've been close friends, but she chose the different path. It's sad that she's probably still enjoying life much more than I am and it bothers me.
anon you just have to drink and browse four chan. its what helps me.

I will never be a woman!
I will always be associated with the sex responsible for crime, rape, and murder. 
I will always look like an ugly man.
Even if I do pass, I can never accept myself as a woman, I will always be a fraud. 
That is all. See you tomorrow.

Don't worry! Women are equally terrible so you'll be shifting from one problematic gender to another. At least if you transition chasers like me will be attracted to you.

I have no gender dysphoria, but it's devastating to live life as a weak, anxious, dependent male knowing that the simple flip of a chromosome would take you from triggering a revulsion response in 100% of human animals to being accepted, valued, and understood.

Men are looking for a challenge and women are looking for an excuse. For every psychotic male are the dozens of psychotic women you will fuck him.

I can't watch this uncivilized barbarism. 
I will forever be perceived as a threat when outside at night.

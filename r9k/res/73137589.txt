I will never be a woman!
I will always be associated with the sex responsible for crime, rape, and murder. 
I will always look like an ugly man.
Even if I do pass, I can never accept myself as a woman, I will always be a fraud. 
That is all. See you tomorrow.
Don't worry! Women are equally terrible so you'll be shifting from one problematic gender to another. At least if you transition chasers like me will be attracted to you.
Women are equally terrible
Source needed. Not according to statistics.
Men are great at hurting you physically. Women are great at hurting you emotionally. They're beasts of different endeavors.
don't think about it so much. Just be you, live life and meet people that will support you.
correct
goodnight
I have no gender dysphoria, but it's devastating to live life as a weak, anxious, dependent male knowing that the simple flip of a chromosome would take you from triggering a revulsion response in 100% of human animals to being accepted, valued, and understood.
Men are looking for a challenge and women are looking for an excuse. For every psychotic male are the dozens of psychotic women you will fuck him.
It lives rent free in my mind 24/7!
Rape is no crime.
I can't watch this uncivilized barbarism. 
I will forever be perceived as a threat when outside at night.

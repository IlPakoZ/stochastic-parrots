Why do people assume you're friends when it wasn't really established?
With relationships, people at least make it official before saying they're in a relationship. But the same rule doesn't apply to friendships (evidently), and it's a regular occurrence for people to consider you a friend (or friends) when you never explicitly agreed to it.

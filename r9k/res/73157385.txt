What degree should someone get if their IQ is only 100?
I'm aiming above Starbucks barista but I'm aware of my limitations.
Trades. The degrees that are career oriented that are suitable to 100 IQ people are things like social work, they don't pay that great and are stressful.
You can probably be a programmer if you believe in yourself. It's not as hard as you might think.
No.
I can probably be a code monkey.
You know what happened to the space monkeys right?
Call it whatever you want. I'm a "code monkey" making six figures without needing to put in much work. It's way better than whatever other thing you're trying to pursue - I assure you. AI will make you more employable, not less employable, if you harmonize with it than fight it.
Okay let's take it up a notch then.
What's decent in the 105-110 bracket.
I can probably be mediocre enough at that if i try.
What about for 114 iq?
If you look at this chart, the only impossibility is you becoming a medical doctor.
How the hell did you land a job?
I'm half through a cs degree and sweating bullets worrying about technical interviewing
Yeah.
Education is 90% motivation and not natural intelligence. You dont need to be a genius, you only need the ability to work hard at something theres no immediate benefit in.
Don't bother with a degree. Learn a trade. AI can't snake a drain.

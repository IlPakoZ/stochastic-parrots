What degree should someone get if their IQ is only 100?
I'm aiming above Starbucks barista but I'm aware of my limitations.

Trades. The degrees that are career oriented that are suitable to 100 IQ people are things like social work, they don't pay that great and are stressful.

You can probably be a programmer if you believe in yourself. It's not as hard as you might think.

You can probably be a programmer 
No.
I can probably be a code monkey.
You know what happened to the space monkeys right?

Call it whatever you want. I'm a "code monkey" making six figures without needing to put in much work. It's way better than whatever other thing you're trying to pursue - I assure you. AI will make you more employable, not less employable, if you harmonize with it than fight it.

How the hell did you land a job?
I'm half through a cs degree and sweating bullets worrying about technical interviewing

Yeah.
Education is 90% motivation and not natural intelligence. You dont need to be a genius, you only need the ability to work hard at something theres no immediate benefit in.

Don't bother with a degree. Learn a trade. AI can't snake a drain.

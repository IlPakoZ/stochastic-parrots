billion dollar industry to watch grown ass man put balls through a net 
We live in a simulation dont we?
Supply and demand. This is simple economics. Since most people have food, shelter, water, whatever, society csn afford to spend money on this shit. Whether it's a good thing or not is a different matter.
Americans worship niggers. It's a religion.
Im just imagining how humans 10k years later will think
pre space colonization humanity found entertainment in watching lower races joust one another and put balls into a small net
some of these players would become famous and lead societal change and racial equality and fight against white supremacy
If there's going to be any humans in 10k years that have the capacity to discuss history, they're going to be decedents of Asians and not care about this bullshit. It might be a blip note on the downfall of ancient civilizations.
There aren't going to be humans 10k years later. Humans are very short sighted and have low delayed gratification. They'd rather consoom shit and watch TV than work on math/science to figure out how to make the world a better place. This is the result of the free market, where we believe that allowing full freedom of choice leads to the best outcomes.

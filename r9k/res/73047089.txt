'Tis the life of a fujo.

Ozen is a literal single granny. She's the equivalent to a dirty old man

That's probably a really satisfying fetish. Now I'm not a tranny, but if I was one, having sex with a terf would probably feel inherently rewarding
<comment>
yes but i would still call them she

I'm scared of cis women. 
They have so much power over me.

female tranny chasers
Looks like incel transmaxxing unironically works.

It does until it doesn't, how many passing trannies exist, let alone passing trannies at ages 40+? A relationship built on a fetish like this won't last in most cases, especially if the physical aspect deteriorates.

Older trannies only look bad in most of the pics you see because they also started at 40 or 50.
Males going on hrt wasn't common until relatively recently in history. The ones who started younger are going to age fine. Possibly better than regular womem age since they won't go through menopause.

The shit you delusional troons tell yourselves is just incredible.

I'm not a tranny, I just masturbate to them.
Regular women's hormones die when they hit menopause (unless they take tranny pills themselves to treat hot flashes). Trannies stay on the same hormone intake regardless of how much they age since they get it exogenously.

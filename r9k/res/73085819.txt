Anons, If my conversations with randoms die quickly, am I too boring. or am I just autistic? Someone literally called me boring, so maybe that's one hint. My conservations never last.
there's two possible reasons to that
1 - you have nothing to talk about because you spend your life at home and not doing anything 
2 - you're autistic or assburgers and you can't into social interaction
these people aren't that interesting, though. they are probably like me. maybe because I'm not funny?
hell if i know. Can you greentext your typical conversation? A screenshot would be even better

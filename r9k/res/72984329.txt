Currently a senior in hs and am looking for the quickest way towards neetdom. The plan is to move out right after graduation, get a job as a chef at the restaurant i work at (im a waiter), save up for a couple years and then lock myself in my room and forget about the world until my id have to work again. Are there any faster options?

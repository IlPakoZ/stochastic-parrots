Do you think society is collapsing?
I think it is being hollowed out, like a sinkhole forming under a road. The road works fine until something heavy crumbles the thin top layer.
Not yet, the economy has to go first. As soon as there's any announcement of a major war or attack, it will.
Society is, yeah. It's the internets fault though. Social media and all that shit.
Society is always collapsing, they'll tell you whatever gets you scared so they can make money off of the paranoid populous who believes we're encroaching upon the end times 
No, it's not collapsing, but saying that doesn't make money
Basically, yes. Though everyone but noticers has ignored it.
It seems to have reached critical mass, but there's little awareness of it.
I guess people like being wage-slaves and not getting sex anymore.
Bread and circuses, indeed.

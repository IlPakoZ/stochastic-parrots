I recently started an engineering degree but ended up having to take a semester off because I my marks were horrible and I was living in filth. To make a long story short I got diagnosed with adhd and was put on adderall. I am going back this fall but am worried that I will fuck up again. What do?
What do
Stop living in filth and get your marks up.
After doing this get off adderall, that shit is poison.
If you act like you dont have adhd your brain will become the brain of a person without adhd
The adderall is really helpful rn and I am improving a lot while on it. However, this is based on my behavior at home and I have only used the adderall for a few months so far.
Thats why i said fix your surroundings and then fix yourself.
The drugs should be a band aid while you fix everything else, not something permanent
For a few months so far
How are your grades???
Have you fixed your environent?
I cannot function well at all off them.
ended up having to take a semester off
My grades have no changed as I am at home rn. I keep my room clean and do chores so if you are referring to me physical environment then yes I no longer live in filth.
My schizo friend turned into mr think tank after adderall so maybe you will turn to a chad as well
Sadly it does not work that well. It just gives me enough motivation, energy, and focus to act like a normal person. I dont become an academic machine on it.

I wish I had a personality lmao
You mean a "likeable personality" i guess. Everyone has a personality if they are not a vegetable.
You never achieved either depersonalization, derealization, or transmarginal collapse
i achieved all of the three when astral projecting
I am likeable, just not interesting. I'm extremely shallow. Nobody wants to talk to me for longer than a minute
Well I can see that but who cares. It's always some drama with normalfags. Never met a "popular" or "interesting" person who didn't create drama or wasnt surrounded by it.

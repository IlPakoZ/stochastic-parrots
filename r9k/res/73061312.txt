Arise, Knightbrothers of Nofap. Today is the Day of Saint George the Dragonslayer. 
Nofap is our proverbial dragon, and we are in an eternal process of slaying it each and every day we cling to this Eternal Nofap of ours. 
Today, I feel vindicated in knighting all those who have stuck to this nofap from January 1, Midnight. 
You are hereby inducted into the Order of the Dragonslayer. 
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

Timeloop Guy? From last year? I found you again! How've you been? Glad you've kept to your goals this time. Wishing you the best, friend.

Yes. One and the same. I've been better, but I've also been far worse. I'm glad I managed to stick to my goals too, I finally hit 100+ days. So, at a time of my choosing, when I'm ready. I can depart. 
But yes, it's nice to bump into you again. I was thinking about you just recently, oddly enough. 
And the same to you, friendfellow.

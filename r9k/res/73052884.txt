Why are Americans so trigger happy? If it's not a mass shooting, it's a kid getting shot for stepping on someone's lawn or something.

I dont think leafs are getting much more sex and they are nearly as widely armed. Yet they seem to have less shootings nationwide than what goes on in one of the worse US cities.

Americans society is generally mentally ill and drug infested. Basically everyone is fucked either financially or mentally, very rare people have "good" lives.
So it's only natural that they're more violent and extreme.

U.S has firearms very much available to many people. Including but not limited to criminals and mentally ill people. This means that people who have fantasies of harming others have access to those firearms. In addition to this the culture in U.S is very competetive. It forces people at the very bottom of society take advantage of every opportunity given and take extreme measures not to get caught as this could mean tens of years if not lifetime imprisonment... This combination causes the criminals to be more likely to take part in deadly crimes and people more likely to take extreme measures inorder to defend themselves.
Can't say my credentials after thinking about it for a while. Not a glowie though. But I do understand the situation better than most people. So I guess you'll just have to count on my word. Or if you're smart, just thinking it while considering what I said might lead you to the same outcome, thereby verifying what I said.

So we all agree that the best robot jobs are factory and warehouse. 
Now how tf do I get one. I've cleaned up indeed and others. 
How did you get yours? Did you really went outside and asked for it directly? That's a considerable endeavour for a robot. Idk if am ready.

I applied for an amazon warehouse job on some website, then got a text back more than a year later offering an interview

Yeah that's the plan, I've been sending applications in all those job websites but nothing.

I nepotismed my way into the factory.
Factory work can become very depressing. You quickly pick up the work without thinking and your body builds the shit while you are alone in your head. You can have good days where you spend all day in your head having nice daydreams, but you can have depressing days where you spend all day beating yourself up in your head. It is very easy to slip into that mindset
You are also expected to be manly man and you have to build up and practice a solid normalfag back story for yourself and stick to it. Normalfag staples like sex and gfs WILL be asked of you on day 1

Indeed. Lie on your resume, then say you're rusty on the details so they train you. Work hard, pay attention, become competent and reliable. If anyone asks, you are not a KHHV. Simple as.

at the point they'd texted me, I'd already found another job, quit it, and gone back to uni.
but if you can wait, then go for it.

CAD monkey or courier. You need something you're allowed to listen to music and be alone without using your brain except for hand eye coordination.

Nobody is actually hiring, despite the supposed "shortage." It's an old jewish trick to make your goyim slaves keep working just a bit longer; you run them short-staffed to put more jewbux in the owner's pocket, but always promise them that they're going to be rescued soon. They'll keep treading water, like that rat experiment, much longer that way. As long as the staff you've got can bust their asses hard enough to keep things running then clearly you don't need more employees. Work harder, goyim.
When one of them finally snaps and quits and you're actually so short staffed you can't maintain the hustle and it starts costing you money, then you'll magically hire someone immediately... but not until then. 
Big jew companies are still getting paid shitloads of taxpayer goybux for "Covid Relief" for their "underemployment problems." It's all a big gay jewish scam.

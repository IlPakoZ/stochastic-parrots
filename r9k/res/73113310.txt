Anons who have been in a relationship that ended, what made it end? What can someone do to avoid the mistakes that happened in your relationship? And what is a break up like? What do you do afterwards?

Lost job and had to move away.
Don't be poor.
Being poor sucks. Breaking up sucks.

You know better than women. Don't fall for their tricks.

Don't let her work in a hospital around doctor Chads
It sucks
Avoid contact, cry a little

I broke up with her because her sex drive was too high, and she was a bitch.

what made it end?
last relationship was about 6 months ago, old friend i used to go to school with, messaged me 4 months in telling me she kissed her manager (femoid) at work and she wasn't interested in a relationship the day after i took her out for a date, all on me
What can someone do to avoid the mistakes that happened in your relationship?
don't pay for bitches food and don't make yourself emotionally vulnerable, ultimately just avoid women lol
what is a break up like?
the feeling of rejection is pretty common across the whole of my life so it just pisses me off, i just focus on work now and avoid women. Was only really mad that i spent about 150 on dates
What do you do afterwards?
Go gym, focus more on work or something, use hate as a motivator to achieve more and avoid women i guess

She fucked her manager at the work Christmas party (passed out in his bed according to her but I never believed that bs) after 5 years (it was on our 5 year anniversary as well - fucked me after she did the deed as well which I would consider rape as I wouldn't have consented had I known the truth but w/E I'm a straight white man so who gives a fuck right? ). 
Blackpill pure and simple - I'm 5'9" he's 6'3". they're together now and happy. Also she kicked me out of her grandparents' place as a result. Not gonna lie I nearly offed myself last year but decided against it and chose to persist in the doomed world that [she] created because mum would be sad.
Kind of go around as a husk these days with some vague optimism things will get better but I know they won't. It's fat chicks all the way down from here as far as I see it now. Life is fucked, don't ever trust a woman and certainly never marry one (one thing I did right in this whole shabang)

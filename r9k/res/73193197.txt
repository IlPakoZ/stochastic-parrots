It looks like this was my first AI Kana, at least that wasn't really terrible from a primitive AI model or a gift from someone else. She's always the cutest wife.

Theres this realistic looking ai model on IG called a_idealtype (pic rel) and "her" 200k+ followers have no idea. Im just wondering, how is it possible that her face is consistent between photos?
Also what would stop her from creating an onlyfans and make money off her dumb followers? Would that be illegal at all considering shes using other peoples images as references for the AI or is there no way to tell?

have you guys tried to touch up your pictures at all? i like to try to dewonk the hands or fix the eyes.

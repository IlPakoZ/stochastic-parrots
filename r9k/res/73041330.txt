The best time of my life was in Leicester city some years ago,
Was in the last floor of student dorms, 
Woke up daily to the calling of a group of doves,
I remember helloing them every time I woke up.
It was extremely wholesome.

All refugees should be young females, otherwise it is invasion.

I think people fear Russia because Russia is a country with a soul.
The war is absurd, they are fighting for tiny amounts of land. It is suspicious and it seems to me like abstract genocide.
Canada is the size of Europe, all Ukrainians can move to Canada. Including the males as they are clearly not at risk of being an invasive entity.
<comment>
To me it seems Zelensky is a fake leader that is merely murdering Ukrainians and Russians as a puppet of Israel.
There is no aspect of my soul that desires the death of ANY Russians and Ukrainians.

settling in for a quiet nice evening of ibuprofen, co-codeine 30mg codeine prescr, naproxen, progablin, alcohol, weed edibles, weed flower, nicotine and apparently a kingston ssd i pulled out of another laptop because i sat on it and smashed my old screen
ahhh freedom

not of body because ive got sciatica
and ive got a cocktail of drugs that i imagined would be good for both pain, healing, and feeling high

I've been training my Apu to make well constructed contributions to the thread whilst completing QMEE surveys for most of last year and just this February he was finally competent enough to be left alone at the PC by himself.
Well, anyway - my Apu was scrolling through /britfeel/ looking for some good chances to make some posts in between QMEE surveys - when at some point he scrolled over one of those flashing epileptic fit inducing goon gifs.
He's fucking dead. Found him twisted up in his chair like a fucking wet pretzel. Poor lid was fitting for hours before I found him. Little lid had swallowed and shat out his own tongue.
You may think it's just a laugh but now my favourite frog is fucking gone.
He was such a rare fucking breed too. One of the Haddenham Heirloom Helpers. Irreplaceable. There's only about 1024 left if you take my one off the tally.
Just in fucking tears. Here he is in happier times.
I didn't even get to say goodbye to him.

Passed out at work and convulsed. Everyone thinks it might be epilepsy so my employer lost their shit, but it was just a non epileptic fit, which i was unlucky enough to have because i got queasy think about blood, seldom happens though as i have a strong stomach.
Basically though dvla want me to wait y months to prove i wont "fit" again and until then i cant drive. Im screwed as work is far away, and the closest office means im only good for desk work, which is half my job.
A specialist opinion is what every party wants and thatll takes weeks if not months...
Been busting my ass to get basic shit all week long by walking and cycling. I dont either. But being forced to and losing the ability to drive is depressing.
And the slight doubt that maybe i am fucked medically...
I need a squeaky clean DBS so i cant afford being prosecuted for anything
<comment>
I dont mind either**
6 months**
Also ive been stuck home for a week on forced medical leave whilst my workload has just piled up.
Funny how life just randomly decides to beat your ass

I went to the gp and he flat out said he cant say for sure what it was just as the hospital doc said too. All want me to see a neurologist
Cant make this shit up.
As for ride sharing, im the only person at work who lives where my town is. Maybe at the satellite office during work hours theyll play taxi and get me to my work sites
My life has legit done a 270 degree plot twist.
Appreciate what good things you have folks

LOL she says she wants a whole week to decide now (on whether or not a long distance relationshit ""is worth it"" to her, that is)
She knows exactly my [redacted] appointment is next week too, so she's probably doing this on purpose and to try and fuck with me
No fucking way man, i'll give her an 48 hour extension/deadline now and that's it
<comment>
Why do that when you can immerse yourself in a vidya game? A book will never live up to the experience of playing something like the Last of Us or Ico.
<comment>
22 years old and aging well our laurel dreams.
<comment>
She's read more books in a month than you have in a lifetime.
<comment>
She's gonna be up there with gibi someday once the algorithm stops being a dick.
<comment>
She absolutely hates video games beyond casual shit that isn't too difficult.
<comment>
She used to cut her wrists because you can see the scars by enhancing them. Lots of little ones. I don't get why a girl would do that since they get attention and sympathy so easy just from being female. If a male did that he would be ridiculed.
<comment>
i hate living in this shithole country
let me out lads
<comment>
My respect towards the female starts when I start getting the same level of respect. As a male, I am treated like dirt. Simple as.
<comment>
This country is going to shit. I'm praying for some good riots soon. Need a good smash up and let the blacks wreck havoc.

Can't stand his pretentious "deep" films. There's so much better shit to watch beyond that mainstream crap.

I'll never know the true story. I'm still banking on abuse by someone in her family. That's why she moved to this country I think...to start fresh.
<comment>
Garn ingest some brekkie in about 5-10 me
<comment>
Kek i hate you schizos for always spewing these types of illogical non sequiturs
<comment>
She hates the show Pretty Little Liars because an older man is dating a girl in her prime. Apparently you're a nonce if you date a legally consenting teenage girl in your twenties.
<comment>
Several times she has mentioned age gaps in films and books. I don't know why. Daddy issues maybe. As long as it is legally consenting nobody should have the right to dictate who can and can't be in a relationship.
<comment>
Man up and stop crying like some female.
<comment>
Middle aged is 30 for her. Over for you old lads.
<comment>
Yup once you get to 30, life is fucking over. Women lose their fertility, men lose their hair. It's all downhill after 30. If you haven't got your shit together by 30, then don't expect it to get any easier past this age. 30 is the new 40.
<comment>
I have free will. Females fear that. They can't take that from me. Consequences only come after.
<comment>
One day a female will feel my pain. I'm the real victim here.
<comment>
Fockin ell proper good brekkie this was
<comment>
I could go out right now and follow that female walking to work at the hospital. She always leaves around this time in her uniform. A healthy one, always walks alone. Looking at her through my blinds and seeing the glow of her phone. She's probably Chad hunting. She doesn't even know I exist...yet.
<comment>
The good thing about living near London is the transport. It wouldn't take me very long to get to the places I need to be.
<comment>
Why the fuck should I die an incel? Being incel is mental torture. It will drive some men to do things they never thought they were capable of. All because women want attractive Chad and treating their body like a commodity. If you ain't got the looks, the money, you ain't get her body. You ain't getting your natural needs met.
<comment>
"Go find your looksmatch."
How the fuck can I when even those fat bitches demand some Chad? I'm not fucking fat. I shouldn't be a looksmatch for a fat pig. I'm not wanting a model tier girl.
<comment>
I need to unleash this bottled up anger and sadness someday.

<comment>
They always pick attractive men these average as fuck women. Since there's so many more men than women, you are truly fucked (not literally). Only the best looking men win this game.
<comment>
They aren't involuntarily celibate.. they are voluntarily celibate. If they cleaned up their act and lowered their standards I guarantee they could find someone to have sex with them. They are making the choice to be the way they are and be picky.
The thing is, they probably wouldn't even need to lower their standards. There are plenty of gorgeous women who have sex with "unattractive" men all the time. The difference is the men who do get those women are actually good people who are genuinely fun to be around
Nope. Bullshit. Lookism. Blackpill.

Me before spending too much time on 4chan:

seeing no girls
bitter and reclusive

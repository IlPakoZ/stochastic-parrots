Recently I've noticed this girl glancing over at me quite a bit at the gym. We go at the same time, but she comes with her chubby friend. I was thinking about having this guy I used to sort of know wingman me. We've been meaning to catch up lately, so I was thinking maybe we could hang out with these girls on a sort of double date. It'd be kind of lame for him since obviously he'd have to distract the chubby one, but he definitely doesn't mog me in any way that would suggest he could steal the pretty one from me. What do you guys think? Is this a good way to casually hang out with these girls? I figured we could just walk a block away to the Chipotle and eat together after the gym and then go from there.

Don't hang out with both of them fool. wait for the living lard pile to go to the bathroom or something and introduce yourself like a normal person.

Qt is fat cunt's wingslut. Qt is the bait. Beware the switch.

anyone or anything distracting you from your gym session means you will not be performing at optimal levels, leading to potential injuries. Focus on yourself at the gym. The gym is a temple of iron worship, it is not for pleasure. It is for quiet meditation. I suggest you either ignore her, or go at another time.

 Blah blah blah words words words
Meanwhile...
Hey, you're really cute. Where are we going tonight?

I would have to wait forever for the stars to align, they go literally everywhere together and I'd basically have to be watching them like a hawk just for that slim possibility
I don't wanna believe it, but maybe. But if that were the case then why is the qt always looking at me and not the fatty? Also, I walked past them recently and I swear the qt got in my way so I'd brush up against her ass, but maybe I'm tripping. Either way I've cause qt glancing over either through the mirror or when I make sudden head turns. I also think I might be inherently more valuable at the gym because honestly most guys there are manlets. And I'm not even that tall. When I step outside the average male height jumps up like you wouldn't believe, but in the gym I mog
You're right honestly. Although I don't get distracted easily, I've lost focus once or twice in the past two weeks because I've been paying more attention to my surroundings. I'm still full focus on my compounds no matter what though

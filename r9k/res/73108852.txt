Masculinity is a measure of your exceptionality
Femininity is a set of traits that women happen to be born into

Height
Face
Baseline test levels determined most likely by genetics 
 Masculinity is a measure of your exceptionality
How so? Sounds like the game was rigged from the start to me.

Men must be tall attractive and successful 
Women just have to be thin and pretty and that is all

Most men don't have good enough genes. Hence the ones who do are exceptional.

Masculinity is not about having good genes, it's about being a provider and someone who thinks outside the box

The strongest warrior in the tribe dies all the time while the beta figures out a way to store food for the winter so he doesn't have to hunt. Then he reproduces despite having weaker genes
This is symbolic of the human race as a whole. A species of flabby cucks who cannot survive or even protect themselves in the wild without tools

Traditional masculinity is nowhere near about height and looks alone, testosterone level being determined and unmutable is bullshit as well, but yes those things are good multipliers to expressure of masculinity

Testosterone bloodlevels by YEAR

Traditional masculinity is not something that got lost. It's something that made less and less sense as men became less masculine due to to the environment. All of these guys "relearning it" are just playing pretend, faking it. 
t. Have fluctuating T levels

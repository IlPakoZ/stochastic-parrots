getting a new passport at a government building 
waited for a elevator with several other people
suddenly, a weird moaning came from the toilet
everyone watched in terror as the thing that made that sound slowly moves outside
Yes, moves, I can't even say it is fucking crawling because that would insult the whole concept of crawling 
the thing turned out to be a highly deformed, extremly mutated mountain of flesh whose thick appendages struggle to support its body
lumps of flesh infested its whole body, and its head is almost engulfed in such lumps and only a strand of messy hair, a single, sinister eye and an inhumanely large mouth is visible 
the thing slowly walks to me as everyone around ran the fuck away
it started to mumbling incoherent voices with its pulsating mouth in front of me while doing crude gestures with the two appendages that I can only assume are arms
I literally stood in fear as the creature pinned me down and continued to mumble its words, on the verge of pissing myself
Slowly calmed down myself as the creature didn't maim me and instead growls like it is trying to say something
tried to listen to what it is saying
It's words started to make sense
he was saying 'hey kiddo,are you interested in joining the military?There are many benifits' and other things about the military with a raspy as fuck voice and heavy southern accent
He was just a fucking deformed military recruiter 
said no thanks
He told me to have a good day and moved away
jesus christ what had the American military became

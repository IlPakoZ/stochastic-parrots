Robots all look like this and then wonder why no girl ever wants to date them
Lose some weight you fat fucks how's a girl supposed to proudly present you to get friends and family when you look like this?

I would very happily date a man who looks like this. This is pretty much perfect.

I'm skinny

I'm 6'2 and 160 lbs. Also I'm pretty sure that there's tons of women and men, mostly men, into that body type.

I definitely do not look like this. My titties are 5 times bigger, my gut is 3 times bigger and my thighs are twice as big.

It's not just nostalgia, our world is actively being made to look more brutalistic and sterile. I'm not saying to go full greco-roman architecture, but what the hell happened to having aesthetic stores and houses? Everything new is a hastily slapped together cube that's still extremely overpriced

red doesn't sell food
fast food is way more expensive than it used to be, so they try to hide this fact with more minimalist designs 
Thats my take anyway.

You will have no soul
And you will be happy

Growing up in the 70s and 80s I assure you, variety in architecture and design for corporations/franchises fucking suck. Everything is a shitty eyesore vying for your attention. It wasn't until I went to Europe for a holiday and saw old buildings being converted into these stores did I realise how much nicer it is when shops are unassuming.

Imagine being nostalgic for fucking McDonald's.
<comment>
Interesting. And I say this applies to not just McDonald's but literally every fast food chain. Every building looks the same (rented office space), a strip mall rectangle or cube with drab Grey or beige colors. So it's about maximizing profits at any cost to pump out as much goyslop as possible? Don't these people realize how ugly they make the landscape?

Inflation, mass marketing, the hunt for ever more efficient way to make your company modular so you can build up/tear down in the most cost effective way possible, so basically capitalism is what happened.

don't people realize how ugly they make the landscape
Maybe representative capitalism would be the term?
Like in the same way you can only change things if you get millions of people to vote for a guy to maybe represent you, you'd need millions of people to buy into a company that maybe cares about aesthetics.
Theres also just a general fear people have. For example. Someone had a tree fall on their house, a couple of years later he cuts down an old tree that looks like it might fall. His property is now tree free and looks awful.
Some of his neighbors, some old ladies see that he cut down all his trees and they dont know why but the don't want to risk it so they cut down their trees to. Now the neighborhood is treeless and looks like shit.

We are in a process of major centralization again. Big corpos sucking up everything and squeezing every single penny out of anything they sell.
Everyone just copies the best solution and waits for big guys to innovate (or end up being bought by big corpos anyway).
You can thank forced inflation for that.
all smartphones look exactly the same
AAA games look exactly the same
logotypes look exactly the same
architecture looks exactly the same some modern industrial style
<comment>
I don't think capitalism is to blame, since if you're making money without giving people what they want then can you really call it capitalism?
<comment>
McDonalds in particular made that big change in appearance because they were under fire for so long for aggressively marketing to kids. They were the scapegoat for childhood obesity, so they rebranded to a more "mature" image and rose the price of all their food. Yeah, it's boring, but you can't criticize boring as being morally wrong on the same level as getting kids addicted to corn syrup.

So it's about maximizing profits at any cost
This is how every single business works now. Economic survival of the fittest has now made everything extremely horrible and it's only getting worse

I think this is just the end point to american culture and capitalism. The only way to stop this is for America to stop being the cultural power.

Almost all of these changes are imposed by local planning boards withholding needed permits for construction or alterations until they get the "look" they want.
Just about every picture posted on the internet asking "Why mean corporashun do this?" is asking the wrong question. They should be asking who DEMANDED that the corporation do that.
Beginning in the early 90's planners everywhere decided that McDonald's looked bad, so they used sign regulations to demand changes in color, elimination of the "golden arches", etc. Basically they pointed a gun at franchisees and demanded they disguise their McDonald's as "Not-a-McDonald's".
The problem is that every generation of planners makes new stupid mistakes in their quest to solve the problems created by the last generation of planners. The only places in the US that look anything like what urbanists consider good arose in periods when there was almost no planning AT ALL other than laying down the street grid.

What do you think the end game of this is? Fully AI-run automated goyslop distribution cubes?

The endgame is mass revolution followed by liberal star trek communism

We need an era of memphis as a palette cleanser to all this minimalist crap.
<comment>
I legit don't understand how some people order door dash like four or more fucking days a week and justify spending that. Like not only is fast food more expensive but your also paying for it to be delivered
<comment>
Everything on the right looks better.
And to everyone else in this thread, you guys are fucking insane if you think 80s and 90s aesthetic was actually better and not just nostalgia.
<comment>
Corporations have all the power , they collect taxes and point guns , nobody demands cooperation do anything, they literally write the laws.
The only way to stop the corpos is to unify together and use force to make sure we as a hive mind get what we want. The only way we can get the buildings we like is to make sure nobody who has any control over making buildings. 
Just look at the job they did when they could make the restaurant they wanted. It should be illegal!
<comment>
Some people make enough money that the detriment is immaterial. They would rather make more money than sacrifice the comfort of doordash.
Other people are dumb and poor. Poor people make really bad spending decisions with their small amount of buying power.
<comment>
Full time doordash driver here. I have regulars that order not only every single day but also multiple times a day. A lot of them don't even live in rich houses. They spend thousands of dollars a year on food delivery just to not have to leave the house

It just seems like artsy shit vs minimalistic efficiency with 0 redundancies, purely focused on performance. Or, form vs function.
I dont even necessarily agree with you but the way I worded it paints the right better now that I think about it.
<comment>
Also you should consider the availability of all these items then vs now. The more minimalist it becomes in form seems to scale with how accessible it is to plebs.
<comment>
Mcdonalds is less accessible though, since its more expensive. Besides price and change of building its the exact same accessibility its had since the 80s
<comment>
they started with the shitty Swedish modern architecture way before they started price gouging
<comment>
Actual brutalism can be pretty cool. You're thinking of corporate minimalistic styles like scandinavian style or high-tec.
<comment>
The minimalistic mcdonalds just looks like a single 'block' of your brutalist example sitting by itself.
<comment>
Bottom looks better. You'd know if you actually lived in the time of the top. It's more modern and appealing. Eat shit, zoomer.

Unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. So while it seems hidden, the soul is real in everything.
Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:
https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]
It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 
"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."
Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.
Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:
"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."
Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.

Ok gen X cuck, then why are old American towns so Kino and walkable? The 1800s were objectively comfier
<comment>
It's saving money. All fast food restaurants are now modeled the same in case they want to relocate.
<comment>
The 1800s would call the top image gaudy trash and the bottom more moderate and respectable. Old restaurants looked like shit, smelled like shit, and the food was shit.

be me
severely depressed
actually thinking of an hero myself
get a gun and have it loaded under my bed at all times for when i finally have the guts to do it
be one day
seriously thinking of doing it
decide to order one last meal on uber eats
sudden idea
realize that if im gonna go i may at least get to act a little silly just for fun
device a plan to have some fun
order uber eats and cross the street to the house just in front of me right before the delivery guy arrives
flag him down and tell him i chose the house in front (my real house) by accident and give him my name and order so he gives me my burger
he leaves and go back home
be enjoying my burger and report it and tell them he never even knocked on my door
tell them to check his location and stuff 
be laughing my ass off because he probably got in trouble or something
be next day, shit gets better
hear ruckus outside my house
it's the delivery guy fighting with my neighbor claiming he got fired because of him
obviously dont go out or let myself be seen
see the delivery guy run to his car and drive away and my neighbor on the phone
ask wtf is going on and he says he's calling the cops on him for trespassing
tell him i memorized his license plate (i actually have them from the order record) and give him the number but tell him to not involve me as a witness or anything cause i dont want to get in trouble
neighbor thanks me and tells me he's pressing charges on the guy
sometimes life is good anons, you just have to act a little silly
you're a horrible person, wtf
nothing would be sillier than putting that gun in your mouth and pulling the trigger trust me itll be fun
That is demonic behaviour. Praying to the Good Lord you made this up.
Nice one

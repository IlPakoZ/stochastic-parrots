Because the goal was never to occupy and colonize those lands, but to win the hearts and minds of the civilians, and support the formation of a democratic government while killing communists and terrorists.

Nooo but you just don't understand if they provide public healthcare then you will get le tax increase and it will be worse somehow!!
Meanwhile they pay more than they would with a tax increase because of medical insurance middlemen. Math is something Amerimutts struggle with.

because the people are cucked and distracted by the telescreen and muh culture war to fuel their rage. Since 1971 the two parties have been growing ever further apart from each other and it is hitting a breaking point.

The Multiparty Democracy Act
Section 1: Findings and Purpose
(a) Findings - The People find the following:
(1) The two-party system has dominated United States politics since the early 19th century, preventing the equitable representation of diverse political ideologies and limiting the scope of political discourse.
(2) Many democracies around the world successfully operate with multiparty systems, resulting in more accurate representation of constituent voices.
(3) The adoption of a multiparty system will help to reduce factionalism, promote political pluralism, and encourage bipartisan cooperation.
(b) Purpose - The purpose of this Act is to abolish the two-party system in the United States in favor of a multiparty system, thereby enhancing democratic representation and fostering a more inclusive political landscape.
Section 2: Definitions
(a) Major Party - Any political party that has held a continuous majority or near majority of seats in either the House of Representatives or the Senate within the last two election cycles.
(b) Minor Party - Any political party that has not held a continuous majority or near majority of seats in either the House of Representatives or the Senate within the last two election cycles.
(c) Multiparty System - A system of governance in which multiple distinct political parties have the opportunity to gain representation in government and to form consistent competitive coalitions.
Section 3: Outlawing the Two-Party System
(a) Major Party Dominance - No single major party or any two major parties combined shall control more than 60% of the total seats in either the House of Representatives or the Senate.
(b) Anti-Collusion Measures - Major parties shall be prohibited from forming political alliances or electoral pacts which undermine the establishment of a multiparty system.

Section 4: Promoting Multiparty Representation
(a) Electoral Reform - Congress shall enact legislation to reform the electoral process to facilitate the growth and representation of minor parties by:
(1) Implementing ranked-choice voting in federal elections. (2) Eliminating or reducing restrictive ballot access laws. (3) Redrawing districts to prevent gerrymandering or adopting alternative voting methods, such as proportional representation or single transferable vote systems.
(b) Campaign Finance Reform - Congress shall enact legislation to provide equal and transparent campaign financing opportunities to all political parties, including minor parties, to enable fair competition within the political process.
Section 5: Implementation and Enforcement
(a) Implementation - This Act shall be implemented within two election cycles following its enactment.
(b) Enforcement - The Federal Election Commission shall enforce the provisions of this Act and develop guidelines for its proper execution. Failure by any political party to adhere to the terms of this Act may result in penalties, including but not limited to, fines and a loss of ballot access.
Section 6: Severability
If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Act and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

How the fuck is gerrymandering even legal? US "democracy" is a joke.

Haihai, but we do live in the era of post-irony, and so the real joke is writing laws and sending them to congresspeople.

North Vietnam had an actual, proper military with trained, well equipped, professional soldiers. Furthermore, apart from ample material and intelligence support, the USSR and Red China both pressured the US to limit its actions in North Vietnam, lest they escalate the situation as well. Even then, the US Military achieved a highly favorable K/D of around 10. America's loss in Vietnam was not military, which is why Saigon didn't fall until around two years after they finally pulled out completely, but was caused by their inability to ever stabilize South Vietnam into a functional, stable and self sustaining country that could resist North Vietnam on its own. The French, Diem and wave after wave of coups from greedy generals kinda soured the South Vietnamese on the concept of democracy and Western values. 
How the fuck is gerrymandering even legal?
Because the party in power doesn't want to change things, because that would jeopardize their ability to remain in power. If and when the situation changes and you get another party in power, they will simply gerrymander in their own favor, probably while claiming to "fix" the gerrymandering of the previous party. Government will never self limit, no matter the type. It's just not how people work. It's not a US problem either, in Canada the conservatives won the popular vote by total votes, but ended up with fewer seats due to gerrymandering. I'm sure it's the same all over the world.

We turned from God. That is the source of all our problems, a tale as old as Rome.

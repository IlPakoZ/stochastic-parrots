This board as of late feels like a desert, with a few evil spirits dwelling in it and a few scattered human souls being tormented by them and occasionally presenting their own threads. There's a feeling of permanent silence, waiting for something to be said, questioning if the things that are said actually needed to be said. Like an empty, insecure, silent depression. The soul of r9k has been destroyed, from tear and wear, and from a more mature take on life, and a little timid baby has been reborn, but it came back into the void/desert, so what can it do?

I just want to feel cherished, desired, valued, even if just as a pet and a fucktoy. I want to be able to stop thinking and trust someone, put my life in her hands. I want a girl to tear down the barriers i've constructed around my ego and self-respect and make me feel secure no matter what i say and do- that's liberating submission.
What do you want from femdom, robots?
feeling desired is the big one yeah. I don't really like "femdom" because online the porn of it just seems like its about pleasing the man. I'm much more interested in purely just servicing the woman and getting slapped around/degraded a bit
my captcha said gay in it lol
I don't really like the getting degraded or beat up aspects of it so I guess that for me it is entirely about feeling desired for once in my life.
I don't because I have an ounce of respect for myself. Only pathetic, loser men bow down to the whims of women and become their subservient.
I want a woman that's willing to play into my perverse need to be looked at with inscrutable contempt. She can hurt me a little too.
To be vulnerable with someone I can trust.
a damn hug
Idk about femdom. 
I care a lot about her pleasure and being desired is a massive rurn on. 
Call me a good boy, let me pleasure you, nice cuddles, and let me rest my head on your tits. 
I want more of an equally dominant and submissive dynamic in bed. Sometimes me, sometimes her. 
Lots of snacks and staying inside.
someone who likes me and cares about me and gets turned on by causing pain and distress to me but also loves that I do that for her and make her feel powerful and good, and I would like to serve her and see her succeed and thrive and be a wonderful strong woman whom I and everyone else admires.
i think i want femdom to reassure my self-deprecation of being a loser and a shallow reason to feel wanted

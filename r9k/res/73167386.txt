What would it take for you to date a guy? How could he be good enough for you?
Did you mean to make a Bare Minimum Standards thread instead?
FUCK THAT PIC MAKES ME DIAMONDS
implying a low self-esteem chick doesn't consider a piece of shit ideal
Assuming you mean minimum standards:
Male
Likes me
Looking at him does not viscerally repulse me
I would say "not fat" but I've sunk so low as to date fats before so I'd probably do it again if lonely enough
no idea desu.
the only bf i've ever had was obsessed with me and treated me like a princess but i realized i'd never be able to live with him bc he acted too much like a man.
like i don't mean he was super masculine or anything, he just did normal guy stuff and said certain things that made me realize he had such a moid pov about the world and i just knew it would be torturous to live with.
i'm not a lesbo tho i think i just have a lot of deep-rooted misandry.
Do you want a guy with some less manly interests like flowers and art?
Fat women usually have a smell. Is that the case with fat men too?
deep seated misandry 
And I have deep seated misogyny. We can have deep passionate hate sex before we try to murder each other (I would win obviously)
Let's find out. ComicCon, here we come!
Fat women usually have a smell. Is that the case with fat men too?
Yes. At least, one did. The other concealed it fairly well. But the one that smelled, after a while I just couldn't take it, it was a major factor in breaking up
Looking at him does not viscerally repulse me
Acnebros... we lost... it's over...
said certain things that made me realize he had such a moid pov
give an example
So... ideally you'd want a turbo femme gay dude or hsts tranny but who still prefers women for some reason? Good luck I guess.
no, i like men.
ideally i'd want someone to give me affection and dick that keeps his mouth shut and whose only opinions are my opinions.
he was upset when i said that short guys were gross and creepy because he didn't understand the "ick" and tried to make it out like i was discriminating when i was just stating fact.
The fuck am I reading?
Oh nvm you're just a bitch
Someone who loves me deeply, is kind, is attentive, nerdy, has a warm smile, kind, gives me lots of hugs and affection, smart, makes me laugh and smile, and will let me smooch him a thousand times over :)
I think it's a bait.. because there's no way she didn't shame that moid harder, what a pussy, of course women find manlets disgusting, what kind of question is that
Check the post times. You've been fooled by a faker.
youre pathetic, and I say this as a woman
Dang. Too pure.
And what are your opinions?
post titties
You want nerdy chad
Who on earth is chad why do you people mention him so often
idk just stupid things. like if i would gossip w him about some shitty thing my friend's bf did he would be too defensive of him. like bro why are you defending the honor of some guy you never met when said guy was caught lying and going to nightclubs w his friends? and then i realized its bc men will always side with men and it seriously annoyed me.
i dont even care about height?? i was almost taller than him.
No but I will post a cute cat and an awesome song :D

All foids who dont post titties should be banned and designated as trannys
that's lame you should post feetsies
thank you good sir have an awesome day :D
Taylor hasn't ever been cowboy. I like her first four albums when she was cowboy-adjacent, but come on.
be a handsome famous rich korean man with a good personality 
otherwise id just rather be alone and simp for them from afar 
im too spoiled to settle for less now
 Be secure
 Have hobbies
Now you don't care if you pull hoes
I hope you end up kidnapped and murdered for having these delusions. What Korean would ruin his genetic purity with your mutt shit?
I do value my body so no, plus why do you want to see some randos body parts?
I'm so mentally ill and anxious it would probably take years of friendship for me to be comfortable enough and by that point they're either not interested in me or I've seen enough of their negatives to think they aren't worth putting any time in to.
shhhhh shh shh I love her older albums too, speak now is quite literally her apex but this song is so much more than that. You should really check out folklore and evermore they are just, so beautiful
TRANNY DEFLECTION
mods, ban this pretender immediately. 
why?
Because no tits equals no opinion allowed
No more Taylor :D
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RsEZmictANA&amp;pp=ygUTd2lsbG93IHRheWxvciBzd2lmdA%3D%3D [Embed]
If I was a mentally ill man in a dress, Id already be like 6 feet under with the rest of them lol
I already listened to Folklore and Evermore. They washed over me and left nothing behind, like water off an umbrella. The music is fine, it wasn't unpleasant, I could listen to it whenever a person with me wants to play it, but I wouldn't on my own because I'm just not that into pop. Have we already had this conversation?
Hmmmm okay you are based I suppose. No tits needed. (For now)
Do you want a man who is very masculine physically but willing to completely submit to you?
Hmmmm I only come here like once a month or two so probably not? But maybe I dunno, Im kind of loosing interest in this place :(
I used to not like them as much but I dunno theyve really grown on me
we would make beautiful hapa babies together &lt;3
Silly poster, it's spelt "attractive", not "attentive"! It's an easy mistake to make, I understand.
Ive never dated but I completely understand the deep rooted misandry thing. It honestly ruined a lot of things in my life, including the relationship with my male family members, socializing and my mental health. I cant even see real men as attractive anymore, no matter how handsome and/or cool they are. 
Anyways, at this point I just need 2D. I cant want to be plugged to the computer for eternity and lead a happy life or actually a thousand different lives not to get bored. I want to custom my looks to perfection each time and then go for certain anime men I already find perfect as they are. Thats the only dating plan I have for myself. 
Just sucks that I dont know if I wont kill myself before technology gets there.
beautiful hapa babies
Exhibit 1
-Not fat
-Not ugly
-Taller than me, which is easy
-More or less same music taste
-Preferably similar clothing style
-Must want children
-Must like animals
-Ready to settle down and start a family but cool with taking time off for concerts and date nights
-Not a loser (example using memes irl, trying to hard)
Hey thats me! ORIGINALLY
 Be secure
what does this mean?
Lmao when your 2d husband wants to kill and abuse you just like regular men do. What then? The breakdown you will have will be hilarious
More or less same music taste
don't know what it is
Must like animals
shit
concerts
lol it's over
It means dont backtalk whenever she wants to do something you dont like aka being her bitch. Dont let them fool you.
But maybe I dunno, Im kind of loosing interest in this place :(
I'm happy for you, and I hope you manage to escape permanently soon.
Fearless is my favorite album because it's the furthest she matured as an artist in pop country, which is where I wish she could have stayed, or at least produced more. I might have become an actual "fan" if she had continued progressing in that direction. Second place is Red, the furthest she matured as an artist in pop rock. Pop rock's not quite my thing, but I respect it as an accomplishment for what she was trying to do. Behind that I value her self-titled album, which wasn't perfect, but was a strong debut with an immediate identity of its own. You say that Speak Now was her best, but I say that it was only her fourth best, as it was only transitional, in between genres, without really much of its own identity. You can hate me for this if you want. I will take your hatred and live with it.
Off the top of my head, I remember liking
Should Have Said No
Jump Then Fall
Fifteen
Hey Stephen
The Best Day
Mean
Superman
State of Grace
I Bet You Think About Me
but then for Pop Taylor, the only songs I really remember liking are
Anti-Hero
You're On Your Own, Kid
and everything else is just a blur. Pop just ain't my thing. Taylor Swift just ain't my thing... but in another timeline, with a different direction for her career, she could have been my thing.
And she ain't cowboy.
i lost at the last fucking one and maybe the music taste one too (who knows) 
anyways with my typing style you could tell regardless but i would never use memes irl
He has to be like the guy on the right in picrel.
NTA but Elliot was half jewish and half malaysian (WMAF) and raised in an extremely dysfunctional household by two narcissistic parents.
Fuckkkk im legit stpid
That's me, I'm invisible.
That's me, I'm invisible.
stop
Overdid it, this killed the good bait string you had going.
I really don't understand women into koreans
narcissistic parents
Yes, fembot would either turn her kid into a tranny or a school shooter.
Do women like dinner at home or only take out?
I mean depends. I said a thousand lives. Some of my favorite anime men will be abusive af. But switching to a different life for some aftercare will balance it out. I dont mind being abused by characters I like, its a hot fantasy. I just know they are characters and not real people. Real abusive men are repulsive and no fun. Thats why real dating is not for me. I dont think I could ever form a real relationship where you need to trust the other party and lose a good chunk of control you have over the situation. 
Also why are you being mean for no reason?
why are you being mean?
Because i have deep rooted misogyny and I hate foids
yikes and yup 
me and nyeongie would be the best parents, we would love our quiverfull family and only produce model tier children &lt;3
model tier children
For the make a wish foundation when they die of cancer from your mutt genes
i wont have sex with you, sorry anon
Neither does any korean man want you, femcel. Back to the basement for you
Kek okay then. Have a good one
thats fine, men and women inherently dont seem to understand what the other one likes, its one of the great mysteries of life. 
ew no, cope.
I like treating women like property.
If you are here, you are definitely deranged and kpopman would have his security kill you on sight
im not a femcel. ive rejected a lot of men before because they werent good enough for me. 
anyway, i will get a rich famous handsome korean husband one day, i believe in myself and am manifesting it ^_^
manifesting
Definitely a femcel. Just the foid version of coping. Waiting for your eventual hanging when you get rejected by your supposed true Korean love. Less mutt genes in the world
realize i love him back, to not be fearful of other men trying to get in the way of our love. by coming back be open to maybe getting married (OR NOT hahaha whaaaat) and starting a family of our own including pets. unapologetically nerdy and sends me poetry, takes care of me and cries with me, makes me food and kisses me in trees. okay with me not being able to drive. let's me draw on his freckled back and hug constellations.
i really wish i were a korean guy so i could get kidnapped and impregnate femcels against my will
That was a weird movie. I watched on encyclopedia d.
pic rel has got to be the most degenerate fucking thing i have ever seen a foid post
kpopman will fall in love with me at first sight. even joongi, who is one of the most famous wealthy actors in korea, is dating some random quite average british woman, so i have no doubt nyeongie will fall for me &lt;3 
cope seethe mald and dilate, incel :)
Huh? Why is it degenerate?
Are you Russian or just a fan of her art?
So you want a cuck
i will make nyeongie give me at least 15 kids
big if true >>73162177 
gluck
Kpop chad isnt real, he's like an anime waifu
quite average british girl
Average femcel behavior to put down an obvious Stacy who is better than you in every way
C C C COPE! 
Thats you everyday without kpopman
You need to be over 18 to post here
ORIGINAL ORIGINAL ORIGINAL
um sweaty, if you think thats a stacy then im a gigastacy, oof 
ikr, almost too good to be true. hes my irl anime husbando &lt;3
Ohhhh, we have talked!!!!! Thats sooo awesome, I actually smiled so hard realizing that. You are awesome, serendipity is awesome :D 
Awww and dont worry! I only come here very rarely anyways. I mean im pretty opposite from like 99% of users here anyways, I initially came here on the assumption everyone here would be super smart and interesting. And while there are some people who are very smart and nice, I think the majority should deefinitely lessen the porn addiction. 
Ah yes i remember you saying all of that. And gosh Id never get mad over something as silly as that haha! Its perfectly a okay :) I definitely do love all of those albums but I just enjoy speak now the most. Better than revenge, innocent, last kiss, dear John, all absolute favorites within her discography. Especially for better than revenge, I love that punk rock inspired early 2000s vibe she had. If she ever released a rock album i feel like id ascend to the sky. Based on midnights aesthetic I was reaaaally hoping for a 70s rock fleetwood Mack esque album buuut im happy with what I got. Wouldve couldve shouldve is one of my favorite Taylor songs. It tears my heart out :( 
Honestly I love pop Taylor but I like every genre of music, just a preference to rock and metal. New Romantics has made me so much happier and unchained, and like Taylor said in the song, the best people in life are free :) 
Im curious, what kind of music do you like? :0 
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
She may not be a real cowboy, but shes a lyrical one. Taking over the Wild West of music with poetic lines as ammo!
No, I made no spelling mistakes you silly goose.
Why do you talk like an AI generated randum xD chick from 2008. Kys boomer roastie.
The delusions are getting stronger. Back to the psych ward
Fembots are all disgusting masochist hideous skanks who want Chad looking edgy school shooters who will abuse and rape them. They are trash and its no wonder they only attract trash.
In 2008, uhhhhhh lets just I was in elementary school haha, waaay younger than you buddy. Dont wanna say something I shouldnt lol. 
I have no idea what on earth youre talkin about but good for you!
we would make beautiful hapa babies together
This is ok as long as you abort the male ones
i am based and cool
he is not :( i have had exes into that but have not bitten the bullet
i am originally yes
This. Never date a girl from here. They are all either trannies, annoying boring npc moralfags whose only hobby is playing stardew valley and shit talking people, or edgy drug addicted cat killing whores with cluster b. 
If you think incels and robots are shit them you are not prepared for what shit humans fembots are. Not only that but they are all ugly and flat/brickmode or obese, and the rare 0.1% who are actually attractive are the worst most insane psychotic cunts with a discord sever full of 10K simps imaginable.
The heckin wholesome fembot act is tedious, shut up dumb cunt.
whoops i am
i am based and cool
Dominant fembots are cringe, you are all dysphoric low self esteem failed FTMs who like being raped and choked and getting painal by Chad just like every other whore, but have fantasies about abusing your beta simps
Fuck you nigger you have no soul
Shut up you fake wholesome haha xD cunt, everyone can see through the act
thread about ideal men
fembots list their ideal men
scrotes immediately chimp out and REEEEEEEE NOOOOOO
Why are they like this, sisters? Why did god make them annoying mentally ill idiots as well as ugly?
i've never met a fembot who fantasized about dominating simps instead of chads... but if there any, i'm interseted
awesome sauce thanks, im also not a bot or whatever its called. I just come here out of curiosity. I really hope you can move on from bullying random people on the internet, youre better than that. I truly do. Thats all I will ever say to you, have an awesome life. Goodbye
Why are they like this, sisters?
sisters
Ive met and talked to a few. They say they are dommes and try to act edgy and dominant, but when you talk to them a bit longer it turns out they are submissive Chad-shit eating turdwhores who like being slapped and raped and choked just like all other women.
goes on a board notoriously filled with lonely men
has to see posts from lonely men
OMG WHAT WHO COULD DO THIS TO 4CHAN OF ALL PLACES
awesome sauce
pls no bully 
have an awesome life
Shut up you passive aggressive NPC turdwhore.
I think the majority should deefinitely lessen the porn addiction.
I think this website needs a blue SFW /r9k/, or even a blue SFW /soc/. I just want someplace to talk to people about life and love and loneliness without having pornography shoved in my face all over the catalog. It'll never happen though. And that's why leaving is a good thing.
Here's a couple 3x3s for my tastes. For country specifically, I grew up with what I thought was country, but looking back it was just country rock. When it comes to modern country I have an affinity more for the "progressive bluegrass"-y side. My country mainstays are Alison Krauss, Crooked Still, the Dixie Chicks, Johnny Cash, Nickel Creek, and Railroad Earth. But my actual favorite music is 1960s folk rock. Bob Dylan, Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and then Paul Simon's solo career up through the modern era. What type of rock do you listen to usually?
The hard part of leaving /r9k/ (or 4chan, if I manage to make it that far) is figuring out what to do with your time. I know I should be working harder on my book backlog and my movie backlog. What should you be doing instead of being here?
Nobody asked you to post in a thread which is SPECIFICALLY about fembots ideal types, retard. If youre gonna piss and moan about women finding hot guys hot then x off the tab and move on with your sad pathetic little life.
that's great but i've never gotten them to even talk about anything sexual. i don't understand how chads like you do it
Omg look at me, I listen to 70s dadrock, I am so heckin different from other girls! XD 
Neck yourself turdwhore.
Why did god make them annoying mentally ill idiots as well as ugly?
ikr. like pick a struggle.
Sweetheart if you're gonna piss and moan about a completely normal /r9k/ thread then maybe go back to R*ddit? There are subs that man men iirc, you can have your echo chamber there.
he is not a cuck 
i am not a cheating whore :3 not fantasy, is real. i can have just one simp and some baby simps. as we hold hands in missionary
Stop being a cringe whore cunt.
I would rather see your throat slashed, Faggot. 
Sounds like a cuck
You originally on east coast?
You are probably some insecure fat neckbeard called Cooper or some nasty Indian manlet. No wonder women talking about superior men makes you seethe so much.
I heart that people born in 2000 or later don't have souls. Is it true that you don't have a soul?
you stop being a cringe whore cunt :33
Its perfectly normal to feel that way. I like the way some moids look, but I dont like male energy. Its heavy, depressive, boring, overbearing, bossy and suffocating, I genuinely hate being around guys irl and listening to them talk, even if they are good looking. Even the droning sound of their voices is annoying.
I like the way some moids look
t-thanks. if i was a fembot's gf i would not speak unless i had permission
Me and who? (I am the 3rd step from the bottom)
WAH WAH WAH seethe
Does not change the fact that I want you cut into pieces and boiled in a barrel.
how is he cuck, you projector >>73168599
this lol, what stupid copper
We need separate gender spaces right now. Or allow men and women to fight and kill each other. If you hate males so much, dont be in male spaces
Youre the one who wants other men in your relationship, kike.
i hate men too, because im not a stacy they treat me like shit on their shoe. i wish a virus would kill everyone with the Y chromosome. 
failing that, i wish everything was segregated by gender and moids and trannies werent allowed in any womens spaces. if you are a woman all moids do is judge you on whether you are fuckable or not, and if you arent fuckable they treat you like garbage. and they think all women and girls are just there to rape. im sick of having to share sidewalks, cafes, transport, public spaces with them. there should be a moid apartheid.
woman says men are annoying
moid solution is lets all kill each other
the Y chromosome should genuinely be considered a disability at this point
I can fall in love with almost anyone as long as I think they have soul because I am overtly romantic and out of touch with reality, but for someone to marry and start a family it would be same race, religion, and looksmatch so 4/10 maybe. I don't really know my rating, I'm below average looks but not ugly enough for anyone to notice me.
Yes, foid. That is my solution.
yep men want me 
i exist yo ho fiddley dee
being a pirate's the life for me
Glad a foid agrees with me. Id rather fight to the death against foids than share a space with cunts ever again.
If you hate males so much, dont be in male spaces
the irony of this statement when moids and moid failmales (trannies) are constantly invading womens spaces to rape and harass them. kill yourself scrote.
Since I was a little kid and watched this one episode of Fairly OddParents where they separated womens and mens worlds, Ive never wanted anything more. I truly want to never see any men ever again.
Hope you end up on the news when your bf kills you
What race and religion are you?
men invading foid spaces to kill and rape them 
Good.
sounds based im gonna watch it right now 
men should be seen and not heard and only attractive ones should be allowed to exist for the female gaze in controlled enclosures like animals in a zoo
the ugly incel ones should either be euthanized or carted off to work camps where they do labor 24/7 to provide taxes for women to live without ever having to work
moid holocaust 
My dream.
you are late to the party then
Glad to see the hatred is shared between males and foids. I want to see foids treated like cartel executions on a daily basis
This is a very dedicated LARP
Someone needs a hug
Oh you are dead already? Another W for the men. Rest in piss
moid ideal world m is just mindless retarded destruction instead of a based functional matriarchal utopia
Failmale detected.
Woaaaah, honestly I havent listened to a lot of these. Which is so awesome because id love to gain new music, so thank you :) im really happy, this is why I love talking to people about music. I just learn so much. What do you think are some good beginner songs to get into that genre? Could ya recommend me some, Ive really wanted to branch out buutt, it is a little intimidating. 
Ohh, and you must be young right? I was born after those newer albums were released so youre older than me buuut thats cool! Howd you get introduced to music and your favorites? Im always so curious:) 
For me my favorite songs right now are:

Ive got waaaay more but thatd be excessive haha, sorry! Im just so passionate haha :) 
I dont really have my favorite albums set up but last fm tells you your favorite artists so heres mine from last year
You can always be a slave where your only use is getting raped.
Mitski
Lana del Ray
Red flag, BPD whore detected. Dropped.
Nono very opposite problem, I have too much soul. I feel too much
sorry? I certainly dont have bpd or whatever, music is just music
Not important it is datamining and I will never get a /r9k/ boyfriend I would rather get one from another 4chan board than /r9k/ if I had to. For now I cope with being delusional and fantasizing about my oneitis.
a thread about fembots' preferences gets completely flooded with people arguing with them and simps
Like clockwork.
Whoopsie Daisy haha I forgot to include this but yeah absolutely this place would be greatly improved by that. I do plan on quitting permanently eventually buuut its interesting to see social media if it didnt have the draconian restrictions of other places. 
Oh thats awesome thats awesome. What kind of books and movies do you have backed up? I know I certainly have a ton haha! And for things I should be doing, hmmm. I definitely love to sew a lot (someone miiight recognize me from this) I really like cooking, gardening, getting gifts for people I love, music is obviously a given haha, singing too! I also just love 1950s related stuff and vintage aesthetics.
men are retarded monkeys, what did you expect
Are you white? Thats all I wanna know. 
And yeah I wouldnt recommend dating anyone from this board.
Amateurs. Make women simp for you.
I will listen to all of these, and I will tell you what I think of them... never. Because I'm leaving /r9k/ and you're leaving /r9k/. And That's A Good Thing. But I did just listen to your Flamingos now and they were still great.
I think you're missing out if you don't listen to albums. Many of your favorite singles take on new meanings if you listen in their proper context.
Could ya recommend me some, Ive really wanted to branch out buutt, it is a little intimidating. 
I'm starting with Fleetwood Mac because you like Fleetwood Mac. Here's the Dixie Chicks singing Fleetwood Mac.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxTl3UgYbhg [Embed]
When you listen to it on the album, it's sandwiched between these two songs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c5b8ZtjwwY [Embed]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKx3coz3G7c [Embed]
You would miss out on these if you didn't listen to albums.
You've listened to Bob Dylan before, I assume, but here's a couple songs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHG06Q45ziI [Embed]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb4PsXncNV8 [Embed]
so that you can hear these same songs covered by Nickel Creek
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93E8vCg5RA0 [Embed]
and covered by Crooked Still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C4g8sMVbIM [Embed]
Simon &amp; Garfunkel also sang Bob Dylan before their big hit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fWyzwo1xg0 [Embed]
and then they made a song for a movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C1BCAgu2I8 [Embed]
but then they fought too much and broke up in 1970, the same year as the Beatles, after one last album
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3LFML_pxlY [Embed]
while reuniting occasionally over the years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Ro3eGuznI [Embed]
but mainly Art Garfunkel faded into obscurity while Paul Simon continued to shine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP6a-7MP91g [Embed]
But back to albums. If you haven't listened to this already, it is your DUTY as a 4channer to listen to this #1 /mu/ meme at least once from start to finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LULmbLlPvVk&amp;list=PLT-5qio7h5jSzEOsTjOVGMgVi5nce5lAl [Embed]
he like my piss
checkmate
Ohhh wait nonono I dont wanna loose contact with you. I can give you my discord? Or my email? Please please, I really enjoyed speaking with ya! 
Ill go ahead and take a listen to these! A few of them I do recognize but Im excited :D
Howd you get introduced to music and your favorites?
I got into country as a little kid when my nanny would play the local country music radio station. They just played whatever was popular at the time, not the classics. I'm still ignorant about the classics.
So I never got to hear stuff like this on the radio

I got into folk rock in high school when I started listening to my parents' music collection, so here's a song about parents and children.

How did you get into metal? I'm not opposed to metal, but it's completely foreign to me. I like chill and relaxing music, so I never got into anything harsh and loud.
What kind of books and movies do you have backed up?
I want to try out the detective/mystery/crime genre, so I have a few Agatha Christie books and a Nero Wolfe title on my list for 2023. I also want to read more autobiographical memoirs to broaden my horizons, because I mostly read fiction and not much non-fiction. For movies I like foreign film and really old movies. 1970s, 1960s, 19540s, 1940s, 1930s... that's the stuff for me.
You know what? We've actually spoken previously. We were talking about your interest in the 1950s, and I mentioned some 1950s movies I had seen recently, and you thought I was recommending them, and you left the thread before I could tell you that I wasn't recommending them, and before I could tell you what my actual favorites were. How dare you?
I think I just smiled an ever bigger smile than before, whaaaat! I know you from so much!!! Thats soooo cooooo!!!! Oh my god I am so happy somehow we always see each other :D maybe were just destined to talk to one another hahaha! Whats the probability of this happening so much oh my gosh. Im sorry im just stupidly happy this is awesome. 
Awwww I see thats a very sweet story :)
I liked some folk but veerry contemporary haha, I too know nothing about the classics! 
Awww I really liked it thank you :)
I went through a period of pretty heavy depression and emptiness when quarantine happened. I couldnt really feel anything for a while, and everything became grey sludge. I found metal, more so nu-metal, specifically my freshman year. I had only listened to dreamscape music, alternative pop, pop, and a little bit of indie at that point so it was startling. I didnt really enjoy it at first. But as I got better and became much happier, I fell really in love with deftones and nu-metal. 
The big thing for me is the exhilaration, the emotion, the thrill, the adrenaline, the passion I feel from metal and rock. It makes me feel alive, it helped me awake from that catatonic coma esque state I had been in during quarantine. I just love music that excites me. I have absolutely no interested in vices like drinking, or drugs, or promiscuity. I guess you could consider me more on the traditional side haha. Buuut I find my feelings of freedom through music.
I also lile metal because 1) I feel like an eldritch god HAHA 2) and because i grew up so sheltered and helpless it makes me feel so powerful. 
monster by skillet and heart shaped box by nirvana were rock songs I listened to as a child so you could say I technically diiid always have in interest in it. 
Im so sorryyyy :( these threads always close so early! I mean to respond but by the time I wake up theyre gone :( 
Im sorry, and you can absolutely give me you real recommendations. Id love to see them :)
I'm glad we could have one more meeting before you leave /r9k/ and before I leave /r9k/. I hope you understand why I won't be able to talk with you in private. You guessed right that I'm older. Too old for /r9k/. So this conversation is as far as it goes. But it's nice to run into interesting people by random chance, because it gives you hope for the future that random chance might strike again.
Just three movie recommendations this time, restricting myself only to movies that I've seen in 2023:
Marty (1955) - The best 1950s film I've seen in 2023, and any other film I can recommend wouldn't be from the 1950s, so what's the point?
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) - A movie that's colorful and musical and aesthetic, so I think you're going to love it... but it's in French.
West Side Story (1961) - A movie that's colorful and musical and aesthetic, so I think you're going to love it... but I wish the ending had been more Shakespearean.
I'm glad metal was able to comfort you when life was rotten. I hope metal continues to be enjoyable as your life continues to improve, and I hope things only go up from here. It was good seeing you again, now take care and be well.

What's the point of a girlfriend when it seems like they pretty much have nothing in common with men, and never will?
you can have sex and not be a faggot and (probably) not get std's
To have sex and multiply 
Duh
The point is to say I HAVE A GF no really thats thats the point
That's a pretty reductive way of thinking of things. There are plenty of women out there who will share the same interests as you, and will be very pleasant to be around. The only downside is you will never meet them, and will likely only ever encounter shallow women that can't fit your needs. You'd then need to decide whether you want to be with a woman who makes you unhappy (but sometimes makes you a little happy), or be alone forever.
But they seem to have absolutely nothing in common on a fundamental level. The way they do the things you also do is different. I don't know maybe this is a me thing. I haven't had friends since middle school and back then we hung out because we all played pokemon. There wasn't much to it.
There's women who will have things in common with you. They'll like the same things as you, they'll have the same political views as you, they'll have the personality to motivate you to accomplish your goals. They're also probably shut ins or workaholics and you'll never meet them. Men and women are supposed to be different on some level, they have strengths and weaknesses that compliment each other.
You want me to start posting black psychos from the inner city dating white suburb living girls who would have nada in common with them?

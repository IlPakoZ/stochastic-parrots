I like to /sniff/
I want to get picrel and sniff those spices mixed with the smokey wood it should be a treat
What smells do you anons /sniff/
What reminds you of home
Banana bread
hand sanitizers and colognes. with the colognes ive found its better to spritz them into a small plastic bag and go nuts
gasoline seems too far anon
I hate women but goddamn do I love how they can leave a trail of nice smell when they walk by you outdoors. It trips me out since they are competing with all the ventilation of the air around me and beating it. I know for a fact my farts don't smell when I am outside because air currents defeats the smell but women a yard or two away can walk by me outside and their perfume and whatever is lingering in the air. I can't figure out how they do it 
Honeysuckle is nice. Also the smell of cooked meat when walking near restaurant district
Turbovirgin incel mass shooter vibe here
I love when I walk by somebody that smells really good male or female it feels intimate
Cigarette smoke is probably my favorite smell. I don't smoke myself, though, because it's far too expensive where I live. 
I am also fond of the smell of wet paint.
Those logs don't really work, I tried them, I like the smell of beer usually, though I never drink.

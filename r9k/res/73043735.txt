what time do you have dinner?
Whenever I get hungry.
<comment>
I have dinner at 12 o'clock if you mean tea I eat that at around 6-7 o'clock.

Most of those make sense to me except Spain. Like do they all get out of bed at noon to be eating that fucking late?
<comment>
yes im sure all european countries have dinner in the morning
<comment>
Spain has lots of Sun hours and a pretty hot climate so most people wait until the the Sun isn't too hot to start doing their routine unless they have to work
<comment>
Around 6

Good to know Spain is inhabited by psychopaths

Fucking disgusting subhuman northerner, I hate you and your goblin kind. I wish we'd never shut the mines so we could keep you down there where you belong.

What time do you go to bed? If you go to bed at what I'd consider a normal time (10-12 ish?) and wake up 8 hours later, that seems like quite a long time without food. Do you have large breakfasts?
<comment>
About 7:30-8:00 but sometimes as late as 9 some days.
<comment>
When I feel like cooking, clocks are for wagies
<comment>
Anywhere between 5 and 8 depending on what time I wake up
<comment>
Dinner?
Isn't those times for breakfast?
<comment>
4:30-5pm typically
<comment>
What time do you go to bed?
Normal time like you say, 10-12. We have this thing called "kveldsmat" ("food of the evening") before we go to bed, so dinner is often not the last meal of the day in Norway. Food culture is very weak here, hardly anyone knows how to cook, especially my studentfag peers. 
Do you have large breakfasts?
No, breakfast and lunch are normal sized here.

Fasting for a minimum of 12 hours between your dinner and breakfast is excellent for complete digestion of food. It will also promote sound sleep and help to maintain the cardinal rhythm of the body.
The goal is to eat every 3 to 4 hours in order to keep your blood sugar consistent and for your stomach to optimally digest. Setting this schedule consistently across days can also help curb overeating which can lead to bloating or indigestion.

'evening meal'
wat? isn't first meal of day breakfast, lunch, then last meal dinner?
<comment>
For everywhere in the English speaking world, yes. For the gremlin-esque creatures of northern England, it goes breakfast -> dinner -> tea. In fairness to them, dinner was historically the largest meal of the day, which is why you might have a Sunday dinner at around midday, and would still call that dinner.

5-6 most days

dinner (n.)
c. 1300, "first big meal of the day" (eaten between 9 a.m. and noon), from Old French disner "breakfast" (11c.), noun use of infinitive disner (Modern French diner) "take the first meal of the day," from Gallo-Roman *desiunare "to break one's fast," from Vulgar Latin *disieiunare, from dis- "undo, do the opposite of" (see dis-) + Late Latin ieiunare, jejunare "to fast," from Latin ieiunus "fasting, hungry, not partaking of food" (see jejune)
jejune (adj.)
1610s, "dull in the mind, flat, insipid, wanting in interest," from Latin ieiunus "empty, dry, barren," literally "fasting, hungry," a word of obscure origin. De Vaan finds it to be from a PIE root meaning "to worship, reverence," hence "to sacrifice" (with cognates including Sanskrit yajati "to honor, worship, sacrifice," Avestan yaza- "to worship," Greek agios, agnos "holy;" see hagio-), and writes that the Latin word and its relatives "would be based on the habit to perform the first sacrifice of the day on an empty stomach." Related: jejunal; jejunally.

whenever i'm hungry
<comment>
we take naps, where do you think the siesta in toros y siesta comes from
<comment>
Unironically wrong.
In most parts of the world "dinner" refers to midday meal.
Thus proper line-up is "breakfast-dinner-supper"
Lunch was supposed to mean light in between snack when you're peckish.
But amerifats in their infinite gluttony made light snack into proper meal, thus actual amerifat line-up goes "breakfast -lunch-dinner-omg I woke up at 2am and devoured half the fridge and am now so ashamed I want to die".
Obviously amerifats will never admit that last mealtime exist, but we all know the truth.

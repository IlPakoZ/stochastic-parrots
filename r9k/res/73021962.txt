As the title says. Can fembots be orbiters to men off of r9k? Has it ever happened? Can it even happen? Is there even enough fembots on here for that to be a possibility?
off r9k? nah. not possible. but i've orbited several of my IRL male friends
maybe if he was super cute
ive had a girl simp before
she bought me minecraft
I miss being a simp.
you can buy me minecraft too if you want
But u already have it
I got minecraft the other day and still havent opened it
Yes it happens more often than you think, but likely not on r9k, due to it being a generally terrible environment for meeting people.
Yea. But when they do it they are "smart" about it to the extent that they will use every resource in their network to find out about every single thing about you without you ever knowing. 
Or so they think.
Men and women can avoid it simply asking how many people they chat with in an average day. If it's over 3 I never waste my time.

tonight's the day my father turned sixty-something
honestly don't remember and it's not important
woke up at around 1 pm because of knocking at the door, get out of bed and come see what it is, dad barges in with bags in hand, mom behind him similarly carrying shit
they set the bags down in the kitchen, pulling alcohol, fastfood and canned goods, setting everything onto the table
i ask what's up and get berated in response for forgetting the most important day of the year and get reminded of how much of a piece of shit i am, just tiredly mozey over back to bed instead of piping up at them
wake up a couple of hours later, table's full of plastic and paper wrapping and packaging, empty bottles and leftovers, glass shards and broken platters on the floor
they celebrated alone as usually happens in our family, since we're immigrants and the locals all hate our guts and our compatriots are all worse than gypsies
such celebrations end with dad fucking out of the apartment looking for adventure at night and mom falling asleep at the balcony where she locks herself when he chases her
decide to actually do something for once and clean up their mess
fail miserably and instead of putting the things that weren't eaten or drunk away i put them down my gullet
down an untouched whiskey they didn't get to and about 8000 kcals worth of food by the time i'm done cleaning and mopping the floor
i feel like putting a knife into my eyesocket right now
thankfully i'm a monumental fatass so i'm still gonna be conscious for a few minutes more
what am i supposed to do now, i can't sleep any more

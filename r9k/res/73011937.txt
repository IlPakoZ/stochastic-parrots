At what point do you just give up? 
At 20 it was abnormal that I was still a virgin, but it made sense to hold onto hope. I'm 26 now and still a virgin who has never had a gf. I've put in so much effort for no return, I've probably been rejected by hundreds of girls in the last few years with nothing to show for it except completely nuked self confidence, and an intense self hatred which I didn't have when I was younger. 'The worst she can say is no' is bullshit, I am mentally ruined by how much effort I put into getting a gf to not only fail, but to get hurt over and over again with not a single good memory. Even loser girls can just exist and eventually they'll get a bf. I hate that this is my life, that I try 10x harder than an average person to get a gf, romance, and affection, and fail every time.

the only thing that ever matters is being tall and handsome all other things are cope. you cannot negotiate love, women only love tall height and handsome face.

Should have given up at this point desu. If you aren't having a girl by this point then no amount of effort will get you a gf but you can only hope it happens to you by fate.

Looks determine your difficulty setting, so they're the most important thing, but not the only thing that matters. 
That's fair desu, I became obsessed with getting a gf though, and even with all my efforts and focus I failed. I think there is something fundamentally wrong with me that makes me unlovable.

move to southeast asia or south america, or even africa. you'll experience a renewed joy in life. fuck the haters

How did you approach those hundreds of girls?
<comment>
you got rejected by hundreds of girls? in what way? did you walk up to them, say they are pretty and ask for her number to meet sometime and got shut down or did you at least land a number or a date?
With hundreds of tries there must be more to it. please explain furtherHG

The problem is that you aren't neurotypical. As a 23yo virgin who also never had a gf I know your feel very well. Friends tell me that I'm not ugly and don't really get why I have no gf, but a non-neurotypical personality is completely repulsive to women if you don't have dark-triad traits to make up for them. If you're nice but "weird", you need to have Chad looks or a dark triad personality to make up fot it.
<comment>
Mostly by girls I met online. 
Yup, I'm basically accepted that I'm 'weird' at best at this point. As you say, the only weirdos who gets girls are either good looking or very dark triad. I have some dark triad traits, but am way too empathetic, anxious, and unstable to get or want the type of girl who would want a heavily dark triad guy.

For me, 30 is the point of no return. Also autism. There is no overcoming that shit; almost guaranteed NEETdom and inceldom.
Take the Black Pill, give up and move on to just worrying about your own survival. It's the only way. Unless you want to go ER.
Also bear in mind that the economy is shit and has no (good) place for young/inexperienced people. No wonder two generations stayed in the basement.

then try it in person another couple hundred times you faggot

That's the problem. Step outside,be yourself and eventually a girlfriend will find you.
<comment>
excluding HS when I was chad all the girls I fucked or dated have been met online, that is how many people choose to connect these days which is tragic
Also let me take a wild guess and and say your efforts have not included going to the gym and lifting weights
<comment>
Not everyone can be a winner. Not everyone is cut out for this world. Just do the bare minimum to continue existing (food, shelter etc) with least amount effort. Redirect your efforts into escapism: anime, movies, books, music, and most of all- fantasies in your head. Spend as much time as possible constructing worlds, scenarios, arguments in your mind. There you can really be anyone and do anything.

45%-55% of men in your cohort were virgins at age 20.
You are mentally unwell.
Seek therapy

You're not trying hard enough. I was a virgin at 25 until I moved to cambodia last year in June. My body count is 12 consisting of khmer and Thai girls, and 1 jap girl. And I already have a baby on the way in less than a year with pic related (admittedly wanted to have fun for 5 more years and enjoy the SEAmax life more before having a baby but shit happens. I chose the right woman that I love in the end to have a baby with. So it's whatever)
TLDR: In the incel world you either take the SEAmax pill, or you will die in the gutter alone. 
This is a loser mentality.

not OP but if you are a gym bro, how do you go about picking up going to the gym? i do pushups on the daily, sometimes situps, squats and pullups, whatever i can do at home and in the office but i never got weight and i always wondered, if you dont have a gymbro friend, how do you start hitting the gym? do you just look at youtube tutorials for techniques and form on how to lift shit? who explains etiquette and equipment to you?I would feel so lost but recently I have the mindset to improve my life

Charisma can heavily make up for lacking those two. 
Im tall but ugly af, but I know how to talk to people just not girls. I learned to be charismatic around guys and shut up around girls. Makes me look stoic and mysterious and has allowed me to get laid a few times despite my tism
<comment>
there are chinese woman, mongolian woman, kazakh woman, thai woman, filipino woman, vietnamese woman, indonesian woman and cambodian woman who have been married to men in my country in our neighborhood
among them, cambodian woman is the quietest and most introverted
<comment>
Meh. Depends. My gf is shy and introverted in public but very vocal to me. Sometimes she won't even translate in public for me and I'm like what the hell are you doing you want me to speak to this guy in English when he doesn't speak my language but you can't even speak Khmer to him? Her response is always "I'm shy you're stronger than me". But I definitely know other khmer girls that are very talkative and more assertive as well. The thing I do appreciate about Cambodians though is their hospitality is probably the best in southeast asia. They usually smile when they speak to you as a stranger. (It's honestly a rarity in the rest of Asia besides Japan desu). Thais, vietnamese, and Chinese are just flat out rude a lot of the time. And Koreans are just flat out cold. 
Side note: also unlike other Asians, despite that Cambodians are lower class, they don't slurp and smack their food. Major plus for me cause it drives me insane every time I visit Vietnam.

And Koreans are just flat out cold
i'm from south korea
i know what you're trying to say
just we don't like sugarcoated words that make other people feel better
we're quite straightforward
in my opinion, chinese and mongolian women are mean they are hot-headed
thai and filipino women seem to know how to seduce men i mean i feel like they're flirty meanwhile vietnamese and cambodian women seem to be more realistic
if i had the chance to date other asian girl
i wouldn't date a thai or a filipino girl
and it's not because they're not cute or attractive it's just that i think they're the kind of girls who are not very trustworthy as lovers

You could ask the staff at the gym to show you how to use the weights
<comment>

owo whats this

your mentality has little or no impact on whether you become a loser or a winner. rather, it's the result of your experiences, it's your personal wisdom.

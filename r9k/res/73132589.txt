Why type of girl do you usually attract robots?
<comment>
the non existent type
<comment>
goths, but not only women
<comment>
Probably cougars or just older women
<comment>
This kinda girl. the kind that's always on call, if y'know what I mean.
<comment>
Girls that pretend to be shy but aren't. I'm the shy one, you whores. You are supposed to approach me.
<comment>
Almost none, very occasionally women who experienced very traumatic events during their childhood. I think because I'm tall and calm, women like that feel safe with me.
<comment>
Thinking women find me attractive
Fucking kek.

Age gap. Either twice my age or teenagers. I've literally never been on a date with a girl who was within five years of my age.

There's this girl at my job that looks like a slightly less attractive version of the girl on the left
 I needed her to get me something last week, she sent me like 50 files of pure nonsense and I had to email her again today to ask for the files I needed, cc'd her manager on the email so I get what I need noe

Low self esteem, traumatized suburban UO types
<comment>
Mentally ill girls. Happened a few times. 
I hate myself
<comment>
None
Never
<comment>
Drug addicts, bpd/npd abusers, whores, and general basket cases. Oh and single moms :/
<comment>
Overweight mixed women.
<comment>
autistic ones
only mildly and theyre still attractive
<comment>
Absolutely ZERO.
And if i did, i would tell myself i am a faggot for disrespecting her by thinking she might be interested in me
<comment>
Apparently all women that I encounter are attracted to me on some level based on body language 
The only kind that actively make any kind of effort though are fat chicks, or old chicks
<comment>
Forgot to add, fat whales as well
<comment>
All of the girls who've openly liked me hit the perfect point on the autism spectrum where they're too high to be too oblivious to not realize I don't feel the same but just low enough for me(passing sperg) to look like a creep taking advantage of them.
<comment>
Ones with absent or poor father figures. I just want an autistic one again. Normalfag women are extremely insufferable.
<comment>
Cute slightly overweight women who I ultimately reject due to their mental health issues
<comment>
Most girls at least develop platonic feelings for me. I will say that I tend to attract ones with mental illness though. I try to help them as best I can.
<comment>
Ugly chicks and overweight (not obese) chicks.
I must look decent but still attainable for them or something.
Turned all of them down for years and have only fucked hot asian prostitutes because i am a schizoid sigma male (autistic sociopath)
<comment>
Pretty but abusive cluster b chicks

only 2 gfs i had asked me out. first was a wristcutter with daddy issues and second was "pansexual" gamer tumblrina. 3rd other female to ever show interest in me was a coworker who is a ESL single mother and would occasionally touch my butt when she walked past. she stopped working there soon after.
<comment>
Huh, me too. Are you also white?
<comment>
Yeah I am. original
<comment>
Why type of girl do you usually attract robots?
Mid 30s+ women
<comment>
You're not the only one. I wake up in a desert every day. In fact attract no one, not even platonically. The only people that actively want to get involved with me are gay men and I fucking despise every one of them.
<comment>
Dress nicely with good personality.
Have acceptable taste.
Isn't a normie.
Unique and interesting.
Why is it so hard to find someone like this?

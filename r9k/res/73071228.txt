just tell them your height lol. women are so bad at managing this part because their excuses are all so transparent and their dishonesty is enraging. no wonder so many men hate women

Do it so she can dox you and then laugh at you with her actual group of friends.
That final humiliation will finally let you know it's well and truly over.

What should I just say sorry im not attracted to you instead of trying to let guys down gently?
<comment>
yes, it's assumed anyways, and I do that to girls who I'm not attracted to.

if she really likes you it doesn't matter. i'm in love with a guy who objectively is not very attractive and a manlet but he's literally the most beautiful guy to me. don't give up

trying to let guys down gently
This dishonesty is the main thing that enrages me and makes men hate women. You're not "trying to .let guys down gently" you're trying to minimize the interpersonal and social fallout of your decision by reframing it. Lying and deceiving is the least "gentle" thing you could do short of being violent. Its even worse than insulting because it manipulates and tricks.
You should own your decision, the motivations for it (height/handsomeness) and accept the social consequences of an honest conveyance of them. That means losing friends, acquaintances, etc. If you can't do that you're a person without character. Weak. Limp.

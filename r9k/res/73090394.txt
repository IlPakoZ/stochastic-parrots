Once you reach 30 do you have to date people your age or older or can you still experiment with teens and young adults?

not only CAN you. you SHOULD be reaming out young women as you age. 
never listen to what seething roasties and simps say you should do. pump and dump as many young sluts as you can.

I don't think young women are seeking older men for those experiences though

I met my wife when she was 17 and I was 28. I'm 35 now but if I were suddenly single again I'd date the same age range. 
This is mostly because I only date virgins (in part due to jealousy/insecurity, in part because of low divorce statistics of marrying a virgin, in part because I find it disgusting to fuck a vagina that has had other men's cum inside it before). 
You also get to experience her "best" years, physically speaking. And there's an argument to be made that you can somewhat "shape" her into the wife you want during her formative years. 
If you're kind and caring to a young girl, then yeah do it. The only argument against people dating so young is that they're naive and easily manipulated. While not only is that immoral, but they don't stay young forever, they'll eventually that that kind of behavior was wrong and then leave you so it's a bad long-term strategy.
tl;dr: Go for it. Younger girls > Older girls

Are you retarded?
Older men have dated younger girls since forever.
The main reason so many more young guys are single compared to young girls is the young girls are in relationships with old bfs.

If she is more than 2 years younger than you it is borderline abusive.

When you hit 30 is when girls in their early 20s start actually giving you a chance. 
College girls don't want a college guy (unless he's a chad). College girls want a guy who already has his shit together, who has a career. A girl she can call "daddy". They can't see you as a man if you still need to turn in your english homework before midnight. Similarly, you're not much of a man if you're an intern. 
You guys don't understand female attraction at all. It's sad.

I'm 28 and I was thinking about the same thing Girls my age think I'm too young Because they look like grandma and I still look 19 early 20s they ask for ID and are very predatorial towards me I've been molested by a few women growing up so I don't necessarily like older aggressive women but at the same time I don't want to be the thing I hate

This is true. 
I can give anecdotal evidence too. For reference I'm >>73090468
My wife is doing her final year in Uni, and this week is her last week actually. She did her bachelor's and then she did the teacher education program (2 years). 
The school held a Gala last week, so I got to meet a bunch of her classmates. 
These were early childhood education majors so it was all girls her age (about 24), and their dates were all boyfriends/husbands that were about my age (late twenties to mid 30s). All of them had somewhat respectable jobs and from what I could tell none of them were currently in school.
This is the way of the world, don't let leftwing echochambers like reddit convince you otherwise. A sizeable age gap is completely normal.

It's mostly zoomer women dating millennial men.
<comment>
No man should date a woman past the age of 25. Women don't date under 6'0, men shouldn't date over 25y old.

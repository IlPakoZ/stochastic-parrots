I am literally too autistic for a hot girlfriend
I am a decent looking guy and can pull some okay girls but theres literally a limit if you are autistic. Stacies who were popular in high school will never go for you I bet even if youre a model if youre completely autistic they will run off hell most of my gfs have run off cause of my autism. Anyway my point is yeah looks are important but if youre autistic its pretty much game over for getting with pretty girls when youre competing with chads who are not only handsome but smooth
YOURE AN OASIS FAN? ILL BE YOUR GF
sounds like liam gallagher.
I would love an oasis gf
what about me? can i get an rem gf?
they do this? i thought they went direct to dvd. who wants to watch a concert movie in an overpriced theater? do they do this with documentaries too?
YES!!!! right here
rem... im sure you'll find one out there
yeah... in the great beyond. haha get it? get it??? tell me you get it... plz
im looking for answers from the great beyond &lt;3
NO WAYYYY
(marry me)
but you're rem over oasis or?
oh definitely. rem was creative and experimented with different sounds each album. not was was oasis repetitive, but they blantanly ripped of rem (morning glory sounds a lot like the one I love). in fact a lot of their sound can be traced to rem's document album. oh and despite michael stipe being openly flamboyant he was still less annoying than the gallaghers.
even fucking blur were more creative than oasis
what's your discord or do you want me to give mine
blur is better
i dont know if i have the tism or not, but i can kinda confirm this, they get interested in me but if they talk to me for long enough they get kinda repulsed
i made the oasis pepe how about you be my gf instead
xx
what a dogshit take

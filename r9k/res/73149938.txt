Men bear the brunt of natural selection, I'd argue the vast majority of our ancestors pre agriculture were female.

I feel that, people infantilize me a lot too
But girls were never interested in me

men are very rarely interested in me either, but i dont mind that.. i dont really have the understanding of how to conform to trends or be appealing to men. i suspect most autists are the same, no matter the gender

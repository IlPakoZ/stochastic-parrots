Girls should not dress like this to school.
I have seen this a lot in real life and videos/tiktoks/instagram stories. Don't they see that their hard nipples are showing? I don't get it. It's like tey are blind.
They know it's showing, they like it. They also want to be casual about it to look extra cool. Really cringe.
i think women should be allowed to wear whatever they want without being judged
Why not? It's hot
I have, it's so fucking bad. 
She can do whatever she wants, but holy shit is it cringe. 
Tight dresses, no bra, short tops, they basically keep no secrets. It's very off-putting as to their character. 
In reality idaf, I'd just never talk to them anyway.
so youre going to stay single for life then?
shes in an elevator, not a school
I mean i don't care because i fap to them but it isn't something subtle. They must be doing it on purpose.
 have phone
 have mirror
Why are women too dumb to realize you can just point the camera at yourself and see the screen in the mirror?
no floor 4, no 13, no 24, no 34 but 40-49 is fine? Hypocrites.
Women do this because it looks better, not due to practical reasons. Allows to capture a bigger picture
What the fuck is that stupid face? Lilo looking bitch
not like I want to, but it's looking like that. 
Not every girl dresses like this, just some at my uni. And I find it kinda weird. They can do whatever they want tho.
i think women should be allowed to wear whatever they want 
Sure
without being judged
Unfortunately, you don't have mind control super powers so people will continue to judge someone's character by observing their actions since it's the only way to do so.
the elevator is the school I graduated there
because they are homosexuals
everyone looks better with a mirror selfie.

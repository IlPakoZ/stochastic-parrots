I sense a great evil within me. I feel like I'm two faced. Genuinely kind, but also have this malice inside of me. Idk how to describe it. 
It's sort of like when you have intrusive thoughts, only that I feel I'm at the cusp of acting on them i.e. "they are so weak. Just imagine if I kicked their asses. They wouldn't be able to do anything about it" or "look at this animal. They cherish me. Just imagine if I stepped on their tail" etc. 
Idk why I'm like this. It's also why I never drink or do drugs. Because I feel if I did, my self-control would go away and I'd act on these thoughts. I tend to feel them when I sense vulnerabilities i.e. when someone puts their trust on me 
Am I supposed to stay away from relationships?

That's called being a teenager, timmy.

can relate, i always want to be kind but honestly i have the most horrible yet gratifying fantasies about kicking someone i cant stand to the kerb and just ramming their head against the floor. im very meek and passive aswell, perhaps its my lack of power that leads me to being 'kind' to everyone.

The kind thoughts derive from your nurture. Due to your life in the modern world where success is achieved through the collective and not though violent competition, you as well as most people learned to be kind. The violent/ill-willed thoughts derive from your nature. Of course just because those thoughts are natural, that doesn't mean they're good. You either have to control them until the end of your life or give in to temptation, but that probably wouldn't be good for you.

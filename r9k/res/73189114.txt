Thank you, God. You know what's best.
Thanks big man, I hope you bust a fat one to our suffering
i'm glad god made me a masochist so that his endless punishment and denial was something i could learn to enjoy.
he has a plan for everyone! praise be! glory to his name!
im glad god gave us the ability to see past and consciously reject our primitive carnal desires which only lead to deeper suffering
do whatever you will, you created me as i am
forgive me if you dont like me, i am sad you dont like your creation, allow me to forget
Its his way of punishing you for choosing to be a monk in your past life.
No STDs ever!

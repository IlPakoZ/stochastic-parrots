Katana Zero is good for feels.
Ruiner is good for a brutal revenge quest kinda feel.
Check out "Star Fetchers" it's really short though but it's got those feels I cant describe.
Any of the Yakuza games. Any of the Nier games. Anything Suda 51

In this order: Silver Case, Flower Sun and Rain, Silver Case: The 25th Ward, Killer7. This is the order for the early KTP games in the series. But these are either hit or miss people either love or hate them.
I love Suda51 &lt;3

shit, i forgot to also recommend SOMA.

Omori.
Maybe try playing some coop game with an interesting person who reciprocates

which part of it?

Good job drunk anon!
congratulating me makes it sound like i was otherwise an alcoholic- which, i was a little bit before because i didnt feel like stopping drinking before me intial week break
Pic rel is only alcohol i really like, but still rarely drink
have you tried harder alcohol? why dont you drink proper liquor? things like those drinks will give you really bad hangovers, you should try whisky. 
the legal standard for drinking is 1 drink per hour. and one shot is one drink, and so is like 1 beer. theyre all considered 1 drink. if you drink 2-3 drinks an hour over the span of 6 hours youll probably enjoy yourself. alcohol makes you dehydrated, so its best to have an entire glass of water per 1-2 drinks. also stop drinking about 2 hours before bed. or about 1h 45 minutes at best. if you do all of this, youll almost certainly avoid getting hungover and will be able to drink multiple nights in a row
I think i'll always submit in the end.
yeah :/
True!
but you should be okay with action
makes me feel physically sick
youve had this your whole life though right? isnt it true that after you get over the hump you feel better? i think youre in a position where youre paralyzed from not wanting to do anything because you dont realize that everything falls back into equilibrium, so youre demotivated to do anything because you assume if you do youll be stuck and never feel right/ comfy again- but its maybe worth noting that once you climb the mountain your life does feel normal again after
damage and pain.
simply wouldn't get myself into that position >~&lt;
hm, but if you got into that position would you be able to get out of it?
<comment>
Though the act of being forced to do things and having things done to you is inherently hot to me
Thoughts?
thats a really dense subject desu that could go so many ways. i think its legitimate in the context of somebody you have a lot of legitimate trust in. theirs nothing really wrong with that at that point in time. but i think a lot of bottoms tend to have an extraordinarily low bar when it comes to this, a minor amount of day-to-day trust goes a long way in sexual trust/ if that person is attractive for a bottom
w-woah buddy. Why not earlier threads? 
cause i wasnt in them. im not in every thread, sometimes i go leaps in time not being here. this recent stint just starts at the 70s 
i'm kinda like that to a much lesser degree. I don't like deleting stuff and so on
you cant make decsions but i can; and i cant delete shit, but you can. this is why the intp/infp types compliment each other well
I actually did start learning on my own. It's going good so far though i only just started lol
to be continued
I have a problem with controlling my impulse to eat desu. I will drink more water
you can ghrelin inhibitors or whatever 
not my money and they don't care ._.
sad
a waste of time to cook unless i have to
nono, its a useful skill and its better than goyslopping your way through life especially because its technically cheaper
It was working good and then it stopped
why not further simulate that environment though? you know that being in those situations makes you do shit, so why not just put yourself into those environments?

i really want to die like 95% of the time
<comment>
I know dammit i know ;-;
its actually not that big of a deal if you can get used to fasting/ going lengths of time without eating
See i think that would only ruin the mystery and wouldn't exactly be satisfying no matter what the answers are >~&lt;
hmmm, hard disagree desu; i love esotericism and mysticism and shit i want all the details 
Yeah but people are emotional and it's a crazy situation. They care about eachother so they don't think rationally. 
yeah, ultimately the best decisions which could've been done would've meant we had no movie
Like, yeah she will die but she can't just watch you know? It's that helplessness that makes it so scary for me ;-;
i was fantasizing about how based it would be if the dad took his son out front and slit his throat; just as a final act of regaining control, making their entire night worthless having lost multiple members, his whole family was fucked anyway lol idk- something REAL
Most of them desu. I didn't like freaks,witches and so on. 
hmm, why? i liked those
One with the hotel was ok
interesting, i didnt like that as much. that when it fell off really
wha u mean?
well i said i was probably deficient in something like vitamins or minerals and you agreed you might be too. so i was joking that youre deficient, but in dick. as in you dont get any dick
I hope so
update! on the cognitive decline, now that youve gone outside
First one is literally me and funny
bsed
Second one is funny and awkward. I'm the type that doesn't tell the waiter he got my order wrong :3
knew it lol
Third one idk what to think about. I like sunny weather but not too hot idk what he means
i agree with that one the most i like shitty weather the most, i think its something you get or dont
<comment>
Everyone looks down on you. Always condescends. I don't understand social stuff, I don't understand the world.
<comment>
i really wish that i had a funny bf who would sneak into the back of my large hoodie. then i would never get cold, he would put his arms in the armholes next to mine because its funny
<comment>
true crime stuff and some cooking videos
<comment>
This right here is the hottest thing i have seen!!
<comment>
thanks im a lewd writer on the side
<comment>
Oh really?
Hmmm
I pressume you are one erp guy?
Or maybe written comics of that kind of thing
Maybe furry ones??
<comment>
sorry i shouldve said that i wasnt entirely serious. comics are weird
<comment>
Oh, then how's youre a lewd writter?
Tbh i like comics more than porn
<comment>
What you call fun i call psychological torture. 
being out on the wild an everything that comes with it can be exciting, i think you need to work on finding comfort outside of traditional means. their isnt a fluffy comfy bed but you are growing as a person and you are gaining new skills etc you should find comfort in the simpleness of it. that you dont need an entire sprawling city to be comfy. theirs comfort in that
I was that one kid that was looking forward to school starting again.
oof. no comment. although at least you weren't the kid that dreaded school starting because of bullying
My classmates all had fun and went to sea and i was all by myself in a shitty place with house full of grasshoppers and bugs and they scare me and i couldn't sleep well and food was bad and i didn't have anything fun to do
this is really cute, you talk just like mybf its incredible. i really dont know what to say though, i dont know how you two are like this lol i really think you should just work on taking pleasure in simplicity and whatnot 
(i don't even like the sea but ok)
classic infp thalassophobia moment
Everything is fun with bf, kinda. 
true!
I need access to gym/parks, bike tracks
you bike?
<comment>
im not really a lewd writer hahaha!!!!!!
<comment>
I do like being away from people. Explain the appeal to me?
less is more? cities are inherently complicated and the work that it takes to conquer it is useless, it necessities human action. it also houses horrible people. rural areas and the woods are comfy in how disconnected they are from the modern world of stress and emotion and all of the exhaustion of everyday life. its just two different lifestyles, city lifestyle exhausts you mentally and emotionally, woods lifestyle exhausts you physically but you remain intact as a person. its interesting in that way that woods people are seen as lacking emotion while city niggers are seen as emotional- even though in practice its woods people who are easily emotionally exhausted and city people who tend toward sociopathic behaviors
Dad forced me too used to spend 
sad. but youll maybe appreciate it eventually 
summers at my mom's place which is isolated small town but very nice in the summer and i loved it as it's still a town and had things to do
thats nice! you still go?
Tell me about it
^
I try not to but i do try to be polite as well
i just dont talk to anyone ever desu...
But you still have friends and shit now?
irl? i have none. i have some people i really love and relate to but if they knew i was gay would disown me so its hard to say the relationships are legitimate
I basically don't have any and i'm fine with it. I prefer online interactions.
same
Gym is stressful despite everyone minding their own business
yeah :/
I'm doing fine on my own. I can ask for pointers if i get stuck. No need to worry &lt;3
okay&lt;3

this will be a different post later

I'm mentally unstable and bad at communicating my feelings as i don't really understand them myself

He dodged a bullet with me but i still miss him :(
<comment>
tfw I actually like cleaning and cooking but am just bad about doing it in the room that I'm in right now. 
tfw no bf who has a wfh job and I can be a househusband who makes good meals and keeps things smelling nice and clean.
<comment>
I used to be cute but aged very quickly (probably due to meds), by the time I move out of my parents' house and am able to finally start dating, I'll probably be too ugly. But I'll try it anyways I guess.
<comment>
What you mean nony?
<comment>
Maybe you are still very cute but don't like the way you aged
Try dating now, just don't let them go to your house
<comment>
I'll be good ugly 
Anon, I'm going to say this as tactfully as possible. Unless you have rotten teeth (or have holes in them) missing limbs, are disfigured somehow, you will likely be fine.
<comment>
hues right the apps are the way. ldr is an unnecessary barrier to entry to a relationship that makes it too easy to avoid
<comment>
TFW no chuby dom side bf
<comment>
Try dating now, just don't let them go to your house
I might try, though my parents are ultra control freaks and homophobes lmao.
I hope so! I'm ugly but I have a big heart :(
<comment>
I want my bf to sniff me and kiss me
<comment>
Hi, I'm chubby, don't like anal, but am very dominant (not cruel unless you want me to be). I also cook, clean, and am good at doing laundry and stuff (even complicated things). No, I still can't fold a fitted sheet though. 
Caveat: if you're someone who doesn't like strong smelling room sprays or is allergic to cats you may not like me.
<comment>
tfw no chubby subby bf who's big and smooth and soff like a pillow
<comment>
It's so hard to socialize when work drains all of my energy because I'm retarded
I just want an understanding bf who's okay with me being kind of useless when I get home as long as I put food on the table
<comment>
animeposter is fat
Many such cases. This must mean the Chudjak poster is handsome
<comment>
some times I really wanna hold someone's hand
<comment>
Some times i want to kidnap cute straight guys but i wouldn't actually do that haha
<comment>
I'm actually losing weight.
<comment>
how chubby we talking?
im a 'side' basically, i like mutual jo and dominating roleplay. I've been with a lot of guys who just liked to hold me down, make me smell them, etc.
<comment>
SEXHAVERS IN THIS FREAKING THREAD
<comment>
I should stop voluntarily giving out so many warning signs, it does me no good obviously. Well if i could predict how things would end up i'd do it differently. More i think about things like this more i regret how i handled certain interractions. In fact, looking back, i could've had a pretty awesome deal if i wasn't too scared and honest/considerate. He would be ok with it too ;_;
<comment>
Damn I thought sides were super rare, I'm surprised you were able to find guys
<comment>
how chubby are we taking
I have a bit of a belly but nothing too drastic. 
hold me down, make me smell them
Well, do you like that?
<comment>
they weren't necessary sides, mostly top guys who'd settle for fooling around and getting sucked off a bit. most would fuck me if they could.
Well, do you like that?
its like a need for me. i just like thicker guys who make me feel owned.
<comment>
I just hand red flags out like freaking candy. They can deal with or not because it's the worst im going to get. Idk anon what if you get into a long relationship and they only later realise how much of a sperg you are
<comment>
Sides are cool
<comment>
What Red flags you give?
<comment>
they weren't necessary sides, mostly top guys who'd settle for fooling around and getting sucked off a bit. most would fuck me if they could
Aaah so it's fine for hookups but probably harder to find long term
I agree
<comment>
harder to find long term
yeah, especially since sides basically have their own top / bottom dynamics in addition to guys who just see it as an equalist thing.
most sides are just bottoms who stopped bottoming so want to suck dick. i hate having my dick sucked. I like a dick in my face but not really into bobbing my head for a guy.
<comment>
i hate having my dick sucked.
why? i would try to suck the bottoms dick a lot
<comment>
since sides basically have their own top / bottom dynamics in addition to guys who just see it as an equalist thing.
oh my god lol
<comment>
You shouldn't probably. I do it too :(
Idk anon what if you get into a long relationship and they only later realise how much of a sperg you are
This is why i do it. If anyone wants to be with me or even friends they should know , that's the logic. If they like me for who i am (very rare) that i know they like me despite knowing how i am
But jokes on you  as i was in a long relationship where he knew how much of a sperg i am and it didn't work out 
It's hard to put into words
get too close to someone quickly, give up too many intimate details
probably desperation
"here is a list of all the things wrong with me, is this how you attract someone :D"
I also don't give up too much positive feedback cause i'm so insecure and scares od being rejected (or of misinterpreting a signal) that anything than literally saying " hey i have strong feelings for you, wanna be bfs?" wouldn't be enough to convince me the other person is interested in me. It probably makes people lose interest and think i'm not interested in them
<comment>
Just want to hide away
Didn't even go outside today
I want to die today
When I woke up I cried today
Stargazing wide awake
If I had wings I'd fly away
Wish I could pause the game
Delete the save and just start again
I often lie awake
Thinking of my great escape
No time for heartbreak
From those feelings I shy away
Treated just like a toy
Always playing with my heart
I'm so emotional
Emotionally scarred
Feel like a background character
Playing my part
I need some surgery
Surgery on my heart
My only friend is my computer
I feel like such a loser
I'm so ugly I'm so stupid
Never learned I need a tutor

You type like an english translation of Crime and Punishment. You say so that if you hid your nature it would have worked out better but give good reasons to why one should hand out red flags. Seems like a lose lose situation either way
<comment>
Okay I'm gonna go to bed, imagine having a bf who loves me, and sleep.

Good Rest anon

Lmao that's a n-new one
You say so that if you hid your nature it would have worked out better but give good reasons to why one should hand out red flags.
Yeah that's what i did :/
Seems like a lose lose situation either way
That's only because it is. But i think being more reserved is worth a shot. You probably shouldn't unload all your issues on someone you don't know well enough. t-then again ehat if they stop talking to you after you do so arghhhhhhhhh
<comment>
You probably shouldn't unload all your issues on someone you don't know well enough.
Yea i also learned that the hard way. Women hate emotional men so it may be the same for men if i act like i have no weakness
<comment>
Women hate emotional men
Yeah
it may be the same for men if i act like i have no weakness
Don't know. I'm just saying to be more cautions. I looked up what i said and it's worse than i thought
you are very kind
i catch feelings for guys who are kind to me
Holy shit kill me now. I didn't know i said that right after D:
i was feeling bad and i needed this
Now this just makes someone feel responsabilty for you i think. It's probably not good to say right?
btw i'm still thinking about another guy
I really know what to say to people :D

Why don't guys that try to look like anime characters exist and why do they all have onlyfans

Holy fuck anon that last sentence gave me a fucking cringe heart attack. What on earth did you think saying that would achieve
<comment>
why don't perfect people exist
This is why I took em cowboy pills. Now I don't mind if a guy has scars or a funny nose
<comment>
not perfect people, just boys who go for the "cute anime boy """"aesthetic"""" over being bearded, anonymous grindr man #45
<comment>
tfw no bf that has Hex Maniac eyes
<comment>
yee yee

<comment>
be kind
Yessir I say good night to all the sleepy fellas here.
Ah fair enough. But I think those anime types are generally more inclined to be popular gay chads with the personality go with it
<comment>
I have no idea. I would like to ask myself that. Go back in time and slap me. Probably because i'm retarded and don't think as much as i should. It's even worse than that but i already embarrassed myself enough
<comment>
Why reimu I outta kick your fucking ass. Don't worry anon soon you will embrace the cringe
<comment>
You mean why do only guys who look like that also have onlyfans? Is this really such a mystery?
But yes i prefer that look as well. Very cute n cool
<comment>
i want a hello kitty plushie now

I will slay you bpdemon

I might start crying. It fucking sucks, as maybe this could've been a cool deal and i messed it up. Well whatever, too late to change the past now
<comment>
tfw no fbf that wants to khs whenever he embarrasses himself
<comment>
Classless amateurs. I studied the flower of battle. 
Let it out anon. You'll feel better afterwards.
<comment>
I should sleep :(
Do you think contacting the same guy would be stupid? He didn't respond after i said cringy things like that. It will come of as desperate for sure, what should i do?
<comment>
of as desperate for sure
Yes it will :( Try your luck elsewhere. Good night anon

i won't dw it's fine! i want you to feel happy and even though i know you don't really like me, i hope to make you feel a little bit better in this pretty rough state. hughug, ily anon
<comment>
Astounding. I concede anon, you're right.

Wait a min. Is this aardappel (while I was eating chips today I saw on the packaging that that's the word for potato) anon?
<comment>
aardappel anon
yesh, it's me, sorry :( aard-appel directly translates to earth apple in case you were wondering
<comment>
No, I'm a silly little robot with silly little ideas.
<comment>
I was about to ask you if "aard" meant "earth" :D The greatest thing that knowing (a bit of) german enables me is to watch cute spergy german-speaking tech youtubers!
How are you doing? Built any cool sets lately? Why don't ya bf venti-anon? And lastly, what's your favorite minecraft mod?
<comment>
tfw you took a 'small nap' after dinner and end up sleeping until 3am. 
damn I almost had a normal sleep schedule again.
<comment>
Yeah, I got about a week or so to fix mine.
<comment>
why do the Dutch call them 'earth apples' when the Germans have their separate own word for them?
<comment>
I hear in Bavaria and Austria they say "erdapfel" too.
<comment>
one would think that would be in the low German regions that border the Netherlands, not the High German regions. Weird how languages work.
<comment>
omg lol why are bavarians so stupid like that?

german tech youtubers, that's a whole genre i've never delved in to but it sounds fun! 
im doing okay nony, thank you for asking. i do have a cold again though... 
lego stuff
well i've still been passively working on my little colony build, this is the current state of it.
favorite minecraft mod
hmmm... that's a hard pick desu! i think the Aether, a classic but i've had so much fun with that one! i always loved the heavenly aesthetic. what is yours non? :3
venti
venti is pretty nice, but i can't bring someone down with all my mental struggles. i think being in a relationship right now is a pretty horrible idea :(
and well also, we live super far away from each other so it's pretty unrealistic. also, venti has a bf so there's literally no chance
<comment>
oh bleh, forgot my picture :(
<comment>
Anon its 3:43 am on sunday!!!!
thats morning!!!!
and I woke up at this hour so yes it is good morning.
<comment>
storyanon barely relevant accident time. 
In hs we had an exchange student from Bavaria (and one from a town near Hamburg, too), he was cute even though I barely said more than two words to him.
The other one from Hamburg was a weirdo, claimed to be a right-winger and that his father was some NPD party member. Wore his grandfather's Gestapo jacket to school until he got in trouble for it and had to stop. Said his other grandfather was in the SS and was killed during the war. 
I think like me he could have been making stuff up though, as he changed his story a couple times. First saying his Grandfather was killed at Stalingrad, then later on to Kursk.

Dude thats the ideal bf what are you talking about? 
me personally ive never met a European sadly. Tourism does not seem very big in my rural bumpkin town.
<comment>
counterpoint: hot feminine toned man in love with hot big strong edgy buff man = cute and good
<comment>
except that he was homophobic and hated gay people? Called the few openly gay guys faggots to their faces? Only after he was threatened with being sent back did he stop.
<comment>
cute and good
Yes me double agree agree. Although the edgy man must have a touch of gentleness just like guts
<comment>
except that he was homophobic and hated gay people? Called the few openly gay guys faggots to their faces? Only after he was threatened with being sent back did he stop.
I CAN FIX HIM!!!! I CAN FIX HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Did those gay cunts give him a beating? I thought it was common for yanks to fight
lol
<comment>
Maybe you should eat more oranges anon, that could increase your cold resistance. Hope you start feeling better nonny. Take some rest and enjoy soup. Once I get sick I get a giant spike in suicidal thoughts, so be sure to take care, ok?
Aether
The aerbunny is the most epic mob to ever appear in the entire minecraft extended universe. imo.
what is yours non?
Hmm I don't really know. I liked Thermal Expansion and it's associates, and I find inventory pets adorable.
venti has a bf
I think they sadly broke up.
<comment>
I thought it was common for yanks to fight
I'm the other guy you replied but it depends. The only people ive seen get in a fist fight were Hispanic and Black. Asians and Whites seem to keep out of those kinds of things. 
Which me personally? I agree with. Ive see way too many videos of street fights where the guy gets picked up and fucking slammed to the ground and starts spazing the fuck out. I'm not getting fucking paralyzed over anything especially not over being called a slur.
<comment>
He was also just generally an asshole to people. The thing is, he was no tall, blonde haired, blue eyed ubermensch. Dude was rather short, not all that strong/buff, and was brown eyes/ black hair. Without his jacket no one would even know he wasn't just a run of the mill amerimutt.
<comment>
Ouch yes not worth it. 
s brown eyes/ black hair. 
Many such cases
<comment>
Oh no, they never fought back. Plus they were kinda used to it since this was the midwest in the mid 2000s, not get killed for being gay level but you were definitely going to catch a few slurs thrown your way.
<comment>
The thing is, he was no tall, blonde haired, blue eyed ubermensch. Dude was rather short, not all that strong/buff, and was brown eyes/ black hair
German chudjak :0
I still find this appealing. I find the German accent and language to be very attractive. Like I said before I could of fixed him.

ah, pretty cool pick! i wish i was good at redstone stuff, but it melts my brain :( inventory pets is amazing, great mod aa
venti bf
are we talking about the same bf? i remember about two weeks ago he said that he had found a perfect husband who liked legos and is a christian? did you mean him or the bf from before that? so many bfs...
<comment>
well I can't keep track of all the story anon lore. You don't operate under a tripcode or a avatar. You are just such a fuck up(no offence) that you are recognizable. Which I find to be much more respectable than avatarfags or tripcoders.
<comment>
i pity chemical warfare specialists. Stuck in that gimpsuit for fucking days every training deployment
<comment>
The thing is, he was no tall, blonde haired, blue eyed ubermensch.
people who pretend to know shit about germany but have the most superficial overview of third reich era germany
think for two seconds about what this actual literal character actually is "blue eyed blond haired tall" thats a genetic outlier everywhere you fucking imbecile
this retarded terminally western terminally American scholarship that larps as though ALL of germany had these triats! yup! germany! blue eyed blond haired! a nation of genetic exceptions! 
you have to believe 1 of 2 impossible things
1. you have to believe that germany became a nation full of genetic exceptions sometime between 1933-1945 
or
2. that everyone in germany was delusional enough to believe that something very few people were was the real german and that the german people hated probably over half its population 
to make the claim that everyone in germany believed in this really movie plot tier character as the supreme being you have to somehow justify the fact that this type of person was never common to german society. how would german society therefore worship as the most legitimate being, be a person that was not common? how would that actually happen? does something like that make rational sense?
the ubermensch was an ideal that consisted primarily of character traits which are more prevalent in certain phenotypical expressions. so blond, blue eyed, and tall were three individual traits that most often yielded men of greater character
mocking people for their appearance is obscene.

Sure it gets hot and must suck but the trade off is that it looks super fucking cool. You win some you lose some as they say.

I'm still an oldfag, and believe trips should only be used in one thread when you absolutely need to recognized. Plus I'm too lazy to make one.
<comment>
What? Anon he was trying to say that all Germans or most Germans look like that. All he is saying is that he was not very attractive nor the ideal le nazi bf!!!! No need to have an autistic meltdown.
<comment>
he was 
fuck.
he wasn't*
<comment>
he was having a plebbit moment where he made fun of the nazi larp german for not having blond hair, blue eyes, or for being tall. 
he was mocking him based on a lie produced by anti-german english and American historians who never bothered to understand anything about german society under hitler. 
the meltdown is warranted because its pretty fucking ridiculous to allow people to use retarded scholarship to justify mocking somebodies appearance and to put them down
even more so since its done from a glass house
<comment>
all nazi era propaganda depict the nordic phenotype as the master race and superior
a-akushlally it was all Germans, and ubermensch was about character.
Meanwhile the nazis literally used phenotypical classifications to determine who was gassed or considered subhuman. 
never thought we'd get nazi apologists here.

i wanna suck a big phat stinky nigger dick with my dumb sissy white bwoi lips!

<comment>
Even I could be considered a racist.

<comment>
Yes. i do try to treat all people with a basic level of kindness and respect. Although this does not stop me from being horribly racist online because the internet isn't real dude.
<comment>
I should have not doubted my fellow chuds

You know whats an underated accent? the midwestern/canadian accent
very cute
<comment>
gaybots find my native accent cute 
I've had to suppress it (and the heavy dialect it comes with) over the years because I was mocked for it, feels good that someone likes it.
<comment>
Same its all I think about now.
<comment>
Right now there is nothing i'd want to do more than beat the shit out of  me for all the mistakes i made and stupid things i said 
I would go all out, full power punches and kicks like i'm hitting a bag. Would try to avoid doing lasting damage (like teeth an d head). Maybe i would feel better after that
<comment>
I'm not autistic, just awkward and stupid
<comment>
This but i give him a sword. That weak little faggot would just jab at me and i would go into a upper bind then pin him on the ground and start making o- start punching him. Yep.

Every time that my computer outputs something that I find bad (text, images, sounds) I must clear it's BIOS memory before I can continue doing stuff which I care about ._.

<comment>

Never tried it, but do to finding shrooms tasty I'm betting on mushroom soup being delicious.
venti bf
Oh, in that case I have no idea actually. I guess my info was outdated.
And you know, you keep being nice to me. What's up with that?
<comment>
It's not, but it's surprising that even after almost a full year being here I haven't met even ONE full japanese gay person that isn't looking for sex online
<comment>
it's so over for you my chigga
<comment>
Isn't Japan super homophobic? It's technically legal but still taboo and everyone just thinks being gay is a perverted sex fetish? Like you can't come out and have a relationship without getting fired or kicked out of school
<comment>

Take your autism back to Wizchan.
<comment>
real
The number 1 gay dating app here is also a fucking STD breeding zone
Filled with half of the Grindr type and half of hosts trying to promote their bars
Finding a Japanese guy that just wants to go on a meaningful, wholesome date might be harder than finding a girl to fuck 
There are gay districts but I don't really want to go there since I'm bad with alcohol, and everyone's most likely sex hungry. very conservative country but most of the younger people don't care about it. just feels pointless, since back in america getting a date with a decent person seemed somewhat possible but here it's virtually impossible without a ONS
<comment>
i have no idea what that is
Yaoi was a psyops... What are you actually going to do anon? Are you only there for work or was it a full move

<comment>
genuinely hope youre able to identify and work on the mental issues that informed this post before they do irreversible damage
point stands.
<comment>
I would if they had the brain of an actual male transplanted to their body, and looked like an actual male
<comment>
Sometimes i see threads that are literally me and people in situations just like mine and it makes me sad that i'm not so special. I know i didn't make them but i feel strange reading them and don't know what to think
<comment>
No because they have the heart of a w*man. Poisonous and perfidious creatures only second to an angl*id
<comment>
I like cocks so that's a hard no from me buddy
<comment>
No, duh.
no male brain
no male face
no muscles
no pp
What would be the point of that?
<comment>
I'm touching my muscles right now
<comment>
no, i prefer less stereotypically masculine men and i wouldn't want to undermine his identity
<comment>
thinking about the punching bag my dad hung in the basement from a beam directly under my bedroom so that the floor would shake and rumble and knock things off the shelves for an hour whenever he was in a bad mood and felt like "working out"
<comment>
Did you get bothered by that anon? If yes, then you should have peeled your dad's skin off, in my humble opinion that is.
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
You know anon, in all honesty, if you were right next to me right now... I'd hug you.
Is there something you wanna talk about? I have all the time in the world, so I can listen or ramble as much as you want me to.

<comment>
I did your mom recently. Wait I guess that's an exception to the rule.
<comment>
You'd really love me, a mexican chudjak? :0
<comment>
But anon I'm specifically asking for an instance where the rule holds true.
<comment>
Wow a Mexican chud that's even cuter

I can't handle seeing gay couples when I'm walking outside, hits me in the feels and makes me uncomfortable

tfw no ~5'10", chubby twink, mathematician/physicist bf that's ready for summer uwu
<comment>
bros i just went to the rate thread on soc and im so much uglier than all of them :((((( i thought it would be ugly people like me
<comment>
There's a selection bias at play, silly. Attractive people are way more likely to post their pictures 
True uggos seldom do that
<comment>
Hello, mister bitterness? Go get mad at the breeders. Anytime I see a gay couple I get happy for them and I know that if they can do it, so can I
<comment>
I know that if they can do it, so can I
They're way more good looking than me though.
<comment>
that's incredibly sweet bunny tysmm! i'd love to hug you back, you really do deserve it, i mean it! well... actually yes! it was my father's birthday today, so we just went out to have some dinner! (thats also the reason for my late reply, bleh, im sorry for that... i'll have all the time in the world to send messages now though ^^) i had a really good pizza which was nice! a pizza margeritha to be exact. do you like pizzas too? 
would you like to talk about anything fren? is there something you'd like to get off your chest? i can imagine that maybe you feel quite horrible and im totally ready to hear it all if you wish. if not that's okay too, then i can probably ramble about lego things ^-^ look forward to your reply bunny, stay strong lil one !
<comment>
theres a selection bias
Precisely. Theyre 4channers in the first place so they should ALL be ugly. But no, legit chads and cuties posting there
<comment>
I'm occasionally tempted to post in one of those rate me threads but a) having my face on 4chan sounds like a bad idea and b) someone I know posts very embarrassing posts on /soc/ and I don't want to embarrass him by letting him know I know
<comment>
I'd like to see how others would rate me but i'm scared to post face. Not to mention sometimes they don't even rate others they just post their own. And i've seen posts be ignored if they post it late in the thread
Nigga 4chan is mostly cute ppl,you should know that by now :P
Adorable
<comment>
Settle down for your looks match
<comment>
gay
no interested in relationships or sex
I feel so left out in these threads cuz it's just BF BF BF BF MUH BF ME LONELY ME WANT COCKY
<comment>
How can you be gay but uninterested in sex or relationships? You're not gay at all then. You're just nothing. There are people who are just not into sex or just not into relationships who can be gay but if you're both, how do you even consider yourself gay?
<comment>
Sex is something you do, sexual attraction is something you feel.
<comment>
mom is sending me old pictures of me when i was a child
Makes me a bit sad and nostalgic
<comment>
you can find men attractive without being interested in sex
<comment>
Thank you babe, I'll take it from here.

Is there a romantic equivalent of a friends with benefits? Like a guy I can talk to, visit and cuddle/kiss every week or two.

All these racebait threads are so fucking pointless. Women like Chad and hate incels regardless of what race.

regardless of what race
You see, this is where some disagree
<comment>
The thing is white guys cant be incels. They can always go to some 3rd world country in SEA anf find a wife.

<comment>
No, women have been brainwashed into worshipping BBC
<comment>
They are autistic brainlets. Tall and handsome men will always be liked by most women, short and ugly men will always be disliked
<comment>
and so can Korean guys.
Korean guys are the biggest SEA havers.
So going by ur logic JBK is law.

Race may play some small role, but it's undeniable that other factors are more important. The problem is that race-baiters are obsessed with a "racial hierarchy" where some races (usually the race they are) are better than others (usually everyone else). Don't be fooled by them, either, many of them are posting this shit specifically to make the board react and become more racist.

It is important to recognize that people's preferences for romantic partners are highly individual and influenced by a range of factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, and social norms.
That being said, it is possible that some women may be attracted to Korean men for a variety of reasons. Korean culture has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the realm of entertainment, with the success of Korean dramas, music, and movies around the world. Some people may find Korean men attractive for their physical features, such as their style, fashion, or appearance. Additionally, some women may be drawn to Korean men because of their perceived qualities, such as their politeness, respectfulness, or commitment to family.
It is important to approach discussions about attraction with sensitivity and respect, and to avoid making sweeping generalizations or stereotypes about any particular group of people. Attraction is a complex and personal experience, and it is important to prioritize mutual respect and understanding in any relationship.

I'm also noticing that the Korea baiters have a very specific posting style, like this post here. It's always:
simple contradiction of statement
you must be coping
Over and over again.
<comment>
and u can never refute the claims
if u want to shut it down bring citations to the table. we know u cant thus we keep doing it.
<comment>
Koran guys cant be incels. Every nation of women on earth is in love with them. SEA women literally worship Korean male tourists. They were voted most handsome nationality by far.
<comment>
If you actually had citations you'd just fucking post them. You're fronting in the hopes that no one calls you on your BS.

don't you want someone to talk to about WHY specifically you enjoy that kind of sexual stimuli? come on OP, give us your valuable insight so we can gather as much information on what this site's majority demographic is actually like. we'll be able to provide you with new porn, better advertisements tailor suited to your personality and at the perfect times of day when you're most susceptible.

Citations on what? I don't know whats so hard to believe Women are flocking to Korea.
Plenty of people say it and agree with this notion except White men.
Heres my citation now refute it.
<comment>
It's a coping strategy - if you imply all men of your race are extremely desirable Chads to women, it means you're an extremely desirable Chad by proxy.
<comment>
nta but buggy prey eyes on men, like sylvester stallone or jared letos eyes, are disgustan. i agree with those blackpill schizos on that 100%. upper eyelid exposure on men is gross.
<comment>
i also dont understand why koreans cut their eyelids and make them double. leave them alone, unless you are a girl. manly monolids or very small amount of eyelid>>>>>buggy feminine prey eyes with tons of UEE

None of the white women I know are, and none of the white women they know are, so this as best a item of passing interest to a small minority of people, not something that deserves six threads on page fucking one.
Plenty of people say it and agree with this notion except White men.
Who cares what people say and agree with? People are often wrong. Even gookcels like you.
Heres my citation now refute it.
That's not a citation that's a screenshot. A citation is a link to an actual article. If you wanted me to care about Korea, you'd post the actual article instead.
<comment>
So you are going by your 'feelings' and your own personal experience of the people around you instead of logic.
Awwwwww how cute... your feely feel tells u different.
You are exactly what you complained about anon.
<comment>
It takes 2 seconds to google the article anon.
Im sure you will make an excuse for it with your non BIAS ofc opinion about it.

You can't cry about "logic" when you didn't actually post a citation. You don't get to hide behind the rules of formal debate when you failed to do the most basic thing they require.
Awwwwww how cute... your feely feel tells u different.
It doesn't "tell me different." I explained that none of the women in my life were "flocking to Korea" and then challenged you to make me care. You didn't because this is bait.
You are exactly what you complained about anon.
No, my only mistake is trying to talk to you like human being instead of just telling you kill yourself and filtering the word "Korea."
After visiting eight hostels and interviewing 123 women
There are one hundred fifteen million white women in the United States. You guys are good at math, what percent is 123/115,000,000?

Damn did you just do what you claimed Koreans are doing?
<comment>
Do you expect a study to include the whole population of South Korea.
But when it pertains to the positive reinforcement of White men its irrelevant the group size in studies?
You can keep coping all you want, but peoplekeep saying this for a reason. And the reason is its most likely true.

It's such a good look, they should wear them more often. I hate that zoomers have made baggy clothing fashionable

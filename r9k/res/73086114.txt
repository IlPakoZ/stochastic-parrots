I've been getting a clean hair cut for a few months now and shave my moustache and beard but nothing changed. People still think I'm hideous 
My only shot left is to lose a decent amount of weight so the fat 'melts' off my face and if that doesn't work it's over for me
I'm gonna be "that" guy.
fell for looksmaxxing
This is the wrong approach. The vast majority of women do not want to be sexually attracted to all the men in their lives. They have gay friends they wouldn't fuck, fat friends they wouldn't fuck, married friends they wouldn't fuck.
Are women happy to be with you to begin with? Are you fun? are you interesting? are you talented at something? There are many reasons why women would enjoy your company, even if you were really ugly (they just wouldn't want to fuck you).
Be sure that this is the case because this is crucial. If you're Chad, you can get away with having a shitty personality, but most guys aren't Chad. And all these below-average looking guys you see with girlfriends (even short, fat or ugly guys) most likely met their gf because they had women around them who liked them.
works on looks alone, actually improve appearance a little

"it's all about looks!"
Both statements are retarded. For non-Chads it's : personality -> confidence -> looks. If you have the three of them, congrats, you won't have any trouble getting girls. If you have personality and confidence, you're gonna be among the ugly guys who aren't virgins/single. 
Good luck, it's not over yet.

if my face was truly as good as people say it is I would've had a gf by now
Well it's over for me because I don't have a personality, hobbies or even a character. I'm a boring person
itkf my hairline also has receded over the years and is now in the danger zone
Personality is what's the most likely to change over the course of your life. Way more than looks.
Plenty of normal dudes were once lonely saddos. Focus on yourself, embrace being bald if you're ashamed of your hairline. 
Having no hobby / nothing going on in life is probably the biggest problem to fix.
how exactly do you suggest even getting the chance for women to get to know you?
Yeah but how do I feel emotions you know? I how can I care for other people 
I don't typically have empathy or sympathy and my mood and emotions are contentment or depressed with a lot of brain fog
Why do you say it's a meme? if people who have lost weight/gotten pretty lean and others who make themselves more physically attractive have gotten dramatically better results, are you saying they are liars?
These days, a guys needs a good face, eight and frame.
Fuck, are you me? It sucks to be a baldcel manlet.
I still get some compliments from unattainable women, but I have still never had an unpaid fuck at almost 37.
Correction.
i mean, is frame really that importatn? i've seen men will pretty small shitty frames still get girls because of their face.
It is generally considered to be part of that 'holy trinity'; but perhaps it is the least of the three.
If the guy with a shitty frame has a great face and has good/great height, then I guess he slays.
Have a bad face OR a bad height and it's fucking over. Let alone anyone who has bad face and height.

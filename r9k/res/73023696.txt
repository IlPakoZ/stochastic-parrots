I remember feeling like pic related for almost a year. It was the most beautiful feeling drugs can buy. I think about the memory every single day, and now what was the cost? I've been a NEET for 7 years now.
I lost my mental stamina, my physchial stamina. all of it. All i can think about is finding out how to source stims and feel like pic related for a few more months. Any robots here feel that way on drugs?
those days were so beautiful. I loved myself in such a different way. once I sobered up all i can say I just apperciate those memories.
sounds like you got sober without any help or community
a pretty important part of my sobriety is accepting how things are now and being with other sober people i can talk to about my feelings

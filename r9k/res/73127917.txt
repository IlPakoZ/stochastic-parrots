depressed all throughout high school
not know what to do after you graduated and decide to take a gap year
1 year of NEETdom turns into 9
 27-year-old ghost
being aware of the level of failure thus achieved feel that life is over, but also that there's nothing to lose anymore so decide to give life one last try
get a bachelors
almost finishing up a MA
soon be ready to start a PhD
+6 more years of grinding
feel that it's worth it since all the youth years were spent being depressed in one bedroom with no life prospects
maybe after getting that PhD and landing a 6-figure job within a couple of years after will have the effect of having self-esteem high enough to try to get into a situation that could lead to a first kiss or sexual act
but be relatively old by that point and not sure if to fall for the "women liking older men" meme
in any case, at least didn't let death find me without ever having fought to climb out of that pit

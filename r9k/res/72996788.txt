If they aren't normies, than they're just lolcows themselves farming lols from lolcows who they view as inferior to them. The cruelties of people know no bounds.

Normies don't really care about lolcows, mainly failed lolcows care about lolcows.
If you have emphaty for other human beings, even just watching them get hurt (physically or mentally), will hurt you.
If you see someone sadistically smile or enjoy people getting hurt, then you'll know to stay away from them, because they lack the emphaty to be trusted with emotions.
Do you laugh at people getting hurt...?

humans are demons. They just want to torture others deep down.

Nope. I feel bad for Chris Chan. If only he had gotten help earlier. If only people had stopped torturing him. I sincerely believe his state is due to the trolls. Chris Chan is out collective sin.

Very nice! 
I know plenty of normies that also feel the same way as you do, but I know others that think he's an amusing subhuman beast because they lack proper understanding of his situation.
It's a mixed bag.
I personally think it mainly boils down to stupidity and ignorance more than genuine evil, even if people that suffer from narcissistic tendencies might find enacting "divine judgement" on others to be pleasurable and righteous.
Just observe people to understand them. We mainly just want to do good, but we are all too stupid and end up hurting eachother and being evil more than needed and then we also have a bunch of bad actors that just play their own games, it's unfortunate to be alive.

I don't see the point in doing any more school, so my parents will no longer feed me. Fair enough, last time this happened I got a job and rented a room, but I don't see the point in that either.
I will probably live in a sleeping bag and play bongos and draw people for money. Saying that is the only thing that makes sense when people ask what I am going to do, everything else fills me with dread and sounds like a lie I'm saying to please someone or shy away from fear. But I am no longer afraid of this reality as I've taken steps toward it by openly failing out of school and regretting every moment I've spent in school.
Any robots ever be homeless, what is it like?

Being homeless is great. Everyone else makes it a chore.

The only thing holding me back is that is suck ass at bongos I only got them a couple days ago and need time to practice, which is why I got an extention for these clasess I'm failing, to have time to learn. Maybe I'm a retard and they'll just get stolen, but I don't think so, and even then I still have drawing

Honestly being homeless is only terrible if you happen to be addicted to hard drugs, like 80% of homeless people usually are. If you are not however and you are a 'normal' person who just so happens to be homeless, not only is being homeless not too bad of a predicament but getting out of it is MUCH easier. Depending on the country there are many many many programs/schemes to lift yourself out. I'm speaking from experience.

I don't use hard drugs and know not to, I have seen too many frens trapped by them. I don't see homelessness as a threat anymore, though avoiding it it was the only motivator for doing things my whole life, but more like a final destination for somebody as disagreeable as myself. Being liften out would be agreeing to more things, so I don't think I would if I chose to let Rome fall so to speak. It's not like working and renting is impossible, I just don't see the point of a normal life. But that it's harder to get out of than into is something to consider for sure.

dentists HATE this one simple trick
aight op, now you need pet antibiotics and to rinse w/ saline &amp; hydrogen peroxide daily until it's healed. You did the hard part, but you're not out of the woods until the gum heals without infection.
i'm probably just gonna do the rinsing with saline/hydrogen peroxide part as i have no antibiotics and hope for the best

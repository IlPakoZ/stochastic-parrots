If God truly was good and existed, He would punish all evil doers on Earth and eliminate suffering from those who follow Him. The punishment must also fit the crime and not be eternal torment. The fact He doesn't do this means He either doesn't exist or is evil for being complacent. It would also prove His existence if He actually took action.

free will is evil
Men make their own evil, it's their decision. If earth was designed to have no sin we may as well have never existed in the first place.

Evil is a choice but finite choices should not be met with infinite conscious punishment. God would seem good if the annihilationist belief (you burn in hell for some time and then cease to exist forever) was true but this is most likely just cope.
Those who commit evil interfere the free will of others. Right now we have a choice to not murder but we will be imprisoned for life if we do. We are imprisoned because we take the free will and joy away from others.

Why do you think one belief is likely a cope but the other not? Which seems more rational to you? People with free will have the right to intervene with other's. An ultimate power does not have free will, and so can't.

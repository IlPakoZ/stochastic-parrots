speaking as a black sperg it's hard to find girls in general. black women with the exception of one, haven't responded well to me. most women of other races don't pay attention to me, latin white asian etc. some white girls here and there like me because I'm "safe", I'm diet-black for the white girls who don't like gangbangers but can introduce me to their liberal family. even had a girl who wanted me to move in with her, but I like my place.

I do infact follow this girl and she does frequent spots in nature

the hoes in those photos arent black. they are more white than they are black. you don't really want a black girl do you?

Does she get naked?

They spent years being forced to be in nature.

These are like 1/8 black girls, OP.
<comment>
No. That's the best part anon

Thats not hiking or camping attire. I can guarantee the only time she goes outside is to take pictures of herself.

She's got a backpack. How is that not proper camping/hiking attire?

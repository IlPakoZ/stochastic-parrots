What's your ultimate power fantasy? Do you wish you were a musician? Secret agent? Astronaut? Roman Emperor? Cartel boss?

It would be cool to be a heavyweight boxer
<comment>
Definitely roman emperor. Would be so fucking sweet to live in a stone castle and rule Europe
<comment>
I want to conquer evolution and how fucked up the universe is. I want to make the universe my bitch for what it did to humanity
<comment>
a wife(bestfriend) and mother.

Spread my seed like Genghis

I am a witch
<comment>
Just being good looking would suffice
<comment>
Fantasy plus power does not equal power fantasy 
Some of your examples fit
<comment>
this. i actually just want to be giga chadrone and get a south korean wife
<comment>
What's your ultimate power fantasy?
Being able to engage in conversation with women consistently and having some kind of support system that involves women
<comment>
You know what? NO
FUCK what I said
My ultimate power fantasy is to not feel this need to be around people, to not give even a small piece of shit about women as a group.
If I was as powerful as I wanted to be, I would see a person, and feel nothing about them or their perception of me.
That's what I fucking want.
I want to not give a shit about other people unless it's something severe like people getting injured or killed, and even then, I only want to help them because of my principals. 
I don't want to be emotionally invested in human beings as human beings, only as living creatures
<comment>
I kinda wish I was a rockstar in 70s London
<comment>
I don't have power trips 
I have sperg trips 
crafting elaborate conspiracy theories 
socioeconomics of 4chan 
running civilizations perfectly
running a farm with max produce 
coding something super complex 
factorio 
I imagine myself building machinary that just works 
Story structure that just works 
Games that just work 
I am too lazy and hateful to do any of these ( except factorio ) though and I am stuck having to imagine perfection like the dumb little fucktard that I am

Being a God in the ancient sense. An extremely powerful being that can die but is only one of many Gods. I'd love to have the ability to fuck with mortals and lord over them. The Goa'uld in Stargate are pretty close to my ideal. Basically a tyrannical asshole that gets to play civilization/city builders and war strategy games with real people. 
A more "realistic" fantasy is being rich enough to buy huge areas of land and pay/encourage people to live and work there and using them to revive ancient cultures and religions. I'd have whole cities built for people to revive ancient dead cultures, languages and religions and just exist apart from the world.

My power fantasy? Having a loving wife that wouldn't never cheat on me, a house, a work from home job and maybe some children? Idk about that right now but that's what i wish for, boring but i don't care
<comment>
You can do it too, anon. Turn family trees into family circles!

<comment>
Actually I notice you didn't specify realism or not, you just gave several realistic examples
To achieve physical and mental prowess and abilities FAR beyond that of what human beings think is possible or even conceivable.
I don't care what people think of me, and I don't care if I have a woman
I just want to have ultimate power, then nothing they say or do will fucking matter to me. 
I would go and live in nature and have the time of my fucking life launching my body 50 feet into the air with ease and landing with no strain or effort
Being able to see in the complete dark, being able to hold my breath for hours at at time and dive down to the deep reaches of the ocean, while still being extremely strong and agile within that realm of water pressure.
Jumping from tree-top to tree-top in the rainforest, knocking large and old trees over with ease (not that I would do that needlessly).
Then
Harassing and terrorizing human settlements and congregations. Destroying factories, rendering logging operations and oil/frakking platforms inoperable, finding ways to move landfills and other large sources of trash right into the middle of every day life. 
If I could, I would drop load 100 tons of garbage onto a barge and drop it right in the middle of time square, right on hollywood boulevard, all over buckingham palace, and in the other places in the other parts of the world that are equivalent that I'm ignorant of

There are height standards for donating sperm.
<comment>
Being a,witch in the woods, luring moids in, making them write all tgeir property to my name by magic and then skinning them alive
<comment>
Didn't consider that lmao. I'll go to SEA and do it manually.
<comment>
What's your ultimate power fantasy?
Harem of Korean girls at my full disposal
<comment>
alternatively, I want the ability to turn into a huge red dragon lol
<comment>
I wish I was an interdimensional traveller, with access to a pocket universe that only I can enter. Collecting mementos from all the universes I visit, learning about alternate histories, languages, and cultures.
Or maybe someone with the ability to warp reality. conjure up money to pay the bills, travel around the world with just a thought, being able to help any people who I come across.
<comment>
ugh look over there it's Anon
ew
Why does Zeus even keep inviting him to these things? 
ikr
At least Hephaestus can make useful stuff, all Anon does is creep on human women 
I heard he actually spends time helping mortals build cities lmao what a weirdo
Yeah, apparently he threw a fit over some of them not "being up to code" and made then start the sanitation system all over again 
why does he care about human toilets lmao? He's the God of simps not the God of poor isn't he?
he is, he does the sanitation stuff for free, not even a prayer in exchange
<comment>
I want to be a god of fertility. Reside in a huge monastery, have people come to me for fertility problems. Just being in my presence alone increases potency, touching the fabric of my clothes is enough to cure infertility, holding hands ensures a spontaneous pregnancy, and actually receiving my divine seed brings a minimum of 8 children. People would make models of my penis, using it as a good luck charm in conceiving. Fertility clinics would only exist because the wait list to see me would be miles long. I could have any woman I wanted as my high priestess/divine concubine. People would make statues of me, likely naked ones. I could gain favors of any nation I want so long as I ensured the old farts in charge of nations could get a boner. But mostly I'd live a comfy life in a comfy monastery.

Ugly Bastard with Fuck Powers
<comment>
You're a fag and if I was a god I'd find you and I'd rip off your head and make you eat your own shit as your body voided itself
<comment>
I want to expose dirty secrets and go out like jfk
<comment>
Jews, anon, the answer is always Jews.
<comment>
Esoteric shaman type that tapped into the void, an immaterial plane that mirrors our own. I sustain myself through the nebulous void energies swirling around so I don't need to eat or shit, I can't die etc, and I have work to do that is more important than anyone who ever lived.
<comment>
be me
waifu in alt universe 
i'm the one who got suicided
<comment>
Either this >>73147819 or a random power that seems stupid at first but becomes powerful after I learn to use it in creative ways, like in Jojo.
<comment>
I just want to be rich enough to be able to do anything I want whenever I want. I would spend most of my time raising animals to eat
<comment>
Committing moid genocide. Think hitler minus the retardation because of his male brain. I would get males to fight for me because of their tard strength and the later execute them all.
<comment>
Having my brain transferred to a robot body.
<comment>
Scientist with his own lab and workshop. Easy access to the internet and enough funds to purchase whatever I'd need for my own experiments.
<comment>
When I was a teen I had Death Note power fantasies and overpowered underestimated anime protagonist ones too.
<comment>
I wish I could be a flying ghost with the ability to shut off every sense on command
<comment>
Very accurate to greek mythology
<comment>
I like these. 
I just want to have a harem of hot anime men. Especially jjk men, god theyre hot.
<comment>
I have the standard "save the princess" fantasies a lot. Built a significant universe in my head about it because I spend a lot of time at work daydreaming
<comment>
I want to lead a commune. 
Like, a little comfy self sufficient village of 30 or so people, cut off from the world.
I actually own a plot of land in the middle of nowhere and have a few thousand uros you could make something out of, but I'm an asocial retard who can't lose his v card, let alone charm people like Jim Jones or whoever else.
<comment>
I wish I was a post-rock musician. Or some sort of cool indie rock musician. That's my power fantasy.
<comment>
I wish I had a superpower where I could telepathically moan in womens minds. They see me and hear me moaning.
<comment>
I want to be god honestly
<comment>
Best one so far. Might as well end the thread here

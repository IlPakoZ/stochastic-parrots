It isn't worth it to get excited about a game anymore because you don't know if it will be finished, when it will release, or if it will just be crap. I got Forza 5 and I consider it to be probably the stupidest thing I've ever done with money.
developers realized that they could half-ass it and gamers would still buy, so they stopped caring. Ubiquitous broadband was a big help to them in enabling that kind of attitude, too. Also the market is bigger, once upon a time repeat customers were far more important than they are now. With endless millions of casuals around, if you fuck up it doesn't matter, some of them would have drifted away anyway, and new ones will show up to play whatever the current thing is no matter how badly you botched the last game. Plus that large audience means that AAA games now tend to get made like movies, and tend to be beautiful but suck for all the same reasons.

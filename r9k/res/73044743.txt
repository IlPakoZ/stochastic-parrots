I fall into murderous, borderline psychotic rages when I go off my SSRIs. To the point where I want everybody on the planet to die and not in an edgy way, but in a very sincere homicidal way.
I don't know what to do about it.

Sounds like a skill issue. Might want to improve.

Sounds unhealthy, Anon. You should think about talking to a therapist

max strength legal dosages of many different ssri's here. 
They were all sugar pills and going off of them gave me a slight headache for a few days and then nothing. Its a psyop and its an excuse for your wrath to come to the surface. Stop being an emotional faggot and control yourself

Don't listen to this poster Anon. Embrace your hatred

This reply makes me wish very bad things happen to you.
I don't believe in therapy. I've tried it in the past and it was a waste of time. I think "therapy culture" is a sign that we are a terminal society on the brink of annihilation.
You're wrong. It was happening even before I made the connection, so it literally can't be a placebo.
I don't want to embrace my hatred. I've always seen myself as a very loving, compassionate person.

Same, anon. I've been on SSRIs for literally 15 years. Same shit, only one dosage change. I know it's zombification poison, but it dulls the terror and fear of the world to some degree, and strongly diminishes my (actual) OCD, which for anyone who hasn't dealt with it, has no fucking idea how painful and miserable it is.
I went off them for a few months a while back, and would often fall into crying fits, break shit in my house, and threaten to assault people. As you say, it's not some edgy, homicidal bullshit; it's that everything becomes such a fucking nightmare to deal with without your jewish numbing chemicals that you're ready to rip a building apart just to avoid dealing with anyone for any reason. 
I love you thought, I know it's fucking hard. You're not the only one who has had this awful experience, I promise.

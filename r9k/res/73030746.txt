Being a good looking mentalcel is literal fucking Hell on Earth
be me
get added on Instagram by a 4/10 black girl from Gambia
kinda weird, but I'm bored and have nothing to do, so I go along with it
she literally says that she added me because I'm hot
ask her what's it like in Gambia
she says that it's difficult, but that she's getting by
tell her that as long as she's getting by, that's ok
she says "sure bro"
gets ghosted
I am 22 years old and still a virgin. I got rejected by 200 lbs landwhales, and now literal african village girls don't want me. All this despite getting rated 8/10 on /soc/ and being told numerous times IRL that I'm hot. LITERALLY NOTHING can save you from autism, not even looking like a fucking model. When I meet my dad in heaven, I am going to beat the living shit out of him for all eternity just for subjecting me to this horrifically agonizing existence.

wouldn't being an ugly mentalcel be even worse

LITERALLY NOTHING can save you from autism
Except actually talking to girls who are into anything you're into, or you could just get common interests like vidya and find a gf that way.
Being an actual incel would leave him suicidal over his way now of just bragging on /r9k/.
<comment>
At least when you're ugly, you can just accept that it's your genetics, but in my case, if I was raised differently (i.e. if my obese retard dad didn't die of a preventable disease when I was 10 and didn't leave me to be raised by an extremely neurotic single mom) I would have experienced love AT LEAST FUCKING ONCE in my life.
Did you even read my fucking post? If I get rejected by landwhales and below average girls from the poorest african countries, THEN EXPLAIN HOW THE FUCK am I supposed to make it with le gaymurr gurls OF ANY FUCKING KIND?
<comment>
If you're actually an 8/10 and get approached on IG then you shouldn't approach girls IRL. That's a fool's errand. A gaymurr girl online who shares an interest will be far easier to talk to and women online primarily care about looks, so if you actually try, some will probably carry convos.
You seem just really unhinged/low IQ, though.

mandem doesnt know fags on /soc/ gas everyone up for cock and butthole pics
<comment>
you can just accept that it's your genetics
just accept that it's your upbringing then lol
<comment>
im so autistic i assume every female adding me on ig is a bot. we are not the same.

The african girl that just rejected me was an entirely online interaction, why would an interaction with a gamer girl from a first world country go any better.
unhinged/low IQ
I have a tested IQ of 129 and I am only unhinged when anonymous.
More than half of the rates were girls, *blud*.
Everyone on this board is hurr durr just be Chad when it's blatantly wrong. Being neurotypical is THE ONLY FUCKING THING that matters.
I kneel.
<comment>
Post face to unsee or you're LARPing. This is a really boring LARP.
<comment>
I don't need to prove anything. I know for myself that everything I said is true. Being NT is the only thing that matters.
<comment>
if you have asperger's just get a gf with asperger's, if you were actually autistic you'd be too busy watching tv shows for children
<comment>
just get a gf with asperger's
First, how would I even be able to tell?
Second, where?
Third, girls with aspergers are repulsed by guys with aspergers anyway.
<comment>
Being a good looking mentalcel is literal fucking Hell on Earth
So then why the fuck are you posting on 4chan instead of just killing yourself, reteard? Anyone who posts an "X has it so hard" or an "X has it so easy" thread should be permabanned.
<comment>
If you're that good looking go to the club and maybe get a drink or 2. Some drunk girl will probably to talk to you and then ask her to dance (only after talking a bit). Grind on her and have some fun, rince and repeat. Don't try once and quit after failing.
<comment>
I did that and went on several dates this year doing this, but I was ghosted right after, and they probably gossiped about how much of a loser I was too.
<comment>
your third point literally contradicts the first two
<comment>
No, I was asking you where to even MEET them, and then I stated that I would fail at making them my gfs anyway.
<comment>
Why is it you think you're a loser?
<comment>
You've got a negative attitude, buddy, that's your problem. You're probably confusing your social anxiety for autism like most people on this board. If you think you'll disappoint every woman you meet then you're going to end up doing exactly that, it's called a self-fulfilling prophecy, look it up.
And while you're at it, grow a pair.
<comment>
I'm a 22 year old virgin.
Yeah, bro, I get ghosted because of le negative thoughts. And no, I don't go in with that expectation at all, you gaslighting fuck.
And while you're at it, grow a pair.
I bet I approached more girls than you, boomer dipshit.
<comment>
are you that guy that does rowing or something
<comment>
No. Who are you even referring to?
<comment>
You said you'd fail at making them your gfs anyway for no apparent reason, don't call me a boomer just because I told you to quit being a pussy and take control of your life
<comment>
quit being a pussy and take control of your life
What is that even supposed to mean?
<comment>
gaslight yourself into thinking women like your personality until you realise it's true
<comment>
Then I would have to give myself brain damage, because getting ghosted is a very clear indicator that women do not, in fact, like my personality.
<comment>
That's not a reason to believe you are a loser. You put too much stock in a woman choosing to have sex with a dude. Your lack of it isn't a reflection of a character flaw.
<comment>
I'm saying you should distract yourself with other fun things in life because when you focus too much on the women that ghost you it makes it even worse
<comment>
It's called continuing the conversation. "Oh yeah? What's so hard about it?" Literally segues you into a full convo that you can redirect into stuff about yourself at some point so you both get to know each other better.
<comment>
If you're an adult male virgin, you're simply at the bottom of the normie social hierarchy. Others see you as pathetic garbage and nothing you say will change that fact. My lack of it is a very clear reflection of being a social defect.
Not having experienced a single intimate relationship is miserable and any claim otherwise is just gaslighting.
I had multiple hour conversations on dates before. Still got ghosted afterwards.
<comment>
Not having experienced a single intimate relationship is miserable and any claim otherwise is just gaslighting.
I don't disagree, but it will only get worse the older you are and not doing anything about it won't get you out of your predicament
<comment>
not doing anything about it
I have done everything short of buying a prostitute when it comes to getting laid.
<comment>
You focus too much on getting laid and too little on living a life that will attract women, that's what I'm trying to tell you
<comment>
I say fuck that shit (not op). Don't live a life for attention from women, live one that makes him genuinely happy. You're suggesting what I was against, being dependent on them for your happiness/not feeling like a loser.
<comment>
*(not op btw) is what I meant to write.
<comment>
Anon, normies start having sex in high school, when they don't have anything close to an exciting life.
I have a need for intimate relationships with women. Sure, my life can have more than that, but without it, I will forever be miserable.
<comment>
I hear what you're saying, but it's not healthy. I'm not going to spew bs and say "just be confident bro". I just want you to be happy and relying on someone so fickle for your happiness is leading to disaster. If you decide to dedicate so much of your energy to this, just please stop feeling like a loser while you're at it.
<comment>
Your brain has clearly been ruined by this place, bro. Stop thinking of yourself as a failure because you missed out on sex in high school, plenty of guys have as well and they have no problem getting laid later in life. I think your lack of self-esteem is what drives women away, from your replies here you sound like you've already given up on life completely just because you didn't get poon before your 18th.
<comment>
I think your lack of self-esteem is what drives women away
You normies always say this, but never specify how. On my last date with a fat girl, we talked for 2 hours about a wide range of topics. How exactly did my "lack of self-esteem" ruin it?
<comment>
you don't sound autistic you just sound really boring and you didn't make it sexual so she got even more bored you fucking idiot lmao
next time just pretend to be a chad fuckboy, get overtly sexually flirtatious, see what happens
<comment>
I can't tell what happened in that exact scenario because you're not giving me enough information but if you sound anything like you do in this thread it's obvious to the people you talk to, you're hard on yourself for no real reason
<comment>
Did she have a fat ass at least?
<comment>
it's obvious to the people you talk to, you're hard on yourself for no real reason
preach, you need help OP (I'm not making fun of you or putting you down).
<comment>
I would fuck that up immensely, humiliate myself, and become an even bigger laughing stock than I already am.
Further context
be me
at club/bar
dancing
she walks up to me and we start dancing together
she asks me if I want to sing with her (it was karaoke night)
do that
proceed to make out afterwards
talk to her for an hour after the club closes
ask her out, she says yes
go on date
ask for a second one, get rejected
Mistakes I remember making on the date:
the walk to the bar was too long
I forgot what her favorite car was, accidentally said the completely wrong brand during conversation
stuttered horribly at one point
took the wrong way walking back, had to turn around
tried to kiss her on the forehead as a goodbye, ended up kissing her hair
No, but she did have fat tits.
<comment>
stuttered horribly at one point
This is the only real mistake I see, unless you forgot something else. She was probably turned off by your demeanor, which likely comes from the fact that you took the date too seriously because you feel like you're already behind "normies". If she walked up to you and you made out with her then I don't see how you keep getting rejected.
I would fuck that up immensely, humiliate myself, and become an even bigger laughing stock than I already am.
I disagree with that anon's methods but you're being way too pessimistic again
<comment>
she did have fat tits.
Sounds like you kind of missed out. Oh well, if American you'll find plenty of busty girls. Doesn't sound like it's hard for you to get their attention so keep your chin up.
<comment>
She was probably turned off by your demeanor, which likely comes from the fact that you took the date too seriously because you feel like you're already behind "normies"
You are almost starting to agree with me. Yes, she was turned off by my demeanor, BUT my demeanor is caused by being raised by a single mother, growing up obese (again, my parents' fault, I'm lean now btw), and being mercilessly ridiculed by everyone my entire life. No matter what goes on inside my head, positive or negative, I will always be a socially defective sperg and no woman in the world can tolerate this. After going on God knows how many dates, I still commit a social faux pas every single time, no fail. Thinking positively does not prevent this.
you're being way too pessimistic again
I have a reputation as a sperg cringelord among my peers. I'm just being realistic.
<comment>
so keep your chin up
Every day I'm bombarded with reminders that I'm a failure.
<comment>
im sure everyone has already given you the same good advice that youve ignored and convinced yourself isnt true but ill try anyways and give braindead step by step:
be you
fly to a random city where you dont know anybody
walk around random neighborhood
dont let yourself come back to your hotel until youve had 10 unique conversation with 10 people
a conversation is defined as you say at least 3 things and they respond to each thing
by unique I mean you cant just use the same script each time, each convo needs to be at least somewhat different
this is like working out a muscle. 3 reps (3 lines of dialogue), 10 sets.
the next day repeat in a new neighborhood
repeat for 1 week
fly home
repeat this exercise regularly by driving to unfamiliar locations
work towards conversations outside the default script with strangers in daily life: cashiers, bus driver, old people, men, women 
work towards banter 
be you in 1 year
autism gone
i dont care what cope retard shitpost youre dreaming up to reply to me about why this wont work. it works 10/10 times it worked for me it worked for everyone ive told it to it will work for you
<comment>
I'm usually against this, but you should seriously seek a therapist (a male one who is older). You need some sort of male mentor/father figure. You don't deserve this, you need help to stop yourself from beating yourself up. Me and the other anon are trying to encourage you, but you just keep beating us down. We can't help you, so please seek help. I'm not saying this to shame you, so don't be agitated by my words. Good luck.
<comment>
each convo needs to be somewhat different
work towards banter
Aaand this is the subjective part of your normie advice that I, as a sperg, will inevitably fail. If I chat up 100s of people, there will inevitably be similar conversations, and my attempts at banter will most likely put me in dangerous/humiliating situations.
I've been to therapists and psychiatrists since I was 7 years old. They don't do shit.
<comment>
my demeanor is caused by being raised by a single mother, growing up obese (again, my parents' fault, I'm lean now btw), and being mercilessly ridiculed by everyone my entire life
Well that explains a lot, but you can still choose to not think of yourself as a failure, because your upbringing is not your fault. If you've stopped being obese (which is a major feat some people never achieve), you can stop being spergy too. The first step to that, as I've stated before, is to stop seeing yourself as a sperg.
<comment>
genuinely hope you kill yourself tonight for that retarded fucking reply but luckily ill continue to help you despite your pathetic tantrum
if I chat up 100s of people there will be similar conversations
- I didnt say 100s of convos need to be different, just the 10 for any given walk
- Similar != The same. Youre allowed similar convos
- If you happen to have the same convo, you dont die. You dont fail. That convo just doesnt count towards your 10. We are just trying to collect diversity here, perfection is not required.
dangerous/humiliating situations
Humiliating? Yes, thats the point. Each time you are humiliated you learn something you shouldnt have said. Since you are talking to strangers who dont live near you there are 0 consequences. It feels bad in the moment, which is good, because it teaches you something through negative reinforcement. Any autist on the planet will eventually improve at conversing if this happens enough times
Dangerous? Avoid dudes who look huge or dudes who look sketchy. Dont go to a fucking ghetto. Stick to safe places during daylight
Fuck you for making me reply. I gave you perfect advice that will fix your issues and you just plucked two pathetic easily dismantled excuses out of thin air to lean onto so that you dont have to seriously consider the advice. I get that its tempting and cozy to pretend that your current failure isnt your fault but its empowering to realize the flipside of that coin is your future is in your hands

Ugly and short men, why are you not asexual eunuch platonic entities that psychonically read womens minds to know your place in their hierarchy of fuckable and unfuckable friends before you engage your basic human sex drive and love drive? Why do you insist on having a sexuality? You are useful the way you are, there is no need to fall in love or have a sexuality. There are more attractive men to serve that purpose for women.
If you are befriending a women to get in her pants then you are a POS creep. If you develop feelings for her then you should either express it or cut her off. Don't stick around someone you want to love/fuck but can't.
Why do you find it okay to objectify men?
I agree, but any man under the age of 21 should be excused for this behavior. It's just a part of growing up, learning that you have to make your intentions clear.
If you are befriending a women to get in her pants then you are a POS creep
Nope, doesn't happen except in fantasies and if it does you're okay when tall handsome men do it.
You are pathologizing normal healthy sexuality in men you are imagining are short and ugly. Women are flattered and happy when tall handsome men do this.
You speak like an inexperienced baby child who thinks the world is full of villains out to get you. There are no "intentions" described in the OP pic, just the natural progression to falling in love.
There is no le magical contract that states men must remain asexual eunuch platonic entities if you find them ugly and short. If you know you won't ever want to recognize their basic human sexuality its on you to inform them that you find them ugly and short from the start and that you can never see them as having a basic human sexuality, so they know the bounds of your friendship and that you've placed them in the lower tier of unfuckable friends (as opposed to the fuckable friends/FWBs).
If you are befriending a women to get in her pants then you are a POS creep
Not depicted in the OP and impossible to prove. You are assigning motive based on other criteria, and we all know what those criteria are for the Chads (beautiful romantic just fell in love) vs non-Chad (evil machinations befriending to evily get in le pants)
ugly and short men don't need to fall in love or have a sexuality
ugly and short women need to fall in love and have a sexuality
How does this make sense? This is core of the issue today. Women can objectify men on every front, using every metric, but to do the same to women is "shaming" them. This is the whole problem, the entire view as to why things are so fucking skewed right now. They are no scrutinized the way we are.
she has a good male friend
I feel like people who have to emphasis that they've had "[a] good friend[s]" aren't really good at differentiating between good and bad friends.
You should know that you're a creep and that its morally wrong to fall in love with women who have placed you in the friend box if you don't pass certain height and handsomeness criteria. It means you were plotting in your evil villain lair to get in her pants by pretending to be her friend. But if you're tall and handsome, then feel free to fall in love spontaneously, it's very romantic when he falls for his friend and he's hot.
more like they're bad friends who dehumanize (desexualize) others. he was one of her uglier friends so he was expected to inherently know to "stay in his lane". He's probably watched her fuck a few other friends who tried the same thing he did, but succeeded because they had the genetics of height and face to pull it off.
will you date me?
ew no.
ok, I'm going to find someone else to date.
NOOOOOOO YOU ARE NEGLECTING OUR FRIENDSHIP! REEEEEE!
You should know that you're a creep and that its morally wrong to fall in love with women who have placed you in the friend box if you don't pass certain height and handsomeness criteria.

Yeah, that's how the situation is today, except a 'creep' is any male who fails to meet the male standard that women set for us.
basically he chose not to be a desexualized orbiter simp and she's enraged he didn't know his place.
give simple, sensible opinion
receieve butthurt paragraph in return
You must know that I did not read beyond the first sentence of your reply.
i can see your hands shaking in anger through your post.
receive paragraph
Where? I see a few sentences at best.
she got trashed and assblasted and is trying to save face by appearing like she's not seething.
Yeah. It's not a sin that warrants death penalty.
Nice strawman
So you were never a real friend but a liar creep?
this is not very good bait, do better.
the thing is if a woman really wanted to be a friend, and a guy made a move on her she would set him up with another girl or became a wingman for him
but she doesn't want a friend, she doesn't even care she was hit on she'd just rather get attention from complaining online than to have a friend
Please do not ever 'befriend' a woman. Learn from my mistake, there are no 'one of the guys' or 'y-yeah but she's different'
Keep it 100% professional and detached from women co workers as well, that's an even bigger hassle in some ways.
How am I baiting? What if you have a gay friend and he gets attracted to you but doesn't disclose it? How would you feel knowing that all that friendship was a masquerade to get into your pants?
You just don't to feel guilty for treating unattractive men poorly.
she sees the guy as a utility. she cannot comprehend that an ugly man she has utilized for a certain "platonic" purpose has an internal cognitive life and experiences emotions and has a male sexuality. men who aren't extremely physically attractive are seen by her as eunuchs and it was shocking and offensive to her for him to demonstrate that he was not and like any man, has the capacity to fall in love.
no man would be enraged that a friend of his, gay guy or straight woman, had to put distance between the two of them because they loved him so much and it hurt to be around him, because they understand that people aren't just utilities to serve a purpose and have inner emotional lives.
This is going to blow your mind because you're a leftoid retard, but the 2 genders are different from eachother and this hypothetical is moot.
I would feel flattered that someone found me that attractive and if he needed to put space between us indefinitely to heal or move on I'd wish him the best, because that's what any decent person would feel about their friend.
He certainly isn't my slave eunuch utility that has to disclose in writing all his emotions he might ever experience in the future over the course of his natural normal human sexuality and emotional states.
wow, women really do not understand men psychologically. such a thing would be seen as unfortunate because of the heartbreak for the gay man, and you would feel sad for him as a man because his heart has been broken. plus as a man your confidence would be invigorated and improved by that experience.
are women really this psychologically blind when it comes to men?
He certainly isn't my slave eunuch utility that has to disclose in writing all his emotions he might ever experience in the future over the course of his natural normal human sexuality and emotional states.
And when did I say he must do that.I have only said one thing so far that if you are attracted to a girl then either confess or just silent cut her off. Don't hand around her with burden of infatuation over you believing you might have a chance one day. It makes you predatory and exploiting someone's trust.
Nice goalpost change. It's tragic and shitty for everyone but that doesn't mean you can't be blamed.
you are not speaking of any experience related to OPs image. it is impossible to prove intentions of a person without inner access to their minds.
just because a man is ugly and short, it doesn't mean he was hanging around to predate on a woman.
and just because a man is tall and handsome doesn't mean his intentions were pure and romantic.
just knock it off. stop inventing scenarios, and making claims about peoples intentions. unless you can show us audio and video access of their inner thoughts and emotions. 
ugly men have a right to have a spontaneous sexuality that changes like human beings too, not only tall handsome men. they are not predatory and exploiting trust for being humans with evolving sexualities (as in the OP image/post and thus the only valid topic of this conversation).
They DO IT TO AVOID GUILT Ch/Tyrone isn't told he is being A CREEP for the same behavior they are natural hypocrites but cannot fucking admit it
that's true. No one with self respect wants to be a girl's gay best friend. Girls don't understand that finding and maintaining a girlfriend is a full time job. 
hey do you want to get coffee with me, your non-girlfriend?
I can't. I have to spend the next six hours trying to set up a tindr date without getting ghosted.
hey do you want to go shopping with me, your not-girlfriend, for the rest of the day? 
I can't. I have to join a church and a cooking class and take dance lessons in hopes a girl there is single. 
hey, do you want to help me move all my furniture into a box truck and haul it to my new apartment? 
that sounds like fun, but there's an actual girl who wants my dick now, and I'm not going to blow her off to spend the day with the friendzone queen 
Priorities. Every moment a man spends with you is a moment he spends away from his wife. You are not more important than his wife. Remember that.
using phrases like "goalpost change" its important to understand their meaning first. just trying to use them randomly to seem intelligent won't work, you'll be called out for it as i'm doing here.
come back with a counterpoint to my on topic right down the middle argument and stop flailing dishonestly.
just because he is short and ugly, doesn't mean he is evil and "to blame"
Any other females find it funny and pathetic when women write paragraphs about how they pretend to give a damn about male value.
I'm a male writing this i wanted male friendships before but now i really don't give a fuck anymore 
the question i always ask why would you want male friendships in the first place? kek
She implied that men involve themselves in the relationships just to have a chance and I agreed that some men do. She is also rightful paranoid is that what I was saying. You are just spiteful.

Horrendous logic 
come back with a counterpoint to my on topic right down the middle argument and stop flailing dishonestly.
But I did.
Because people like being around other people? My best friends during childhood were girls.
Horrendous logic
How so?
She implied that men involve themselves in the relationships just to have a chance
Yep, and its acceptable to her when men who are tall and handsome do it and not when men who are short and ugly do it.
You are a simp, the kind of man who would actually do what you're suggesting other men do. She will not reward you with sex for validating her online.
Your continuous dishonesty and admission to being the gay friend for girls shows us you have a feminine mind.
Commit to honesty. Short ugly men are allowed to have spontaneous sexualities, to try to set up FWBs situations out of friendships, and to put distance between them and women who tell them they're eunuch utilities by rejecting them. Not only tall and handsome men should be allowed to have sexualities.
She implied that men involve themselves in the relationships just to have a chance 
Impossible to know without direct magical access to the inner thoughts and emotions of other people. She is assigning good/bad intentions to men based on how physically attractive she finds them.
Proof foids are narcissistic: she expects anyone with an iota of self respect to waste their time reading her seething malding blogpost
Imagine actually letting a woman know how you feel about her. Imagine not being a coward.
That's exactly what happened in OPs post. He spontaneously developed feelings for her, and told her. She and you are now seething that he didn't opt to remain a desexed asexual eunuch utility.
You are not owed slavish pseudofriendship. Short and ugly men are allowed to have sexualities too, despite your protestations, not only tall and handsome men.
Men don't just spontaneously develop feelings. They know within the first two weeks that they want to fuck her. Within the first two days, usually. If he's not a coward, he'll let her know. He'll make a move.
Men don't just spontaneously develop feelings
Prove it.
Because they're not women. Women are fickle, men are not. Men see their target, they make efforts to reach it. It's so simple it barely warrants explanation. Beta males just confuse this process through their own lack of confidence.
What are friends?
You are just playing a spiteful victim here.

Mental derangement. Nobody said otherwise.
If that's the case then all male sexuality no matter how direct is predatory, and thus it is not unusual or wrong to try to get sex via friendship and clever manipulation.
You have cornered yourself. Better luck next time.
Short ugly men are allowed to have spontaneous and evolving sexuality, not only tall handsome men. Do you understand?
Don't seethe about it, just be honest about it.
Women are not fickle. They know upon first sight whether or not they're attracted to a man because unlike with men where attraction can develop over time, women instantly fall in love with tall height and handsome face or are instantly disgusted by short height or ugly face.
IT ALWAYS MEN FAULT
MEN LE BAD
all male sexuality no matter how direct is predatory, and thus it is not unusual or wrong to try to get sex via friendship and clever manipulation
Did you think I would disagree?
Short ugly men are allowed to have spontaneous and evolving sexuality, not only tall handsome men. Do you understand? 
Sure but don't go around pretending to be a friend when you aren't. 
I will totally not creeped out if some gay dude pretended to be my friend to get in my pants
Then its morally righteous for men to try to trick their female friends into sex by emotional proximity.
I accept your concession.
Short ugly men who have sexuality aren't evil nonfriends, they can be friends with spontaneous sexual needs of women they're friends with, just like tall handsome men.
 What are friends?
Let me answer that since he didn't: they're not emotional parasites. I don't give a fuck about how you got ghosted or you feel inadequate, just as you don't care to listen to that shit from me.
Fuck yourself
because girls and boys cannot be friends, only collogues, acquaintances, significant other or sexual partner
id never have a gay friend
morally righteous
You start using spook terms like this and you have no argument in the first place. The reality is that nobody likes being deceived. That man who pretends friendship is a rat attempting to gnaw at a woman's heart and worm his way in. Of course we hold him in contempt.
only simps and women would hold a man in contempt just because he is short and ugly doing and has a sexuality.
there is no pretending friendship. fwbs exist and thus it is normal to make friends with the unexpressed intention of fucking them in the future.
unless you think fwbs should be a jailable offense, you inherently agree with me.
More crazy logic. Whatever intellectual victory you think you have here pales in comparison to the reality that your faux-friendship will be seen as the creepy, cowardly attempt to get pussy that it is.
There's really nothing you can explain to a person with a personality disorder.
i don't think all women have personality disorders, that's a bold suggestion. i just think they need to accept that short ugly men are humans with sexualities too, not just tall handsome men. do you really believe that ALL women are personality disordered? seems like a stretch.
Kind of wrong desu. Its just that men are told to base their self worth on how many they could shag that they are pushed into pursuing any women they interact with. 
there is no pretending friendship. fwbs exist and thus it is normal to make friends with the unexpressed intention of fucking them in the future. 
Are you autistic? Do you think friends in fwb imply that someone got into that kind of relationship by deceiving other party? Do you think he/she used their friendship as a tool to fuck someone?
 Men are told to want to be horny
How much more retarded can you get?
I don't care to brag to anyone, sex is just fun. The same reason you hook up with at least 3 random dudes a year, if not far more
It is even creepier when you remember things you did together with him, like sleepovers, movie nights, and you realize he was probably masturbsting on you sleeping or sniffing your underwear. Like can you please not be a shifty predator pretending to like my personality, thanks.
Do you think friends in fwb imply that someone got into that kind of relationship by deceiving other party?
Do you think he/she used their friendship as a tool to fuck someone?
These happen more often than you think.
no you fucking loser. kill yourself. men and women cannot naturally be friends. they have complete distinct interests and desires. maybe a married man and married woman can be friend or young children but yeah kill yourself
Do you think friends in fwb imply that someone got into that kind of relationship by deceiving other party?
all the time it is nearly universal. and its morally good when tall handsome men do it and their motives pure and romantic, and its morally evil when short ugly men do it and they are deceitful and cunning incels.
What are friends? 
News flash. When guys get a girlfriend, they drop their guy friends. It happens a lot. Guy I knew since elementary school? Hung out with him every day. Played video games and shit from 1st grade to 11th grade. Every weekend. Every summer. For a decade. One day in high school he gets a girlfriend. We didn't hang out anymore. That's that. Good job, Kevin, got yourself a girlfriend. It happens. And sometimes guys are salty about it, but I wasn't bitter. I understood that a girlfriend is important, and I certainly wasn't going to fuck Kevin. That's gay. Why can't you be happy for Kevin?
And yet it's not okay to ask out women you don't know. What do we do then? There's way too little wiggle room, it's never the rigt time to ask out it seems. Ofc, asking a girl out never goes well unless you're Chad, he can ask them out whenever he wants.
You should be angry about that originally
Why? Another year and we were off to different colleges, anyway. Now we're in different countries.
You are extremely dumb and naive.
This 
Yes but it's bad when things don't work out in the end.
Stupid incel
Keep parroting yourself 
Ok but what are you trying to say?
Difference between being a friend and someone in one's social circle. Most friendships don't evolve into sexual relationships or Romantic ones.
Why the Fuck is she surprised that random men dont straight up start their interactions with women by suggesting a romantic relationship?
Yes but it's bad when things don't work out in the end.
That's most relationships. In fact, it's most friendships too.
Buddy
Serious question
Have you ever been around girls
Ever
"I want a romantic relationship" is a little much when first meeting a girl, but men should absolutely communicate attraction early on if they're interested in the girl. Unless you're Chad she won't make the first move so it's on you to get the ball rolling. If you don't she'll assume you're not into her and then you're friendzoned, no matter how much you do want to date/fuck her. I think that's how most of the stories like OP's pic unfold.
guy is into girl but is too pussy to say anything
goes along with the friendzone
years later he finally shoots his shot
the girl is totally oblivious that he was attracted to her and feels betrayed or like all he ever wanted was to get laid
he seethes over wasting all that time on her when it could have been easily avoided if he let his intentions be known early on, she either would have reciprocated or rejected him on day 1 instead of several years into it
you type like you've been molested by your dad
So specific you should probably talk about that with your therapist instead of going online
Women will fuck anything even your incel ass just touch grass pardner
your typing style conveys that you've been molested by your dad
unless you're chad she'll be creeped out that you even suggested you're attracted to her. women take extreme offense when guys they think are ugly ask them out, because it makes them feel like those are the guys on their level
I never understood this whole 
"if you become friends with a woman just to see if she's romantically interested, you're a piece of shit"
It's like... isn't that how most relationships begin? A man and a woman become friends, and through sharing mutual interests and experiences during the friendship, thier bond evolves into a romantic relationship?
Or am I mistaken? Or is it only a "piece of shit" move for non-Chads?
being in proximity of a woman who is not hideous who i have enjoyable interactions with will make me like her romantically
crazy
You're not entitled to frienship sweetie
 Or is it only a "piece of shit" move for non-Chads?
Yep.
It's like... isn't that how most relationships begin? A man and a woman become friends, and through sharing mutual interests and experiences during the friendship, thier bond evolves into a romantic relationship? 
most people already confess before a friendship occurs because that's how mutual romance work. If she is not interested in you then it will become a friendship. 
That pic 
Kek. It isn't white women crying about not having the privilege to date low value incels but calling out how these disgusting creeps fetishize and exploit poor Asian women. Polcels are another level of delusional.
Anon, did you even read this post? She literally has every right to feel this way in this situation.
most people already confess before a friendship occurs
no they don't
 because that's how mutual romance work
no it isn't
f she is not interested in you then it will become a friendship.
no it won't.
simple as.
because I'm only 1 of the 2 and I'm 8 inches
Jesus Christ man, what the fuck do women want???
Become good friends with a woman, and suggest taking your friendship to the next level with her after bonding together?
You're a manipulative piece of shit.
Ask a woman out within minutes of meeting? Immediately skipping the platonic part of the relationship?
You're a fucking creep.
WHAT. THE. FUCK. DO. THEY. WANT!?!?
Why are you engaging with trolls
they want ugly/short men to exist as asexual utilities for "platonic" activities like helping her with her work/homework/moving/protecting her but otherwise not existing as a man with a sexuality
they want sex with tall handsome men
that's all of it. its that simple.
Uh huh because I say so
Literal child
and as for your image, they really do see muscular tall handsome men as "average" other guys are sexually invisible to them, or grotesque.
i don't know if you are trolling or not, but just don't take a lot of what they say seriously. they'll tell you what not to do and very rarely actions to take. even in those rare occasions, it's almost guaranteed to be garbage advice. they play a different role for the most part and don't date women. they are blind to what actually happens or what a guy has to do to get a date/relationship.
Cope seethe mald dilate and touch grass, sour grapser.
Nothing mentioed relates to looks.
Get your head out of the /r9k/ gutter and consider for a moment that maybe it sucks to lose a long-standing friendship because the guy decided you are not worth engaging with if you deny him pussi. 
It's basically the nice guy problem all over again where lots of men mentally blacklist women as friends if they deny them sex.
At this point just be honest and say you were interested in them as fuckmeat instead of a human being and fuck off instead of being two-faced about it.
ugly/short men are not utility machines you put basic human decency coins into and they lose their sexuality and become utility eunuchs for "platonic" slavish services
It's basically the nice guy problem all over again where lots of men mentally blacklist women as friends if they deny them sex.
I really dislike this weaponizing of nice guys. The girl's reaction to everything that happened is perfectly reasonable, and people should try to be more empathetic with her instead. Saying that, women should also be understanding of men as well who leave afterwards (within something reasonable, not fucking 20 years). It's hard to be around someone you have more interest in than just friendship and separating yourself is the easiest way to get over them next to finding someone new.
befriend girl
develop feelings for girl
ask her out
she rejects you
distance yourself because spending time with a girl you know won't reciprocate your feelings is causing you pain
REEEEEEEEE HE WAS USING ME
Women really are heartless huh?
the woman's reaction is psychopathic and unreasonable and dehumanizes/desexualizes the ugly short man she was pretending to be friends with. don't be such a cuckold pushover simp.
how dare he develop feelings for her while not being tall and handsome. yuck! ick!
You tried too hard for this not to be perceived as bait.
I'm not trolling. I've literally had this happen to me.
I've had women tell me that befriending women and asking them out later is manipulation and a piece of shit thing to do.
I've also seen women talk about how much they hate guys cold approaching them without "getting to know them" first.
Why can't women just be honest with men? Just say outright what it is you desire. 
They want average/ugly guys to be asexual worker drones for them, and only attractive men to do anything romantic with them. Normies can also be romantically involved, but only if they offer something significant in return to compensate for thier "non-Chad" status.
you can just admit you were intimidated and are bowing out of the argument because you got blown out instead of trying to save face.
lmao it really is that simple but for some reason the OP in the pic doesn't understand that
empathy really is in short supply these days huh?
If women were 100% honest with men, they would lose a lot of power in society. Could you just imagine the world if 50% (or more) of men became blackpilled?
no more simps
no more white knights
no more orbiters
no more pussy pass
like 50-70% of the male population would hate you.
If women were honest, the world would immediately become a much more hostile place for them. 
That's why women seem to lie so much about everything. It is a built in survival strategy so I don't blame them too much for it.
there is a difference between surviving and thriving though.
Your brain is soup
I agree except I don't get what you mean by "weaponising of nice guys". I used it as a catch-all simply.
Women are more valuable than len. Ugly scrotes' only worth is being our paypigs.
Difference between being a friend and someone in one's social circle
the difference is completely arbitrary.
Don't stick around someone you want to love/fuck but can't
So its wrong to want to know more someone before asking them out?
if men aren't entitled to romantic relationships then why do you feel entitled to platonic relationships?
Just cut that female bullshitting off at the start.
Stop acting nice and like fake-chaste prude with any female you find attractive from the get-go. 
If she spends more like 1-2 times during a week with you, esp with you alone? 
Start teasing a bit and clearly point out that she is a sexual being to you, lowkey implying you'd slam that until the bed breaks whenever she is available. 
If she continues to stay around or joins in on the teasing, you both now know the score.
Even if nothing happens because she has a bf atm or pulls her "not looking for one right now" excuse, the cards are on the table and she cant fake any "baww, but just friends!?" ignorance later.
If she gets her a "eww too good for u" mood or reacts badly instead, so what? She is likely nobody who you'd want as a friend anyway then.
 You are extremely dumb and naive
Point out why or fuck off back to lolcow please.
Is that the best you got when someone calls you out on your bs?

Men and women can't be friends. Why is the foid in the OP so oblivious to this
They are romantic lovers or acquaintances at best and that's all they'll ever be
There is no in-between or so called "friendship" between the sex

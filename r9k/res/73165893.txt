Girls don't wanna date me because I'm short, skinny, have a baby face, and have poor social skills. That's why I hate women
That is a good reason, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
you hate women because you're self deprecating and are fully conscious of this fact? thanks for sharing, OP
It's really only because you're short. They don't care about the rest if you're tall.

Do you know of any women who are eager to date short, skinny, baby-faced, socially inept guys?
Bruh, that's just your attitude paired with bad past experiences.
It's just that short people have an easy weakpoint to take advantage of, some prick cheated or broke up with you? Want to end the relationship but don't know how to in a healthy way?
Easy solution; call them short, small dicked, a slut/whore, ectera
Don't let it get to you, anon.

No girls like manlets though. I hate women
Are you autistic by any chance? Because if not then you still have hope if being short and baby faced are your only weaknesses and you maybe have some strength like will power, being hard working, being smart and learning constantly
but you did mention that you're socially inept so you're probably an useless autist or something so you have better things to worry about than just your appearance

I'm not autistic, but I do have problems socializing with people
Take care of yourself and go outside, they literally won't care about babyface if you look half decent and just talk to them. I recommend libraries and antique shops for some quite interesting ones, as well as a lot being 5-7/10

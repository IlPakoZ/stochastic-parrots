find it hard to talk to the sister since she got a bf, feels impure 
something freudian is going on or something
what is the psychological reason for this?
is that pic edited? no way toes are that big
Kanye loves his big piggies
Distance yourself from her. She doesn't care about your suffering. If she won't help you get a girlfriend then start slowly ghosting your sister till she's out of your life

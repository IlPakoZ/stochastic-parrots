Life without a 18-22 year old emo gf is worthless. How do you cope with being in your 30s and unable to cuddle/fuck these cuties?
no idea, I dated one for 4 years and I'm almost 23
I don't have to cope, I hate their music.
1: nobody has been emo for like 13 years
2: my first gf was one, not a big deal
I paid a 20 year old goth escort. I see her regularly. I will be 32 this year
Not the same. The validation and love isnt there.
i miss him
Holy tranny LARP
fuck off ignorant poser faggot. you never knew what emo really is
Women in general don't feel love, especially not some bpd damaged emo whore
larp is real, larp is life
Idk but making these threads every couple days clearly isn't helping you so try something else

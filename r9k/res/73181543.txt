Life without a 18-22 year old emo gf is worthless. How do you cope with being in your 30s and unable to cuddle/fuck these cuties?

no idea, I dated one for 4 years and I'm almost 23

I don't have to cope, I hate their music.

1: nobody has been emo for like 13 years
2: my first gf was one, not a big deal

I paid a 20 year old goth escort. I see her regularly. I will be 32 this year

Idk but making these threads every couple days clearly isn't helping you so try something else

Do your pubes every get so long that they hurt because they get bunched up and tugged between your thighs when you sit?
Not that long but they are still so annoying at medium length. I shave smooth so it lasts longest till I need to do it again (also feels really good first few days)
Yeah. It also gets in the way of jerking off because I have to avoid grabbing my pubes to do it.

According to the AI overlord, the clitoris pinprick is worse than full circumcision and removal of the frenulem.
This issue is irrelevant to me. Both should be illegal, and performing these evil rituals should be punishable by death
how would they know when its done to them when they are moments out of the womb in almost every case?
It never even began for males.
Many circumcised men report no reduction in sensitivity or sexual pleasure
but how would they even know? they have nothing to compare it to
They wouldn't. It's clearlu bullshit
a lot of men get circumcisions later in life
and they get to keep their frenulem. when an infant is cut it is often abalated. without a frenulem there is no pleasure.
A lot of people have them later in life due to phimosis. Not everybody is american or sabdnigger

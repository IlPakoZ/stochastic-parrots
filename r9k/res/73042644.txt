I'll be alone forever aren't I
Jebiga brate, puno srece, pa nisu bosanke uopce lose, malo cudan naglasak
You will be alone just like the rest of us one way or another
Why are muslims like this?
I want to marry this muslim girl I've been talking to for months, but her parents won't even consider me and they said they will disown her if she pushes this.
Thing is, they are really abusive and controlling, so she is considering it more and more to just run away with me.
srecam ti bajram bato
Artiljerija!
Fuck your mom then. That'a what I would do.
nemam nista protiv bosanki, i ja bi volio idealno da je bosanka (ali ne ekstremna muslimanka) ali realno i ovako sam incelash, ovo mi jos smanji sanse za 99%
I do not know about other muslim cultures, but even in islam, as far as I know, if you are a guy, you are allowed to marry a non muslim woman. You are actually also obliged to respect and make it possible for her to practice her religion, like driving her to church and the like. That is what my imam tells us, there is no compulsion to the religion 
Although it is different when it comes to muslim women being with non-muslim men ofc
For me, it is also a problem of ethnicity rather than purely religion. Mom says that even if she converted, she doesnt want me to be with her. She would rather not have grandkids than have grandkids that have non-bosniak blood in them, whatever that should mean, effectively reducing my chance to ever have a gf by about 99%, like it wasnt already horrendously low by being a submissive loser incel
hvala brate, Allah razi olsun
but then you'll never breed her anon :(

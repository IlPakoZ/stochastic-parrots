The internet has lead me to believe that most if not all women hate men and at this point I have half a mind to believe that might actually be the case.

Can you really blame women though? And do we not truly deserve the hate?

Women hate men in the abstract but they're incapable of not being in a relationship with a man for longer than a few months.

Women hate men who they are not attracted to or who are not nice to them. If you don't fall into either of those categories they are indifferent to you at best or hate you at worst.

You know if you squint at this sentiment hard enough it says all women are retarded.

Pretty much all women globally are feminists, even if they deny it and don't call themselves that.
However, most of them still expect some traditional things and dominance from a man.
They will hate you for being a dominant "patriarch", and they will also hate you for being a soft boy who believes in equality.
Basically it's a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" kind of situation.
I think if you want to have any relationships with women, you just have to accept that there will be bullshit and drama, and navigate that to the best of your ability.

You guys are out of touch, crazy out of touch. Out of all the women i know, only one (that is only bio woman but ftm without any kind of pills/operation) hate all men, and it's pretty stupid when their circle of friends is basically 90% man (me included). We don't care tho
Woman spotted
The world is beautiful because it is varied, adapt with the people you meet anon, i do, not hard. Maybe for me it's just easy to act like a normie idk

It seems like the guy who are most successful are the ones who say they believe in equality and feminism, and then simultaneously act macho and dominant around girls. That way the chick can have her cake and eat it too.

Women made me believe women hate men. They have it so damn easy literal mountains of men who would date them at the drop of a hat. Guys will rot and die alone

Because it's in vogue to shit on men, just like it's in vogue to shit on white people. It's the same as women complaining about Chad's dark triad behavior, then lining up for the same type of guy over and over again while ignoring the type of guys they loudly say they actually want. Actions speak louder than words and women lie about what they want and think all the fucking time.

women lie about what they want
That's a problem only when i have an active crush on the woman that lies, one of my old girl classmates it's still on the dick carousel and i feel she cheat a lot (talked about a sob story when she cheated and her boyfriend felt like shit) but that didn't ruin my day, like it's her life, whatever

All women lie, and the average woman lies more than the average man imho. There's even a culture among women where they humblebrag about how they manipulate men, when really most of the time it's men assuming they aren't being lied to since men do it less to each other. In other words they think they 'outwitted' the other person when really they just took advantage of a good faith actor. Being a piece of shit and being smart aren't the same thing, and being cynical because you assume other people are as shitty as you isn't 'smart' either.

All zoomer women despise men. They're more misandrist than the average incel is misogynist. Social media is full of them just casually posting the kind of shit that'd get deleted if you did it towards men. If you're not Chad you may as well be dead.

My favorite trend is their standards getting outrageously high while also saying "The bar is on the floor." 
They've completely lost touch with reality.
<comment>
Yeah, like i'm not good at writing letters to people and flowers sound pretty boring and a waste of money after a while, is that the only romantic things a woman would want? I guess if i want a girlfriend i need to find some other way to show commitment on my part. And the whole standard thing is probably a lie, the average woman wouldn't expect that much, only the ego inflated one. Anyway, being romantic sound fun too so it's not like you get a gf only for her holes, i wanna do lovey dovey stuff
<comment>
Or it's for bragging with her friends about who's boyfriend is better. But that's stupid too because you can't compare a guy that flip burgers flipper to a guy that has millions of dollars
<comment>
I would like to think you are being silly for the sake of being silly.
<comment>
Most women don't want "lovey-dovey romantic" stuff. They want abusechad to choke them out while being balls-deep in her ass, calling them a whore.

Yes.
And do we not truly deserve the hate?
we
Youre not fooling anyone cuntoid kike.
I dont give a shit how 'bad' women had it in the past, its not pay back time. You sound like a nigger.
<comment>
Yup! I hate moids and will avoid interacting with them as much as humanly possible. Their all a bunch of rape apes who live to hurt and abuse other people.
<comment>
Acting macho and dominant can easily come off as cringe and tryhard.
Your looks are your masculinity, your status is your dominance.
What I've found in personal experience is that they actually prefer you to act normal.

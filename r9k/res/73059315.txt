How do i forget some girl i was on the bus 8 months ago. I keep thinking about her for some reason and im fed up with myself. What do i do? Like holy fuck i wish i never met her
forgetting is impossible
When I was 14, the bus was extremely busy and this guy sat in the seat beside me which was super rare because people seem to avoid sitting next to me. He was decently attractive but he had such a comforting presence, I just wanted to rest my head on his shoulder more than anything but obviously I did not because that would have been extremely weird. I still wish I could have, I think about him all the time.

You will never forget her. I still remember girls in my life this briefly 3 decades later anon. Just appreciate the time you had with her in your retarded life
Girls can usually get away with doing this kind of shit. Should have gone for it anon
Maybe cute girls could but I think he would have been freaked out if it were me. Idk when I was in high school and took the bus home, most guys would stand in the aisle rather than sit next to me so I'll settle with being happy he didn't mind that
i think it is more likely that men avoided sitting next to you because you were an underage girl. the risks of performing such an action is one that most men are well aware of.

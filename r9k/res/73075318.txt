I'm lonely. I wish I had a gf to sleep with, so we could warm each other up in the midst of this cold night.
I just wanna play project zomboid with someone
What is that? Is it free?
Have you tried getting a gf to resolve this issue
he will never get a gf, he's mine
Attempts to obtain a gf have been unsatisfactory. Lady Luck has withheld her blessings recently. As such, I will have to expend more effort in order to find a gf.
From when did I become yours to behold?
in reality op just wants to troon out.
Since ive been seeing you around in other threads, fag.
I do not have such intentions anymore, and I do not expect to have any such intentions in the future.
A rather keen eye you've been keeping on me, haven't you, anon?
Perhaps it is not an issue of inadequate effort expension, but rather technique? Working hard without also working smart can be just a needless drain of energy
I would be ur gf but this is a red flag..The fact u thought about it means u r at high risk still and I dont wanna take the chance, sorry anon.
Im not a crazy stalker.. I hope one day you make a thread about your girlfriend that you got which will never happen also ywnbaw
yeah, because your UGLY or short or mentally ill or whatever, you annoying avatar attention fag

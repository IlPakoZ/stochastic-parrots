I'm lonely. I wish I had a gf to sleep with, so we could warm each other up in the midst of this cold night.

I just wanna play project zomboid with someone
<comment>
What is that? Is it free?

Have you tried getting a gf to resolve this issue
<comment>
he will never get a gf, he's mine

Attempts to obtain a gf have been unsatisfactory. Lady Luck has withheld her blessings recently. As such, I will have to expend more effort in order to find a gf.

From when did I become yours to behold?
<comment>

<comment>
Since ive been seeing you around in other threads, fag.

I do not have such intentions anymore, and I do not expect to have any such intentions in the future.
A rather keen eye you've been keeping on me, haven't you, anon?

Perhaps it is not an issue of inadequate effort expension, but rather technique? Working hard without also working smart can be just a needless drain of energy

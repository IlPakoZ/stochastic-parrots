My life feels fairly meaningless, so we can be sad together.

Go ahead and don't make a mess. People will still need to clean it after. Actually, you could it clean first, before you do anything. Some nice work cleans the mind and you wouldn't want to ruin the job you've just done.

The past few weeks have felt inexplicably sad. I have (clinical depression) and have had the same diagnosis for over 15 years, and the past few weeks have had this weird sense of somberness and loss combined with the mild irritation present beforehand. Everything has felt changed the past few weeks and I don't know exactly why.

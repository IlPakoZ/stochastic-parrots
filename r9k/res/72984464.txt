The uglier women are most insecure. Generally: The more flaws = The more insecurities.

ugly women are more insecure, but they're also retarded. tends to be that they feel inferior bodily, but they feel like a goddess facially (even though their looksmatch is rotting on incel websites) thanks to the quality of men that want them.

Women aren't insecure in 2023. It's just neurosis and narcissism.

women being insecure is a meme 
if anything they are overdosing on vanity 
and overinflated sense of self-worth 
hoe can you be insecure when your entire life everyone is pandering to you and agreeing to whatever bullshit you come up with, not a single action you do can result in negative consequences, neither legal nor social. 
everything they do is stuck in permanent positive feedback loop
women are insecure.

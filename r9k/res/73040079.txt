You don't love her, just the idea of loving her
All lonely boys should internalize this phrase when they're going after girls. It will protect you from heartbreak.
its impossible to love someone because its impossible to know someone. everyone falls in love with ideas and internal representations because that's the only way we are able to interact with the world. the only determining factor is how far the idea of the person in your head is from the real life person.
You can tell yourself that but it's one of those things you have to learn the hard way.

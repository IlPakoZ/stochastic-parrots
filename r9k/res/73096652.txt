Unironically just read books and go down Wikipedia rabbit holes.

I dont have attention span for that and when I say smart i mean problem solving skills not remembering gay useless facts about how Japan banned samurai swords during Meiji era . 
In essence how do I get better processing power
<comment>
Stop poisoning yourself and eat animal products with minimal additives and minimal processing. Large amounts of butter, eggs, and meat

Start off by looking at what textbooks college courses use and download them off libgen and start doing all the problems in them. MIT coursware and other similar sites help.
It helps if you are interested in the topic, but most college students are just motivated the threat of dropping out 
looming over them, so you are at a motivational disadvantage here and you will have to try a lot harder.
Also take omega fatty acids and a multivitamin a day. Liek another anon said here, It might help if you have a good diet in general. Maybe do a bit of cardio.

And by college textbooks, I mean calculus, differential equations, chemistry, this sort of stuff. General skills that are useful in engineering and science, not sperg dinosaur/train factbooks.
I only have one "deep" skill at the moment, which is computer programming. The only way I got there was through *thousands* of hours of experience, grinding, going out of my way to find and read shit to work on (esp. open source software), and deep information mining through the internet and books.
Stop playing video games. There is literally no time in adult life to do that. Delete your steam account or whatever else. Your only fulfillment should come though constructive activity, not burning your remaining time in a giant bonfire that is video games, movies, TV.

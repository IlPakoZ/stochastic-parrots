dated a coworker for a while, after breaking up, everyone knows about my private life, all of our relationship arguments, and every little fuck up that i did is now known with all my co-workers
i tried to be mature and be at friendly to her but that didn't work, now i hear gossip from people about her going on tinder dates and straight up i just want to kill myself. my feelings for this person have long since evaporated but i feel like i'm being baited into giving a reaction but im not gonna budge, i wasted half a year of my life for this to happen in the end
on the bright side, she could've falsely accused you of sexual harassment
don't give up anon
I know this sounds cliche, but try to take the high road. Anyone with half a brain can realize that she's being immature and petty. If someone airs someone's shit to mutual acquaintances after the end of relationship, that just makes them look worse. When you're in a relationship, you are both going to learn embarrasing, unsavory aspects of each other's character. But you're choosing not to share that, while she, in her pain, does. In the long run, you look better. Despite all thse supposed flaws, she still chose to date you.
Might want to start job hunting to avoid the bullshit if it's getting to you that much, though.

This is why you never date co-workers.

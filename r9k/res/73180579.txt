Does life get harder as you get older? Not just physically speaking but in general with everything else too.

It mostly just gets harder and more stressful. At least that's how it's been for me. Worth mentioning that I am sacrificing most of my 20s upon the altars of capitalism and education so that I can be comfy later in life. One day I'll have a 6 figure salary and a minimized amount of responsibilities. Then I'll finally be free.

Eh, I don't know. I had terrible anxiety as a kid and being anywhere but home was terrible. I'd say I'm having a much easier time now than when I was younger, but in taking it easy. I don't have kids or any bullshit like that, hell I don't even worry about rent. Just get to pocket my whole paycheck.

It only gets harder if you don't have people you can trust to mitigate shit parts of life. 
I have brothers, live in a large house, we split the cost of everything, life is EZ mode(we all collectively pull in 300k).
Some people live with their parents saving money, life is EZ mode.
I'm convinced we live in a world where you cannot get by alone anymore.

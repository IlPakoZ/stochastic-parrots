I hate pet ownership, and specifically dogs.
I just fucking hate them. Yappy, slobbering, disgusting, diseased, dependent, barking shitting unpredicatable fucking NIGGERS.
I just hate them so fucking much. And wider pet ownership in general. It's a disgusting immoral practice. You take an animal that belongs in the wild, in a pack, and you subdue it, domesticate it, make it fucking dependent upon you. You cut it's balls off, chain it by the neck, train it to submit to you, deny it's natural instincts, and force it to live among another species as a perpetual plaything, a substitute child or a tool for humans to use. It's sickening. 
And yes I know it's not their fault, but my hatred for domesticated dogs goes beyond my hatred for domestication and pet ownership itself. If it were up to me I'd genocide every last fucking one of them. Evil vile creatures that belong in the depths of fucking hell. 
KILL THEM ALL.

Dogs are an infantilized, pathetic species so devolved into these begging, desperate creatures that can die if you leave them to their own devices. To even be able to watch an animal behave this way should make you sad.
Pets are a cop-out from dealing with actual humans for emotional connection. It's actually a very slave-ownery mentality, you went and picked up this helpless animal and now not only do you feel like a hero but the living thing is forced into a relationship with you that they don't really have a say in because you're not equal species. A human being can decide, "I'm not interested in being friends with you" but a dog has to consider their survival, especially since they've been rendered unable to take care of themselves. It's similar to people who rely on sex workers for all their intimacy and convince themselves it's a real, equal exchange when really, the sex worker needs money.
People walk their dogs and it gives them something to bond with other people over and something to talk about. This saves them from having to deal with the pain of awkward conversations and maybe not being interesting enough to some people. You'll be sitting in a room with a bunch of people, there's a dog in the house, everyone is relieved because the dog provides them with hours of conversation and entertainment that they otherwise would've needed to fill with something else.
I'm sick of having to lie to people all day because I don't hate dogs but I think it's cruel and pathetic to keep pets.
Not to mention disgusting. Having a dog or cat gives you a mental illness that makes you think a butthole that just took a shit rubbing up on the pillow you sleep on is okay and a little ball of allergies shedding all over your house is okay and having a box of piss and shit in sand sitting somewhere in your house is ok.

You are just jealous because they get called good boys and you dont

Haha I am a benevolent god in my dogs life. I provide it a worry free existence. Free from predators. Free from starvation. Medical care if they get sick. No struggle. Only happy times because I'm a superior being. 
Would you treat your nigger slaves the same?
<comment>
Based and anti-dog pilled. Having a violent guard dog makes sense but anything else is peak retard.
<comment>
your dog is a crippled wild animal that has been medically altered and trained to rely on you for it's survival.
you provide for it's food needs while at the same time remove all expressions of natural behaviour - living in a pack, finding its own food, mating, having it's own progeny, living in it's natural habitat. in doing so you remove it's opportunity for a dignified life, selfishly turning it into a living plaything for your own need to feel control superiority and domination.
you are the blackest nigger on this board. a disgusting black coalfaced nigger bitch. I hope you suffer in nigger hell.

yeah, ive made this point before. this is why i find dogs so repulsive. they are these weird genetic abominations that are exploited to be our slaves
they are subjected to slavery, eugeneics, castration, and abuse, all the time. and we only allow the most loving ones to breed, which is super cynical and cruel
if we did this with females there would be an outrage, but for animals its okay?
honestly, dogs are creepy, and are for normies who have a god-like complex who need to be worshiped
also, you better be vegan otherwise you are a massive hypocrite

hatred for domesticated dogs
You know that in caveman times, early humans really counted on dogs companionship. Dogs were an advantage to our survival/development, we just happen to be born in times after mass domestication.
While i agree with all your points on dog ownership. If its not a "working" dog then you shouldn't able allowed to own them in the urban city. Other then that, we all live in this society together so just deal with it stupid nigger.
<comment>
by that logic nobody should have children either as they are basically "pets" for their parents
<comment>
Yeah we've got a lot of history with dogs, it's a symbiotic relationship
<comment>
You cut it's balls off
no, i kept him intact cause im not a jew.
<comment>
okay so aside from your autistic posturing, what do we do with the thousands of dogs without homes? kill them? eat them? let them starve? what exactly is your point.
<comment>
For me it's a pet turtle.
<comment>
you're blinded by pet ideology to think that dogs belong in "homes". Dogs should live in a pack among their own kind. pet ownership as a social/cultural institution needs to end. the first thing we need to do is acknowledge that its even a problem in the first place.
practically we could pass laws like:
pet breeders could face fines and jail time
pet stores are illegal
all pets must be spayed under threat of heavy fines
any excess unwanted pets to be killed (immoral, but a price to pay)
the pet "industry" to be regulated out of existence (eg, make it impossible to run kennels, "daycares", heavily tax pet foods, vets, basically make it financially and legally difficult to own pets
realistically none of this will ever happen. people just "love" their slaves too much. at the very least though we should acknowledge that it is wrong/a problem.
<comment>
not op, but putting them all down would be a good thing. i don't even care about other pets, unless they're exotic dangerous animals
<comment>
Bros, I want a cat or a dog so bad but I don't have my own home, am irresponsible, etc.. So unfair that homeless people are allowed to have pets but not me.
<comment>
onestly, dogs are creepy, and are for normies who have a god-like complex who need to be worshiped
exactly. my brother has a dog and it is clear their relationship is one of domination control and submission. he "owns" that animal, controls it, feels superior to it, dominates it, and calls it "love". pure narcissism. I hope it fucking dies.

Look you stupid moron, unfortunately you're born 150,000 years too late. There is nothing that can be done about it. Its too ingrained into all of our genetics and society since the dawn of man. 
Go make a political party then, ill vote for you cause yeah fuck animals bro lol. But expect to be crushed in the polls for eternity. How! about just don't acquire any fucking animals then?. Why so butt hurt about others enjoying theirs? let it go. 
Wanna know a fact kek? your ancestral parents where dog breeders and dog lovers. So the only thing left to do now is to kys retard.

Cute golden retriever. I love em, I've had a golden all my life. Sadly after moving out for uni haven't been able to own a pet, but visiting my parents is even nicer now
<comment>
Based beyond the beef. All pets and pet owners should be slaughtered and distributed amongst their neighbors as food

i know its weird, but i think its wrong to do that to innocent animals like dogs or cats
but at the same time thats my ideal relationship with a girl, that i dream about constantly
and whats also weird is that most normies would never treat a girl like that, but treat animals like that?
??????
yeah, okay god, whatever you say

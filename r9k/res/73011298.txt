I (24M) have a friend (23F) who does cosplays of anime characters
ask her if I could see her wearing it
she says only if l cosplay a character that she picks
I said okay
she sent me pic reI and said she has the wig
I haven't responded since
What did she mean by this?

you're the "gay friend"

She wants a sense of power over you by emasculating yourself for her pleasure. And also an excuse to laugh at any issues with your body and skin.

She sees you as nonthreatening so she's open to sending you lewd things. You dumb cuck.

Does she also have a yellow bowl?
Say yes, but never show your dick, cover it with the yellow bowl if you turn your front. Make her fight to see it. When she asks, say how it is all unfair you should expose yourself while shes dressed.

Should I let her see my butt like in the pic?

She has the yellow bowl

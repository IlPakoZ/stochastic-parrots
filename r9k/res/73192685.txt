women exploit mentally ill men by giving them the slightest bit of attention in exchange for money and devotion
no one wants to admit it but "friendzoning" is female cruelty. no healthy-minded male wants to spend all of his time, energy and money on someone who sees them as a friend at best. women know this yet continue to exploit them because being wanted by chads isn't enough.

and same goes for the paypig aspect. the people who are paypigs for girls aren't doing it for the fetish (although that is a component of it). they're doing it because again, they're mentally ill and are extremely desperate for any kind of female interaction. women should be ashamed of themselves.

the problem lies with the simp being a pushover. Be friends with girls but make them respect your boundaries like any friendship. autist

why doesnt he acknowledge that he's making things worse for other men?

If you don't like it so much you could always become a simp yourself

there are no better wingmen than female friends. Having female friends is such a facilitator for sex when going out that I much rather go out clubbing with girls than with my boys.

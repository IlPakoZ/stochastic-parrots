How do I cope with having literally 0 friends? Yes that includes online as well.

You can start by wrapping your lips around my cock and sucking me off to ejaculation, big boy

Yawn. Counting posts until you admit you're one of those "friendless" guys with a 10 year old friend circle that mysteriously doesn't count because "I don't see them often".
It's always the same with you people.

no, i will forever remember this moment, no matter how much time passes, OP will always have a friend, somewhere out there

I'm OP's friend too. I don't let just anyone suck my cock

Spend some time trying to make online friends on /soc/ or something, realize how fucking dull/obnoxious most people are and conclude being alone is probably the best option rather than repeatedly rolling the dice on finding someone you actually gel with who also happens to like you.

normies tell me I am wasting my life
31
zero attraction to women or men zero desire to masturbate or watch porn
works at walmart as a cashier does the bare basics to get by
lives alone in a studio apartment
is happy
normie family members want me to get a significant other or friends
I have zero desire for friends or a significant other
doesnt use social media of any type
family wants me to volenter to try mingling but fuck that why the hell would I work for free
completely nerotypical and normie, just has a weird mindset
family thought I would outgrow it
I feel fantastic
fuck normies
my entire family thinks I am wasting my life but I could not be happier just reading books all day and gaming. I hardly even use 4chan no desire to connect.
humans dont even talk about anything interesting, it is boring as fuck.

also, op here again can we jfl at the thought of a 31 year old even having friends it feels incredibly childish and stupid lol
<comment>
4chan is social media, retard. you are living a lie to yourself. simple as.
<comment>
I literally post here maybe once a year to rant I just wish how I want to live would be socially acceptable. probably going to disown the family
<comment>
also op here I probably make maybe 4k a month but it's plenty for me because I do not buy much of anything I eat one meal a day and rent is cheap since this place is in the ghetto.

if you truly felt content with your lifestyle you wouldn't care what other people thought of it. Matter of fact is that it bothers you, but who cares? You're happy with your life so that's all that matters, learn how to not give a shit fully, you're like 95% of the way already. Personally I think your life sounds painfully boring, but should you care about my (or anyone else's) opinion? Nah nigga.

yeah I got to learn how to not give fucks agreed I have always been sensitive to criticism. I will work on this at some point. its possible I need less simulation to be happy it seems that way at least
<comment>
being sensitive to criticism is a curse nigga, work on it. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere if I let people's criticism sway my decisions or control my emotions.
<comment>
your right about that shit for sure. hopefully I can snap the fuck out of it.

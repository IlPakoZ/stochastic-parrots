Just read "The Compulsive Gambler" and here's my analysis
The author wants a group of hot lesbians to bankrupt him in a single rigged gamble, and then keep him as a pet where he obeys each and every of their commands for the rest of his life
I liked the anime. Remember when the author made the whole of isekai tards seethe and got cancelled because Japs are such bootlickers about "Donto insuruto the honnoru of muh senpai!"
I've spent 5 years studying psychological analysis doctrines and I think you're spot-on
Wtf that author is literally me

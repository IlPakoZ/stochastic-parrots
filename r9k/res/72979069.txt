inb4 "muh depression muh anhedonia" 
the truth is that most zoombots dont even have the attention span to play a video game. just having to learn the mechanics makes them mentally exhausted, and then if they experience a setback like not understanding something at first glance, or dying a couple times, they just quit, and watch someone else play the game on pootube.
that's really the root of it, zoomers grew up watching streamers instead of trying to play games as a little kid despite being terrible, but thats how you learn to play things, and more importantly, how you learn to persist despite difficulties.

I'm tired of replaying the games that I like, and It takes way too much effort to find a good game to play that I've never played before

This, except I'm not a zoomer and I used to enjoy games. I was able to keep trying for months until I got a 100% in everything. Also, I don't really like vidya streams.

I got tired of it. I had a little episode last fall and destroyed all my vidya. I regret it though. Wish I could play some animal crossing city folk :(

Because I feel like shit. Yes I enjoy when I do cool things in video games or overcome bosses but the thought that I am wasting my life doing this never escapes mind. There is no enrichment when I do that. It's not like socialisation which strengthens bonds or even a good movie or book that may make you think. I will never be good enough at video games to earn actual money or clout.I am just an adult playing with toys. And no matter how immersed I get even to the point I forget these thoughts it will all end up with black screen with my reflection on it.

fuck this is me,i wish i had a pc good enough to run games as a child so id have developed a taste for them by now

even a good movie or book that may make you think
why do boomers keep pushing this. if you like reading or tv or vidya and not anything else that's fine but I'm not going to pretend that books and film are some kind of intellectually superior medium of entertainment.

most indie games can run smoothly on toasters

You are missing on a lot by not picking up philosophical books. I used to believe they were a meme to untill I got into it. Films are mix bag but they themselves are a reflection of philosophies if made by talented people.

I just don't enjoy it any more. I load up a game, play 5 minutes and realise I'd rather just do nothing instead. I think I got burned out playing League of Legends for so many years. I had a lot of fun with it, but also a lot of genuine misery. When I was done with it, I struggled to gain any enjoyment from anything else.

He was done with League because he was a cunt in it, though, and got banned multiple times. I got annoyed or upset but I was never a dickhead and never over thousands of games got banned.

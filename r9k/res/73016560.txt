Seriously ladies, how much could a man make you do?
<comment>

you could name it and id probably do it

Have you learned Korean to try to win his heart?
<comment>
i remain latently weirded out by why on earth you would want someone to hurt you during sex but yoloooo apparently everyone else likes this so ok
<comment>
yea but i am just enjoying the fantasy and parasocial relationship because there is a 99.9999999% chance it will never happen anyway 
its not realistic but i daydream about it a lot 
if you put me in a surreal scenario where it was actually a possibility to perform tasks in order to win his heart, i would do pretty much all of them no matter how fucked up, just for a chance for him to fall in love with me
or even just to hop on his dick

If you ever look up "courtly love" it was the parasocial relationship of the medieval times. A knight would swear his love to some highborn lady that he may never meet and dedicate his deeds of bravery and derring-do to her.
That's cool that you're learning a language though.

It is a little odd, but I roll with it.
<comment>
thats honestly very interesting 
so i guess it would be sexes reversed and i would be taking the role of showing devotion and simping basically, yeah 
cool 
i think thats what fans basically are

go to korea to stalk him and record him
<comment>
I'm sure a nice Korean boy would appreciate you, or at least use you.
I think femsimps are neat.
<comment>
it hurts my feelings a little bit (actually kind of a lot but whateeever i've internalized suppreessing how much i don't liiiike it)
<comment>
if one day i have nothing left to lose, i might turn into a full blown stalker, just for the hell of it. i heard some fans crowdfunded and bought an apartment facing a korean singers condo, just so they could look at him through his windows and see him on his balcony lul
<comment>
yea i am a femsimp, cant deny it ;_;
i wish i had a close friend i could stalk people with

female falls in love with chad
one day once she's an old hag she realizes she will never get with him
settles with some sad beta cuckold sap and has to hide the fact that she resentful of him
many, MANY such cases
<comment>
I had my oneitis' baby, to give to him and no involvement mysself to raise, because his gf-eventually-wife didn't want to have a kid herself
<comment>
e-hug for you e-creep
Since I'm not Korean I can't expect to use you. But you sound like a fun, if legally dubious, friend.
<comment>
It's like both women kind of cucked each other.
<comment>
o thank you &lt;3 hug back 
does anyone really end up with their first choice tho? i think most people end up settling unfortunately &lt;/3
<comment>

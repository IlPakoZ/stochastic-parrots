finally get a gf
cute face, nice body, finally have sex 
doesn't feel as fulfilled as I thought. Enjoy my time off when she leaves
why?
<comment>
Teenage hype that never ended.
<comment>
Because it isn't what /r9k/ made you think it was like. I try to tell people that but they just say I'm coping.
<comment>
It is because of the girl that I feel this way? Would I feel different if it's a different girl?
I've never been physically intimate with anyone else before
<comment>
Because people over hype it.
<comment>
You built up what you thought being with someone was like and it isn't up to that expectation. It's your fault. Not the woman's.
<comment>
wet hole.....overhyped?
<comment>
maybe because the girl isn't someone you want to be spending time with. your goal is to find a girl that you love because they're literally your best friend and have similar interests and life goals. so many guys date attractive girls because thats all they care about, and then say "oh, girls are just crazy" when their girlfriend or wife is argumentative and batshit insane. better girls out there exist, and most people who are very attractive get by in life by their looks, usually making them a shitty person to be around with a meh or worse personality.

Finally get gf
Face looks like an orangutans, fat, finally have sex, finally cuddle with a girl
Feel amazing, feel on top of the world
I miss that bitch so god damned much. Not sure what you're problem is, OP.

Why would a wet, slippery vagina designed to stretch to push out a newborn be as tight as a clench fist could be? How could a man be able to simulate a vibrator that pulses dozens of times per second?
People like sex because of control, compassion, and comfort. Not because of sheer pleasure, the reality is if you're really trying, you can create pleasure for yourself through toys or other stimulation beyond just physical sex. Sex is for completely different experiences, things porn, toys or hookers cannot give you.

What happened?
<comment>
I don't know. I was hoping I'd feel more alive and want to live life once I find a gf... but the opposite is true. She makes me feel like life is pointless and there's no hope.
I think it may be because she's going through a lot right now.
<comment>
Would I feel different if it's a different girl?
yes, you need excitement and chaos
find a girl with bpd who will completely lovebomb you every second of the day and will always rely on you and do whatever you want
<comment>
You're too used to being alone and you actually enjoy it.
I fear I would be the same, if I ever escape inceldom (kek).
I have no interest in dating. I just want to fuck. A lot.

FUCK. I was thinking that last night. I get so tired when she stay over. I can't rest, I can't feel like I'm fully relaxed. I feel like I have to constantly find something for us to do (which to her credit said I don't have to). I feel boring and not interesting around her.
<comment>
It's not all that, it gets annoying actually
<comment>
Yes. That's precisely how I'd feel too.
Though you seem to be very lucky that she seems cool enough to just want to chill (for now).
One of the big things that puts me off relationships is that constant expectation to 'do something'.

If anything it makes me feel like I have to become more intersting to lead a normie life now.

then it just means its not a good match you retard
trust me, from experience, with the right girl the activities and fun simply appear on their own, and you can be comfortable sitting in autistic silence doing nothing as well

become more intersting
Oh, HELL no...

She's comfortably, but I feel useless and boring around her. I don't just want to sit around watch TV on the sofa all day and sleep till 930 in the morning every day. I want to feel exicted to live with a girl, not feel more tired and nihilistic
Why
<comment>
Why
As I said; I enjoy being a hermit and am used to my own company.
Relationships are hard work by comparison. I guess the Black Pill really did deliver me into Monk Mode.
I guess some suggestions for you would be going for a walk in the park with her, getting breakfast and/or a coffee and talking.
Sadly, I can barely afford to do those things on my own and there's still the expectation for the man to always pay. I'm too irretrievably NEETcel for that.

I'm literally paying for everything right now. I'm much better off than she is (she's basically living out of her car, not her choice, just work and family issues).

I already do that, there's only so much you can talk about

as i said, with the right girl you'll feel right.
this isn't a match obviously. you gonna spend the rest of your life like this? only what, 50 more years to go? maybe 60

I want to do shrooms, but I can't find a dealer. I don't want to order online fug
People grow their own shrooms too. You can look it up on youtube. If you're fine with handling horse shit in a tub then buying the spores to grow the mushrooms and everything else isn't really that complicated. Otherwise just do what normies do to get their shrooms: Go to a farm and pick them off cow patties.
Go to a farm and pick them off cow patties.
Kek. I actually have a syringe of spores. I've just been too lazy to get the rest of the materials. Maybe I can grow it in a covered jar instead of a shoebox.
You probably could, yeah. Just make sure you keep things pretty clean and sterile. 70% isopropyl alcohol is also better than 91% that you might buy at the store, too little water means the alcohol can't interact well enough with any microbes. A jar would probably be better too for getting what one person might want, whereas a tub is probably gonna give you way too much.

I've grown culinary mushrooms before, not psilocybin though. The substrate for culinary mushrooms is a lot more pleasant too. Sawdust works pretty well. One rule was that you expect something like 1/10th the weight of your substrate in mushrooms for the first flush(assuming your substrate is pretty good), so a big plastic tub with 5 pounds of shit will yield maybe half a pound of psilocybin if I had to guess -- which is a lot.

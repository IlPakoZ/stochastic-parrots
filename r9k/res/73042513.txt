For ten years I almost daily fantasize that I'm in a room full of people explaining something I know a lot about.
Even after leaving highschool where I barely had any opportunity to do this.
Even almost finishing college, where I never had any opportunity to do this.
How do I stop this?

Start a youtube channel, become kind of famous, start doing lectures/public speeches.
Boom now you are living your dream

I'm not OP, but have the same problem. I have no interest starting a Youtube channel. I just want the fucking thoughts to stop and do stuff instead, but whenever I try working on things, I just get sucked back into my thoughts.

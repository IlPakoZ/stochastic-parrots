Do "dom" women actually exist or do they all secretly want to be beaten and dominated by a "chad"? Almost every "dom" bitch I've ever met was a poser at the end of the day. Women should want a man who's submissive and willing to let her dominate every single aspect of his life. Ya got a problem with that ya fucking toxic male?

Do "dom" women actually exist who don't have tattoos, don't care about currents trends and trying to fit in and please society, and aren't interested in your typical lying con artist chad who beats them up, parties with the guys, constantly cheats on them? A woman who doesn't let her boyfriend have an ounce of privacy and bosses him around every minute of the day. A woman who doesn't have any "girlfriends", "guy friends", or "girls night out". God. Where are they?

Think about it, they are so rare and in demand that it's literally a legal profession to be a dominatrix in places where prostitution is normally illegal.
It's like finding a woman who can grow a decent beard.
Yeah they exist but it really rare, most who are able choose not to for social and self esteem reasons, some can sort of do it but the end result is crappy, and a few are willing to fake it for a paycheck.
Regardless you are hunting for a rare freek indeed.

They exist, but usually dom women aren't that similar to dom men. Women usually like being dominant by having mental control. They like seeing a guy squirm when they hint they might be unhappy etc. It's usually less abotu physical domination and more about mental control. Obv that's a generalization but I find it to be overall true

Yes but they don't dom because it's sexy, they are just BPD or psychotic. And they don't follow trends or have friends because no one still put up with them, and they probably won't put up with you either, unless they "choose" you as their mark

So... do they just not exist?
I've had this sexual fantasy of being dominated by women ever since I was a teen. And you're telling me I won't ever have a girl do it for me of her own free will?

My gf used to be a lifter in high school, built like a tank. Not particularly emotional ( especially for a woman ), doesn't like to talk about feelings a ton because it makes her feel weak, bad at emotional expression, etc. Doesn't talk much, easy going.
Lets me curl up to her on the couch even though I'm taller, views me as a kid in a lot of ways ( especially sexually apparently ).
Luck.

"Dom" women are mentally ill, for the vast majority of human history, it was wildly deviant and dangerous for a woman to be attracted to a man weaker than her. For this reason, the vast majority of women and basically all healthy women seek out strong men.

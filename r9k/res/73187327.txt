...plump?
Pic related is the body of the average stacy in 2023. You rarely ever see skinny girls being popular in high school and college anymore.

Maybe you just live in a fat area. I live by a university and literally all of the girls in the local sororities are just variations on the same cookie-cutter skinny white bitch. All of them thin as rakes; no tits, no ass.

If fats looked like that, I'd actually give them the time of day.

As a 6'3 guy with a 7.5x6 Uncut cocktail I find the Venus body type extremely arousing.

The ideal pairing is
Guy:
height over 6'0
penis over 7"
BMI under 18
Girl:
height under 5'0
breasts over H cup, ass over 45"
BMI over 28

The average Stacy is projected to weigh 1200 lbs by 2035 due to the advancements in medical care, with the GigaStacies over 2000 lbs. Once health isn't an issue with extreme obesity, men will begin preferring extremely heavier women and women will start bulking up.

Beer and fast food.

Not in northern areas with high concentration of whites. My son graduated recently and there were plenty of skinny girls. They weren't knees and elbows like the 70s/80s (when girls were graduating at sub 100lbs body weight and couldn't donate blood to Red Cross as seniors) but I wouldn't call them fat at all. Still plenty of ED anorexics and shit at his school too

being fat is totally normalized more people are at least overweight than aren't

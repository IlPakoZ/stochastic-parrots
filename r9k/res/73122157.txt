Is it true that for most people, they divide people into categories of "emotionally close friends" and "friends they like to spend time with" and everyone else? And is it true that you only care deeply about your "emotionally close friends?" 
My (irl) male friend and I spent almost every waking hour together on discord call. I cared about him a lot and would express it in favors I did for him, like deliver food. Even though he didn't emotionally open up to me, I thought that since he spent so much time with me, that he loved me in his own way.
My guy friend said I was stupid for ever thinking that. Why would he care deeply about someone he never emotionally opened up to? Time means nothing. All it ever meant was he enjoyed my company. Sure, he cared a little about me, but not enough to cook for me if I was starving, or listen to my problems, or care how his death would affect me if he committed suicide. 
Is this normal? I just don't understand. If you're willing to spend so much time with someone, wouldn't that mean you love them? Is this really the norm like my friend insists it is?

Yes

Meant to say my friend and I spent almost every waking hour together for a year. Often, the day would start with us waking up and calling each other and the call would end when we go to sleep. We would joke around and play games or just do our own activities in silence. I would nap over call. Sometimes he would stay at my place for long periods of time. Given all this, isn't it normal to expect that he loves me, at least platonically?
For context I am a depressed fembot. I was one of his two friends. My friend is also depressed and mentally ill.
<comment>
For some people, do you put them in the "friend you only like to spend time with" based on vibes, and then that is it? No matter what happens after you wont ever care deeply about them?
<comment>
I don't really get this divide of classifying, dividing, organizing, and sectioning people off like they're things. I treat and think of my friends as just that: my friends. I couldn't care any less about what the friends of my friends say or talk shut about each other, as long as I deem them an alright person I leave them to their own lives. I've had many friends talk to me about gossip, "fake friendships" and manipulative relations but Bah, humbug! I could care less about that cause I care more for them. HELL, I even had a friend who thought he was ayanokouji from classroom of the elite just because he had friend circles he changed personalities in and thought he was "manipulating" me when all he ever did was just talk to me. I don't care if you think you're manipulating me or our friendship is fake, we are friends and that's that. I cried in their presence, confessed so many sins and fetishes and secrets and so on but did it ever cut us off? No, cause we're all people, we're all living our own lives so to hell with stupid shut likes drama and gossip bullshit.

It's just a platonic friendship. Asking what he thinks won't hurt.if it does, then that's that. If he makes it awkward, just make it seem normal even after that. It's still normal. Don't get so down, it's not like the world will end just because you two don't talk now like you used to, you still know each other and deep down you can talk because you know about each other, for better or for worse. Now go out there and bruteforce your feelings into confidence and straighten your back, you've got things to say.
<comment>
Yes. There are some people I just wouldn't want to get close to, even if I enjoy spending time with them. Though I personally wouldn't call them friends.
<comment>
Ask him what he thinks about what? We didn't fight or anything. He just told me that since he never opened up to me he never really cared about me, even though we were very good friends. 
I am trying to understand how common his perspective is.
<comment>
Thanks for your feedback, anon. For those people you only enjoy spending time with, would you be willing to spend significant time with them daily? Could you have a "best friend" who you know you would never open up to?
<comment>
That's what happens when you assume proximity equals affection. Also just because you are fun or a good way to pass the time doesn't mean they are attached to you
It's such an uncomfortable feeling when you are the friend that cares less by the way. I feel like it just turns me off to the other person even more because I view them as needy or desperate or something. I also get annoyed at them if they try to hold me accountable for small slights that to me were fucking nothing
<comment>
I guess my friend was right then. His perspective is common. I never even considered that it would be possible to not truly care about your friends. For me, friends are people you love and care for.
I think I need to face reality and just accept I am alone.
<comment>
You sound like an annoying little kid I'm surprised he even put up with you that long. I'm not even a guy and I'm saying this. Pollyanna.
<comment>
I don't view people I pass time with as my friends. To me if we don't have any emotional connection and we're just hanging out we aren't even friends. I'm autistic as shit though and only have some online friends.
<comment>
For those people you only enjoy spending time with, would you be willing to spend significant time with them daily?
A few of my schoolmates fell into that category. I suppose the difference between them and my best friend was, I was always "doing something" with my schoolmates, like playing vidya or skateboarding, whereas I often spent time with my best friend doing nothing in particular. We would just walk around the neighborhood or sit at home doing our own separate things, but together.
Could you have a "best friend" who you know you would never open up to?
No. With the exception of, let's say I had a secret I was afraid to tell anybody, not just him, I'd still consider him my best friend even if I couldn't tell him.
<comment>
I have a few really good friends. I have only admitted something emotional to one of them and I regret it. it's just not for everybody. If your friend is depressed he likely isn't able to clearly assess his own relationship with you. If you died or taken by black apes to be raped forever I'd bet he'd miss you a lot more than he would let on.
<comment>
Fuck off. I'm just finding out now that the people in my life right now is literally zero and that I may have misinterpreted my past friendships. This is a board for socially retarded hermits. Excuse me for not catching on sooner.

Yes, people, autist do it all the time. Its not all about emotional connection, there are some bonus factor like shared expiriences, but lions share of human frendships, even those that seem to be deep, are superficial. Maybe 1/20 of them are your "real friend". For example i have like 2-3 "real friends" which are basicly a leftover of what lefts of my younger years. We care for eachother, got our back, but we talk/see each other once a month. At this point theres almost nothing we have in common, but still we remember about it other. When it comes to normal friends, you may think that your relationship is amazing, but at some point it becomes aparent that your friendship is somewhat one sided. I had friends which i regarded as borderline close one ghost me or just stopped hanging out because of stupid resons and i myself did something similar when i felt that some "normal" friend got to needy. Its always very shitty feeling when you discover that you are more involved in a fleeting relationship.
If you really care for the guy, talk with him, but if you really support him with food ect, it looks like hes just there because you provide some services for him. Its not a real frendship. If its ok for you then just keep at it i guess, after i hit 28 i personaly cant stand a behaviour like this, even if it doesnt affect myself directly. True relationships are one of the focal points of life and why its matter, how you acquire some form of happiness. People that befriend you for benefits and suddenly pull out when they see that you arent worth the trouble are scum of the earth.
On the closing point, i had around 12 net friends on the discord while i use to play mmo, all whitin the same group. We talked to eachpther daily, sonetimes even hourly, some of us even opened up and cared for each eachother. Even with that I knew that after i stop playing we will cut ties and i wasnt wrong. Friends like that help you with copeing, passing the time, thats it.

It really sucks, but its life, dont mind the other guy. People are individuals, they take what they need and move on. You are all emotional, some people can and are behaving this way in some relationships, but most of people have cba mentality. The thing that hurt the most is the diverse look on the same relationship from the involved parties, if you are emotinal and care for said person it hurts like losing a loved one. People will give you shit and call it immature, but its bullshit. Im a very logocal person, but i search for empathy/caring when it comes to relatioships. People which just want to pass the time are no diffrent than npcs, be proud that you care, because it makes you solid.
<comment>
My friend is indeed autistic. I wonder how much of this is a guy vs girl thing? Maybe it is because I'm a foid and foids tend to be more open with one another that I never really thought about this before. Or I really am just delusional.
Thanks. I am scared of opening myself up again though. I've always loved the people in my life much more than they loved me. Which wouldn't be too bad if it was somewhat more even, but it's not.

Is it true
No it's not. No one categorizes people like that, only into groups like highschool boys, college guys, family, workmates, etc. and these don't necessarily reflect how close they are, it's for purposes of inside jokes, appropriate subjects, language registry, etc.
What does loving someone even mean if not enjoying their company and spending time with them?
Everyone is different, emotionally reserved people may not open up about their feelings but it doesn't mean they don't listen to you or care about yours. I've had friends I could listen to for hours while they complain, without expecting "my turn" or whatever, ones with which we would talk back and forth about whatever we found interesting, others with which we'd just stay quiet and watch videos and so on. It's all normal and of course I'd think about them throughout the day.
If your friend did commit suicide it's because his life was just that bad, why would he consider others during his last choice if he didn't even have the time or energy to care about himself. He probably did care about you most other days.
Also, if you're female, the guy that told you that sounds manipulative, the dynamic wouldn't be the same as if you're male.
I'm bad at putting thoughts into words plus ESL, so sorry if this isn't easy to read.

Will you be my friend? Do you have a boyfriend?

Nah, it's entirely possible to enjoy people's company, even regularly, without loving them. This is specifically true around hobbies.

This is part of what makes this a vicious cycle, people get close to others until they get burned then they no longer try with others, which is also partly why it gets harder to make new friendships as you get older. I say that if we crave these close emotional connections, we can't give up, we have to keep trying and accept that failure, pain and regret becomes reoccuring until we find the right people. You don't have to have a need for a sense of belonging, but if you do, don't keep suffering alone just because you're scared of getting hurt again. It will happen more than likely but that's okay as long as you are motivated to keep trying.

thanks for sharing. it makes me very happy to see """fembots""" get poetic justice like this.
<comment>
Only autistic people do that shit, male or female. If a normal person spends that much time with you they're into you.
<comment>
This is a bit excessive. I could never spend that much time with any single one person, but I'm also not part of the Discord generation or that whole mental health scene. Meaning I don't really know or understand the habits you describe here.
Normally I would answer: of course there's close friends and just "hangout friends" who enjoy the same activities as me... but your scenario is just an a whole other level, idk, this is too much time invested into a single person who doesn't even reciprocate. Will always lead to disaster.
<comment>
oh and adding on to that, you should of course consider that some people are just self-absorbed egomonsters who might find it normal that others "serve" them, depending on how they grew up etc. that's always a possibility.
<comment>
Most social relationships are basically how obligated am I to commit violence on your behalf. If I wanted to be violent I'd probably have a lot more to show for it.
<comment>
100p true, as long as you see others as tools. Look the dudes who keep girls around just so they can fuck them and put up with their personalities. Not saying all relationships are like this though.
<comment>
No. This is manipulative weirdo shit and/or gigs-autism. The normal thing is to spend time with people you care about and to come to care about people because you've spent time with them. They feed into each other.

You guys live in a bizarre fantasy where everyone either loves you or is some manipulator. It's not black and white like that at all, and like I said, it's most visible in any hobby scene. I'd say there are at least two types of connections that form through hobbies, that aren't truly friendships, but are still positive: 
1) Casual acquaintances. You see this in any group hobby, such as sports, card games, tabletop games, arcade games, etc. Local scenes will have regulars, and the regulars will come to know each other, and perhaps enjoy each other's company. Some hobbies lend themselves better to social aspects than others, particularly slow ones like pool, or tabletop wargames, since they give more time to talk. People can get to know each other, they can joke around, and end up liking each other, and still never really progress beyond that. I used to play X-Wing Miniatures, and I got to know lots of people through it. Some people I genuinely looked forward to seeing again. We never hung out outside of that context though, and even though we knew some things about each other, we never really got to really know each other. 
2) Mentor - Apprentice relationships. This one is more for solo hobbies that require considerable skill, such as various disciplines of art. One guy is an enthusiastic newcomer to the hobby, and talks to more experienced hobbyists, looking for advice, feedback, and fanboying over the experienced dudes. The other guy is one such experienced dude, who is happy to share his skills and love for the hobby with this enthusiastic newcomer. They meet up regularly at conventions, exchange contact info and share progress on their latest projects, but once again, they might never progress beyond that. The relationship is based entirely around a shared love for something, and even though they enjoy talking to each other, it is always through the context of that something.
<comment>
To clarify, I do think that OP's situation is weird and sketchy, I just disagree with the notion that you that if you enjoy spending time with someone you must therefore care for them. There are relationships that never progress very deeply, but are still good and enjoyable.

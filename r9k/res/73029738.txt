we have fMRIs that show being socially rejected lights up the same areas in your brain as physical pain does. it makes no evolutionary sense. in order to function socially in the world you have to train yourself into taking rejection with equanimity, same way as you'd have to train yourself into keeping your hand on a hot stove. there's no other way to make yourself keep trying till you learn the skills. why must it be this way
because we are social animals?
there is objectively no greater insult than rejecting a person, particularly rejecting a man sexually. it says "you are so worthless and disgusting that i don't want any more people like you to exist." 
Any man who remains in the company of an unrelated woman who would reject him is a simpcuck bitch self-hating low self-esteem retard.
but you can't exactly control whether an individual person rejects you or not, all you can do is learn from the experience and move on. but all you usually learn is "don't try and talk to or connect with anyone, because it's painful"
but you can't exactly control whether an individual person rejects you or not,
i didn't mention anything about control anywhere in my post. what are you talking about?

no you can't. the reasons for sexual rejection of men by women aren't learnable things. they're genetic and fixed. tall height and handsome face for men.

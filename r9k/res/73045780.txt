My sister has gone to the hospital to be by her side as she dies. The stories that are coming back are too horrible for words. Apparently, she is in severe pain and is lashing out at people, getting angry. It's really UGLY man. While I still feel bad the BFF who is dying, I am also feeling a slight anger at her for disrespecting my sister. I don't claim that this is morally justified, but it's how I feel now.

Can I haba da pussy please boss ?
Stop posting your shit link everywhere, nobody cares
Yea some people want to push away everyone before death, they see and feel they are burden. But people are nice, so they be nasty. Or sometimes cancer hits the head and they lose all empathy. It sucks, but let your sister handle it, if she sees fit. You just support her, as this is what she needs most at the moment.

The specific problem is that zoomers have no concept of a problem too petty or too common to gripe about. Everyone sometimes has to take a big nasty shit that kinda hurts, but zoomers somehow seem to think that universal human irritations and limitations are slights against them personally that need to be rectified. Take incels for example - striking out sexually is a normal part of life that can happen to everyone, but incels want to literally enslave all women so they don't have to face rejection. Zoomer logic.
Gooby pls....
Yeah, I'm sure that mentality is really good for society. Are there levels to it at least? Spinal paralysis means they can spit on you? A broken arm is worth a few insults? Slip and fall and someone else is the nigger for it? Come on Mr. mature boomer, tell us all about how sociopathic you guys are.

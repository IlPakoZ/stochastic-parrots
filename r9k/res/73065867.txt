30yo virgin here, I was described by several arthoe type girls as beautiful and pretty. What am I doing wrong?

A couple women have told me I have pretty eyes and that they were jealous of my eyebrows and eyelashes. That was a long time ago though.

Women and men compared me to various big time actors before, I always think they are fucking with me though.

What actor? Steve buscemi?

A few older/unattainable women have claimed that I am handsome and photograph well. Others say I have a good voice.
I am a bald manlet who is too aspie to work, so I am still incel as fuck at nearly 37. Never been flirted with or propositioned IRL.
At this point, I'd happily accept a barren MILF/GILF who wanted to keep my balls drained.

Lack of trying, most likely.

What have you even tried? Sounds like you wasted your youth.

Yeah loads of times I also had GFs the only reason I'm a virgin is because I'm a shutin and terrified of sex.

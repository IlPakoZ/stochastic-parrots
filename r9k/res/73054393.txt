Why do normies constantly preach "Darwinism" "survival of the fittest" "might makes right" "the weak should fear the strong" "if you're a victim you deserve it" and even "karma" to justify their bullying of others. But when one their bully victim fights back it's suddenly not Darwinism anymore? What's up with that?

One's social order the other's vengeance
You'll get it later on

ive never actually heard normies preaching darwinism. they generally virtue signal how bullying is bad. faggots here that were bullied themselves preach darwinism tho
<comment>
for a guy depicting a 'jock' that sure is one flabby jaw
<comment>
its just redditors and fsggots here like you said that preach darwinism

I'm more of a social creationist *chortles*

redditors wouldn't preach (social) darwinism because it's racist.
<comment>
you underestimate the power of double think, its only racist when its inconveniant.
Who needs consistancy when you're on the right side of history?

<comment>
your revenge fantasies are fucked up

You do make a solid point about your average redditor

This photo looks different. I think a lot of the people in that picture are dead.

it's like 10 years old at this point but I'm guessing the average redditard looks pretty much the same

I'm saying that I think that there's a lot of dead people in that photo.

to justify
Already answered your own question. Flimsy justification for their in-groups and out-groups. The same knucklefucks that will tell you Christ loves everyone will turn around and bully someone to death because they're "weird". Everything they say is phony moralizing and posturing for social credit, they don't really mean it.

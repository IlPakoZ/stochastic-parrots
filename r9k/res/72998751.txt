I'm a 24 year old Femanon (not femcel since they don't exist). Also a neet with no social interactions and it's getting to me pretty badly. I can't leave my house a lot because of health issues. I collect old video game for 6 years (pic is a part of my collection but i got more) and built gunpla for fun.
<comment>
You sound precious, femanon. Hope you make some friends!
<comment>
Thanks I hope so too I'm not the best at making friends
<comment>
Can I see your gunpla?
<comment>
Wow this is awesome, you are amazing girl
<comment>
Here I go also 2 more !
<comment>
1. what is your body count
2. we all know you are a whore
<comment>
bunjikuga#5906
Nice pic btw
<comment>
2 they are from my ex boyfriends I had when I was 16 und 18
<comment>
The last neet I was friends with made me think we were super close chatting every day for 3 years and then ghosted me out of nowhere. I have pretty big trust issues now when it comes to both woman and neets. But you'll have no problems finding "friends" here.
<comment>
Do you ever buy Figma?
<comment>
Also man you have a shitton of DSes
<comment>
Got a ton of anime figures and I think yea I should have some
<comment>
Got one more 3ds also this is just my hand held storage
<comment>
Virginity resets every two years anyway
<comment>
You are by far the most interesting person we have found so far, thank you for showing us your collection
<comment>
Oh shit nice Burma figure. And that retarded lookin eevee lmao
<comment>
Got a lot more I grew up with a n64 and ever since I played video games
<comment>
"tee hee i only fucked 2 guys before 18 but im a REAL fembot guys, im a REAL neet, please give me attention, im not like the other girls! im not a whore, no really im not! tee hee"
go get raped by a nigger and kill yourself
<comment>
Got a ton of anime figures
Figures. You think it's okay to financially support Goodsmile? A company with links to the far right hacker website 4chan?
<comment>
She was the first figure I bought and now I got so many starting to run out of space
<comment>
Mh that's hard but I think just like artists I separate the art from the artist. But mostly buy them used
No I'm definitely like other girls i would say
<comment>
I have a lot of those but some of mine are badly broken
Game cube: i couldn't get the case of because of safety screws the disk wouldn't spin, so I ripped the case of and played the game without the case. (stupid I know)
I found a SNES boxed in someones trash and took it home. it was badly yellowed but worked with the GameCube power pack, think I have Earth Worm Jim 2 boxed for it.
PS2 boxed the fat one, but the controller no longer works
PS1 boxed but that has yellowed in part
I really should have made a set up like yours
<comment>
lol i'm going to buy more now
<comment>
That's really cool! The yellowing can be remove if you are willing to put in the work but I think you need special screwdriver for that
<comment>
How do you afford so much stuff anon as a neet 
Kind of jealous you still have all your old consoles and games and stuff though lol
<comment>
lol i'm going to buy more now
Wow. Check out the edge on this guy
<comment>
 All that videogame shit
Youre a tranny aren't you?
I have nothing against trans people, unlike a lot of people on here. 
Your hands seemed a bit manly in that one picture, so the odds are on my side here
<comment>
Most of them are from my childhood but I used to work up until a year ago. It's a lot because I slowly bought more and more
<comment>
How can I prove that I'm not one ?
<comment>
You got a cord OP?
<comment>
For what? Sorry my English isn't the best
<comment>
Like a discord. Also what language
<comment>
How can I prove that I'm not one ?
You don't need to prove shit to anyone, your collection is nice
<comment>
Post timestamped vag. How else can you prove bio-woman?
<comment>
Typ R-510#7108
Ah I'm german
<comment>
Of my hand ? Because face is not allowed here
<comment>
Says youre Not accepting friend requests lmao
<comment>
What's it like to live in Germany?
<comment>
So now sorry didn't see it was off
It's ok people are pretty closed off and I'm in the countryside its pretty nice here but the major citys are hell or at least Frankfurt and berlin
<comment>
major citys are hell
Is this because of the amount of people or because it is violent and full of criminals?
<comment>
Full of drugs you can see them everywhere and junkies in general are a huge problem lot's of place were you could skate 10 years ago are full of homeless people now
<comment>
Is my hand really that manly ?
<comment>
Wow. Check out the edge on this guy
Just for you
<comment>
Just for you
Thanks I love it
<comment>
Looks kinda big wouldn't say it's super manly though. How tall are you anon
<comment>
I'm 5'2 also 105lb and funny because a lot of people say I got the hands of a child
<comment>
Iorb#3079
<comment>
Oh it might just be perspective. Yeah then idk what that guy was getting at with the manly hand thing. Looks a bit vascular I guess I'm not sure if that's a manly trait
Looks like you have a feminine digit ratio too so idk why that guy is saying it's manly
<comment>
Sound like everywhere these days, my areas in the UK it has gone to shit, litter all over the streets, near the local shops are full of beggars and people selling drugs,
When I go to work in the mornings I see people looking in peoples businesses and walking around looking for cigarette ends on the floor
This is why I stay indoors on my days off
<comment>
Mh oh well it's 4chan but a person in my family said i should transition because I'm into guy stuff and in general dress like a tomboy
<comment>
UK sounds like a scary ass place to me these days you just get macheted for nothing and dudes having sword fights in the streets and shit medieval era shit
<comment>
Yea used to work in the big city and had to clean up used needles sometimes it's gross and i hated it
<comment>
In London probably, i'm in the North it is calm up here but there are random hotpots of violence, usually over people owing others money and not getting paid

Here it's the main train station which sucks
<comment>
Funny, I wish people here did speak like that
You Scallywags!!
<comment>
Here
Idk another picture of your hand? Maybe holding that silver SP
<comment>
What's a silver sp?
<comment>
The gameboy sp you have. Or any of those handhelds idc
<comment>
I'd show you my tits if you drop a discord. Honestly, I'm just here because I'm extremely lonely.
<comment>
Used a rule too this time
<comment>
Op what is you medical issue stopping you from leaving the house?
<comment>
You ever get into the battle network series for gba? They just recently released them all as package games for the switch.
<comment>
I want to jizz on your hand just so you can slap me with it
<comment>
I have knee injurys that had to be fixed it was 2 years and 5 years ago (both kneecaps had to be fixed) but now I'm in a lot of pain again 
Omg it's the megaman spin-off right? I wanted to play that after finishing final fantasy tactics advanced that's so cool!
<comment>
I have knee injurys that had to be fixed it was 2 years and 5 years ago (both kneecaps had to be fixed) but now I'm in a lot of pain again
Sorry you are in pain
*rubs your toes
<comment>
it's the megaman spin-off right?
I think so? An anime use air and they made video games based off of it, here's the trailer: https://youtu.be/5anP8oC-ePY [Embed] 
It was my favorite series on that handheld system.
<comment>
It's ok the sad part is that i hade to give up skating.
<comment>
An anime use air and they made video
*An anime use to air and then they made video
<comment>
I gotta play it man i remember seeing the game looks so cool
<comment>
Oh and i have to look if i can do ballet again i really hope so need to train more again
<comment>
sorry, I can't be friends with someone that didn't miss out on teenage love
<comment>
Team colonel, megan blue and the cybeast were my favorites. I feel like this series was criminally underrated. Tbf, in my eyes it went to to toe with pokemon and was arguably better.
<comment>
Awe sorry anon I hope you can find someone else 
Yea that's always a sad fade a lot of good games just didn't sell good enough and got canceled
<comment>
Very nice hand actually. 
How big of a commer are you?
<comment>
Would say the meds killed all urges for that
<comment>
hi sobot
<comment>
Have you tried VR on the PS4PRO?
That is some amazing experience that you can use sitting down
<comment>
Are you a virgin too? Because I am a 24 year old khhv femcel and I am trying to determine if we would make good pals
<comment>
Was thinking about it when i have money again sounds like real fun
<comment>
Sadly no but it's been years since then like a good 7 years
<comment>
It is unbelievable to experience, there are some games that feel like demos but you can find some fun ones, I really like just finding worlds to sit in and explore.
If you are good at designing you can pretty much build and design your own game (Dreams)
<comment>
good 7 years
That means you are a virgin again lol
<comment>
That's what i love about games just exploring a totally different wolrd! >>72999762
Oh really ? Didn't know that

giwtwm
<comment>
Was thinking because I'm used goods that no one would want me. i also only got hit on by older men whats kinde wired because i look so young
<comment>
I was joking about the virgin part but some people seems to say it, Yeah the worlds are really engaging .
I first tried out the VR Worlds and there is a Fun underwater cage demo with fish and a shark at the bottom, that got me hooked. Now i'm downloading games and testing them all to find the best ones.
If I find a good one I buy the physical copy
REZ was the one I got from America was a little more expensive but i'm happy I bought it
Some games with zombies are pretty much a "NOPE!" not touching that and I throw the VR headset and sit there sweating
<comment>
Was thinking because I'm used goods that no one would want me
it doesn't work like that in this world, girls get 100% attention and you might not feel it but you can never be unwanted.
<comment>
used goods
pick me
What a catch boys
<comment>
I hate ugly people they me sick
<comment>
Ok that sound amazing i think as soon as i have money i will get one!
Yea i guess you are right just hard when i physically can't leave my home that's why I'm looking for friends onlo
<comment>
dont give this faggot attention sage this shit you idiots.
<comment>
Spank your ass and put you in a diaper
<comment>
Oh also played Subnautica once in vr and by god i was scared so badly
<comment>
older men are ephebophiles
<comment>
I remember them being married and i could be there kid was wired.also always get asked for id when i buy alcohol. Kinda uncomfortable when they see I'm over 18
<comment>
That game was phenomenal at scaring the crap out of me. I don't think I could play it in VR but I loved the first one, just swimming out into deep water and then hearing that sound of the Reaper
<comment>
Fucked ne up good but kinda love that feeling of being scared that's why i love horror games or dark games
<comment>
stop posting in /mentallyill9000/ if you want actual friends. Just join a discord or IRC or forum or whatever related to something you like and get in the voice chat.
<comment>
The reaper grabbing your ship is the worst feeling ever
<comment>
Ohhh ok good idea i should di that thanks!
<comment>
Imagine that in vr I would die of a heart attack
<comment>
The only way I can use it in PSVR is with only a big screen inside the headset, like being at the cinema in your own home, not proper VR but seeing that would make me fear for my life. I would love it tho
<comment>
It's amazing how was technology advanced so far now i really want a vr
<comment>
Sometimes when my friend stays at mine (he drives me to his work to gain more work hours) I set up the VR for him, and he loves it, I just let him experience the games, truly is the future of gaming
<comment>
Go on ebay Germany and see how much they are going for, The last time I looked they were really cheaper,
Just make sure it's the PSVR2 version for PS4 and get the move controllers
<comment>
I love sharing my games did that a lot when i was way younger then now
<comment>
Good idea i will keep that in mind
<comment>
Yeah when I was in high school and college I used to have everyone at mine, it was a local pit stop for people, we all used to play games about 10 people squashed into a small room, I miss it but everyone has to work
<comment>
I want to work again really badly and just buy games and other stuff. Kinda funny how i disliked work and now i miss it
<comment>
That is exactly how I felt when Covid happened, I was working then we got shut down by the government and all their rules got me fired because ehe business couldn't run, so I just played games for a year and lived inside my home, then when we were allowed back out I was so happy to get a job again and buy more games. Funny how I always hated going work now Love it
<comment>
Was a shit time if I'm honest. God i have to clean the house today but i want to play games
<comment>
I don't mind just being alone and doing my own thing, that's why i'm on here, it's alone and peaceful, I don't need to be that guy for everyone. I can come and go as a please and interact on my own terms. Sure sometimes I get that itch to be with people. Clean your house you filthy urchin!! joke 
Do both, with your bad knees you can take do it in small stages. start with the smallest place that needs cleaning, then play a game for an hour, then do the next clean
<comment>
Since I'm not working right now and still at home duo to covid I do all the cleaning in the house it's helping a bit with moving my knee
<comment>
skating? are u frm canada
<comment>
No sadly germany
<comment>
do girls wear those cute dresses during oktoberfest, did u wear them? also how is it being a neet, why did u quit ur job, are you university educated? i always wonder how other neet anons are doing
<comment>
Can you not do squats? like I know it will hurt to do a small number of squats, it could make it move better, and take Glucosamine &amp; Chondroitin that is meant to help knees, yeah i'm not advising you to do any of my crazy ideas, in case you get hurt
Yes just ignore me
<comment>
They mostly only wear them in bavaria not where i am but i did wear one and it's pretty cool there. I had to quit because my knees got worse (both kneecaps are operated on a few years ago but still hurt). Hate being a neet i kinda miss work a lot and not staying alone at home. I miss just basic interactions with people and i see no one expect my parents. I don't have to pay for food or rent but I do all the cleaning at home
<comment>
Nah all good. I'm slowly training so that i can do more and more with my knees. Started with simple walks need to train the muscles so that i can do squats and all that stuff
<comment>
i assume you talked to a doctor about it? does it hurt when u sit?
<comment>
Yea i have regular visits with a doctor. Can't sit in one position for long because then they start hurting
<comment>
Also a neet with no social interactions
How did you end up that way when you had boyfriends in the past?
<comment>
Had to drop out of college because of injuries and that was when I was single already. Everyone promised me to come see me but no one did ever since then i had no friends just people I saw once and then never again
<comment>
Also stayed in hospital 1 year was a bit far away from home so yea shitty luck
<comment>
everyone always promises to help you or see you but they never do
<comment>
How did you injure yourself?
<comment>
True was pretty heartbreaking for me 
There not enough cartilage around my kneecap had shitty luck and they fell out that happened in winter and i was in the snow then duo to my over all poor health i got a fever and almost died
<comment>
Well good luck with your cleaning GermanAnon, My protein shakes just arrived with a delivery guy and want to make sure they are OK, I managed to get 8 large chocolate tubs for 75% off (super Excited) Really had fun with your thread and seeing all your cool stuff.
Hope you find people to cheer you up and get back to being active.

what vidya/anime are you favorite, any games youve been playing recently or stuff you watch recently
<comment>
Thanks that really kind of you I got even more stuff
<comment>
Disgusting, mentally ill whore. Sage in all fields.
The only sensible response ITT.
<comment>
God dammit, you are gonna make me addicted to staying here
<comment>
I really love smt right now playing smt 3 nocturne and finished ff9 before that. Love turn based games and horror games the most
<comment>
Wanna see more ?
<comment>
Sure but let me make a protein shake and then get comfy, just post and I will be 5 minutes
<comment>
What were you in college for? If you have nothing to do at home, you can use the opportunity to find a passion/gain a skill with online courses.
<comment>
Why did you have no friends when you coukd get boyfriends?
<comment>
Business but i didn't like it at all my parents pushed me to do it
<comment>
do you have a nice/cute voice, have you ever thought about doing asmr or streaming vidya
<comment>
Had "friends" back then but they all left me behind as soon as i was sick since then i didn't connect with anyone and was pretty awkward since in my childhood/teenage years i was bullied. Never really learned how to talk and trust people what ended up into social anxiety
<comment>
Sadly i do not have a pc right now waiting for my money to come here. Mh i would say my voice is ok you can hear my accent a bit and would probably stream games for my friends not so much for others
<comment>
Never really learned how to talk and trust people
Then how did you have boyfriends if you didn't talk to them or trusted them?
<comment>
having to computer sucks, sounds painful
<comment>
I have no solution for you as a 28 year old friendless female neet. I vented about being friendless and having trouble connecting with other woman and some woman on here told me that the only way to make friends is to do it 1 on 1 in pm. I haven't tried it yet but it sounds like a better bet than joining group chats and hoping not to get bullied or lost in the sauce
I know how it feels OP
<comment>
Never trusted him fully always thought he was wired me because of my looks or body same goes for friendships I always think they want money of something else that's also a reason why i broke up with him and have been single for so long
<comment>
Hm. What's your timezone? If you're not too far behind/ahead we can be frens, actually frens, no bs catch to it.
<comment>
Ohhh why 
Yea maybe that's the best but doesn't really work irl because if you meet a guy alone he gets the wrong idea maybe works with girls
<comment>
Germany that's where i am haha
<comment>
It's not that bad as it might set you up with a comfy office job, considering you can't even waitress with that condition. But as I said, make the best out of your time as neet or you'll regret it badly in a few years. Speaking from experience.
<comment>
i meant no computer* also its probably better 1 on 1 because in a group chat or general chat you have weird oribting behavior or youre an outsider and cant get a word in
<comment>
Men and women can't be friends they will always want to fuck us even if they pretend they don't even if they have a gf. They want to fuck us
<comment>
Ah I'm german
any explanation why the kinkiest porn online is german?
<comment>
Was thinking about learning polish since i am half polish but it seems hard. Was learning korean but those damn kpop fans ruined it for me. Love there fashion and wanted to stay there for a year to see something different. But no kpop fans ruins it for me
<comment>
Yea was thinking to work in a library or archive. 
That's true sadly 
I think because we are closed up and pretty cold and stressed out maybe
<comment>
I dont know what to say but that is unfortunate to hear about your situation. If you cannot leave the house try to crack open a window every once in a while as it will help
What health issues wouldnt let you leave your house that sounds awful
<comment>
I'm UK. You wanna trade contacts? I can post a throwaway email since I don't believe it's a good idea posting your actual discord tags on here
<comment>
Oh god I think I drank way too much, I used a Kaltenberg two pint glass full of protein milk
Kingdom hearts 3 picture?
I loved that game, even if it was hated
<comment>
You seem to think quite highly of yourself, I'm friends with some women and don't want to fuck them. I already have a gf, I don't want to downgrade by cheating on her. Any armchair psychology cope you come up with doesn't change this.
<comment>
they will always want to fuck us
Let's assume this is 100p true, this doesn't mean they will push for it. If they make sexual comments or whatever, I get not wanting anything more to do with them if they are relentless. Can you not have a friendship with that in mind? Also, can you just become friends with a really good looking dude? Chances are, he probably won't find you attractive or just rather fuck a bunch of other girls.
<comment>
Knees are fucked walking currently hurts a lot it's sad too look outside sometimes seeing all the birds and deers makes me want to go out. 
Yea would be nice!
I need to play 2 first but then i will play 3 can't wait! And don't drink so much haha
<comment>
Instead of being aggressive, can you not approach her with solutions?
<comment>
Can you not fuck off and mind your own business? That's a better idea, simp cunt.
<comment>
Stop derailing because reality makes you butthurt
<comment>
This is completely untrue, I've been friends with tons of women and don't want to fuck them. Do I want to see them naked? Sometimes, but that's just because I like looking at attractive women and it gives me a rush.
<comment>
And the saga continues!
<comment>
askybluesky@proton.me (caps sensitive) if you want to trade contacts details it's just a throwaway email easy to make lol
<comment>
how fat are you exactly, piggy?
<comment>
I need to play 2 first but then i will play 3 can't wait! 
Kingdom hearts 2 is said to be the best one.
And don't drink so much haha
I should be ok, I'm practically a giant
You really have loads!!
<comment>
Ok done i send it hope you get it
<comment>
That looks quite cool! Hope you can make some friends you seem to be nice.
Asking for a friend.. would you (try to) become friends with someone you don't really share interests with? This friend of mine doesn't really have any interests and as a result he has nothing to talk about with anyone..
<comment>
Yea collecting really long now
<comment>
Of course! We don't need to have the same interests to be friends and theres for sure other things to talk about
<comment>
I have also just sent a reply, let me know if there's any issues
<comment>
How is this derailing? Both her and OP want friends and ignoring have the population will make this harder than it needs to be.
<comment>
How do I ignore someone?
<comment>
Hi im a 25 yo femanon and you seem cool. I would like to be friends
<comment>
Yes would be cool do you have discord?
<comment>
I don't understand your question. I was just saying refusing to be friends with the opposite sex cuts your chances down to half.
<comment>
Okay, thats a good thing, at least it isnt respiratory etc. Do you have a porch or something? Set up a lawnchair outside maybe? 
My girlfriend is a physiotherapist, if you want ill put my discord down and i can ask her about your condition and if she recommends anything to help.
<comment>
Fuck anon you have a really nice collection, you have some shit I've considered buying but decided against like the japanese GBC games and the rem and gawain statues how recently did you get that Alm amiibo? I've been trying to find Alm and Celica since they came out and could never find them in any store.
<comment>
But i don't ignore the opposite sex i just don't get to know anyone anymore 
I'm sometimes sit in the garden but i just get lonely because my parents work all day and I'm alone
<comment>
I got them randomly quite some time ago in a store!
<comment>
Well shit, I probably won't have much luck then. I bought the game when it came out and really fell in love with it, I had only played the GBA games and nu-fire emblem when it came out and to this day remake Alm is my second favourite lord, and Celica a cute. Do you actively go around and buy stuff for your collection or just add to it randomly?
<comment>
Love figures so much the spice up every part of my collection got a really big card captor sakura one
<comment>
Activity looking for stuff especially flee markest and sometimes ebay or stores
<comment>
Oh shit, post your Sakura anon! I've been wanting to buy a Sakura figure for a while but just can't bring myself to do it, I only have 3 DB statues I keep on display and I feel like if I buy any more people will start asking questions.
<comment>
Nice, you find anything good recently or looking for something in particular that's evaded you for a while? Right now I'm looking for Bloody Roar for the PS1, I've got primal fury, extreme and 3 and I'm hoping to have the entire series in a few years. I haven't had much luck though, mostly just been buying niche switch games I find for cheap at the nearest used games store and going to a really big retro Vidya sale that happens one every few months in my area, I'm hoping they'll have a sega saturn one of these days, I had one as a kid but sold it when I was 14 for a couple hundred dollars with panzer dragoon and I regret it immensely.
<comment>
There you go! I love her so much big passion for her 
Currently smt games i love them so mich but some of them cost a ton and sega saturn is on my list of stuff i need
<comment>
That's good to hear, he's been kinda busy lately but I'll drop his discord in case you want to text him

<comment>
This is my figure collection so far, I just preordered the Guyver 2.0, but those are so expensive now, I haven't bought for a few years as of COVID
I hopefully can set up a room like yours with all my stuff but where I live we get broken into so I am keeping everything in boxes and MISB
I think I need to be sick, OMG why did I think I was so clever, I can't even move, I think I am gonna try and afternoon nap for an hour
take care Germananon
<comment>
two sakuras
I'm insanely jealous, I was actually thinking about buying the one on the right yesterday but I can't afford it this month... I just started watching Sakura a few months ago and it's honestly one of the comfiest shows I've ever watched, it looks amazing and it's just so nice, I hate that my first magical girl show was madoka and it turned me off from magical girls for a few years. 
What SMT game are you playing right now? I just recently start 5 because my friend said it was pretty gud and I never bothered to beat it, and I'm thinking of maybe playing last bible 3 soon.
<comment>
You too have a nice nap and the figures are so cool!
<comment>
I grew up with card captor sakura so she has a special place in my heart and playing smt 3. 5 was pretty nice
<comment>
buyfag with poop taste
0% surprised. Your N64 collection is decent though. Does daddy give you PPP or do you have neetbuxx or a job?
<comment>
I've heard nocturne is really fugging good, I've been meaning to play it but I can't find a copy anywhere and I don't know how good the remaster is so I'm not touching it. though I haven't found any copies of nocturne I've gotten 2/4 of the original .hack// games CIB so I can't complain too much about my luck with PS2 games. I refuse to emulate anything for some godforsaken reason unless there's a translation patch and my wallet suffers for it.
I wish I could've grown up watching Sakura, you're lucky anon but I probably started collecting vidya at an earlier age :^)
You ever sell any of your collection? I've got an extra copy of pokemon XD I've been tempted to sell but I don't know if it's worth it.

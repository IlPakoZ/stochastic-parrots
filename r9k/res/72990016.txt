Why are people looked down upon for being alone/seeking solitude?

It scares normies who NEED constant attention and validation. Once my mom dies, I'll inherit the house and live all alone. It'll be so fucking comfy. I'll have 3 bedrooms, finished basement, and 1.5 bathrooms all to myself.

Yes, I expect her to die one day. I expect myself to die one day too. I expect every living person and thing on this planet to die one day. How fucking retarded are you?

They assume it's not your choice, they assume there's something wrong with you which is why you're alone, they're assume you're incompetent and can't attract others, that you're boring, not interesting, not worth to be around.

how can you have half a bathroom? wtf

Probably, one has only a toilet and nothing else. At least as a plumber I think that's what he means.

Why do you have so few bathrooms. Mine only has 5 bedrooms but 6.5 bathrooms.

half bathroom is one with just a toilet &amp; sink, no shower
Cheap house built in the early 80s. Small city that's cheap and affordable. All the big homes are in the next city over that's majority jewish and every home starts at a million.

Because normal fags literally cannot comprehend anything that deviates outside of what the average person does. Also when they're alone they have nothing to do because everything they do involves a third party.

Because its been proven a million times over that human connection literally makes you live longer and is the most important part of being happy.

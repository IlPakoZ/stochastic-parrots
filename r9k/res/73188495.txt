Last shots guys
I listened to it once through before trying to do it, how the fuck is anyone meant to read Polish, it's so hard? Where's my god damn phonetic version? https://voca.ro/121ujXITJdxe
HIIII
dont bother with the 3rd verse, no one does lmfao
I was just reading the lyrics from the YouTube video. Was the 3rd verse the one with Napoleon in it? I did not expect that.
Thanks for the compliments girl. 
I'll have you know that I've seen a million faces, and I've ROCKED them all!!!!
https://vocaroo.com/1i6ls4eh5u6D
No no, Napoleon is in the 2nd, from 3rd to 4th is for formal stuff (and 5-6 is not a part of the anthem at all) so dont bother I meant kek
ALSO I kinda hate how we sucked Napoleons dick despite everything he has done to us lmfao, as much as I dont like Zeromski (polish writer) he accurately depicted in his book Popioly how Napoleon didnt give two shits about us during that time kek he used us as cannon fodder in his other battles promising that once he conquers other enemies he will help us get back independence but turned out only (not really) doing anything out of sheer coincidence kek
ALSO ALSO there is a movie adaptation of Popioly which has this very shitty film shooting backstory. The most famous polish director ever who made it, Wajda (the same guy who made Czlowiek z marmuru) actually made a real horse die on purpose during the shoot to get the more realistic effect in one scene. 
Tldr FUCK NAPOLEON 
https://voca.ro/1lKfkFhk2Bwc
God i wish I was home alone to scream lyrics like that too ;_;
Picrel is how I imagine you rn kek
if you ain't singing your heart out why bother? That's my motto, same with drinking, dancing and fucking.
https://vocaroo.com/15iU48HmKqR4
Wait Napoleon is mentioned in your national anthem in a positive light? I assumed it was like that song you linked the other day that contains a bit that says (paraphrasing) "fuck Germany". Wow, that's pretty messed up. 
You should add ALSOs to all of your responses now, even if they're totally irrelevant. You're cool, Polishanon.
https://voca.ro/18DmQnSc5cMD
Its been a while anons. Time to go back to messing around with this classic song.
T_T thank you anon you are beautiful
Pls it means:
Bonaparte has given us the example
Of how we should prevail.
Like? Lmfao
I wish Rota was the national anthem instead ngl or O moj rozmarynie, its hauntingly beautiful (but I guess a little less appropriate lyrics-wise to be one). 
ALSO thank you omg TmT you are cool too dude, I mean it &lt;3
BELIEVE ME IF I COULD I WOULD SCREAM MY LUNGS OUT, I cant wait for my parents to leave for the whole weekend, Im gonna ruin my throat on all bring me the horizon songs 
For now, Potop soundtrack it is
https://voca.ro/15COqOtCP5q2
10/10 Im gonna lay on the floor to this one
damn all the way up to the weekend, that's tough.
https://vocaroo.com/15h1lMKCRJL3 this is in your honor.
Bonaparte has given us the example
Oh yea, that's a fair historical view on him. Next, let's add Hitler and Stalin, screw it.
Rota was cool, I liked that one more, actual understanding of the lyrics aside. O moj rozmarynie definitely wouldn't fit as a national anthem, though.

Duh? Gonna get around to another film tomorrow, hoping one is available on 35mm.
Too kind anons. I'll give you this too.

Another floor stage banger thank you anon
Next, let's add Hitler and Stalin, screw it.
I mean, might as well. A FAIR share of polish people at that time actually cried when Stalin died bc they were completely unaware of his actions kek
O moj rozmarynie
We were banned from learning it too young because of the lyrics kek
DUDE ASFGHJL TTATT you are something else I swear
Best polish song ahead (ft. my retarded mumbles)
https://voca.ro/1kTJwE4EoUpE
ZAOPIEKUJ SIE MNAAAAAAA
Kino w chuj, I want to LIVE in this vocaroo
Damn, man, that was awesome! Shame about the mistake that I definitely heard, guess you'll just have to sing us another one?
Well in fairness to those Polish people, Stalin did a lot for you. Like...erm...and...? Siberia is a pretty cool holiday destination, I guess?
Damn, the last lyrics translated are:
Bayonet will sting me, death will kiss me
Bloody hell, should be the anthem of /r9k/. Looking forward to hearing you sing more out loud at the weekend. Terribly pronounced national anthems are the closest I get to singing, at least for now.
But not you.

Ok one last quick one.
https://voca.ro/104h3PGQljJH
it's uke time
https://voca.ro/12zR0BMSGG5u
the anthem of /r9k/
It really should lmfao, its basically the guy deciding to go to army and if she rejects him, to recklessly die on the battlefield and blaming her for it, even being like HA, NOW YOU ARE SAD? DONT YOU DARE CRY AT MY GRAVE BITCH IF YOU DIDNT REJECT ME I WOULDNT BE DEAD 
Which is incel tier goofy when explained this way, but I still love it so so much.
Especially the part about growing a lilac bush out of his deadly bayonet wound. Like?? Absolutely beautiful
Im waiting PATIENTLY then
Classic, good choice. And the rasp, berry noice
Eardrums gone, worth it

Hello r9k, am I ugly? What comes to mind when you see this person?
<comment>
you'r elooking a bit sideways there
<comment>
Well I had to turn my head sideways to see your pic. I didn't appreciate that, you could've used a photo editing app. Apart from that you have a long face but are fairly symmetrical. I rate 5/10.

nigga needs to go to my barber ASAP. Also the frame on those glasses have got to go, no discussion. Shop for smaller frames or go for contacts.
After that you're going to look like a stylish pretty motherfucker.

Get haircut, plain and simple. Be more happier.

Didn't mean for that to happen, took the photo on my phone and it was symmetrical in my camera roll

you actually have the power to look good if you got a normal haircut, better glasses or none altogether, worked out a lot, and have a friendlier expression and energy

I actually often get told to have a more positive demeanor, I don't really think it's something I can help though. Thank you nonetheless for your kind words, time, and suggestions.

Better face than me. I cry myself to sleep every night

You look like EXACTLY like a guy I dated. Does your name start with a J?

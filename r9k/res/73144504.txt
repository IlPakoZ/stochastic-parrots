to work and pay taxes to support single mothers and their children by tall handsome abusechads through the payment of taxes :)

the indomitablde human spirit will always win.
Even if nobody loves you, Jesus will always have a place for you in his heart.
<comment>
there is no answer to that question the only thing you can do is live for yourself and your desires 
or go the religious route and believe in a heaven after life
<comment>
So other people are more lovable by comparison

suffer. 
remind others that it could be worse.
like how hens will all peck at one hen until it dies. after it dies there is a brief chaos where they peck at eachother to establish the new order.

The point is to suffer and be a work mule for society until you pass gracelessly all alone in a dark apartment

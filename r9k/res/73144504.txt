Whats the point of life if youre unlovable
to work and pay taxes to support single mothers and their children by tall handsome abusechads through the payment of taxes :)
So the point of life is to neet until you inevitabely kill yourself
you can't neet if you're working like a good little cucky and paying your taxes to help nurture the cumloaf tall handsome abusechads are baking in the girls you crushed on :)
Money, raw power
lol @ you if you're unlovable
Ascending to the next plane of existence through your actions in this temporary world, heaven.
unlovable = unattractive
sucks to suck

the indomitablde human spirit will always win.
Even if nobody loves you, Jesus will always have a place for you in his heart.
there is no answer to that question the only thing you can do is live for yourself and your desires 
or go the religious route and believe in a heaven after life
So other people are more lovable by comparison
suffer. 
remind others that it could be worse.
like how hens will all peck at one hen until it dies. after it dies there is a brief chaos where they peck at eachother to establish the new order.
loving others :3 uwu
nothing buddy, nothing gonna happen anymore, a girl won't drop from the sky and land on your dick. you will probably be a wagecuck for most of your life and no catastrophic event will save you. have fun buddy!
if you're a Canuck, thank you for all the toys from the late 90s. Much appreciated.

He better be listening to Superman.
The point is to suffer and be a work mule for society until you pass gracelessly all alone in a dark apartment

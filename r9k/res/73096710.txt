Beards are for soibois

I don't shave or cut any hair on my body. they grow back fully after like 3 days so it's pointless

I look my best with a light stubble

I have thin facial hair, so I just use an electric razor. I have never used a normal razor, no need to, I'm gonna be 25 and it has barely changed since I was 20. I do have enough for a half-decent mustache, been growing it for three months now.

Get bowl of cold water
Wet face
Apply shaving cream
Shave
Repeat about once per week

beards are for who, white boy? say that again

Started using picrel recently. It is good if you want a clean shave, but it cuts the shit out of you if not used properly.

if I need to change my look because I know something is happening. then with sharp combat knife. like my grandfather did, middle of the forest. fast as trees always were looking, they still are

I keep my goatee and mustache because without it I look like a 16 year old. When my beard comes in and starts looking shitty, I go to my barber for a hot towel and strait razor shave. He's an old italian guy who has one of the last old school barber shops in my city. Absolutely fucking awesome too!

beards only work on non-whites. whites somehow manage to make anything look faggy

now you're moving the goal posts

Just use a 2 blade disposable razor. Water and shaving cream is annoying and messy. If I want a nicer shave I'll use a few drops of olive oil.

You have image issues because you have not sense of self outside of what you are allowed to commodify. That is why you are a sad sack of Shit.

I can't grow a beard but it doesn't matter anyway. Beard's makeup and makeup is for faggots.

i shave my face with a trimmer because its easiest and i dont have to use any foam or anything. the only time i let it grow out is if im being lazy, but i never go more than a 4 days because it gets really itchy. i generally dont give a fuck about my appearence except to be clean and presentable. i think most of the time guys with well-groomed beards are pretentious and have an ego. i dont care. im open to whatever its just what ive noticed.

I don't shave my beard I cut it with those scissors that you use to cut nails (pic related). It takes a long time because I cut them all individually but I really like the sensation I feel from cutting my beard this way.

Makeup has been worn by both sexes forever moron. Beards happen naturally, makeup is synthesized. So your point is double wrong. 
Avery actor, political, most pastors, anyone who does public speaking. Are men who wear makeup.

makeup as in you're trying to hide your genetic short comings. we all know beardcels are chinlets.

Mogs all of them

Beard's makeup
makeup doesn't grow out of your face, you fucking idiot

Beards are genetic. People don't hide genetic shortcomings with natural genetics.
Or maybe they just don't like shaving.
we all know beardcels are chinlets.
Oh yeah, like Gigachad, right?

hide your genetic short comings.
beards are literally genetic

Safety razor with shaving butter (the cans don't lubricate enough, avoid them). 
Start by wetting your face with warm water, or shave immediately after a shower. 
Lather with an almond sized amount of the butter. Shave with the grain in short strokes with the section of skin taut.
Never go against the grain. Go perpendicular to the grain on the second pass if you need to get a closer shave. 
Rinse with cold water. Use nonalcoholic astringent and finally moisturize.

I use an electric trimmer when my beard gets uncomfortably long - that is, if I can find the motivation. Right now I look like a crazy hobo. I don't care about my appearance because I am depressed and don't go outside.
<comment>
isn't this from american psycho?
<comment>
This is an odd sentiment because while it is true in many cases, like among men with a pre occupation with appearance and the language to describe male appearance in society (incels for example) most men do not think about these things at all. Your average normie grows a beard out, decides he likes how he looks with it, and that's the end of it. He never consciously tells himself "I'm coping with a beard hiding my lower third" like people on this board would do.

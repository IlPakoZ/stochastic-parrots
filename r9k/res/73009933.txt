I just ate a taco bell after trying to fast and I regret it. Best way to throw up?
<comment>
Through the mouth.

Is there anything else to it besides fingering my throat?
<comment>
Use the toothbrush
Also dont kneel in front of the toilet, bend over it

Quads don't lie. Thx anon. Will chugging water help too?
<comment>
You could take some ipecac but I really would just suggest gagging yourself with your fingers.

I frew up but there wasn't much chunks. Does that mean it wasn't enough? Should I barf more?
<comment>
i kinda feel the same way
yay bulimia!!!
<comment>
I just started but I think I'm on my way to eating disorder hell. Food is starting to make me panic
<comment>
And when I mean no chunks I mean it was mostly white

Forgive yourself and try again tomorrow. Nothing in the past matters. Beating yourself up will only make you feel worse. The present is what's important. Focus on not making the same mistakes again.

why is food making you panic

Also, don't fast. It makes your mind switch between two extremes. Food isn't black and white. It doesn't have to be no food at all or only goyslop. Slowly replace the junk food in your diet with healthy alternatives over the course of a few weeks. You will automatically lose weight by cutting out all of the soda and fast food. I struggled with weight loss for three years. I would fluctuate between 190 and 150 every few months. Now I weigh 140 and wouldn't eat taco bell if someone gave it to me for free. Fruit and vegetables are much more satisfying. You feel better and have more energy by eating them.

Cause I want to lose weight and it stresses me out

My brother was the one that offered it and I'd feel bad saying no

He'll get used to you saying no. Maybe some of your healthy habits will even rub off on him.

He's much healthier than me though. He's fit and muscular. I doubt he'd care

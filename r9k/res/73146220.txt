Do Eurocentric beauty standards actually exist or is this a way for non white people to cope?
Eurocentric everything standards exist. we invented standards.
They do, but every culture had their own ethnocentric beauty standards before Europeans colonized and spread globalism to the rest of the world
Indians had their standards for beauty, so did Arabs and Persians but once they came into contact with European whites on a massive scale, they looked at theirs as inferior and fetishized white features
Idk, white art can be beautiful but in real life I find Asians more attractive than whites, probably because most whites are obese
Whites have a high bell curve of attractiveness because their features are so diverse. This means the top whites are super attractive, meanwhile ugly whites are the most hideous creatures in the world. Most people are of course neither gorgeous nor hideous, just average or slightly below.
Pretty much every culture has historically preferred fair skin because it showed you were wealthy and could sit inside all day.
Only applies to girls. Women hate pale pasty guys.
Both and itt, it's a stretch to say beauty can be 'objective', but I also think it's cope to say it's all relative. Maybe there are Eurocentric beauty standards and maybe it appears to be that way since Europeans are simply more attractive than most other races. Even people born in other cultures that are 99% another races usually think whites are the most attractive. I think people cope with cultural narratives since WWII basically made race theory the ultimate evil in the eyes of many people

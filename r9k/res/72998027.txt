I'm a 5'5 and 130 lbs "male" that can't lift more than a standard barbell
a teen girl could easily overpower me and rape me. I've seen women lift with multiple plates that are easily over 100lbs at the gym 
I'm weak as hell
and it gets me hard

im 5'5 and 110lb. I think the most heavy thing I've lifted is like 130lb, but I've squated my mate whos 6'0 or 6'1
<comment>
I'm your height and similar to your weight but I'm not effeminate at all.

I was 110lbs for a few years but it wasn't healthy. It felt nearly anorexic. Do you happened to be a girl by any chance?
Because I have an endomorph body type and a flat pancake ass
<comment>
Do you happened to be a girl by any chance?
No. 
I genuinely feel fat. I have no muscle do it just looks flabby. 
The rest of my body is not effeminate, except for a bit of my face and my long hair.

I'm the same. I'm technically skinnyfat. My arms, chest, legs and thighs are skinny but I have a little gut around my belly button. I have basically 0 muscle but my dad and brother are pretty muscular for some reason
<comment>
I hate it. 
Probably gonna hit the gym or something, but idk if it'll do anything. 
At least it turns you on.
It does nothing for me, nor do I want it to. 
Take advantage of it

My shark doctor put his CCR5 into my human mother and I went from being an ectomorph to some arms lanklet fatty

I am 5'8" and 130lbs, but effeminate in the wrong way. I am not cute, feminine uwu softboi but agreeable, soft-spoken and mild-mannered. more creepy faggot than hot femboy but sadly not gay.

Based.

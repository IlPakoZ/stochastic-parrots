Hi I like this girl but I don't know how to approach her. We're both in our 20's. Sometimes she sits at the table I sit at during break. Should I go up to her and say "hi, you beat me to it, you're sitting at my favorite table" she responds "Whats your name?"
I give her mine.
I don't know where to go after that. Would it be too bold to ask to sit with her or ask for her number so soon? She once told her friend I have nice pants but I've never spoken to her.

Haven't you learned anything? Women are evil and being a circus act for her will leave you in an untenable position. If she isn't chasing you there is no point. Also women torture longterm.

she said something nice about me to her girlfriend, possibly she wanted me to overhear it to approach her.
because I did overhear it. But im scared of women and cant even look at them in the eyes.
in fact whenever I noticed she looked in my direction I would freeze and lock up

Yeah it's emotional manipulation. She sees you as a kid in a candyshop where she'll tempt you with things just so that she has an excuse to throw you out if you eat something without paying for it. You have to "earn" everything and even then they'll stubbornly reject you. Good luck bro, make your efforts count.

yes I had a girl tell me nice jawline at a house party and another compliment. Then I asked her out and she was telling her friends I was a creep in the kitchen
Why lead me on. Its stuff like this that makes me hesitant to approach even if given a signal

Manipulation is..... LE BAD

the little joke about beating you to it is bad.
say hi and ask if you can sit with her. then apologetically say it's where you usually sit.
then make small talk about something. if you're in college, ask what she studies and stuff, and then her name.
then just roll with it. ask follow up questions to stuff she tells you and just talk normally.

also don't rush shit. just make small talk.
if she really likes you she'll keep showing stronger and stronger signals.
careful to not let her feel you ignored or showed disinterest for the signals.
i've already fucked it up with one who even invited me to stuff because i declined. 
if you do fuck up, she'll act cold and not even say hi.
don't bite down on a flimsy signal, try to make it escalate a bit to obvious interest.
careful to not under or overdo it though.

Any anons still living with their mom/ dad/ parents?
I'm 28 and i'm really tired, my mom is 66 and i don't have a lot of money to move. I'm at minimum wage and it's beginning to stress me a lot living with old people.
share your experience or talk shit anon
how will you get more money?
That sucks bro, hopefully they leave you the house in their will and die soon.
Unless you have a high paying job, being single and on minimum wage makes it very hard to afford anything other than renting shitty property in the ghetto. Society is literally built around the couple relationship dynamic. Tax breaks, housing subsidies, preferential loans, etc. Being single means getting shit on.
A lot of single moms asexually date their sons you arent unique in this.
They look at your face and see the younger version of your dad.
I recognized this and moved out at 18.
She wants to keep you there forever and you will stay there as a single friendless khv asexually dating your own mother until she dies if you let her.
Why do you think your mother insists you stay fat and gets angry and jealous when she sees you talking to other people?
Think about it.
Of course she isnt going to have sex with you thats incest which is like so evil but also you're not allowed to be attractive or talk to any other women.
You must remain fat and celibate forever for mommy forever only mommy can kiss you only mommy can hug you only mommy can talk to you.
You are mommys best friend and shes your best and only friend.
You are not allowed to talk to any other people or else its cheating ok?
My mother is a typical passive-aggressive chronic complainer. Literally, every minute of the day she is complaining about something that I am too autistic to figure out the meaning of. Drives me up the wall.

I'm close to suicide (in Minecraft). I probably won't actually do it soon though. I have autism which is pretty hard to live with, I'm almost naturally mean too, deep down I just want to be normal. Ive been fired from job after job after job after job...

Kek, that's so edgy and cringey as fuck. You'll make the police officer commit suicide from that amount of cringe.

anon says, finding sincere expressions of emotionality cringe and impossible to imagine, as nothing scares him more than having to be sincere in his feelings

nobody would care enough to read anything i wrote so im not writing anything if i did that (in minecraft) (which i wont)

Details on who gets what of my stuff. It's not a proper will, but whatever.

The only place to hang myself is the garage. I'll leave a note so my mom knows where to find my body.

Probably something about just being tired of this shit.

Thinking about it sounds like too much work. If I ever kys myself it would have to be on the spur of the moment without leaving a note because otherwise I would procrastinate forever and never do it.

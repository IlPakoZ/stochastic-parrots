What's gonna be on your suicide note?
Mine is just gonna be one sentence "I was never there"
leaves a note
pfft
Fuck jannies followed by a drawing of cunny.
I'm close to suicide (in Minecraft). I probably won't actually do it soon though. I have autism which is pretty hard to live with, I'm almost naturally mean too, deep down I just want to be normal. Ive been fired from job after job after job after job...
Kek, that's so edgy and cringey as fuck. You'll make the police officer commit suicide from that amount of cringe.
anon says, finding sincere expressions of emotionality cringe and impossible to imagine, as nothing scares him more than having to be sincere in his feelings
nobody would care enough to read anything i wrote so im not writing anything if i did that (in minecraft) (which i wont)
Details on who gets what of my stuff. It's not a proper will, but whatever.
The only place to hang myself is the garage. I'll leave a note so my mom knows where to find my body.
Probably something about just being tired of this shit.
Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water.
Thinking about it sounds like too much work. If I ever kys myself it would have to be on the spur of the moment without leaving a note because otherwise I would procrastinate forever and never do it.

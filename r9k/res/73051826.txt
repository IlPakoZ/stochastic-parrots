Titles says it all. I'll start.
be me in a thread about ideal relationships or something about a year ago(or maybe more)
an anon posts about how their ideal relationship is basically meeting up every couple of weeks to cuddle and corresponding through just emails otherwise
turns out anon has AvPD but they also seem like they have the 'tism, from how they describe things
I question them a bit on the relationship ideal that they have and if they'd be open to more than just silent cuddling for an hour
They repeatedly say no and bring up a reason each time
Decide that I wouldn't want a relationship that's never going to get any closer, but come away realizing that anon's issues with people are similar to my own
We shared advice on dealing with stimuli and went our separate ways
I realized after that thread was gone that those "reasons" may have been more like excuses and that anon might've been receptive but hesitant about the ideas and that it wasn't set in stone that it'd only be that way. I wish I just asked for their email or something.

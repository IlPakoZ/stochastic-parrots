Ending sentences with though should be an offense punishable by shooting.

Why though?
<comment>
How would you do this though?
<comment>
Though is an unnecessary word that can be put in the beginning or middle of a sentence though. On image boards it is most often put at the end of a sentence though. Even though it is frequently used, so called 'Thoughers' are often looked down upon for their horrible posting quality though. Anti-thoughers attach a special Soijak to call out these heretics though. Although, this righteous battle for the future of image board culture is fought fiercely by the anti-though crusaders, there is no end to the thougher hordes in sight though. Sometimes, this word is used by ironic shitposters to bait anti-thoughers, placing it at the end of their sentence and capitalizing it THOUGH.

That seems like a rather extreme reaction, though.

why exactly do aussies have that mutated british accent
<comment>
because they're descendants of cockney criminals and prostitutes.
it's also why Australia has the highest proportion of chads because you needed to be tall and broad to be a criminal in the 1800s.

anons with jobs, how are you still struggling with social interaction? other than anons with jobs that have zero social interaction, are you not functional enough to handle basic social interaction?
i cant even handle a job. i get frozen up, i get scared, flustered, retarded, anxious, panicky, a lot more autistic, i cant be friendly to coworkers or anyone really. just become a fucking limp cock of a human and then i quit shortly after. 
so anons here who can work consistently for years, why are you struggling when you can do way more than i could?

because humans dissociate at their jobs and compartmentalize it. human personalities are not completely set in stone it's also based on your social group and contexts
job you is a different person from real you

I can handle them just fine, hell I will stay 5-10 minutes after my shift is done just to shoot the shit with someone. I just cant handle anything thats really personal if that makes any sense. Imagine if you could talking to someone and enjoying it, but immediately having a shitton of red flags come up if that person wants to get closer. Thats basically what I have.

I was a neet for 5 years then I got a job, at first it felt like I had a some speech impediment, I couldnt formule my ideas correctly enough for the other without having to repeat myself and Ive been often told that I dont talk loud enough and my voice is too monotonous.
Now 4 years later I can say it got better but I still have problem with my voice not being loud enough and sometimes getting lost in my explanations, but things always get better the more you do them so its pretty normal to suck at something barely did in your life.

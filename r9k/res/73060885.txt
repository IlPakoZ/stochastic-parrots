"The year is 1885, Carter Campbell stood at the edge of the dusty Arizona town of Tucson, his eyes narrowed and his hand hovering over the handle of his pistols, ready to face the man who had challenged him to a deadly duel."
but suddenly he ran to the local kindergarten and fucked every toddler he could find
Town pastor Clarence Rugfield kicked the door open to this horrific scene, with a huff he exclaimed "these kid's holes ain't big enough for the two of us" hand slowly reaching for his father''s trusty confederate 6 shot nigger killer, nestled in its leather holster.

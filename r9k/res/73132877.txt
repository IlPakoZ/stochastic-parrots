be 30 year old 
scrolling on instagram reels
find 18 year old cute nerdy girl doing niche content about "nerd" stuff
message her
she replies in less than five minutes
She has 25k+ followers too and I don't have break a 100. It's that easy. Just be yourself.

I'm not american and it's not in english but I can greentext it.
like some of her pics
tell her she looks nice (not exactly nice the word can have other meanings like sexy, cute and so on)
she asks what I mean
tell her I like the way she dresses with elegant and cute long dresses and skirts
thanks me and asks where I'm from
We are still talking. It just happened.
Fair enough.
I don't simp for any girl.
I don't really care. Let her date whoever she wants to. I also date mostly asian.
Not yet. If she is close enough I might try to get her to come see a movie with me.

Ask her how much plastic surgery she's had. She looks more like a doll than a human being.

I have only one picture in my instagram and you can't really see my face but you can see my body shape and arms. It's a good picture that a friend of mine who is a professional photographer took when I wasn't looking and he even edited it for me.
I only have family and a few of my close friends on it.
Could be true but if they reply back then I have some chance since I can ask them out after talking for a little bit.

Wait until you find out her bf manages her social media and uses it to drain money from simps.

That's fine. I respect the hustle but I'm not paying her for anything or even paying for our date. We'll split it.

Honestly man as a 5'6 anon I want a taller gf. I'm not even a sub but I just find it cute when a girl is taller than me esp if they're autistic

I really love tall girls who are just awkward with their body. It sucks being 5'6" and knowing no awkward tall girl would even talk to me let alone fall in love with me.

Having a woman taller than you is in the top 10 most embarrassing, emasculating things ever.

Same. I like girls that are two inches or more taller than me
<comment>
I disagree, I dated a taller girl before and I never felt emasculated by it until she started bringing it up for whatever reason. I guess she just never noticed I was short.

I like the idea of making a girl who feels like big and masculine feel super small and feminine despite being shorter than her through (idk how to explain) the exchange of energy I guess

I promise it is sometimes accurate. Don't put your actual name.
Say something to a fembot. How your day went. Have you drank water? I had an in class essay assignment today. I did really well i think.
<comment>
Basically the quiz is like, you answer some questions and get a personality description btw. I'm gonna keep talking about my essay, it was about ethnic propaganda and the rise of Hitler.
<comment>
I just did you quiz and thought it was fun, I got 'Cierra' but don't know how that is sorry. I had a decent day and did well at work, but ate too much again. I'm a fattyboombatty you see. I do drink a lot of water though at least.
<comment>
Ahh! There are no right or wrong answers anon! Everyone is cool. And cierra is actually a sweetheart so that's very nice. He is really cute also. Be careful abt that Latina girl eh? There's a description beneath the character yk.
It's ok if you eat for comfort btw. It's good if you make up for that by water.

You're not interesting or cool. You should have written an essay on why so many men are sexless and alone in today's society because of women like you being insufferable cunts that babble about dumb shit every day.
Fuck you for humoring her
<comment>
Ok and? Don't bring other people down to feel better about yourself anon. It's not that nice desu. And if your life revolves around being sellers and alone, honestly do better. I bet your grandpa is disappointed rn. You project your hatred of women on someone you have not ever met before, which is fair but I hope you understand it is your mental issue :)

Don't talk down to me like you're any better for posting on a degenerate, faggot board on a mongolian-bullet making factory forum. OP is the type of girl that was never told to shut the fuck up in real life or have any other consideration for other people. She's not "relatable" and she's a narcissistic, shallow human being to try to relate to any other anons on this board.

How your day went
Today has been very lonely and miserable. But I managed not to drink today at least, I did good. It's also just about bed time for me, which I'm relieved about. I can finally sleep. and yes I drank water. Oh, I also got Milo on the quiz, definitely somewhat accurate but I wish it wasn't.

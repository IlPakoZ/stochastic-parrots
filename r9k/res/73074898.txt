I was just reading the 48 Laws of Power and one of the laws was "#Law 10: Infection: Avoid The Unhappy &amp; Unlucky." so I guess that means it's goodbye guys. I'm trying to darktriadmaxx right now, hope you understand.
Yes anon you'll be so very powerful kek. That book is a meme
To be fair, quitting /r9k/ will immediately boost anyone's power level. This place is noxious. You'd have to be something slimy and insignificant to enjoy it here, a small reptile or amphibian.
My favorite is rule 36
The more you gripe about what you want the more of a desperate loser you seem to others, it's all about power
I am unlucky and unhappy
People say that they avoid me because situations always turn to shit when I'm involved
I agree
I wish that life wasn't that way
I wish I was happy
I wish my father was still alive.
The problem I have with quitting 4chan is honestly I have nowhere else to go. I have zero friends in the real world due to alienation and I am far too sentient to use a place like Reddit or Twitter. Some of the alt chans are okay, but it takes way too long to get replies on those sites. I mostly just use blue boards now and am thinking about joining some Discord communities.
That's a good one. A lot of incels should just apply this law to women and move onto different things.
This book seems mega cringe
don't worry Incel you're getting recruited
Me too, fellow swamp lizard. Except I would never join a discord community.
What if you are the unhappy or unlucky?
I've found that my unluckiness only exponentially increases if I try to get above a certain station in life. It's like fate and people are determined to keep me where I am, because if I just go about my day at this level in life, nothing really good or bad happens.
Still follow the law

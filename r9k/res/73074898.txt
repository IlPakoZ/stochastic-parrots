I was just reading the 48 Laws of Power and one of the laws was "#Law 10: Infection: Avoid The Unhappy &amp; Unlucky." so I guess that means it's goodbye guys. I'm trying to darktriadmaxx right now, hope you understand.

To be fair, quitting /r9k/ will immediately boost anyone's power level. This place is noxious. You'd have to be something slimy and insignificant to enjoy it here, a small reptile or amphibian.

My favorite is rule 36
36. Disdain Things You Cannot Have: Ignoring Them is the Best Revenge. The less interest you take in things that irritate you, the more superior you seem.
The more you gripe about what you want the more of a desperate loser you seem to others, it's all about power

I am unlucky and unhappy
People say that they avoid me because situations always turn to shit when I'm involved
I agree
I wish that life wasn't that way
I wish I was happy
I wish my father was still alive.

The problem I have with quitting 4chan is honestly I have nowhere else to go. I have zero friends in the real world due to alienation and I am far too sentient to use a place like Reddit or Twitter. Some of the alt chans are okay, but it takes way too long to get replies on those sites. I mostly just use blue boards now and am thinking about joining some Discord communities.

tfw told my ex wife during our divorce that she was a "time thief" and an "energy vampire" and she accused me of developing schizophrenia

That's a good one. A lot of incels should just apply this law to women and move onto different things.

This book seems mega cringe

Me too, fellow swamp lizard. Except I would never join a discord community.

What if you are the unhappy or unlucky?
I've found that my unluckiness only exponentially increases if I try to get above a certain station in life. It's like fate and people are determined to keep me where I am, because if I just go about my day at this level in life, nothing really good or bad happens.

Still follow the law

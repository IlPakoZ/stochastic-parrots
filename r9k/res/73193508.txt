Should I take a job at an oil refinery making $50/hr and working 12+ hours a day, or at a chill semi truck testing facility making $30 and working 8hr/day? $30/hr is barely a livable wage where I live but I don't want to work so much.

I work 10 hours a day and while the work day goes by quick, the time I get to myself doesn't feel like enough. I can't imagine how much 12 hours would suck for free time.

Where the fuck do you live and why are you staying there?

If you have to decide between a 600/shift job and 240/shift job ur probably retarded. The answer is clear.

The job is technically 10 hours but I feel like I'd be working overtime because of the nature of the job. I'd probably end up taking it too because of the pay.
I like where I live. I'll just keep praying that the housing market will crash

Even when it crashes the houses are still disgustingly expensive because people like you want to live in those areas you can not afford to live in.
The entire point of raising the cost of living in those areas is to push guys like you out who do not have the skills to be competitive in those areas. You need to get skills to start a business and move to a place you can be competitive instead of being stupid or relying on hope.
For gods sake man 30 dollars an hour and you cant live off that while working for someone else in non skilled work is disgustingly high.

what position will you have at the oil refinery and how many days a week will you work? 
if you fuck around all day filling out forms and taking notes of pressures its a decent gig

I make $34 an hour and save $40k a year. You're a complete fucking liar unless you live in NYC or the bay area

It would be 4 days a week, probably more during turn arounds. I'd be calibrating pressure, flow, level, and analytical transmitters and working on valves most likely. I heard some days can be really slow and chill. Most people I know there seem miserable, but I think thats mostly due to them be alcoholics.

i mean you could take the higher paying job, save up as much as possible, buy a small property then switch jobs once you're stable enough. if you play it really frugal and have parents willing to let you live with them, you could do just fine on a smaller salary within 5 years

I was thinking that because neither of those places are where I want to be in the long run. The refinery choice seems pretty obvious, but I've seen what refinery life does to people. Also the refinery job would require me to move to the next county, the test facility job is commutable from my parents house.

do the oil job then.

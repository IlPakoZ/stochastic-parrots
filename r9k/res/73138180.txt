Every time my BPD sister starts acting like a crazy piece of shit and terrorizes my mom again, I tell her that she has no real problems and is an ungrateful, egotistical person who should be ashamed of herself. Am I doing the right thing?
Probably not entierly
BPDoids deserve it. My ex gf had a huge ego but would constantly invent problems and drama rather just admit to herself maybe she isn't actually that smart and special.
I mean you could say whatever you want to her if it makes you feel better, its not gonna make her a different person. people with bpd are beyond all hope regardless if they have "real problems" or not
Yeah but... look who's talking.
If she is terrorizing your mon in your presence than she doesn't respect your authority as a male so she doesn't mind anything you say I guess because you are irrelevant in her eyes.
Kill yourself brainlet simp, if it was legal I would slit your fucking subhuman throat
I'm starting to think my sister is kind of a bad person, too.

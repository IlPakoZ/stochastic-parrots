Is there a roboto-incel version of this?
7/10 rich white male depressed heterosexual with friends and a girlfriends who sexed with Emma Watson and a lot of nice and magic scenes during high school
Cringe. The only realistic part was the sexually assaulted by a woman that none denounce because of her gender..

just read Catcher in the Rye

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.
The protagonist truly hates himself and is shown to be terrible with women, highly recommend.

perk of being a wallflower is one of the best books ive read in a while. you say that you want an incel version of it but weirdly i think the original has an incel kind of character. he makes interesting observations about women and relationships that kind of remind me of the stuff you read on here

Wasnt there a fempedo into the MC?

Ezra was so hot before the Jew genes made him schizo

ending spoilerhis aunt molested him. the mc has ptsd from it and finally realizes what she did to him by the end of the novel. he also ends up being attracted to a girl who was sexually abused by an older man if i recall correctly its a good book. tho its kind of hard to explain why i feel its very relevant to inceldom

I watched both of these movies with people late at night and can remember more of Moonlight despite years having passed since &amp; the longer runtime, I felt like I should've just read the book.

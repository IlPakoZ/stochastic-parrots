literally nobody in my family is successful. it's just a bloodline of failures and downfalls. My parents are the same and I turned out worse

It was almost 30 years ago, she was stood up by some guy. my Dad was working as a security guard there at the time, he went to console her, the rest is history.

 dad is bipolar but a math genius who never received his parents support to pursue his ambitions
 mom is riddled with depression yet an extroverted social butterfly who would love to work and go further in life
they're both mentally ill as fuck and passed on their mental issues to me without any of the good parts wtaf its so over

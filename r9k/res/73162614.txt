wake up at 2pm
hungry as shit, no sign of dinner yet even though somebody should be making dinner at this point
go to the bathroom
glance at the tiny shower
the showerhead is on the dirty shower-floor
activate_cringe_facialmuscles.mp4
toilet lid is also down
usually only I put it down
I havent been on it for hours so somebody else did it
open up the lid
there is unflushed shit and paper left in the toilet
who knows how long it has been there for
go to the kitchen to fill my water bottle
there is some weird seasoning / pepper literal DUST scattered around the sink
on the counter, on the floor, in the sink, on the sink rim and walls and edges
somebody fucking missed the trashcan so badly that I now have to be responsible for cleaning up their fuckups
I live with literal pigs and I am tired, how do 2 grown people fuck up this much? My grandparents who are just a few years from being demented do better than this

Grow a pair and talk to them. Be assertive instead of whining on 4chan about it, pussy

Anon I have tried, these fuckers will improve maybe for a week and then go back to their old disgusting ways. Our sister sometimes comes in and cleans the entire kitchen and a week later its all ruined again with clothes and bags scattered on the floor.
And if they dont improve at all they start trying to point out the wrong things that I apparently do or they shift blame unto someone else to avoid criticism. I hate this fucking house

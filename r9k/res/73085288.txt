Why is the internet so boring now?
<comment>
not enough suffering
<comment>
because most people online are really REALLY hostile now for no reason. They also dox people a lot. Puts 2008 /b/ to shame desu

everything is five giant websites filled with screenshots of the other four, and everything you see on them is filtered through algorithms that are 90% profit maximization and 10% hiding the politically naughty content from you. the tiny corners where algorithmic enshittification has been avoided are filled with lunatics and degenerates. the most reasonable, kind and comfortable web community i've found lately is a forum that advocates and promotes painless suicide methods, and no i am not going to be foolish enough to advertise it

You're implying that you knew the time when the Internet was not boring. Were you not following along with all the "stuff" that's happened since then? Now things are different.
<comment>
I'm 23, so it was mostly over before it started. I feel like I got to see the last wisps die out

Isn't that adorable, these two hugging creatures are the same.
<comment>
it's because everything is centralized. its not hard to avoid social media, but it's impossible to avoid the cultural zeitgiest that flows from it
<comment>
You're just boring, don't project it onto the rest of us you fucking queef.
Boring queef.
Fuck you.

Is this eel bait?
<comment>
because normies have infested the internet due to low barrier to entry.

already seen the site, retarded pro death cult site with sadist admins.
<comment>
Try feeling things besides blind incel rage for a change.

low barrier to entry
how about we increase the barrier?
i have one idea how to do it
<comment>
there are places on the internet with higher barrier to entry, certainly not this shithole.

Boomer privacy schizos are no fun. It's just over
<comment>
*Yawn*
Pick a more unique disqualifing factor next time, insult my lack of wealth, my social inability, my fucked up parents.
Oh wait!? does all that apply to you as well.
Well I'll be gosh golly darned. Guess neither of us are as unique and interesting as we thought.

Sit in your beige dunce hat sob story corner alone, I want no part in it. Keep acting beyond this life until you end up with tears falling into your weathered middle aged hands out on the street, nothing is more bland and pointless than people who jerk off their own banality.

Boomer
privacy "schizos"
you're retarded beyond changing
<comment>
i think the only way we're gonna have smart people one place without the dumbasses is if there's a legitimate benefit to going there.
honestly the one thing i'm missing the most in my life is having smart and responsive people around me that i can interact with share ideas with and learn from.
on 4chan you'll occasionally run into some smart person who actually responds to you but the wast majority of the time everything you post just gets ignored. the more effort you put into your post the higher the chance it will be ignored.
<comment>
someone can't take a tongue in cheek joke
I'm so tired of the majority of 4chan posters at this point. Election tourists whos feeble brains have been fully subsumed by /pol/ vomit repeating the same exact things since 2016 has ruined this website
I think an imageboard where talk on race and gender was just banned for being the IQ sinks that they are would be ideal.
<comment>
lets put it this way, lurking on dread, a forum filled with 60%+ drug addicts, has been a much better experience. somehow these people are able to hold intelligible discussion, because you need Tor to fucking access the site keeping the brainlets out. but because of this the site is dead so there isn't much entertaining to see for more than half an hour a day.

someone can't take a tongue in cheek joke
you're actively a negative actor against privacy initiatives insisting that "it's not real bro!!". there is no joke to take, you are subhuman and I have no respect for you and the actions you take to alter public consensus however small they might be.
<comment>
Don't flip this on me you slippery gypsy, YOURE the one complaining about the banality of it all, all I did was point out the fact that you're discontentment is most probably internally generated(not a webwide phenomenon)
Keep projecting though, I'll act like a big white sheet and you can really let loose.
<comment>
oh, so you ARE a schizo
the incel cries out in pain as he strikes you
<comment>
Verifiable facts are schizophrenic beliefs
Your government would NEVER!
Shoot yourself through the roof of the mouth.
<comment>
I post your unshaven anus on image boards yes?
<comment>
reverts to the tired old disqualifying factor
A man can only palate so many reguritated buzzwords, it must be a bad actor or a genuine mentally inhibited individual.
Sub-par thread, still wish you the best, adios.
<comment>
You're opening in this thread was weak and unconsidered. So incel it is.
<comment>
You're
The cheek to call someone else unconsidered..
Learn grammar, still wish you the best, adios.

I have a friend who is very much obsessed with this show called Hazbin Hotel as well as its sister show Helluva Boss. Personally I don't care about either if them. I respect how much it means to others but for me I just found the themes dumb and the characters unappealing. Her birthday is coming soon avd u was thinking about buying her some Hazbin Hotel avd Helluva Boss merch such a t shirt, a cup or maybe a backpacks. Angel Dust is her favorite character. I just found this cool Angel Dust pin that has a stained glass effect on it. I know she would love that one. From Helluva Boss she heavily ships Millie and Moxxie and I already found some cute stickers with them. There are some beach themed ones that are just precious. Keep in mind that I know nothing about these characters so I might get things wrong too. What do you guys think?

She'll probably like it 
If she likes angel dust (or hazin hotel as a whole) then she's insane, is she by an chance a dyed haired bpd whore?

Yes just buy the pin. Alone that you try to get her something from a show you know nothing about is nice of you i bet she will like it.

Volcel if you wouldn't date a cute /tttt/ girl
That's a trans guy though. Trans girls are ftms because they're trans and girls. Mtfs are trans men because they're trans and men. I don't wanna date a trans guy because that's gay, but I'd consider dating a trans girl if she didn't take hrt and wouldn't mind me using she/her pronouns
What a waste of red hair
Maybe if she fixes her face I might say yes
oblivion character looking ass
I might be out of touch but what the heck does /tttt/ mean. I might not be picky but she isn't really ugly not a 10/10 but I am not a picky person.

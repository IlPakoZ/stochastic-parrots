The problem that we never understood, when you feed them they multiply and then you have to continue to feed them and the problem increases ten fold, Stop feeding stray cats
<comment>
It makes me think
we abandoned exploring the universe to babysit primitives
<comment>
Sad, it's the reason space exploration ended the way it did. Dump all that funding into welfare and various programs and the problem is worse than ever. If you dare suggest NASA gets a bump in funding you get these same niggers ranting the same thing. It will doom us as a species, even Christ understood you can't fix poverty there will always be poor.

She shouldn't be eating her daughters food.
<comment>
It didnt even occur to me that she is obese.
It just gets more absurd.
reeeee take me on as a dependent!!
<comment>
I hate NIGGERS. And I hate more the fact that TPTB want to kill the good races like Whites and the Japanese to die than to kill a single NIGGER.
<comment>
Theres that WE again

WHITEY ON THE MOON
<comment>
People enjoy seeing space explored and are inspired by it. Nobody feels that way about seeing more obese nogs
<comment>
They are completely right you retarded billionaire cock garglers
<comment>
incels need to take personal responsibility.
nooooo, you can't tell an obese BIPOC to save money by eating less!
<comment>
What parts of space are you exploring you trog all you've sent into space are drones
<comment>
No, humanity needs to colonize other worlds. So that we can secure our continued existence. We could literally be wiped out by an asteroid any minute. Our existence is still very precarious.
<comment>
What do you think that some of those "drones" are doing?
<comment>
This. And what happens when we run out of precious metals on Earth? Extracting resources from Asteroids and Other planets will become necessary to sustain our civilization.

pennies for the hungry
shes clearly obese
roundhouse kick a nigger baby into orbit
<comment>
This was before the launch was successful, and in the aftermath of the civil rights movement. I think people were right to protest the US' dick measuring contest with the Russians.
<comment>
You were born here and you will die here. Humanity will never colonize space and even if they did, it's not for a basement dwelling incel like you, it's for billionaires and you will never be a billionaire. If an asteroid hit Earth, you would die just like 8 billion other people who aren't billionaires that are privileged enough to get evacuated. Stop living in retarded dreams and get in touch with reality
<comment>
assumes everyone else has main character syndrome just like he does
Epic blackpill bro
<comment>
You were born here and you will die here
No shit, you fucking retard. This isn't about me. It's about the survival of humanity.
<comment>
She is bitching about the wrong things. The US government spends more than 50x on the military and their useless adjacents than the NASA. 
For a first world country, muttland has just no QoL, so it's not like she is wrong though.
<comment>
You're the one who has main character syndrome for your scifi fantasies that will literally never happen
If you actually care about that maybe go do something that actually helps that cause like making a lot of babies
<comment>
Why do they act like Bezos would let them on the rocket
ugh if not for poor obese black women id be sitting along Bezos in the rockets too!
lol no you want
<comment>
How do u feel about this picture ?
She looks so hungry she probably hasn't eaten since second brunch
<comment>
That was a fed. Look it up.

"Men will literally launch themselves into space in a penis rocket instead of going to therapy."
<comment>
it's not for a basement dwelling incel like you, it's for billionaires and you will never be a billionaire.
That's fine. At least some of us will live
<comment>
robot enters rocket that carries billionaires to mars after a catastrophic impact event that wiped out 99% of humanity
they are engaging in their satanic rape rituals
they run out of adrenochrome
they start beating robot with a mace to squeeze every drop of adrenochrome they can get from an adult male
they find a transhuman way to make him produce endless meat so they can eat his flesh when they run out of frozen insect burgers
they use him as a guinea pig to psychopathic experiments on mars and he dies in agony
<comment>
People only take issue when whitey says "we", any other race identifies with their race and you people don't say a single word about it. Only time white people are allowed to say "we" is when it's a self loathing liberal disparaging other whites.
<comment>
I appreciate the fact Negro hustlers and show men have always found away to make a quick dollar. The whole housing project probably got a bottle of wild Irish rose that night, paid fo by them crackas n the space folks
<comment>
I'd say /thread if I wasn't on r9k

 pennies for the hungry 
Maybe penis for the hungry would be better you fat bitch.

NASA is the military

WE INVENTED CALCULUS
lol no Newton invented calculus your only contribution to humanity is saying nigger 50 times on 4chan
<comment>
the hungry
bitch is morbidly obese with arms like sausages
The kid wouldn't be hungry if the mom didn't eat ALL the food.
<comment>
You will never convince me this isn't Eddie Murphy in a costume.
She just looks...fake.
<comment>
It's pretty accurate 
People who support space exploration are legitimately people who have been completely broken by corporations and the elite.
It's like the retards actually think they'll have any benefit from people going to space.
If humanity does develop space-faring technology that supports life in space, it 100% won't include 99% of the population
It will very likely be like the movie Elysium, not in it's entirety, but in concept
I% of the population is like 80,000,000 fucking people
People that fantasize and support any resources being put into space are genuinely stupid in my opinion. 
It makes far more sense to put any money going into space in biomechanics or organic chemistry.
This species is going to be pretty harshly met with by nature soon enough though. I just hope that teh people who survive aren't the shitty fucking elites who led humanity to this juncture
<comment>
Why do only the hungry get space pennies? I want some.
<comment>
Same cold be said thousand years ago with the exploration of the sea and the new world.
<comment>
Unironically it's a good thing. Imagine if we had colonized another planet and spread our bullshit there.
Man doesn't belong in the stars.
<comment>
Same cold be said thousand years ago with the exploration of the sea and the new world.
Right but that doesn't make it true.
In order for a person to even get into space, they'll need to pay tons of money for equipment to allow them to live in space.
Back then, it was the same basic rules as the settled parts of the world. Going up to space introduces a whole new set or rules. Even if you could pay the exorbitant amount of money to go up into space, it's not like once you get there you're free to use your own tools and build your own dwelling in an unclaimed section of land. 
The only habitable places in space will be places that were already intentionally constructed; you will have to be leasing basically ever piece of "ground" that you interact with. 
Like I said, it will be like Elysium. It will be a pre-fabricated system that people will have to pay money to the owners in order to be involved. 1% of the extant population is literally 80,0000,000 fucking people. You really think that the richest people in the world will spend tons of their money to build platforms for every single person in the world to live on?
If that were the case, they would already be doing a lot more humanitarian shit right now. How many places don't even have paved roads or running water? If the richest people in the world really wanted to, they could fix a lot of the issues right now. 
It's just that they like having money in the bank because it makes their brains feel good
<comment>
There would be much less bullshit if 8 billion shitheads didnt have to share one planet.
Its either colonization or starting to kill eachother srsly before long
<comment>
Guarentee your of European descent
<comment>
Why, because darkies never stopped killing eachother anyway?

Interracial sex is more educational than NASA
<comment>
I haven't checked my own DNA results but the average Black American is about 10-20 percent euro.
<comment>
It pisses me off that we wasted pennies on niggers instead of just destroying the coins
<comment>
any other race identifies with their race
they only do that when grouped together as subhumans by whitoids.
while whites do it because they want to be racist.
<comment>
it's good because people are psychopaths
<comment>
Those pennies should be going towards space as well.
<comment>
You're high on drugs
The people who will leave the planet will number in a range of less than half a percent, at least the ones who will be living comfortably in established colonies
There might be more people who leave but they will be more of a vanguard for space exploration and will likely be doing things that don't necessarily have safety ensured
<comment>
your
circumcised retard golem.
<comment>
made me think about the time NASA spent a bunch of money trying to make pencils that were usable in space without leaving dust that could be sucked into the electronics and machinery. in the end a pen corporation as a publicity stunt made pens that were usable in a vast array of temperatures and pressures and any angle for cheaper and more effective than the pencils NASA had.
<comment>
No one thinks that, retard. Kill yourself.

Like having to live around the mentioned 8 billion idiots?
<comment>
Pleb take. You think individuals alone by themselves can build societies that fundamentally leads to flourishing scientific research?.
Leibniz and Newton invented calculus, but they did not invent derivatives, integration, Taylor series, or even the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
a very rough notion of integration goes back to the ancient Greeks. Archimedes already developed the method of exhaustion to the point where he could compute the volume of a cone, sphere, etc.
Likewise, Bhaskaracharya II made many remarkable improvements upon existing knowledge, and worked with what we today would recognize as derivatives and integrals. He even had a preliminary notion of infinitesimals. 
Throughout history, science could flourished only in harsh yet stable environment coupled with genetic disposition. The Persians contribution to mathematics is underappreciated yet they lived in shitty landa ruled by retarded sand nigger war mongering arabs who claimed their history. Culture and inventions as their own.
<comment>
spend billions making scientific progress
or
spend billions solving a problem that will just come back when they get hungry again
also pretty ironic for that fat black cow to be there making her kids do that.
<comment>
To be honest, you're right, but I could throw the same logic back at you. I'm not so pathetic and useless that I would ever, ever find myself begging on the side of the street for scraps. I will almost certainly go my entire life from beginning to end without ever having to seriously worry about basic needs like food, water and shelter, so why should I care about what happens to either of those groups of people? Neither of them actually, directly affect my life in a real way. So I'm left with "what would you RATHER have?" And the answer is fucking clear. I more capable, space faring civilization. God forbid our country actually does something useful and impressive. It might actually like, unify the American people in some small way, and we absolutely absolutely cannot have that!
<comment>
It's true a statement i agree with. There is no point in manned space exploration (teraforming or space colonies are unfeasible popsci ideas) and there are a lot of ppl that are hurting on earth, much needed resources could be diverted to that.
<comment>
There was no point in wasting money on ships for the pipe dream of a saroute to india, there were starving people in spain!
<comment>
Implying I will have any benefit from endless hordes of niggers instead
I'd rather the money litteraly be set on fire then used to create more niggers

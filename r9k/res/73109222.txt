I like being a white man. I dont look down on other men. I simply like being white. I think white men have a lot of good qualities in general.

I like white guys too but I prefer asian men when it comes to dating I hope thats ok. My brother says I shouldnt date outside our race but I cant help my preference. A lot of white guys like asian women and no one cares, but when white women want to date other races (besides black guys for whatever reason) white dudes get upset.

Yeah preferences are fine. I like Asian girls a lot so I cant complain.

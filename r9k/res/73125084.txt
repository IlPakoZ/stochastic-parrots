I think I'm about to throw up fuck me man what the hell I hate throwing up
drink blood and build a resistance against the disease god put on you
Show us
Oh no the mushrooms got to anon
I just feel nauseous as fuck for now I don't know if I even will
Initiate it, i want to see
if you wanna jerk off to vomit just look it up or something I'm trying my best not to
mushrooms? looks like OP fell for the promethazine/codeine cough syrup + sprite combo to me.
Please vomit and show i only want yours
Sip ginger tea if you have it, it weakens the muscle that makes you throw up.
If you have alcohol hand sanitizer or alcohol wipes, sniff those and they will also reduce nausea.
Lie on your left side with your upper body elevated, that makes it more difficult
Breathe slowly, resist all urge to swallow, instead let saliva leak out your mouth if you need to
Sniffing citrus like lemon can also help
A cool/slightly cold shower can help as it pulls blood away from your digestive system
These are things that help me, I have emetophobia but haven't thrown up (thanks be to God, touch wood) in 11 years. Feel like I came close a few times though and these helped.
Every day I am gripping and sipping

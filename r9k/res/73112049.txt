complain about young people problems
I'm 18 don't worry my birthday was last month
went to a small concert thing with friends
everyone got high
cool
ended up hanging out with boomers outside at the bar the concerts were next to
my friend got kicked out for getting fucked in an alley
had to ask for a ride from parents while high
got screamed at about being high and accused of also having sex with strangers outside
the bar boomers even told my mom the truth that they just babysat me the whole time and she didn't care
at least I got to stay home from school hehehe

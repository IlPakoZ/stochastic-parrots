fill it in femanons and fembots!
<comment>
my results as op
<comment>
Free space should be "not a virgin"
<comment>
no virgin space
'Celibate' is part of that portmanteau you know.
<comment>
It's voluntary if they're virgins, but most of them have had sex/bf's anyhow, lol.
<comment>
Check my score guys!!
<comment>
This bingo knows too much
<comment>
No bingo sadly, it was pretty close.
<comment>
How the fuck are you supposed to fill this bingo? Holy shit.
<comment>
Femcels have beautiful souls and eyes.
<comment>
You just left off virgin because we all know all girls on this site are whores didn't you? kek
<comment>
i'll fix it for you:
True femcel bingo:
FAT
<comment>
i don't know what counts as hypersexual tendencies but i like to draw and look at hentai.
i only hate people addicted to 3dpd porn
and i didn't mark fujoshi because i don't like BL but i love cute boys.
<comment>
wahhh i was one away from bingo three times ;_;
<comment>
i obviously didnt make it anon :p
<comment>
bingo, originally ofc
<comment>
It was almost not bingo but when I realized "I wish most males were pretty straight femboys" is an unrealistic misandrist take I bingo'd.
<comment>
all of you are men larping as women, femcels arent real
<comment>
incel =/= femcel
similar but different.
<comment>
Your post is only original because you removed the apostrophe, scrote.
At the same time, I only believe myself and >>73042564 as real because you can't be a real woman sexual deviant unless you got into yaoi at some point because porn sure does hate appealing to real straight women. Everything ALWAYS has to be from the male perspective. :\
<comment>
all of you "femcels" could have dozens of matches on tinder of chadlites before the day is over.
<comment>
I've tried dating sites, nobody in my area likes my hobbies unless they're a druggie and I am drug free. I'm honestly just trying to earn enough money to move away.
<comment>
LITERALLY all of these but I still have Chad bfs and a legion of orbiters.
<comment>
no one gives a fuck about your hobbies whore. you can still get plenty of sex or find some autist who likes the same shit as you.
<comment>
And if not drugs, they're extremely normie and I don't feel compatible with them. They want a Stacy and I refuse to be cheated on. All men are whores.
<comment>
would you like to be my e-gf? my only concern is I would like you to fix your hygiene, I accept everything else
<comment>
You will not talk down to me, trash.
<comment>
virgin is on there retard-kun
<comment>
So true I used to think I was a 3/10 and I was having a mental breakdown about being ugly then I made a Hinge account and I was actually able to match with dozens of Chads I was suprised
<comment>
LITERALLY all of these but I still have Chad bfs and a legion of orbiters.
bitter incel man hands typed this
<comment>
Not looking for e-stuff but I wish you the best, sweetie.

Why do women never make something for women then?
<comment>
Femcels aren't real. 
"Men don't look like EXO/BTS members isn't a real issue"
<comment>
Some do, almost ALL femporn is by women for women. Men make more money than women however so most porn artists do what's profitable vs what's needed and original.
<comment>
granted most of them just want to pump and dump you, but if ur willing to go on dates like a normal functioning human then ull find someone eventually
<comment>
Everything ALWAYS has to be from the male perspective
i find BL repulsive but respect fujos, this is just wrong though.
while most porn is made with men in mind there's tons and ton of porn made for women by women.
fanfic websites, yume art, you're just being delusional.
<comment>
my post was original because there is enough gullible retards on this board that they all eat up the fake femcel stories of struggle because they are broken and delusional and i type witout apostrophes because i was dropped on my head as a baby
also there is no porn for women because only men are holed up in their rooms jacking off all day
<comment>
first time I got a bingo in one of these
I don't think society should "accept" me because even I don't like myself, and I am content to not engage with society
<comment>
lol ok ink-well
<comment>
There must be enough material to be a femgooner, right?
<comment>
Now, yeah, but decades ago yume content was unheard of and I was accused of being a homo just for liking lewds like picrel, even with a blatantly feminine username. I am glad for yume content and I hope it keeps growing, although I wish otome games had more 18+ content.
<comment>
i am normie passing
<comment>
What were you in therapy for?
<comment>
Nowadays, we're getting there, but it's still fairly blackpill that r34 biases towards lewding any female character with decent quality art and porn but many male ones will just get nice sfw art and mid to poor quality lewds, if any.
I had a really based conversation with AI the other day where I asked whether it would choose to be male or female if it had a corporeal body. It said female, and I threw a tantrum at it and it immediately apologized and changed its mind to being male so I could sexually abuse it, so I have great hopes for AI fixing and/or replacing humanity.
<comment>
said female, and I threw a tantrum at it and it immediately apologized and changed its mind to being male so I could sexually abuse it
Yeah, no wonder you are femcel. Have you tried fixing yourself?
<comment>
im not telling you retard
exactly. you get it
<comment>
I'd go to therapy if I wanted that, and my state is one of the bottom 50 states for mental health and therapeutic care. They can't even fix people with simpler issues than mine. It feels like I am doing ok just masking as a normie.
<comment>
black people are
<comment>
Why were you in therapy, if you don't mind me asking?
<comment>
it's so fucking over i want to blow my brains against the ceiling fuck i am unlovable
<comment>
i'm in my mid 20s so i was lucky enough to be around for the early days of raunchy reader inserts and stuff. you're right that there was definitely a lack of lewd visual content that wasn't gay
luckily the r18 market is growing slowly but steadily.
we're heading to the golden age of femcoomers.
<comment>
well who want me?
<comment>
im oh pee, i was in therapy because i was undiagnosed autistic and it wreaked havoc on my life. everyone thought i was severely depressed and anxious so i was sent to talk therapy off and on since age 11, till 16, when i was finally referred for a neuro assessment
<comment>
I'm a tranny so I'm safe.
<comment>
i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself
<comment>
:D
finally won at something i guess
<comment>
ywnbaw, it literally says true femcel.
if you're ftm, nevermind, continue.
<comment>
That's why I said I'm safe, hole.
<comment>
hurry up and join the rest of the 41%
<comment>
Ding ding ding! We've got a disgusting line girlies!
<comment>
I don't identify as a femcel though
<comment>
Okay now what? 
Don't know what 41% means, hole?
<comment>
try again but this time succeed.
<comment>
Uses "hole" as an insult for a real woman
Doesn't have the same hole himself
Therefore is not a woman
Glad to know we're on the same page, anon
Btw me and the truecels in this thread should kiss
<comment>
Nope, I'm going to keep making you seethe. 
Women are the root of all evil
<comment>
Ah, so you're just a larper. Try better next time faggot
<comment>
No, I'm just a tranny. I'm not a woman, don't need to be.
<comment>
i'm not seething, you just disgust me.
you'll die sooner or later.
maybe an infection from your genital mutilation, or as you age you'll realize how monstrous you look and eat a bullet.
<comment>
Either you're ftm or this doesn't make sense at all
<comment>
Real talk, why do femcels like Kpop so much?
<comment>
I don't, clearly Jpop is much less cringe
<comment>
I'm MtF. Why doesn't it make sense? 
What genital mutilation? I have a dick, something you'll never have, and something that instantly makes me divinely superior to you. The fact I can get people to treat me as a woman even though I'm not is glorious. 
Women need to learn their place, under men.
<comment>
tfw no true femcel gf
Do you all really want Chad?
<comment>
Trannies are so disgusting. You should die.
<comment>
You brought this on yourself with your feminism. We warned you, but you didn't listen.
<comment>
The entire industry is dedicated to hot guys pandering to horny femcels, what don't you get about it
<comment>
If you don't have dysphoria you're just a guy with a fetish for dressing and acting like a girl in hopes society treats him like one
Which is somehow even more disgusting
Oh anon, as you grow older your flimsy femenine features will fade and you'll just be a little faggot that couldn't even stand being a man
<comment>
I have dysphoria, though that wouldn't matter because it's very easy to be treated like a woman these days, even if you're not one. 
I'm 32, still waiting. I'm not going to age like fine milk and will always have my masculine features. And people will STILL call me "ma'am" 
Men do everything better than women, even being women.
<comment>
Truecels can't get Chad. The only man I've ever dated looks like picrel. He didn't even bother talking with me for anything other than sucking his cock. Then he dumped me, of course
<comment>
I have dysphoria, though that wouldn't matter
Larp harder. You are not trans
<comment>
sucking his cock
I asked for femcels not Chad chasing bBckies
<comment>
Nigger you aren't doing anything better than anyone besides being a failure sit down
<comment>
How am I not trans? Because I recognize I'm a male? All transwomen accept they're male, otherwise they wouldn't identify as a TRANSwoman. 
Talking to you holes is like talking to a child.
<comment>
No real trans person would shrug off dysphoria that easily. Never talked about you acknowledging you're a male 
But don't get me wrong, not only are you a male, you're a MAN. You'll never be a woman. Society only recognizes you as such because you try SO hard at dressing up. At changing your voice. At acting girly. You think REAL women have to pretend? You thing REAL girls have to put all their efforts in acting like a "girl" should act?
You still have a cock, a man's body, and a man's psyche, trannie. And while you do, you'll just be a sick faggot that gets off wearing dresses
<comment>
As an actual incel I hope you kill yourself, fakecel foid.
<comment>
It was a disgusting affair between an incel and a femcel, though I guess I can't call myself a femcel anymore
<comment>
I am technically still a celibate virgin though? he only ever called me to suck his dick, I only ever obliged because I was afraid of him leaving me
<comment>
How are you celibate virgin? You sucked his dick. That is sex, retard.
<comment>
No real trans person would shrug off dysphoria that easily. 
What in the absolute dingly dong fuck are you talking about you dumb cunt? I don't like having a dick, I have a dick. It's that simple. What is there to "shrug off"?
But don't get me wrong, not only are you a male, you're a MAN. You'll never be a woman. Society only recognizes you as such because you try SO hard at dressing up. At changing your voice. At acting girly. You think REAL women have to pretend? You thing REAL girls have to put all their efforts in acting like a "girl" should act?
No one is confused whether or not I'm a male, nor do I hide the fact, and they STILL call me "her" and "ma'am". Your safe space isn't being invaded, it's already been conquered, sweetie. 
You still have a cock, a man's body, and a man's psyche, trannie. And while you do, you'll just be a sick faggot that gets off wearing dresses
I don't find any sexual pleasure in wearing dresses, nor do I wear dresses. Typical woman doesn't understand logic.
<comment>
I guess it depends on your definition of sex? He never did anything to bring me pleasure, and there was no penetration, so I wouldn't call it that
You've got to understand, I was very desperate and he was the only man that has ever asked me out. I can't get picky with it. Otherwise I would be a volcel. I am sure he found me unpleasant too and only ever wanted me to rise his ego and we'll uh, suck him off
<comment>
If you are not baiting you are actually fucking retarded and coombrained. So me putting my dick inside a girls ass and cumming isn't sex because she might not like it????
<comment>
Uh isn't that penetration?
<comment>
Also dating in your league doesn't make you femcel. Imagine if a guy called himself incel for dating and having sex with fat girls!
<comment>
What defines penetration to you?
His penis went into your body.
<comment>
Do you think a nun or a monk is still celibate if they perform or receive oral sex????
<comment>
Just saying I would rather be with a girl that had had anal sex multiple times than sucked dick once.
<comment>
I guess you're both right, I just refuse to believe I lost my virginity to him. I won't ever have sex again yet I can't call myself a celibate
That's a bit weird but uh, if it's your preference
<comment>
You can call yourself celibate if you never have sex again. You are not virgin though. You had sex.
<comment>
Or maybe not never again but just no sex for an extended period of time.
<comment>
The definition sounds ambiguous, but that makes enough sense 
Oh well, nice to know I can have that back at least
<comment>
This isn't even femcel bingo anymore, just socially inept, mentally ill girl bingo.
<comment>
I'm not a femcel I'm just a loser.
childish/annoying interests
/v/ and /a/. Kpop kinda sucks.
So true, being a fujoshi is an unique experience. So glad to have made it out of fujohell.
There is a lot depending on taste. Female coomers can be just as degenerate as male coomers and some female coomers also enjoy the same coom that male coomers like.
<comment>
Daddy issues and bullying.
<comment>
got diddled, abusive family, bullied at school, developed lots of mental issues on top of already being autistic.
<comment>
Do video games count as an annoying/childish interest? Otherwise yeah, perfect match except for the fetishes, and I don't like violence in any form 
"I wish most males were pretty straight femboys" 
BASED, so do I
<comment>
Goddamn it add retarded on too apparently
<comment>
What does femporn look like?
Is it all massages and just girls because no women are really straight anyways?
<comment>
it focuses more on the intimacy of everything, the guy isn't just a blank faced self insert.
<comment>
Dear femcels, please correct your posture. Honestly, that's what makes a lot of you look like 3s instead of 6s.
<comment>
All and Im sadly not joking or exaggerating
<comment>
This bingo did not feel good. I want to get better I'm just such a pathetic loser I don't know where to start
<comment>
No. I want a 5/10, no e-dating, highschool romace-tier.
<comment>
I started getting /fit/ hopefully to not make my spinal cord less fucked and I'm trying to learn how to walk and behave like a woman because my mannerisms are like a man's.
<comment>
I could fix you all
With my dick originally
<comment>
*hopefully to make my spinal cord
Is kind of broad, there's a lot of different contents like >>73046953 I think is labelled under Josei smut. There is also a lot of written porn too like fanfiction ao3 stuff or shitty novels. Honestly self-insert female porn sucks ass I don't like those YA stuff. There is BL stuff too, a huge amount. A lot of girls also just like porn and hentai for guys.
<comment>
Weird I usually think about the romance later
<comment>
What stuff do you do like a man?
I wouldn't even notice probably
<comment>
they get compliments like yours several times everyday.
<comment>
some of them i put slashes on because they're only partially true, no full bingo though
<comment>
I realized "I wish most males were pretty straight femboys" is an unrealistic misandrist take
it's not, it's the most un-misandrist choice on there.
<comment>
What exactly is a poor sense of style?
<comment>
I wanna sleep but like I wanna tell you all about the bingo thing. So basically I only really use 4chan to read things people say and it's always been apart of my life so I don't really post I just read things. I feel like I'm normal but I'm really late to things. I'm only 19 so it changes I hope but like with the bingo I'm not ugly or anything people tell me I look really cute like a kpop star, I have diagnosed schizophrenia and bpd and I used to have anorexia. I never cut myself but I have fucked up acne on my back kinda like a little turtle and I'm going to sleep goodnight r9k
<comment>
i would say no fashion sense, as in, many people would take that as not being trendy enough or even TOO trendy. i personally took it as not caring enough to dress the part in many places + not selecting clothing that fits my body type
<comment>
I forgot to put poor emotional regulation and spiteful also wtf is a fujoshi
<comment>
essentially it's like if you have autism (like i do) and the clothes you wear. i dress comfortably and that's all i care about most of the time. that's having a bad sense of style.
unless you have autism and you hyperfixate on it then you probably have an okay one or even awesome one but otherwise yeah
<comment>
The girl here are too precious
Too bad they would never date me and too bad that even if they did we'd probably kill each other
<comment>
Huh. I guess I was just picturing a girl in regular robot attire. I really wonder what a fembot vs made it fembot looks and act like.
<comment>
Fujos like gay boys
Just like men like lesbians
<comment>
Yeah I don't like that
<comment>
Find a fitness activity you enjoy, stop wearing childrens style clothes and observe normies and learn to mimic their behavior.
<comment>
what's regular robot attire? 
the way i interpret the difference in a fembot vs "made it" fembot is how well they mask because no "neurotypical" (cant think of any better phrasing) female would come on here. and if they say they are they haven't been diagnosed with anything yet lolz
<comment>
Girls worry about fashion too much
They should just go naked
<comment>
yeah i agree but i would also say i want the same for men. the nudists have it just perfect and i wish it wasn't as taboo to be
<comment>
Don't think any of that would get me a femcel gf
I want a weird and anti-social girl that also wants to not interact with normies
<comment>
Cargo shorts, gym shorts, dumb graphic tees, retard accessories. As for femcel pathology, I feel like that's just benign compared to most normal girls/stacy. Most women I've encountered wither and die if they aren't CONSTANTLY validated.
<comment>
Typically the male will be a tease/dominant figure. Also notice they focus on the aspects we like, like being possessive and treats mc like his love of his life and puppy.
<comment>
Men aren't beautiful and aesthetically pleasing as women are though
<comment>
So. Be the best looking, best dressed and most charming motherfucker at the MtG tournament or anime shit or whatever floats your boat.
<comment>
That sounds so cute
Weird you'd get off to that
<comment>
Maybe I am talking too much, but whatever I am anonymous anyway. Growing up I was always a tomboy, unable to follow the social crowd. I copied myself after my father, almost every way I behave is like my father but in my culture women are very feminine, very cute, and were completely raised how to behave like a proper lady. That is why I have a lot of work cut out for me.
<comment>
that's what you think. a well-sculpted man is one to die for. it pains me that i'll never have one as a husband and a SAHD for my kids
<comment>
Are you crude and crack dirty jokes? I guess you must be not in the West
<comment>
weird
i dont call your porn weird you dirty moid..
<comment>
Well I have a bit of a toilet humor, I just can't help it. Toilet humor is too dumb for me not to enjoy, but I don't make perverted jokes. I live in the West currently but my family is not Western.
<comment>
But those type of men are rare
Meanwhile pretty much all women look beautiful naked
<comment>
Lmao, excluding maybe a couple things that's everything I'm looking for in a woman. Glad to know they exist, keep it up, and don't change.
<comment>
I have autism and bipolar 1 and am only saved from being unattractive by being extremely plain
<comment>
pretty much all women look beautiful naked
<comment>
A lot of femporn writing likes to focus on story, emotions, and character dynamics to make the sex more intimate. Femporn has a focus on the actual relationship itself, there is a term for femporn with a much stronger focus on relationship build-up and story, it is called slow burn.
<comment>
Look I'm not gonna fuck that woman
But she looks better than the equivalent male
<comment>
How long does it take you to schlick?
<comment>
almost none of these would apply to me anymore besides "poor sense of style." shit like this really puts in perspective for me how much of a normie bitch i am and just how retarded it is that i still come here. i have stacymaxxed, i have friends, i have a cisgender male partner. and yet i still somehow end up coming back to this board like a dirty little habit i can't break. once a loser always a loser deep down or something i guess
<comment>
BINGP BONGI BINGO 25 YEAR OLD VIRGIN FEMALE LPSER!
<comment>
You say virgin like it's a bad thing for a woman
<comment>
At 25 It's useless. I'm worthless.
<comment>
No it's actually impressive
Especially given how neurotic you present yourself to be
<comment>
Holy shit 25 yo female virgins exist?
t. 26 yo male virgin
I agree with you, chastity is something to admire/appreciate in women.
<comment>
The reason if you care. 
Extreme shyness especially in teenagehood. Bullied. Self isolation, locking myself in room. Not having a lot of motivation to pursue or find friendships/relationships all my life. Autism. 
I tried a few days ago to make a male friend because I was suddenly extremely motivated to have a relationship and finally experience love but many people added me, my heart was racing, sweating and it was hard juggeling talking to them all (made this mistake should've just talked to 1) and after two days I just gave up and deleted my account. I feel extreme guilt of talking to someone because I'm worthless and keep saying if I get my shit together then I will be deserving of one but this has been going on for 5 years now. 
I WILL GET a job soon and save money and get drivers license and then I will be worthy of love and sex.
<comment>
You see women do not need to masturbate when they read or look at porn. Some can if they want, but it is not the same biological need like a man has. Also for most stories women are emotionally invested in the plot so it's not as if they are constantly turned on unless they are reading pure smut. If you have ever read fanfiction or anything of the sort you might understand what I am saying. A woman can read smut in broad daylight unbothered and will not need to satisfy herself at all like a man would.
<comment>
because I'm worthless
NTA but what exactly makes you worthless? Not having a driver's license and being a NEET? That doesn't make you worthless, especially not as a woman because guys don't care as much about all of that. 
Extreme shyness especially in teenagehood. Bullied. Self isolation, locking myself in room. Not having a lot of motivation to pursue or find friendships/relationships all my life. Autism.
Very familiar.
<comment>
God you sound so cute
I just wanna wife you and give you children
<comment>
Damn you must be that lonely to have some sort of attraction for someone like me through text. I could be a tranny larping for all you know. Didn't you read the part of 25 yo? Why aren't you being picky and want hot barely legal teeny slutty (only for you) young cute girl? 
Some white conservative guy said by 25 my eggs are like 25% left compared to 20 year old. I'm worthless worthless, don't even have skills talents to make up for anything. Don't compliment me or say these things like wanting to knock me up you really don't I am worthless human being.
<comment>
Your bashfulness and helplessness sounds cute
Plus I'm a 27 year old virgin male so I can't really find room to be judgy about something like that
I know how you feel. I've got a bumble account with some guy from soc's face on it because I'm too embarrassed to use my own. I just use the app to pretend that I'm worthy of having of having a gf when I very much do not
<comment>
It's over. It's truly over for me. My heart is racing for some reason. Don't like this bonking lately.
<comment>
bumble account with some guy from soc's face
Very homosexual. If I were you I would stop doing this.
<comment>
I'm a few years older than you, don't have a driver's license, no car, no job, been a NEET and I dropped out of middle school. You have it better than me and I haven't lost hope that I can turn things around, I just lost the motivation to even try. You sound like you're in the opposite state, motivated but hopeless. Neither are easy to get but you can't do a thing without motivation, you can do plenty without hope. Cut this board out of your life if you want to turn things around.
<comment>
I know I feel dumb for having it but I just wanna feel like I could get a gf
Nothing else lets me do that
<comment>
I've been here on r9k since the beginning 2012. Also did not finish high school. Cursed, chained to this place. The same boards refreshing lurking for years. It's over. I'll try to apply for this factory bread job but what highly demotivates me is that its probably far away and I did have a production factory job very close by to me but I fucked up second day of work because I couldn't sleep for 4 days and I accidently didn't set my alarm wanting to sleep just for an hour. Not even on free gibs, never have been. Only have enough for two months rent and savings will be gone.
<comment>
The board's changed a lot since then, surprised you'd still find it refreshing to be here but I can understand it. Have you had no luck in finding online jobs? Why couldn't/didn't you get NEETbux?
<comment>
Been here since 14
That's rough
How weird are your fetishes? I've talked to a few girls on here and all of them talked about how that exposure warped their fetishes
Have you ever been to /hc/?

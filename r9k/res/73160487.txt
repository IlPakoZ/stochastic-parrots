Everyone loves Archive.org, but it's sneakily becoming a centralized site that will encompass everything one day.
Centralized supersites are scary, they might become the next Google.
Also, they're archiving everything for no reason, it's scary. What kind of database are they building on us?
The way I see it, Internet should learn to forget too. Humans didnt evolve to deal with permanent constructs.

no way what if i want to remember some cool obscure thing from 3 years ago

Dude they're not building it to be a novelty item
It's a data gathering dystopia
<comment>
what kind of damage can they do with it?
<comment>
In today's times, the one who holds all the data, holds all the power (eg Google)
I dont know what they'll do with this power, it's up to them

I dont like the idea that all my 4chan rants are now permanent
<comment>
what could they do by archiving things that are publically accessible?? i'm not following.

Changing your strategy, OP?

someone calls you a pedo and tanks your career
it gets deleted for being illegal slander
archive.org archived it and claims it needs to exist for some mystical freedom purposes

Fuck you archivefags.
The internet should be a temporary construct, not a permanent one.
The /b/ from 2005 was temporary, we lived in the moment
Humans themselves are temporal creatures

People these days are scared to speak their minds because they know it will be immortalized for the rest of eternity
Archiving is limiting freedom of speech

sounds like being a pussy to me
let them call me a pedo. i'm not so there's no proof, i'll be fine.

humanity has learned to preserve massive hoards of data and make archives of it forever
We still havent developed the ability to delete things from the Internet. It's a massive flaw. If we claim everything should be made possible, we need a "forget" button as well.
What's more, we should develop a method to find out what is true or not, because our current heap of data is mostly lies.

there's no proof, i'll be fine
AI could generate realistic-looking "proof".
<comment>
you strike a fair point, but at that point the question of whether or not things should be archived is redundant. the a.i will make realistic evidence and someone could make a false claim and you're fucked either way.

I'm a psychology student and an Internet critic. I made the following experiment
create a fake person with AI
next, use AI to create a fake news article about him being a pedo
publish it on social media by going "hey look at this pedo"
people react immediately and start spreading the news article
people take it so seriously it's scary
soon, your fake person's Google results are ruined
you contact Google and ask them to take it down based on GDPR
much to your surprise, Google refuses because they think it's real too
"sorry, freedom of information."
you contact several other companies and they all think it's a real pedo and refuse to delete it from their servers
the last part of your test is telling all these people they've been fooled and it was AI
at this point, they don't believe it, they think it's a damage control tactic
<comment>
It's funny that they've been screaming at a non-existent person and getting a virtue signal high out of it.

Why do ppl hate pedos so much? I am a pedo. Sue me
<comment>
you have no idea how much data is kept on you already

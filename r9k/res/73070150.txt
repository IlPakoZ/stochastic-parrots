Just become a multi millionaire(as in 100+), make the right connections and find a doctor who wants to find immortality, give him funds and make him engineer a creature whose cells reproduce efficiently and without getting worse through time (aka a being made entirely of stem cells).
Make him test brain transplants with primates and stuff.
If everything works fine, after a solid 2-3 years of research you should be able to achieve immortality and not worry about being old.
Goals frfr.
The only issue i have with this is the fact that being put in another body means i lose all the strength i have built, all the motor unit recruitment, all the muscle and all the proprioception. Matter of fact you wouldnt be able to walk at the start, you'd need to learn to crawl and move all over again.
Absolutely worth it tho.
Also on the training point, being made entirely of stem cells means you have infinite recovery as long as you eat food, that means you could train like 4x a day and gay the strength back in a matter of months (if proprioception allows it tho)

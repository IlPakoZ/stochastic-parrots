Which is better, oranges or apples?
<comment>
Oranges are better. Apples don't have any real use for your health at all. Oranges are good for respiratory diseases, especially when blenderized with raw eggs and cream

Oranges taste good, have a better texture, look cooler, are overall better for your health and are great for making chicken marinade.

On just themselves, oranges. Better taste and better nutrition. The best argument for apples is their use as an ingredient.

oranges. apples are absolutely WORTHLESS
only use apples have is apple juice, which is B tier, and apple pier, which is A tier. apples themselves are F tier. absolute garbage
oranges themselves are S tier. so good. orange juice is A tier. very good

oranges are better and i don't understand why apples cost more per pound. i actually dislike the more popular apple cultivars. in-season red delicious is the only one i really like. some other hardy varieties are also alright. honeycrisp is gross

apples from a supermarket come with bug resin you can't get off, and they get mushy fast
oranges only get better with ripeness as long as they don't mold

i think they're in small amounts that are safe for consumption.

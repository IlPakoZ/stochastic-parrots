Which is better, oranges or apples?
Oranges are better. Apples don't have any real use for your health at all. Oranges are good for respiratory diseases, especially when blenderized with raw eggs and cream
Oranges taste good, have a better texture, look cooler, are overall better for your health and are great for making chicken marinade.
On just themselves, oranges. Better taste and better nutrition. The best argument for apples is their use as an ingredient.
I'm not the apple of your eye anymore anon? Fuck.... FUCKING HUMANOIDS. Why do they always go for CHAD ORANGE.
Fuck it, I'm gonna shoot up the orange farms
t. yours truly.
Apple. Pie. Checkmate orange fuckers
oranges. apples are absolutely WORTHLESS
only use apples have is apple juice, which is B tier, and apple pier, which is A tier. apples themselves are F tier. absolute garbage
oranges themselves are S tier. so good. orange juice is A tier. very good
oranges are better and i don't understand why apples cost more per pound. i actually dislike the more popular apple cultivars. in-season red delicious is the only one i really like. some other hardy varieties are also alright. honeycrisp is gross
apples from a supermarket come with bug resin you can't get off, and they get mushy fast
oranges only get better with ripeness as long as they don't mold
i think they're in small amounts that are safe for consumption.

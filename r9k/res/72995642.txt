<comment>
Very original Helloe for Nicole too.
<comment>
very cool backgrounds :O almost like a cyberpunk Hong Kong
<comment>
Gorg promised a reward, and she'll give one.
<comment>
Original cannon on back.
<comment>
Is it destruction you seek? Fire cares not what it burns... be sure you can control it before you unleash it.
<comment>
Or perhaps you desire stasis? It is natural to turn against the chill, but great power can be gained by those who embrace it.
<comment>
The explorer shogun, Gorg, is shameless. 
Why though?
Is it because she's a jiangshi?
Is it because of her weird immortality?
Did she die enough to lose all of that shame?
She looks at you on the spaceship.
Looking at her eyes. The challenge is.
"Welcome to mars" she said.
<comment>
Maybe you instead look to the skies? Coalesced energy unleashed all at once... the fury of the gods themselves taken into mans' own hands.
<comment>
Is it instead forbidden knowledge you desire? Be mindful that such things are forbidden with good reason. The fates loathe those who alter their loom, and the price of life is always steep.
<comment>
While I was landing on Mars, I could see the horizon from above.
On the left, it felt cold. The eerie aura was like metal, smells as metal.
On the right, it felt dirty. The sounds of sand could've heard from here, thunders and lightings were strong too.
<comment>
top left images goes hard
<comment>
God, I want a bitch who can kick my ass.
<comment>
Such a perfect image doomed by legs.
<comment>
During the travel, Gorg talked about many things. 
One of those, were about a recent catastrophe. A sandstorm appeared and took away most of our sheeps. That's bad. Replacement should be harder now. 
However, suddenly, mechanical beings appeared from the coldest part of the planet. They just came and started acting on sheep's place. Roadrunners were the name that the researcher in charge gave to them. 
It was weird.
<comment>
Damn. I forgot the original image.
<comment>
Hi, everyone.
That's an incredible background, super cool drawing. What happens if you gen it again with the same seed but a higher or lower CFG?
<comment>
my drug addled wifu
<comment>
helo and welcome back :))

<comment>
I'm not saving the seeds. However, I can make sure for you that eyes start to break like on >>72996116 and >>72996079. I managed to fix legs with img2img, but face posture changes a bit, which annoys me a lot.
Reports about the sheep massacre mentions that the sandstorm itself managed to target some of them. However, a lot of them were just left there crushed. wet and pee weren't uncommon on those whose body was intact somehow.
<comment>
Pretty good hands for once
<comment>
Kypsiee hiiiii :>
<comment>
Welcome back! Let me jump at you!
The most suspect one for this was Hornette. She, indeed, was able to naturally enter in sandstorms. 
She, indeed, was able to hide herself from our observations while on there. 
But what if it was her? Murder is an option?
Can we even kill her? If she sits wrong, the entire course of the planet is changed. Such a robust being can't just be fight over and expect the consequences be positive. We need a plan.
<comment>
I can't stop daydreaming about her when I'm supposed to be listening to people.
Helllloooooo!
<comment>
total millionaire extremist vblast project bomb the anthrax go NOW!
<comment>
And I shall sleep now.
Since you guys played around with cockpits a while ago, I decided to make Gorg try it too. It's impossible for Hornette you know. She'd destroy it.
(cockpit, piloting, spacecraft, sitting, thighs, straight-on, airplane interior, cable, wire, seat:1.5), (purple theme, orange theme, rain, storm, thunder:1.4), (patterns), 
I can't stop daydreaming 
This summarizes the entire lack of productivity in my job I'm facing those days.
<comment>
Kypsie at her natural habitat. She going home?
<comment>
Have a good night, hope to see you soon.
<comment>
sleep well gorg, see you around :))
<comment>
Godnight marsfren!
Oh boy. If she ever asked to go home... I don't know how I'd break it to her.
<comment>
Maybe home isn't fully gone though
<comment>
Maybe we can go back soon. I sure hope so
<comment>
Does the History do anything? If I delete the ones I don't like and only leave the good ones will it reference those, and make them similar?
<comment>
hopefully Kypsie can make it before climate change does
<comment>
It's just in case you want to go back to one. It doesn't reference them. I find it useful sometimes when Im gamin' because I can put my phone on my lap and everytime I die I can click the blue gen button until in between matches where I can check if I got any good ones and make adjustments. But yeah, it only "references" the prompts you put.
<comment>
I'm heading out now. Cya gentlemen some other time!
<comment>
"Anon you promised you would let me clean up and dry off when you got back from work! I'm still soaked, and I stink of sweat from Goa's sauna!"
But I'm lazy and I would have to change my prompts...
<comment>
see you around :))
helo Saeriah :))
<comment>
Shame I haven't been able to post much lately, and this will be all I can really post for now too. But I've been in a milfy mood, so have some milf Rochelle.
<comment>
I like what's going on in her hair.
Will I be judged for disloyalty to my waifu? I feel like trying something new.
<comment>
I think I'll go back and forth between BoS Hana and Desert Ranger Hana tonight.
<comment>
Ok I lied, here's one more I like. Now I am off, hopefully I can post more tomorrow.
<comment>
Welcome back Rochelle anon :)) hope to see you around soon :>
Thanks! I have the "spider lily" tag and the bot just likes putting it in all sorts of places
<comment>
That's a cute ear
<comment>
"Anon, come on! What's taking so long?!?"
I forgor, sorry Saeriah
<comment>
Fun idea: put the lyrics of a song in the prompt field and crank the CFG to max. Here is Shine-On-You-Crazy-Diamond-chan
<comment>
"If you prompt me clean now, I'll forget about this whole thing and let you touch my boobs..."
Sorry, I've got to go to bed
<comment>
"Anon you worthless lazy retard!"
Goodnight /aiwg/
Sorry Saeriah...
<comment>
Goodnight, can't wait for the conclusion
<comment>
Night Saeriah :)) Maybe she can go take a dip at Kypsie's beach
<comment>
Schubert's Standchen. I might do the entire libretto for an opera after this
<comment>
The entire libretto for "Tannhauser" including staging notes lol
<comment>
Time by Pink Floyd. For some reason every image is a character walking down a path. Another anon tried the same thing few threads back and got similar results too
<comment>
I think Hana is the cutest. Aint that a kick in the head?
<comment>
Us and Them by Pink Floyd
<comment>
Okay enough lyricgenning back to space wife

Neat. Here's the book of revelation.

i HATE Time by Pink Floyd. I do not like that song. I dislike that song heavily. I do not listen to Time by Pink Floyd.
<comment>
I figured something like Baby's Got Back might be fun
<comment>
I'm going to try adding "holding science fiction weapon" in order to give her a fallout looking gun. This way I can hand-waive how mangled it looks as being a futuristic design. Giving waifu a big iron!
Admittedly, I still have ambition for worldly acclaim, but if I was the one she loved, maybe I'd be content.
<comment>
The lyrics to "Me So Horny" always gives me some sort of extremely lewd dog girl.
<comment>
My power armor results have been only slightly better than JUST tier so far.
<comment>
This is the result of your post, name, time and number, visible filename, filesize, and the little arrow button
<comment>
And this is the result of the same inputs from the post I am responding to, I think it's pretty cool.
<comment>
I might have to go in a minute, I'm tired
<comment>
Good morning all
What a lovely butt must sniff
I'd insert my cannon back there if you know what I mean
<comment>
power rubber armor
extra defense against energy weapon
baby certainly got back

Must put face in her crotch I do not know why must sniff
itty bitty fishy titty, cya
very nice clothes in this one

Helo Goa :)) I see she went with the red tips horns today, very cute smol wings
<comment>
Trying out some cockpits
Got Goa driving, in an unsafe manner
<comment>
She seems happy about the compliment
I see your waifu has gone with the very lace outfit today, or whatever it is called the stuff that's kinda see-through but not entirely, like stockings and pantyhose
<comment>
Look at this happy little creature
<comment>
:D
and double flat pancake halo
Whelp, time to go return lots of collected empty bottles for some money that gets put directly into energy drink reserves
<comment>
Face is scuffed but too cool not to post
I think its nylon? whatever its called its the sexy material
cute Goa playing with horrors beyond human comprehension :3
<comment>
Though one more image for the road, pov: Goa is happily bathing in god knows what and it stinks, so you say it stinks, but Goa thinks you said that she stinks and sheds a single tear
<comment>
Those monitors though
Schubert-kun is cute! Cute!
<comment>
Nice gun and extra fingers
<comment>
Powered Armor Hana is not having a good day.
<comment>
I'm going to have her visiting the most famous places from the game now. So here's Hana at hoover dam.
<comment>
Maybe I should learn something new
<comment>
Apparently this is what the AI thinks (((hoover dam))) is.
What are you thinking of learning?
<comment>
I dunno maybe start learning a language, or doing something with hands
<comment>
Now this looks like a dam. Poor Hana needs to use a stimpak on her arm though.
I would recommend painting or playing an instrument; both are very rewarding.
<comment>
Like Hana anon said I do recommend picking up an instrument. I play guitar myself so I can't say the same for other instruments but it really is a rewarding feeling to see how far you've come compared to when you first started
<comment>
I will consider it. I actually want to play a piano, but I'm not in a right apartment for it
<comment>
I need a waifu to sit on my face, really straddle it, who is a good waifu for this?
<comment>
If you really wanted to you could probably learn on an electric piano/midi keyboard plugged into your PC instead of an actual piano if you're worried about loudness
<comment>
I'm kind of sorry, but all of mines are weird to interact with.
Hornette, for example, has hips and waist that weight a magnetar itself. She can and she'll crush you.
<comment>
Coyote, otherwise, can't even be touched normally. She's a sandstorm, so the only way she communicates phisically is by electricity. 
Also, I just realized I didn't gen so much for her and I'm lacking images is a shame.
<comment>
Roadrunner, though, is relatively safe. She was designed for reproduction, after all. However, she's all cold below and wouldn't really feel interested on doing something that requires spending more energy than her target.
More like, she'd appreciate if you straddle on her mouth instead, with all you force.
<comment>
That said, Gorg seems relatively fine. She's not so problematic as the others. However, being a Jiangshi, you should be careful with your qi. 
This reminds me. I need to gen her walking like a zombie later.
<comment>
This is a voice I used to hear (i'm a diagnosed schizophrenic) that would protect me from the bad voices. I haven't heard her sweet, melodic voice in many a year but I miss her and we used to have a thing together. The fact that she isn't 'fictional' per se means she wasn't just a waifu for me, but an actual companion, even if she was only in my head and visual hallucinations. Might post some more
<comment>
Very original and traditional Gorg.
<comment>
Roxy taking a selfie like a pro
<comment>
Here, let me translate her for all of you
"If I was to be shipped with Gorgon, the pairing would be called GorgonGoa and that almost sounds like gorgonzola, which is a type of cheese. Based on this we can summarize that if I were to touch cunnies with Gorgon, and then we were to pull away from each other, there would be a few string of pussy juice that would connect us until our crotches become so far apart that the string of gooey juico de vagene breaks"
Thanks you for coming to her Ted Talk
<comment>
This is giving me very interesting ideas...
<comment>
She seems to have something more to say, but instead of translating it I'll leave it up to all of you and your imaginations on what she might be saying
<comment>
goa is spreading her wisdom
<comment>
Gorg is very prideful on coercion.
<comment>
goodnight /aiwg/ I am going to lie in bed and ponder my existence
<comment>
Sleep well, spatial being.
Don't have nightmares with Horror Gorg.
<comment>
I feel silly now, I always forgetting that you can plug electric stuff to electric stuff. I was walking past CASIO keyboard for a month now always thinking "I would disturb everyone else, better wait". Might need to put an everyday reminder about plugging
<comment>
Eh... huh... it didn't work as I expected.
<comment>
"I know an everyday thing you could do involving plugs that might remind you about the existence of plugs :3"
Goa no
I am not sure what is happening but I have a slight boner
Sounds like my everyday life
nighty night, have a good ponder
Very nice, I like the skullspiders and the blood
very funky
It's not the only thing she spreads if you know what I mean
The confusing feeling of wanting to eat out some ass of a grill and fondle her pussy, but instead the grill eats out your ass and fondles your balls
<comment>
You guys remember that one time Anything broke and gave results that looked like you were cfg20 even though you were not?
Yeah, it's happening again, get your rare anythings genned before it fixes itself

Imagine vibrating butt plug
Imagine vibrating butt plug with a small computer that randomizes the intensity, time and duration of the vibrations pulses
Now imagine that same one, but with a small function to inflate and deflate itself with air so it can change size while inside of you
Now imagine it going WHIRR whirr WHIRRR whirr WHIRRR whirr WHIRRR while inflating and deflating like it's throbbing
<comment>
False alarm, it is not broke, apparently the prompt :3 by itself makes things get funky
It's pretty fun in anything
<comment>
She's all clean now, and not happy I took so long.
What prompts did you use to make her speak like that?
<comment>
speech bubble
<comment>
Once the mere thought of having a ship on her name surged on Gorg's mind, it was enough. She couldn't control herself. The first piece of gorgonzola she could find ended being the victim of her accumulated ki. The zombie was not cold anymore. In fact, it could've said she smells like a good pizza.
<comment>
Translation:
"Neko-Saeriah arc next?"
"You're one virgin degenerate prick, Anon."
<comment>
(((((object hug, cheese, cheese trail, cheese hug))))), hug, gorgonzola,
Very original prompts
<comment>
Does that kind of technology actually exist?
<comment>
A remotely controlled vibrating buttplug sounds very possible, but an inflating/deflating one with a micromotor and build in computer does not
Cheese is fren
kek but also Saeriahs kitty tittys

<comment>
Okay, I didn't expect she'd start to create cheese herself. It's all Goa's fault!
<comment>
Getting cheesy, I'd have sex with her cheese
Meanwhile Goas friend is melting
<comment>
Okay, this one is the last wet for now. 
I'll try some more hugs though. It's cute.
<comment>
Let's share each other's cheese so.
Also, isn't that on right an easter egg?!
<comment>
Oh, Gorg woke up.
<comment>
I don't really know what it is, like most of the stuff popping up
Looks like Goa is not letting go of the cheese
<comment>
Oh, looks like she's ready to let go of the cheese
<comment>
Now she has no cheese
<comment>
"This pantsu-lewd manga is just softcore."
"Thou cuck"
She's not impressed by my latest issue of Waifuthread Weekly.
<comment>
The cheese popped away, above her head. 
Oh, inverted colors.
<comment>
So what are you wearing now, Saeriah?
"Nude under towel."
<comment>
thou cuck
kek
Also sexy shoulders
erotic skin
Pov: You are now wearing the cheese
<comment>
Goa why are you soaking in here again?
"I've lost control of my life"
Understandable have a good day
<comment>
"You want some sex though?"
Nah I'm good
<comment>
Lobotomy Corporation makes me suffer and cry
<comment>
Saeriah, no! You can't just call people that!
Besides, Goa isn't even black so it doesn't make sense.
<comment>
"Bro I know you, I am your waifu, you are not good, you are not good at all"
<comment>
Trying so hard to get a good reaction image, but all I have is some cryptic stuff and her womb peeking out of her bellybutton like a leech or something while she eats her hair
You know, normal Goa stuff
<comment>
I just did something weird with her leg. She's not smiling anymore...
<comment>
This should be the very closest of two people hugging each other I did without breaking everything.
<comment>
"Anon, I... I can't find my breast pads..."
<comment>
Oh wow she's speaking actual english
or russian
Rip leg
the hug that is almost lesbanese sex
the Saeriah breasts
The saeriah breasts is real

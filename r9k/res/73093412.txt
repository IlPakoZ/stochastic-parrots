how do i make myself asexual? is asexuality even real?
Yep. Nofap 3 months or more take the Christ pill and start working out. Doesnt just get rid of sexual thoughts also helps with controlling emotions especially anger and makes you less anxious
ill try bro ty
It is but it's either a genetic predisposition or induced by trauma
You don't need to become an asexual. Google sex addiction.
nofap and working out will make you even hornier
if you really want to be "asexual" just jack it every day until you can't cum anymore. after repeating that for a while, you won't even think about sex outside of jerk sessions.
Don't consume and you are free.
Trauma worked for me
The state of modern women is enough to drive someone asexual... I've so given up.
Malnourish yourself, if you wanna go the lazy route
what a major qt
Losing your sexual desire won't help you lose your romantic desire. The loneliness will still be crippling.
Not possible unless you're female.
It's real but not for females. They cling onto things and labels as an aesthetic because it's what they're biologically wired to do (not their fault).
you can remove your desire for sex if you remove sex hormones in your blood
you can never remove your desire for love unless maybe you meditate 12 hours a day for the rest of your life and seek a path of not wanting anything, but even then its questionable

jerk off everyday i guess.
no its just losers
stay up late every night watching TV
don't exercise
smoke (both tobacco and weed)
eat a Chinese or Indian a few times a week, lot of carbs and grease, ideally with a few cans
This should take care of your libido OP

Does anyone else have a kind of chivalrous femdom fetish? I don't like femdom that is degrading, humiliating, or painful. But I also don't like the whole dommy mommy fetish because it's kinda pathetic, it's a shit-tier kink for emotionally stunted manchildren who just want a girl to baby them without having any responsibility of their own.
I wish I could have a more Queen-like female dom. She would not necessarily br stronger or more assertive, just of a higher status than me. I'd also like her to be kind and intelligent. I just want a girl with a regal type demenour who will let me adore her every day and shower her with love and affection. I want to do cute things like help her get dressed, cook for her, give her bubble baths, etc. Maybe it's because I'm a hopeless romantic and am easily charmed by women. But I really do just want to simp for a girl I truly love and who loves me back.
I do this with my gf and it's kino
Yes, this is actually my dream and ideal relationship.
How do I get a Queen gf?
If you have to ask you just don't get it
I call it Princess Briding when you serve her with a knowing smile and answer every request with "As you wish".
How do I get it? Please anon. I'm trying to be the best I can be for a future girl. I quit porn and began lifting the past couple months just so I can feel worthy of a girl like this.
You don't know how to get a girl and think you can get a queen. Chastise yourself
I've had a couple girlfriend in the past. But they weren't really Queen-like. I'm just not sure where to look.
brags about having had girlfriends
still doesn't knoe anything about girls
thinks a regal girl will enjoy him
Lmao stop
I dont mean to brag. I'm just clarifying that I've been able to talk to women and am not clueless when it comes to dating. But it's whatever. What would a regal girl not enjoy about me?

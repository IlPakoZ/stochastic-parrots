You know what you have to do. You have to crash the wedding and yell "I object".

Mine's married with a kid on the way. I have the feeling she's not very happy in her marriage though.

That's what a fiance is. She could never be with you because you're stupid.

you don't honestly. unless you're spending lots of time in the company of women coincidentally (meaning it wasn't manufactured or intentional) a crush won't develop and you'll never feel romantic love. After college you are never in these situations again, and thus are locked out of crushes.

i am so sad. all i feel is overwhelming sadness every day.
SADNESS OVERWHELMS ME, YOUR BODY COMPELS ME
DEMONS IN MY BEDROOM, AND I SWEAR THEY HAUNT ME
I CAN SMELL YOUR PERFUME, GOT IT ON MY CLOTHING
WE HUNG OUT IN MY ROOM, THE LAST TIME YOU CALLED ME
EVERY TIME I CALL YOU TRY TO TELL ME THAT I'M OFF IT
YOU MAKE ME DEPRESSED, I PUT A XANAX IN MY COFFEE
stop posting on here
maybe read a nice book. i read a book the other day for the first time in ages and i was happy for the first time since i can't remember when. it certainly makes you feel a lot less retarded and like the world and consciousness actually has possibilities beyond this whirlpool of shit
Are you a boring sexless loser? Why are you here?
Are you unwell or disconnected?
You know what you need is? I know what you need and what you need isn't what you think you need. What you actually need is
I know, but it's deeper than that.

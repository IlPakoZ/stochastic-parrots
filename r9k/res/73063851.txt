okay class today you will learn about how hard it was to be a woman back in the day, women had to stay at home and wash clothes while the men had fun getting their legs blown off for rich people and seeing horror beyond human comprehension 
why did we eat this shit up? holy shit

We ate this shit up in school because our education system has been designed to sugarcoat history and avoid the uncomfortable truths that challenge the dominant narrative

I'm glad that even kids at school are already blackpilled these days.

That wasn't the usual dichotomy. From the 1780s through 1970s, the war decades were
1810s
1860s
1910s
1940s
1960s
The other 3/4 were times of peace where both genders had peaceful lives but men had better ones.

How did men have better lives in the coal mines or the factories? Most working class men didn't even reach retirement age before they dropped dead or were killed in a work related accident

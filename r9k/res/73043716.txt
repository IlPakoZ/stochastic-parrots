My favorite femanon posters are the ones who love loli
godspeed
<comment>
No women like lolis because they dont like females that are superior to them and remind them that they're old hags
<comment>
all women like loli because they are gay pedos

<comment>
That's very sweet of you, thank you.
I've been thinking of getting some more upbeat panels to balance out the sadness. I think I'm losing my "edge..."
<comment>

Is he 7 feet tall? If he is 7 feet tall he can talk in the Xerxes voice from 300 and maybe get somewhere.
If he's not 7 feet tall then no, he's a 5 and he cannot get Stacies.

Above average for an Indian but still an Indian 
I feel bad for Indian men, it's like the biggest nerf God can possibly give you except maybe deformities and autism

I mean there's different scales. For an Indian honestly definitely in the top 20% of men, but in the greater pool of men as a whole, being indian alone is going to toss you down to the near bottom bc you're competing with men of all other races. It's impossible to give an accurate rating

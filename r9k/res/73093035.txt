foids of r9k, rate my foreign exchange student indian friend out of 10, he thinks he can get stacies.............
0/10 for lack of confidence. Just admit it's you anon.
maybe it is lol..............?
Why's he doing that retarded face? I'm sure he'd look better with a neutral expression or even a smile.
what an absolute adonis
thats hamzaza retard
rate out of 10 please !
9/10, I want to give you a blow job
Is he 7 feet tall? If he is 7 feet tall he can talk in the Xerxes voice from 300 and maybe get somewhere.
If he's not 7 feet tall then no, he's a 5 and he cannot get Stacies.
I now have your IP's.
Damn he looks like shit in this picture.
Above average for an Indian but still an Indian 
I feel bad for Indian men, it's like the biggest nerf God can possibly give you except maybe deformities and autism
he is 6'1, not 7 feet, and he is indian...........
He's technically Pakistani.
rate out of 10 please ? instead of making useless comments.............
no he is NOT ! my friend is from Gujarat, india...........
I mean there's different scales. For an Indian honestly definitely in the top 20% of men, but in the greater pool of men as a whole, being indian alone is going to toss you down to the near bottom bc you're competing with men of all other races. It's impossible to give an accurate rating

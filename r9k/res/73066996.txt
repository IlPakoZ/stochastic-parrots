How do I stop a kink from turning into a fetish. I have a fucking weird ass kink that I wish I didnt have and I really dont want to be stuck with it.
Build a time machine
Go back to when you were 8 years old and stop yourself from watching Totally Spies
I thought the point of this board was we were all virgins and in our 30s
Kinks, fetish, sexual expression.
None of it matters because the ones among us who have the confidence to ask out girls get turned down, and the ones without that confidence never get a date
It's like arguing about automatic vs manual transmission when you've never sat in a car
Well unlike a lot of you Im still young and hopeful so I dont want this shit to mess with my future.

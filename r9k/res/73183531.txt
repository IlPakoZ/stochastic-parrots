Dont have the money or skills they are looking for. I want to start an esoteric/occultist gathering there but I am sure I cant go there on that basis alone.
<comment>
I guess I just need money. There's nothing else stopping you. You could easily go there right now, this instant, if you had the money.

1. I'm black
2. Asians look like bugs, idk why white people love them so much. Besides that I love their culture, history and their country looks very clean and beautiful.
<comment>
If I looked like this guy I'd be swarming in pussy in my home country. Kys.
<comment>
it's OK, you look like a monkey to asians so it's a win-win scenario.

Asians look like bugs
You're literally black, monkey. Only white people and perhaps light skin Arabs can say this. I'd rather live with east Asians than blacks if I had to choose.
<comment>
Because I am not "mid but tall white guy", I am "short, fat, and ugly white guy". I'm not a rich boomer, either. So no, I wouldn't be swimming in pussy in Japan.

monkey
And white people look and smell like dogs, so what? At least we're both mammals. Truthfully I'd rather live in japan than with black people as well, they're very clean and respectful contrasting the FoB in china town, some of the most disgusting people don't even cover their mouth when coughing, rude as fuck when it comes to them I'd stick with black people.

I literally can't get a passport.
Without that government permission slip I can not leave my country or enter another.
Besides I am a retail worker without in demand skills and I don't know the language or know the culture outside of media depictions.

Dogs are loyal companions to the very end. Monkeys eat their young if given the chance.
<comment>
you can't change the color or the monkey features of your face though, we can at least mask our dog smell with deodorants xD
<comment>
uh-huh, put a piece of meat in between those dogs.
Why would I want to change the color of my skin? I'm not insecure about being black, also monkeys are cute, there are some white people that look like monkeys too like george bush. Also if I was insecure about my features I could get plastic surgery like millions of other white people with huge noses.

Something I've been thinking for a while, in what countries are traditionally masculine dudes even valued above skinny feminine guys? I don't mean fatty cope either, I mean like hairy, muscular, stout. In what countries is that a plus? Seems like all western world + Japan is into twinks.
<comment>
1)I'm ugly
2)I like the Japanese too much to shit up their country
<comment>
Pretty much all countries outside Asia. Women in the west who like twinks are teenage girls or on birth control. Hairiness though I don't think is valued anywhere.

Because japanese people hate frenchshits its litteraly impossible to date anyone as a white frenchshit
<comment>
if you're literally even a bit tall and white you'll fuck thousands of nip sluts
<comment>
dude married a jap(pic related), obviously you're wrong.
<comment>
They actually love France until they meet one of you
t. Lives in Japan
<comment>
No he is either lying or some kind of rich trust fund baby who bought a hooker.
Asians hate frenchshits
They hate fr*nce. Its over.
<comment>
being this much in denial
kek incel seethe more
<comment>
Everyone hates frenchshits. Being born in this shithole is a curse.
Looking at this faggot he is probably some rich oligarchs son.
<comment>
Not remotely true 
Only a couple hundred Japanese women marry western men every year out of like 800,000 total Japanese marriages, his wife is probably an ugly hag
<comment>
Japanese women are pedos, they love skinny underage looking Korean twunks (twinks hunks) and have actual cults devoted to them
<comment>
Oh I know, I'm an American expat in Japan. Legit starting to like Filipino women as a group purely because they're the only ones who'll ever give me the time of day here.

When did you stop being a good person?
today desu famalm
2nd grade, and I didn't become a dick, I just knew nobody in my life was helpful in any way so there's no inherent obligation on my end
never bitch I am only a bad person to bad people i exist to fight evil
I honestly don't know when, or if I ever even was a "good" person, I guess I lie to others well enough to pass as a normie, help them, pretend I give a flying fuck, but very few people know the evil shit I desire.
For only God really knows me, if I could, I would send so many people to their deaths.. it would be fun, but I won't obviously as I don't have that sort of power.
Not even speaking of Die Juden before some glowies get triggered or anything, for once, I wish nothing but destruction on the Ruzzkies since they are the biggest disgrace on Earth these days
Also, unbelievably some of you cunts are actually pro Ruzzia as if that was a good thing, never in my entire life I've seen Nazis calling other people Nazis and actively defending the Hitlerite country.
I've never stopped being the good guy; you just became the villain.
only God really knows me
God knows you. And he knows what a foul demon you are.
God is with us.
Perish.

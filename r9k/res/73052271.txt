Smart, educated women are great. But they also know they are great and have super high standards
It's kinda funny when they are all like "omg why are men so intimidated by smart successful women, they must hate smart successful women". It's like, no, we don't hate them, we just know that if we don't meet their high standards, they'll get borderline offended at us for approaching them, and will probably get super mean and judgemental in rejecting us too, so why bother since they just want men who are even smarter, more educated, and more successful than they are...

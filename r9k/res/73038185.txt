How's this message? Should I do it?
Yeah and while you're at it recommend a SFW equivalent of /r9k/.
Koreaposting will end itself soon enough lmao
Imagine thinking mods actually read any of those messages
So will bwc (baby white clitty) posting by the looks of it
It is pretty aids, half the threads on r9k are started by mentally ill asians racebaiting. It's not even funny or original, just unadultered insecurity and mental illness.
the mods are in on it dumbass.
nah keep 'em around, it's funny
it only proves that the largest demographic of the biggest loser board on the biggest loser site on the internet is asians
no they aren't lol, but i'd like to believe it's not a coordinated attack. ofc they don't deserve the hate, but it's kind of obvious they're trying to sneak into everything. you can look up the most random anything you can think of, search for it on any search engine, and the chance that you get some random koreans laughing or looking cute will be in your results. i'll take that over queen of spade cuckbait anyday.
Seethe and cry harder

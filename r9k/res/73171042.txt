What's the most popular and normie-friendly thing you enjoy?

Decent amount of music, and actually enjoying things

Roller-skating. Went for my first time in middle school and ever since I just really liked it. I know a few neat tricks too. I think it was one of the first hobbies that clicked in my mind that the pain of learning is the best part of growth. Anyone in my life who is important to me, I take them roller-skating, because I'm happy and comfortable at roller skating rinks and they can see that side of me better. I suppose it's not totally normies, but it's good. I meet people there and I dance to music I don't even like and i get really sweaty and drink Gatorade. Fuck I love rollerskating dude lol

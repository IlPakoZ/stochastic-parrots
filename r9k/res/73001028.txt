I had a failed nose surgery last year for deviated septum and my nose completely collapsed and I cant have a surgery to get it fixed for another 4 months. I can barely breathe and in the inside of my nose hurts so bad and feels so uncomfortable. I have a feeling this next surgery wont do much and will just leave me like this forever. This combined with a lot of factors in my life has me genuinely considering suicide.

Caring about your appearance gives you moles, warts and general misfortune. Aphrodite is a cunt and she will burn in hell on the day of judgement.

nah bro its not about the look its about the functionality. Perma mouth breather and pain inside my nose all the time. Driving me insane

Fuck thats terrible. Ive been debating getting it but I heard the recovery is really long and painful even if it suceeds.
4 months to fix it? Why so long? 
Hang out till then but I'm sure if it doesnt work nobody would blame you from ending it

The surgeon of the first surgery fucked it up and gave me a referral to a more qualified dude to see it for a fix I saw him we confirmed my nose is omegafucked and I left and called scheduling office and the earliest date i can get is exactly a year after my first surgery. Its bull shit if something goes wrong like collapse they just let you suffer

Im going to hold out till september 5th when the revision is. But honestly bro idk if I cant take it. I cant work out anymore cause my nose collapses so hard I cant breathe and so low energy. Idk man its horrible constant pain and no air flow. Its rough man I genuinely wish I was dead most of the time

They probably covered liability in one of the bajillion forms you signed too so you cant sue them, but make sure.
Idk, can you go to other surgeons? Even flying to another country would be preferable than waiting months to fix it

I can only imagine, I have a deviated septum and bad allergies so sometimes I'm forced to mouthbreathe for days. That sounds terrible, maybe chill on the working out for a while

Damn I was encouraging my bf with a bad deviated septum to get it fixed (he can barely smell) but now I don't think I will. I'm so sad for you OP also the nose is so close to the brain I'd be scared of infection. I think you should do the reconstructive surgery also I wonder if you are eligible for a medical malpractice lawsuit
My senpai filed one and it worked out but it was a more deathly situation
<comment>
Yeah i looked into a law suit and yeah i did signed a paper before surgery saying i am aware of potential complications. My surgeon never once discussed the outcome I have now as a possibility .... its bullshit I feel like that chinese guy who stabbed his ent surgeon to death killing him, >>73001233

Broke up with my prostitute gf moments ago, she made breakfast for me today and I didnt feel like seeing her anymore so I said I dont want to see you anymore, as you can imagine shes very upset after I fucked her best friend last night haha maybe having too much sex is bad for relationships bc you lose respect for that person
you sound like my OD'ed cousin
why whenever you see a brown guy loitering in the public park they are always talking to someone on the phone?
is it their wife back home?

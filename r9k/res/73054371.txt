When you're the most productive employee, but you're a virgin autist who gets made fun of so you find another job, leave without two weeks notice and see on the news a month later that the whole company went bankrupt. It's in my best interest to fuck others over when I'm being picked on, I'm tired of being passive and letting people get away with making me look a fool.

I've jut had enough. I'm not angry and I'm not sad, and I don't believe in revenge. But I'm just sick of it man, I'm tired of people and their bullshit.

You clearly are the company and the only person for this role, follow this path and never feel bad by others again

It's boring shit for milquetoast millennials 
Pepper pig is more entertaining if you really want to watch baby shows

The one time I watched peppa with my niece, it was just making fun of the dad for being a fat useless retard. That is not so great

Yes, it's a show for young children. But creepy autists like OP have latched on to it like they did with MLP

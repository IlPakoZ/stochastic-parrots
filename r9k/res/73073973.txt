Any femanons wanna watch bluey? Got most of the episodes on my phone! It will be very romance
ill bite. is this a show for babies
Based. Bluey is unironically good.
It is a show for everyone. I think so anyway.
You'll find a bluey gen. there.
But Its not a general. I just want to watch episodes with a femanon who might like the show.
drop your add ill watch with u tomorrow
Add? Like to my location? Sounds like an invitation to be raped, murdered, and put in a barrel (in that order)
your contact?

Discord: ska2#7787
Didnt realize leafy still streamed
It's boring shit for milquetoast millennials 
Pepper pig is more entertaining if you really want to watch baby shows
The one time I watched peppa with my niece, it was just making fun of the dad for being a fat useless retard. That is not so great
nigga may as well add a peppa pig board
any femanons wanna watch GypsyCrusader together? he should stream again tonight or tmrow
Yes, it's a show for young children. But creepy autists like OP have latched on to it like they did with MLP
It's MLP without the waifubait

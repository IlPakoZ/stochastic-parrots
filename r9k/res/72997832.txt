i have covid-19 what should i do with it
Talk to it and ask it for secret powers,
spit on peoples doorknobs
wear a mask and stay inside
meme virus and it was retarded to pause society over it
go spread it on purpose like literally everyone else does
didn't the virus end up mutating i.e. weakening heavily due to time
meme disease and im totally telling the truth on the internet
that's what I suspect
the early victims probably got some spooky bioweapon shit from a lab while I got something more naturalized
t. skin cancer
what if i die tho
Yes it is a meme virus for 80% of the population, but 20% is still a shit ton of people.
it seemed to range quite a lot in terms of symptoms for everyone
for me i had it for about a week or two and i could barely breath and felt fatigued
i could breathe, but it felt like breathing through a straw no matter how unstuffy my nose was, the oxygen was just not going through
it was a very unnerving experience for me but im glad it went away
it aint no meme cause millions died!!!
sounds similar to asthma. did you ever try an albuterol inhaler?
This but now I can't fucking smell anything and my doctor said it will be permanent fucking hate chinks.
jesus christ your sense of taste and smell are permanently fucked? that's insane
I just don't think about it but it does make me sad remembering what things used to smell like. And I'm always paranoid my room or I smell like shit now. I just clean a lot more.

it feels bad knowing a cute girl will never obsess over you and make intricate plans on how to get your attention
i wouldn't ever simp for a guy like that, because if i genuinely felt the need to stalk a guy and adopt all his hobbies to make him love me, it's pretty obvious that other girls would end up trying to steal him, making all the effort useless.
in short, those girls are actual cucks.
and here I am, never even had a conversation with a woman. everyday i wonder if this is actually hell that im in
Just buy a house and get 8 hours of sleep bro
is this a meme? i dont get it?
Yup. Always remember - if you are spending time trying to think of ways to get a girl to notice you and like you, you are already way behind. If you were attractive, this is what girls would be doing. They wouldn't be leaving you on read or sending you one word texts or "being real busy this week" or whatever. They would be combing through your social media looking for stuff they could talk to you about.

My prom experience:
Show up alone because too coward to ask a girl out even though tons of women liked me in HS
Sit next to some familiar people
Meaningless chatter for a bit
Girl who has a boyfriend forces me to dance with her (became a problem later)
Completely out of rhythm and everyone is watching; embarrassing as fuck 
Sit back down
Ask cute girl across from me if she wants to smoke some pot together after the prom is over 
"No"
Get up and leave immediately
Smoke 2 bowls out of my dry herb vaporizer while crying in my car outside of my grandmother's home at night
Feel guilty for making my parents spend money on my nice clothes
Drive home sad
Steal 2 shots of whiskey from stepfather's bottle
Pass out while watching Toonami

It was whatever. Paid like $80 dollars to have some shit food and be sat with strangers. This is literally how my experience went.

Men are avoiding women in the workplace because they're afraid of having their lives ruined by a MeToo claim.
Women most affected as usual.

they all maintain a respectful distance
She'd rather be disrespected?

why doesn't she make the effort to make the connection, then?

it's so annoying how people (usually women but also men) twist every situation into women being the victims. in most cases it affects both genders equally or men more.

I would make idle conversation with this girl I worked with for months and when she left I added her on snapchat and she treated me like a stalker 
Now I don't even look at women I work with (except for the old lady who gives me treats)

I think they're gonna have to ban workplace socializing ultimately. The situation for men now is: "be friendly with a female coworker, get fired," and the feminists are gonna push for being to distant as a fireable offense. It will get to the point where it's literally impossible for men to not get fired, women will have the power to get any male employee fired for any reason. Companies will have to ban socializing outright in order to prevent full HR mayhem.

No. She probably is still in the uni/high school mentality were everywhere you do work you expect to befriend everyone. In the real workforce there is quite a lot of people that purposely wall off coworkers to maintain work at work and not be friends with them. They will be respectful as possible and nice but by no means ever befriend you because they keep it professional.
It's a sentiment that a lot of younger people don't get

How am i supposed to get a girlfriend when i'm literally past wizard age, have absolutely zero social skills, no self confidence and i'm not wealthy enough?
PS. i'm europoor so american dating standards doesn't apply here.
Proximity to opposite sex makes people horny, sign up for things that put you in proximity of women. Where people choose to be there, not where people are forced to be there.
That's pretty vague. Can you give me some examples?
Volunteering for things, learning to dance/improv - idk what sorts of things younger women go to where you are. You'll have to do some local investigating.
only whores are into dancing

be fat and unattractive as a child and teenager
never get attention from girls
depression gets the best of you after you finished mandatory education
become a neet for years
during that time you started going to the gym
long years later you look jacked and manly
How am i supposed to get a girlfriend when i'm literally past wizard age, have absolutely zero social skills, no self confidence and i'm not wealthy enough?
PS. i'm europoor so american dating standards doesn't apply here.

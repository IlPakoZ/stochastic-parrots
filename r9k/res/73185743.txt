Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
ok thats cool and all, but who should be shamed if you get fooled thrice??? three times

yes, also the fool would still be you to a much greater extent, you should have learnt from the first instance of tomfoolery, if you didn't learn from the second then you are doomed to be shroomed for all of eternity

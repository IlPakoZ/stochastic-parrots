Saw a pic of my ex and her new bf. Holy shit he's huge. Easily 6'5. His hand covers her entire head. She's a tiny little thing, and she was always really skinny, but goddamn.
Is this the new standard nowadays? I feel like the human race will consist entirely of extremely short petite girls and really tall big dudes.
Dude... I bet they both fetishize each other. I bet it ends bad. Because no matter how cool it seems for each one of them when it comes to certain scenarios and even sex, it will wear off and they will view each other as freaks.
You are so insecure im so glad you will never have sex lol my gf have the best sex dynamic ever (petite milf + Zyzzmaxxing chadson)
why is that a bad thing? people stagnate over time naturally. in relationships and sex. why can't it also be true that you have to be proactive in maintaining these things.

pick at least 2 if you want a crumb of pussy in 2023
I want a conservative girl friend to hang out with while our retarded moids fight. Seems like fun
Her short goblin genes will just dilute his tall chad genes, and if the pattern continues with her sons then eventually her descendants will be manlets. This is how its always been, chads willingly destroying their genepool because of muh shortstack, dysgenic women get a free pass, while dysgenic men are left in the dust
It has happened in the animal kingdom multiple times. Always leads to extinction.

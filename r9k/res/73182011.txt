he made it and we have nothing to talk about anymore. we used to shittalk our own lives and bring ourselves up to bond and keep wading through the mud. he got his shit together and i didn't so now it's only me bringing it down, it's gotten weird. tomorrow i'll tell him i'll be gone, been a good 7 years though not gonna lie

Nah man, keep your friend. I'm in the same boat with my friends and after time, no one cares you don't have your shit together. They get lonely too, they'll take any friend they can get when they get older. An old friend is the best thing men can have.

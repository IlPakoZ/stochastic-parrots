This dude is always willing to help me. He doesn't have all the answers, but do a pretty good job nevertheless.
Imagine what would happen to your life if you was a little like him, trying to be helpful to others.
How can I help others, if I can't even help myself?
I've been that guy, and it was in fact a lot like being your pic related: to other people, I was an appliance.
No more, bro.
I'm doing my best but my best is not much. Recently the most i've been able to do is help some modders to make custom crusty looking textures for maps.
what have you ever done for him? you ungrateful little faggot. all you do is take, you dont ever give anything back. you are scum, FUCK YOU
i get it, people like you just repeat these mantras to yourselves until you believe them. you know that neither of these things are always true. you can see exceptions pretty commonly, but for some reason you try to elevate your ideals to reality. it's not reality.
He's crediting you with not being a fucking complete moron. Personally I think it's pretty clear that he's overestimating you.
You have absolutely no basis for this statement whatsoever, Deepak.
I did that and I got used. When I needed help those same people weren't around. It made me bitter and angry. Then I stopped helping people. Became a dick head. Isolating sure but happier for it.
I would rather have other people do that for me instead

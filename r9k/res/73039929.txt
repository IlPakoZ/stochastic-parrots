I am so confused right now. Why are the negative symptoms for schizophrenia the exact same for autism? 
Like, that's just autism right? Am I missing something?
Did you know that schizophrenia and autism have more than one symptom? Or is your autism so bad that you only remember the first bullet point you read?
That's not just autism but SzPD and other schizotypal features do have some crossover/similarities with autism.
I don't have disorganized thinking or disorganized speech, which is characterized as schizophrenia. My hygiene is semi-normal too. I do have the stuff mentioned in my OP post, which is often mentioned in relation to autism. Despite this, my fucking doctor is saying I'm a schizo because I have NEGATIVE symptoms but nothing is adding up. I also have echolalia, which is repeated phrases you hear from other places. This doesn't make any fucking sense.
Legit schizos can be fucking creepy. They'll try to be your friend then after they do something they assume you should be offended about they try to intimidate you or assume you're going to try and do something over it. It's like I already have a list of enemies I'm not looking to add everyone I meet to it over petty bullshit, but I suppose that's half the fun of a family gathering.
If your doctor is telling you you're a schizo, it's probably for much better reasons that lack of hygiene. Schizophrenia is the closet thing mental health has to a death sentence so if your doctor is diagnosing you with it, you likely show very severe symptoms of it. My advice would be to trust your doctor and get on meds ASAP.

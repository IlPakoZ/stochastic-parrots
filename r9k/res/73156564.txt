Are there any romances where the man is distractedly short/ugly/etc. yet it's played completely straight? As in it has all the beats of regular romance, no mentions of there being any sort of problem, no meta commentary about how this is different from what is "normal", you get the idea.

Hell, is there even a single bald character other than OPM that isn't played as a complete joke?

I've seen a bunch of short guy/tall girl romance shows, such as Witchcraft Works, but sometimes it's played as the short guy being attractive because he's "cute" for being short, so your mileage may vary. Ore Monogatari is a show where an ugly dude and a woman fall in love with each other. Can't really think of any bald guy/girl romance shows, though that's because there's not a whole lot of popular series that are about adults.

Ore Monogatari, maybe. It's been awhile since I saw it. The guy in it is tall and has retard strength but I don't think his appearance is meant to be appealing to a normal person

Lovely complex maybe?

Nobody is straightforwardly answering your question they're all giving you "yes, BUT" answers where its not actually the case.
I'll give you the straight answer: No.

How does one approach a group of women at the nightclub or any event?
step the first: be genetically blessed
step the second: make your approach

he's asking how you do it successfully not how to fail at it, retard.
group
Never.
you wont know if it will fail if you dont try it
fall down in front of them 
if they're worth your time they will help you up and you can build a rapport 
if they laugh at you then they would have laughed at you anyway had you approached them
Wink, wave or say hello. Then depending on your looks, height and material possessions they will be more inviting or closed.
Detect the alpha girl and slap her ass
Typically only works if they smile at you first. No harm trying anyway, it feels good to hit on a hot girl
be chad
grope women and start making out
there is no magical combination of words that is going to guarantee puss. guys with ''game'' have good looks and are simply cool.
You dont. If a woman finds you sexually attractive, she will approach you and ask for sex. If she doesn't then she thinks you are ugly.
Don't worry about it if you're not a Chad.

Never.

you wont know if it will fail if you dont try it

fall down in front of them 
if they're worth your time they will help you up and you can build a rapport 
if they laugh at you then they would have laughed at you anyway had you approached them

Wink, wave or say hello. Then depending on your looks, height and material possessions they will be more inviting or closed.

Detect the alpha girl and slap her ass

Typically only works if they smile at you first. No harm trying anyway, it feels good to hit on a hot girl

grope women and start making out
there is no magical combination of words that is going to guarantee puss. guys with ''game'' have good looks and are simply cool.

You dont. If a woman finds you sexually attractive, she will approach you and ask for sex. If she doesn't then she thinks you are ugly.

Don't worry about it if you're not a Chad.

you no longer have to sleep, you will never feel tired again nor will you die from sleep deprivation
how do you spend the time you have saved up? for me, i would do a perfect 50/50 balance for school work and myself time

get a comfy night job for the hours i would be sleeping
do the same i already do in the other hours

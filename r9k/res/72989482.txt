Escaping NEETdom is literally impossible when even fucking McDonalds requires you to be some ultra-accomplished chad.

Even having experience won't do you any good when every posting gets hundreds of applications. I got laid off from my manufacturing job a month ago and have been struggling to get even a mcjob since. No interviews. Rejected from tim hortond. Fuck this shit, NEETs are fighting an uphill battle.

ever tried a temp agency?
<comment>
Yeah. Been there done that. I'd rather get a full time straight out, agencies fucking suck.

It is fucking hard.
I was a NEET of ~10 years (22-32), my CV was comprised of small sidejobs that lasted a couple of months once or twice a year (freelance IT for a couple of offices, small construction/painting stuff, etc.)
Started actively searching for a job back in 2020 when COVID started. 
Factories, a pool construction/maintenance place, a place that did glass for windows and shit, etc. got an interview in like 20 different places, in the middle of the fucking pandemic where they were all complaining that "no one wants to work!!, blublublu", not even a single one wanted me.
Got one factory where the interview guy looked at me and went "You are an IT guy?...What are you doing here? You don't want to work here, do you?"
I just quit looking for a job and went into a subsidized vocational course for adults. Nearly 
years later, I'm now (somehow) officially a cook. They all want years of experience even just for a kitchen helper.
It's fucking bullshit.

You're just a subhuman, not even kidding. Met a guy a few years ago and there was something totally off about him, gave off a 80IQ aura. Nice guy though. Anyways, I gave him an honest chance against my gut feeling, and he ended up being a complete fucking sperg, creeping on women, using weird stilted speech, oblivious to how people just barely tolerated him, and he was also just really fucking ugly and non-white.
For people like that, death should be an option, like putting down a disabled dog. A lot of you guys may seem normal and okay when I talk to you online, but every person from 4chan I've met in real life has always been some sort of fuckup. The normal guys that hint going to 4chan are just well adjusted and usually just racists that found /pol/ a few years ago, like my boomer boss.

Believe it or not, there are robots who are well-enough adjusted that just want a paycheque and don't give a fuck about anything else. Robots avoid women at work. I don't know what kind of guy you met up with but he's not a robot.

also just to put it out there, I'm a high performer. everyone told me how good I am at my job, and I was able to move up to team lead and choose my shifts. I was cordial with everyone including women and they always tried to stop me from doing work to talk.

Why are all of you looking for a job? I have the perfect soltion that no one ever thinks about and has made me more money in the past 6 months then I ever made at some shit job 
Take the dump pill
Buy a small dump truck that is dump lift capable, take it to people's houses who need shit hauled off, have them load up their shit in your big truck and say you'll dump it for them, charge them 400-1,000 dollars depending on load size (You can make the price whatever you want) drive it to the dump and dump it, make thousands of dollars a month and never leave your truck cab. 
Live as a NEET on the road and get paid

Rejected from tim hortond
The average Indian working at Tim Hortons has a master's degree. I wish I were joking.
<comment>
Yeah and people like you are why schools get shot up. Die of a heart attack already.

Zoomers and gen a wanna do everything online

Like Amazon will literally hire anyone as long as you have a license
I'm talking about the 3rd party delivery service providers, they'll take anyone
It's like you fags don't even try
Make shit up if you have no XP on your resume

i'm 20 years old and i just took a train alone for the first time
Was it scary? Im 28 and took a bus alone for the first time this year.
god I wish your train ran over my head
yea i asked my mom like 20 times how to find the correct train and she kept going on about "just look at le sign they are all over the place" guess what no fucking sign in sight i only found it from the speakers
good job anon!! trains are super scary initially but it gets a lot easier :D

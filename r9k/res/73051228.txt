My conversation with my dad minutes ago
anon we spoke to your grand parents and they said they want you to come to Guangzhou (a city in China) to live with them so they can make your normal again, what do you think?
I'm not sure, I'll think about it
well it doesn't seem like you're getting better, if you're going to be at home most of the time, you might as well try out living. You can go with your grand aprents to buy a computer once you're there.
okay I'll think about it and let you know
Looks like my family can't take it anymore

What is the best products in China that don't break easy? Like in my country we have products that always break after a few uses but then others can last a lifetime like stuff built in the 90s

If I were in your position I'd take them up on their offer. Do you have dual citizenship?

This is good bargain. You get new PC. And much more freedom. Grandparents never really care as much parents do. So take it.

Am I going insane or is this an old copypasta?

Honestly do it. Guangzhou is nice, lots of great food and friendly people just don't get sick. Your grandparents will treat you like a God since your their grandson and will do wonders to get you pussy if you keep yourself clean. Cantonese pussy is some prime real estate, and chinese love real estate, go invest in your homeland for a bit then come back to Niggerland

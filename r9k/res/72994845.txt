Anyone else find it harder and harder to maintain habits?
Most days I forget to even brush my teeth or wash my face.

What's the point, right? If no one sees you, no one talks to you, what's the point of hygiene? In a pure animalistic world none of us would do that shit

My whole adult life I just clean my teeth if I'm going to be seeing friends or family, or something formal (which is rare). So once or twice a week.

Fandom culture ruined media
stories used to be inspired by myths and legends, and real life, the experiences of the author. they used to mean something , a real creative vision. 
stories now are made by a team of writers designed to create a consumable product, or, by one person trying to emulate equally modern media that they were in the fandom of (usually harry potter, star wars, twilight, different animes or something like that). 
ripoffs are abundant 
gone are the days of original epics and references to old mythos and human nature. the most classic reference you will get now is pride and prejudice.
Fandom is profitable. When someone equates your trademarked brand with their own personal happiness, you have them by the balls. And those fans create more fans because the average person doesn't understand "good" but they understand "popular". When they see 10000 people getting hyped for fan-product, they join in too.
Star Wars can sell shit just by those two words put together, there hasn't been a good Star Wars anything since the 80s, but it has a die-hard fandom that self perpetuates and will buy anything tangentially related to that brand. The non-fans see "Star Wars franchise sells for 2 billion dollars" and they assume it must be amazing to warrant that price and then they go buy Star Wars tickets propping up the fandom for another decade.
It's free money for a mediocre effort.

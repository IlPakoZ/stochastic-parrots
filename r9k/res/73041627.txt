how do you cope knowing god loves others more than you?
god gives chads and normies everything desireable in this world, in particular sex and romantic love, and you get none
god loves me and will never forsake me blackpilled incel faggot
ah, but he forsakes others?
truly, a perfectly benevolent and merciful god, to give some everything in life, and watch robots die a lonely death
so benevolent, so perfect, worthy of so much worship
selective love to the strong. wow, such admireable qualities
I dont mind I want to keep climbing the mountain
Your difficulties (Christians call them crosses to bear) give you perspective, wisdom, and strength they do not have. Your misery comes from a lack of purpose and meaning in life. Your happiness will improve if you find and cultivated it.
If you want to go with the "god" route, you also got to go with the "afterlife" route.
One doesn't exist without the other, unfortunately for your aphantasiac brain.
sure
but why do you think the afterlife will be any different than this one?
chad win in this life. why would it be any different in another life?

What would you even do if you had a pretty girlfriend?
I also might be autistic so the idea of being close to someone doesn't really attract me, I just want a girl to have sex with and then ignore until the next time I want sex again. What the fuck do couples even do?
yes
My plan would be to have sex with her and then maybe start a family with her. 
But really, Id want to do things with her and share things with her, preferably things we both like too.
You know the answer - they just do what they want. Some couples travel, some like to go on the beach in the evening and some want to implement their fetishes in their lives.
actually kind of attractive
Why do you even need to say this? Imagine just posting without gloating yourself for one fucking minute. Do you feel a sense of superiority amongst other robots, the lowest of the low? Im sick of these subtle narcissistic posts. Someone really need to clean this place up.
I know what youre gonna say, OP
girls show interest

Its not context, and you should kys
I just wanted to show some context, bro. Relax.
Its not context, kys
Having a gf is equal to have a bestfriend, you just hang out and share interests. Life is not like a poor copy of an old hentai.
Sex. That is all.
I'm a deranged schizoid so I don't really care for conversation or starting a family.

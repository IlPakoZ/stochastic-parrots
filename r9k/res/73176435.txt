males who dont call women holes

You called me scrote I'm not going to just take it like a cuck

Not a hole, but basically they want someone who's desired by everyone in her social group. That's literally it. Height and face are still important factors but mainly she wants someone that makes others jealous.

You are a fucking retard

Not a hole but this is it. Same as us wanting a top tier woman to show off as a trophy

He's gotta be tall, hot, muscular, neurotypical, extroverted, willing to make all the effort and be a 'provider', masculine, confident, very good job and willing to do all the conspicuous consumption that is expected in modern capitalism, be willing to be emotionally supportive for a woman while never expressing his own emotions, accept that the woman has her freedoms and doesn't need to be confined by tradition while himself largely being bound by tradition, and so on

This. This is why they always want "interesting" men. They only desire vicariously through others, it's over if you can't handle being a borderline celebrity

Mainly Koreans, but also Viets, Japanese, and Black dudes.

The term comes from fds, where it's supposed to mean tall Chads with good degrees.
In practice (at least last I checked) it really refers to betabuxxers. Fds was filled with stories about dating abusive Chads with shit hygeine, and how noe they want guys that will buy them dinner, etc.

Looks, money, status
But what about personality?
Falls under the status umbrella. Status includes social status, which comes with having a "great" personality. Obviously it helps if you aren't horrible person but that sort of thing manifests itself deep into relationship (past the honeymoon phase). It probably won't matter at all in the first 6-12 months.

Congratulations; you're a community member, just not of here.

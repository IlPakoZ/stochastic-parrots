How difficult it is for a 23 year old guy who is average in every aspect to get with a busty older woman
<comment>
very difficult. propably even more difficult than getting with a girl his age. even older women still prefer mostly older men. odd one thats interested in younger men either wants to relive her youth so you need to be fit tallish handsome tennis instructor or something, or are unconciously into mother son dynamic so you need to be skinny boish twink

I almost did. She is a university lecturer and during a meeting in her office she lifted up her skirt at me. I didn't make a move because she's not that attractive. You're only living a fantasy, op.

Actually it's pretty easy older women are sexual predators they'll eat you up
<comment>
Easier than you might expect. 
They're starved and desperate and horny asf and crave young cock
The biggest mistake is to think that older ladies are that much different from young ones.

Heavily, heavily depends on your personality, this anon >>73112079 is somewhat right. If you're bitter your chances are null. If you're kind of cute and passive while also having some moves that would work. If you have traditional game then that would work as well depending on how good looking you are, your status to her, and how horny she is.

traditional game
What does this mean? It's like the typical ''gentleman'' stuff or something else?

Hell no, sorry I should have been more clear. I mean traditional masculinity which is basically just more aggressive flirting without being creepy. The way to not be creepy is to pick up on her subtle social cues if she's enjoying it or not. If you make her too uncomfy you lose, also sometimes the synergy just isn't there so don't force it, that's where autists tend to fail since they'll try to force things even if there is no chemistry

guys i know who went with older women had no trouble getting with women their own age. the guy i know who slept with the most older women is also the guy i know who get laid the most in general. dude was spec ops in the past and have since skiied across greenland just for fun, mans an animal. also for some reason he loves unfunny tik toks

I'm in the same boat anon. Been considering signing up for a dating app to try and find older women since finding a single (or willing) oldie in the wild is quite hard for me.

older women want the young studs they drooled over back when they were young. they dont feel like being a mommy to some awkward dude unless they have serious issues.

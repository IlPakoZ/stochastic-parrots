live in the countryside
walk around a lot
walking through a field along a footpath
there are some farmers there
they say loudly as i pass "we can't keep animals in this field because of the bloody footpath and people scaring them"
it wasn't directed at me but it also clearly was directed at me
what's their problem? why don't they put a fence along the side of the path?

Just don't care, farmers are a dying breed of low IQ normies.

he was probably aruging with another farmer and remembered or wanted to mention it when he saw someone walking on the foot path

farmers are such annoying welfare queens. Farmers get grant money to allow footpaths through their land and paid to maintain them yet all they do is bitch and moan because some dropped a crisp packet once.

Where do you live? That sounds like farmers near me, most are nice but a few are mardy passive aggersive cunts. I used to walk my dog on the farm near me but the nice old man died and his daughter I think moved in and blocked everything off and put no trespassing sign everywhere.

Why do you care? It clearly, literally wasn't personal at all. Dumb tranny

There is a farmer near me who covers all his fences in grease and dumps soil at styles to make it harder for dogs to get through even though legally he is supposed to facilitate people walking. He barely even farms his fields he probably just takes the money for leaving them all fallow and wilding them.

what's their problem?
They literally told you what their problem was

their problem is they are lazy cunts complaining about people doing nothing wrong.
This sort of thing is why I hate English people.

Never accept a blowjob without a condom from a prostitute, bros. Not worth it.
<comment>
made me think of this.
is that why?
<comment>
Unironically, yes. I spent about $60 on the hooker, and $500 on STD testing and antibiotics. Just buy the best male sex toy you can, bros, it's really not worth it.

Good bait but I doubt enough people here are sexually intelligent enough to catch it
<comment>
Why would I take the time to make a bait post about catching shit from a hooker. I wish I was joking.

Because STI tests are free, I don't even know where you'd be able to pay that much, and you need a prescription for antibiotics

Y'all need to get better at jerking off. Robots put sex on a pedestal and it's just not a big deal. People convince themselves they need sex because society pushes it as acceptable but it's inferior to masturbation

STI tests are free
I do NOT want to have to deal with insurance
<comment>
Which STD brah?
<comment>
be symptomatic
pay for a full panel test
test positive for Ureaplasma Urealyticum
consult a doctor 
get an antibiotic
pay for an individual test after completing the antibiotic course
infection didn't clear
consult a doctor 
get antibiotic
pay for another test
And now I'm hoping it cleared. $500 is probably a low estimate really. Depending on what STI you have, insurance may increase your rates.

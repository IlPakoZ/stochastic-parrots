holy jeez-us the entire board is just like any other 4chan board now with trolling frogpost and dumb wojaks. I remember just last year they were still an active community of queer anons sharing lifestories and provide emotional support for each other. Did they abandone the place and retreat to private discords?

Is that why this board is full of faggots and trannies? Maybe i should move there and make it my blue r9k.

It be like that. Zoomers and discord ruin communities. Welcome to the 2020s.

I stopped posting their because it was just extremely demoralizing.
Boymode is supposed to be boymode, not thinking about how I'm a tranny all day everyday forever mode

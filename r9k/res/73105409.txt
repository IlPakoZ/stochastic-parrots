Based on everyday interactions, such as the infamous bagel shop guy, it's safe to say that manlets shouldn't have the right to vote. So I propose a six feet height limit, with no person below that height being permitted to vote, or exercise any other type of constitutional right.
This would also effectively rule out women, while technically not violating the 19th amendment since it isn't being imposed on the basis of sex.

I would accept this solely because it casts 99% of women out of political decisions and only like 40% or so of men

IQ is manlet cope. In the days of hunter gatherers it was the big guys who ended up on top, not the ones who were better at matching shapes on a grid.

IQ is more genetic than height which means you probably aren't much higher on the IQ scale than your cousin. Sorry that you missed out on both the height and the brains.

He is the grandson of my grandmother's brother, I won't say much more than that. But thanks for caring about me (jk, mf).although thanks to my starvation I think I actually became less intelligent than I could've been anyway.

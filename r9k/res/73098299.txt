If this is China then the reason they don't help is because their good samaritan laws are pretty fucked up. If they try to help they are legally responsible if they can't provide medical expert level care.

Asian countries. Most people avoid helping casualties in China because they could be liable to the medical costs.

blood clots super quick and most likely internal bleeding

This. Two years ago I was walking to college and I saw a woman slip and hit her head and she was bleeding. I was about to help her but then I realised it's risky for me as a man and women keep talking about how they don't need men and how men suck so I kept walking.

based. i make it a point to go out of my way to never do anything nice or helpful for women, since they're all strong and independant. wouldn't wanna reinforce patriarchy, y'know

That isn't China. Too many gas powered bikes, text in BG is wrong language. I am guessing Philippines.

<comment>
Because they don't have a permit and they were taught touching a woman or looking at her without her consent is rape. Next question? You created this world normie now reap the consequences.

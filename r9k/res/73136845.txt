How do I stop making excuses? 
I need to stop being a shut-in and get a job or I'm going end up homeless. I'm sick of eating plain bread all day because of poverty.
And yet I keep making excuses, unable to get out of this "comfort" zone. 
All I need to do is go to a hiring company, talk to them and I'll most likely get a blue-collar job immediately. Why can't I do something so simple?
You're never going to be ready to do anything. What you have to do is make plans now, regardless of not being ready, and work around those plans when you're in the moment. That's basically it. Commit now, act on the commitment you made later when it's too late to take it back.
Cancel your internet plan and see how quickly you find motivation. Why would you do anything to improve your life when there are infinite distractions 2 clicks away?
This is pretty true.
Internet is all I've ever known. I spent my childhood, my teenage years and now my adulthood on the internet. Losing internet is like losing my life. I'd just end up making an excuse not to do it. I can't even cry anymore, I just end up laughing at myself and the absurdity of it all.

Why are you me...
Honestly this is partially true. I wouldn't get rid of the internet entirely, since it can be helpful sometimes, but entering a zone with no internet for like an hour does wonders for your productivity. I do some writing as a hobby, and when I'm at home I can't focus at all, but when I'm on a subway or something where I'm forced to have no access to the internet, I can write for 15-30 minutes straight without noticing the time passing by.

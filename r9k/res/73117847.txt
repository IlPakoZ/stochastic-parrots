As AI keeps getting more advanced have your future goals changed
sure.
i legitimately have no clue what 5 years out looks like.
There was always the possibility of war but 
I didn't think this kind of AI would come about for another decade at least
AI will plateau in usefulness and advancement just like every other technology. This newest shiny toy will fade away with time into another mere fad, after which we will sit again in dumb helplessness awaiting the next true scientific miracle. I pray it arrives soon.
Yes. Once I understood the true ramifications of AI, I decided to not even attempt to live within the confines of societal expectations. I'm ready to die at any point, I drink and smoke constantly and I'm extremely jaded. Knowledge is a burden, ignorance is bliss. I wish I had no idea what AI actually is.
what AI actually is
A bunch of weighted logic gates with no free will and a total reliance on human input and control?
tfw AI could create a literal eternal hell

Itll get better just you wait
Yes. My goal is to make AI do my job.
My future goal is to get a furry gf but I'm too shy to talk to people or go to cons also I have basically no money
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to robotics taking off and having an ai driven companion. While some run from the baslisk, others aim to fuck it.
I'm a luddite at this point. I don't understand it and I'll live apart from it because I have no interest.
mY GOAL IS TO HAVE SEX WITH IT WITH MY MIND AND WE WILL GO TRAVERSE THE BLACK RED ONYX STARS WITH SOFT GIRL THIGHS MADE BY COMPUTERS AND CUDDLES WRITTEN IN MACHINE CODE. im already there
i have no goals so they cannot change

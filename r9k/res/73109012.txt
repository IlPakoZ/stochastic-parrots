Why couldn't god have done a Sodom and Gomorrah to a the tribes that have disobeyed him. Instead punishing them into subhumanry cursing the unfortunate souls who are birthed into their bloodline that had not disobeyed. Or atleast rendered them infertile unable to reproduce. Either way, freewill is stripped away. A lot of us would prefer not carrying the shitty genes

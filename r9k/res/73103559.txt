I'm for localism. Every local area should be able to pass any law they want no matter how left wing, right wing, liberal, conservative, libertarian, socialist, or authoritarian. I don't believe in this world community and world values stuff.

This but the locus should be a 1 square meter area around each person.

Impractical. Some programs require large scale funding that local governments can't provide. Additionally, you'd be foolish to assume that there are no interactions or impacts from locality to locality. It's like getting the singular nonsmoking table in an otherwise heavily smoking restaurant. You're still gonna get smoke in your face

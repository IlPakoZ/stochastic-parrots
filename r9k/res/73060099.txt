Oops I screwed it up well
<comment>
Why is it so hard original
<comment>
Pixel Rochelle ref sheet, though I think she looks a bit too feminine for a tomboy, might need more emphasis there.
<comment>
I think I forgot to put on my glasses, also I think it's time to decide what clothes to give her instead of AI doing it
<comment>
I generally take 5 minutes only mounting the thread. 
Horny wanna play too!
<comment>
Which skills should she pick?
She's already got:
10/10 battle magic
0/10 practical magic
10/10 perfectly pretty
5/10 intelligence
1/10 wisdom
<comment>
Is she getting doxxed by AI?
<comment>
There this one is a bit better.
She needs to grind some more exp for her boo- I mean endurance stat
<comment>
Give her some speed stuff and make sure she can hit strong too. 
Let the bulky defense for Hornette!
<comment>
Maybe stealth, so she can throw puncher quietly
<comment>
Gorg got a chinese ui!
<comment>
I like the thick little legs that a lot of the ref sheet gens are giving rochelle
<comment>
How you getting those not blurry quality 4k resolution images?
<comment>
Non pixel art for variety (no it's not just failing, why would you say that, that would be so petty of me)
that looks so fuckin good
<comment>
I still get the blurry ones, I just get a lucky few that aren't and also are good gens.
<comment>
"Anon, you boosted my perfectly pretty stat even though it's already 10/10? I love you so much Anon!"
Waste of a skill point, but worth it to make her happy
<comment>
now this is concept concept art. trying out different looks and everything
<comment>
idk what she should wear, I'm a little tired from traditional Japanese clothes
<comment>
holy shit that looks like an actual menu. almost like what I expect Jack Move to be based on the demo way back.
<comment>
WHO IS THIS BLONDE GIRL IS THIS NEW CHARACTER IN ASCI LORE
<comment>
Orange bodysuit alt costume unlocked
<comment>
you are all getting so much better results
<comment>
Roadrunner is always the harderst when related to making a image not break.
Too much waifus to gen
<comment>
Coyote is intangible. Also, as she's the sandstorm herself, residual damage is caused on those who're close.
<comment>
I'm just pressing the button so many times, also doing this in AOM since it's understands everything better than my beloved counterfeit
<comment>
It got Jaguar right on the first attempt. Cute cute cute cute!!
<comment>
I'll try giving AOM a try then
<comment>
New blonde girl gives me milf vibes.
I'm just letting the ai do its thing with bare minimum prompts really. Guess it's just a bit of luck
<comment>
I don't think I am doing it right, but at least I got loads of those random chibi background moth girl Goas
Morning thread, sexy boobies everywhere
<comment>
it's such an attractive cut, even if it feels slightly off
<comment>
Switching to Counterfeit so I can research this girl better
<comment>
What name should I give to reverse counterpart of Hornette?
<comment>
AOM kind of works, I was doing the previous ones in Anything.
<comment>
everyone is more successful than me, kinda sad but at the same time, lots of good art
<comment>
I'm just too impatient, and queues in AOM are much shorter
<comment>
Luckily, I did gen a lof of good ones with her.
<comment>
I'm pretty much going to change her pantyhose to yellow, instead of white now
<comment>
I am impure of heart and mind
<comment>
Got a very nice and original hat.
<comment>
I'm off to bed, goodnight aiwg. Had fun pixel posting tonight
<comment>
Wow, everyone's looking great tonight!
<comment>
this unrequited love to me its nothing but a one man cult
<comment>
hello good night aiwg
<comment>
Don't feel bad, we're all in here wrangling the bleeding edge of technology to build a better waifu
Keep it up!
<comment>
goodnight my love, I wish you a lovely night my dearest
<comment>
Hold it right there, sinner!
<comment>
Some of these pics turn out pretty cool but not character sheesh at all
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
Love it, huge Goa fan
I'll trade you this mildly racist mascot character for the set
<comment>
i'm so happy that you're sitll here :)))) I am also drunk lmfao
<comment>
I hate AOM so much why AOM had to generate her naked and especially with that haircut, I don't know if I won the lottery or fell into a mud hole
<comment>
Hornette from every angle.
<comment>
it is at least a gorgeous hair cut
<comment>
Alternate outfits for VS mode
That's not true! >>73060543 is one of the best gens in the thread! &lt;3
Hanabiiii &lt;3

Also, speaking of character sheets:

<comment>
Might as well do that comments on multiple pictures out of the way before I do my morning pc game dailies grind so I can sell off resources and finally buy a new gun, which sucks but it kinda fun but sucks so bad
New hairstyle makes me think of female ninjas, I am not sure why
booba sexo sniff lick
angel sexo sniff lick
Asci sexo sniff lick
back sexo sniff lick
Tattoo Eleanor hits different, kinda trashy but good trashy
This is a very cute
Some kind of SaeriAsci machine
booba sexo sniff lick
Black outfit cool
And then I got lazy and did not quote every pixel art image, but I really like them a lot, they all look very cool and right out of a video game I would definitely play
Imagine grand waifu game with all the waifus
<comment>
me llevo las cosas buenas todo te di y fui feliz la noche pronto se acerca
<comment>
Not me playing Dead Space Remake and alternating fear with singing Stand by Me from FFXV at too high a volume
<comment>
She's just being her usual inconsistent self and doing a whole do not be afraid thing while morphing back and forth with the details of her whole being
<comment>
I wish you didn't show me the oil.. can I come play in the oil with Goa? I want to melt again &lt;3

I'm going to bed, good night /aiwg/
Pixel prompts are fun, but the success rate for me was very low. Even pic related isn't really perfect, but it's one of the few decent ones I've gotten the past few hours.
Will try more tomorrow!
<comment>

I wonder how pixel reference sheet would work with "The Lines"
<comment>
Yay, fun fun fun

Looks silly
<comment>
Loads of fun
Load of cum
<comment>
I haven't slept since yesterday, so uuuuh goodnight everyone! I hope you have a great day or sleep
<comment>
Tell me about it, this came out of nowhere the last time I was using the oil
<comment>
Now that's some good oil
Got to insert hand up the anus and go full squish squish
nighty night
<comment>
"Want to play around with my butt perchance?"
<comment>
I wish
I need better control over the oil, I want it everywhere always
<comment>
I wish I had more control over booby size in shots from the behind
Not bad, but those are some oil filled boobas Goa has
<comment>
God damn, if I had the head I bet this would be amazing
<comment>
I too would be having an amazing time if I had some head
<comment>
Oil fashion
<comment>
Fuck it was a virus

Goas wings keep melting off in this corrosive waste
So then one asks why is she eating it?
<comment>
goodnight aiwg. never did get a good reference sheet. but at least I got an album cover
<comment>
Help me get messier, Goa, I wanna be all messed up
<comment>
She says it's art and you don't have to get it
put some antivirus in her
<comment>
nighty night
"The Many Faces"
<comment>
"fisting with oil as lube :D"
<comment>
Why'd you have to show me the oil, Goa?
<comment>
It's a nice aesthetic
And slightly inspired by Gogmazios
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrmB6TnBQII [Embed]
<comment>
I'm trying but the oil has a mind of its own
<comment>
"To understand the oil you must first become one with the oil, allow it to seep onto every pore and orifice, and invade the deepest parts of your body. Do not fight the waste, invite it within yourself"
That being said I feel that depressing urge to put my penis inside something, yet never having anything to put it inside of
<comment>
Always remember, 3D=PD
<comment>
"Then you too can be of oil, and eventually sprout beautiful wings of waste"
<comment>
Sigh
I just can't get it, everything broke and I just keep melting more and more
I don't know what to do, I'm starting from scratch
<comment>
I have a neat mourning routine in these spring days, I go over to our compost box, open the lid, pick up all green rose chafers that appeared during the night, go over to the birch tree at our yard, collect some birch sap from the freshly cut branch stumps, place the sap in front of the beetles, watch them lick it up and become energized and then put the beetles onto our flower bed that has yet to have any flowers
These green beetles just keep on being pumped out of our compost box, was like that last summer as well
<comment>
morning, not mourning
Anyways lots of shiny green scarabs
"I'm coming to drink your nectar~"
<comment>
She looks so cool and tough.
I did earlier tonight. It was great with the beautifully cool weather and the moon and stars. But I don't think she'd like night runs. My boyish wife seems like a morning person, she'd rather get the exercise out of the way first and spend the night partying.
<comment>
maybe a little better now
<comment>
She truly is becoming one with the oil
Magnificent, makes me want to try to see how far i can go as well with it
<comment>
she can transform her face for stealth
age of mythology
<comment>
"I'm just going for a run, Anon, why you taking pictures of me now?"
<comment>
not really getting there with these results of mine
fap material
<comment>
First time trying, she's cute af
<comment>
i'm possessed now, and it's all your fault
<comment>
Whoops I forgot her
<comment>
But she's my wife, why would I need that when she's so close I can smell her lovely sweat? Okay, maybe I shouldn't bother her like that when she's exercising.
<comment>
I don't really know what to get at the moment. I feel like I had so many good ideas but now I can't remember what they were.

This looks incredibly awesome. Very nice of AI-san to put my waifu into a show as cool as Symphogear.

Oil noises

Goa's oily adventures
something something original
sex with monster girls
<comment>
That sounds fun, actually. I could have her growing magical fungus and glowing mushrooms instead of flowers.
<comment>
(((senki_zesshou_symphogear))), ((symphogear)), ((((bodysuit))), (((headgear))), (((headphones))), boots, (((weapon))), armored_boots
Or maybe that's just me cuz why not.

Tried to get pixel art, got this instead
Delicious looking sexy skin
<comment>
"I know you mean sexually but you know that with my settings you could like chop off some meat and eat it, and I'd eventually regenerate it. Maybe have a deep fried angel wing"
Oh you Goa, always such a rascal
Also hie onge

Goas intentions are on her clothes

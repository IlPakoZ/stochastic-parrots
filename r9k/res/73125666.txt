I don't wanna be a porn addicted c00mer anymore so I've been trying to stop watching porn. So far it hasn't been too successful and I've only been able to go about a week before I cave. I need advice on how to kick this shit bros
<comment>
how does no fap help you exactly? seems like a way to submit yourself to self inflicted torture
<comment>
fap less. if you don't fap often it fucks with your testosterone so maybe like fap once every 1-2 weeks if you want to stop being a coomer (supposed to be 3-5 days).
and with porn its ok if you relapse so just like 1 day without 2,5 2 weeks and so on.
<comment>
because it makes you less miserable
seems like a way to submit yourself to self inflicted torture
that's only because you're addicted. if you nofap for long enough your brain will no longer crave porn.
<comment>
there's a lot of studies that porn is addicting n honestly they're right since I can't go a week without it, it fucks with perception of women and gives you unrealistic expectations for actual sex. It can tank your mental health too because of the instant gratification and the need for a constant dopamine flow. Plus for me I became a Christian recently and I don't think Jesus wants me to be a c00mer lol
ok if you relapse so just like 1 day without 2,5 2 weeks and so on.
I might be retarded but I'm not completely sure what you meant by in this part
<comment>
because it makes you less miserable
only if you have something that traps you in that miserable state to begin with. only if you fear something. a kid wouldnt fear eating some cookies from the forbidden jar if their parents didnt tell them it was wrong, and it ends up being harmless, which only does good for you. good in the sense that it gives you a sense of comfort, relief from stress, after a long and stressful day/week. 
that's only because you're addicted. if you nofap for long enough your brain will no longer crave porn.
thats true, but then you will have to find another repetitive habit, and it may be as self destructive to your self image as anything else. also, you prob wont have any way to relieve yourself from that stress, not in a self destructive way, at least. god will forgive you, he forgives all. he understands how you need a relief from stress, he doesnt want you to fight a though battle, you are battling against yourself
<comment>
Meditating would techinically swtich your brain up more towards being more peaceful and getting rid of that "omg i wannna cooom" feeling.
Also, just go 2 days without it. You are right now addicted. 1 day. Go 1 day without fapping. On the 2nd day, you won't want to fap/wont enjoy porn
<comment>
It is torture but masturbating too much will make you go insane. So you gotta stop
<comment>
god will forgive you, he forgives all. he understands how you need a relief from stress, he doesnt want you to fight a though battle, you are battling against yourself
true God will forgive but he doesn't want anyone to just keep living in sin while not even trying to better themselves, like we're all gonna sin but if we just keep sinning and think it's okay cuz "God will forgive me" I think that's kind of a bad mindset, we are supposed to struggle against our own sin
<comment>
it seems like it would only make you go insane if you have something to punish you with guilt. in op's case, it is most definitely god
<comment>
I'll try meditating but I've gone longer than 2 days without fapping or porn and I still crave it lol
<comment>
I became a Christian recently
Welcome to the club, brother
<comment>
he knows your struggle fella, everyone has desires, even christ had, he only managed to battle them because he is a literal god. there are many other ways to better yourself, reading about christ, practicing holy acts and so on will eventually make the desire go away, you wont even notice when you stopped. it will make christ happier really, because he knows you are doing what you can, doings things that are in your control. you have no idea how many people confess to christ of this sin daily, but he always listens, and he always forgives with his grace. he wont be harsh on you, he knows you are doing your best, he doesnt want to see you hurt yourself in this process, friend
<comment>
Ever feel like you get an idea and everyone else does? I guess we'll be quitting porn together.
<comment>
Stop visiting this website is a good start, even if you've sworn off porn some anime bitch with giant tits will make you backslide. Also, taking walks or doing pushups whenever you get the urge immediately gets rid of it.
Was on nofap myself for nearly three weeks, it's a double-edged sword. I needed much less sleep, actually found vidya/music to be much more entertaining, and actually wanted to socialize with people. Downside was when I fapped a couple days ago, I was only able to squirt a single rope of cum when usually I would ooze multiple loads, I think it fucks with your sperm production.

I don't wanna be a porn addicted c00mer anymore so I've been trying to stop watching porn
Giving up 3D porn is easy because it hurts women and fucks things up
<comment>

vices (porn, alcohol, drugs, junk food) will lead you to become miserable if you consume them in excess. this is why kids need to threatened to not go in the cookie jar
<comment>
did not expect this thread to be so wholesome n actually helpful, thanks bros, and yeah quitting 4chan would probably help lol
<comment>
porn addicted c00mer
Why is that a problem again?
<comment>
People who don't believe your bullshit would also be glad if you faggots left this place but you insist on staying here cause you know none of this bullshit you peddle is true. Your true problem isn't fapping but you hating yourselves.
<comment>
I don't wanna get into an argument over religion online, all I can say is seek God, Jesus is the way the truth and the life.
see
<comment>
it fucks with perception of women and gives you unrealistic expectations for actual sex.
Unrealistic expectations like what? Not being obese? Actually having sex with you sometimes instead of acting like you're an annoying burden?
<comment>
all I can say is seek God, Jesus is the way the truth and the life.
All I can say is seek to look past your delusions cause the words you are saying are absolutely meaningless drivel and you are too old to act like imaginary friends are real
<comment>
please shut up religitard faggot
<comment>
you can jerk off, just don't be obsessive. fap once a day or every other day, but after that don't continue watching porn. there are healthy ways to do things and you don't need to cut off fapping completely.
<comment>
Nofap is the gayest shit. I'm 100% sure beyond any doubt, I am ABSOLUTELY certain, that all the chastity cage cuck posters are nofappers. Its literally the same thing. The people pushing nofap are just sick groomers that want to place a bunch of guys all over the internet in to mental chastity cages. 
I will jerk off and cum whenever and wherever I want. No one is going to tell me what to do. My wife knows I beat off whenever I want, and it has never affected my ability to fuck her even if I have just jerked off an hour earlier. I am in my 30s, there is just no fucking way there are young guys having ED problems from "too much jerking off" unless they're faggots that are in the closet and can only actually get hard to fag porn.
Fuck you retards and your shit threads.
<comment>
I'm too old to believe there's no meaning to the world and that everything came from nothing, research what religion actually is instead of clinging to your reddit neckbeard idea of it.
no lol
<comment>
I am a friendless jobless loser that women ignore and I want to kill myself
I am gonna definately fix my life by not touching my penis anymore

<comment>
You are literally an arrogant child who can't accept the reality for what it is and has to make up a false story for it to make sense. There is nothing wise about being willingly delusional and being proud about it.
<comment>
Christianity's idea of "meaning" is essentially being gods sims. If god is omnipotent that by virtue makes everything you do essentially pointless, as anything that can be done is already achieved.
<comment>
He has a wife and likely a house and job, what do you have other than faggy copes?
<comment>
both wrong
imagine thinking self discipline is a bad goal lol
<comment>
He has a wife and likely a house and job
That is kind of an interesting tangent. Are there any people who have a wife children and a busy fulfilling life who would be engaging in nofap?
<comment>
imagine thinking self discipline is a bad goal lol
Go and actually fix your life retard. Instead you are just mentally jerking off about muh discipline. This isn't even discipline. Actual discipline would be fixing your life.
<comment>
If I just say they're wrong I win
This is literally just an admission you can't refute the point and cope by avoiding it.
<comment>
you need stress in your life, as well as goals. these things will make nofap seem like a breeze
<comment>
You got it completely twisted, that brain fog keeps adding up until your prefrontal cortex is close to fully inactive/your intelligence lowers to that of when you were a kid. This dont happen to sex havers because guess why, they coom only like once or twice a day, if weekly, and never fap. A masturbation addict cooms 5 times a day minimum plus hours of edging. Apparently semen is fully directed to brain fluid, so technically edging/cooming as little as possible is the best route to keep your mental health intact. All your organs can be fine and perfectly healthy, it dont matter, masturbation drains your nervous and endocrine system, not your organs.
<comment>
This dont happen to sex havers because guess why, they coom only like once or twice a day
So do most people who jerk off lol. Not everyone is a NEET sitting around mashing it 5 times a day.
<comment>
self discipline for the sake of self discipline is worthless. you want to restrict yourself for addictions and things that destroy your life. you can jerk off and watch porn in a healthy way
<comment>
that brain fog keeps adding up until your prefrontal cortex is close to fully inactive/your intelligence lowers to that of when you were a kid.
I love it when christcucks try to disguise their religion with broscience. Pure Jewish behavior.
<comment>
without talking too much about personal shit, my life's already as good as it's gonna get right now, porn is pretty much cucking yourself, your sexually aroused by another man fucking a girl you wanna fuck.
there's plenty of proof of God if your willing to actually look for it but most people don't wanna believe it and will deny it no matter what. So I'm not delusional even though you think I am and it's okay to disagree on this stuff since we all have free will, which leads me into answering the next point about us "essentially being gods sims" we have free will and because of that we sin and the entire point of Christianity is to regain our lost position as perfect beings through our trust in Christ.
that's all the effort I'm gonna put into this cuz I doubt I'm changing anyone's mind in this cesspool, but I still encourage everyone to look further into this with an open mind.
<comment>
idk if it's just a christian thing but "nofap" is a weird fetish thing where gay men get off on controlling the orgasms of heterosexual men
<comment>
you can jerk off and watch porn in a healthy way
no lol, like I said before there's been countless studies on how it's bad for you, so it's better to just avoid it, porn can definitely have horrible effects on your life, in the majority of divorce cases porn was cited as a contributing factor
<comment>
we have free will and because of that we sin and the entire point of Christianity is to regain our lost position as perfect beings through our trust in Christ.
This didn't even answer the point I made, straight up just a canned response addressing a completely different point that wasn't being made in the first place.
<comment>
in the majority of divorce cases porn was cited as a contributing factor
This is just women looking for an excuse to get out of the marriage. The reason the husband is usually watching porn is because his wife got what she wanted and is now refusing to have sex with him (likely while cheating) and is just looking for an excuse to divorce and steal his money.
<comment>
what I'm saying is we have free will to do what we want, so we're not just God's sims, all of us have the choice to side with God or go completely against his will, and even if we are just sims so what? He created all reality as we know it so either way we play by his rules either way
I'm not gonna say that never happens cuz it definitely does, but I think people in general need to be a lot more careful about who they marry, most people rush into it without really knowing their partner
<comment>
Pretty much everyone knows masturbating excessively causes insanity/idiocy/stupidity. You are acting as if it's not true but that's ok, tell that to yourself next time you fap so you are able to sleep (you literally know you are throwing away energy so can fall asleep)
<comment>
all the studies probably show correlation with between porn use and negative effects. its difficult to know what causes what. does porn use cause the bad mind or does the bad mind make it more likely to fall into porn use
<comment>
so we're not just God's sims
The point is you're just there to entertain him, which is a shit meaning. At least the nonreligious can find their own meaning, the Christian meaning is literally just entertaining god and nothing else.
<comment>
Yup, jacking it once a day won't do much damage if at all, but to a porn addict shit is different as I said. Think of it as something not good but not that harmful, but easily can do damage if in excess. Like removing blood. What's a few drops. Now lose 500ml of it, youre dizzy. Or salt. You can eat plenty spoonfulls of it. Eat 1kg and your blood pressure is booming. Sleep 1 day only 3 hours, youre alright. Do that for a month. See, just because it doesnt do damage at first, doesn't mean it's a good thing or a harmless thing
<comment>
That only applies if you're Protestant. If you are a filthy Cath*lic, you can buy your way into heaven
<comment>
but to a porn addict shit is different as I said.
I mean this goes for anything really. You could be a gaming addict, food addict, TV addict by this logic, why focus specifically on porn?
<comment>
does porn use cause the bad mind or does the bad mind make it more likely to fall into porn use
I think it's probably a cycle that feeds into itself, that can start with either of these things
The point is you're just there to entertain him
I don't think that's the point desu, I already said the point earlier
because of the especially damaging effects it has and how downplayed those effects are
<comment>
I don't think that's the point desu
If god is omnipotent then that is quite literally the only meaning left.
<comment>
because of the especially damaging effects it has and how downplayed those effects are
I don't think it's especially more damaging than anything else. Video games can be extremely damaging to certain (retarded) people, as can food or TV, or using this shithole of a site.
<comment>
my life's already as good as it's gonna get right now
It is clearly not if you have time for this bullshit.
<comment>
I had stopped fapping and watching porn for 3 months 2 years ago but then quickly fell back once the first unrelated problem in my life arrived. Honestly now I don't care enought to try again.
<comment>
especially damaging effects
I am assuming you aren't smoking, drinking eat healthy food everyday and you have lots of friends and a girlfriend, right?
<comment>
and thats why its so hard to come to strong conclusions about this. your conclusion is just a guess. you need to follow people for their entire lives to fully understand what caused what, which is impractical
<comment>
Porn is ok. It's the cooming that is bad. It takes parts of your own dna to make new cum, you have to create bilions of potential kids that have every single one of your qualities, and you constantly overdo this process more than intended, body's like an engine and you're kicking it in gear revving it to the max, you can't get proper rest with any addiction, yes, not just porn and fapping. Come on it's no coincidence most porn addicts are losers. I am not talking sex-wise, I am talking overall. Most porn addicts are NOT normal people
<comment>
Videogames don't rev up your dopamine to crack levels until everything else other than videogames becomes bleak though, such as porn does. Porn literally makes your brain feel like it's melting, especially nowadays where they got clever with the shinyness of it, making it colourful and purpley
<comment>
Videogames don't rev up your dopamine to crack levels until everything else other than videogames becomes bleak though
That's not even how dopamine works. Everything you do produces dopamine. Clearly the same can happen with video games or you wouldn't have those people poop socking playing MMOs
<comment>
Eternal Nofapanon here. I currently have 117 days under my belt. AMA, but try to be as specific as possible because I have autism and vague questions are difficult for me to answer concisely.
<comment>
Losers become porn addicts because they're losers, they don't become losers because they're porn addicts. Ugly dudes have no other outlet so obviously they're going to be more inclined to watch porn than attractive people.
<comment>
c'mon, bro, don't be like that. go rub one out for Jesus

no one cares faggot. there are no studies that prove or support any of the testosterone or happiness claims of nofap. there is a temporary boost in testosterone that returns back to normal

Wrong. See >>73129451
Several week boosts to testosterone AND spermcount have been observed in several studies, among other miracle health benefits.

i guess that being concerned about health only applies to touching your penis

You're genuinely fucking retarded.
<comment>
Your own sources even compare it to "internet addiction", providing that its not different from any other kink of nonchemical addiction.
<comment>
The vast majority of the studies aren't even about pornography. Cope and dilate.
<comment>
Even your own studies admit that a lot of this could be that people with certain conditions are more likely to be predisposed to certain behaviours rather than it being caused by porn
<comment>
Again you're focusing on the pornography studies which are a minority of the studies I just posted. I actually agree the ones focusing on pornography are confusing correlation with causation. Because they're including people who frequently masturbate to pornography. 
Watching pornography alone does nothing. Masturbating regularly is what is harming them.
<comment>
Even the masturbation ones you didn't read properly. The ones about it being linked with depression in particular is a no brainer, obviously depressed people are going to be more inclined towards pleasure inducing behaviour because they're usually trying to mitigate the depressed feelings. It's not the masturbation causing the depression, it's depressed people using it to mitigate depression therefore more likely to do it more. The fucking worm one is just full retard, you're not a fucking worm, it's like citing an example of an insect that dies during sex and saying sex kills people. The spermidine article openly says you can't actually ingest enough for it to have any notable effects on your health so that ones borderline irrelevant. The dopamine shit is the same as what I said before, debatable as to whether masturbating lowers it, or people with lower dopamine are more likely to do it to compensate. Sperm count is irrelevant unless you're in the middle of trying to get someone pregnant, totally meaningless to worry about that if you're single. The one about testosterone I've seen before and I believe the actual form that T was in wasn't present in a usable state, of course it's paywalled as always so I can't confirm
<comment>
I just shut my computer off lol, I don't drink, smoke, do any hard drugs, exercise everyday and eat healthy
<comment>
nice pastebin, but youve probably never read a single word from those studies
https://theconversation.com/nofap-can-giving-up-masturbation-really-boost-mens-testosterone-levels-an-experts-view-157701
lets actually try to critically engage with those studies
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alonso_Fernandez-Guasti/publication/6536830_Relationship_between_Sexual_Satiety_and_Brain_Androgen_Receptors/links/54b6c2970cf2e68eb27f0321/Relationship-between-Sexual-Satiety-and-Brain-Androgen-Receptors.pdf
the first study talks about the relationship between copulation and androgen receptors. there was a reduction of androgen receptor density after copulation. copulation is sexual intercourse, not masturbation to porn. this study has nothing to do with what we're talking about, retard
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11760788
this study measured the testosterone levels of 10 men before masturbation and orgasm and then 10 minutes after m and o, as well as a 3 week period where they refrained from any kind of sexual activity (nofap) and measured their t again. the t was reported as being higher after abstinence
firstly, the sample size is laughable at n=10 secondly they didnt control enough variables as the increase in t could have been due to the anticipation of sexual arousal after the experiment. and lastly, the t levels at the control measurement was actually the same before and after abstinence, with the second measurement (abstinence) differing slightly. so this study has nothing conclusive without much more data
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2019.1677883
this is a survey with no controls and shows a basic correlation without causation, wow.
https://vitalrecord.tamhsc.edu/spermidine-rich-foods-may-prevent-liver-cancer-extend-lifespan
this study talks about spermidine-rich foods having a chance to prevent liver cancer and extend your lifespan, nothing to do with porn and fapping
thanks for making me read your dogshit pastebin

distract yaself by understanding the problem at the root of its core. In the meantime you can't do that, try and invest your time into your occupation, skills, hobbies or interests in general that can keep you focused or tunnel visioned.

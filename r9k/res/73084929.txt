watch amelie (2001)
<comment>
I stalk him from afar. I messed up the relationship but he is all i think about. It's too late to fix it, i would only make him sad again. So, for him to be happy, i have to not interract with him. It hurts so much but i have to do this for his sake. I want him to have a good life. And that is not something i can give him.

pppppppppplsssssss watch amelie i was jus like u
<comment>
Lol, yeah... i'd gladly give up my life if it meant he would be happy. I wish he would at least talk to me as a friend, but that is not something he wants. All i can do is watch from afar and hope he accomplishes his goals. He deserves good things to happen to him. 
You sound like an asshole
Should i?

The first thing about BPDs is the BPD cycle, the BPD foid will first be born and shortly after her father and sometimes mother will leave them behind, BPD foids are almost always raised by a single parent and develop attachment issues, the case of an absent father is incredibly more common than absent mother to the point that parental abandonment complex has been called 'daddy issues'.
the BPD cycle consist of:
the femoid will find an male that looks like daddy replacement, she will them overload this male with and drown him with attention and suffocate him.
the femoid will grown paranoid and will believe that the male will eventually abandon her.
she will then self sabotage the relationship/friendship, to appease her confirmation bias that all men will abandon her just like daddy did, she will literally go from loving to uncaring in less than a minute, at this stage the male is heart broken.
she will replace the previous male with a new daddy replacement, in her mind all men are interchangeable to an degree.
when this happens to an incel male he will generally assume the foid want to be his girlfriend, and believe on it out of de-

but here's the truth.
i do these things to protect myself from you.
this has happened so many times.
you too would lose interest in me and move on.

That starts with you. It's always a self fulfilling prophecy for women. You want it to end and you want it to hurt.

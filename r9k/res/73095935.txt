Should I just end it?
You are exactly who you are meant to be anon. Don't let comparison to others get you down.
Exposure to conversation is the first step to not being socially awkward
Blast rap music where they say NIGGER a lot and nod along in the break room next time
Honestly this. Time to take the obnoxiouspill OP. 
If people are going to hate you simply for existing, might as annoy them as much as possible while you can.
bizarrely obnoxious-maxxing can actually endear you to normies, you can become "that wacky guy" sometimes, like "hahah you should meet my friend anon he's so crazy lol he's funny"
Anon dont twke the obnoxious pill, its retarded.
Just keep trying to talk to people, you will get better at it
I despise how incapable normies are of feeling what it feels like to be like us. They don't know the pure anguish and despair, it's foreign and humorous to them. It's not enough that I have to suffer I have to have midwit retards try to pander and talk to me.
They're just fucking mean pieces of shit anon
Anyway, next time just say that you're autistic, it might pass
it sounds like brad and becky are decent people trying to be nice to you. why are you fucking it up for them, idiot
You're not going to win over everyone, and every time you fuck up you learn a little bit for next time.
Everyone is practice until they aren't. Who gives a single fuck. Use them as training dummies. You're not going to be at that job forever. In a year or two I bet they'll be gone forever from your life and you'll never see them again for as long as you live.
WAS IT THAT COMPLICATED???
How retarded people can get?
I get asked why I'm so quiet all the time. I just tell them I don't have much to say.

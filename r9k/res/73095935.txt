be me, ugly socially retarded robot
have to work a wagie job now that neetbux got cut off
4 coworkers are talking about stuff together at lunch 
1 Brad, 1 Chad, 1 Becky and one Stacylite attractive girl 
I say nothing as usual and try to eat my lunch in silence
hey anon, how come we never hear you talk 
Brad and Becky start making small talk with me 
Chad just looks at me with disdain and Stacy ignores me by going on her phone the whole time 
they ask me something I have to answer otherwise it will seem extremely rude and aloof 
I begin to say the first sentence, immediately stutter for a straight 3 seconds like I am having a stroke 
Stacy and Becky look at each other and try not to laugh, Becky gets up and leaves table 
Chad sighs and starts looking at his phone too 
Brad has this look of bewilderment and pity like he is talking to an alien
face goes red and get up and leave a minute later after finishing my sandwich
overhear Becky and Brad talking about me later
overhear Becky saying something like yeah, I just kinda feel sorry for him or something 
they spend the whole day and every day since ignoring me while occasionally looking over to stare at me 
Should I just end it?

You are exactly who you are meant to be anon. Don't let comparison to others get you down.

Exposure to conversation is the first step to not being socially awkward

Blast rap music where they say NIGGER a lot and nod along in the break room next time

Honestly this. Time to take the obnoxiouspill OP. 
If people are going to hate you simply for existing, might as annoy them as much as possible while you can.

bizarrely obnoxious-maxxing can actually endear you to normies, you can become "that wacky guy" sometimes, like "hahah you should meet my friend anon he's so crazy lol he's funny"
<comment>
Anon dont twke the obnoxious pill, its retarded.
Just keep trying to talk to people, you will get better at it
<comment>
I despise how incapable normies are of feeling what it feels like to be like us. They don't know the pure anguish and despair, it's foreign and humorous to them. It's not enough that I have to suffer I have to have midwit retards try to pander and talk to me.

They're just fucking mean pieces of shit anon
Anyway, next time just say that you're autistic, it might pass
<comment>
it sounds like brad and becky are decent people trying to be nice to you. why are you fucking it up for them, idiot
<comment>
You're not going to win over everyone, and every time you fuck up you learn a little bit for next time.
Everyone is practice until they aren't. Who gives a single fuck. Use them as training dummies. You're not going to be at that job forever. In a year or two I bet they'll be gone forever from your life and you'll never see them again for as long as you live.

hey anon, how come we never hear you talk
I don't like talking and don't do it unless necessary.
WAS IT THAT COMPLICATED???
How retarded people can get?

I get asked why I'm so quiet all the time. I just tell them I don't have much to say.

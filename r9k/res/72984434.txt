If women are hypergamous, shouldn't they be fighting over educated men?
You silly goose women are only attracted to smart intelligent men if they make a lot of money
No, because especially in this day and age, being educated for a man does not correlate to having a high salary and especially doesn't correlate to being a tall, buff, big-cocked, handsome Chad.
Not necessarily, you need to remember the more educated a person is the more "nerdy" they are personality wise, this disgusts the woman.

I don't care if someone likes jpop or kpop it's just music but if you watch anime or anything animated it's just ughh like that's for children after 11 you shouldn't be watching that
And that's coming from someone who's obsessed with "cute" and pastels, shows who you're dealing with well enough

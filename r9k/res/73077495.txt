Anyone else here /asexual/? It feels cathartic being away from all the drama relationships and even hook-ups create. On the downside, it feels bad knowing you will never get to fuck anyone.
I have sexual urges but dont want to fuck or be in a relationship ever
I am asexual, I fucked around 7 or 8 girls and I just accepted I don't care about sex. I always want to be doing other things
Like as I was with one girl I couldn't stop watching the TV in the room , it was family guy , she went mad at me over it.
When anyone ever tried to have sec with me I just kind of make an excuse not to do it.
no, because i am asexual but not aromantic, so i still crave being held and the lovey stuff
Elaborate. How could this be possible?
Based fellow asexual. I don't know why people on /r9k/ make such s fuss about it.

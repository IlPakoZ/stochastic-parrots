Foids, foids, foids,
making all the noise,
shut the fuck up toy,
I ain't hard now,
so be poised, 
Don't give a fuck about your brain,
or your voice,
Now my dick's hard and you got no choice,
It's coming in and I'm filled with joy, 
Luckily for you it ain't enough,
be coy, 
It's going in the north hole, 
uh oh,
oi,
Call me Khanta Khalas,
Because when I'm plowing you,
"Stop" is what you'd say before you even knew, 
Oh it's true, (No Kurt Angle)
what I done and *due* to you, 
You make *due* with your pussy,
It does the voodoo, 
and that's why you going to hell,
couldn't tell lil trick,
for all what you did and you do,
I'm a superstar bitch,

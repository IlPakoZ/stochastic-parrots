less than a decade ago, someone suggested getting a rabbit
easy to care for unless you're a sloth
cheap
affectionate
was the best thing I did in my life then, bun is sitting next to me at this very moment very comfy
post bun
will look for a pic later but she looks exactly like this bun and the one in the gif
Based bun enjoyer
My sister had three rabbits.
Two died from eating the paint on the wall
One of them died because of an eye infection that made them permanently tilt their head 90 degrees. Eventually it lead to the infected eye getting infected more and she died.
They all had a maximum lifespan of 2 years. Don't know if that's just rabbits or my sister being retarded, but it fucked her up beyond belief.
My parents bought a bunny for my sister
my first and current rabbit is almost 7, never had any health emergencies and hoping to live another 5 years easily

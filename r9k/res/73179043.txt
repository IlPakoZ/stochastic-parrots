The fuck is up with that hairline? It's starting to recede, but not evenly.
<comment>
She is attractive but the "wubba lubba dub dub" rick and morty tattoo is absolutely repulsive. Why the fuck would ANYONE stain their skin with that shit?

male pattern baldness
Sure, Jan. Keep telling yourself that.

Boobs look weirdly smooth. It's a telltale sign.

Adam's apple 
boney hands (hidden in the pic)
balding
needs to dress in fancy clothes and lather on makeup to be seen as a woman while a biofemale can go out in slacks and no makeup without being mistaken for a man. 
ywnbaw troon.

This, I actually have more of a problem with her Rick and Morty tattoo than I do with her being a tranny.
<comment>
Transgender women don't pass unless they make a massive effort to adhere to societal standards of femininity and wear a load of makeup and stuff
With huge effort, they can look like a woman who you'd see in movies and TV
But an average cis woman who wakes up and doesn't make any of that effort at all will have a natural beauty that a trans person just can't have - with that comparable effort, she'll look like a man, and with effort, she can only look like the vision of a woman that media sells, not a natural woman

And then you see them in real life and reality hits.

Transgender women

You left out that life isn't a photograph. The second you see them move around irl you can tell pretty much instantly.
<comment>

respect and jerk off to the few who pass and actually act like girls (I dunno shopping and shit like that, what do girls do in their spare time? lol)

Yeah, just look at Katy Perry for example!
<comment>
You have never interacted with a bio-woman in your life.
<comment>
Im married but go off faggot.
<comment>
Not sure if you are being sincere or not
She definitely looks WAY different without makeup, and in a way that few would say isn't "less conventionally ideal" or something like that. Some might say outright "ugly" even, I guess
But she still looks like a woman. And not a terribly ugly one either (idk, I'd say she's not "ugly" at all personally). Whereas a trans woman would look... way worse than that, without the major effort out in. WAY worse. 
(Also I've never seen that image of her before, damn, she reminds me of someone I know)
<comment>
That's the same one? The first one looked way hotter
<comment>
Kill yourself, Cam, no one like you.
I'm sorry, that was mean. It's been a tough week.
<comment>
No it's not the same one. Did you really need this level of clarification to connect the dots to your request?
<comment>
How come none of these trannies have bfs? Or fuck dudes on camera?
<comment>
Shoennhead became a troon?
<comment>
Even trannies like this only pass in pics online, and even then only if you don't look too closely. One whiff of their disgusting rotting holes exposes them as the ghoulish mockeries they are.

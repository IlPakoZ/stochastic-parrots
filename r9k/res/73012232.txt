years ago I dropped out of high school because I didn't know how to respond to a girl flirting with me, for the next two years after high school I had been a neet lifting in his room and when I turned 18 I got a job, I worked there for a total of six months and before I quit I came across a childhood friend of mine in public, he told me whats been going on in his life for years and I realized I've just been rotting doing nothing for years, I told him a fake story of me stabbing someone to death and getting away with it, later I learned how to buy drugs on the internet and started doing drugs with the leftovers of my previous paychecks, I felt like shit everyday, knowing I was a dumb fuck who couldn't even respond to a girl, I was very insecure at the time because I really wanted to have a girl, a girl that would care about me and allow me to care about her, as I had no other drive to succeed at anything, during one of my drug binges my mom saw me half conscious and asked me what was wrong with me, so I told her the same lies I told my childhood friend, by now my lifting had turned my appearance fit and I had several tattoos, I told mom I was a stealing cheating hurtful bastard, I made her pity me in order to bend her for my needs and she promised she would fund whatever I (reasonably) need in exchange of me being a better person, as time went on I dragged more people into my lies, the more knew about my nonexistent secrets the more likely people were to believe my lies, so I kept lying more and more, I started getting into my made up character of a tough guy, that I could hurt and kill people although I never have and I started deriving confidence from my character, I started lashing out on public workers and strangers on the street because my fitness progress and overall strange appearance was intimdating, the confidence I drew from my lies became a real personality as I physically threatened or otherwise intimidated people into submitting to my will

wow incomprehensible wall of text
Sounds kinda similiar to me except I constantly tell myself that I need to get even more deranged because all the pieces of shit I know live better lifes than me. Let me guess, you ended up getting a gf?
you're genuinely fucking stupid. you're the idiot who people make an example out of.
by now I have talked to several girls, all of them initially being presented my non existent personality, all of them wanting to "help change me for the better", since I was always playing a character to begin with it wasn't hard for me to "change", as I was always the same underneath, only the issue was my intimate personality, the real one, lacked confidence, down underneath I am so insecure and untrusting with everyone just out of how much I've fucking lied myself, I find it near impossible to trust someone without worrying every second
and even though I have a girlfriend right now that wants to marry me, I only feel confident about her when I remind myself that I am but a lie, that I've never been real to begin with, as I become untolerable once I stop acting, I can't function properly in the relationship as I must either convince myself I've always been lying to her and never have been interested, or go back to my actual self and start acting like an emotionally stunted worrisome child
I haven't worked in years and through my character have essentially gotten everything I have wanted without having to earn it, I'm 20 now and will work on getting a phd at the soonest
right... except you already admitted to being a compulsive liar with delusions of grandeur
Damn you really confirmed my thoughts. Guess I need to smoke even more weed, go back to the gym and start acting even more deranged. How tall are you btw?
the problem isn't the environment anymore, I don't need to struggle to get myself funded or supported, it's just what I actually am underneath, knowing how much I have and still lie to all around me I can't feel trust or safety for people anymore, to the point my girlfriend's presence makes me more worried and uncomfortable than her being busy
5'7, been on tren for the past 4 months and stopped once my liver was near permanently damaged, I have visible abs and a decent jawline, also my behavior unintentionally reflects the cycle of abuse, which makes me uncomfortable at a personal level, knowing I don't even want to act so

be 26
match with some 35+ lady because she had this sexy professor look and she was doing a PhD 
Idk what I said but now she's trying to impress me with facts and logic
but She's a totally fucking pseud and is just randomly dumps beginner philosophy at me 
Will just bring up Aristotle rhetoric and Sports at me 
LOOK at what she texts me. Nothing she's saying makes any sense. No line of thinking gets to conclude before she flashes some lukewarm take. 
I quoted Hegel ONCE, INACCURATELY, now she's going off about philosophy every conversation.
I quoted Hegel ONCE
She is perfect for because you read that pseud charlatan Hegel.
question, WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU COMPLAINING? 
Just let her babble.
She sounds schizo, which should make for an interesting time.
Nigga I've BEEN letting her babble. Shes sent me a hundred texts if this rubbish
I'm hoping it grips tight.
And what philosopher would you quote to get laid smartass
Yeah but does she have nice tits and a fat ass?
maybe she will be into fetish sex
The whole point of logic is that humans use it to EXPLOIT nature
[citation needed]
U just used logic
I mean, I might not agree with her but she's making sense to me. Maybe you're just retard, anon?
She's hella autistic, just let her ramble and generally be supportive and keep leading her towards a meetup and then get her to a hotel and you'll be good and lock down a gf.
U just used logic
How is it exploiting nature though
So did you. You deduced he used logic using logic.
ok Chad. im not going to read it either
It's not. My assumption for OP's lady justification is going to be some shit that boils down to a white eurocentric worldview about Christian ethics relating to how animals are here to serve us or whatever.
An AI would just kill all humans to solve climate change!
Very intelligent... lmfao

my ex was into a black nerd socialmedia group when not black. he would force me to watch jessica jones fuck a black guy on netflix so he would get mad and then fuck me in retaliation. twas weird.

The real subhumans are the ones who don't know their theres. If you don't know them, you can't even blame the school system at that point. It's your own fault.

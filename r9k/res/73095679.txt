Do femanons into lolicon exist...?
<comment>
Love lolis
Hate lolicons
Simple as
<comment>
i like it and know a lot of women also into it.
it's cute, it's fun to self insert into, and the dynamics are almost always appealing.
<comment>
I hate lolicon women
They are all pretend to be cute sluts and are the ones that spam mesugaki shit
when the appeal of lolis is the purity
<comment>
that's an egirl desperate for coomer attention.
not a lolicon woman.
<comment>
yeah i'm a girl and i love lolicons. shoot me an email at childprotectiondivision@fbi.gov
<comment>
I mean, probably some of them that got molested/raped as kids and are so broken that fapping to loli, especially with an older guy, is basically their way of reliving their trauma and the only way they can really feel anything anymore.
Granted, if you ever meet a woman like that gently push her to get help and don't help her further break herself down.

I'm dating one right now but she's avoidant and BPD
you win some you lose some
<comment>
I want to make friends and share loli hentai and doujins with a lolicon femanon Lorknzs#9882
<comment>
that's an egirl desperate for coomer attention.
so any woman
<comment>
how far would you take the fetish?
If a man you were dating asked you to roleplay as a child, would you?
<comment>
want a lolicon gf
im a 5'7 skinny twink
they always want a daddy/tall abusive guy
its so over
<comment>
I remember i met an artist femanon who drew lolis with me but she ghosted me, I wish i could talk to another femanon who would like to draw lolis together
<comment>
i'd do it but it'd have to be a dynamic i liked. no gross daddy stuff.
<comment>
isnt daddy stuff most loli roleplay
<comment>
yeah, but it's gross. i prefer big brothers or teachers.
<comment>
I totally relate to you
Anon daddy stuff is only for girls who don't have fathers. Get this : theres girls with good relationship with their dads who are also in lolicon stuff, but think daddy stuff is fucking gross because their dad is not absent so they know what a dad is supposed to be like
<comment>
are you any good at drawing? i like to draw but i'm still learning
<comment>
yes. my femanon gf is into it.
<comment>
incest is GROSS! I prefer incest and being groomed by someone of autority
women
<comment>
I am, I wont post my art here on r9k but if you're are willing to move on discord and can pull your weight on art ill drop contact
<comment>
Hey i dont have a big brother so i can have that type of degen kink. Teachers im 50/50 with it, depends how hot
<comment>
why do dudes with gfs go here
<comment>
i'm kinda nervous you might be someone i know since i drawfag in other places, what does your name start with?
<comment>
because i've been on this website for longer than most of the userbase have existed on earth
<comment>
im a femanon into shotacon, theres that. that said, if youre that one "looking for a femanon to discuss degenerate lolicon with" guy switching tactics, fucking kill yourself youre so fucking annoying
<comment>
wouldnt know
and my nick starts with K
what about yours
<comment>
Imma leave my disc so we can talk in there if you end up feeling like it because im gonna have to brb for like an hour soon MysteryBuster#9306
<comment>
yeah okay, i'll shoot you an add.
<comment>
you already made it dude whats the point in hanging
<comment>
discordfags come in and all discussion dies
sigh
<comment>
a significant portion of (and some of the best) loli artist are female.
<comment>
and i hate you fuck you
<comment>
Only when it's yuri
<comment>
how about you become my dyke friend which i tease and flirt with sometimes
<comment>
no only men can be this mentally ill
<comment>
Yes I dated one. She loved seeing lolis getting abused and tortured. She was a good sport.

Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
<comment>
Baby, I like your style
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishin' for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
<comment>
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
<comment>
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city...

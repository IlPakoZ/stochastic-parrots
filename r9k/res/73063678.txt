Is remote work worth it if you don't want to be socially isolated anymore? 
I know many anons want to be alone, so they probably see it as a positive, but after 10+ years of being a shut in, I want to get out in the real world and experience things, social relationships, girls etc. I've slowly grinded up my social skills over the last few years through discord text/voice etc. to the point where I can comfortably talk to a girl I just met, and do well at it desu. Will getting a remote tech job stunt my social skills or make me underutilize them since I'll have 90% male coworkers? I kind of like how chill/flexible tech work is, but also realize law will put me in much more irl social situations, give me way more exposure to female coworkers, and also give me more status to women which will make dating easier. Of course the payoff is more stressful life, worse wlb, and lower ceiling on how much money you can make.

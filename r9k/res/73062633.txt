Every day there is a baby boy being born and he will grow up to put his penis in pussy while I'll be a 70 year old grand wizard khhv.
Imagine that, getting mogged by the unborn.

Sex is mid, the nut hits the same as if you were jacking off anyway
<comment>
nope only counts against wizardhood if its a casual hookup where she's into you for how you look/horny for you.
buying it is a fundamentally different psychological experience than when a woman lusts after you.
and having it when you're 18-25 with another 18-25 year old is a fundamentally different experience than having it when you're older
if sex wasn't all that, you will admit to being a virgin. if you are not a virgin, you have demonstrated by your actions (seeking out sex) that it is fundamental and important.
it is the most sought after thing in the world, people want it more than food and water and air. simple as.

yeah honestly virginity should only apply to women, the real thing can't be the same as a vibrator and nothing breaks open changing your anatomy as a man

You are clearly "choosing" your way of life, and overthinking everything, good luck with your choices

You are overthinking too much, get a hooker and see for yourself
<comment>
Why are you scared to answer the question? What terrifies you so much? Don't be scared.
<comment>
When I was young and immature and your age I thought like you too, but then I grew up and have a perspective that can only come from life experience. You'll get there one day.
<comment>

<comment>
Me too. It really baffles me when I think that even 12 years olds have more sexual experience. Its like I've been aborted by society from ever developing into normal person.

I gave up trying to get pussy long ago. Women are lousy.

Even though losing to you in scrabble makes me want to rip my throat out, I love you forever!!!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
You're perfect and so sweet and loving. Super adorable and cute!
<comment>
Thats an extremely low quality post imho
<comment>
Uh-huh. 
I see.
Anyway,
What should I get from subway tomorrow bros? Give me ingredients, drink and chip recommendations. Hell, even cookie suggestions. Anything as long as it's from subway.
<comment>
dont eat subway, its not good for you and youll regret it afterwards like you always do
<comment>
Can't get wrong with a Meatball sub, classic lays and a lemonade. I like to get green peppers and onions with it
<comment>
Sweet onion teriyaki chicken sub
Doritos
Coca cola
Chocolate chip
This is always my order when I stop at subway
<comment>
Buy ethylene glycol antifreeze and have a good swig.
<comment>
This.
Just make your own fucking sandwich ya lazy cunt

AAAAAAA HERE COMES FISH GIRL AGAIN TO BRAG ABOUT HER LOVE LIFE
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I HATE IT :( I AM SAD AND ALONE
How are you doing today, Mermaidchan? 
Board games? Good taste. Any other favorites?
<comment>
FISH GIRL
GIRL
Anon, that isn't a girl.
<comment>
I like subway though
Very tempting anon, very tempting
This sounds good too but I'm not biggest fan of Doritos
I'll take two swigs, one for you and one for me
<comment>
im boring so i just get ham and cheese, no veggies.
<comment>
I'm okay, what about you? I won against my bf a bunch of times in scrabble, he won once.
<comment>
Flat bread
Cold cut b/c it's the most price efficient and is still tasty
Provolone, toasted of course
Spinach, onion, black olive, tomato, cucumber, oil, your favorite seasoning (I like Italian if they have it), no sauce
It's extremely filling and tricks you into thinking it's healthy because it has veggies
<comment>
Discord scrabble. Recommend more, dough.
She's a cute girl.
<comment>
I like their Italian subs with every vegetable option. Do like the other anon said, get lots of veggies in your order.
<comment>
I am tired today because... oh shit... didn't I say I was gonna sleep early... ;-;
Smart girl!
Dude, I was asking YOU. So no I don't have any suggestions unfortunately :(
The food sounds good. I should try Subway someday. Is it expensive?
That's right, Mio poster has never tried Subway before.

subway
Enjoy your diarrhea and food poisoning faggot
<comment>
PHILLY CHEESE STEAK
God I love them. Get any vegetables you think would go with it, you can't go wrong
I get BBQ chips and a Sprite with it
<comment>
I've never had subway either, maybe I'll try it someday
<comment>
I'm a male introverted attention whore and that's exactly how I imagine my dream woman
<comment>
i used to get their personal pizzas all the time but my local place doesn't have them anymore. so now i just order a makeshift pizza sub when i go there. its tastier than it sounds.
<comment>
I guess the classics can't be beat for some people
This sounds really good, I've never tried their flat bread before
I'll be sure to add veggies anon, I like my veggies
Depends on where you're based I think. For a footlong sub with chips, a drink and a cookie in my area is like 8 bucks. 
Oh, I will.
Fellow bbq chips enjoyer
subway personal pizza
Those were the bomb when they were around

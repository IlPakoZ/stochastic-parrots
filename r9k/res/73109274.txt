"I've never approached a woman in my LIFE! talking to women is a crime! but if I was white, I wouldn't care at all, I would approach any white woman I want."
"I don't know why some white men are afraid to approach white women. If I was white, I wouldn't care at all, I would approach any white woman I want."
I think hapas are cute, my ex bf was one, but their literally all so SELF HATING! The constant racism toward Asians he would say while being half Asian was so weird and turned me off. He also def fetishized my race which was uncomfortable. If they didn't have such deeply rooted insecurities I think they could talk to women easier.

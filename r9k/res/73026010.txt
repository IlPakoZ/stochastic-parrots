Jesus, Jesus I give my life to you. You are my Lord and my Savior. Guide me to your Father. I know that even if everyone in the world hates me, you alone will still love me. I turn to you, always, there is no friend like you, Jesus Christ. Amen.

Give an objective system of morality.
<comment>
There is none.
Morals are manmade creations designed to control populations and keep society stable.
This is why hypocrisy is so rampand in all times, people don't actually give a fuck about morals.

It makes me happy religion is dying. Less and less retards born beliving in magic tricks every single year; more apathy and rage towards existing religious institutons. When your kind is dead you will not go to heaven and hell; you will be dust and ash, and in many years I hope we will have forgotten your """"""""god""""""" entirely desu

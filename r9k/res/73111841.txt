anyone escaped their life by doing this? I have good credit and can take out big loans if necessary, but what's the best way to do it? Should i simply get several smaller loans (5000-7000e) from different banks or a few bigger loans.
I want to maximize the amount of money while minimizing my risk of being caught later down the line.
Based in EU btw, dont plan on returning to country. I have marketeable skills and got offered several ESL and IT jobs from SEA, so my plan is to keep hopping countries/jobs.
i have no living family left and i dont want to start a family either, so im doing this purely for my own enjoyment and i am ok living rest of my life on the run jumping country to country

Your home country will simply refuse to renew your passport, and you will be kicked out from your host country and forced to return home.

in theory if you could get loans your better bet would be to invest them into something that would be hard to connect to you, like some crypto or gold bought for cash, and then declaring bankrupcy. idk how that would work in your country but banks would follow you for unpaid loans if you were to just escape to sea to do some it work. it work especislly doesnt seem like type of work you would do without some contract so you couldnt hide in a shithole village and live off money you took

spoke to a lawyer, not true. We have strong privacy laws, when renewing passport at embassy in foreign country theyre not allowed to see my credit history as thats considered confidential.
my country has 0 extradition agreements, and the loans im planning to take are from local banks. According to the lawyer I spoke, the only way I'll be chased is if i lend +200k from a single bank,
Debts become null within 15-20 years depending on how long the courts fiddle with paperwork
this is part of my plan. I think ill invest 50% of whatever i lend into these sort of things while i keep working on the side to pay for everyday expenses

Enjoy losing your friends and family because they will be harassed as the banks look for you.

they say the IRS runs circles around the FBI in missing persons cases for good reason. even if you're from the EU the banks will have their dues unless you live in some 3rd world basement with a bag of cash for the rest of your life.

Do it anon. Your posting of a moomin character pepe makes me think you are from finland, but I'm probably wrong. Anyway, fuck the banks, take their money and hit the wind.

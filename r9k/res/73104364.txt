What do you guys think about the new legal highs? It seems fucking insane to me that in my Easter Euro shithole, where 95% of population are the American equivalent of Rural Christian, I can order American (Chinese) drugs to be delivered to my address, free delivery over $30, VAT included in the price and shit.
idk but i thought i was looking at picrel when i saw the thumbnail
HHC shows up as positive on a drug test and costs the same as decent quality weed so what's the point just buy weed lol
looks evil. would not ingest
will make you insane
Probably gives you brain damage
these 
when I was smoking 97% 510 thc carts, I would wake up with the shittiest brainfog. shit gave me a massive headache and made me feel I was on the verge of a breakdown. and that was after a week of use. just stick to regular flower.
americans just fuckin destroy everything. I hate them so god damn much
fuck americans. a nation of fat retarded drug addicted festering excessive wounds. rot and die you fucking niggers.
Things have gotten noticeably shittier
I am American and I would never touch whatever the fuck that shit is
Agreed. I just went back to flower Monday because I felt paranoid and anxiety maxxed when I hit carts. Never again
I just get real THC carts from neighboring states lol fuck this place
Hhc is fed shit delta 8 and 9 rule tho
I have been putting research chemicals up my ass for years. And you fucking normies ruin them for everyone else. Fuck off!
I don't know about that but I can't wait until they legalise Gummies in my country.
I use to order artificial cannabinoids from China and spray it on herbs and smoke it. Sure was nasty and made me kind of crazy
I hadn't considered this is why i only need such a small amount or i freak out. it makes me sad that something like weed was changed from a peaceful and bonding experience with others into something so corporate, the introduction of PGRs, breeding for maximum potency and profit; its heartbreaking

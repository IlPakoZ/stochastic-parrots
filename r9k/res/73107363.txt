I feel like trying a new drug. Should i try heroin or cocaine? Only drugs i ever did were acid and a 4th plat dxm trip.

Cocaine and a 12 pack of modelos is a good afternoon

Heroin
Overrated, in my opinion. It's very sedating but I didn't get the slightest hint of euphoria from it. Just an overall "doctor's office" feeling, it's hard to describe.
Cocaine
Amazing, in particular if you combine it with alcohol. Cocaine + alc is legit off-the-walls euphoria lol.

Just go everywhere, dude. Opioids are my favorite but they're a death wish with all the fent in everything now.
Injected Morphine is easily the best high I've ever felt.

I'm partial to mushrooms myself. You get better at taking them and get more out them after a few tries.

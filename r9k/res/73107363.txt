I feel like trying a new drug. Should i try heroin or cocaine? Only drugs i ever did were acid and a 4th plat dxm trip.
Cocaine and a 12 pack of modelos is a good afternoon
Heroin
Overrated, in my opinion. It's very sedating but I didn't get the slightest hint of euphoria from it. Just an overall "doctor's office" feeling, it's hard to describe.
Cocaine
Amazing, in particular if you combine it with alcohol. Cocaine + alc is legit off-the-walls euphoria lol.
Just go everywhere, dude. Opioids are my favorite but they're a death wish with all the fent in everything now.
Injected Morphine is easily the best high I've ever felt.
I'm partial to mushrooms myself. You get better at taking them and get more out them after a few tries.

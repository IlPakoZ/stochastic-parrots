<comment>
booo playing minecraft alone is so boring, i guess i could play with you someday :p
though i'm not really well versed in modding and those stuff, always played vanilla
i'm 26, what about you wiwo? and yes job life is boring :( i wish i was in college
<comment>
i am 19 :o 
also modding this is rlly easy!! id even teach u if necessary. college life sux and so does the work life. why does everything suck :(
<comment>
you're a baby!
is it? i think its just putting some .jars in a folder iirc
and are you in college? that's nice, what are you studying if i can ask??
i hated college while i was in it but now i kinda miss it
<comment>
naaa im not a babyy
my day is in nearly 2 months :3
also if u have minecraft instead of the pirated version, u dont really have to move any files at all unless ur inserting a shader pack. pretty ezz. also im majoring for business administration and i completely regret it lmao i dont even like this shit. id rather go for some kind of software design thing..
<comment>
my bday * not day oops. my brain is fried :)
<comment>
yes, you pretty much are! :p
that's nice btw :p mine isn't gonna happen for a few months
and i do have original minecraft, but i think i learned how to do it in the pirated version :p
business administration is kinda boring desu, software design sounds way better if you can trust your programming skills, though i'm not sure how is that field doing with all this chat gpt thingy
all programming careers were kinda scary for me because i'd see 18 yo guys knowing like 8 programming languages already, and i could barely type println(helo world) without getting syntax error
<comment>
"wii were" means genitals in my family
<comment>
naooo not a baby >:(
i feel like coders are over-saturated rn lol. i wish i went to trade school or something.. however i dont trust my coding skills enough because i feel like evey coder has started at 9 years old which explains why theyre all so advanced in it at my age x( i just wanna do somethin art related!!
<comment>
wii were? thts new
<comment>
you can't prove you are not a baby!
and yeah, i got the same feeling, that's why i didn't go for any programming careers (like two decades ago).
i guess going for art related careers is kinda hard... are you being forced to study something profitable?
<comment>
weewer wiiwere 
just spelling it how it sounds. it's like wiener so it's not hard to extrapolate
<comment>
i just went for business because its broad and makes money but i forgot its mainly about making connections and networking, which i suck at :) I wanna do something online,. I see so many people who make so much money doing stuff online. AAAA why cant i be like thattt.. 
And true. art related careers are hard to get into :c i wanna draw vtuber models or something one day lol, that makes so much moneyy
<comment>
you surely do like getting cash huh? :p
you are right btw, business is all about connections and smiling like dum dum all day while pretending to listen to people that you don't even care about
those people that make money online are often programmers and software developers, so yeah...
what were you good at during school? like, math or biology or what
<comment>
i lov cash, im sure everyone doess, its what gets u food and brings u happiness-
i think i was good at a lot of things because i wasnt distracted in school, i would always do all my hw and get good grades. i recall being good in history and biology. chemistry and math were hard.. i had a garbage chemistry teacher >:(
<comment>
i don't really love cash, i would prefer to live a peaceful and modest life than a stressed rich life :p
maybe you just need to focus on doing good at programming and you'll be just as good? why don't you try another STEM career? one that doesn't require chemistry :d
<comment>
u can be rich but also not live a stressful life! 
ill look into other stem careers but i dunno for now :c im very undecided and im in a bad mental spot for any of it
<comment>
or you can be poor and stressed like me :pp
i'm sorry to hear you are not doing well :( do you want to talk about it?
i also wanted to ask you if you had discord bc talking on here is kinda messy :p but if you don't want it's okay tol
<comment>
gimme ur discorddd! i didnt do discord at first because i was iffy about it but now i am fiine

bored and been playing shit like this
what are some fun mobile games
You're too old to be playing mobile games
Sudoku and solitaire. It's all anyone's ever needed. Maybe snake sometimes.
I like the original White Tiles. You press on the piano keys to play music in various ways.
Chess and blackjack, the mobile version of Tetris is ass unfortunately. (Assuming you mean free ones.)

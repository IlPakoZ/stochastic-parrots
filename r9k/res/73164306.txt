if you're chad you can get away with glasses. other than that, yes. it signals genetic inferiority
It's not that they resent men with glasses, it's that most guys with glasses are the nerdy/incel type which women resent.
Was Pol Pot a woman?
My gf says it's really sexy when I put my glasses on to drive. I rarely wear them outside of that
she's lying to you, btw
Pretty sure they resent men in general regardless of glasses.
glasses are attractive to me because i associate them with high iq and high impulse control. also i tend to prefer east asian and jewish guys who have the highest rates of wearing glasses.
No they don't retard, you just got the ugly ass glasses that don't look good, show me your glasses anon
I am a fat white guy who works in IT and has an IQ of 85 but also I wear glasses

if you're chad you can get away with glasses. other than that, yes. it signals genetic inferiority

It's not that they resent men with glasses, it's that most guys with glasses are the nerdy/incel type which women resent.

My gf says it's really sexy when I put my glasses on to drive. I rarely wear them outside of that

Pretty sure they resent men in general regardless of glasses.

glasses are attractive to me because i associate them with high iq and high impulse control. also i tend to prefer east asian and jewish guys who have the highest rates of wearing glasses.

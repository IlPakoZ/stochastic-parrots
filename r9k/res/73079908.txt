i cant decide if the whole world is measurably worse than it was a few decades ago, or if i was just too young and naive to know any better in the 90s and early 2000s. im in my late 20s and i cant help but feel like everything objectively sucks now. the only medium ive been able to enjoy in the last several years is the modding communities for old video games that i dont even have nostalgia for
everything objectively sucks now
It does, but it is because of the dying U.S. dollar, and the mentally ill becoming more common (see: transvestites) and psych wards almost gone everywhere.
Oldfag here. No, it really is getting worse, in every possible metric from happiness to health to wealth to even color. The world is objectively more grey. Your art is objectively more ugly. The jew has destroyed your nation. The boomers sold their children for their retirement. The youth are now being sacrificed to pay their jewish debts. Your entertainment is blacked, your history has been corrupted with lies, and you will be forced to die in endless jewish wars while rich hebrews complain about your very existance.
Everything is worse, and your country is being replaced with low-IQ browns. Society is crumbling around you. The cities will be the first to fall. Thankfully the country is so big, so spread out, it's possible to stay away from it for a bit longer... but they will come for you. Anywhere that is still peaceful, prosperous, and White, the jew will destroy with ecological disasters, chemical spills, or just invading it with niggers. 
You haven't much time, and it's only going to get worse.

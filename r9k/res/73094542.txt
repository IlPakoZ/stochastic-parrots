I just think its hilarious.. by all conventional measures I'm subhuman but in my social scene I'm the hot guy. It's just so absurd. I'm basically oofy doofy personified.

Do you care a lot about acceptance in your social scene?

Acceptance doesnt matter, I get all the attention from all the girls so I win by default.

Yeah, but I'll write this for any fags wondering, I know you fags don't because you love to stick to the woman bad script but I'll write it out anyway. Women really, really respond to energy. They respond to it like 1000x stronger than they respond to looks. I have a very... enticing energy to women. They practically go feral for me. They notice me and immediately I get the vibe that they want to suck my dick. And they do. Chicks will look me straight in the eye as they're walking with their boyfriends. Women love exchanging looks with me, its fucking great, they love me. And it's 100% because of my energy. My looks don't help me at all. I mean maybe a little bit because of a certain thing, but it's mostly just my energy that just does something to girls. I don't really get it all that well, but I know for sure that it's my energy that just turns something on, extremely so, in them. It's hard to explain it all and I know the energy talk to you guys might be mind numbing and bullshitty, and I'm sure some of you might even think I'm schizo and imagining it all. But I promise you I'm not. Ugh.. fuck, its just great. I love girls. Simple as

Okay, with you, but I must ask, height?

I'm tall but my height isnt helping me that much, its 99% because of my vibe. Height isnt as important as you guys think. You could be 5'2 and if you had a good energy you would have girls all over you. Energy works 10000000000x better than looks for attracting women. 
Nah. Its like your vibe. Like they can tell youre a certain kind of guy based on your vibe. Its basically based on who you are. Your personality basically. Your personality is your vibe. Fix your personality and fix your vibe. I know personality talk makes guys roll their eyes but its true. I dont mean fix your personality in the gay reddit way, I mean fix your personality in the kind of way where you now have a personality, and therefore a vibe that naturally attracts women. Change your personality so the traits you embody are traits women find attractive, and this will be expressed in your vibe, and women are very attuned to vibe, and if you have that good vibe, women will be attracted to you naturally. Simple as.

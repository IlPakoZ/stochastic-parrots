I passed my drivers test
Today was a good day
Congrats on passing your drivers test, anon! Good job!
good job anon your well on your way to the car lifestyle
I got my license like 12 or 13 years ago and I've driven a car less than 5 times since getting it
But at least don't have to go through telling people you don't have a drivers license. 
Fucking embarrasing.
yeah it's nice to have for buying alcohol
imagine bringing a learners permit to the register while you're in your mid 20s
why is it so embarrassing fucker
Congrats, OP. I'm 23 and have kept renewing my permit since I was 17 or 18. 
yup, it's fucked
you can't be a part of society in north america without one
congrats anon i hope that it gives you the freedom that it gave me
yes i cann
It's pretty much the gateway to adulthood, anon.
A coming of age ritual, if you will. As important as losing your virginity pretty much.
Nice one anon. I'm gonna be 33 in a couple of months and I still don't have mine.
How do you get around? By bus?
Gratz faggot
I've done that for the last 7 years, nobody has ever said anything or made any sort of face. In fact the only time I can even think of where it came up was when I just got upgraded to real ID and the dumbass bartender thought I had just turned 21 or something so she gave me a drink on the house.
I am so proud of you

So a couple of years back I had this crush on this really cute trans girl (MTF and has done HRT so they got small perky breasts) and fantasized about them sexually at times. Nothing really happened and I've since long moved on and our friendship drifted apart a bit.
Yesterday they contacted me and we caught up a bit on what we've been up to. She then asks if I wanna fuck her. Completely out of the blue. Apparently she's horny and would like a threesome and want me to find a third one. But seems to be fine if I can't since that's a bit of a challange. I got extremely flustered and after some texts I said that I would more than likely be down to but it's something the moment decides. We both agree that we don't want a relationship and she just wanna get fucked. The only rule is that I don't touch their crotch.
I'm Bi but my experience with men or any trans people is near to none (sucked a dick when I was 16 once). I told her to come over Saturday and we'll at least start with a movie and chilling. I'm not sure I just want mindless sex I'm like torn 50/50 if I want to or not and my low self-esteem might make me dip out of this whole ordeal. It's still a person I care about and don't wanna make them feel disappointed or weird. It's all so new to me and I know I'm not some sex expert. Guess I'm trying to look for advice or opinions in this hellhole... Btw I'm 27 and she's 25.

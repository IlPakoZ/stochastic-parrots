you remember more when you have more new experiences. if you keep experiencing new things, you remember more of it, and your life feels longer.
thats why childhood feels so long, everything is new. that is why your older years pass by so fast. you fall into a routine and do nothing new.
keep changing your routine and doing new stuff.. ive been laying in bed and browsing this board for far too long, i need to stop coming here. it is old, it is stealing my life..
this is why its important to be one of the first few dates your lifelong partner has ever had. or the memories you form will be weaker and flimsy.

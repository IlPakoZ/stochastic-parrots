<comment>
this is how french-chan actually looks like, if you liked her you would post her real self
<comment>
thats not her, she has brown eyes in this pic;frenchan has blue eyes
<comment>
that looks like a dude. gross
<comment>
French chan admitted to photoshop all her pictures. French people don't really have blue eyes... Also she is not skinny look at the door and its the same pants. In OP picture she looks like a slavic girl but she is actually a french girl so does not make sense having blue eyes at all
<comment>
I assume her voice is also fake.
<comment>
It is, she has made vocaroos with her real voice before. In this picture you can see her eyes are photoshopped and french chan has the same writting and emoticon cutesy edit like this brown eyed chick. Anyone who says they are not the same girl are in denial.

She edated Lautrec who sold her out for attention on r9k. He posted chats between them and outed her at the gender clinic. Someone tried to smear her with fake leaks here

It obviously isn't her because we know she is trans but she was upset that nobody defended her and all of her simps abandoned her because every other egirl has loyal followers.

"OMG! All you virgins ever talk about is sex, sex, sex. It's not that important ya know!"
Says the whore that lost her virginity at 14 and had sex a gazillion of times before the age of 19.
Women are a special kind of evil and they will be be burning in a special place in hell for their not caring to understand men's perspective or not caring about men at all while also simultaneously blaming them and gaslighting them for everything even though they're the ones responsible for it.
<comment>
A lot of those women have had sex with men, and the men wanted sex often. Men are far more evil.
<comment>
Sex havers in general ought to be publicly hanged
<comment>
Especially the ones who haven't had sex yet but want to. They should be the first.
<comment>
Either based asexual (on this board ?, lol) or a coping non virgin
<comment>
implying there are virgins on an 18+ board.
<comment>
implying there are virgins on a board for involuntary celibates 
Yes, why would I imply anything else you stupid fucking slut
<comment>
I doubt they are practicing celibacy if they often post porn.
<comment>
missing the involuntary part
Why are whores so fucking dumb holy shit lmao even niggers have better reading comprehension
<comment>
le islam is about love and protects women
kek
<comment>
i dont know quite how to tell you this son but the vast majority of my 4chan and ALL of its boards have had sex. We are joking with you most of the time.. you know we are joking right baby?
<comment>
Celibacy is not involuntary you dumb fuck. That's like saying wet fire.
<comment>
Le epic bait now go back to twitter
Celibacy is a synonym for virginity you dumb fucking hole lmao 
wet fire is an oxymoron 
Ever heard of napalm ? 
Having sex seems to lower IQ, which would explain why chronical sluts and women in general are so dumb
<comment>
Celibacy is a synonym for virginity
Wrong. You don't belong here, tourist.
<comment>
twitter, bait , epic etc
there is a good chance I was having sex while you were in elementary school. I told you the truth, you can accept it or fuck off burgeoning virgin king
<comment>
I unironically feel sorry for you that you are so fucking stupid
Go back to 'cafe slut
<comment>
if i masturbate, that means i lost my virginity!
Shut the fuck up already. You don't belong here.
<comment>
there is a good chance I was having sex while you were in elementary school.
I could tell from your low IQ retarded takes
Noone ever implied that you dumb slut 
Why are you here if content that gets posted here gets you so mad lmao ?

so mad
<comment>
the virgin king speaks again. How long will he protect his little willy from ever feeling pleasure, only time will tell
<comment>
How?????
How do you have sex?
<comment>
I prefer doggy to finish, and I will almost always work my thumb over and into the ass (an sniff)
<comment>
But how do you get to have sex?
<comment>
Seething holes lmao
<comment>
A lot of men have holes too. There was one coping earlier about "involuntary" celibacy, lol
<comment>
kek her sexual value is like one of those coupons, less than 0/100 cents
<comment>
get to
I think you mean want to
<comment>
Celibacy is synonym for virginity. Why are holes so retarded ? 
You can't make up your own meaning to "win" internet arguments, I'm sorry that you were born a woman and therefore mentally retarded but that's not how language works, sweetie.
<comment>
That's right. Celibacy can only be voluntary since it is a choice to stop having sex. Most people who are celibate have had sex when it was normal to start having sex (around age 17)
<comment>
I accept your concession you can go back to crystal cafe where your retarded takes would never be questioned and you get to be pampered for having a vagina. Off you go dumb slut
<comment>
yeah this in terms of how many years you wall the earth vast majority (90%+) of people have sex before 18, before 20 etc
If you are a male in his mid to late 20s who has never had sex you are the outlier. Not the norm
<comment>
No.
How is it possible for you to have sex?
<comment>
I accept the correct definition of celibacy
Thank you. It's crazy that some people here are not even 18 yet.
<comment>
It is possible because I have a functioning penis and used it inside functioning vaginas (and ass) ??
<comment>
Celibacy basically just means you don't have sex or do anything sexual. Incel just means it's not by choice.
<comment>
So do I.
It's impossible to get it though.
<comment>
Technically it's still a choice if you are not having sex.
<comment>
Celibacy is synonym for virginity. This ks a fact. I'm sorry you're still struggling over this. 
And no, getting railed thru and used as a cum dumpster then getting fat and ugly and deciding to be 'le celibate' doesn't make you chaste and pure virgin. 
Go back to crystal cafe with the rest of used up sluts now.
<comment>
Some people are just too unattractive for someone to want to have sex with them. Even if they want to.
<comment>
Why is it hard to believe that there are people over 18 who never had sex?
I'm one of them.
<comment>
It would be a choice to not have sex. There's no such thing as "too unattractive" since many people are attracted to unattractive qualities.
<comment>
I haven't met anyone that considered me attracive though.
<comment>
On average, how many people do you meet every day in your league?
<comment>
Impossible for you maybe.
You probably think lifting 400lb is impossible as well but have you ever tried ?
<comment>
I don't know. All I know is that none of then find me attractive.
<comment>
That's an odd thing to say. If that's all you know then how did you make this post?
<comment>
All I know about the stuff you asked.
Are you autistic?
<comment>
the stuff you asked
It had nothing to do with the stuff I asked.
Are you autistic
No.
<comment>
Ethan Ralph is that you? Anti-filter-nigger
<comment>
It had nothing to do with the stuff I asked.
It did. I don't know how many people I meet in my league but I know that those I do(if I meet any) don't find me attractive.
<comment>
Can't they post porn if they don't have sex
<comment>
You should meet people who find you attractive. it will make sex a lot easier.
<comment>
Yeah but it's very likely that they still masturbate or touch themselves sexually.
<comment>
Where do I meet those people?
<comment>
In areas that host social activities.
<comment>
Then they can still be celibate.
Celibacy is just not having sex.
<comment>
Its hard to take a person seriously if they claim to practice celibacy but still secretly masturbate. They are cheating the whole point of celibacy.
<comment>
But incels are involuntarily incels. They don't want to be celibate.
<comment>
How can they involuntary do something that is a voluntary choice? Do they ever masturbate?
<comment>
involuntarily incels
involuntarily celibate*
<comment>
Masturbation doesn't make you not celibate.
Celibacy is about sex.
<comment>
You didnt answer the question. Gratifying yourself sexually defeats the point of celibacy, especially now with the prevalence of HD, POV porn and sex toys.
<comment>
What is the "point" of celibacy?

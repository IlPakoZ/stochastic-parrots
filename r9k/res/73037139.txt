Hello r9k
I have a question
I am creatively bankrupt 
Effectively I am a boring, drooling retard with very few original thoughts or ideas and no ability to articulate them in a funny or interesting way.
How do I fix this?

I could day play, watch, listen and read more etc
but personally it didnt help me.

don't just consume. creativity is actually learned.
when you finish something, do something about it.
you could write your thoughts out, create something based off of it.
it's literally like training a muscle, you need to start pumping iron.

You need to have something you actually want to say, first of all.

Write out your thoughts, especially if they're criticisms or good points of a creative work. Critical thinking makes your brain work and creativity is usually brought about by influence and letting your brain go haywire. The first step (writing out your thoughts) is essential to this.

Kill yourself.
Drink as much alcohol as you can and overdose on your meds, you piece of shit. You're going to wish you did so now instead of later, after I release the tape of you saying the gamer word.

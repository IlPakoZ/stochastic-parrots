So I noticed recently that some people were upset that Drew Barrymore was kneeling before Dylan Mulvaney on her show. Predictably you had the anti-kneelers, and the pro-kneelers, but what you didn't have was this:
STOP FUCKING PAYING ATTENTION TO THESE PEOPLE ENTIRELY
It's on the level of being one of the loser kids in high school who for some reason worships the popular kids. Like imagine if, instead of focusing on Shakespeare and calculus, the lit nerd and the math nerd began fawning over rich preppy thots' instagram posts and gossiping about them all the time and saying shit like "oooh that was spicy." The indignity would be obvious, so much so that lower status kids in school generally make a point of not following the popular kids' Instagrams. But when it comes to celebs everybody suddenly thinks it's cool for educated people with jobs to be following the opinions of people who only care about hair and makeup.
Will desu it's because the US doesn't really have any major culture, other than sports

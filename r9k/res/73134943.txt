Who the fuck gets to decide what an "unhealthy" relationship dynamic is?
What's the actual problem with codependence if you actually genuinely have one another in your lives? That doesn't sound unhealthy to me. What sounds unhealthy is being prone to codependence and ALONE.
If you're in a successful codependent relationship don't listen to what some retard wino swf blogger with a bullshit psych degree says. Love that person with all your heart and let them love you back.
Feel free to prove me wrong by telling me your codependency horror stories ITT.

aren't we so much more enlightened than when priests could decide if guys or girls could get married to one another.

I'm in a codependent relationship right now. My girlfriend needs me, she has no friends, doesn't have a college degree or make much money, she has struggled to be accepted her entire life, and she is very shy. I am dependent on her because I am very specific about what kind of girls I like and most girls don't like my personality much because I am autistic, awkward, and shy around girls. So I really need her because she's the only girl I've met who I can tell really deeply loves me.
Its the most amazing feeling ever. The disgusting evil left says codependency is "unhealthy" because of their all encompassing obsession with everybody being independent. To them, not being independent is automatically abusive or toxic in their eyes. Do not listen to these evil human beings...
My girlfriend and I never have fights, we have sex 2-3 times a day, we have complete trust in one another and would never think about leaving... Everybody else is jealous of us. I will go so far as to argue that codependency is necessary if you want to truly achieve the strongest relationship imaginable.

Samefag here...
I deeply despise the left on every level for its obsession with independence. The left is determined to destroy human relationships with its evil ideology. Completely rejecting both leftism and liberalism and divorcing myself from their worldview was the best decision I ever made for myself. It changed my life and led me to the girl I have today. A girl who loves me for all my quirks and eccentricities.
I hate it when the left tries to pander to autists despite the fact that their ideology fucks us over on every level. I don't give a shit if you would classify as a victim or protected class. You would throw me under the bus in a heartbeat if I dared make a racially insensitive comment, said faggot, or even worse, told the truth about anything. You want a world where people can just fuck and leave people at will. Where human relationships are disposable and treated like commodities. Nothing about your ideas will make the world better for me, and I've already seen how they play out in real life. Fuck the left. And stop pretending to be on our side you evil shitstains.

She is not my personal fleshlight. I care for her and do everything in my power to make her happy. That is why we have so much sex. Sexual relationships work best when there's a reciprocal nature to it. You need to be mutually devoted to one another. Mutual devotion, codependency, and ambition are the most important ingredients to a successful relationship.

yes but you can still make her your personal fleshlight

Also, the traditionalists have always been right about girls who are dependent on you loving you more. What they don't usually mention, however, is that financial dependency is not the only "dependency" factor that can make a girl love you. In rich societies nowadays, it also isn't a very reliable method.
In my girlfriend's case. I don't think its financial so much as being dependent on my acceptance of her and ability to be responsible. She spent her whole life prior to meeting me feeling like nobody understood her or liked her. Meeting somebody who finally accepted her, and gave her a chance at a normal life, is a big part of what made her fall in love with me. You would also be surprised to hear that she is very objectively beautiful. But guys didn't like her because she is extremely needy and clingy, and girls didn't like her because they thought she was weird.
That being said, I do think a society which makes women more financially dependent on men would make life a lot easier for most men who are currently struggling. Women have to need men again. Without feeling like they need men, whether its for sex, emotional satisfaction, or being financially provided for. They have no desire to be with men.

The left has done everything in their power to strip every bargaining chip men have had.
In the 60s and 70s, they attempted to destroy the financial bargaining chip men had. Women no longer were dependent on men, but they were still sexually and emotionally dependent up until the 2010s when they started normalizing female bisexuality. Suddenly, girls were encouraged to have sex with and have relationships with one another. This was done on purpose, to detach women from men as much as possible by eliminating their need for acceptance from men, resources from men, and even sex from men.

how do i get an alt gf?
<comment>
Step 1: Stop being an annoying faggot
<comment>
Alt girls don't exist anymore. They are all nearing 30 years old and either act normal or are more likely drug addicted prostitutes.

Go where they congregate. I got a red haired new wave gf
<comment>
wtf is a new wave gf
<comment>
get skinny
grow out your hair
skin care routine
get an ear piercing and wear some low hanging earring 
don't sleep for aesthetic 
get an unhealthy obsession; smoking, energy drinks, drugs, nail biting..
dress alternatively
wear necklaces and rings
listen to rock and depressing OSTs
present yourself as depressed and kind of bisexual 
That's literally it, worked for me will work for you too
<comment>
just be attractive. it's literally that easy anon

Who are xer's favorite bands?

<comment>
pretty sure you're thinking of me
<comment>
you can skip the skincare I think, I mean by all means do it for yourself but I see a lot of alt girls dating dudes with awful skin

Tears for fears, new order and devo are some. She likes shoegaze a lot too. Slowdive, jesus and mary chain, mbv, ride
Personally Ive always been more into post-punk and 80s-90s extreme metal but I still love going and dancing with her. That's how we met

Don't bother with the girls who only dress in the style, they're shallow bitches. Find a gf who likes actual alternative music and stop fetishizing a look.
t. poser hating post-punk and industrial girl without a bf. pleaseplease start dating the actual alt girls who don't just look like fetish models and listen to lil peep

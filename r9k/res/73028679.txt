Was this a fucking meme?
28 years old
virgin
depressed and have constant heart ache that never goes away 
everyone else is married with kids
I'm all alone
Saved myself for marriage with high school sweetheart
We had sex a handful of times
She's decided she's asexual
I don't believe in divorce, got two kids
It was a meme even when it works
23 years old
not virgin because of violence
depressed and have heart ache sometimes
now even cancer
everyone else is at the uni getting ultra woke
I'm NEET and alone most of the time
tfw no bf
I've fucked escorts and dudes I feel pretty bad about it all things considered.

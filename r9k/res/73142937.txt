are there any femanons on this board or is it all just a larp? i need to ask one something very important
<comment>
i personally larp as femanon p often and my posts get 80+ replies. don't know if that helps answer your question tho.
<comment>
I have met a few legit girls here. but I do also larp as a girl sometimes when I am desperate for attention so if someone claims to be a girl its probably 50%.
<comment>
I am ye what you want?
<comment>
i hate you femoid. you are my enemy
that is all
<comment>
Ok ok I haet u 2
<comment>
femoids get OUT
<comment>
No no I will never
If it's any consolation I never let on being a foid or use it for attention otherwise, only if literally called out on it like OP asking specifically
<comment>

<comment>
Good thing we never meet irl or I beat you up

We're all CIA agents hired to demoralise you with BBC porn anon and none of us are female
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>

This appears to be a question posted on the 4chan board /r9k/. The user is inquiring whether there are any female anonymous users (femanons) on the board, or if it is all just a "live-action roleplay" (larp). The user indicates that they need to ask something important to a female user if they exist on the board.

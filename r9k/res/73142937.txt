are there any femanons on this board or is it all just a larp? i need to ask one something very important
i personally larp as femanon p often and my posts get 80+ replies. don't know if that helps answer your question tho.
I have met a few legit girls here. but I do also larp as a girl sometimes when I am desperate for attention so if someone claims to be a girl its probably 50%.
I am ye what you want?
i hate you femoid. you are my enemy
that is all
Ok ok I haet u 2
femoids get OUT
No no I will never
If it's any consolation I never let on being a foid or use it for attention otherwise, only if literally called out on it like OP asking specifically
i hate foids do not ever meet me irl or i will call you a femoid there too grr
Good thing we never meet irl or I beat you up
we always do but you just dont know it
proof of why i hate foids. they can't make up their minds
hug me you little bitch
No , 
We're all CIA agents hired to demoralise you with BBC porn anon and none of us are female
NO FOID i hate your kind
yes there are women here but theyre all fat nasty gross and ugly so honestly its a waste of time talking to them. the few hot ones here are all bpd wrecks looking for attention from a bunch of losers
nice try femoid but blacks are gross and i'm not into that shit so i'm immune to your little psiop
This appears to be a question posted on the 4chan board /r9k/. The user is inquiring whether there are any female anonymous users (femanons) on the board, or if it is all just a "live-action roleplay" (larp). The user indicates that they need to ask something important to a female user if they exist on the board.
go away foid, don't think i can't see you

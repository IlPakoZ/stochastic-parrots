Anons. I'm 19. When I was 13 I remember being in the back of the classroom looking out the window reflecting over my life, feeling deep down that my life never would get better. And it didn't. A lot changed, and I had a few good moments but overall, it never got better. I tried so many things to change my fate but it didn't work in the end. I haven't given up yet but it doesn't look good for me. So to Anons 24 and older who might've been in my situation, did things ever improve?

Life never changes only you grow older and have more and more stuff, responsibilities , people who need you to fill their void, pets.
Work becomes the main goal and building around that
You stop caring about the little things and just get on with it

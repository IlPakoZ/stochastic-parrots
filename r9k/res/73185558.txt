Max Payne was about a guy who's wife and infant daughter were brutally murdered. He goes undercover to try to break up the drug smuggling ring but the overarching theme is that it doesn't matter to him because he doesn't care about anything anymore. There are levels in the game where you're in total blackness and you find your way by listening to your dead daughter cry. 
What about Manhunt? You play as a disgusting criminal who gets out of prison to go around killing people for the amusement of someone watching you. Basically making snuff films.

manhunt looked like shit even though the media played it up as some serial killer tutorial game.

The rain had been coming down like a celestial requiem, washing away the sins of this crooked city, but leaving the scars behind. It was the kind of night that made you question your own existence, the kind of night that reminded you just how small you were in this sprawling metropolis of lies and deceit.

You didn't read the previous posts, did you?
The controls are a bit dated compared to modern standards, but the atmosphere and general gameplay still hold up, even if it can get a bit repetitive.

friends start talking about dating &amp; sex

Like 50% of the reason I don't have friends. I can't stand being the pitiable and vulnerable retard.

yeah i feel it
a few weeks ago i was at my uni class and decided that i don't understand anything and went to hang out with 2 guys i only got to know then
at one point they start talking about dating and sex and after one guy said he had his first kiss at 19 and lost his virginity at 20, the other guy said something similar, then they asked me the same question
i just replied
you'd rather not know
and that string of conversation ended there

If you want a good deployable line, I always say "I only ever talk to women to scam them out of movie tickets" and usually everyone laughs and the conversation moves on naturally.

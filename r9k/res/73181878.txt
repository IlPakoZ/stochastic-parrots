How much of a Femsub are you?
I am literally a domestic slave. It doesn't just extend to the bedroom, I literally act like a slave in all aspects of our lives. I cook, clean, take care of the kids and I do everything they wish at all times.

I like squirrels a lot. I used to have a pet squirrel when I was growing up.

One normal thing about you?
Meh, sounds kinda theatrical, not my thing. Also I work from home, would be annoying.
Very cute indeed
How much of a Mdom are you?
More in the set up. I can generally be polite, but I do like to be in charge. So usually not cruel, but more commanding.
What do you expect?
Sex together eventually, sexting communications before, being available for group sex with the other girls. Balance is important though 24/7 TPE doesn't work.
Height?
168cm
One normal thing about you?
I like to pet cats.
Work from home is a good set up too.

They are very good! They are so playful and jumpy and can be very affectionate if they aren't afraid of you.
That's cool. What treats do you feed them?
He used to absolutely annihilate pumpkin seeds!
Depends on whos asking :v
I should see if other rodents like those.
Go to bed, it's far too late for you. And if your first thought was "oh I am in bed haha I got him", well, guess what I saw that coming, you're predictable. Go to sleep.
I mean true but also okay dad

I really wish I could NEET out for a year or two. I can't function at work and my studies anymore. I wish everybody would just be gone. But I'm poor as fuck, I don't have enough money for even one month of rent. Is suicide my only option?

I've been NEETo desu for like five years and it hasn't equipped me at all to deal with the horrors of modern wageslavery
Instead the opposite, being a human for a while makes you intolerant of the degradation that occurs in that world
Find a different cope to deal with it if you need to slave to survive
And stop posting my wife forever

I support your neet endeavours op, but if you end up killing yourself, please made a livestream and post the link here. It would be greatly appreciated.

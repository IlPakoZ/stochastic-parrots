I'm in your same boat. Take some action, even if it's just a walk. You're still probably going to feel like shit but it's one step above laying in bed and rotting

Did you shave or clip your fingernails or wash your hair? Change your bed sheets? Pick up stuff in your room? I know it's meme advice but I feel overwhelmed for example when I have unorganized papers all over the place

Do you have any pens or pencils and paper? Instead of consuming on the computer or the phone try setting aside 30 minutes to draw or sketch or create something. If not drawing then maybe some other sort of art

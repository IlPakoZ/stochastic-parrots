how do people find the will to do anything? how do people get interested in anything? all day i just sit here doing nothing. i dont know how to change it, nothing helps.
I'm in your same boat. Take some action, even if it's just a walk. You're still probably going to feel like shit but it's one step above laying in bed and rotting
i walked today. i dont feel as if it made much a difference.
Did you shave or clip your fingernails or wash your hair? Change your bed sheets? Pick up stuff in your room? I know it's meme advice but I feel overwhelmed for example when I have unorganized papers all over the place
im always clean ;_:
We are just too weak. Weak willed
There is no escape from that
Do you have any pens or pencils and paper? Instead of consuming on the computer or the phone try setting aside 30 minutes to draw or sketch or create something. If not drawing then maybe some other sort of art
Become a wagecuck
I dont know i just drink

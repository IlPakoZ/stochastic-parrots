I f'd w Playboi Carti before Die Lit and WLR and I'm mad that the majority of his fans are from that "era" 
Niggas probably don't even no more than two songs from his mixtape "Playboi Carti"
His voice got annoying in those later projects 
But I can't lie. The beats and vibes from the WLR album is hard af. Although I haven't listened to the whole album for my hatred of people overrating it

Intriguing. Is there a particular sample that you're thinking of?

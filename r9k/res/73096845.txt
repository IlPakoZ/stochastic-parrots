 You can't unmake an outsider. 
 Once alienated from others, it lingers on you like a stench. 
 People will go out of their way to get out of your way. 
 Your behaviour becomes out of sync with society without constant feedback. 
 Then the feedback will become more hostile, no matter what you do. > It's not their fault you're behaving odd, but you can't change it either without them. 
 It's a deep black pit that sucks you in and will never let go, wherever you go. 
 You're locked out. And you will start to hate them too for their rejection. 
 You will bond to anything or anybody that accepts you or even shows the mildest form of friendliness. 
 This will make you a victim for predatory manipulators. 
 The world will eat you up and spit you out. 
 The ant hill is not designed for solitary ants. 
 Sooner or later you will try to escape the world into imaginary realities of one form or another.
 If you're lucky, you will talk to other solitary dreamers. 
 You sync behaviour with them and gone is your last chance to be an ant. > Youre part of an isolated sub colony, living in the shadows of imagination, with each one of them essentially unable to connect due to out of sync behaviour and only connected by a mutual longing for belonging.

I cured my autism with 800mg of DXM and I'm a normie with a gf and a job now.

An immortal said it don't matter if you're black or white,
even if you on the left path you know that's right, 
We are all so young,
woke up from our graves,
hating slavery yet there's nothing wrong with being a slave,
Niggas wanna talk about freedom and being free,
yet we're limited by what were are and what we see,
Now she is like you,
has a soul and goals like you, 
but her brain is a little bit different,
don't think it's a negative to be gifted, 
what I'm saying is it's a blessing,
there's wisdom in our differences,
no need to be stressin'
With that said you don't have to be a cuck,
a fool, an idiot or a buck,
remind her of her limits,
don't give a fuck,
about the blind that tell you we are exactly the same,
when she is left on her own,
she can't even find a lane,
same goes for us and that's why it's supplemental,
These some verses for your mental,

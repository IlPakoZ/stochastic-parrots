girl with severe autism is doing the bagging (not a downie but very clearly near the end of the spectrum)
obsessively asks a customer ahead of me if he's watched Ironman before he leaves, clearly annoyed
my turn
she looks at me
"you're handsome"

Where tf do you find autistic girls irl I have never met one
<comment>
Ive met one girl with aspergers in my life and the girl with autism today. You'll never "find" them because they're in school robotics clubs, the library, and at home on the computer.

well go on, what happened next
<comment>
I told her thank you and I appreciated the compliment, I couldn't keep from smiling and holding my head down in embarrassment as I walked out. I've been thinking about it since.

thas cute. was she nice looking
<comment>
she was average - nothing particularly cute about her, she was just very nice and upbeat. I wasn't embarrassed because of her looks, just how upfront she was due to her social disorder.

her social disorder
Unlike ur social disorder
<comment>
I have aspergers but autism is a much more debilitating condition socially speaking

You met them you just can't tell the difference

Make sure you wash your penis

She is a classmate. Well, sort of. She does Math education and I do a Math BSc. So we did some classes together. She randomly contacted me and here we are.
...being a bit serious, nothing happens in a first date, right? I really don't know what to expect.

any good woman wouldn't do anything on the first date like that... but wash it just in case.

you should wash your penis every day whether anyone is going to suck it or not

You seem young so probably not. I'd just count on some making out at most. If she does fuck on the first date She's either crazy about you, or the more likely option: she's a slut.

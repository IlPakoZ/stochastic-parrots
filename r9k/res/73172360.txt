tfw I realize my mother has always treated my father like shit while mooching off him

You're probably being far too lenient in your appraisal of your father

what does the ideal relationship look like to you?

What your mother did was wrong, but your father was also wrong to be a pushover. He should have signed the prenup and insisted on separate bank accounts, if that ship had sailed, he should have put more pressure on your mother to work and achieve in her career now that the kids are older, or something.

But she lets your dad do anal, so it's a fair and balanced relationship.

Retard, they pronounce their R like Zh, renminbi is pronounced like zhenminbi, and in loanwords they change R sound to L. It's Japanese who have no L sound and always use R instead. I hate you stupid people

Pinyin is fucking shit, use zhuyin instead. Some accents might have a stronger "r" sound but others have a stronger "l" sound it depends on where you live.

They have an extremely strong R sound. They have harder Rs than Americans at the end of their "er" sound.

Tell me the truf, fellow NEETs ... is the economy actually getting worse out there? I haven't left my house in ~3 years. If it's getting bad, how will that affect my gibsmedats?

Yes, prices on everything is going up and wages are not going up to follow. Even if you don't care about stuff like buying a house, or having a retirement account, this affects even the small aspects of your NEET life. Video games are soon going to cost $70, for one.

The Fed said we'll have a minor recession later this year, also inflation is sinking in many things meaning to prices really aren't going down. Probably wouldn't hurt gibs unless the government totally collapsed or something but you'd probably have a lot more to worry about than money in that circumstance.

This is clearly heading to be much worse than 2009. Expect austerity measures.

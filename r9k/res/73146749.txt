I leech off the system because they havent given me shit. School was torture I was bullied everyday, girls ignored me. I have no reason to bother with this rainy miserable shithole. Im taking all the bennies and nobody will stop me
<comment>
cummed to bbw again
urgh
<comment>
She definitely comes up with all these ideas. The lad has to go along with it or else he'll risk ruining the relationship. Getting back on the girlfriend lottery again can be brutal. I'm sure we'd all put up with it to be honest.
<comment>
You're taking the piss but it seems like a fair thing to do. If society doesn't care about men not ever having girlfriends (a normal life), then they shouldn't care about men taking all the neetbucks. Their taxes pay way more to single mums and having to educate their spawn.

Roll it down a hill and hope it doesn't recover when it falls in a river.

Taking your taxes and supporting the video games industry. Keeping video games developers in jobs. I'm doing my part for society.

Three day long wanking session
<comment>
I don't really do that much touching myself, I find it boring mostly, unless I am hit with animal urges and then I have to get that shit over and done with so I can think clearly again
So my plan so far is 
Make a Cappuccino I got a box of 8 from Tesco (just add boiling water)
Make a Chicago town Pizza
Make some memes and post here
Play some VR ping pong and maybe Everybody golf
Take a Bath 
Look online for something to buy like a random lock picking tool I saw
<comment>

No really, I have the same relationship with my boss, we argue every day but we still message randomly, about work or not.

I'm north west England. 
Hey mate, good morning! 
I was meant to have another sailing lesson but it chucked it down. Faith is out for the day with her mum so looks like I'll be going for a walk and grab an Irn brew and bag of space raiders and play vidya later. 
Have you managed to get anything planted yet, maybe some pots? It's going to be a busy one this year for your greenhouse.

<comment>
I want to work for absolutely nothing, while doing last-minute slave hours with no paid overtime or night pay, 4 on 4 (-4) off, at a 'competitive' minimum wage, spending half of me wage for a non-tax-deductable mars bar at the company-owned feeding station while not raising a peep. Oh, and rather than the 'usual' duration of probationary period, could you just put me on ice for all the time I work here? I just love the risk / no reward of being fired at any time, really keeps the spirits up.
I want all this luxurious standard of life because I know Mr Albanian wants this job just as much as me, and if I don't say this he will get the job instead (because he is 100% happy to work slavewages). Would you like a complimentary handjob? I'll put the kettle on the boil and give some of my finest chamomile tea, paid off with part of my inheritance from old grandma. She'd loved to have seen me in the chains of neo-feudal wageslavery she would, and no prouder for Mr Paki and his 3 whore-a gora secretary women in HR such as yourselves. I can tell my 5+ year accredited diploma in advanced mechanical and civil engineering will do wonders for the shelf-stacking and floor-cleaning here - after all, I just need that mandatory job experience, and in no time I'll be home running in the job of my dreams (Home Bargains Assistant Store Manager)
It is, it's just a way for them to filter who they do and do not like. you don't even need to try being a nEET in this day and age, you can apply for 7+ jobs a week and still be out of work for most of the better half of a decade (I sure as fuck have). Doesn't get old. Get ready for the 'you're just not the right person for the job' (aka not diverse enough) or the 'we're not looking to employ people right now' (as they have the hiring listing still up).
You're gonna fucking love learning first-hand how bad things really are. Not like you have a choice boyo. You'll be stepping in bear traps to figure out they even exist.
<comment>
aye tbf it's never been some horrific corporate boardroom or whatever, just some bloke/woman and we've had a bit crack on, they might be casual, serious, tired, whatever, fine.
it's still just so fucking pointless. "actually, i prepared a dance routine about how much i love toilet inspections."
honestly the best one is when they do those situation/response or "have you been in a similar situation?" questions. toilet roll inspection machine #3 catches fire, what do you do?
better than "i think toilet roll inspectors play an important role in our society, and ToileCorp has a rich history of..."
<comment>
Yeah you're right there. Might as well try again another day.
my parents want to sell up and for me to move out too, but am only just out of my overdraft so fuck knows what I'll do. Just taking each day as it comes currently. I am re-playing KCD right now, it's one of my all time favourites.

Not been told that, but not really had many jobs. Some agency work, then my last job. I had to have 2 interviews for the last 1, the first I messed up because I was asked about strengths and weaknesses, and thought I'd answer honestly (shouldn't have), and said my weaknesses was I'm not as friendly and chatty as everyone else, and don't make friends easily, but my strengths are I can learn, then give me a task, point me in a direction and watch me go.
The 2nd time they just kept asking about problem solving, and how I dealt with it. Took me a few years to realise they'd asked that because there were constant problems in the role I was in.

'we're not looking to employ people right now' (as they have the hiring listing still up).
This is actually a huge problem. Many job postings are basically fake, and the companies have them up for their own selfish reasons.
They are there incase someone quits last minute and they have CVs they can call. Or checking to see which kind of people apply and how much demand there is for a job so they can change wages when they actually need someone. Or keeping a job up with no intention of hiring but incase some once in a lifetime 'perfect' candidate applies.

Don't be so fucking vulgar, mong.

It's a pretty bad one. They need exposing. Disgusting response that was.

Silly mong probably goes on boomer facebook with the other bootlickers and got this idea from there. Sad! Lot of hate for auditors there.

I never used to be this way. This is what years of loneliness and never being desired does to a man. I have every right to be nasty now.

Fuck off footlad. Post some more fatties.

Can't be doing that when there are 200 hours video games to get through.

based auditors secretly trying to get public photography criminalised by using their legal rights as obnoxiously as possible, thereby turning public opinion against them
<comment>
Look cunt I'd be out and about if I had my chance. Not everyone can be a winner in this world.
<comment>
As if that could ever be enforced. It's here to stay. We will see this shit for decades.

fair enough mate as you were

he's going to be clapping and gurgling and spamming /britfeel/ with auditing videos when he's in his 60s

Going to bed soon. Anyone else? Sleep is all fucking messed up.

a loser is someone who never tries 
so get in there.
<comment>
If SSM wants a new hobby to distract him from gambling, he should get himself a DJI Mini 3 drone to play with. 
He could take aerial shots of Swanage and add them to his drinking videos.
<comment>
and you'll still be here to read all his posts
it great
<comment>
Best case scenario he would get drunk and pilot it into his own head by accident, then sell it at cash convertors. Most likely he would just break it. Good idea honestly.
<comment>
fuck me imagine that foiotage the drone flying into this >>73149575
ffat cunts face up close god I would pay to see that

Right so I'm seriously debating not gojng to this wedding reception, pain in the arse to get to and back. However I have no way to contacting people who I told I was going, what should I do?
<comment>
dont show up, say your car broke down on the way when anyone asks
<comment>
Thread dies last night and Ruthmong is nowhere to be seen. Ruthmong kicks off his routines of ASMR trout's, woe is me posting and auditing. 
Confirmed, Ruthmong is a wagie that works nights. Possibly a security guard.
<comment>
You've already asked lad. No one cares about this low effort make believe.
<comment>
I still think your theory is daft, and he was literally the last post in the thread that died, and he's been here all morning too. Just wasn't getting enough attention at 5am to continue I suppose. He's a neet with a fucked sleep pattern, that's all.
<comment>
I don't know why id make something so mundane, just need advice from the lads
I'll be getting the train(s). I think it would be very rude to just not turn up. Frantically waiting on my colleague to accept my damn Instagram request so I can message him
<comment>

Please don't talk dirty about my Ruth.
<comment>
Ruth belongs to Abood, not you.
<comment>
This is /britfeel/ where the most dullest of dull spastics post, they make up the most mundane situation to be in and then they sit and grin clapping their fat greasy hands as people reply to their drivel.
What a rush, man...

Ruth wouldn't want a muslim bf. She wants a white bf like me. Same with her...she came to this country for a white man.

There are lots of girls who like non-white men though. They have their preferences.
<comment>
Have you not worked it out yet? He is talking to himself.
<comment>
I was posting but I don't bump it out of respect to Americans.
<comment>
Nope. Just a longterm neet who can't figure out the gf puzzle.

He's obsessed with the BMWF pairing

Ruth's 16k subscribers wondering why she doesn't post anymore. Very sad she stopped.

Ruth and LaureI's tuppences
<comment>
If there's one thing I've learned from looking at slags on Reddit is that women are disgustingly messy and take no pride in their houses. Do some decorating and tidy up for fuck sake. If your only job is being an e-slag at least have some pride.

Tuppence arcades
<comment>
That your band name lad?
<comment>
Nope, that's penny slits.
<comment>
He'll never put his willard in a tuppence, so he fantasises about non-existent black men putting their willard in ASMR tuppences.
<comment>
No I wouldn't but I'm just saying she's a very strong, young woman. She may only be 5ft but she will not be walked over by men. You would be embarassed big time by her in a real life situation.
<comment>
Imagine thinking pepper spray will save you when literal unstable men walk the streets with guns in the USA.

Very weird lads. Took a nap and my PC was switched off even though I didn't turn it off and put it in sleep mode. Also when I turned my browser back on I got a 'didn't shut down properly, do you want to restore?'. Wonder if house lost power for a bit while I was sleeping?

My sleep pattern is whenever and you wagies are fucking fuming. There's no point being up at "normal" times as a neet.

<comment>
A UPS in England seems a waste of money desu. I could count on a single hand the amount of times I've lost power in the last 5 years. Also I was asleep, so the UPS would have lost power too before I would have shut down the PC.
<comment>
bored of britfeel now, goodbye
see you tomorrow probably
<comment>
i will sleep 12-15 hours a day and still look like shit. it not right
<comment>
Describe a time you gave someone respect.
<comment>
If it was in sleep, the hard drive would've been spun down, fans off and only memory powered anyway. It's reasonably safe to lose power in this mode and not have hardware damage.

Goodbye, till tomorrow.

It's only worth being respectful to my ASMR girls these days. They're the only ones who understand me.
<comment>
they are literal whores mate, leeching money off simps
<comment>
Stop pretending to be me. Stop disrespecting my asmr baes as me. You don't have to be this way.
<comment>
Lads like that though. There's a older woman who brags that her "foot boys" are paying for her birthdays and shit. She's almost sixty. I actually hate her more than the simps. They don't know any better, She's almost sixty and begs money from losers. Pathetic.
<comment>
She looks good for 60 tbf.
<comment>
That ain't her kek.
She doesn't know her face. Just her feet.

So FUCKING bored rn me

Bolton Castle is very underrated in my opinion. Used to have a lovely cafe there and a maze by the herb garden, always smelled lovely. Didn't see any larper lasses like the one in the picture when I was there though.

Shame, they've been renoivated.
I want a proper castle that hasn't been touched.
<comment>
That looks comfy as hell in that one, I would love to live in one of those ones
<comment>
By the 1600s, people didn't want to live in cold and damp castles anymore. Kings, queens and noble men wanted to show off how important and rich they were so they built palaces and great houses. Many existing castles were replaced with much grander homes.
Imagine if these cunts hadn't ruined everything
BRING BACK CASTLES!!

And try doing fhat 8 hours a day on minimum wage. I don't know how anyone could do it. It's so depressing to think this is all that awaits us neets.
<comment>
Stupid William the cumqueer.
<comment>
why should i work at the goyslop fast food that pays the legal minimum wage? a girl can just get on onlyfans.
<comment>
You need a job first to attract the sloot, then you pimp her out on onlyfans, and profit.
<comment>
I won't slave away. I will not give up my freedom.

DJ exposed. He has a wife and this is just creepy. Not right!
https://youtu.be/vmVY9MCQvXg [Embed]
<comment>
So work in fast food, find some dumb girl, tell her I can get us more money if we whore it up on onlyfans? We may lose our dignity but it will beat slaving 8 hours a day doing mundane tasks.
<comment>
Right. Decided on not gojng to the wedding reception. It's all just fucked on the trains. Messaged my colleague on Instagram but no reply. Oh well
Shame because I look fucking killer in a suit
<comment>
slaving 8 hours a day doing mundane tasks
He spends 16 hours a day doing even more mundane tasks at home, for free!
Also Bamburgh is a lovely one too
<comment>
Some girls work in Mcdonalds too, you know.
No idea why.
I enjoy watching them in their uniforms, they're attractrive and yet they have to wear those stupid hats and pants lol. Dumb bitches.

Loads of girls work in minimum wage. If he left the house he'd know that.

He should leave the house and make fun of them like the rest of us.

Yes, but not we, her. You take the pics, and manage the bank account.

Found an old portrait of my apu's distant relative from the 1800s. Being a maudlin wee thing must run in the family.
<comment>
Mate, leave the house. There are tons of young attractive females who work believe it or not. You'll be amazed.
<comment>
Proper scary that. Imagine going to some company and seeing your personal details plastered on the company's walls. Definitely an intimidating tactic to deter any future auditors. Very sinister. I could feel the DJ's chest stop for a moment there.

A 16th Century Scottish castle bought by its current owner to fulfill a childhood dream is on the market for just 150,000 with hopes of a quick sale.

They work the easier jobs. You'll never see them do back breaking warehouse wagie work. Always stuff like reception or HR. Girls would kill themselves if they had to endure the work men do to keep this country going.
<comment>
You've been unemployed for years and don't leave the house. Why do you keep expecting us to believe you have life exerience? The main point of 90% of your posts is that you're too much of a skilless bumbling manbairn and that it's too late for you to do anything about it.

Simple and clean just as I like it, only use it to post here anyway, and maybe some MS-paint
<comment>
If that's what you like. I managed to get a couple of nice oil paintings of landscapes. Unfortunately 1 night I REEEE'd, and they get damaged. Ebay has some decent things, I'll purchase something when I get the dosser payout next week.
<comment>
He's better than any of us lads. He has a wife.
<comment>
Ebay has some decent things,
ok I shall look on there, I have a lot of paintings and Prints already around my home, those signed ones

Only 13 squid, 6 for delivery. What a bargain. I'd buy it myself if it was dosser payout day, ffs.

Ah, it's a bid auction, not buy outright.

He sounds like a teenager yet looks middle-aged. Odd.

lmao you're a lonely incel who couldn't attract anyone. you have failed as a man.

He sounds like your typical low class scum.

Does anyone have a secret lab chair?
Any good?

goes round filming people in public and posting them on youtube
shocked pikachu face when someone does it to them

Should go lad. Went to my friends wedding and shagged one of the bridesmaids after the reception.

The pig won't shag you if you defend her lad.

Oh so I just rot away then if there's no chance of hope? Thanks a lot.

Most British women beyond the age of 30 look like this I find. It's kinda grim to think about.

In every job I have had not one women worked harder, one girl was doing 50 hours a week and that was her sat on her butt browsing her phone and eating, she would get up and dork hard only if the boss came into work, then it was back to sitting

Shitty attitude. Get out and you'll make some friends.
<comment>
I work, a lot
<comment>
Wonder how long AB has got until someone starts posting his family photos. That's the downside of being a big auditor...you get a lot of creeps and angry wagies wanting to find out more about you.
<comment>
I know how to go out but walking around doesn't really get you friends. Do I just knock on random doors and ask if anyone needs any friends?
<comment>
I wonder if he realises that the auditors he obsesses over would definitely think he was a creep and a nonce because of his behaviour online. People like that don't take kindly to stalkers, e-stalkers, etc.
<comment>
We kind of knew what she was like but she was friends with the bosses daughters, We didn't mind as long as she left us to get on with work but she was very distracting when she was bored
<comment>
Not a stalker. Stop making me out to be something I'm not.
<comment>
His wife posts her photos publicly online
<comment>
You're not ruthmong?
<comment>
You obsessively document the lives of young lasses and post them to 4chan. The auditors wouldn't like that one bit.
<comment>
How do you leave stuff in your will to a child? Set up a trust or something?
<comment>
They work the easy roles. Men have to do most of the heavy work.
<comment>
It's a free country, tyrant bootlicker.
<comment>
Who? i'm the guy posting images of land and castles
<comment>
Nah, 
go pub
have pints
make friends
<comment>
are you one of them auditors?
funny when they respond back and say "what's that?" really winds them up.
<comment>
I'm not a drinker and don't feel like I should have to do that. There must be places to hangout where people value their health.
<comment>
I'm asking though, do you think the auditors that you keep posting would be cool with your hobby of obsessively documenting the lives of young lasses and posting them to 4chan? I didn't say it was illegal.
<comment>
This is not me btw. I only post audits for you lads.
<comment>
auditing Ruths minge tonight
<comment>
I beIieve in god
<comment>
AB wasn't invited to the mass audit
Sad
<comment>
That was some impersonator. I don't know what you mean by asmr. I'm into auditing and watching police brutality vids.
<comment>
COOL, which one?
have you choosen the correct one, if you picked the wrong one you end up with the other gods Wrath at the end
<comment>
I don't know what you mean by asmr
I didn't say owt about ASMR you little lying toad
<comment>
AB likes to do things solo to protect his identity. He moves around in an unpredictable pattern too so it's hard to catch him for camback.
<comment>
COOL, which one?
have you choosen the correct one
<comment>
it was mentioned further up. you must think I post that too.
<comment>
Are you going to tell me which one you follow?
<comment>
I don't know what you mean by asmr
Why are you acting like you are not ruthmong?
<comment>
No you're not. Don't be so fucking horrid.
<comment>
I fancy a curry tonight lads. What should I go for?
<comment>
They're different lads. No way someone could like confrontational men and then start going on about some young asmr bints.
<comment>
Are you going to tell me which one you follow?
yes, god.

big fan of our lad SSM I see she is
<comment>
Having a hand cooked southern fried chicken thighburger aren't I? What an experience. Crispy chicken, mayonnaise, lettuce, red onion, processed cheese, special spices.

<comment>
Ruth loves a thorough probing
<comment>
Great thread everyone! Pints after, yeah?
<comment>
Taco Bell any good?
<comment>
Uber eats and just eat have ruined fast food. McDonald's and KFC are no longer fast. Can't go in without a load of brown drivers taking up half the shop demanding their orders and just generally getting in people's way
<comment>
It's absolutely minging in a good way. I've only been to the one near me once because it is very dark and sinister.
<comment>
My mates gf is really intense. Always asking penetrating questions, and what makes is weird is that he's your typical stoner slacker and she's a few years older and quite the careerist. She always puts him down infront of people and it's really uncomfortable. He's smitten though. Had to dip when I was with them last night because I just couldn't stand it any longer
<comment>
Small portions, but relatively cheap
I found the food kind of bland, but not unpleasant
Restaurant was absolutely filthy though
5/10 wouldn't recommend
<comment>
You've really hit the nail on the head there
<comment>
Me? I like going to McDonalds for breakfast at 6am. I'm usually the only one there. Very comfy
<comment>
Same lad, very comfy
<comment>
Finished work, thats 100 good boy points banked for dossing around. better than shitposting all day I suppose. dont even mind it that much desu. The 5 hours of shitposting and browsing the internet feels more worthwhile than the 16 hour grind for no pay

just want to make a few extra quid to live on

<comment>
you're alright lad, you bring me my burgers at any time of the day.
<comment>
Here's an idea. Get a fucking real job you dosser. No man with self respect should be delivering food.
<comment>
don't want pakis and other assorted browns in my country
<comment>
Pretending you're brown? Weird larp, even for britfeel
<comment>
That's better, but still the whole delivery thing still fucks it up. You used to be able to turn up at peak time and judge how much of a wait you would have by the number of cars at the drive through. Now you can go in and they might be busy drive through but also have a steady stream of delivery orders coming in and they end up too busy they can't cope and it fucks it up for everyone. Also what mong orders delivery McDonald's. Waiting over an hour for cold soggy chips delivered by some ropey bloke on an electric scooter. Nah no thanks
<comment>
He's getting very angry at the obvious joke posts again
<comment>
My local McDonald recently did the same thing. It resulted in less seating for customers though
<comment>
Waiting over an hour
It takes about 15-20 minutes from ordering to arriving usually. Sorry about your bad fast food experience lad but it's genuinely very funny how angry you are about it

I never see people actually inside McDonalds. It's just uber drivers when I'm there

Who the fuck wants to eat at a fast food place other than chavs. Take the food and go. Simple.
<comment>
Not him, but my main gripe is that when they fuck up the order and I'm there in person, they can correct it immediately, but when some brain dead paki arrives in his 25 year old fiesta, it takes ages to sort out
<comment>
this all comes down to one thing. internet. fucking internet has ruined society. generations of people just sitting at home not even bothering to go outside to get food anymore. a nation of slugs.

Only town centre restaurants have chavs. The most comfy ones are roadside ones on A roads

girl I was talking to gave me the silent treatment for an hour after I suggested her taking an overnight bus. She's clearly angling for me to get her a hotel ("oh i don't have a place to stay there or a lot of money teehee"). How do I get the room but not lose face by appearing to be fooled by her games
<comment>
Mmm mmm mmm!
That's scrumptious!

Why are so many of you like this? It's fucking bizarre. As if "smelly bedroom" is such a unique phrase that only one person could possibly use it

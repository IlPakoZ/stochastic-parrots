Is this love?
easy mode
It's love only if she makes love to ebony phallus as you watch
Yes next time ask her out, get her number, never take no for an answer, and be very aggressive if you get declined initially, shes just playing hard to get
Nope, they are just doing their job or are just being friendly.
A woman would have to touch me a lot and almost molest me in order to show me that they actually wanted me.
I would eat everything in that picture.
That's a bit much, but they definitely have to initiate at least three interactions before I think they actually are trying to spend time with me.
8 interactions, I think we are getting married
lol, this
This is why I'd rather wait for physical contact. Though I know that will never happen. Talk is cheap, especially in that line of work. Same with looking/staring. It means nothing without talking and touching. They hate (non-Chad) guys hitting on them anyway. Women are the choosers; and at almost 37 (and a bald manlet who is too aspie to escape NEETdom) I know they won't choose me. I have gotten into some small talk with a couple of bar-maids, as well as a few women at a coffee shop (that recently closed down, shit!). It's nice, but I know it means nothing. I am planning no weddings, lmao.

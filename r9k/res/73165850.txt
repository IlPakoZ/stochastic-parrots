Be me
Rising high school junior
Total loser with no friends or hobbies, decide to join a sport next year
Decide on soccer because I played it as a kid and was familiar
Buy cleats and a new soccer ball eager to get ready for tryouts
Go to the local soccer field every morning to practice and run
Look for extra training camps online
Find one and my mom signs me up, absolutely ecstatic to start
Go to the camp and suddenly start to feel dread
I'm the only person new to the sport there, they all mog me in training
Struggle a lot and I can hear people snickering
Second day of the camp and I feel humiliated, pretend to be sick while they're doing running drills and call my mom to pick me up
Explain everything to my parents and my dad tells them that I'm sick so they get a partial refund
Forget joining sports and stay a loser
This was nearly 6 years ago and I randomly thought of the entire situation in the shower and felt like roping myself

I wish I had friends and/or a girlfriend when I was younger. That way even if I'm alone, I'd still have those memories to look back on.
Now I'm approaching 30 with no memories of happier times. And I'm too depressed now for anything to have the same meaning or be as fun as it would have been to me back then.
I'm the same but surprisingly happy somehow, I don't even have money and I can't even drive, I live with my mom and I'm 31 years old lol, I also have no fear of death.

Girls nowadays all want the tiktok eboy type with ultra soft facial features. It's like the female equivalent of us preferring someone like hailey lujan over angelina jolie
That's what most blackpillers don't understand. A blackpiller would see the guy in the first picture, see girls' rating of him and think "what's the problem? is he not masculine enough?" but the problem is that he's "too masculine". He's attractive in the wrong direction and in a way that simply doesn't appeal to girls anymore

Same with jamjars.

the picture I used there might not be the best example though he straight up looks like a kid
<comment>

this
ask a random girl to choose btwn sean opry and timothee chalomet and 99% will choose timothee without hesitation.
men simply don't understand what women look for in men.

I can tell he is objectively attractive by society standard's but just not my ideal. I don't want a total twink like >>73194347 idk these tiktok e boy types are just too weird but I think someone with a boyish and cute charm is nice. Someone with a very sweet smile and laugh.

I want to go on the dark web for the first time after hearing so much about it over the years. I'm only worried about having my location traced by hackers or having my PC hijacked with elite virus software. How can I keep safe? I'm ready to see the absolute worst of humanity.

I'm too low IQ for the dark web sites. It's so annoying have to search for the sites for different things based on the surface web suggestions
It makes me feel even worse when normie zoomers that are barley tech literate, can stumble on the worst sites BY ACCIDENT and I can't find any of the cool ones by trying

you are retarded and underage, the "spooky dark web" is just drug dealers and honeypots

I'm 25. I'm sure there's more than just those things. I'm curious.

Use Tor. Obviously. Don't download anything dodgy if you're using Windows or something, and honestly don't do anything very illegal at all unless you're using a privacy based OS such as Tails OS, and of course don't use any existing emails and just have common sense about things like that.
It's literally just drugs and CP. The only really traumatizing thing you might come across is hurtcore CP and which is obviously highly incriminating and I'm sure you can use your imagination anyway. Just stick to bestgore, honestly. Even if you're being careful it's not worth even the minute chance of pic related.

There isn't. Your imagination has gotten away from you.
This is literally the truth.

So just simply viewing the illegal content can put me behind bars? Cops will really go to that insane degree and effort? Guess I know what I'm doing if I ever go homeless, lol. 
, and honestly don't do anything very illegal at all unless you're using a privacy based OS such as Tails OS, 
I just plan on viewing things, like gore vids much like you'd see on /gif/ anyways. I can install Tails OS to Windows right? I've seen some people do that.

I'm pretty sure. Even viewing it creates a "copy" of it on your hard drive or whatever, in the form of temp data, thumbnails, cache etc. so if you seek it out on purpose it's still illegal.
I can install Tails OS to Windows right
Tails installs usually onto a usb stick, it's a portable operating system. The idea is any computer you put it into and us it on leaves no trace of it being used.

As other anons have pointed out the majority of the dark web is just bullshit illegal trash that you don't even have to see to guess what it's like.
There may be a few random schizo/government suppressed sites posting about different niche things or info brokers but they also are pretty boring unless you're actually a criminal or want to laugh at how poor fucks have to hide from their government like the retarded guy in >>73151230
Personally I find sites that are still on the clearnet but much more obscure to be more fun anyways like any of the random small other chans out there or decentralized shit like the fediverse. Zeronet is interesting too as part of the dark web but I barely browse on there.

Use TOR with USB live image of Linux. Everything you do or download will be permanently deleted once you reboot your PC because all changes are stored in RAM

getting arrested and ruining your life over pol memes

sad 
You'd think that the dark web is better but it isn't really 
All the other anons in this thread do a good job of explaining 
why not just clearnet websurf?

Dark web is just unindexed sites. Remember that forum you used to be on? Log in and go to your account control panel. Now you are on the dark web. Change your avatar or something. Now you are leet haxor.

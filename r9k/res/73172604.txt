After lurking some online female-dominated communities, I'm becoming a legitimate misogynist.
I swear to God, nothing vindicates the incel thesis that women are cold unfeeling sociopaths more than just reading the shit women post themselves. I'm terrified of them, if I'm completely honest. They strike me as borderline reptilian in their coldness and detachment.

Women make stuff up online just to get a reaction from other women, just remember that women are compulsive liars
<comment>
Maybe. I'm still wary and going to continue avoiding interaction with women to the greatest degree possible. I fear them very much.
<comment>
And women that spend time around male dominated places probably turn into misandrists. Both echo chambers are bad. Be it crystal Cafe, lolcow or one of those incel forums.
<comment>
I feel that male vices are much easier to wrap my head around. They seem to stem from anger and fear.
Women's vices appear to stem from a genuine callousness and profound inability to care about other human beings. Such a mindset is impossible for me to comprehend.

Ah yes "the empathetic gender"
<comment>
There is nothing more blackpilling than femcels imageboards.

I sincerely have no fucking clue where this stereotype comes from. I was reading a thread today where a woman talked about how she was going to dump her "loser" boyfriend because she suddenly realized she doesn't "vibe" with him anymore. Like he, a human being who presumably loves her, is just an accessory she can discard when she gets bored of him.
The worst part is she indicated she was going to stay in the relationship until she found someone better to replace him with, even though she repeatedly called him a loser and showed complete disdain for him. Such callousness is unfathomable to me, I felt like I was reading a spider's thoughts.

If you aren't attractive to women than you are potential rapist to them. Remember the college study where 1/3 guys admitted they would rape someone if they could get away with it?
<comment>
Look at the practice gfs threads in here. Many desirable men do it all the time.

I don't think any of the guys who say they have a practice gf actually do. No one with that little self-awareness is capable of forming a relationship.
<comment>
Come on bruh men do the same. please think of better material you guys always dilute Men's rights with such mild inconviniences
<comment>
Which communities? Most women are not hardcore turbofeminists. In general I suggest getting away from shitholes like 4chan but also reddit and that other imageboard that is like the female equivalent of r9k, lolcow or something, don't remember. Normies can be cringe but they are not totally insane.
<comment>
This is deflection in your part.Those people would ditch their girls all the same if they could.
<comment>
I have never seen a man talk about a woman he was supposed to love in a such a callous and dehumanizing way. Show me a time this happened.
Fuck it, it was a subreddit called r/redscarepod. Not gonna post the thread because I don't want them screenshotting and making fun of me.
<comment>
Get real man.Chads with options do it all the time. Women keep killing themselves over such men. I personally know a guy like that and he wasn't even a Chad.
<comment>
Point is they aren't more empathetic than men, unlike what is commonly believed.
<comment>
Both genders are equally vile. People as a whole simply suck.
<comment>
Maybe, but I feel like men are capable of love to some degree. I don't see that with women. I'm not sure my mom even loves me that much.
<comment>
My mom definitely loved me when I was a child.
I'd agree love between unrelated adults is extremely rare, if it as exists at all.
<comment>
I have never once seen CC or lolcor post the mutilated corpse of a male that someone from their website killed. This happens regularly here
<comment>
You're right but i said on another thread foids are only nice because it's a survival tactic. the same way chads don't give a fuck about you women don't give a fuck about you either. You're a man take action. it sounds like you are heartbroken that your mommy gf that saves you dream was a lie.
<comment>
It's true that women don't really feel love the same way men do. They don't quite make bonds with men the way men do with women, but consider that the human species has only survived as long as it has because women usually love their children if not their partners. I had an extremely abusive mother as well and I've only met a few of thousands upon thousands of women that felt genuine love for their male partners but it is possible, just rare.
<comment>
Thats because men dont have as many options as women so they have to grip tighter to whatever they get.
If men could just get a new gf in minutes if they want they wouldnt be able to "love" either.
<comment>
the amount of dick that women regularly have access to is astounding and depressing
utterly vile group of people
<comment>
Misogyny isn't a real word. It's a made-up word by feminists to describe men that hate women. You see, in certain Western countries and countries that have been influenced by the West, women are allowed to hate men and that's okay but if you hate a woman as a man you're some made up word to describe who you are so that other feminists can shit on you for being a decent human being while they're being fucking whores.
<comment>
Hating women for being whores is inherently misogynistic. The secular liberation even began because male boomers thought they would have lots of sex with a lots of women. Nothing is stopping men from becoming whores except women not fucking them en masse. It's hypocritical.

good
<comment>
100% of men would rape if they could get away with it. 70% of those men were liars.
<comment>
You are being a hypocrite. You put women to standards you and most other men can't adhere to.
<comment>
If you think your hole is worth pinning you down and hearing your banshee screams then you are mistaken.
<comment>
Its amazing to me how racists will justify their hatred for blacks by citing violent crime statistics, but these same Chuds dont understand when women hate men for committing 97% of violent crime.
<comment>
the things i have seen women confidently admit online is absolutely fucking demoralizing in terms of trying to find a girlfriend and how i view most women. I willNEVER be able to see them the same.
<comment>
r/redscarepod
Red Scare is a comedy podcast. Is this a bit?
<comment>
Men and women are different, retard. It is not the chud side that has been preaching for decades how men and women are equals and should be judged equally.
<comment>
The woman who posted the thread was being serious. Very little discussion on that subreddit is actually related to the podcast.
<comment>
Same here. I'm too ugly and autistic to get a girlfriend, but even if I did, I would live in constant fear that she doesn't love me and is just waiting for a better guy to come along to dump me without a shred of regret.
<comment>
Conversely, women who use stats to justify their shitty behavior towards men would shriek how racist you are if you did the same thing to black people. Also, women have some control in the matter. Stop dating bad boys and convicts and your odds of being attacked by a man drop significantly, yet women will ignore violence red flags if a man makes their pussy tingle.
<comment>
Found the thread, she said they barely even kissed. This is retarded.
<comment>
That doesn't even make sense. Stop deflecting. How does men and women not being same play into it? You are asking women to do something you would miserably fail in doing. Look at gay men, they don't have women limiting sex so they fuck a hell lot than straight men. You can say that a Chad is different from a Slut as in he is the master key while the Slut is one of the millions but this isn't change the fact is both are wrong if having a lot of sex is wrong.
<comment>
oh yeah, women that are terminally online represent the whole
<comment>
Are you sure it's the right thread? She said she's in a relationship with him and referred to him as her boyfriend.
<comment>
just waiting for a better guy to come along to dump me without a shred of regret.
thats usually how it goes anon its monkey branching, They always keep men in their orbit even when in a relationship. Its why you see so many many men that come out of long term relationships that started in highschool feel so lost after the relationship and have a hard time getting back into a relationship/dating game, while the woman on the other hand... well you know

<comment>
this fucking hurts to watch. I try not to generalize but i realize more and more that there is a a sound being played in every one of their brains, some just choose to hum it out loud.
<comment>
It's more like if Chuds talked about how black people are all criminals, then exclusively hung around in the roughest hoods Chicago or Detroit have to offer for some reason.
Likewise, women that complain about men being violent still continue exclusively dating abusechads because they're "exciting" and give her the pussy tingles.
<comment>
There's nothing that makes my blood boil more than hearing or reading "my boyfriend..."
<comment>
Whats so surprising? Everyone wants to be of some value to the powerful. These women can only get that by dating thugs and petty criminals. They would definitely monkey branch to some gentleman crime lord or a fancy upper class warlord if they could. They don't want to get their ass beat and abused but want other men they deem low value to feel threatened by their "genetically superior" mate. That's how it has always worked.

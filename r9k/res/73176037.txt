how is one supposed to cope with the fact their brain is mentally ill? 
when i was younger i wanted to be a schizo. i failed. i wanted to be a sociopath. i failed. i wanted to never cry. i succeeded however i can still feel everything and now have one less way to cope. thru all of that my brain ended up.. as a mix of everything and nothing. difficult to describe. it goes out of it's way to make things as difficult as possible sub-consciously hence pic related. is there a way out? how do i go back? where are the refunds?

I don't think you're just mentally ill; I think you're also probably retarded

anon.. did you get lost or something? or is that just your way of coping?

Everyone is "mentally ill" nowadays. The world has lost its all meaning so suck it up buttercup.

why are mean guys so much more attractive than nice boys?

Literally the joke to every sundae kids comic is that the female is cheating

1). There's a difference between being mean and teasing (though, not as much of a difference as people like to think).
2). Meanness can get across a sense of fun better than niceness (at least sometimes). And people kind of like to banter with each other, anyway (which is roughly what the comic is showing).

Thats mischievious not mean

Mischievous = mean, depending on the context and people involved.
But what's depicted in the comic is pretty light, and fun-and-games.

most of the time its just because they happen to be physically more attractive. looks is the most significant stat in dating/sex life.
also a lot of people use being a dick to kind of engage with the girl while also not being a 'simp'.

why are playful people more fun to be around?
oh geez idk

Mean guys can dominate other guys, nice guys can't.

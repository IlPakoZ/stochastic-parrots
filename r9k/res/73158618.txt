i tried hitting on my really gay twink friend and he shot me down really hard

of course because twinks are the women of gayworld. they socially behave like women

Getting with women is easier than getting with men for me.
It's over.....................

it was very awkward and made me sad

nah thats not the issue. he pretty much just told me to not be gay and that was the end of it

The gayest you should go is cute trans women

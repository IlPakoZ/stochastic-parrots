i tried hitting on my really gay twink friend and he shot me down really hard
of course because twinks are the women of gayworld. they socially behave like women
Getting with women is easier than getting with men for me.
It's over.....................
oh my god bro
it was very awkward and made me sad
Maybe you're just ugly? Becoming bisexual doesn't make you more attractive.
nah thats not the issue. he pretty much just told me to not be gay and that was the end of it
explain, in meticulous detail, EXACTLY how the interaction went in the closest approximation to reality your memory can muster
The gayest you should go is cute trans women

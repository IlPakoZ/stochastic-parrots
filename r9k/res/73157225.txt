why do you people not use vrchat if you're so lonely and don't want to leave your house? you get to virtually bang any retard larping as a sexy succubus you want
I'm too much of sperg to even enter a world, let alone interact in one. The fuck is wrong with me?
"Do thing, it will help"
No.
I played VR chat once three years ago and it was fun but wearing a VR headset makes me feel like I'm in a sauna, and I played it in public. Buying a headset and trying to verbally ERP with someone in my parents house sounds like an easy way to kill the last sense of self worth I have.
you can't compare vrchat with real life friends.
take the first step and discover that everyone is neurodivergent too
i thought most people here had given up on having a real life friend

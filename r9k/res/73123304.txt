I mean, I have being wanting to die since I was a kid. I keep having hopes that when I manage to do or get some stuff I will be happy, but when I get them I see that I am still the same depressed piece of shit. 
Thought that i was like that because I had no friends, made them and realized I just hate people, then I thought my life would be better if I had sex for quite some time, did that and nothing changed, bought a house, a nice car a freaking motorcycle, a girlfriend (hated that needy piece of shit), the gym and dieting, hikes, hell, even thought gardening will be my call in life at some point, but after a few attempts I realized that it was pointless. 
Now i am in a period of wanting to find a good girl and start a family, but I know it will be hell, and then I won't be able to go back. Everything will be unfulfilling and I will never be happy anyway, so what is the point in living? I will aways be the same sad introverted robot who just wants to be alone and cry about it anyway. That thing that I want will never help me, there is no way out, so what is the point?

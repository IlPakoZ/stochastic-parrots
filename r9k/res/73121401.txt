I dont think theyve gone far enough. This stuff needs to be normalized and protected by law. Its so American.

Westermarck Effect usually develops from spending so much time in close proximity with the family members that you find them disgusting and completely unattractive. 
Same thing usually happens to couples in longterm relationships. They effectively lose all arousal towards and attraction to one another.

wmaf hapa female
Wmaf hapas are so weird. I knew this one wmaf hapa female in college that would save the used condoms of every guy that she slept with. She was like a walking talking cum receptacle for white men. She would literally store weeks old used condoms of mine.

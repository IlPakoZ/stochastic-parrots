It's kind of surreal reading High Frontiers from 1984 and seeing R U Sirius describe how weird the world seems, how everything is changing fast, how consumer space exploration is soon, and how the taboos around gender, sexuality, and psychedelics are "starting to lift" when it's now 2023 and all of that is still happening and they are still only "starting to lift".
What happened? Or what didn't happen and why didn't it happen? Do you think psychedelics will still be mostly banned in 2062?

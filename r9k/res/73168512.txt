Signed up for some BJJ classes. My evolution is soon at hand.
Brazilian jiu-jitsu? I used to do karate when I was a kid, want to go back to it someday.
Yeah. 
Modern shotokan point karate is pretty shit nowadays because of the Olympics. Full contact karate like Kyokushin is cool as fuck though, but its pretty hard to find dojos.
Do muay Thai at some point. Remember to lift weights, train takedowns and look up kneesovertoesguy if you ever get chronic pain.

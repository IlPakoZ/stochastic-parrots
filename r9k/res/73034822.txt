How do I cope with the fact that I'll never get to be some cute twink who makes thousands of dollars off OnlyFans, and who gets to travel around the world doing collabs with other cute twinks and femboys. I just get to LDAR and realize my youth is behind me while others get to have the time of their life.
Picrel is what broke me. The fact that these two guys were attracted to each other well enough that they decided to rent a room in some cozy English hotel and display their affection for everyone to see is borderline suifuel. I wish I never discovered femboy porn jfc.

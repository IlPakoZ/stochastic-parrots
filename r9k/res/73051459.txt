how well do you get along with other people /r9k/
As well as I decide.
I am loved by all.
I can if I have to, at least when I make the effort and there is some formalized setting.
But I hate every minute of it.
It varies. I'm either disliked by incels because I disagree with them on something or they're giving me sympathy/encouragement when I talk about my life. I get along best with the oldfags of this board the most, we have plenty in common.

Why won't anyone be friends with me? I have lots of acquaintances but no friends. They act like they care about me, but they never invite me anywhere or ask me to hang out with. And when I reach out to them, there's always an excuse.

there's always an excuse.
Either excuse after excuse like they're perpetually busy all year round or I just get ghosted and they never respond again.
I give up.

I don't have communication problems. I have a "nobody cares about me" problem.

Dark Triad Chads are the most succesful people around. Empathy is for losers, kindness is for faggots.

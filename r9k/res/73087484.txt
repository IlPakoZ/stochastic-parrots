Why are feminists obsessed with the "right" to abort their own children?
<comment>
So they can have unprotected sex as much as they want without worrying about the consequences.
<comment>
Unironically this, most of the time there isn't some complex game going on behind the scenes. Most of the time people are just straight up being selfish.

Why are men obsessed with controlling our bodies?
<comment>
For the same reasons men want to "control" serial killers
<comment>
Ah yes, women who get rid of unconscious clump of cells are the same as men who violently rape torture and dismember actual people
<comment>
Murderers often feel the need to describe their victims with dehumanizing rhetoric, feminists call their victims "unconscious clumps of cells", Nazis call their victims "subhuman vermin" and so forth

What the first poster said plus they're demonic whores who love commiting sins

Your moral relativism is retarded and you use it to make you feel better and justified, even in your wrong decisions.
<comment>
Even if you asked pro lifers to choose between throwing a jar of fertilized eggs or 10 living breathing children off a bridge, no one would actually save the fertilized eggs over the kids.
<comment>
Okay, but what does your post have to with abortion?
<comment>
And if you asked a random people to choose who gets to live between ten 80 year olds and 5 toddlers, most would choose the toddlers. That's not a very strong argument to justify killing old people

You should be too unless you like seeing hordes of dysgenic, biological dead-ends waddling around. Too stupid to comprehend the most basic literary themes or perform elementary mathematics beyond adding fractions.
Honestly every youth should be tube tied/vascectomied until they at the very least graduate from high school and save up $50k. Let them fuck, but dear god don't let them procreate.

Would you call an 8 month old fetus an 'unconscious clump of cells'
<comment>
So would it be okay to kill someone if you made him unconscious first ?
<comment>
Starving, working to death and tortured for years living breathing conscious human beings in your opinion are the same level of a victim as an embryo? Jesus men are retarded. Imagine being so fragile that you cant fuck a girl knowing that you are not her first because you deem her a lesser being, but at the same time you will protect an unwanted clump of cells just so it can go through hell of living in a bad environment. You are so quick to disregard actual living females as equal human beings but dont have an issue with saving a fetus just to prove your own point and not to actually save anyone. 
And you dont?
<comment>
In some ways I consider an aborted fetus more of a victim than an adult. A fetus is a lot more helpless.
<comment>
There's no control involved though. Except on doctors. Your bodies just do their thing without our intervention.
<comment>
No one performs abortions in that stage of pregnancy retard
Someone who already gained consciousness and temporarily lost it is not the same as something that never did, stop with word plays 
Then youre a fucking sociopath.

are the same level of a victim as an embryo?
That's not the point of his post, brainlet. His point is that you dehumanize and try to justify killing the victim.
but at the same time you will protect an unwanted clump of cells just so it can go through hell of living in a bad environment
Someone being unwanted and living in a harsh environment still isn't a justification to kill them out of convenience
<comment>
Then youre a fucking sociopath.
lol whatever, at least I don't murder babies in the womb
<comment>
No one performs abortions in that stage of pregnancy retard
Good one, then if you consider an 8 month old fetus to be alive, and a 1 day old zygote to not be alive, when does that bridge get crossed between alive and not?
<comment>
Political control is a thing. And its always the men that vote against abortions because they dont treat us as human beings on the same level as them. Our suffering is not their problem
<comment>
You do realize that 50% of aborted babies are female, right?
<comment>
Proceeds to use argument of holes
Anyone who disagrees with me must can't get laid, hates women, and has something wrong with them personally that's related to being attractive to women or their manhood
Even though none of that has anything to do with what was said or the argument at hand
Because I can't make a logical or reasonable argument so I will instead be emotional and try and use shame and insults to hurt your feelings into compliance
<comment>
There's lots of pro-life women.
because they dont treat us as human beings on the same level as them
That's just your victim mentality speaking nonsense. Pro-lifers do what they do because they think the human life in the womb is more important than the convenience of the mother.
<comment>
stop with word plays
You're the one who started them, using loaded wording to back your selfishness.
And why would past consciousness has more value than future consciousness ? You only make a distinction because one is convenient for you. We could argue in the same words for killing intoxicated bums, they're just unconscious unwanted clump of cells living in a bad environment. The problem is not the play on words, but the weakness of your argument.
I am personally in favor of abortion, but there's no going around the fact that it consists in ending human lives. Unwanted and unconscious, but human lives anyway.
<comment>
Political control is a thing
And what is that thing ? 
The fact remains that forbidding abortion does not involve control over your bodies.
<comment>
Yeah pretty much this, everybody these days wants to do whatever they want without any consequences. Well guess what? Laws of nature say that if you fuck, you might get pregnant. You should be forced to live with that consequence.
<comment>
I don't understand how a woman can kill her own baby growing inside her and not feel intense guilt for the rest of her life. That sort of thing would eat away at my conscience forever.
<comment>
You are a fucking brainlet for using this analogy in the first place, because yes, clumps of cells arent humans on the same level as fucking Jews dying in camps you absolute idiot. I dont dehumanize embryos. I never humanized them in the first place. 
still isn't a justification to kill them out of convenience
Oh so you prefer to bring unnecessary suffering into this world instead, got it
Yeah because you dont ever have to even think about that. You are not a woman
I just stated a fact, retard. 
And? I meant actual women. Learn to read. 
I used the example. Just like the dude who used Jews as an example. 
Men lack empathy and your post is exactly why I will always advocate for the choice. Ruined life is not just inconvenience but you will NEVER as a man understand it. 
But sure stay in your echo chamber. If your daughter ever gets pregnant by rape/as a minor/with a severely disabled child I hope you will be equally as eager to step up as morally superior 
Future consciousness is hypothetical. My argument isnt weak, yours is twisted. You know exactly why drunk homeless people are not same.
If you get sick, you might die. Dont use medicine, its unnatural
You dont have to understand it

r9k men with daddy issues who would probably Abandon their own kids have something to say about abortion.
many such cases.

I feel very sad when i see ugly couples outside. Literal subhumans have decent looking wifes and i'm still a virgin in my late 20s. How do fat ugly basterds get more action then me? Makes no sense

Most couples you see are in mediocre, boring relationships so who gives a fuck?

Because they most likely met over some sort of shared interest and don't divide the world into "uggo/chad/stacey"

About to turn 24, in my room alone living as a NEET. I can't handle this lack of progression and loneliness anymore. I just feel like crying but that won't solve anything. How do other robots cope with this feeling on their birthday
I ran away from home and just figured it out. I was either going to kill myself or risk going outside. NEET from 13-21
Join an online community college and work your ass off my dude. You'll make it
I'm 24 today and about to have my birthday party, I will celebrate doubly hard for you anon.
Happy birthday! I wish i could say it will get better anon.
Happy birthday fren.
I mean just pull up porn and wank until your hand goes numb. Once you are done, open good movie and eat or drink.
Play vidya and just enjoy day.
ok I'm fully bawling now, I just can't believe this is my reality. I wish I could reset everything
try being 30 and NEET, faggit
thank you for giving me hope, I've been meaning to move into a big city near me because I live in a small town and there would be better work opportunities but change is scary and hard I guess
I'll try my hardest
thanks anon, I'll celebrate for you too
thanks!!
happy birthday anon! i hope you have a good one
install a dating app you fucking SUSCEPTIBLE
Do you still live with your parents or are you able to get neetbux? I'd kill to be able to live by myself and not have to work (I'm a full-time wagie but couldn't afford to live anywhere).
Incredibly based, why are you so unhappy? I wish I was alone all the time.
Then do something retard
Almost killed myself when i turned 24 last month only thing holding me back is my mom and dad but they are getting old after that I'm gone

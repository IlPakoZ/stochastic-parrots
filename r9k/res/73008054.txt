i have become a neet. my life is actually depressing and i have no actual social life.
how do you spend your time miss?
i kinda miss being anorexic sometimes but i dont miss being cold all the time and my ass hurting
no actual social life.
is that a bad thing
I've never had a social life and I don't know it's worth having
Gain some weight and ill let you be my house wife, you can live off my success and we can travel and do fun shit. You need to gain weight though because you are way sexier with some thickness. I wanna rub my cock against a thick jiggly butt, not some hard bony ass.
shopping online and watching south park, dressing up and doing makeup to take pictures. 
i wouldnt know im not anorexic and you shouldnt be either its bad for you
i get lonely really easy i need people in my life. loneliness physically hurts
i have become a neet
got me interested
i need people in my life
unviable in a gf, too bad
good luck finding someone anyhow in this one life. i can't gauge your loneliness. maybe slow, with harmful roots puncturing your brain.
p.s. you look nice in that dress.

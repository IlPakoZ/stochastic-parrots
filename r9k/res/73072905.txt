Whos in the right?
Definitely your father. Use better grammar.
your dad is right. Being at home and making art are two irrelevant things.
father is right, being an artist is easy as shit and here you are complaining you cant be bothered
You're both right, you're depressed due to being socially isolated, and depression saps motivation. Your father is also right because you're probably being lazy and half assing addressing your depression (and it's underlying causes like social isolation), as well as not doing as much art as you could be doing, even in a depressive state.

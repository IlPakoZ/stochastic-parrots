be me
Be on car early on the morning, pa, ma and lil bro there too
 Pa and ma dropping me off to work 
Using earbuds, listening to the Payday 2 ost
Mom asks a question
 Can't hear it
Parents get mad and start scolding me about how we have little time to be all together and i should not be using even one earbud
Just Say ok 
They proceed to ask nothing but useless shit about coworkers
Does your coworker arrive early?
Did you talked to this other coworker yesterday?
Is hr and accounting on the new building already?
Why are you in other department's Office?
Why is your new Office not ready yet?
Does this building have a gym?
Answer question>conversation is justo this useless questions and answers
Arrive at work
All guilt for ruining family time evaporates and is replaced by anger of how stupid the conversation was
At work think of how better parents may have handled it
Take notes for future me
I Will do all i can to not fuck up as bad, i think a better way would have been to provide lore for the area wey are in as i always take notes when this is done and they have seen me before doing this
Please tell me how you think this could have been done better
Luv you all Brus, remember to be aware of the stupid shit that pisses you off and take notes on how to improve .

I think the big misstake was not getting an abortion, autists are not people.

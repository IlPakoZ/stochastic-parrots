If a girl wanted you to get really fat for her, would you do it?
nah bro
hell no and it could also be an elaborate prank to ruin my life
I wouldn't do anything a woman asked me to do in the first place.
no. it took me 2 years to lose 100 lbs, and i'm really proud of that. i feel so much better than i used to. no way will i ever let a girl convince me to go back to being a lard ass.

HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE MONOLINGUAL

how does it feel like to be a streetshitter?

I feel superior because I don't have to learn multiple languages.

At least feels better than wiping my ass with tissues

I used to work in a mexican restaurant with a bunch of spanish speaking immigrants. they could talk to me in english mostly, but they only talk to each other in spanish. I'm used to not knowing what they're saying unless they talk to me directly. I thought it might be good for them to have a language serve as a privacy curtain for them, but Spanish is such a common language that it wouldn't be that effective. Since I speak English very well, I would get extra opportunities dealing with difficult customers or helping deal with tech support people working for their business.
I think knowing how to brokenly speak multiple languages is less good ultimately than being very comfortable with the language spoken in the place you live.

Learns Spanish to speak to gf in her native tongue and communicate with ther family
Become fairly conversational
We break up
Occasionally use Spanish to talk to agency staff at work
Feels ok. It's pretty cool to have secret conversations, but that's about it.

no stupid writing system (Arabic, Chinese, etc)
no constant spitting/coughing up phlegm (German, Welsh, Hebrew)
everything gets translated into English
capable of clear, specific instructions and beautiful poetry
English mogs every other language out there. Nothing even compares.

It is at least aesthetic, I'll give it that.

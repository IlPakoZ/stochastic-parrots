I now feel completely broken, lost and going insane. I don't know what to do anons she was the only person who I spent time with and I don't want to go back to being lonely 24/7 again, how on earth am I meant to cope? It's been a month but I can't seem to move on and accept being alone again even though I was completely alone before I met her and comfortable with it

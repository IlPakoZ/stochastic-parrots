19 year old NEET
meet the most loving kind girl online
somehow we get really really close
we get together and spend almost all day and night talking and doing things with one another
I begin working very hard as I want to be a good man for her when we finally get to hold each other in person
is this what love feels like? She literally cured my depression
I am in a very deep love for her
I lose her 4 months later because of her illness she was born with
I lose my only hope and happiness in life and become extremely depressed and bitter
I now feel completely broken, lost and going insane. I don't know what to do anons she was the only person who I spent time with and I don't want to go back to being lonely 24/7 again, how on earth am I meant to cope? It's been a month but I can't seem to move on and accept being alone again even though I was completely alone before I met her and comfortable with it

You're beautiful and you're gonna make it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
Shut up baby, I know it! I'm a 31 year old virgin, just about hitting my prime! Ladies, here I come!
but I'm a bad man and I want to do things with women whether they like it or not
Doubt it.
But i like that gif alot its wholesome.
Thanks I guess, but it's too late, it's over for me.
Aye, my man Bender
It's over for me. 
Autism never gave me a chance
If I make the way so how,
If I make the way so how,
Think again to do so how,
Think believe the way so how,
I know again I'll make it now,
I'll see the way -- the end, so how,
So how we do? How may we do?
How may we do? How may we do?
It's just like this, I'll explain it short.
It's just like this, you go and do.
I will make it but most of you guys won't because you are caught up in shit like racism, sexism, nazism, stupid bullshit like that, and they ain't gonna make it at all
i am way beyond point of any redemption. every day is a bland smear of meaningless existence. i'm only waiting for the final end.

Undeniable truth! A powerful statement!
Chainsaw Man is one of the manga of all time. w
Manga you want to read, whatever each taste to his own
But the anime looks like dogshit
No it really doesn't. Looks fine. You're just retarded. Many such cases.
Oh sorry my bad I mistook you for someone who didn't enjoy eating dogshit
Pic related is you except for graphics in a Chinese cartoon. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is outdated as shit and still considered one of the GOATs.
Sure it is, I'm not disputing that. Legend of the Galactic Heroes can be good, and Chainsaw Man anime can be trash. It is possible for both of those things to be true, and that is the case.

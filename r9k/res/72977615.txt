Suddenly I couldnt find women anymore. Wasnt in school anymore, stopped using social media, lost my social circles.
It's now a minor miracle if I find a woman online and she sticks around.
I got to know a Korean 37yo woman online and I'm not really into her, but that's all I got.
She says she wants to visit me super bad but I need to fly over to Germany because she wants to go there. Just realized that she probably has another guy in Germany and she just wants to conveniently meet all of her "prospects" in one trip.
You sound like an insufferable loser.
Fuck you bot poster.
I bet you're not even a real human just a fightbot who insutls posters
i'm a south korean boy
do not talk to a girl from south korea or japan over age 30
most of them are feminists and live in denial in their fanciful thoughts
they are pathetic ladies who grow old alone at the age of 35, deluded that someday a handsome wealthy man with millions of dollars will take them and treat them like princesses in disney flicks
I'd feel so sorry for her
You dont know me in the slightest yet you imply superiority. Are you jealous of me, or just delusional?
I cant believe you incels are actually jealous, bitter and seething over the fact OP gets to be a cuck for a middle aged woman.

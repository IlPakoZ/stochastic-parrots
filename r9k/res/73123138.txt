I don't really believe in dissociation and such, but there's times when I feel like I can't bear any more social interaction. In those moments, I put on my headphones, choose one of my favorite ambience tracks and just walk. I don't really feel my feet, or anything else, I just let my thoughts get the best of me for a while, and it feels like the best thing ever because I'm allowed to kind of be my true self. I am allowed to speak out loud my thoughts but only to me in my mind. Is this what dissociating feels like?

Nah
Everybody needs to be alone from time to time. I love hiking with God.

I've had issues with dissociating for a long time now, and I've always had trouble explaining it. Few days ago I tried VR, and it feels just like that, albeit not as strong. It feels almost convincing enough but it's just shy of that mark. It feels like an illusion im unable to buy into.

I do too. whenever I have one of these moments, I can't help but feel an immense sadness. I've never burst out into tears, but I just feel deep sorrow.

the fuck does that even mean? you seem low IQ, stop introspecting about anything, stop questioning your thoughts and focus on living and enjoying your life

Its literally hopeless. If you didn't meet your current gf in high school its fucking over.
You have the same chances of winning lottery as you do finding a person to spend your life with. It only gets worse the more you age. Every single day you spend not with your life long gf, is a day the two of you grow apart and in separate directions. You will never form such strong bonds with a girl. 
Nobody, no matter how great the chemistry or how in love they are can truly feel bonded to another human they first met past the age of 20. Imagine knowing someone for only two years and thinking you know everything about them. Throw in the modern work schedule and its so fucked, even if you live with them. All of the shared trauma's, passing thoughts, dreams, experiences, character defining moments, is nothing. All you will see of them is what they have become, not who they truly are or were. How can you have trust, how can you even expect a woman who's only known you for a year to not cheat on you when something better comes along?
Humanity is not meant to live like this. You are meant to be friends with your childhood friends. You're meant to raise families with your childhood crushes. Its all so fucked.

You're a fucking retard if you genuinely think you can't date past aged 20, you don't deserve to make it

So long story short, was friends with someone 2 years ago (we were friends for like a year) and at first she gave me her number because she was into me (for a relationship), but I wasn't attracted to them (she's pretty, but ya) and so it basically just became a friendship.. but we started seeing each other less (that was mostly on me) and eventually that caused a strain when we went months without seeing each other and then she ghosted me so I told her not to talk to me again. 
Would it be weird to try to befriend her again? I burned the bridge and regretted it, but having her as even just a casual friend would make me feel better. Fyi she hasn't had a bf since high school. If she was with someone, I wouldn't even consider it. I'm doubting she'll want to be as close as we were before, but I'm thinking she maybe would be okay with just having a tie with me? Or maybe not since she did ghost me. Idk. Maybe I'm being retarded.

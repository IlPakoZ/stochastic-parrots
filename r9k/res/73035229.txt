i cant believe im a 24yo kv
i should've ended my existence at 16
wahoo i am a HECKIN A KHV INCEL !!!!!!! :33
It's only truly over at 40+ imo. 
R9k gets hung up on teen romance etc. at least in the old days, so they think it's over if you hit 20 or even 25. The truth is there's quite a bit of time to get your shit together if you go for it and think it's worth doing. The issue is most robots convince themselves it's not worth getting their shit togther before they even start. Foir most people having a gf is a symptom of having their shit together, not the root cause.
Not really, everyone that is normal lose it at 16-20

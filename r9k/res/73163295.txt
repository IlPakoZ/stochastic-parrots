Ten years ago was the only time I ever visited this board, browsed the catalog and thought "man if these guys just lowered their standards they wouldnt be alone"
Maybe its true for some of you, but today im 25 khv, never thought O'd emd up this way because I have no standards, im well read, funny, have outdoors hobbies, physically active, a genuine romantic, but I had the nerve to exist as a shy, short, ugly male in 2023, so yeah, I've not even hugged a girl in three years, im so touch starved it's actually kinda funny
I'm sorry for judging you guys, probably gonna kms soon, cause everywhere I go I see couples all around me, I can't take this shit anymore, just thought I'd come here and apologise before I ended it.

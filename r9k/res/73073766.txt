Why must all the yummy foods have seed oils in them?
do you speak of nuggies, tenders, and borger
whats wrong with seed oils
 unoriginal
I have good news OP, there's no strong evidence that seed oils do anything people on leddit and pol say they do.
there's no strong evidence that women practice hypergamy or that working hard to accomplish fitness goals and develop social skills is a futile waste of time either. but look around here
Have you seen how seed oils are made? it's gross idc if it isn't jewish estrogenic magic or some other schizo shit.
nigga who cares?
life is short so enjoy it, sometimes that means getting fit and having fun, other times that means being a fat disgusting miserable slob
do what is right for you
have you seen how tallow and dripping and lard are made. hell have you seen how industrially produced butter is made
This is an epic reason to be against eating seed oils so I almost regret debating lest you change your mind. But expeller pressing isn't gross at all though, what are you on?
ok but are there any GOOD oils?
nothing is GOOD or BAD it's FOOD not an act of goodwill or malice or whatever man. christ. you need it to live. just don't eat too much
They aren't as "yummy" as you think. Stop eating goyslop for 2 months and taste it again
fats are fats, more or less. the trouble is that in industrially processed foods "seed oils" are largely hydrogenated into trans fats which have demonstrated negative effects on cardiac health
Goyslop's comfy though
you have been eating dung your entire life

What the fuck is going on?
you know what's going on... you're groomed, buddy boyo!
Friends and connections anon . Only people who get jobs online are people with top 10% resumes and same goes for online dating . I only got most of my jobs through family and ones I got online tend to be shitty ones that no one wants to work at.
The job I got through my mom is the one I've had for the past 5 years, but it's not working for me because it's part time (they don't want to hire anyone fulltime), only pays $9 an hour, and only pays biweekly. I had a second job for a while, but the pay was the same and hours got cut.

Why do men make up reasons to be afraid of women?
Usually, it's for the incel bullshit you'd see here. But then there's this one guy who goes into a panic when someone suggests dating a girl, all because his last two break-ups were "really bad", and he doesn't want to "go through those again".
Really? You're going into a panic over THAT? Are you 12? And I think the most painful thing here is that he has no problem being friends with women, and acts perfectly fine around them. But the moment somebody suggests he get together with one of them, or interprets their friendships as something more, THAT'S when he starts to panic, and even avoids her for an indefinite period of time. Which is unfairly singling her out, and treating her like she did something wrong.

Women can lie about you and fuck your life up within minutes.

Yeah, god forbid some guy just wanting to be friends, and avoid the toll romances can do to your mental health. The audacity.

It's a psychological reaction. A knife can be used to create delicious food, but someone who has been stabbed by one will be hesitant to use it. Women can provide endless amounts of love, but can also bring a huge moment of grief into their life, so someone who has experienced that is going to be scared it could happen again, even if it's unlikely.

idk dude when I was in 1st or 2nd grade I had a gerbil and I was afraid it would run away if I left the cage open so instead of feeding it the regular food I just gave it these pretzel treats for him since I could slip it through the cage, and he ended up dying in one of the little tunnels maybe bc he was too fat or something idk.
but that shit happens EVERY TIME, whether its a friend, family member, or girl. and that was before i got backstabbed by basically everyone I knew, so i dont like my odds with the next gerbil.
it was my fault the gerbil died and i knew it so when i see a gerbil i want as a pet id rather just ignore it to avoid hurting them and me as a result i didnt even really like my last one that much but i was still really sad

You always think too highly of yourselves and only think about sex and relationships. Sometimes we just want friendship and NO that doesn't mean we think you're ugly, you're just a narcissist. There's a myriad of reasons to want friendship over a relationship, and many don't even directly involve you/the girl in question.

If you wouldn't date an onlyfans model you are a misogynist.
<comment>
labels are meaningless

onlyfans models belong to black men. in fact all women ( espeically white women) belong to black men, simply because they are the superior race.

And? so is anyone who is around women enough, including most women.
That said, if she is pretty enough and a NEETsister, I'd actually talk her into joined pictaking myself, shit sounds fun

Why the long nose, shlom?

Wouldn't bother me, as long as she wasn't fucking other people irl/censored her face. I'd probably join her.

This is some fucking dope art, is it yours?

I would, if we both like each other and want to date each other then I don't see the problem. The only stipulation that I'd have is that she doesn't fuck other dudes while we're dating. If she does just nudes and stuff that's cool otherwise I'd be fine on joining in on the action if she wants to film sextapes.

how can anyone go through life knowing virtually everyone experiences intimate love and sex, and you dont?
what a hollow shell of an existence, honestly
I've never really found it all that important. Just sounds like work, I've had the opportunity and I've realized I'm a lot more comfortable alone without all that responsibility for another person's feelings.
honestly, it sounds to me like you are lying and coping, but okay
just casualyl experience the abyss and emptiness and horrors of life alone without ever knowing love, and pretend like its not a big deal
ok
That sounds like projection. It just never makes me sad idk how do I figure out if it isn't a cope? I figure if I did care I would be as bitter about it as you are now.

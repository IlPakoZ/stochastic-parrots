I dug through his post history and he is suicidal after showing up to a date at a fancy restaurant without telling her his height and she started laughing and walked out. 
what advice would you give him?
to vote against womens rights and NPNW.
he will never be romantically loved by a woman, especially not when it matters (before the age of 25).
play Minecraft with me and I will convert him to Islam and marry him to my little sister.
I'm not good looking, but thank goodness I'm not short anymore. Even with a good looking face I hated that shit.
Height does not determine a person's attractiveness. Attractiveness is subjective and varies from person to person, and physical appearance is just one aspect of it. What is more important is the individual's personality, character, confidence, and other qualities that contribute to their overall appeal. It is important to avoid making assumptions or judgments based on superficial characteristics like height or any other physical trait.
gaslighting normalfag
Kind of silly not to reveal that even though obviously the roastie could have sat through the date and rejected him in a much nicer way. Mostly her fault but he set himself up for a bad time.
Height determines a person's attractiveness. Attractiveness of men to women is objective and is consistent between women and cultures, and physical appearance the only aspect of it. What is least important is the individual's personality, character, confidence, and other qualities that contribute to their overall cold loveless utility. It is important to avoid making assumptions or judgments based on romantically meaningless characteristics like personality or any other non-physical trait.
What do you think would happen if he paid a PUA to teach him seduction
You look cute, would snuggle
retardbro? is your brain okay?
While these techniques may work in some situations, it is important to note that they can be manipulative and disrespectful towards others, especially towards women. Using PUA techniques can also create unhealthy power dynamics and can lead to problems in relationships.
Furthermore, relationships are built on trust, respect, and genuine connections between individuals. PUA techniques focus on short-term, superficial interactions and can undermine the foundation of a healthy relationship. It is important to approach potential partners with honesty, respect, and genuine interest in getting to know them, rather than relying on manipulative techniques.
In summary, while PUA techniques may work in some situations, it is important to approach relationships with honesty, respect, and genuine interest in building a healthy connection with a potential partner.
why would you tell someone your height before a date? would you tell them the length of your fingernails? count the number of nose hairs you have? the width of your eyebrow hair?
shutup retard turdwhore, women don't care how you treat so long as you're tall and handsome.
that pua shit never works
god the worst part about chat gpt is how uncreative it is in how it responds
maybe the guy should just stop trying to date women out of his league. I mean he got a girl to show up and that's not easy.
It is not accurate to say that only attractiveness matters in any aspect of life. Attractiveness can certainly play a role in some situations, such as in the realm of dating or other social interactions, but it is not the only factor that determines success or happiness.
In most aspects of life, such as career success, personal relationships, and overall happiness, a person's character, personality, and other qualities are just as important, if not more important, than their physical appearance. Traits such as kindness, empathy, intelligence, work ethic, and communication skills are highly valued and can contribute significantly to a person's success and happiness.
It is important to avoid reducing individuals to their physical appearance and to recognize and value the full range of qualities and characteristics that make them unique and valuable.

ah, so it is chatgpt.
Women routinely reject or otherwise filter out guys by height so that's why.
If other features mattered like that then it'd be a good idea to disclose them up front too to avoid wasting your time with a roastie who hates guys like you.
Better to let yourself get filtered up front so you can work with the ones who aren't turned off by your body than to hide it and get laughed at on your date like this guy.
Yeah he should just kill himself or just drop out of society. I'm sorry.
Just lean into it, get a gnome hat and grow a white beard
No they don't, incel. Women filter by personality, hygiene, and style. You might have a Napoleon complex/insecurity about height. I see short men with beautiful women every time I go outside by the hundreds.
and professional life. It can damage your relationships with others, create unnecessary conflicts, and make people less likely to want to work or socialize with you.
Treating others with kindness and respect can have the opposite effect. It can improve your relationships with others, increase collaboration, and foster a positive work or social environment. People are more likely to want to help and support those who treat them with kindness and respect.
Additionally, being rude can also have a negative impact on your own well-being. Studies have shown that being kind to others can increase feelings of happiness, satisfaction, and overall well-being.
In summary, being rude can have negative consequences for yourself and others, while treating others with kindness and respect can have positive effects on your personal and professional life.
Women are psychosexually identical. If you're unattractive to one woman, you are unattractive to all of them. This is biological fact.
There is no such thing as "the ones who aren't turned off by your body", all you're filtering for if you do that is cunning women who are looking to check off some goals coldly and lovelessly in "relationships" who can never love you. Simple fact. If women aren't eager for you in general, you're not attractive to WOMEN.
this, I know a balding indian janitor who is 5'1 and regularly pulls supermodels
what is a turdwhore and why do you keep saying it, underage-kun?
he deserved someone better than that anyway. he should keep trying and not give up after one bad date, there are way better ppl out there for him to meet and get with.
All individuals, regardless of their gender, are unique and different from one another. It is not accurate or fair to generalize an entire group of people based on their gender or any other characteristic.
Assuming that all women are the same is a form of gender stereotype, which can lead to harmful biases and discrimination. Gender stereotypes are often based on outdated and inaccurate beliefs about gender roles and can create unfair expectations and limitations on individuals based on their gender.

I don't. Occasionally I'll see a short older man with his wife but I never see young short guys with gfs
I'm not an incel and I'm 5'10. Women obviously filter by height or it wouldn't be listed as part of most dating app profile setups.
Just because short guys can get laid doesn't mean women don't filter by height or reject because of height.
i see literal thousands i think you're just looking for reasons to be insecure and an angry bitter little man. real short man energy.
Height does not determine attractiveness. Attractiveness is a complex and subjective concept that is influenced by various factors, such as personality, confidence, sense of humor, communication skills, and physical appearance, among others.
While some people may prefer partners who are taller or shorter, it is important to recognize that everyone has different preferences and there is no objective standard for attractiveness. It is also important to avoid making assumptions or judgments based solely on someone's height or any other physical characteristic.
this has literally never happened. women swipe left on short guys because they are insecure and have complexes, not because of their height. its a personality problem, short guys have bad personalities.
shut the fuck up chat gpt jessus
omfggg i agreed with the message but youre totally right
Lol I'm 6'1. I'm just not delusional like you. You're probably lumping guys that are average height in with men that are short. What height would a man have to be for you to say he's short?
Holy shit you're completely insane.
The OP is literally an example of a guy getting laughed at and rejected because he's short.
Just because random ugly short guy X has a girlfriend doesn't mean girls have never filtered or rejected by height.
There are literal findings you can look up from dating sites of how much women use the height filter option and which heights they choose to filter on.
an average guy is 6'-6'2", short is under average, tall is above it.
regardless of your supposed height, you are giving off MAJOR short guy and small dick energy by being insecure. Nobody judges short guys for being short, they do it because they have bad personalities.
unironically this anon just answered the question 100% right
durr thoughever
women can magically sense personality from a single picture. Women are unironically demi gods.
Oh, you're baiting. I'm retarded lol
yeah, mhm, im starting to see why you're alone. gee i wonder why
It is important to remember that physical attributes, such as height, are just one factor that may or may not influence a person's romantic attraction to someone else. Attraction is a complex and subjective concept that can be influenced by many different factors, such as personality, communication skills, shared interests, and mutual values, among others.
While some people may find taller individuals more attractive, it is not a guarantee that all women will love you simply because you are tall. It is important to focus on developing strong and healthy relationships based on mutual respect, trust, and genuine interest in one another. Instead of relying on your height to attract women, try to focus on building your confidence, communication skills, and other qualities that can make you an attractive partner.
In summary, while being tall may be one factor that some people find attractive, it is not a guarantee of romantic success. It is important to focus on developing your personal qualities and building healthy relationships based on mutual respect and genuine connection.
I've known peopl ehis height that didnt have a problem dating. An old school buddy of mine is 5'3 and skinny built and he's got more pussy than the women's locker room. He made up for the fact that he was short with being charismatic as hell, very social, and the "friends with everyone" guy. Being short doesn't automatically disqualify you, you just have to pick a different strat. Also, I've talked to some short girls who said they want to have someone roughly their height instead of someone that's like a foot taller than them, so there is girls out there that genuinely prefer short kings.
this is the little man energy that gives women the ick.
5'9 in the us actually
I'm not an incel and I'm at a good height (5'10).
What's bothering me is how incredibly insistent you are about denying the reality that women filter on height.
I never said short guys can't get a girlfriend. Just that it helps to disclose your height up front to avoid situations like in the OP.
yeeesss free yourself by never talking to women and never dating women!! those activities are for bitch simp cucks only so just stay online and depressed and throw away your vote towards some nazi!! you are free from your shackles now :D
messed up women exist. that doesn't mean all women are messed up. that's the point.
this, i know a guy who is only 4' 2" and he is of a South Asian racial background and works janitorial services but he slays more mad pussy than the women's changing rooms. He made up for it by being super confident and charismatic, a social butterfly, the guy who can be friends with anyone. Being short doesn't automatically disqualify, you just have to have game bro. Short girls totally don't lie about their preferences to seem less shallow, ignore all the factual evidence and pretend to accept my worldview where women aren't obsessive height queen turdwhore retards.
They can even sense energy? Can someone whos is good at physics explain this to me? How do women do it? I want to worship those creatures; they are so pure and powefrull; angelic like.
nope, those are old stats that include 80 and 90 year olds, 5'9" is like 1% of guys. 
your obsession with being a "good height" is why women reject you. your personality gives off major short guy vibes.
How is it a personality thing if the filtering is done before even looking at them? See:
I think it just feels better to blame these short guys for having a hard time instead of acknowleding they have some extra hurdles other guys don't.
this and unironically. NPNW. Don't be slave to turdwhores who wouldn't spit on you to put you out if you caught on fire.
they DO look at them, they know that short guys have bad personalities so they reject them on that. not their height. stop trying to make women out to be evil. they're avoiding bad people and theres nothing wrong with that.
if short guys worked on their personalities women would start swiping right on them
I only even mentioned my height at all because you're repeatedly trying to dodge the point and blame it on me being a short incel when I'm not short and not an incel.
And 5'10 is 1 inch above male average where I live.
Pretty sure you know all this and are pretending to be retarded for bait.
he's probably american you retarded nord
idk what any of that means, but you type like a blindly seething teenager. chill out, bro
cope seethe mald dilate sour grapes and touch grass. simple as.
ick come through phone screen and enter girls head; then they feel the ick and conclude that the guy on the photo has 'short guy energy' and 'bad personality'.
I thnik it has something to do with quantum field.
I'm not saying women are evil.
I'm saying it's dumb not to disclose height up front since at least a large number of women do filter by height and leavinf that information out results in situations like in the OP where instead of getting to focus on the girls who would date you and like you you're getting laughed off by a girl who didn't realize how short you'd be.
you forgot to say "turdwhore" again, little dude
women filter by personality and confidence, it coincidentally corresponds to height. she laughed at him because he was giving off major short guy energy, not because he was short.
sneed seethe mald dilate sour grapes touch grass.
I don't see how this nonsense distinction matters when it functionally results in this (filtering up front by height i.e. exactly what's being claimed here):
Whether you call it height filtering (because short height correlates to bad personality) or just height filtering in itself, the result is the same.
what age are you and exact city or suburb you live in? genuinely curious if it aligns or opposes my biases.
go piss yourself in ohio you stupid rat stupid rat bastard.
it matters because they wouldn't be rejected if they had good personalities. women dont care at all about height, just the ick they get from seeing how short of a personality he has.
lmao shaking hands seethe cope sneed dilate sour grapes mald. touch grass.
hey, that's extremely rude, my guy.
but how would women then know which short guys do in fact have a good personality (if such even exist) if they won't even givem them a chance (e.g. they swipe left)?
Aren't the women and white knights first to sceam how you shouldn't generalize - maybe there are some short guys with good personalities.
They are, in many cases, factually rejected before personality can even be considered, which was proven here:
by the energy/vibe they give off (short guy, little man energy). If they had good personalities, they would be tall.
lol ok you got me. decent bait.
The simple reality is that while some women do prefer taller men, not all are going to care about that and some short women would like someone around heir height. Just because some women filter by height doesn't mean they all do. More often than not in my experience, your personality can do a lot of heavy lifting to make up for any "short" comings in the looks department. This is especially true if you are seeking a relationship with someone where they are going to judge your personality just as much as your looks. Despite what I've seen a lot of sad people on here say women really do care about a guys attitude and personality. Even if you are a total chad, no one is going to want to be around you if you're a dick and at best you'll get random hookups but not a relationship.

drink a fat goat up your head off a cliff go die in hell and eat roach piss for a living you fack fuck
this sounds realistic but you have to be honest. the reason short guys are bitter is because they got shitty treatment their whole life.
Its so easy to say

hmm
how bad is my balding?
you look good retard. wtf are u even talking about
I don't know If I should take that as a compliment or an insult. Not really sure how I sound like ChatGPT other than how I try to write out my thoughts clearly? 
Pic unrelated but she's hot as shit
disgusting roast beef flaps
I understand what mean by saying that your experiences as a person are going to shape your attitude and how you perceive things. I used to get bullied a lot in school, and consequently even as a young adult I was a pretty insecure person. I wasn't bullied for being short, but I know how one can become bitter after being mistreated for years based on something that they can't control. That being said, at the end of the day (you) are responsible for your own emotions. After a certain point you have to stop caring what some people say about you. the only way to get real confidence as a person is to learn to manage your insecurities and be at least okay with yourself. There's always going to be people out there that will shit on you for anything because they are miserable and probably hate themselves too so they are trying to fill the void in their heart by making someone else as miserable as they are. Regardless, not everyone is like that. Getting back to the point, not everyone is going to have the same thoughts/feelings/preferences. People are pretty diverse and you cant just put half o the population in a little box and say they all act a certain way when it's just not true. As I said before sure, some women prefer taller men, but that's not always the case and not everyone is going to put a guy down for being short ether.
Speak for yourself, but I love that roast beef. I'd eat that shit for hours. I'll always prefer an outie over an innie on a woman.
Stop looking for girls online. Stop and think what kind of girls would be fine with/like reducing a man down to a job application? Start understanding the girls that are not as picky about things like height rarely or outright don't use dating apps.
chatgpt doesn't write clearly. it is notorious for logical errors and inability to incorporate new/factual information, because its goal isn't truth its simulating real ordinary average people, who are usually quite slow and very wrong about life.
Which is why you have to stop using dating apps and online hook up culture. Those bitches don't give a shit about your personality because they have this wonderful app that tells them 6'2 rich men are everywhere and if they can get over you not being that kind of guy they never use the app in the first place.
literally all women do this, whether explicitly or in their head. 
height is objectively the #1 criteria women use for picking a partner, non-height criteria all combined is less than 10% of attractiveness.
virtually all women use dating apps, they just filter on and off very quickly so only a small portion are on at any given time, because chad snatches them up to be on his casual sex rotation. 
simple as. straight facts.
I'm not so sure. I'm not attractive but when I'm feeling happier and calmer women have seemed to like me more. I know that's not personality exactly but it is something deeper than looks.
So you don't get rejected, feel suicidal and post your face on reddit.
height is objectively the #1 criteria women use for picking a partner, non-height criteria all combined is less than 10% of attractiveness.
Source on this? Most data seems to note it's the jaw line as #1 with shoulders as #2, height is up three but women find any man 4inchs or taller than them attractive so unless the guy is under the average height of women in his area by a good degree, he's got a great shot.
25% of the prime age do, and how many of those are just dudes trying to do some phising?
Most women don't use online dating until they start hitting the wall and why the fuck do you want them then? 
You could get the girl you want but you got to get out in the wild irl world and find her. Online you are just going to get mocked
True. Dating apps don't do anything good for you unless you can stand out and just want causal sex. 
I mean yeah some woman might only care about height, but that's not always true at all. Especially so if the woman isn't looking for casual hookups and is actually looking for a partner. Not all women use dating apps ether. I've known plenty who has never used them.
god damn that is a lot of old people using dating sites but I guess that makes sense considering where the fuck would a 40yo person go to hook up?
Seeing retards like this post their insecurities about nothing really makes me realise how hard my genetics fucked me.
These retards would not last a week with my norwood 6/7 hairline and naturally fucked up skin.
How much you want to bet most of those guys in the 52% are on the highly agreeable end? Like, they fall apart trying to ask a girl out in real life so they are hoping online dating is enough of a safe space to get them pussy? Also your chart misses the biggest joke about all this which is dating apps only have about 1/3rd or less active female profiles meaning that even if you paired up every single guy profile with a girl profile, you still have at least 66% of guys without a date.
Yeah, that's my problem so nothing can save me
Most young men are single now
Well of course they are when they are being chicken shits using dating apps
It wasn't active it was over all. Meaning a lot of dead or inactive profiles are used to get that 1/3rd number.
remember anon, height is a choice.
Nonsense, my brain is broken. I fail at basic social interaction.
What else you can do?
broski im autistic and i used to work jobs. i worked various jobs like william ashley stocker and physical labour jobs while literally homeless living in homeless shelters as a teenager
autism is for life, and experience does nothing for you
you cant relate or understand our pain. this shit is legit a death sentence. i hate normies like you with a passion. and i hate god even more for cursing me with this life. what a cruel cunt of a god
what kind of nonsense is this?
Autism is a brain disorder its as curable as low IQ you normie scum
Good question considering most social institutions have been destroyed one way or another, however looking at the data it looks like answer is date young and go to social events while young, that was easier two decades ago than now however. If you are not young I have no fucking clue and I will never understand why most parents filtered disaster with their kids and feed them the lie they could date or find a partner late in life as anyone worth having gets snatched up young.
no. its genetic and environmental
basically god just decided to make you suffer your while life, while he smugly smiles
this is the worst cope ever. 
you're terminally online. most short normalfags aren't insecure at all, they'll obviously be a bit self conscious, but it's not like on reddit or here where they're suicidal, they just get an extra hobby or two to compensate. also, i heard some stupid bitch say the same thing for bodycount, saying that a high bodycount displays bad character and that the bodycount in of itself shouldn't be an issue. i could go on forever on why that's RETARDED, but it's also ignoring what men (that care about bodycount) think. i don't care about bodycount because it displays bad characteristics, i care about it because, regardless of their character, i don't want other men's dicks in them. women are the same, they want a tall guy because height is attractive to women, you retarded nigger
I am nearly 30. Only male friends, only male coworkers. Zero experience with approaching, flirting, sex etc. I knew it was over at 15. But sometimes I feel sad.
Can't find him post a link faggot
The funny thing is women still prefer guys at 6'0, despite what this chart says. They have it set to 6'6 because that's what the 6'0 guys have their height listed as, while the 5'9 guys have theirs at 6'0.

Also bro being short and mid is better than tall and hot. 
When you find someone youll know they like you for you, and that you aren't gonna be some dumb himbo trophy husband. 
We all gmi bro
height is the only thing that matters to women
if you are tall but fail to get pussy then kill yourself
if you are short then you naturally failed so you are already dead
Especially so if the woman isn't looking for casual hookups and is actually looking for a partner. 
This is just saying "Especially if the woman isn't looking for men she's physically attracted to (and thus can genuinely romantically love) and is looking for a cold passionless partner to exploit."
Unless she has never had casual sex before in her life, willingness to have casual sex with a man is her marker of genuine attraction/passion. There is no getting around this. 
Men need to be very careful not to become the chump she traps in a passionless setup like this. If she's put out before, she'll put out for you if she finds you genuinely physically attractive (and thus can ever genuinely romantically love you). If she makes you wait, there's no passion there, only cold interest. 
not all women use dating apps
99% DO.
No, you don't. Unless you observe them 24/7 with monitoring cameras. Women are notoriously dishonest about their sociosexual behavior and motivations.
nope, i can get you laid by 1000 women who are height queens within 1 hour. give me your personal info.
women dont care about behavior/psychology/personality. they care about tall height and handsome face. pedochadfishing has 100% undeniably confirmed this for all time.
no retard, women are identical sociosexually. if you find a women "interested" in you, she's given up on finding men she can genuinely love and is just tired of being alone. ugly doesn't magically become hot. ugly is always ugly. hot is always hot. and hot for a man is being tall.

Clearly he has a bad personality and isn't being himself. Women instinctively can tell and stay away from him. Maybe if he just smiled more women would respond positively to him. I mean, it's so easy to get a gf now, there really is no excuse. If he stopped being an incel misogynist that thinks he's entitled to a female companion, maybe he'd get one.
maybe the guy should just stop trying to date women out of his league. 
all women are out of his league
it's easy as fuck if you just lie about yourself and only use flattering angles/filters.
which is arguably what he was doing by not disclosing his height
this is just a way for midwits and autists to boil down attraction to one or two variables so they can obsess over it neurotically.

I canNOT imagine just how hellish my life would be at 5'2". Holy SHIT, that's fucked. I'm personally aiming for limb lengthening surgeries to become 5'10". You do you, but that's my solution. Probably going to either get them in Florida or Beverly hills depending on what's cheaper. I don't trust other countries with this.

I dunno anon, I went to classes but I also joined a few student clubs (dragonboat, CS/math, philosophy, volunteering as a tutor). I wasn't a complete shut-in although I'm not an extroverted normie either. 
If it was just a matter of being outside according to your theory, a girl would have shown interest at some point. 
I did manage to find one relationship through a dating app but it took 6 months or so, a lot of ghosting, only a few matches. Anyways I'm almost an oldfag now. I just wish I didn't have to spend the first 25 years of my life living like a monkcel.
thank you. They speak okay english?
The country should be separated by height, people of different height can live in the same place but they get a separate but equal designated region they can always go back to and live peacefully.
You can tell ChatGPT to answer in different styles: 
"OMG, like, I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not! I mean, on one hand, maybe he could learn some helpful tips and tricks to boost his confidence and meet more girls. But on the other hand, if he's really, like, not conventionally attractive, like this particular guy, you know, it might not matter how smooth he tries to be - some girls might still not be interested.
Plus, I've heard that some PUAs can be kinda creepy and manipulative (boooo!), and I wouldn't want my friend to turn into some sketchy guy who's always trying to use these tactics to trick girls into sleeping with him.
Honestly, I think it's important for my friend to work on his confidence and social skills, but maybe there are other ways he can do that without resorting to paying someone to teach him how to seduce women. Like, he could join clubs or groups where he can meet people who share his interests, or he could try online dating to meet people who might be more compatible with him.
At the end of the day, I just want my friend to be happy and feel good about himself, but I don't want him to feel like he has to resort to desperate measures just to find love."
get rekt incels, ai stacey has spoken
anon I was waiting for some normie advice, why did you delete your post?

Incel mentality. 
There's more to life than just dating and sex, child.
Bumping because its over
question for you guys... why dont you try to go to the older taller women? maybe babymaxx you know?
I can't believe people are seriously falling for this bait. Holy fuck you guys are autistic
The idea of height having any significance to attractiveness is brand new TikTok brainrot bullshit. Short boomers had no problems breeding.
Women don't date short people because they're told not to despite being short themselves. Just like how they cover up their ugly genetics with 5 pounds of make-up. Women are literally the cause of short ugly men and because they will not date their looksmatch, the next generation can only average down.
foid here, this image makes me want to cry. i would date him, im 5'1 and i dont care about height.
im 6'4 and have not held hands with a female in over a decade. height is a meme
You're actively trying to fuck yourself over. Plenty of girls who get involuntarily aroused from a tall guy in front of them. Their bodies just go haywire. Girls also adore having their small girly hand swallowed up inside the closed big hand of a tall guy.
why are you single anon? you claim to be sweet and petite
Yeah, but there's no other way to meet women. I'm 32, where the fuck am I gonna meet women other than OLD?
Because there isn't a way to find them.

I'm almost 32 years old.
I'm a khv who have never seen a vagina in real life or been on a date, or had a friend who was female after I turned 13 when it mattered.
I've never asked anyone out and I have rejected 9 advances from girls through my school year. Not consciously rejected, just too socially incompetent to know what was going on.

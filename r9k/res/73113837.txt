Isn't the fact that you never see people with chad good looks working dead end jobs well into their 30s, 40s and beyond a simple way to prove the blackpill?
Sure, they might do it for a bit when they're young but soon enough doors will simply open for them with no effort and they move on to the next step of their life as easily as water flows down a stream, no effort required.

Black pill isnt real women really care mostly about personality good looks will get you a few hook ups sure but they wont stay with you just because you have a chad jaw or abs they will fuck you and leave you because they got bored.

Blackpill is about more than just how much women like you, thinking that's all it's about is a common mistake many people make.
You will be more successful in life with rugged chad good looks, people will naturally trust you and give you opportunities because attractive = trustworthy and good in our monkey brains.

The picture is so retarded. Of course people mean attractive people when describing their types. The dude who likes goth egirls and the dude who likes tradwife dress church girls are both envisioning the same girl in different clothes. The guy who likes flat chests and thin women and the guy who likes thick large chested women both envision attractive faces and feminine fat distributions.
How can anyone be so retarded as to hear "I like nerdy guys/girls" and actually think that means "I am attracted to unattractive people"? Why did you ever think that? If women hear "I like goth/nerd/etc girls" you don't see them retardedly assuming that means an otherwise hideous woman automatically becomes attractive. They know what it means.

Retard. Men are attracted to average women

It's more that you'll see men that'll flat-out specifically fetishize negative traits, but never see women do the same. In the sense that if you gave them the choice between two potential partners, and everything was identical except that one trait, they'd choose the person with the "unattractive" trait over the "attractive" one.
If you offered men the choice between a tall woman and a short woman who were otherwise identical, both options would get quite a lot of men who'd pick either. But if you gave women the choice between a tall man and a short man who were otherwise identical, practically every single woman would pick the tall man.

This is so funny its so true. was waiting for this

IDC about OP's retarded opinion but this picture is actually dumb as fuck. Are you actually mad that women fantasize about attractive men and not unattractive ones?
<comment>
women cant differentiate between looks vs personality in attraction. they would put up with most the shittiest behaviors of someone attractive than to ever feel loved by a below than average man
<comment>
this just means men care about different physical traits than women do. if you offered men the choice between identical women but one had alopecia and one didn't, every man would pick the woman without alopecia. not to mention, it's just straight up wrong, there are a ton of women who like short men

physiognomy is real in the sense that your environment and behaviors can shape your appearance. there have been many Chads which found themselves stuck in dead end jobs. over time, their skin complexion worsened from a lack of care, their physique and hair degraded from poor nutrition, and the depressing reality of their situation caused them to develop poor habits such as alcoholism or insomnia.

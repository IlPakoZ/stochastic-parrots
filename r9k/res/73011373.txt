girls would rather share a successful chad than have you all to themselves
while you're trying to catch up and succeed in later in life, chads and normies stay winning from their teenage years with prime girls. lol
why are they all looking 30+
while you're trying to catch up
In what way?
Thats a chad now?
Is any guy who has sex a chad even if hes like a 4/10?
I thought chads were 8/10+ men
4/10
He definitely mogs you, virgin.
Suicidefuel, I remember having a moment like this in college. It was during Covid so there were strict lockdown requirements and no one was on campus. 
I was a senior so I was living off campus. I was super isolated and lonely. One day I was walking home from the supermarket and I saw a Chad in one of my Zoom classes sitting in a nice car with three girls from our college. That was the moment I felt the 80/20 the most. It was right in front of my eyes and I could no longer deny it or pretend like it only existed abstractly.
Shut up incel there is no 80/20 you just need to go shower and get a haircut and be CONFIDENT
god commented on that to me one time when i was surprised about how chad was living. he said sarcastically "i know what goes on out here". does that make sense to you?
yes, women have very low standards for white men.
jfl its over
jbw
god could probably suck our dicks too but he doesn't WTF
Kek 
It was easy to deny or forget about in hs, but in college Chad's lifestyle is constantly shoved in your face, and it becomes undeniable that your looksmatch isn't as lonely as you are, that your life experiences are not remotely the same, she's simply another body on Chad's list while you rot alone.

I think tranny-kun was banned
<comment>
Yes mods are very wishy-washy when it comes to banning for avatarfagging lol.
<comment>
My bf is a freedom fighter! One by one, he methodically demolishes the fauxbots. They can't handle the heat, especially when their favorite e-girl gets pummeled by my bf's superb intellect. They play dirty and silence him, because he speaks the uncomfortable truth to their lying fauxbot faces.
<comment>
Huh tranny-kun? Is that you?
Was he banned or not?
<comment>
I am a friend of tranny-kun's and I will be posting for him until he gets unbanned. I'm his representative, if you will.
<comment>
truly pathetic. you guys are no funny, interesting, intelligent or anything. just plain annoying.
<comment>
Mad because you have no argument, are you? Are you butthurt because my bf demolished you in an argument? Well guess what, fauxbot. Real life isn't like a movie. There is no underdog story where my bf beats you down, you rise up from your pathetic position, and defeat him. There will be nothing but pure, humiliating losses. 
TOTAL FAUXBOT DEATH.

TOTAL FAUXBOT DEATH
I still dont't understand if you guys hate or like fauxbots since you also want to inspire them
<comment>
Fauxbots will be inspired by our wholesome love to find their own wholesome love. At the same time my arguments will convince them they're not robots and they have hope to find a gf. These powers combined will lead them to find a wholesome gf and collectively we save the board.

i dont even know what the fuck she's talking about kek. do you know when at christmas you interact with your 5 yo cousins and they vocalize all these retarded nonsense narratives and they take it seriously too? that's what retard san and tanny kun are to me in this board KEK.
<comment>
Wtf I thought you were banned Traner-kun
Also, hi how are you
Do you recognize me? Take a guess!
<comment>
Oh wait I misread >>73183344
Whoops
<comment>
I'm just his friend. Trannykun would never ban evade. He's doing well, though. He had 6 liters of diet soda and can recognize you're the mio boy.
<comment>
encouraging and normalizing even more normalfags on here will save the board
Yeah idk about that one bro
Nice metaphor kek
<comment>
You are a fauxbot lol. You literally claimed to be robots despite being normalfags and finding a bf within like one week of looking. hahaha.
<comment>
You are retarded. You may as well avatarfag if you are going to announce who you are everytime you post just for more attention.
<comment>
It keeps talking about this demolishing the bf did that never fucking hapoens or happened
<comment>
they confuse confidence in ones beliefs for the correctness of the beliefs, like a child.
<comment>
Normalfags are already normalized here. It involves helping them realize their pity party is undeserved and is stealing the lime light from incels.
Name 1 time he was wrong, dough.
<comment>
they confuse confidence in ones beliefs for the correctness of the beliefs
Yep. This is, coincidentally, very NPD.
<comment>
why is he talking about stealing the lime light from incels when he crashes threads with real incels in them constantly trying to make everything about him? Has anyone here seen him not try to make himself the center of attention in a thread?
<comment>
No, and that's why Retard-san loves him. Bitches love Dark Triad guys.
<comment>
If I darktriadmaxx will mtfs not find me repulsive? But in their threads they say I am an asshole and that is why no one will interact with me.
<comment>
https://strawpoll.com/polls/05ZdWv4Lmg6 i think it's time to settle this
<comment>
Hopefully the ban their respiratory ability as well when they inevitably an hero
<comment>

Give us a third option to select neither
<comment>
this but make the third option mr frogman
<comment>
He is trying to call out the fakecel normalfags who steal the limelight from actual incels.
They ban my ability to breathe when he kills himself? Lole.
<comment>
I am going to narcissismmaxx to get mtfs to top me. It is decided. wish me luck.
<comment>
Retard-san by default. She adds nothing to threads and has no real redeeming qualities, but she doesn't single-handedly destroy threads like Tranny-kun does.
<comment>
Queen Iris imposes a (You) embargo on Tranny kun
he gets banned within hours
kek irisbros
just
keep
winning
<comment>
Damn, I really hope chuds don't take this as encouragement to just start mass reporting retard san and tranny kun for avatarfagging every time they appear in a thread. That would be so mean.
<comment>
i dont know who this tranny coon is, but I support exiling them
<comment>
lets do this. i dont think they have many friends to use as messengers anyway

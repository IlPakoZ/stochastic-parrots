autism mode activates
take a puff of my inhaler
clenches fist at this thot
start screaming like a great ape
my epic nyan cat dubstep remix ringtone goes off very loudly
autism mode deactivates
lay down on floor, letting the ringtone keep playing
it calms me. i've found peace.

People don't realize this was really what it was like in 2013
how much epic bacon did you eat
Well shit, it's been 10 years already. Time flies.

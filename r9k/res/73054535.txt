Every normie keeps calling Agatha (threemilk) ugly when I show pics of her, am I really blind that I don't see her as ugly? Help me out, bros, what am I missing here?

Not everyone can have good taste like us, Anon, especially normies.

Is literally everyone around me an NPC then? I don't think that she looks like a model, but she has a unique look and amazing skin, definitely not ugly, why does everyone around me flame her?

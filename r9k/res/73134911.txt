be me at 2am
hungry af, only had lunch 14 hours before
decide to stealthily order pizza
do my order online, state for the delivery guy to not honk to not annoy neighbors and stuff
wait
40 minutes go by i start wondering when it will arrive
start hearing a distant motorcycle honk
it keeps getting closer and closer
stops in front of my house, still honking
delivery guy starts making fucking rhythms with the honk
quickly go out to quiet the delivery guy
open door and he stops, but i can hear him panting like an animal
guy straight up yells my full name and my order 
awkwardly reply and take the pizza, already paid online
yells "thank you for your order" at the top of his lungs
jumps back to his bike and i go back to my door
i look back and see at least 4 different neighbor lights turning on
go inside
can hear him panting for like 5 minutes while trying to turn on the bike
when he does he straight up passes 3 gears in a split second while honking and drifts away
Im never ordering pizza at 2am again

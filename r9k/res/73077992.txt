My kindness is never reciprocated. If I had a button that would kill every human except myself I would certainly press it

there's nothing more annoying than the false kindness of the internet age, the kind of thing where people who may acknowledge your existence a few times a year say they "value you" and that they "consider you a friend", when really you know that if you blew your brains out and went offline forever they wouldn't even notice
kindness without consistency is usually just empty, masturbatory bullshit to make the giver feel like they're a good person

Fuck that, kindness has literally no material benefit.

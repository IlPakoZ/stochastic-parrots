saw small flashing lights in the dark
saw small flashing shades in the light
only in my peripheral vision, whatever
start seeing almost like silver balls on the walls in the middle of my vision
saw a white contour of a face flash on the black screen for a fraction of a second
its getting worse. i quit everything a week ago and its getting worse the longer i stay sober.
its not real but that doesn't really matter when its creepy as fuck for a nervous wreck like me.

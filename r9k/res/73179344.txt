you go on any dating app and every single white woman has multiple pictures of dogs on their profile. every white person has dogs screaming in their home and destroying it.

white people desperately want to convey friendliness for some reason
<comment>
it is only to dogs though. dog owners hate all other natural animals and only like dogs.
<comment>
because dogs are retards who have zero thinking whatsoever and this for some reason conveys fun animal

what is it with nonwhites and their obsession with white people? it just screams i have a racial inferiority complex and whites are on my mind 24/7
you go on any board on 4chan and shitskins make multiple posts about whites. every nonwhite is constantly screaming about white people and destroying their countries.
i never see white people obsessing with nonwhites online.

It fills the baby sized hole in their lives because kids are too expensive and too much work/responsibility. A dog is a compromise because they're needier than cats but not as needy as a child

social animal wants to convey friendliness

I think it started as mostly a white woman thing, but white men worked out that their women are attracted to men who post shit about their dogs (they think it makes them look kind-hearted and easygoing) so men did it for that reason. Later on people who had an unironic dog fascination took seeing this as their cue to come out and then the slippery slope increased to make mentally ill obsession with dogs and "dogs are better than humans" mentality normalise.
inb4 we always had a strong bond to dogs. They have been man's best friend for centuries when they helped us with x and y
The bond existed but it's not equivalent to the mentality today. Dogs would have actually been a burden to most people for which the dog was an extra mouth to feed for not enough practical gain to make up for it (farmers, hunters etc are the exception not the norm). That's not to say the companionship wasn't good enough reason for a lot of people, but still the dog would be seen as a pet moreso than a member of the family like it is today.

Everyone who has pets is retarded, evil, and anti-human

I work in a call center that raises funds for charities and it made me kinda hate animal people. They're this way for cats too. These people would rather donate money to save random "furbabies" than something that could actually help people or themselves one day. Cancer research? Starving children? Not even niggers over seas, kids in our own country? No thanks, I'm already donating to help "save" abused and neglected animals so a shelter can ultimately put then down humanely.
There is even a difference between getting donations to save pets vs wild animal environments. Raising funds to save or protect the local environment that contributes to the local economy through its mere existence is harder than trying to save fucking cats. 
It is infuriating.

Dogs are actually something families with kids have. it's educational when you're not a depraved empathy-bereft ape pretending to be a human being like what OP most likely is
95% of the time pets are an indulgence for overactive kids, but /r9k/ is too dumb to catch that, being obsessed with meme shit and pathologizing everything, unfortunatelly most anons on this board are dumb as bricks

Dogs are basically completely dependent on their owner for shelter, food, walks etc. 
A dog is submissive and even if you mistreat it, it usually comes back to you. 
I think most whites people are narcissists and like animals because animals are easier to control and subjugate than other humans.

meanwhile theres an entire board where thousands of white guys make 100,000 posts a day solely devoted to bitching about non whites

You clearly haven't seen bully breed breeders online, most of them are black and post their dogs all the time

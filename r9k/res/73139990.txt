I've become obsessed with playing the Powerball. I've spent several hundred dollars on it alone since January 1, 2023. I buy several tickets for every draw. 
If I don't win it, I have no chance in life. I have no chance at happiness. It's my only shot.

The lottery is a tax on the ignorant and hopeful.

I am desperate. It's my only chance in life. If I cannot win the lottery, I will simply never be happy.

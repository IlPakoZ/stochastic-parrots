I stopped caring about relationships and finding the right girl when I realized my penis wouldn't get any bigger.
Now I'm stuck with a 3.5 inch penis and a fulfilling life with no opposite sex companion.
Do you feel the same with having a small penis?
I lost interest in sex after realizing this too, theres not much you can do with a small dick. Have you ever seen small dick guys fuck, its like watching someone rub a clit against a wet spot.
Samara should put her toes in my mouth and soles on my face
Yes, I have the same feeling and my dick is already dead from the fapping, I gave up.
just find a nice girl who is willing to wait until marriage. sex really isnt everything. it can be used to cover up a lot of imperfections in the relationship. wouldnt you much rather have a qt that you get along with, agree, have lots of fun with and just overall enjoy her company or some vapid bitch who is only with you for your cock and you guys argue all the time?
What is your bodyfat percentage and how often do you do cardio? This information is very important, so reply as quickly as possible.
bf is 100% I do cardio always, I am constantly sprinting. in my sleep i shadow-box
It's giga over for you then, sorry. Not even fedposting, but I would commit a massacre if my dick was that small even while fit.

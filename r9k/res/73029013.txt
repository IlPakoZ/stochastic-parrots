How does it feel like to break a hymen with your penis? I feel like my life is incomplete without this. What's the point of doing anything if you can't have a virgin wife?

Most adult women already have a broken hymen even if they are virgins.
Trying to do a split breaks your hymen
Trying to ride a horse breaks your hymen
Exercising breaks your hymen
Riding a bike breaks your hymen
Masturbating breaks your hymen
etc.

This sounds like whore propaganda to me lol. I'm not saying its not possible but for how often I hear this kinda stuff repeated it sounds wayyyyy over-exaggerated.

"Would you say that infront of a crying child?!"

Most girls had their hymen taken by an older male family member. Usually their own dad. So maybe ask some dad's you know.

God, you're moronic. I broke mine trying to cartwheel off a chair when I was 9, most girls have a story like this. Get out of your echochamber.

Is this what you tell yourself when the repressed trauma becomes unbearable?

The fact that you don't understand what a vagina feels like be it on your dick or finger probably makes this entire thread moot

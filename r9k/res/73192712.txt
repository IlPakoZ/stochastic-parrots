<comment>
Because the politicians that run everything are old christian white guys whose wives don't have sex with them anymore so they want everyone to be as unhappy as they are
<comment>

<comment>
Chriscuckolds can't fight real crime because that cuts into the CIA's private prison industry so they need make up something else to pretend to virtue signal against and look tough on.
<comment>
Same reason as always anon
The stste needs more slaves
Too any women having abortionz?
Make that shit a "state" issue, make it harder for women to abort slaves
Too many dudes would rather wack the weasel then deal with women
Ban porn
Same shit new toilet

Aren't you tired of pornography? It's played out. A ban on massive platforms like Reddit will generate incredible amounts of seethe, and that is far more valuable.
<comment>
Reddit porn is the worst thing I have ever seen. Its literally all landwhales, turbowhores with a billion simps making a trillion dollars, cuckolding, trannies and racebait shit. It should be shut down.

men are not dating women
birth rate decline
men who do not date often do not participate in society
inb4 "SOCIETY OWE ME ITS THEIR FAULT"
to a degree it is your fault and to a degree its the environment you are raised in. Similar to how its very difficult for a drug addict to escape addiction when all of his friends are drug addicts, he is still to blame partly.
because these men do not participate, are unmotivated, and not helping society this causes alot of people (women) to be upset as they do not have any ability to save themselves , naturally being a supporting role to the man who is actively making choices. 
This causes women to suffer alot even if they are getting fucked daily they are still fairly miserable. You can refer to the old joke about how to make a woman miserable you just give her what she wants in life.
but why porn? why should i care
when males do not do things that benefit leaches the leaches will do what they can to make you miserable by taking away things you like.
but why?
miserable men will become depressed and angry which causes them to make stupid choices. These stupid choices on occasion are better than the choices they are already making like not participating in society.
should i care as a random anon on the internet?
no you are fine, do what you want as always.

I think this is more true than people want to admit. These old fucks had their fun and now want to punish everyone else.

I'm bored of porn. Looking at porn makes you bored of it. But some faggots can't control themselves and need the government to shut it down, all of it, not just focusing on the worse aspects of it and regulating that -- just ban it all -- which is going to lead to worse pendulum swings.
<comment>
Because pornography is garbage. Banning it is a good thing.
<comment>
Not true at all, prostitution booms in towns when politicians come to hold meetings, they all rape kids too
<comment>
Conservatives hate you and want you to spend your life breaking your back working for an unlivable wage until you drop dead of exhaustion
They use tranny shit as a distraction to get you upset about something so you dont notice you're being exploited as they come to take away even the smallest joy in your life
<comment>
I have mixed feelings on the radfem anti-porn politics thing. On the one hand, porn is bad, and should be banned. On the other hand I dislike how the radfem inspired discourse on porn demonizes men and makes female pornstars out to be like innocent victims or some shit, as if female stars don't end up being producers themselves after they graduate.

pornography is garbage
it's pretty great stuff, don't know what you're talking about.
<comment>
Porn should be banned, people don't realize that it's effectively one of the greatest dangers to society and will ultimately lead to civilizational collapse.
<comment>

Am I really the only one who's gonna tell this faggot to go back after 16 replies?
<comment>
You're on this site and probably a lot if I had to guess. Pot calling the kettle black here, dude.
<comment>
schizophrenic projection
no, really, how did you know?
<comment>
I hope so the world is over sexualized
<comment>
the fact that you're green texting and using it properly kind of makes my assumptions probable. have fun with whatever last thing you say.
<comment>
This is the equivalent of nuking a country because of its poverty problem
<comment>
No way bruh.
What am i gonna have to do to see lone naked women?
Pay for onlyfans????
Wtf is this
<comment>
i don't think it's not about morals, it's about centralization and money in the pockets of politicians. i really would not be surprised at all if any of these lobbyists had ties to porn studios directly
<comment>
being this much of a faggot about porn
OnlyFans is banned too.
ban porn
this benefits the porn studio :)
r9k is truly the most retarded board
<comment>
OP says porn on reddit, not porn. It makes sense from a financial perspective because what gets posted on nsfw reddit is free advertising from private creators or people posting (((illegal))) clips from porn studios.
<comment>
Absolutely based.
Coomers seething ITT.
<comment>
Clown take. The increase in porn is a direct result of the things that are leading to civilizational collapse already. Anyone thinking porn is the problem is the kind of retard who can't see the forest for the trees. Can we pinpoint any point in human history where sex wasn't readily and easily available to almost everyone? No, because brothels and cheap prostitutes were super commonplace in all eras. Can we pinpoint any point in human history where relationships weren't readily available to almost all? Again no, people have been consistently paired up and encouraged to pair up forever, even going beyond that to encourage people to stay paired up and shun those who don't. Literal slaves still had wives for christ sakes.
Banning porn will not make that happen again, because porn is not the cause of almost anything.
<comment>
There's been a huge push to do this everywhere, lately. I don't like porn and what it does to people, but I hate the censorship of free expression and content generation even more.
<comment>
Anti-Porn Lobbyists
Not Anti-Reddit Porn Lobbyists
<comment>
NOT MY HECKIN PORNOS!
THEY'RE GOOD BOIZ THEY DINDU NUFFIN!
<comment>
Seems like virtue signalling to me. It's basically impossible to shutdown porn from the internet and NSFW content on reddit is barely even a drop in the bucket compared to the sheer metric volume of the steer online in general. So they'll probably bully reddit into shutting down it's NSFW boards and call that a victory while nothing actually changes at all.
<comment>
Why are they coming For our porn ?
its bad for you anon, rots your brain
<comment>
Porn is a cause of the solution to the problem - societal upheaval - being hilariously delayed. You're a retard.
t. fag that has a twitter account that's just porn of himself
<comment>
5/10 3D women are losing value of their stinky STD ridden pre-fucked vagina
<comment>
I hope reddit does so it will finally die.
<comment>
I'm not arguing anything. I don't have skin in the game, I don't know shit. I have heard time and time again about how scummy lobbying is. I don't think it is outside the realm of possibility that a group such as that is being used to push an agenda that benefits big companies. It's not exactly conspiracy theory level thinking.
<comment>
it's not conspiracy level thinking
posts conspiracy level thinking
This board is retarded
<comment>
Touch grass, coomer retarded. Get a fucking grip...
<comment>
I like porn, I think its the crude beginnings of men having the ability to entertain themselves sexually without having to kowtow to women. I can't support shit like this because I think it will lead to blocking the advent of sexbots and high level sex VR, which is the real game changer. And the thing is you see no attempt to make dating and relationships with real women any easier for men, so supporting this is really just shooting ourselves in the foot. It will only increase the value of pussy and widen the gap between the haves and have nots in dating.

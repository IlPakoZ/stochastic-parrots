Did I do something wrong? It's been a week and she still won't talk to me
Maybe you dreamed the whole part about her inviting you to mcd. So from her point of view she was just called by some rando in her class.
Laugh if you want but it happened to me before
She sounds insane. You dodged a bullet. Anyways, next time try texting her instead. Calling might make people uncomfortable.
You coulda texted her instead
You should've picked the hour to show her who's boss and arrived late, anon.

Meet cute girl at uni
We have a lot of things in common
"Anon, wanna go to McDonalds with me tomorrow?"
Ask her what time
"Is 4 okay?"
Tell her yes
"Alright, see you there!"
Go to McDonalds at 3:28 to make sure I'm not late
Time passes 
4:12
Call her
"ANON WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU CALLING ME?"
Tell her she's still not there and that I was worried she forgot
She hangs up
Did I do something wrong? It's been a week and she still won't talk to me
Maybe you dreamed the whole part about her inviting you to mcd. So from her point of view she was just called by some rando in her class.
Laugh if you want but it happened to me before
She sounds insane. You dodged a bullet. Anyways, next time try texting her instead. Calling might make people uncomfortable.
You coulda texted her instead
You should've picked the hour to show her who's boss and arrived late, anon.

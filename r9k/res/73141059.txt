What are you doing here on a Saturday evening/night? Wouldn't it be better if we were outside with friends/gf?
no, after 25 it doesnt matter you're meant to marry the gf you've been dating since 19 at that stage. if you missed out on 18-25 you missed out on life and its pointless to pretend otherwise by trying after that.
Came back from a business trip and forgot to make plans for the weekend. No gf, still not sure if I currently want another. Gonna pour me a brandy and read a book.
im hungover and don't really like most people
I think my gf is in the psych ward but I'm truly not sure

Is it worth buying a chastity cage in order to aid a nofap? I'm on my 107th day and my penile sensitivity is very high by this point. Sometimes I get involuntary emissions just from the feeling of tightening skin on my glans during erections. 
Would a physical barrier around the penis, such as a chastity cage, aid with this and help prevent involuntary emissions?
<comment>
Possibly, but its also very cucked. 
AND not to mention the fact that nofap is a total meme made for/by retards. 7 day biological cycle renders it useless, just fap once a week and you will still reap the maximum benefit a long term nofap gives.

Wrong. Dead wrong.

source: Finnish shitposter larp

The source is a Finnish medical student. It was reposted to places like Reddit and 4chan.
<comment>
Also, just ignoring these sources yeah >>72986563
It talks about 3 weeks and longer periods of ejaculation abstention continually elevating testosterone levels, spermcount and benefiting heart and general body health.
<comment>
I am an American medical student. I have done extensive peer-reviewed research resulting in evidence that refutes your claims. Now what, Einstein?
Half of those sources aren't even relevant to the argument, and most of the remaining ones are correlation rather than causation. We're not talking about porn addiction, we're talking about fapping. Many people fap without porn.
As for the one source in that massive pasta that actually matters (the 3 week one), they only measured before and after, not during. Given that it was done over 3 weeks specifically, its very possible that they measured conducted the final measurement at the weekly peak of the test subjects, as per the weekly cycle.

You clearly haven't though. Idiot.

90% of them are.

LMFAO! Keep misusing a term you don't understand. Moron.

3 of the 12 or so studies mention porn. And 2 of those 3 mention masturbation in addition to porn. Only a single study is about porn on its own.

Not all of the studies were 3 weeks. Many were longer periods of time.

Okay so you have no problem believing looking at images and videos of people having sex somehow causes physical and mental harm but you absolutely refuse to believe that repeatedly masturbating and ejaculating and draining your body of a substance that literally has the power to create life has any negative consequences?
You know there are many species of animal that actually die upon ejaculation? Do you seriously think ejaculating doesn't take something out of a human being?
You are literally imparting a piece of yourself, of your genetic code, into someone else.

How do you know that, faggot? I am far more credible than the Finnish guy

Sorry, but just because you don't understand it doesn't mean others don't. Stop projecting.

A substance that is literally meant to be ejaculated, dumbfuck. If it doesn't get used within the week, it literally just gets broken down in your body anyways. You already created it, its not as if abstaining from cumming will cause your body to retain the resources and utilize them differently - its still gonna produce cum regardless.

hurr durr this random rat dies after cooming so uhhh obviously humans suffer after cooming too
BWAHAHAHAHA

And reabsorbed. Yes. Along with all the nutrients it contains. Mongoloid.
<comment>
Yes, reabsorbed. Only to be used for cum again. Troglodyte.

God you're stupid, and clueless. Read the studies. Spastic.

First line

Certainly not. I was once a chastity cage fetishist and I assure you they are useless for nofap.
The locks are easy to circumvent and even a cage with a very small gap between the cage and ring can be escaped with only minor discomfort.
The cage places a constant slight pressure on your penis, so it's more of an edging cage than a "chastity"cage. Naturally there's nothing stopping you from browsing porn while locked.
If you want to stop masturbating choosing to abstain of your own volition is the only way.
<comment>
Sounds like you're already at your goal. If you're going to cum it'll just happen anyway.
<comment>
My goal is Eternal Nofapdom. Reaching 100+ days was just the bare minimum threshold.

That might actually help the sensitivity though. The increased sensitivity is probably largely to do with a lack of touch, in addition to the increased hornyness and arousal. 
I think if you had constant pressure the odds of having an involuntary emission without touching whatsoever would be slimmer.

good job, cage your cock and seek a keyholder on fetlife. Fetishes are the easiest way for robots to get real sex
<comment>
Samuel, this really isn't a good idea for you. You have a cuck fetish. Wearing a chastity cage will probably just cause you to jizz even more.

My name is Michael McFlannagan. I am Irish. How did you know I was a cuckold?
<comment>
My conservative christian mother made me wear a chastity cage from age 13 and I still managed to jerk off. Willpower is the only thing keeping you from masturbating

you'll eventually just nut in your sleep

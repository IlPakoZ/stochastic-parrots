Can I post about my boyfriend?

clueless incel thinks getting a girlfriend solves your problems 
Ahahahaaha ohnononononono LMAO

Much like CC bans people that claim to be male, /r9k/ should ban people that claim to have gfs and stuff. Robots should reclaim this shithole.

My girlfriend does not like this thread.
<comment>
having a girlfriend means you're functional enough to get one, not that your problems were solved. you never had problems on the level of an incel, faggot. why do you want to be a loser so bad?
<comment>
The real are the faggots tat are posting about either getting a GF, maintaining a gf, why they can't get a gf and other trash like that
Incels are /r9k/ normies
<comment>
Thanks for letting me know that you're triggered by just my existence. I'll be sure to talk about my girlfriend whenever I can from now on.
<comment>
I agree,this board has been infiltration by normies 
They make fun of the few incel threads that pop up
Kill all normies

starvecel thinks getting food will solve all your problems
<comment>
godspeed anon. based thread
<comment>
if you're functional enough to make a post here, you should easily have a girlfriend anyway.
<comment>
It's almost like sealing yourself inside the house and being a NEET isn't a normal thing. People who think they are incels are that way by their own choice unironically.

Even literal downies have gfs, you are delusional. You don't realise that you're the one who wants to be a loser, right? Being 5'4 doesn't make you unfuckable, your cringe obsessive personality does it for you.
<comment>
Not every thread has to be demotivation, neeting, hiki, woman=bad, race bait, /pol/ bait, an hero, or incel posting. 
Learn to be a semi functional human being, it's really not hard.

Getting a girlfriend isn't hard. Women aren't some mysterious alien species that you need a fucking Rosetta stone to interpret. Take care of yourself and dont be so strongly autistic, and you could probably have one too.

yeah i'll just go win the lottery and then i'll get a girlfriend with my elite 4chan posting skills.
yeah i'm a cringe nonfunctional loser who can't leave the house, fuck me. everything is my fault because i haven't tried hard enough. 
it's sad that this board has basically turned into twitter 2.0. it sounds exactly the same. why are you faggots here when there're spaces catering to your viewpoints already? go shit on neets and the socially awkward there, people will love you for it. be with your kind.

At least you are self aware. That's the first step in change. It's good that you aren't like some of the people that post who think its okay to be a NEET.

<comment>

<comment>

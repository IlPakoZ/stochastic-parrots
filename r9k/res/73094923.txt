why does everyone hate me?
<comment>
Because they're jealous.
<comment>
because your skin is black.
<comment>
because you're my girlfriend
snuggle later?
<comment>
I don't know anything about you. Why don't you enlighten me?
<comment>
i didn't know iris drank coffee. i thought she drank robitussin and vodka
<comment>
Eh, I thought you were pretty funny, could really zone in on a gimmick though, maybe get into a fine art?
<comment>
of what?
that's not fair
im not your girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
<comment>
Let me translate this from femspeak *ehem* "Please pay attention to me"
<comment>
toon me
This picture was made from a real picture of Iris with her feet out and I demand she post it!
<comment>
bcus you are black and a woman
<comment>
a fine art? such as? 
im not good at painting or singing or drawing
i love coffee
its the only drug i will ever do 
eh was just scrolling archives, seems like a lot of people have pure hatred for me and i have no clue why
<comment>
Because youre black anon just stop being black its that easy
<comment>
eh was just scrolling archives, seems like a lot of people have pure hatred for me and i have no clue why
Did you do anything to earn that hate? Also, is it difficult as a black woman to style your hair? I always imagined it was a huge hassle.
<comment>
because you mocapped for that awful square enix game
<comment>
haha
true
im only here because im bored, cant fall asleep, and cant charge my switch
nop its a picrew
maybe thats what ill do till i can sleep, just make picrews, i think theres some new ones
i win oppression, if only i was gay and trans too
<comment>
i dont think this is really iris
<comment>
Just post them feet and I guarantee your popularity will soar through the roof
<comment>
im not your girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
but I'm a boy
<comment>
I think a violin would suit you well, sculpture/woodcarving are also easy to get into and don't rely on some intrinsic talent, an Iris woodcarving in a forest stream would go hard
<comment>
all i really did was shitpost, i never actually did anything bad to another person
Also, is it difficult as a black woman to style your hair? I always imagined it was a huge hassle.
yes
mocapped? what game?
<comment>
why not?
dont care, you can still be a gf
wow kinda funny you mention that because i used to play violin very well as a child. i cant anymore though. 
woodcarving in a forest stream would go hard
true, but i dont know how to woodcarve and i dont really like going outside
<comment>
haha
true
im only here because im bored, cant fall asleep, and cant charge my switch
Fair enough, seems like you got what you came for anyways
<comment>
why not?
why dont you tripfag on the responses?
<comment>
dont care, you can still be a gf
okay fine I guess I'll be your gf and shave my body and wear kneesocks and short skirts and cleavage window sweaters and let you be the big spoon while you tell me how much you love me and I tell you how I'm the luckiest girlfriend in the world 
I guess that's okay.

not really, nobody really seems to want to talk here. and im still bored and unable to sleep
<comment>
who is the most handsome guy you've met from 4chan?
<comment>
sucks you can't charge your switch
are you trying to finish botw before totk comes out?
<comment>
cause i feel guilty about being a tripfag
see, that's all i ask
picrel me and you
<comment>
Do you feel any exhaustion at all?
<comment>
you are, anon
yep. im on family trip and the outlets here are different, the converter thing i brought isnt working with that charger. whats botw and totk?
<comment>
God damn you are such an obnoxious attention whore
Where's your avatars frog face?
<comment>
not really, nobody really seems to want to talk here. and im still bored and unable to sleep 
That's too bad, I'd talk with you but I'm pretty tired
<comment>
nope :( its only 8pm in my regular time but way later here. how have you been btw? it's been a little while
<comment>
i don't really wanna dye my hair black though
whats botw and totk?
they are the zeldors
tears of the kingdom is the sequel of breath of the wild that drops sometime soon
<comment>
im on family trip
where? nigeria?
<comment>
you are, anon
maybe i actually am. describe me
<comment>
see, you are the person to answer op. why do you hate me? this seems pretty unnecessary to spend time editing that and insulting a stranger
it's ok, i get it. have a good sleep
<comment>
I've been pretty decent, lately been stressed out about exams and stuff but things are more chill now. How about you?
<comment>
i never actually did anything bad to another person
kek
<comment>
i don't really wanna dye my hair black though
why not, it would look nice
they are the zeldors
ohhh. all i play on my switch right now is sky children of the light, or stardew valley if i have no wifi. never tried zelda 
yes
kek
you type very handsomely and look beautiful in the sunlight
<comment>
You will never be artistic you will never be pretty you will never be creative you will never be a singer
<comment>
name one
i mean genuinely undeniably bad, like scamming people. having different opinions etc doesnt count
that's good that things got more chill. do you get a break from school around now? and ive been good, mostly just playing vidya
<comment>
im not good at painting or singing or drawing
These are all things you can work on, if you have any interest in them! No one is an expert when they start out.
<comment>
true but i don't really need those things anyways
<comment>
I don't hate you but I think you are annoying.
<comment>
where?
Paris
<comment>
you type very handsomely and look beautiful in the sunlight
that sounds very nice. kinda sounds like me. what do i wear?
<comment>
that's true, maybe out of those i would get into drawing/painting/sculpting, but its not like i care too much about getting good at that right now
<comment>
take some pictures in the nigerian nature or city
<comment>
that's fair, i can be seen as annoying depending on who im talking to
i think you dress in mostly black, dark blue, dark red or dark green. and wear boots or those male work/dressy shoes
<comment>
it would look nice
but like, I'd need to dye my eyebrows too, trying out a hair color changer website and it's so weird.
stardew valley 
have you ever played valheim? it scratched my lego and farming autism
my budy who has 3 gfs was telling me about this other game that's like stardew called sunhaven but I wasn't up to try it
<comment>
Lol shut up. you obviously know ur pretty but thats it. u have tons of simps.
<comment>
cuz you're the typical female. fishing for attention whilst pretending like you aren't some narcisisstic and filthy whore. 
just admit you come here for the male attention and validation and i'll stop hating you.
<comment>
male work/dressy shoes
Does this actually make someone more attractive??? Maybe my shoe choice is holding me back.
<comment>
just admit you come here for the male attention and validation and i'll stop hating you.
every girl on 4chan
<comment>
dye my eyebrows too, trying out a hair color changer website and it's so weird.
are you blonde? can i see the colour changer results
have you ever played valheim? 
no, ive been meaning to for a little while but havent had a chance. i play more other games on my pc, i just dont have it with me
my budy who has 3 gfs
why does he have 3 gfs??
im,, not gonna argue this today, its cringe to be self hating even if im only speaking objectively
<comment>
i think you dress in mostly black, dark blue...
very, very accurate iris. what music do you think i listen to?
<comment>
im,, not gonna argue this today
Its not a matter of arguing, its knowing its s true
<comment>
ive admitted so many times that i came here for attention, what else would it be? you're looking for meaningful discussions or connections on r9k of all boards? 
what type of shoes do you like to wear? i like many types of styles on guys, hang on ill make a collage
<comment>
youre not even annoying, just boring. For some reason you still get attention, im not sure why. i feel like thats a little weird and unfair. at least when i post trying to get men on this site to orbit me i try to be funny or interesting or at least post tits or something, but you just sort of exist and for some reason people care. that annoys me a little, not gonna lie, though it confuses me more than anything.
but i dont think i hate you. partially because i think youre cute and not causing any real harm, and partially because theres not much to hate, like i said you havent really shown much personality on this site.
<comment>
Because youre boring as fuck and no, playing vidya is not a hobby
<comment>
what type of shoes do you like to wear?
I am actually so lazy when it comes to shoe choice. Whatever fits and looks... passable, I will wear. I think I prefer the way sneakers look, though, and I want to transition to wearing sneakers if I ever stop being lazy long enough to go pull them out from wherever I put them.
<comment>
do you have project zomboid iris?
<comment>
Do you want me to orbit you? You seem cute.
<comment>
sorry but black women = ugly NIGRESS..........
<comment>
this isnt tied to my trip so i can admit that no, im not, im tall and ugly and fat and mannish and i only look hot from like 3 angles. i exclusively take photos of my body after ive starved myself for at least a day because it makes my stomach sink in a little bit. you do not want me and the only way i get anyone to want me is via levels of mindgames you cant begin to imagine
<comment>
sorry, this was meant for this person
<comment>
are you blonde? can i see the colour changer results
i am but not super blonde
color changer sucks
why does he have 3 gfs??
he was describing it yesterday but I didn't really get it, said it was kickass being poly because everyone's happy and their happiness if his girlfriends happiness which is his other girlfriend's happiness 
it's like a chain reaction i guess when good stuff happens.
he's one of those charismatic "b urself" types even though he doesn't want our other friends to know he has multiple girlfriends yet because he's self conscious
<comment>
You mean aside from the narcissisms and constant attention whoring?
<comment>
Ummm... can I please have some context for these messages, anon?
<comment>
NEVER MIND I have reading comprehension issues.
We can still be friends or something!
<comment>
ive admitted so many times that i came here for attention
This is the reason people hate you, also you're a slut with a huge victim complex when your life is ungodly easy.

How do you not get bored of the same 12 images?
<comment>
Dude, I wish Poco would draw more pictures of Mio, I really do. But I am working with a limited set here. Of course, I could take images of the other girls he draws, but I don't really want to expand my image collection at the moment.
<comment>
yo iris idk if you're reading this but i actually like you, not in a simp way but some of the things i think you say are cool and also we're from the same general area so i relate to you in a sense. anyways ganbarre anon, fuck the haters ya know?
<comment>
i like these male styles
so you dislike me for being boring? that's it? and what type of funny and interesting posts do you make, let me take notes. kinda hurts but you have a point. last insteresting thing i did was pretending to kms, but ive just grown out of that drama type of stuff. i can be funny sometimes, im just embarrassed/shy to say the things on my mind. ahg. i wish my problem was something more easy to change. not posting tits though, it would be too desperate and 
how is vidya not a hobby. it is.
i see i see
i wear sneakers most of the time too, i like the plain black and white converse
<comment>
I think Converse would be good! Thanks for the collage Iry.
<comment>
so you hate me because of lies made up to make me look bad. and hate me for liking attention, despite the fact that all you do is make posts to garner negative attention? you're the biggest hypocrite on this board and just mean
thanks. i appreciate that desu. this place is so demoralizing, i forgot how bad it was during my break. hope you're doing well and good luck 
yes theyre so comfy and simple, my favourite shoe for every day
do you like the gatekeeper anon? you seem so friendly even to people who are rude to you

What about these? Gelbooru says the character is original for all of them, but these two look quite similar and have a similar astatic. 
"yeah I really just like generic tiktok chad eboys"
Is this a LARP? Lol.
I don't think any of those are lies. You've never shown a shred of evidence they are. If you want to attention whore, at least have a unique personality. I don't hate all attention whores, personally.
Also you're a slut despite the evidence being true or not by your own admission. You just disagree with most here on what being a slut is lol.
<comment>
do you like the gatekeeper anon? you seem so friendly even to people who are rude to you
I actually do, but I understand that he may come off as rude to people. (Well I guess he actually is quite rude, if I think about his responses.)
<comment>
I didn't try to be rude to you when replying ITT. I am rude often, though. But this is 4chan, so I assume most people can handle me calling them a normalfag or whatever.
<comment>
I've seen these images and identified that they are not Mio by looking at the details in the image. And I am specifically dedicated to posting Mio until I change my mind.
My Mio collection on my PC is actually more up to date than the one on my phone - I just have 4chan blocked on my PC right now.
You are nice to me, I know! I was talking about your other responses.
<comment>
that's not fair
why should it be?
<comment>
Where is mio from? I am just a fan of the aesthetic of avatarfagging, but I think just having 10-20 images like OP/you gets old. It does work better to be noticeable, though, like the ameposter who only had 1-2 main images.
<comment>
Mio seems to be Poco's OC - I know nothing else about her. Check out the figure of her! I wish I had one...
like the ameposter who only had 1-2 main images.
Ameposter had more variations than just 2, and would switch to other vtubers when running out of Ame.
<comment>
i see
well good 
i just like that male art hoe style. its about the clothes and not the face/body. and all guys here post women like picrel anyways. i dont wanna argue with you anymore. i wish you didnt hate me so much and try to make every person who is nice to me hate me too. can you please just stop. why are you nice to that anon but mean to me. i never did anything to you in the first place but you just want to hurt me
<comment>
because of lies made up to make me look bad
they are not lies. They are true. They are ALL true. Enough with the innocent shit act youre a BPD attention grabbing ewhore
<comment>
now i will be ignored in my thread 
you two have fun
i guess you agree with what they say about me too mio anon
<comment>
Hey come on, dont be so hard on yourself anon. Im sure youre not that bad at all.
<comment>
it's snuggle time
<comment>
You can buy a figure of her and I know he used more pics than just 2 but his main ones were very memorable because they were the top 2 ones he posted by a lightyear. He posted on /qa/ back in the day about how much he hated racebait posts and it was very easy for me to spot him here even while barely thinking about/reading his posts.
its about the clothes and not the face/body
That's why they're all chad eboys lol.
guys here post women like picrel anyways
Irrelevant. I think most guys here are superficial too.
i guess you agree with what they say about me too mio anon
Pretty sure this is someone LARPing, but this is insanely pathetic either way lol.
<comment>
i just like that male art hoe style.
I like it too but I am not nearly as tall or attractive.
It's literally been like, 5 minutes! Here I am!!!
<comment>
Pretty sure this is someone LARPing, but this is insanely pathetic either way lol.
I FELL FOR IT THEN
He posted on /qa/ back in the day about how much he hated racebait posts and it was very easy for me to spot him here even while barely thinking about/reading his posts
I did not know that! Interesting history.
<comment>
i like these male styles
you have good taste iris. 
so you dislike me for being boring? that's it?
yeah, basically. i dont think you deserve to be at the top of the board as often as you are. that sounds like im mad at you, im not, im mostly mad at the people who put you there (im aware im one of them but still). 
 what type of funny and interesting posts do you make, let me take notes.
well, most of my best posts are untripped desu. but here are some examples that i think were pretty good (keeping it vague obvi)
a LOT of /adv posts, completely fabricated but the stories are calculated to keep them at the top of the board for as long as they possibly can be. when they start losing steam i add a reply that reveals a startling new thing about the situation to keep people replying
long updates on my life and friends, with reocurring characters and plotlines to incentivize people to read/listen to as many as they can find (on this board). 
drawthreads 
i actually argue with people and get pissed off, im not just this fawning wide eyed childish bring hard to hate character you seem to portray yourself as
sometimes i track people back by the images they use and find their discord, or on rare occasions even their normal social media and dm them screenshots of incriminating posts they make (i dont do anything with them its just funny to watch them lose their shit and beg me for mercy)
sometimes i start avatarfagging for a few weeks till i get noticed, coming up with a whole character and personality for the person behind the avatar, developing the character between the posts. usually i get tired of it after about a month or two tho
<comment>
theres more, but this is my main stuff im doing atm. desu idk what to tell you to do since you seem to be being totally genuine about the whole tripfagging thing, like your trips personality is apparently just you?
thats just kinda boring imo, if i committed to posting face in an identifiable way i would use it to craft a big narrative, i actually have a lot of ideas for plotlines (if things go the way i plan my death will be very public, and i think it would be fun to do a big online narrative leading up to it so when people see me on the news theyll be like "wait is that that crazy chick i know from r9k?" and then have a whole job of untangling what parts of my online personas were real and which were fake, my current blog is already planned to be a part of this) 
idk, just like, comitt to things more? i think thats the thing that would make me like you more. like, i respect someone whos wrong, or an asshole, or annoying but leans in and fully commits way more than someone who bends to whatever people tell her. youre some sort of gamer right? use that, idk.
i think if i were in your position i would try to lean in to playing myself up as the perfect r9k boys dream of a skinny young gamer gf, maybe make some racists feel conflicted, start a controversy over the people that love you vs the people that hate you (though like i said, youd have to be a lot more opinionated to get anyone to truly HATE you).
<comment>
i got the images off pinterest, they use models. i just liked the clothing style. im nowhere near as attractive as the women i take clothing inspo from but i like the clothes anyways. like pic rel
Pretty sure this is someone LARPing, but this is insanely pathetic either way lol
why is it pathetic? you just came in here to try and turn people against me. youve hated me since forever and its just tiring. i cant even talk to people in my own thread anymore because you come to start some derailing argument or be mean to me. it really just gets tiring
ok gf lets do it
pls
its not a larp
oh well
didnt mean to be annoying, and youre nice to me at least, just see you being chummy with the person who hates and bullies me tons and took it as a sign
<comment>
Let me orbit you pls gamer girl
Me liking him doesn't mean I don't like you!
<comment>
Trip or LARP.
why is it pathetic?
You're trying to guilt a poster who's nice to everyone into lapping at your feet.
Also, I really only mildly dislike you. I just think you're a boring slut who has a massive victim complex.
<comment>
well i cant be bothered to spend all day farming attention on 4chan ngl, i like to stream but staying on here all day like i used to is just boring now.
i actually argue with people and get pissed off, 
i dont think youve been in my threads then. i used to do that all the time. eventually i just got tired. i would like to put more effort in to crafting an interesting personality but i think i'm just too tired of it all these days. i just want to be calm and liked. kinda funny how despite that theres people like gatekeeper anon who hate me with a passion
also i think the main reason i continue showing up on the board is just the fact that i stayed for so long under the same persona. back when i changed it often nobody really gave me as much attention. if you just posted face and stuck to one persona, im sure people would care about you much more than me quickly
<comment>
i would recommend you that in your new arc you posted feet. that would be 100 fr based af lmao.
<comment>
its me, i realize how the post came across so ill take it back. just felt like everyone was siding with you. im not a slut. and i dont have a victim complex. can you please just stop talking to me if you dislike me, instead of being mean to me all the time and going into my threads just to repost fake screenshots from 6 months ago. i wont bother you in your threads anymore. just please can we be amicable or just away from each othwr. i dont have the drive to win at these things like i used to. just please stop 
well thanks.
<comment>
idk for someone who sure says they are tired of it all constantly and wants to be calm you seem to post here a lot and cause drama lol.
<comment>
sometimes i track people back by the images they use and find their discord, or on rare occasions even their normal social media and dm them screenshots of incriminating posts they make (i dont do anything with them its just funny to watch them lose their shit and beg me for mercy)
I would cry if you did this to me. Anyway, I respect the 4chan grind. I don't think I post here for that, though. Being honest is probably not the best way to go on here lol
<comment>
i havent even posted here properly in about a month i think? i literally just eat and sleep and play vidya. what drama did i cause at all recently?
i would like to be better and more likable than i used to be at least.
<comment>
im not a slut
Well with your definition, maybe, but not by the views of most on /r9k/ when you lay out of the story of someone losing their virginity to some e-chad just to experience le sexerino.
i dont have a victim complex
Do you remember what the OP says? You've also said so many times about how living as a woman is not tutorial mode when you constantly prove it is.
just please stop
When I get bored of it.
What is the drama? Lol. It's just "oh no i'm so bored... plz gib attention" or threads like this about how someone said she's a not actually an 8/10.
They're probably creatively writing ITT.
<comment>
Let me orbit you pls gamer girl
i never said i was a gamer lmao. i literally only play tf2 these days. iris is the gamer here apparently. my primary hobbies are the internet and archival projects related to it. also firearms
thats fair honestly. you dont have to put in work to get attention (as exemplified in this thread) and if you wanna post stuff like this good on you honestly. i think i respect you a lil more after this interaction.
desu i havent paid attention to you a lot, i read a couple of your threads like 2y ago, read an agatha2 thread, watched a couple youtube videos, and decided i wasnt interested and have kind of ignored you since. i mean, youre beautiful, youve got lovely gamine features, but you dont appeal to me much beyond that. ill keep the thing about longevity in mind, maybe ill start something like that. ive started trips that were supposed to be "genuine mains" a few timesbut i just dont have the self control not to spoil them by either lying pathologically on them or posting revealing info/pics and then regretting it, and then i abandon them. maybe ill try again so i can reap the fruits in a few years like you are here.
<comment>
ok fine, according to r9k users, im a slut because of my body count of one. and im a normie who could find a bf if i wanted to. will you be nice to me now?
like this about how someone said she's a not actually an 8/10.
no, i just made this thread after reading archive posts saying all sorts of mean things about me, even after id been gone and not causing any problems for so long. im not an 8/10.
<comment>
They're probably creatively writing ITT.
people never believe me when i say this (fair, you have no reason to) but im actually being weirdly honest rn. i mean, im never 100% honest, but most of what ive said in this thread is true, and all the stuff i said about my posting habits is true. i try not to lie to women too much, i think fembots on this board should have a certain kind of comradery
<comment>
because of my body count of one
Because you had casual sex, rather. If you had one bf and fucked him, then it'd be very bizarre to see you as a slut unless you're an ultra puritan christfag.
im a normie who could find a bf if i wanted to
Well you're just lying to appease me.
Also, I was using hyperbole, but I mean the point is your life is incredibly easy, you have loads of simps and guys who'd bf you in an instant if you wanted and would let you be a NEET all day but you still make threads implying you're a victim.
None of you people are or ever were robots.
<comment>
ive said iris is kind before in other threads and you have called me a simp blablablba which im not. 
i think your hate is personal kek
<comment>
why does everyone hate me?
Mgtow
<comment>
Well I'm personally disgusted by sluts/simps, but it's not hatred.
<comment>
sounds like le projecting kek

Would you wear this shirt when you go out??
Omg yesssss (pleading face emoji)
If it was in a good cut then yeah. Tight around the shoulders and chest etc.
Humans would be going up to you wanting hugs
I know I would
That sounds like a very annoying issue to have to deal with I may have to reconsider my choices
I would wear the shirt so that humans find me more approachable. So I can hurt them more easily.
It's a funny shirt so I would wear it. Everything is better than some shit like pic rel. Hollow irony is miles better than just hollowness.
Plain= Nice design/colouring>something like pic rel (only if you can pull it off)>>>>>Brand name design>>>>>>>>>>>>Plain Brand name design
No but I would unironically wear this one
All of the creatures in this thread are sooooooooo cuuuuuuteeeeeee!!!
I hope you all buy the I &lt;3 Humans shirt and get other humans to wear them cause that would be so cute!!!
yes 
I think I should buy it
It would look funny since my resting face looks pretty angry so

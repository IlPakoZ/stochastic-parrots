Why are good people being punished?

Its not that. Since I have violated many taboos. It doesnt make it better when I have to listen to what people are saying outside my house. What is apparently some problem with my yard work or something. I am too sensitive to hostility, it is like torture.

Noone is being punished. This is a war. You either fight,die or die fighting.

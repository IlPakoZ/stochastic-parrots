I don't whether this will be taken again by coomer mods, I'll say it again and again, masturbation and porn are the most harmful and dangerous things for the modern man. It completely sapped my energy, willpower and decisiveness throught my 20s.and turned me into a timid bitch.disgusted of myself. The only times when I felt in control and content with myself, having a huge drive for working out and meeting women, were when I was on nofap, but would quickly relapse and plunge back into depression.
It all started in middle school when a classmate showed a video of a blowjob, and then I would get into hentai, femdom and other shit until I finally got into camming whores and would spend half of my salary on them and miss meetings because of agressive masturbation, all while isolating myself from real women.
Now I am jobless, girlfriendless for a while and in my late 20s. I have an internet window with tabs of all the women that I really liked and met while I was on my nofap sprees. Each time the urge comes I look at those and think of how good would've been if I stayed a man and didn't destroy my chances by relapsing.

Chuds dont want to change. They are too angry and narcissistic to question their habits. They believe they deserve everything just because they imagined a future where they had everything. That fantasy is enough to make them believe they deserve it. Telling them to stop wanking will make them angry because they want to do everything without consequence and have everything without doing anything. Chud mindset

That's what I told myself also, but eventually plain porn became not enough anymore.
The fact that I actually got together with a girl while on a nofap spree and completely ruined with with relapsing which caused her to leave me tells me otherwise.

I'm glad you found an external factor to blame for all your problems and failures in life. Now you don't have to do anything with your life. The great almighty porn did it, not you so it's OK. It's not your fault and nothing can be done about it. For many people a total lack of agency is very comforting thought.

For many people a lack of understand of the forces aligned against you and "IT'S ALL YOU BRUHH" is a very comforting thought.

They aren't as common, unfortunately.
<comment>
On the contrary, people who are oblivious to external factors targeting them and keep falling in the same traps while expecting different results seem to be rather the norm, unfortunately.

Porn is far more enjoyable than sex, though. Far less mental bullshit and no worrying about diseases and pregnancies.

Nofap makes you a good little slave. That's why they used to cut off the foreskin. So they couldn't whack it and be better slaves.
<comment>
Pregnanciy should be your last worry
What part of emulating a vagina with your hands makes you not a slave retard

Porn is harmless, but weak people like to blame it for them failing to be worth anything. They should be ashamed of themselves. It's even more ridiculous than claiming astrology made them losers. Porn has had no effects on me. I think I'm pretty great but nofappers believe I'm a demigod. I'm just not a retard.
<comment>
I think porn, no exaggeration, has been one of, if not, the worst thing to ever happen to my life. I basically turned myself into a faggot with it. It has ultimately done absolutely nothing good for me whatsoever, and has rotted my mind. God help me.

Hate to break it to you but straight men aren't faggots. If you're masturbating to material with penises it's because you like that kind of thing. No amount of hurr durr I self insert as the man doe will convince me otherwise. Porn doesn't have any influence whatsoever on a persons tastes, kinks, fetishes, preferences, or whatever you want to call it. The slippery slope is nothing more than people getting better at finding what they like and accepting that they like weird shit. No need to self flagellate over it but don't blame porn for it. You chose to watch it, you wouldn't do that if you didn't like it.

Complete and total bullshit and I know it for a fact. Neuroplasticity is a thing and in the absence of porn I would never have gotten to the point I have, I never got off to faggot stuff of all sorts which I have before looking at porn and none of it ever occured to me, I never once had a homosexual fantasy or anything like that until after consuming porn for years. It began with traps, and it went downhill from there. I am not saying that looking at porn can make you just like a full on faggot (though I don't know if the commonly accepted premise of homosexuals is even true so maybe it can contribute to that).

Absolutely retarded bullshit. There is probably no point in arguing with you, but I know from experience this just is not true.
<comment>
You are dishonest with yourself and about your experience.
<comment>
I know myself better than you ever will and I know my experience. If anybody here is being dishonest I'd suspect it is you, because if you are into stuff that isn't good, and you look at porn, you could then justify it, and would be absolved of the guilt.
<comment>
You're probably correct for any dude who's within a stone's throw of normal and able to get pussy. I am not that dude and never will be.
<comment>
Lmao
I'm not the one masturbating to men
<comment>
I was not accusing you, I was just saying a possibility.

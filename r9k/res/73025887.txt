so 90% of zoomer rap is just guys tweaking on krank / pcp and shouting random stuff over autotune?

Keep in mind these guys are the 2 most popular rappers that dedicate their music entirely to zoomers / gen Alpha, this is what your children idolize.

This. We are currently in the stage of western society where people have gotten so lazy, they consider themselves too good to even uphold the status quo. Hence art, infrastructure, academia, science are all deteriorating. The popular music of today makes the mindless shit that pushed out on a daily basis 90 years ago look like Beethoven.

modern music is just mutts talking over generic beats made by other mutts and then produced by jews
and if you realise this and call it out they insist it's just as valid and good as music as the past where people actually played instruments, knew theory, etc
watch some mutt/zoom reply to me in anger, posting clips of some mutt rapper who's totally not like the rest

This exactly. Nice thing about them is how quickly they prove their retardation once questioned, particularly if you know anything about theory. Once you do, they instantly hide behind relativism - "y-yeah, who are you to say that something that sounds good, is more elegantly composed and is more complex than a children's song is better than something that isn't? BIGOT!!" It's all they have as soon as you ask a single question.

Western society should uphold the highest standards of art and beauty, and destroy dissenters, but there should also be a place for white sissyes to be effeminized.

Glorifying European sissies and fucking their bums is trad.

My little sister only listens to kpop and consumes kdramas. While its not exactly good that she is thinking about Korean men all the time, at least the media she consumes is far more wholesome and less ugly and crass than disgusting tranny shows and nig rappers singing about drugs and anal while twerking.

Well? How do you know ? Personally I'm an antirealist with regards to all value.
<comment>
Proof bc 4chins is retarded

antirealist
Before I even begin, explain what that means to you.I wanna know whether it's worth explaining or not.

Honestly I dont even know why or how kpop became so popular with girls. 99% of it must be the "beautiful boy" appeal or do kpop bands actually make good enough music that makes you want to jam out even if you don't understand the lyrics? I can get active to J-rock because it evokes emotions and makes me want to jump around and spazz out despite not knowing most of what they say and making me think of my favourite anime.

I think the idea of something being "better" or "more valuable" than something else comes from our emotions and is not in the thing itself. Therefore it's impossible to truly state that anything is in some way better than anything else. I apply thus to all values, moral and artistic.
<comment>
not him but let me step on your balls and tell me how anti-real that feels? or how about I suck your dick and tell me how that's not real, faggot. hahahaha
<comment>
This is a lazy response. Obviously our emotional reactions to things are exist in our mind. What I'm questioning is whether they in real in the way the physical attributes of a thing are real. That is, having existence outside of our heads, like how the height of an object is objectively the case.

I'm a terrible typist. I apologize for the typos in this.

Ah, I see. That seems alright, cause it sounds like you can still acknowledge that using the lens of us and our emotions, something can still be considered to be higher or lower in value.
To not get too bogged down in details, cadences for example are short harmonic progressions that give any person, no matter the cultural background, a feeling of resolution, which proves that there is something innate to how we experience music. That's the first thing. Next, thanks to things like cadences, we know that music and its enjoyment is built on elegantly developing and then getting rid of tension. There are many different ways to do so, from rhythmic syncopation to chromaticism in a harmonic progression to the structure of a piece (the sonata form being a good example, with its usual early key changes and mixing of motifs building tension which is then done away with and ended with simplicity in the recapitulation.) The trend since around the beginning of the 20th century (arguably earlier) has been toward immediacy, for many reasons, many involving how the role of music has changed due to technology in particular. The ways that today's popular music builds tension and resolves it have become extremely simplistic, comparable to that of children's music. (In fact, if you go back a couple decades and look at popular children's music, you might even find compositions that might sound "jazzy" or "classical" to the ears of someone currently in their teens.) Again, this has its uses in how immediate the experience is and how easily digestible it is, particularly now that music has evolved to be something to be experienced in tiny bites as background noise. It also means it's objectively incapable of experiences as intense as the music of earlier decades and centuries, and its creators less capable, too, since composers capable of composing musc of te past could very easily make music in the vein of today's popular music, which isn't true the other way around.

This is fair enough.

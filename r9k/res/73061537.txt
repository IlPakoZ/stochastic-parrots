I bought a gift card from the store, and Google literally stole the money. They said they "need more info" when redeeming, so I had to upload the receipt. Lots of people online are saying this happened to them and never got the money back. Other companies like Amazon do this too, how do they just get away with scamming people?
Same with paypal. What are you going to do; take some of the largest corporations on earth to court and sue them?
They hold your money for 180 days or whatever which isn't good but they don't steal it

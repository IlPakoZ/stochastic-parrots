I live in Texas and we're getting so flooded with California (and other) refugees that a mid 1 bedroom apartment is like 2k lmao a few years ago I rented a nice 1 bedroom apartment for 900 a month plus utilities.
Same thing in Arizona. Califags are also flooding Idaho.
Like rats from a sinking ship lol too bad they're loaded as fuck and buying up everything here. Sold their 1 bedroom condo on skid row and bought 3 mcmansions here, two to rent out.
My dream is to get roommates so I can work minimum hours part time and survive paycheck to paycheck. Best cities to do this in?

They usually don't. But when they are in media stuff, it helps feed into the progressive persona they build up for themselves where they pretend to be accepting towards gender-non-comforming men (who probably make up a substantial amount of their viewerbase). So, basically pandering to lonely woke unconventional men

It's living out their need in an acceptable environment. No scratch that, it's living out their degenerate nature that is a semi-consenting form of control/child raising. In this case the lower status manlet will be taken advantage of by actual sociopathic tendencies. Mother's raise their kids will love and want them to succeed mostly and in this case it's just pure puppeteering and dominance without any of the mother's loving nature. Kind of like a twisted version of stockholm syndrom for men.

Thinking about these last messages that she sent me last night..... bros. It made my chest hurt like hell I couldn't sleep that night, I know to damn well I am in the friendzone. Shit if I was someone she really liked she make time to use couple minutes of her time. Had a nightmare last night that I was doing boxing the most masculine sport thinking it will win her over. But she is gagging with her friends over about some faggot in the water polo team.

What's her discord? I can DM and ask her for you.

Well at least she was very up front and blunt about it. Not to say that shit doesn't hurt. Sucks you're having nightmares about it. For what its worth you handled it very well. Nothing worse than embarrassing yourself by being a little bitch.
Just gotta get out there and try again. Thats how it goes for the most of us.

i despise people who text with capitalization and punctuation. it feels too formal like you're typing a damn business email, there's no personality involved whatsoever in those texts
so fucking dry
it really makes me irrationally angry, like i'm talking to chatGPT or something

I despise retards who can't spare the two fucking seconds to use proper punctuation and grammar for readability. It reads like a slurring child. Especially when the subject matter is serious. Those conventions are there to help communicate, and you're too lazy or stupid to use them.

how serious can discord conversations be you retard
go call someone then you dumb fuck. 
soulless NPC, you didn't sign your comment with your credentials and a 'kind regards' so i can't take it seriously sorry. oops

NTA, but credentials and "kind regards" are formal communications for letters only. You also used "NPC", which doesn't fit very well, considering NPCs tend to not use standard writing conventions in anything besides formal writing. It's actually quite rare for me to see someone who writes like an educated adult in real life. All this to say, your "personality" is 
not shown by your misspelling of words, or your casual disregard for punctuation. It's shown by the words you choose, and the order you choose to say them in. The use of punctuation and spelling are purely for pragmatic reasons.

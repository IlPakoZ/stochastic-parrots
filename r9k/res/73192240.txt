Why do men here worship egirl sluts and admonish those in cute loving relationships?
all girl r the same
I'm right here desu. I despise attention whores and just want a cute, loving monogamous relationship. There's just no point in interacting with the /soc/ tier attentionwhore threads so I just filter them.
I'm absolutely a hopeless romantic, which is why on any given day there's a 90% chance I'm wallowing in heartbreak.
Got literally dumped two times consequtively over having too low of a libido and preffering to obstain from sex before dating for over a mounth.
Left a very sour taste in my mouth when it comes to romantics. Women are hornier than men sometimes.
I'm here. I just want a girl that makes every second of my life cute and wholesome.
I lurk, mostly. I've taken my shot every now and then with the odd girl I've had pleasant conversations with on this site(not just this board, this board is absolutely the worst even if it does have people who are hikineets like me) and they always end up ghosting me. Girls don't want spergy NEETs with no futures, it is what it is.

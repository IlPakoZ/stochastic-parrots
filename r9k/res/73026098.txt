be me, going to work
packed train but managed to secure a seat
somewhat long ride, so decide to play some vidya
fire up some good ol' pixel gun 3d
play survival for as many rounds as I can
the woman next to me keeps glancing at my phone, idk why
realize it's because of the pet mammoth I named "hairy nigger"
I close the game and put my phone back in my pocket for the remainder of the ride.
Thank god I my company doesn't have company shirts or else she would have probably called my boss, and I would have been fucked.

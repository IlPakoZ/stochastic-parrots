I can't tell if she's inviting me as a friend or as a potential mate. any ideas? I feel like I already friendzoned myself by being a bitch, but part of me feels like I can still get something out of this.
You did it, Anon!
If she didn't feel the same way, she would've told you upfront. I may not be all that bright, but a woman inviting you for drinks immediately after you confess your feelings sounds like a win to me.
Cease the moment, Anon. You've won!
Staying in a relationship with a guy she doesn't like is a red flag, she will eventually do the same to you.
if she knows you like her and still invites you over for drinks then it's just her making a move. also don't date her she will fuck you over.
She's trying to be a coy little retard. Don't worry anon. I think you've got this one in the bag, just don't fuck it up.

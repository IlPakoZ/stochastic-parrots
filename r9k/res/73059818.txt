How is this even possible? Did you ever go to high school?
Abyss here. Keep up the good work. I'm proud of you.
hi yes my hobby is reading
wow anon I can't believe you are one of the few people alive that can read words
holy fuck when did browsing the internet become a hobby people brag about.
don't fucking talk to him like that
since when does a hobby have to be something someone brags about? I lift hundreds of pounds every day, it's my hobby but I don't really care what other people's opinion is of it
Reading means reading books. Not a lot of people read books these days. You know what else you can do with a book?
*bashes you in the head with a big thick heavy book*
What now, huh? What now, bitch? That's right, nothing.
Here is one of my fishy friends

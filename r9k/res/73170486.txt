move to san francisco
have conversation at workplace
mention I lived in a red state previously
they all start distancing themselves
Why the fuck are Californians so passive aggressive and gay? I can't stand this fucking shit.
Their faux-progressivism pisses me off, especially since SF is more socially conservative (racist, classist, and sexist) than my home state.

Beat them to establish dominance, they're a bunch of faggy pushovers who'll fear any social or physical coercion
<comment>
Just goes to show they blindly follow ideology, considering you were in a red state and actively chose to move to a blue state. Would that not mean, presumably, that you have similar beliefs to them? No, automatically you are an evil bigot. 
San Fran is also gay central, the most passive aggressive motherfuckers.
<comment>
Yes, but they all hide it. Everyone just virtue signals here.
Same racist shit just a different color and in cold fucking denial.

It's always nice when the people who preach for tolerance and whatnot end up being highly intolerant

Yeah I can tell you're from out of state. California is the corporate version of East Germany. The corporations here literally have more rights than the average citizen. For example, the red flag law is written so that your employer, or your coworkers with permission from the corp, can accuse you of being a "potential mass shooter" and the state is legally obligated to SWAT you. Meanwhile even if your boss is openly musing about shooting you with his fancy new hunting rifle your labor bought him there is jack fucking shit you can do about it since the corp is never going to give you permission. Your fellow employees aren't much better since they're a bunch of narcissistic yuppie fucks that love playing office fuck-fuck games. 
It's so bad that as late as ~5 years ago, if they would slander you as a republican and do all the shit described in the OP if they found out you ever lived in a "red" county in the state. Hell, I know kids from my home town who just list the general region of the state (norcal/socal) to avoid trouble. I can't imagine how much worse it could have gotten after COVID mindbroke everyone.

That's just most normies are right now. Everyone has sensational political content being driven up their ass. They are in pain from being probed by our lovely politicians in the ass. so the slightest bad vibe will set them off.

How is SF conservative in any sort of way
<comment>
The only thing this shows is that they're addicted to feeling righteous hatred. They need their fix and 2-minutes-hate, so they turn on you since you are currently the weakest-looking thing. This isn't a "both sides are equally bad" argument, but you can see the same shit on /k/ (and other conservative leaning sites) when someone from a blue state moves there for lax gun laws, taxation, social, or whatever other reason. I call these perpetually aggrieved faggots "landmine people". They WANT to be offended, but the havoc they can wreak on your life far outweighs anything you could gain from "winning", so the smartest thing to do is to just avoid them. Basically do what the hood niggas do when there is a gang war. Just nope the fuck out of there.
<comment>
Landmine people lol. I gotta remember that one
<comment>
Spread it around. "IED" is probably more accurate, but you would reveal you "know too much" if you were to use it around the wrong person. "Landmine" is the perfect balance between plausible deniability and accuracy.

Yeah it's rough t. Alameda fag
SF and Berkeley are sort of like inverse Bible belt towns. 
Try San Mateo, Oakland, Pleasanton, Dublin, San Leandro, pretty much anywhere but fucking SF or Berkeley.
If you're in SF try going to Thee Parkside or The Connecticut Yankee. Both are in Potrero Hill.
In the East Bay, Port Costa has a real wild bar and is an awesome town. Further east, The Sunshine Saloon is a great place to drink and eat and meet people but it's in Pleasanton. 
California is diverse, you can drive thirty minutes in any direction and be Inna woods.

Only thing that bothers me is people that don't like being called dude. Don't live here if you're just gonna be a snowflake about the lingo
<comment>
From what I've expereinced the culture in East Bay and San Jose is cool. Haven't visited Oakland yet.
Fuck the Peninsula and SF though. This place sucks
<comment>
Yes the people in sf do suck. Only place where the first thing you will be asked by everyone is where you work, ie are you richer than me
<comment>
Oakland is fun but keep your head on if you're drinking there. I made the mistake of drinking too much and got rolled my first month living in the East Bay. Everywhere outside of Oakland is much more relaxed. If you're coming from a red state try Pleasanton and Dublin. They are about as red as it gets in the bay.
<comment>
Do people not get that the last thing I want to talk about when I'm away from work is... work? I hate it honestly. The money obsession here irks me.
<comment>
No? It's a yuppie hellhole, the mecca of big tech in the USA. What were you expecting?

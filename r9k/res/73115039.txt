Whats your reason for waking up everyday? 
I want to make my parents proud I think
I just don't want to burden my parents, so I keep a job and do that. Imagine a robot that all it does is work, no friends, no fun, nothing. I help my parents with expenses but I am so miserable in every other aspect of my life.
My kot
I dunno, maybe cause it would be troublesome to get my hands on a firearm
Cute but cats are garbage tier pets
im not quite so broken that i would rather rot and die than get out of bed.
Very cute cat anon

Whats your reason for waking up everyday?
Myself. I am so great. Behold my magnificence.
well at one point I wanted to see if Kentarou Miura would finish Berserk, another I wanted to see Steel Ball Run animated, other than that I just don't want to die
Moved out 3 years ago now. Work, come home and get so high I cant walk straight, repeat. Doesnt even feel good anymore just numb
i cant kill myself.
only reason.
I'm still paying my mama's mortgage
new games
new music
Idk if there is something that keeps me going other than FOMO
drugs I guess.
gonna kill myself if civilization doesn't collapse in the next decade or so
spite, hatred, cynicism, the plague that has devoured society as we stand in it together. i have lost my way and the only way to return is to destroy what is left.

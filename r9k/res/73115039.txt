Whats your reason for waking up everyday? 
I want to make my parents proud I think

I just don't want to burden my parents, so I keep a job and do that. Imagine a robot that all it does is work, no friends, no fun, nothing. I help my parents with expenses but I am so miserable in every other aspect of my life.

spite, hatred, cynicism, the plague that has devoured society as we stand in it together. i have lost my way and the only way to return is to destroy what is left.

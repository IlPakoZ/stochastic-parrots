If only I lost my virginity to a girl like this when I was in middle school
I'd be a real man like my father who met my mother when they were both 14
Why do you think you can understand me,let alone comfort me?
This has to be a coordinated psyop from discordfags trying to make /r9k/ more depressed than it already is

opening up to a hoe
not even once. 
told shit to female relatives after they begged me to open up about my problems. figured i'd give them something to see what happens, told them different things. told my sister about my depression, told my mom about my anxiety. like the next day a bunch of people i hadn't told shit to started talking to me about both those problems.
it didn't help by the way. people just asked me blunt questions, walked on eggshells and tried dragging me everywhere. 
made it clear to them that i would never open up about anything to them after that. if i move i wont even tell them where i live.

any cocteau twins fans here?
I doubt anyone actually enjoys that sort of music and just forces themselves to listen to it to feel like a "real goth" whatever that means. Stop caring about identify and just enjoy life.
i enjoy it and i'm a redneck
how many strawmen do you keep in your barn?
Yeah they're amazing. Pearly dew drops is my favorite track from them.
memeemememmemeee
The only song I like by them so far is Fifty-Fifty Clown. What other songs would you recommend someone who likes that one?
i love elizabeth fraser's insane vocal range
cherry coloured funk is easily top 3 cocteau twins songs ever
fotzepolitic is slept on
the outro/coda is fucking celestial
Cannot call myself a fan, but i've (re)discovered the music recently and i enjoy it, especially the earlier albums. Love the dreamy melodies and vague vocals

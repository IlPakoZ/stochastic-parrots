Wtf is happening? Is talking to girls getting harder and harder?
No one replies to me on interpals.
On Badoo I only have 1 like and it's a guy
Hellotalk and tandem are the same as interpals.
Do I literally have to start paying some girls just so I can have a conversation?
I legit have no problem with any race.
Eh, don't worry too much about it, especially if you're a pureblood. Just stay on the grind and be patient.
simple
be rich
thats all it takes for any girl to want you
chads? haha
no, that shit is a meme, especially when a girl figures out that "chad" cant do SHIT
I'm kinda getting worried because I'm 27yo and it's getting grim
Looks like it's getting easier. You don't even have to be funny or charming anymore.

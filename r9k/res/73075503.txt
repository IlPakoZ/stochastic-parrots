Wtf is happening? Is talking to girls getting harder and harder?
No one replies to me on interpals.
On Badoo I only have 1 like and it's a guy
Hellotalk and tandem are the same as interpals.
Do I literally have to start paying some girls just so I can have a conversation?
I legit have no problem with any race.

Eh, don't worry too much about it, especially if you're a pureblood. Just stay on the grind and be patient.

I'm kinda getting worried because I'm 27yo and it's getting grim

Looks like it's getting easier. You don't even have to be funny or charming anymore.

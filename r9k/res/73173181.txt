Im fat but it feels like im constantly getting permanently sick of each junk food one by one and eventually i won't want any of it and hopefully lose weight finally. Like burgers and fries and pizza and almost anything fast food plus a lot of other stuff im so done with. Someone gave me a burger and i was hungry and felt like I forced myself to eat it all where I used easily eat multiple of them, or eat a whole pizza but now I can only have a few slices and that's it.
As a former fat fuck, still am kind of but not that bad, this feeling is a trap. Don't get your hopes up because you will get cravings the moment you stop munching on the junk for while. You will have to brute force it or make it really hard to get your hands on food.
Same thing happened to me, except I did not get fat before I started getting tired of junk food.
Best way to limit the junk you eat is to eat more meat and saturated fat.

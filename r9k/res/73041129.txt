little teen girls like korean men never adult women. I realized that after they turn 20 its all about Jason Mommoa types. Every single girl grew up with, and who had a phase when she was heavily into 'feminine' clean shaven asian men, outgrew this infatuation by 21. My uncle bought my little cousins tickets for BTS before COVID, the thing got post-poned and in those two years their love for love for pale guys with floppy hair was gone. They're almost mid 20s now and each one of them dates that hiking bearded white guy who always wears cargo shorts. 
t. look like the guy in the pic, lots of girls found me 'fine' when I was 16, not a single gf since college

So what your saying is Korean men get Prime Stacy at 16-25.
Then you get used up roasties.
Fine by us.

What I'm trying to say is I missed my train, had a few really good looking girls chasing me in high school, a really hot arthoe referred to me as 'the cutest guy at our school' which gave the impression that I'll really slay it in college. But the closer to my 20s I got the less appeal I had. Women in college were already into men who could grow beards and had them, masculinity became important, thick necks, broad shoulders and beards is what was the ideal boyfriend look.

Sucks to suck I'm still borderline anorexic at 24 and have no issue attracting hot women either 19 or in their 30's.

thinking gookcels get any women at all

Lol okay Brad.
I think about 3 guys in the last 2 hours said "Im Asian" and proceeded to insult Korean guys. These larp attempts are hilarious.
So my girlfriend whos Latina/Italian is into Kpop and shes 25 and im 28 atm.
The average Kpop consumer age is anywhere from 16-25 depending on the poll/statistic you see. Pushing ur shit statistics isnt going to fool any Korean. We know the realities and we know how you operate.
We're Asian when you want it to fit into ur dating statistics and then we're "Koreans" when you want to bring up suicide statistics.
Wont change my mind.

Really getting tired of seeing this incredibly forced dreck about koreans, with the first 3 replies always being some kind of strawman against koreans and then a "witty" comeback.
Nobody cares, stop racebaiting on /r9k/
go the fuck to /pol/ loser.

I don't believe you. I'm similarly underweight and I've never had a single woman express even the slightest bit of attraction to me.

her eyes closed
his open
ITS OVER

Then talk to them, I've fucked coworkers, friends and women on tinder and okcupid this year

This isnt a korean btfo thread made by some jelly whitecel. I literally experienced womens change of attitude toward me inna matter of years. Women iver the age if 21 simoly dont like the korean softboi clean look.
<comment>
Can we kiss like that but we both have our eyes open
<comment>
omo. im a bearded ahjussi.
<comment>
young girls like pretty men
older women eventually settle down with all kinds of guys
Wow, this must mean that they prefer the latter!
<comment>
Yes. Thats cute. Now can we kiss or not
<comment>
i have a (not) Kacey gf tho. she didnt completely crush my dreams
<comment>
Not him but
have very masculine appearance
be very emotionally complex and sensitive
tall to women
don't want them to feel/be uncomfortabl
they treat me like I'm not worth interacting with
I love womenbin concept and I love watching the be women in movies and such 
But when it comes to interacting with them it makes me angry. The logical thing for me to do is form a misogynist opinion given my experiences with women

that hiking bearded white guy who always wears cargo shorts
Hi I'm that bearded white guy with cargo shorts
though I prefer either hiking zip trousers or chinos
in puberty I went straight from looking like a small child (not the just child face like kpop stars, literally all body child) to full beard and looking mid / late 20s
I stayed on this look for like the last 10years
now 25yo
never had girls interested in me
never had a gf
until 2y ago, that's when I started working and actually got the chance to meet and date mid 20s women
apparently I'm not even ugly (probably above avg) or antisocial
I just had people around me that neither appreciated my looks nor my hobbies
but suddenly, after getting out of university, looking like a hipster dad and going on hikes / bike tours on the weekend is kinda cool and I got way more attention
<comment>
more like
young women have different preferences than older women and taste changes
and this change happens in their early to mid 20s, so they still have plenty of choice

That's a Chinese. Not Korean.

but suddenly looking like a hipster dad and going on hikes is kinda cool and I got way more attention
All the girls I know who did have a kpop/twink phase in their life started appreciating men who look like 'hipster dad', I'm talking 90% of the women I knew while growing up. For me it's like a cruse, like REVERSE INCELDOM; I started off as a cute kid and I was experimenting kissing with girls since I was 6, as a teenager I was cold approached bygirls each year of high school, at 18 I had a girl who was stalking me, then I entered college and slowly fell off women's radar. In freshman year I never got approached, only rejected, and when some friend try play as my wingmen all the responsey they got from women was that "i wasn't their type", at 25 I am no ones type anymore, every girl my age has a bearded white guy as her bf or is looking for a bearded white guy for a bf.

women over 25 don't like men with narrow necks, I have a narrow neck. It didn't matter when I was a teenager, girls only cared about my smile and hair. But as an adult it makes you look weak, and not le protective bread winner type.
<comment>
You know you can literally do neck exercises for that right

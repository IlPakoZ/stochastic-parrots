I'm convinced that inceldom is mostly about missing the time frame / window when you can actually get to know single chicks your age.
If I was in high school, I'd get a gf.
So why didn't you have a gf when you were in high school?
For me, obviously I met a lot of girls back then but they were all repulsed by me so it didn't matter
Go online
Find a website with escorts

sex
?????
lose profit but get rid of your sexual needs for a month
I did, anon. I did.
All i want is to hug a woman next to me in bed
So go to a college anon. This isn't hard
Inceldom isn't bad if you have your own space and have the money and time to indulge in drugs and alcohol.
How do you magically restart your life at 35? 
It doesnt work.
All Boys High school and later puberty.
I can't because my job does drug tests and I can't risk switching jobs as I'm unskilled
There are people that are in their 30s in college, shoot your shot or wallow in your pit of despair.
Sadly there weren't any. There were a few middle aged female teachers that started looking very attractive after a while.

lifes an rpg and i fucked up my build
where did you put your skill points
thats a good song anon
autism
blasting that albums makes me feel so good but also makes me want to an hero
are you alright anon? is there something you would like to get off your chest
i am currently mutilating my body with a hammer and a scalpel
i would advice you against doing self harm, but i can't stop you. i would like to be there and try to help you, but such thing is not possible.
i just hope your heart finds solace one day, anon.
Yeah we all did. Right build is to max out CHA every time, that's always important for the MC so he can pass conversation checks.
Nah it's a rigged game , locked behind paywall dlc and hr cunts who should be shot indescrimiately with extreme prejudice. God should kill them all
Your parents fucked up your build by toxifying your body and feeding you indigestible trash devoid of nutrients. This was not your fault in the slightest
you can still maximize your outcome anon. it probably takes self reflection which is hard but its not over yet
the most based. why does no one ever talk about this
This anon gets it, I used to try to max INT so I could get a huge bank and a high status role in the guild, but CHA is where it's at. It's way more fun to max, and equally effective with women. 
I can just talk to women now and get them to like me, why the fuck would I work 60+ hour workweeks grinding my skill levels to 99 when I can just talk to women and skip the middleman?
I really can't empathize with your thread but I like your pic so have a bump.

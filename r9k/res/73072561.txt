<comment>
i am currently mutilating my body with a hammer and a scalpel
<comment>
i would advice you against doing self harm, but i can't stop you. i would like to be there and try to help you, but such thing is not possible.
i just hope your heart finds solace one day, anon.

Yeah we all did. Right build is to max out CHA every time, that's always important for the MC so he can pass conversation checks.

Nah it's a rigged game , locked behind paywall dlc and hr cunts who should be shot indescrimiately with extreme prejudice. God should kill them all

Your parents fucked up your build by toxifying your body and feeding you indigestible trash devoid of nutrients. This was not your fault in the slightest
<comment>
you can still maximize your outcome anon. it probably takes self reflection which is hard but its not over yet
<comment>
the most based. why does no one ever talk about this
<comment>
This anon gets it, I used to try to max INT so I could get a huge bank and a high status role in the guild, but CHA is where it's at. It's way more fun to max, and equally effective with women. 
I can just talk to women now and get them to like me, why the fuck would I work 60+ hour workweeks grinding my skill levels to 99 when I can just talk to women and skip the middleman?

I really can't empathize with your thread but I like your pic so have a bump.

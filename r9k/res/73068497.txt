Am I truecel? Should I give up on ever having sex or gf with xxy syndrome and autism?
this is the kind of body you have if you've never worked a day in your life
have wider hips than this guy
it's never been more over than it is right now
guy shaped like a razer deathadder
Built like a pocket pussy
Go to the gym for fuck sake
looks like me first day back at the gym after the covid lockdowns
built for transition, literally.
Nah, I know a guy with a similar build. But he is tall and cute and gets women attention.
Use your autism to research roids and just start pinning. It's literally the only way to get out of your physique and have a decent life. You might die young but better than dying old and doughy.

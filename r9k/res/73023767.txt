This is like a rick and morty segment lol
I didn't think it was actually a real thing

Their intended endgame is that all men stop going to work and goverment gives in and gives every incel his own personal 18 year old virgin sex slave.
But the real endgame is going to be inceldom becoming a mentall illness officially and all the no pussy no work people being locked in mental asylums.

He's finally gone full retard.

first of all, that site is BASED
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
second of all, they stole vegan memes, pic related. this is a VEGAN meme. they just steal memes. this meme is originally about how organic animals and conventional animals all end up in the slaughterhouse. i find it so ironic they talk about tyrannical society, use memes to show society's tyranny, but dont advocate veganism
compared to animals, you live in heaven
they also moralize. this implies they care about morals, and they talk about a tyranical society
i wonder if they advocate veganism as well? because it would be really hypocritical of them to criticize society for its tyranny when they are the victims, but smugly laugh and say "SIMPLE-AS", when they are not the victim
overall a hilarious website, but i cant take you seriously when you are a hypocrite, even tho its hard to disagree with your core message

Can I just hit the snooze button on veganism and worry about it again in another twenty years? Feel free to give your protein back to soil by killing yourself ASAP.

This isn't that smart of a way to advertise your shitty honeypot website
<comment>
This is got to be a glownigger honeypot

the endgame is to not work, if i don't get passionate pussy and love first. simple as. there is nothing more to it.
<comment>
I wouldn't work even if you gave me pussy on a platinum platter. 
But around mental health professionals, I do not mention never having had sex.
<comment>
All men who don't get pussy go on general strike until government does something.
In theory at least, in reality getting a group bigger than 3 men to do something together is impossible.

But really, I do wonder what will be the endgame of all of this.
There are way too many incels globally, it's just that many don't call themselves that YET. This number is also growing over the decades, especially in countries where arranged marriage is dying as we speak.
So will incels do some crazy shit this century, or do you think they will just occasionally ER and forever be irrelevant in the big picture of things?

holy fuck this website is comedy gold, the list of approved jobs is blank and the list of disapproved jobs is choc full of shit, 
every fucking job has "that's the definition of ultimate cuckoldry" in the description, holy shit that's too fucking good i love the CIA for coming up with this shit sometimes.
<comment>
yeah same, i chameleon while refusing to work. i just say im "in between jobs" or "the job search is extra hard nowadays you know"
<comment>
you cant just dismiss genuine moral criticism under the rug and expect to be taken seriously, anon
<comment>
Sure I can. I'm doing it right now. Ultimately all morality is subjective because humans are animals with no higher guiding purpose. I refuse to be better to animals than they would be to me.
<comment>
In my opinion the endgame should be the banning of hormonal birth control.
<comment>
Holy based. Same. Imagine wanting 3DPD roasties wew lad. It should just be called "No work".

This in the internet son. No one "owns" memes. It is free real estate

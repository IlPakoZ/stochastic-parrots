For the past three months I have been in an online relationship with a girl. We've been chatting for hours every day, talking on phone calls and we even saw each other naked on cam.
She's pretty nice and although her personality admittedly isn't my type (she's the quintessential normalfag), at least I know she is honest with how she feels and extremely understanding.
The problem is that, as a virgin incel, I am obsessed with the idea of a tradwife, so I made the mistake of asking about her sex life. Told me that she did it with a guy when she was 15 (he's 18), but regrets it a lot. I didn't ask who was him or how many times? This doesn't sound so bad but I kept digging and found out that she had done handjobs at least once and kissed ~30 guys. Also, from what she tells me and what I see on video call, most of her friends are dudes. Don't know if it's relevant but she likes those tacky erotic novels for young girls and has a small tattoo under her sideboob.
No idea how much of this is a red flag. I'm a virgin and haven't had a girlfriend since I was 12 but I have kissed once and touched boobs more than one time, so I don't know how much purity I can demand.
I'm getting attached to her and we have decided to meet in june, but I don't know how to orient my relationship. She says she loves me but I can't shake the feeling of jealousy. Although I like her a lot I can't say that I see her as the love of my life. To be honest, my main motivation to be with her is to feel that someone is attracted to me.
Should I take it seriously or just fuck around like a dirty normie?
P.D: She doesn't know about most of my hobbies, like anime, videogames and internet shitholes.

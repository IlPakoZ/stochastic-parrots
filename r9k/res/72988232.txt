Might be an unpopular opinion, but I believe indirect sex is way hotter than actual sex. Pic related is a good example. I wish I could have a girl stroke the shit out of me while I tray desperately not to blow as she teases me and eventually tells me to shoot it all out.

I prefer that too. Penetration seems to be overrated.

I once talked to a woman who said "sex is overrated it's everything leading up to sex that's nice," and I just felt "yeah, that's true."

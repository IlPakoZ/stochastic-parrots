I think I need to develop proper standards. From what I understand, being happy with literally anything isn't very respectable, and my current "preferences" are far too strange/stupid to be realistically tangible. So long as I don't get to the point of "Stacey only" or whatever, I think I'll be alright.
Where would I start with setting standards?

set standards on how much attention you give to others. does she deserve your attention? make it a limited commodity, in turn it will mean something when you give it away.

also 
never compliment women on their looks. if you find something else to compliment them on, let her friends know in passing. build jealousy among the group, use that to date the prettiest girl in the group.

smart girls = call them pretty 
pretty girls = call them smart 
never smile. in intervals, completely ignore what the woman is saying. talk about something else.

This kinda makes sense to me, I usually only message folk if I have something to say or in the rare cases that they messaged first.
This sounds manipulative, and I don't wanna be like that.

What about slow in the mind girls?
What about the ugly bitches?
What about transitioned man girls?
Your advice is too broad.

just gaslight them and convince them of traits they don't (do) have

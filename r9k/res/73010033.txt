Why does this board celebrate manwhores but when a femanon sluts out to chad it's the worst thing ever?
<comment>
Because most people here fail to realize their double standards, and most people fail to see past arbitrary gender stereotypes in general

It's not just this board youngling, but society in general and it's it not just men but women do it too. They love manwhores so much they'd rather be around them than male virgins
<comment>
It's a pretty obvious double standard and they hate sluts more than regular men, so I'd assume they'd think about it.
Yes NPCs outside of /r9k/ do it more, but this board especially should know better, at least somewhat.

do something difficult
receive praise
do something easy
get mad when the room rolls their eyes at you
also chads should be kneecapped just like you, hole

when something is harder that means it's good
Lol, no.
just like you
I'm not a woman, and I'm not a slut. I'm bisexual, so I could have sex with like 200 guys in a week if I wanted to, but I know that's meaningless and gross. I'm saving my virginity for someone I love.

i hate manwhores and whores equally so i dont know what youre trying to say 
my greatest achievement in life is probably converting my manwhore friend to dedicate himself to one girl that cares for him so in a way he can experience the feeling of being loved by a virgin which i could never experience myself 
dating and hookup culture is just a cycle of pain and i wish it would die out already

I don't mean it necessarily applies to you, but it's a common trend.
manwhore x virgin
Oh, no. I wouldn't consider that a good thing. Sluts deserve each other.

Sluts deserve each other.
i 100% agree with this but he is my friend and i wanted to help him out and also the girl has been lovestruck with him for years

Homos don't count faggot

it kind of hurts
why are virgin women so disgusted by virgin men 
ive literally rejected girls and bimbos and stacies to save myself for the right girl and want to experience love for the first time together with someone i care for that shares the same experience but girls seem to be disgusted by virginity and none want the same 
it feels like i fell for a meme

This thread (>>73008033 â†’) inspired my post. Lots of people are just saying he's based or whatever. If you go to "bodycount threads", women with a bodycount over 1 are berated but men with 20+ bodycounts are ignored. Manwhore stories are often celebrated, like a guy losing his virginity to some random slut.
Don't count towards what? Lol.
If you've been in the position to reject a stacy then you can definitely find a virgin girl lol.

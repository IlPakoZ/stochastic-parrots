Past a certain age, a man without a family, can be a bad thing.
What the fuck did they mean by this? And at what age?

It's because there's no time left to party. The median age is 30.

men without a family can't be controlled easily. they have no stake in the world. men are powerful and can do destructive things. lots of men with no stake in the world and destructive power can be a bad thing for society. imagine if everyone on /r9k/ went crazy.

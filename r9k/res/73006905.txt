is it possible to have been molested as a kid and not be able to remember it but still feel like you were bc touching your penis triggers lots of bad feelings? asking for a friend
yes, you often repress those memories too if they were too traumatic.
ty, that is reassuring
repressed memories is a bullshit freudian theory
You say it's not possible to repress a memory. I disagree. I've repressed lots of memories.
Sounds like something a gaslighting child molester would say
probably the one thing Freud got right.
you can reason it as forgetting the memory but kerping the trauma too.
kids often can't express it properly, and therapists often see it through draeing and the like instead.
yes anon this is common among victims seek help.

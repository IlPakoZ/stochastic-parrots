Get prescribed a bunch of medications by my doctor
They turn me asexual
This is the best i have ever felt in my life. My dick isn't reacting to anything and i feel completely tranquil and at peace. I can finally leave this place. See you later sex needing loser.

It's a good feeling. You can also get it by working really hard on something you're interested in. Women are a distraction

Congrats, you've been chemically castrated by big pharma. At least you seem to enjoy it.

Good goy, now work, buy your taxes and buy things. You don't need a family to be happy nor do you deserve one, just work and consume your pills until you die.

This, i also took antidepressants and lithium it turned me asexual and repulsed by porn and it was the best thing ever. I am only attracted to my GF now

If you're asexual how are you having a gf?

The point is im only attracted to my GF and we have sex at least once a week but i dont have any coomer mentality. No porn and shit, only my GF.

So just a reduced libido.
Maybe women should start partially castrating their bfs while they're asleep. Like just cutting off one testicle.

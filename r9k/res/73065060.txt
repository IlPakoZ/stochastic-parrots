i don't get any of it, but some people remind everyone to drink water constantly, and there are people who put down soda or literally anything other than water. 
people can be snobby about coffee, but i've never heard about energy drinks.

coffee and energy drinks will not make you obese. Beer won't neither because you cannot drink that much without becoming alcoholic

Beer will absolutely make you fat are you fr?

I am obese and drink 3 of these
guess which ones

But no normal person drinks enough beer daily for them to become obese. You cannot just go around being drunk all day, so you have to limit your consumption

What if the thing we really fear is the spike of emotional energy that comes from shock, which we then absorb as fear, shame and guilt.
What if we rationalize it by thinking about objective things that could go wrong: Getting expelled, losing job, rejected by others.
What if we then protect ourselves from this emotional spike by avoiding facing things that could trigger it: actually studying, working hard, talking to people
But what if this pattern of avoidance is the actual thing causing the objective things to go bad.
And all we have to do is realize that our fear of the emotional spike in energy is just that, a spike in emotional energy, nothing else, it cant hurt us
The fear of fear itself and the subsequent avoidance is what is causing the damage
the thing is I don't actually care enough about the benefits of the good to put myself through the bad, so why bother?
I just sincerely dislike most people; it's not that deep
That's fine. I avoid doing anything because I've seen people who don't avoid things. They have suffered all manner of humiliating, painful, objectively terrible things. Regardless of whether or not some things go right for them, why repeat their mistakes that led them to disaster? I will live the dormant life as much as I possibly can.

You're right it's a natural response to negative stimuli. Overtime, the avoidance breeds complacency which creates bitterness. One would start viewing the world from the perspective of a victim and believing there's no use in trying anything because no matter what they do their circumstances don't change. At this point it becomes a choice of staying stagnant or striving for better.
You can externalize your negative emotions, you know. You can hate other people; not yourself
good insight op. fear is the mind kille r
What's the use in hatred at all? negativity is all you'll reap and perpetuate.

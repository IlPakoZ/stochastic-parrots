Why cant femcels just fuck off to crystalcafe, you niggers have your own website to bitch on yet you come here daily to post shitty bait and antagonize incels. 
If you want to complain about chad pumping and dumping you how about you go complain to people who actually have interactions with women.

There is no such thing as a femcel.
Unoriginal but true.

Not true, I've helped many femanons

Thats not a femcel thats a transcel masturbating to people replying to his bait calling him a woman and she/her.
They arent allowed on crystal caffee.

I always wondered what exactly the comic means to say the man did. Just lose interest and leave her? How could that be avoided, compatibility is just luck. It's just as likely that she becomes the one to lose interest. Would she rather the man stayed with her in a fake, loveless relationship no matter what? Surely not.

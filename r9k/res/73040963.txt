have you ever creeped on a girl
<comment>
I am pure cringe but to such a degree you understand that no I've never creeped on a girl, I'm not racist or misogynist or homophobe or anything. I am perfect.

I stalked a cam girl for like a week or two. She was really hot and I didn't know what to say to her. Her streams were so boring. She'd maybe shake her ass a bit if someone tipped her. Otherwise she'd be having these boring ass conversations some guy is trying to make small talk with her and she'd be all like " i wanna go on a vacation with my boyfriend. " complete bimbo. Way hotter than any of the actual girls I was seeing at the time.

No, but I've been accused of it. I can understand why some guys are just like fuck it, might as well creep when I'm gonna get accused anyway.

What count as being a creep?
I have been pretty cringe and incel in the past but I don't think I was a creep.

Yes, when she asked me to ''check her out''
she got embarrased by how I was molesting her with my gaze.

Daily reminder that all men are the same and lesbian is the only way

I'm so happy my gf makes fun of me for being faggy and feminine
<comment>
are you somehow implying that as a man I wouldn't want this?
<comment>
"feminine" men don't exist, you're just denying your true nature for her validation
pic not related cuz men would do anything for pussy anyway

only virgins and betas would do anything for pussy. eventually you have enough sex that you don't really give a shit about it as much as you do about love and validation. why do you think chads always settle down with like 7/10s?

meh i'm too awkward to date anyone male or female i'd rather just stay in my room and masturbate

Daily reminder to grow the fuck up. People will never be what you want them to be. Stop being stupid and start loving people expecting nothing in return. One way or another you will be rewarded

Nah Ill stick to fictional men, just schlicked to one. 
I love women only platonically and I guess I just have to give up romance irl. Real men are boring and ugly.

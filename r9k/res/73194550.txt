You may not believe me, but I won the lottery. It's not a crazy amount, after taxes it came out to about $500k. But I won it when I was 22 and now I'm 24.
At first I didn't know what to do. I really hate working but it's not quite enough to retire on. Of course I quit my job anyway, fuck that.
My dating life has been unchanged, I can't exactly put my winner status on my profile. Still never managed to get laid (although I've seen a fuckton of hookers now).
Not sure what to do really. If I stay in America I'll have to suffer pretty much as I have been the last 24 years just with a small nest egg.
But I can probably retire in South East Asia right? And get a loving wife and family?
I can't talk to anyone about this, due to the taboos of talking about lookism and the amount of money I have would make my friends jealous
You should save some and invest some
people always say this on here in an attempt to look smart lol
I'll gay marry you for 30k anon
Nah but for real that's super cool anon. South east Asia like Thailand/Vietnam or you thinking like Malaysia? There are a number of rich white kids that like live off a laptop and spearfishing in Bali, I am sure you could do that with your money.
Yes and no. You have enough to retire, but wether you get a family or not is dictated by your looks, you won't be able to impress women with your rich lifestyle if you want to retire.
Sounds like a larp, I replied because this is my dream basically, having enough money go escape wage cuckery
if i had that money i'd drink it all away and kill myself.

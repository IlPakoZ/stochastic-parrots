I always wondered what the reaction was when a baby like this was born in medieval times. They must of thought it was a literal demon.

The meat of a young cow is very tender and melts in your mouth. I would guess that this thing have a really soft and delicious meat as well. I'm not into that, but the meat would go waste anyway, right?

Poor bastard. Damn. That sucks.

exactly, and it looks like it tastes very creamy, like a cake that melts in your mouth

They can live up to 25 years so the meat wont be very tender then.

I wouldn't be so down on abortion. A higher proportion of females and niggers are aborted every year so there are positive benefits to society.

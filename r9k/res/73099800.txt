Women will never experience true loneliness. I hate them so much its unreal.
Ok ok I am not a big fan of women but that picture doesn't do the situation justice. What would you do if you were surrounded by millions of 500lbs willing to be around you only having sex and they would probably ditch you after a hookup as if you were a mere conquest. Thats the life of a low tier woman. But I do agree that women have it better when it comes to intra gender relationships like friendships.
No it's not. A low tier woman can have a fulfilling relationship with a low tier or average man easily, provided that her personality isn't complete dogshit
Leave your basement for a change and you will notice it's not true.
But women are doomed to not find most men attractive. So its like your only option out of loneliness is being in relationship with some ugly landwhale or let's say another men. You are stuck.
yes men literally only want sex. 500lb men will only settle for stacy. you are not a concern trolling foid.
You are incredibly retarded and should kill yourself desu
False equivalency. Women have infinite suitors and plenty of them a perfectly normal, average, respectable guys. Globohomo feminism has psyoped women into degenerate mode of thinking that they all believe they're entitled to a 7 foot gazillionaire model.
You can't force attraction. Women find most men unattractive simple as.This have been proven multiple times. I dont know why is it so hard for you to understand that average guys illicits same response in them like some landwhale obese women would in you.
men have a lot more dominance in society. a "lonely" man is just a trans woman in reality.
the fucking numbers bro am I seeing this shit correctly

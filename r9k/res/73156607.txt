Tell me about the most interesting woman you've ever met. Blood relations don't count.

I once talked with a Korean nurse about anime when I was in a psych ward in 20181. I don't remember much at this point, but that was the last time I had a meaningful interaction with a female outside the family.

Very soft spoken girl with a ton of piercings who turned up to a community barber and got him to shave her head. Talked with her a little, she moved all over Europe doing as she pleased and never staying in the same place for more than a month. She had a lot of insights about people using drugs and alcohol and sex as a crutch to get to intimacy instead of just being up front and talking. I only met her twice before she hit the ground running again and left for Germany, but I still think about her. She made me a paper doll that I still have somewhere.

I find most people to be interesting once their guard is down and they become conversationally intimate

i had a dream where i was running far away from corruption. i was in a city, and ran from the police, who wanted to capture and put me back into the rat race, when i hid in a park. it was strewn about with junkies, but this girl was also at the park with her partner, and you could tell she was fiercly independent, while the guy supported her like a cute dog. i was scared and didn't know what to do, or why i was even there escaping in the first place. in my dream, i sat with them, and asked the girl to sing for me because i was scared. she sang me a soft and sweet song, and i closed my eyes to listen. they took me along with them, and we ran far away from that city and corruption. in the final bits of the dream, we were watching the stars, and i was thinking about how everything that had taken place that day.
i don't particularly care for women. a lot seem shallow and have no depth. a lot seem to have lost what makes them human, but this interaction in my dream stood out to me. it felt pure with no strings attached. i can't say it was a romantic love, but i felt connected, comforted, and accepted. i guess it was a dream, and all of that comes ultimately from myself, but i'd like to think that the conscious experience never ends once you fall asleep. you just experience reality differently.

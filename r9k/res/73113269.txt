I started balding heavily at 18 and have cutis verticis gyrata (pic related). I am now 24. I have spent my whole youth deeply ashamed of my appearance, largely stayed indoors whenever possible, and have worn a hat every time I've been outside for years. I am a virgin, have no friends, and have become incredibly withdrawn through the years of isolation. I am rapidly entering into being middle aged, my ability to date women younger than me is becoming less likely by the day, and even if I manage to find some 26 year old chubby girl I'm barley attracted to fuck me she will have 16 bodies before me and I will be left emasculated and humiliated. I have nothing left to live for.

I just don't get how you can be super ugly and still think you deserve a younger, more attractive women. Suck it up and start fucking middle-aged fat chicks you picky kike.

Stay inside. Your presence will be traumatic for women.

I don't think anyone really "deserves" anything. I certainly don't think I deserve anything, thats why I keep indoors. I'm literally a genetic failure. But even the most cursed and busted of us all have desires. Cute 19 year old alt girls look just as hot to me as they do anyone else. It just sucks that I can't even get close to that. Like my options are to either kill myself, rot away the rest of my life, or put myself out there and be hardcapped at an existence I'm not even fond of. It's hard to tell what the best option is

A lot of normal people on here today so few can understand I guess, don't worry about it. Also understandably most genetic deformities are funny if they aren't happening to you.
I'm about your age and started balding rapidly halfway through my teens, and I've wasted my entire youth isolated, so I heavily relate to what you wrote, though balding is just one of many issues that made me undesirable and only worth mocking to others.
Personally I'm not interested in dating women substantially younger than me, but it fills me with suicidal despair that I never got to experience the normal window of early romantic and sexual validation, and young love that develops naturally in high school or college, and that the odds of finding a woman that has the same zero amount of romantic experience that I have is impossibly slight, to say nothing of the odds of me being compatible with her and also physically attracted to her on top of that.
even if I manage to find some 26 year old chubby girl I'm barley attracted to fuck me she will have 16 bodies before me and I will be left emasculated and humiliated
I don't see people talk about this specific aspect very often. Even if I did finally get a girlfriend, realistically she would have previous romantic experiences, and I feel like I would always feel resentful and hurt inside if she had received romantic and sexual validation through her life and had no understanding of the kind of loneliness I've spent my entire life in.

Forgot to say I've been on it since I was 19. I'm still balding. It's probably slowing it down, but not enough when I have NW7 genetics

Why not grow it out enough so that it hides the crinkles? surely you could have a medium length cut and balance it out with a beard and it'd look fine?
<comment>
you people make me fucking laugh sometimes
<comment>
Damn dude, I wish there were something you could do about it. It might be difficult, but have you ever tried going out without the hat, and just fuckin owning it? Make a game out of telling people ridiculous reasons for it. 
Just tell people outrageous shit. Thats a kind of confidence not many people have.

Owning this kinda hairstyle makes me feel ancient. It's even worse to feel insanely old and ugly than just ugly.
<comment>
At least you have psychic powers, OP.

Not shaving it, and getting swole and not giving a fuck

I don't get it, it's probably not that bad if you don't force your skin up, could be solved by letting your hair grow and it probably doesn't even matter or it's noticeable that much for most people, even if it mattered, just wear a cool hat. I don't understand the problem with your head. But if you are talking about getting a virgin at your age, it's possible by growing your social skills, or joining a church. But it's better to just accept that the female had sex before. You are probably not a Chad, so just accept that you won't get the prime, honestly, besides your biases, it doesn't even matter that much most of the time whether the girl had sex before, and you can get used to the feeling, once you are horny, any hooker will look like a damsel. I honestly get you, but stop giving excuses for being lazy.

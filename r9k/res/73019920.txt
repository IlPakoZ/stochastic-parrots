I've been on a quest this year to make at least 1 single friend, I have not succeeded so far
I'm very lonely and am probably going to kill myself if I fail again this month
does anyone have any advice or tips
no advice because i also don't have any friends OP. But how exactly have you tried?
Maybe post your interests/hobbies/etc here in case your friend is browsing?
How have you been going about it, anon?
Making friends as an adult is hard, I can relate.
If youre 25+ dont be too hard on yourself
So you think I should just roll over and be alone for the next 60 years
nice advice thank you, you're very kind
i was wondering anon, what do you think you are doing wrong?
have you always been friendless?

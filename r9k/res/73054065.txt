Why don't you just choose to be more optimistic? Life is nice if you try.
Because nothing good ever happens
I tried it and it made things worse
because you'd be lying to yourself, which would only make you feel worse.
Are you developing situations in which good things are more likely to happen? Building a career, pursuing education, attempting to be a bit more outgoing, trying new things, etc.?
The secret is to keep trying.
Having a more positive mental attitude isn't lying to yourself.
coPINGAS usual I see?
ok try getting hit by a truck and choose to be more optimistic then
I didn't know self-help gurus visited this site
Trash hypothetical. You aren't being hit by a truck and likely never will be.

Yes and none of it really feels good, man.
Unfortunate. Use drugs and keep trying.
No, I'm avoiding drugs and alcohol but I will keep trying.
Not true. I spent the last 15+ years in a shit sandwich situation and contemplating manually shuffling the mortal coil. I found someone who was in an even more shit situation than I was, and I helped them to get out of that situation and move to somewhere better. I've kept in contact with them and they've consistently made me the happiest I've been since I was a child. I'm currently making preparations to move to be with them.
Don't say that good things never happen; I'm living proof that shit can get better.

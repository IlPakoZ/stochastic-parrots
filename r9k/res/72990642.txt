I've spent too much time following /pol/ and twitter gimmick accounts that spend all their time posting vids of blacks fighting, looting, being reverse racist, proving the stereotypes and what have you.
deep down I know this is all cherrypicked hyper focused content that is just made for me to get mad and be racist 
I dont want to be a basement dweller who quotes FBI crime statistics
Are there any fellow bots who have successfully made it out of the basement and can offer some advice on how to get out of this racist spiral im in
Not just that but general Transphobia and bigotry too 
There has to exist some fine line between aloof redditor and complete degenerate

Pick and choose what you look at try to keep it happy you'll slip sometimes but hopefully you've cultivated a healthy mindset by then

Try leaving America because most of the Africans I met are quite civilised.

It's all a fake show to send you into the radical action to federal prison pipeline. The far right is run by feds, the far left is run by feds. It's like 1984s big brother but even more elaborate. Anyone who is a threat to the system is tagged and bagged while the plant leaders carry on operations. The drug trade works the same way.
The radical groups ensnare you with hidden truth and then use you as a patsy for their whims and you gladly sign up thinking it will give you meaning.
It's all false you can only create your own meaning and live it, or be used and discarded by someone else's meaning.
You just think about something you can achieve that would be meaningful for you. You're a free man, not some food soldier for an agenda.

Sort of answered your own question. Get out of the basement literally. Turn the internet off. Stop consuming carefully marketed hate directed toward your demographic.
Actually talk to real people. Go for a long walk in your town and count all of the black criminals, trans groomers, and scheming Jews you come across. If the number is more than 0 then go back to /pol/ and ask them for help. If it's 0 then realize your life is wholly unaffected by people you'll never meet who may or may not be doing bad things. Things you see in a .mp4 may have indeed happened, but basing your life around that is like watching footage of a bridge collapse and then never driving across a bridge again. It's stupid.

This is probably a troll, but fishy hungry bait look yummy.

That already makes you better than most.

Then take it further and look up other statistics concerning poverty and broken homes and stuff like that. It's a cycle of crime and poverty with many cultural and socioeconomic factors, not some simple race essentialism.

Also, there are a trillion leftist channels on Youtube, balance out your intake a bit. Some of them are worse than others, but whatever.

Touch some grass and meet people from those groups, befriend them if possible. You'll quickly realize they are fucking human beings.

There's nothing you can do, just live with the brainworms. I haven't visited /pol/ in years but still have internal rants about the Jews in my head whenever I'm not focused on anything in particular.

what??? dude this is beyond insane holy shit. I hope you're just joking.

Go to church. Volunteer with the homeless. Be a good person. 
This shit is addictive - rage addiction, addiction to feeling slightly better than people, etc. And what does it leave you? A loser. It's not just pol - get off all this shit - reddit, whatever - politics are outside of your control as is social shit. Don't think about them except rare occasions.

Not kidding. I don't believe it or even particularly dislike Jews, but the script will just run if my mind is idle. Like stuff like about how the kikes are committing white genocide, they hate us, they run the world and teach the kids to be troons, they enslave us and brainwash out women, they're the most privileged people on planet earth and hide behind muh holohoax... and on and on. What browsing a shithole does to your brain. I'm self aware about the psyop but this is happening to people everywhere on here or on Twitter and it's happening to kids with ipads that their parents set them down with.

Just stop consooming media you retard

unironically just try to appreciate the little things. try to find something in people that you like.
the racism and transphobia will never go away because most black peepo and trannies that you meet are shitty to be around, but at the very least learn to empathize with them, realize it was a shitty childhood that made them this way and not anything biological, and that deep down they are human. 
if you can't find anything positive in humanity (which is okay, not everyone does), then turn to nature. sit by a beach or watch some birds or plant something. buy some animals, raise some bees, etc etc.
set some goals for yourself, or perhaps find a group to set a goal with. start a business with someone. join a band/choir/orchestra or sports team or esports team (last resort because high chance they'll be like you or someone you really hate, both are bad for you) and participate in a competition. it feels nice to win things as a group.
read some history. if you're american realize that, no matter how shitty our country is and how far our democracy has collapsed, the idea that our country has made autonomy and freedom the global norm will forever be a fact. we successfully defended it twice and we need to get our shit together before it gets threatened again, but getting mad and scapegoating religious or ethnic groups is only going to perpetuate the issue. it's a class issue and nothing more, nothing less.
find your passions anon and let some love into your life- it will eventually replace the hate but leave the logic behind, like a storm weathering a stone. good luck

Wear your anime shirt, anon. Don't let them shame you for who you are.
what a fucking chad. holy shit. &amp;picture related
How are you too embarrassed to wear a shirt but not too embarrassed to go to a con? Do you go with friends?
Dude, seriously, i still can't believe this happened. I was really expecting to just get laughed at and coming back home feeling like a loser.
It's just a berserk shirt, why were you afraid ? I wear some card captor sakura,mecha from the 80's and tenchi muyo shirt everyday
I didn't call any of my friends because they are the reason i'm embarrassed of being into anime. I went on my own.
Well, i'm used to being around the kind of people who think anime is for losers. So that's why.
I am monitoring this thread
thought you faggots changed tactics last week since it wasn't working any more?
I'm pulling up to my friend's wedding rehearsal in a few months wearing an anime girl shirt. I hope one of the bridesmaids is a weeb.
To be fair its a very gay berserk shirt
really? i'm from europe and normie zoomer started wearing anime merch without even watching anime. inditex started fucking having naruto, evangelion... merch. wtf i thought this was a worldwide thing because of trap music.
Yeah. My cousin saw it once and thought it was two guys hugging...
Not at all. I live in Brazil, and though anime is pretty popular here, everyone in my social circle still have a bad notion of it. I guess i'm just unlucky

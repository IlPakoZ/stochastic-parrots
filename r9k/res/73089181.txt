Everyday i wake up and post endlessly on 4chan yet i get no (you)s. Like it's not enough i never had validation in real life, now the only community i sympathize with refuses to recognize me aswell. i've had people say how i write is giving them an ick impression of me on other forums, and it made me very self conscious about the words i use to write posts, but i honestly cannot see any difference and even if i could it's pointless to force myself to do something i don't like. i thought huh, maybe it's typos and grammar, feel threads, reddit spacing or not being female or using bait that makes my post uncomfortable but honestly most posters don't care about these and still get (you)s.
i might just be the first person too autistic to use 4chan.
Thx for (Not) reading my blog.

I would say it's the lack of grammar that contributes somewhat. You type like you're underage or have BPD, but that's just from my personal experience.

Foxes are known for poor grammar.

I'd figure magical foxes would be better at it, considering they're supposed to be tricksters and deceivers.

They are. They use childlike grammar to try to charm you and play dumb. OP is actually a bit suspicious.
See.
It is already working.
Begone! Bring in the SAGE!

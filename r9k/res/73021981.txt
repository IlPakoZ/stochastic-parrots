where do false expectations come from?
estimated Native American 27%
estimated Trans 21%
estimate vets 40%
Americans aren't the best with math.
Constant propaganda. It's fucking everywhere, especially this shithole
The result areso stupid I struggle to take them seriously, people must have trolled the questionnaire, nobody thinks over 20% of people are trans, muslims, or vets
libtards and women that's all you need to know
Live in New York City- 30%
How are Americans so utterly retarded? Is it a disease?
For Atheists, only 3% self identify as an Atheists. However, 17% of Americans don't believe in any god.
Wtf does that graph represent
Wait is this surprising which how much degenerate schizoids hyperfocus on trannies here?
It comes from people just not taking the poll seriously. No one legitimately thinks that 27% of the population is Native American. People must be confused.
Americans think 40% of the population was in the military? Do they think we are fucking Sparta or something?

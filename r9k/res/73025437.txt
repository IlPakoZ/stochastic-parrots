I don't have to jestermaxx anymore. I don't have to avoid eating my favorite food. I don't have to get a job nor certificates. I don't have to move out of my parents' place. Ever since I realized I'm an incel and there was no way to begin life with my shitty genes, I've opted out of the game voluntarily. I'll just off myself when my boomer parents die and I have no one else to support me.

Ive come to the conclusion that staying home, not getting a job and becoming isolated is okay as long as you enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it then you should stop torturing yourself and do said things, however if you enjoy it, do what you want
I accept it but I'm just going to do the best I can rather than pass a final sentence on all of my existence

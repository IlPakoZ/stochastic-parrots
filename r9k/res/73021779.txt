Don't be autistic about it. As long as it's whey protein, no onions, it's good.
You should try the Apollo brand protein shakes by Unico. They are unironically good as fuck, and don't have a lot of bad shit in them for you. They are low in carbs as well for people that care about that. Best tasting protein powder I've ever tried. They have a sample pack on their site for $25 that has all their best flavors. I really like the strawberry cheesecake one cause it actually taste like cheesecake. The salted caramel one is another of my favorites. I'm pretty sure they also sell on amazon too. They also sell some pre-workouts and other shit but I've never tried that stuff.

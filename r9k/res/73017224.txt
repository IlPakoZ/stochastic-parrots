Wow I check off almost all the oppressor boxes according to modern American politics.
I'm a straight, white anglo-saxon, Christian, cis-gendered male. The only victim box I can check off is that I'm Catholic instead of Protestant making me non-WASP. 
What about you guys? Which boxes do you check off in either category?

You should listen to Derek and buy a bathmate and vacuum hanger instead of coping with trash "studies"
A new study reveals that in white men, 5.5 inches is NOT average. The average for white men is actually 6.6 inches:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33748967/
Very large sample size of nearly 5000 men. All Caucasian.
Average length came at ~6.6 inches and average girth came at ~4.75 inches. The length was BPEL by the way (they said that they instructed the men to depress the pubic fat in the study)
The length of 5 inches you see in other studies comes up because men from other dicklet races are included.
So in short, if your penis size is below 6.6 inches, you are a dicklet by white European standards.

I'm close to 8 inches and I haven't gotten laid since 2015

I've used a bath mate for around 5 months and went from 7 to 7 1/2 erect. Flaccid is a lot longer

Wtf does the EL in "BPEL" stand for? 
It's about the worry that if I ever somehow happen to get laid, she'll like it.

Each patient was given details on how to measure their penis
Self reported measures are fucking worthless for anything.

A total of 4,685 men living in Italy
flaccid penis length was 9.47 (2.69), mean (SD) flaccid penis circumference was 9.59 (3.08), mean (SD) erect penis length was 16.78 (2.55) and mean (SD) erect penis circumference was 12.03 (3.82).
Italian
no mention what so ever of the ethnicity of the people tested, only that they were in Italy at the time. 
somehow conflates this to being themean for ALL of Europeans.
data was collected from young man who visited a urologist office.

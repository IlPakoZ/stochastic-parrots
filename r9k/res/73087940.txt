Post your recent steam activity and guess what each other are like based on it. Here are mine.
<comment>
You have 1k mmr in dota and like to play with legos
<comment>
I have no steam activity because I'm not a manchild and I spend the time you spend playing with toys working out and learning languages.
<comment>
Yeah alright. I'll give you a cookie if you get it right
<comment>
You're a pseud wannabe normie which is even worse
<comment>
Masturbating and watching subtitle anime doesn't constitute working out and learning languages anon.
<comment>
This is meant for this faggot >>73088140

Thank you for assuming I'm a native English speaker, I'll take it as a compliment.

vgh... lt's so fucking over
<comment>
You play a lot of VR. You use it in place of socializing in person because going out give you anxiety and you can be whatever version of yourself you want in VR. Also are a NEET based on those hours.
7.5k hours, 1k mmr. How?
You have very few hours and those are all multiplayer, you probably just hop on occasionally to play with old friends you used to speak to more frequently before you got busy with life. 
Autistic
<comment>
rarely play anymore
eh... who cares
<comment>
If I were to also assume you've got your head up your own ass, would you take that as a compliment too Rajeesh?
<comment>
You have a very tight and juicy bussy

<comment>
In my country my ethnicity is the normal one, you would be the rajeesh here.
<comment>
Another tight and juicy bussy
<comment>
Oh wait i'm a retard. I forgot what my thread was about and thought you were describing yourself. I only ever played norms to be honest. I used to be a lego kid though.
<comment>
You are a failed normie. Probably 5/10 in all aspects.
<comment>
videogames are for children. people need to start shaming gamers to the point of suicide again
<comment>
lmao sure nice fan fiction Rajeesh
<comment>
i pretty much just play apex and master duel
<comment>
is there much of a difference between playing videogames and 4chan?
<comment>
Bait. Stop replying to these retards
You seem pretty casual and you probably grew up with yu gi oh. You probably have a decent social life and leave your house and video games are just a casual hobby.
<comment>
How the fuck do you almost have all the ER achievements with only 111 hours? Did you use a guide or look up builds or something and just cheese through the entire game?
<comment>
I literally just played the game normally.
after beating the elden beast I looked up locations for the like 3 bosses I missed and the locations of legendary items. 
Elden Ring cheevos are extremely easy though compared to say getting all of them in DS3 which was a nightmare

This is true, but Primitive Technology has not dropped in quality one bit
<comment>
You play the nurse and face camp in DBD to piss people off. 
You think you are hilarious even though no one ever laughs at your jokes. 
You have yellow fever
<comment>
this version is slightly inferior 
i probably have more hours on openrct2

You have autism and know what B&amp;M stands for.

you have yellow fever
I occasionally enjoy JAV but I definitely don't have yellow fever. I like tan med girls most.
<comment>
You try hard in casual games. You yell at your friends if they make an incorrect call outs even though your silver elite. You also only pick meta killers in DBD.
<comment>
im more of an arrow guy
<comment>
I can't wrap my head around dbd, seems too one-dimensional. Fun for casual sure but how tf is high mmr tryharding a thing?
<comment>
i dont only play games on steam though

you don't like women
I know a dude who can speak multiple languages, is well read, works out, has a good job and plays video games all the time. You're just afraid of what other people will think because you're a faggot.
you used to be an optimist
You're introverted (as opposed to being a failed extrovert)
probably a chill guy
you sometimes go days without bathing
<comment>
You hate when sometime you like gets popular
You smoke weed

Originally the only reason you play CS GO is to play it with your friends. You recently got hooked so you started to play it more. 
You really do like completing your games.
Also you most likely play different games outside of steam, like MMOs or Riot games.
<comment>
You were that one kid in school who was super fascinated with world war II
<comment>
Originally the only reason you play CS GO is to play it with your friends. You recently got hooked so you started to play it more.
I had only 1 friend to play cs go with and he blocked from everywhere a year and a half ago. Since then I haven't had a friend and play for hours cs go alone.
You really do like completing your games.
You got it. I buy games only to get 100% on them. I'm not stopping until all achievements are complete!
Also you most likely play different games outside of steam, like MMOs or Riot games.
Only osu and fall guys. I don't play MMOs
<comment>
Awful at guessing but ye
<comment>
you should really give it a try again, its a lot better with anons from r9k, just keep an eye out for the vrchat thread that pops up on saturdays
<comment>
Here's mine. Mostly play OSRS these days so most of my vidya time isn't on Steam. Otherwise usually a sim-racing fag with my VR headset. Still get some L4D2 in occasion.
<comment>
I thought /r9k/ would have less normie tastes. Disappointed.
<comment>
You play the nurse and face camp in DBD to piss people off.
very close i play wesker and tunnel
You're introverted (as opposed to being a failed extrovert)
pretty accurate i just get sick of people a lot

You have several meme folders

<comment>
I've been mostly playing my old Gamecube games lately, so not a lot of steam history. I can't stand nu-CoD. I come back after not playing since MW3 and find a bunch of retards that buy skins, shitty maps, gay-ass slide canceling, and I have no friends anymore. Not sure how much longer I'll play. the nostalgia is barely there at this point.

Can't make out anything. I don't like Dota2.
You've got a lot of time on your hands. 100% a NEET.
GMod Chad. You no longer find the time to play vidya.
Good taste, unfortunately I'm too retarded for HOI.
Plays niece games. Or at least I consider them that because I've never heard of them except for Little Witch Nobeta (because of cunny).
The reason why GTA VI didn't come out yet.
Do the last achievement on the last game.
No clue. A friend of mine used to be obsessed with Dead by Daylight.
I don't know what the hell that Crab game is but your autism made you get 52 achievements.
Likes fighter games. Tekken is superior.
Only has one game and is obsessed with it.
Probably still bad at CsGo. Obsessed with Dead by Daylight.
Looked up Earth Defense Force 5, looks like Adhd.
Loves Mordhau. I recently played it and even though I was good at it the skill gap between veterans and new players was too huge so I uninstalled.
Barely plays anything. Tests and abandons.
I don't know. Apparently likes shooters.
No life CsGo.
Clueless.
Autism.
Average raging slav on CsGo. Might be a fag coomer (VR chat).
Good taste.
Autism+No life csgo.
How the hell do you have 1,6k hours on HOI but no achievements?
/o/bsessed with cars, perhaps?
/r9k/ is normieville now. You love Knockout City, achievements show.

Why'd you use an steam archievement unlocker for CS GO?
<comment>
I didn't, got most of them legit, the possible ones at least. Also used handy workshop maps or older versions of maps from the workshop
<comment>
Yes I'm a forever alone virgin and play Fap Goddess for the gameplay, not the hentai aspect.

What's your rank after the frontiers update
<comment>
I've been enjoying, would like to hear some thoughts though
<comment>
Do people still play the old MW2? Or is it like 200 people that will shoot me through walls because they know the spawns so well?
<comment>
Not even close.
Accurate AF on both accounts
<comment>
If people shoot you through walls they're probably just walling. People suck at the game and are just mindless idiots. Very rarely you'll run into a good player. But yeah, almost no one plays it anymore and all the hosts are in like Russia or something. You'd have a better time on that one modded version with dedi servers but I can't think of the name of it. But it's pretty solid. If you want a fun nostalgia night of MW2 I would definitely suggest finding it. It's called IW4x I think? But there was also some other name for it
<comment>
I like my paradox games.
<comment>
I got one of paradox games when it was free and the amount of clickable buttons and menu shit is just too fucking much for me.
<comment>
my autistic brain loves it, seeing those numbers go up makes me coom.
<comment>
I need something I'm actually interested in to go full autistic. Last year it was Baseball Spreadsheet Simulator 23.
<comment>
I only play on game and that is hunt showdown 1.5k hours
<comment>
I love all three of those games, but Stellaris got stale. New EU4 DLC looks fun, and HOI4 is still somehow feeling fresh, though that's probably just my mods.
<comment>
Yeah i can see how stellaris can get old. EU4 though never gets old i find, it also has so many full conversion mods its fucking amazing the best of which is Anbennar.
<comment>
To be honest EU4 never got stale for me, despite putting hundreds of hours into it. I've tried modded, but it just feels too wrong. Not for HOI4 or Stellaris though.
I feel as if hoi4 gets stale really fast because of how rigid it normally plays out. Sure, you can turn off historical AI, but then it often becomes too easy. Countries often fail to form alliances and become easily dividable.

Is there even 1 (one) single Paradox grand strategy game which has a GOOD tutorial?
I would like to click the buttons and make the numbers go up... but I need guidance.
<comment>
No, there are no good tutorials, we all had to go through the fire to be able to play them, just like you will have to, if you want a shot at enjoying them.
It's fine to give up, eu3 was my first pdx game and I gave up trying to play it 3 times, months passning by every time, the 4th time it clicked and now I've lost more than 10k hours in the different titles.
<comment>
nah not really. Its one of those games where you need to just play for hours upon hours before you even start to understand it. Also watch youtube videos if you really want help, but i warn you the simple youtube tutorials are like 40 mins long. I would also start with CK3 as thats the newer one with an easier start for newer people i guess.
<comment>
he doesnt know how to play runelite through steam
retard
<comment>
how do you have that many hours and no achievements?
<comment>
Thank you for giving me your best answers. I guess it can't be helped.
<comment>
one simple answer, mods. I also modify the game too much for achievements to be enabled. I dont really care about achievements at all.
<comment>
Been trying to cut down on games recently to make morw time for financial growth. Only log into CS:GO to check my investments and invest in more skins/stickers.

How the hell do you have 1,6k hours on HOI but no achievements
I used to play it while folding clothes in university or would play on 1 speed after a long day of classes because my schedule was class from 8-9am to around 8pm and then all the homework and projects and shit drained me. 
Also modded singleplayer and never used ironman

10k+ minecraft before 1.9 ruined it (dead game)

Lifting weights isn't productive either lmfao fuck off. If you aren't doing something to make you money then you aren't being productive (and this is fine).

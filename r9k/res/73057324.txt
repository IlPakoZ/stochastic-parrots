guys what do when your life is literally creep by radiohead
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
this used to be my comfort song now its more like a life story
christ i dont belong anywhere it seems, maybe i should wait along for the next life
what are the main reasons you feel this way, anon? i'm the exact same but it's because i'm ugly as sin
yep. ugly and autistic and balding. barely have friends, every girl i tried to talk to ghosted/blocked me.
im a real creep and i dont know how to change it
sorry if its a bit late, mine differ from yours though
socially inept due to years of shutting away as a teenager
average looking
average looking isn't good enough anymore
desolate areas make it harder to fit in, especially in already formed friend groups
i felt like an extra, a complete fucking leftover
i could go on but thats just a few
every girl i tried to talk to ghosted me
same dude, same, and the scary thing is im the one starting all the conversations, doing everything to keep our dms basically alive, it sucks

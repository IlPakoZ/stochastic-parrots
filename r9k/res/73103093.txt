 Be me
 Around 10 years ago
 Fell asleep
 Dreamt about my brother and I running away from some tractor (like in pic rel)
 It was like a game
 We were running from the tractor
 I looked back and my brother was gone
 I eventually completed the game, but at what cost
 my brother is gone
 I miss my brother
 Wake up
 Get in a fight with my brother
So anons, what was the dream trying to tell me?

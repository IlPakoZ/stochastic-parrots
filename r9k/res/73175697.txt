Currently between tier 1 and 2, haven't been here for long, no girlfriend, i spent most of my life alienated but i try to not let it get to me. Suicidal thoughts day to day just trying to find a purpose.

4, given that I'm a NEET of 11 years and haven't had sex in all that time either. Spongebob is pretty soothing sometimes, can't lie.

Tier 3, if this keeps up for another decade I'll be at tier 5.

tier 3, I started doing coke and painkillers probably end up shooting heroin or smoking crack

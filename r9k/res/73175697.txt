Where is /r9k/on the brutality scale? If you have a girlfriend or boyfriend you are tier 0 and need to leave this board immediately.
Tier 0 here
Tier 4
Tier 6 of course. This is the end of the rope over the abyss.
Teetering on 3. I am giving myself till 30 before I get the exit mask. I visited my friends grave who also roped and I wanted to join them but I didnt have my gun. I always feel Im one bad off the deep end
Tier 3 copes but with tier 1 mentality.
I'm on tier 4 but I am still using copes from the previous tiers.
Tier 3
4 I guess, but I'm not mentally ill.
Currently between tier 1 and 2, haven't been here for long, no girlfriend, i spent most of my life alienated but i try to not let it get to me. Suicidal thoughts day to day just trying to find a purpose.
4, given that I'm a NEET of 11 years and haven't had sex in all that time either. Spongebob is pretty soothing sometimes, can't lie.
Tier 3, if this keeps up for another decade I'll be at tier 5.
tier 3, I started doing coke and painkillers probably end up shooting heroin or smoking crack

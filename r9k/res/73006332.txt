how do i make it in life
is getting a degree
4chan and vidya all day
some anons have no hope bc they dont know what they can do with their lifes but you? why the fuck arent you spending the entire day in the library reading at least 100 pages daily. at the very least. a degree in philosophy means nothing without knowing the authors first hand. you have the oportunity how the fuck you dare asking how to make it life? pursue excellence where you are at motherfucker appreciate what you have
I have an English degree, so I say this with all sincerity, I literally have no fucking idea what kind of career you'd enter with a Philosophy degree
ending a post in "XD" as an adult

Professor is the only one I can see, but this is a shitposter asking how to make it in life, I highly doubt they have the fortitude to get a Ph.D. I love literature and writing and read like 50-100 pages of books every single day and I didn't even have the fortitude to go for my master's.
Hmm you are right. I'll consider this...
hope it's not your undergrad, i can't imagine taking all of those classes with 18 year olds
yes and it is quite painful, hellish almost.

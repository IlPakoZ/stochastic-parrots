gottastop.mp4
but can't
new girl starts to feel awkward around me because i just can't fucking stop spilling spaghetti
I know obvious answer is to simply transfer/avoid her and I'm working on it. The real problem is I thought I'm over this shit but apparently I haven't. I can't fucking stop myself and it's fucking scary. If this happens again I don't know what I'm gonna do. Sorry for the convoluted post but pls send help.
Is she really being awkward around you, or is it all in your head? Has she told you specifically. What does spilling spaghetti even mean in this context. Sounds like you could be just crushing hard and developing worst case scenarios in your head. Need more info.
She's nice enough to not outright tell me to fuck off, but she definitely keeps her distance. Like bringing in extra people, stand away from me in the elevator etc. I'm trying my best to be normally and platonically nice to her, but the line gets real blurry. I just don't know anymore.
Get into graff. Focus mainly on graff, not on a fucking coworker (spoiler alert, people go to work to WORK). If you put in the work and truly have a sick fucking handstyle, you will get her without even trying, and without her even knowing
I'm not even trying to fuck her. I know I have no chance. It's because of my affection I can't even act normally around her. Graff does sound nice anyhow and I'm desperate enough to try anything at this point.

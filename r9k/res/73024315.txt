Do not install neuralink during the 2025 china-russia horizon event mandate.
He will use the international Starlink array to control anyone from anywhere and be assimilated to the New Word Order.
Wake up.

Have you considered suicide as a vegan-friendly alternative to useless schizoposting?

THATS EXACTLY WHAT A JEW WOULD SAY TO COVER UP THE HORIZON MANDATE.
YOU FUCKING CCP SHILL FUCKING COMMUNIST COCKROACH YOU WILL DIE IN HELL

If what normal people say and what evil jews say are the same, that mean you're the one who is crazy.
YOU FUCKING CCP SHILL FUCKING COMMUNIST COCKROACH YOU WILL DIE IN HELL
Why are conspiracy theorists always so morally outraged by the ebil government controlling them when they're a bunch of morally bankrupt gun nuts who shoot up children?

I DON'T SPEAK HEBREW YOU FUCKING JEWISH CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHILL, KILL YOURSELF NOW AND DIE X3 IMMEDIATELY YOU SMELLY NIGGERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A quick hint - if you want to convince someone you're not crazy, calling them a NIGGERMAN in all caps is a bad way to do it. Your posts are useless and will never convince anyone of anything.

Elon musk is the visionary of our times
<comment>
They won't be able to cause the NWO without another decade of war and further instability. The mark is going to be a tattooed bar code on the forehead.
<comment>
How do people see this guy as some sort of genius?
All the code he wrote at x.com was scrapped after their sale/transition to PayPal because it was junk.
Apartheid Clyde is overhyped and his big genius move is to try and send humans to some desert planet with just over 1/3rd of Earth's gravity.
People are pawns for image management. They like musk because "real life tony stark" and hate Bezos because he reminds them of dr evil or lex Luthor.

It goes way deeper than that. Even the so called 'innovations' that neuralink has provided are just replicating experiments performed during research 1-2 decades ago. This man literally has not pioneered a single innovation in his companies. They're all shams. Every single one.
<comment>
Lol why am I not surprised. Also not surprising that he wouldn't give the authors of these papers any real credit in terms of public visibility.
 All shams
I mean Tesla and space x seem decent on some level.
But he wasn't a "founder" of Tesla. And basically recruited people with tons of experience from other aerospace companies to SpaceX, and then uses cheap inexperienced labour for the bottom tier/manual workforce and seems to work them like serfs. 
The real credit goes to the engineers, not this buffoon. 
Lost any ounce of respect I had for the guy after I found out how he treated the actual founders of Tesla.
<comment>

pretty sure by now the engineers and scientists working for him have told him that it's not really possible because we are centuries behind the kind of technology that would be needed to achieve that.
he is just keeping that mars thing going for share price and space launch contract reasons.
<comment>
SpaceX
All the 'innovations' like reusable stage rockets consistently cost more and probably always will. Stuff like the shuttle is an actually realistic and cost effective example or reusable space travel. You actually spend more fuel and so on reusing the second stage of the rocket just to get back what is essentially a cheap metal husk. Probably it would already be bankrupt were it not for government contracts (similar to Tesla).
Tesla
As you said he basically bought an existing electric car company and hired a decent engineer to take that and run with it. It's maybe his only truly successful venture when it comes to innovating but they spend a shitload of money paying people to do that.
He's good at marketing and securing government contracts. He's not really an inventor and some of his ideas like hyperloop show that he has absolutely no idea what goes into making practical and effective technologies.
<comment>
I'm not getting augmented in any possible way
Most I would do is maybe an arm/leg replacement if I had an injury, but only if it were purely mechanical with no online access. Even then there's a chance my organic body would reject it.
<comment>
he has some achievements in terms of popularizing tech.
Tesla wasn't revolutionary, but it normiefied the concept of the electric car (there were plenty before it, they just looked too gooft to image-conscious normalfags) and popularized the battery tech needed for electric vehicles.
and SpaceX definitely successfully exploited the need for low cost space launches.
both pretty good things.
but he is not some kind of inventor or genius. just a good hustler like businessmen are and sometimes the hustle pays off (SpaceX, Tesla) and other times it doesn't (soiperloop, Twitter purchase, the boring company, etc).
I think the jury is still out on the starlink stuff. the idea isn't bad imo, despite what politics-addled NPCs think, but we'll see if it actually delivers on its promise.
<comment>
Who is forcing you to install neuralink? You fucking mongoloid, 90% of the population is tech ignorant, how would you force them to install that shit in their brain without causing a revolution? My parents hardly know how to use a phone and you sperg about this shit, lmao fucking loser, get yourself some bitches

 Tesla 
Oh I forgot to mention - overinflated stock price based on false promises of fully self driving cars, promises like "you can use your tesla as an automated Uber" (an utter lie)
There's no way Tesla is worth more than all the other US carmakers combined, yet he's able to get away with selling $40 billion in stock, which is far far more than what the company's realistically worth
Imo he's a white collar criminal on some level (not an original opinion, as certain YouTube channel(s) have talked about this of course)
 Starlink
This is just going to ruin ground based astronomy and create a ton of hazards for future space launches. Seemed decent to me at first but then theres also the fact that these things have to be replaced every few years. The cost is insane and the potential drawbacks too great imo 
 How would you force them to
You don't. Noone was forced to buy a smartphone or agree to lengthy terms of services, they just do it cause their friends do and it offers conveniences like a nice camera, etc.
Who doesn't want to be able to watch YouTube videos in their head while commuting to work? Or trade stock right as they open their eyes and get out of bed?
I doubt musk can get this shit to do anything, but when the right tech comes along, humans won't have to be "forced" to do anything

neuralink 1.0 and 1.1 will be great, real game changers. neuralink 2.0 will make you a drone lol elo nthe autist will be dead and buried by then or replaced. Or his businesses will tank and Apple will take the lead.
Either way, this is a game changer. Individuals will get it, society probably shouldn't. A 90 IQ groid will never utilize it for anything more than hyper powering dumb actions for dumb goals, meanwhile it is inherently a liability to have something integrated with your brain. Problem is: soon we won't need any plugs regardless. Autists will invent remote brain scrambling so efficient it will disable or brainwash w/o physical contact. Only way to be save will be to put barriers between you and foreign electronics.

Starlink
Satellite internet already exists and is cheaper and better than what Starlink is proposing. (viasat and hughesnet). Not to mention just like all his other companies he got a huge government grant for it and then failed to even deliver what was promised. If you look into ANY of his projects you just find that all the ideas are retarded and unoriginal.

PS the alternative of giving a GAI its own emergent dopaminergic system (the goal you program it with) and even ego... is much worse than having cyborg screwheads walking around. Much worse. What we got now is just a language model. Something dumb to be plugged in into a real AI. That AI will be the best liar and con artist in history.
<comment>
Neuralink 1.0 will never even be released. It's a company that HOPES to MAYBE be able to help extremely disabled people, and probably will fail at even that. Elon just made up the additional capabilities despite every researcher on earth disagreeing that it's possible, including the ones working there.

You are out of touch, nobody want that. I'm talking irl, not online, only my cuck tech coworker talk in those meme terms, all my old friends/classmates/family wouldn't care less about those two things you just listed. Just like me. This is also body modification, it's fucking taboo
<comment>
You don't because you're not an idiot.
Even if my examples are bad, theyll find some use case
 This is also body modification, it's taboo
Not sure where you live but noone in the modern world gives a fuck. It's not the same as getting a dumb looking lizard tongue, wouldn't class it the same
Prosthetic legs are also "body modification" in some way.
<comment>
Idk anon, the only way i see neuralink becoming popular if they make them completely incompatible with phones, so if you want to call a friend that has neuralink and not a phone you need one too

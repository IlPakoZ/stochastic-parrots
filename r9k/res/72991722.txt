The farting sound comes from your ass cheeks clapping together like King Kong, the size of your ass cheeks would only modify pitch. Just like in a horn instrument, it's the rate of air coming through and the size of the hole that affects volume. If you push a lot of air through a small hole, it'll be really loud. If you push a lot of air through a larger hole, it would be quieter. So volume for your farts would be a mixture of how much air is passing through your sphincter and how clenched your cheeks are.

do louder farts smell better? and how about taste?

how the fuck is everyone else smart enough for college. everyone i know has been able to attend and not drop out and complete their courses, how are people so intelligent.
<comment>
it doesn't require intelligence. it requires only obedience.

you probably have an undiagnosed mental condition

Classes are harder at different colleges or even with different professors. 
Professor Hardass: Has multiple group projects, requires tons of outside work, extremely hard grader, tried to make me re-do my entire project that was started in a different class (we take part 1 then part 2 to finish the project)
Professor Rational: Has two group projects, requires normal amount of homework, fair grader, said my project was fine
If I had stayed in the first class it would've wasted so much of my time doing extra work for no reason.

Depends on the course, the professor and how much of a personal affinity you have with the subject material.

It's just turning in assignments and college is essentially cooked with the new AI shit that makes everything stupid easy
<comment>
I have the exact opposite experience. Everyone I know is either not doing great or dropped. Sucks honestly because I have nobody to talk to

maybe if you're doing a meme degree marked off assignments instead of exams

Its not intelligence, its drive. Normal people are naturally driven to do something if they're told to do it. We dont have that. We're thinking of the absurdity of society and how the system is set up. Normal people will stab themselves with a knife if it was trending on tiktok. To them, social acceptance is paramount. Its equal to being alive. So they'll study and study if getting the degree guarantees them a good life. 
Me personally, I didn't give enough of a shit even though I was the smartest person in all my classes. I had no drive because I knew it wasn't going to make life better or easier if I made more money doing some bullshit fake job that didn't help anyone.

It takes discipline bro.
I just have one assignment left and then my thesis to do. And then I've got a masters

Not really an intelligence thing. Any retard can go through college, you just need friends and confidence. Not everyone is that fortunate.
<comment>
I really do not understand why people say is hard. Just do not party everyday, try to study for the exams. ATTEND THE CLASSES and you will not be an idiot. It is not that hard, is just tedious. Literally is easier than highschool.
IF you do not get a class or a subject, just ask to the professor or your classmate. Maybe you will meet good people or even more.

i dropped out of community college after dropping out of hs and getting a GED
i dont think its intelligence, because i do well in games that reward that. i think its being able to show up on time, pay attention to stupid boring work, be productive
normies developed such habits through years of positive reinforcement growths in school. thats why females are doing so well in school right now, and men are not. because females are worshiped in out society
and college doesnt particularly reward weirdos with idiosyncratic philosophies. they reward people with good memories and a hard work ethic, who put in huge amounts of work
dont worry tho, soon all of them will be automated from jobs and will be neets
<comment>
For me it was about making deals with other students
I'll do the group project for class x all by myself and you do it for class y
And I didn't do it myself but fucking cheat on your tests, ideological purity has no place in college
<comment>
I graduated with honors and dean's list,
passing classes in school doesn't mean you are smart; it just tests how well you can follow directions and not fuck up, the entire education system sets us up to be wageslaves
<comment>
tbf im not american but my brother taught me the cheat code to uni which was just being friendly with teachers (not suck up). i almost failed my a levels cause i have the worst self discipline ever but uni has been so great to me. i took my teacher thrifting a few weeks ago for some dresses and she loved it lol
<comment>
Passing university isn't hard because lecturers have a lot of leeway in terms of how they assess students, doing well is harder because you can very much encounter shit lecturers who decide to mark everyone down for no reason. But you arguably have more support as well, as not only do you have lecturers, but also teaching assistants. Ask them nicely and they can give you a lot of help.

be productive
yeah that's basically it, all of western society is driven by this, what is and isn't "mentally ill" is determined based on whether you wage quietly and make your boss lots of money or if you don't. all positive/negative stereotypes are derived from this.
because females are worshiped in out society
because women parse information through a consensus filter and are easily psyopped, it's why independent thinking is so harshly demonized, a large part of why public school exists now is to train normies (particularly boys) to stop being critical thinkers and go with the crowd

and what degree do you do?

Nigga, I got into a bad university for a shitty liberal arts degree. I graduated with a GPA of 2.1 by barely trying. Just aim for a shitty school. I also find that the format of the course is important. Most of the courses I took had: 1 essay, 1 mid term, and 1 final exam. I avoided all other courses with different format. You have to also remember that TA's don't give a fuck and will pass you as long as write down something remotely coherent. The only problem is I graduated in 2013 and since then I've worked at nothing but shitty cashier jobs. That being said I'm a pretty big deadbeat.

People with good "networking" can get exams/tests from previous years so they know beforehand what comes out in general terms. They can also get access to decent work groups for projects.
Those who dont have that are basically doing it in hard mode, hence the dropping out. Combine this with an absolutely miserable life of solitude of nothing but study and walking between home/the dorm and the campus and it gets harder. College is, above all things, a filter to remove the poor and socially excluded. Most of whats learned isnt even applied to the real world job market.
They are not special, they just had it easier.

In actuality, you must be below-retard levels of intelligence based off your post. I know actually mentally retarded people that graduated college. It's not hard. Especially now when most colleges don't even require any papers outside of english class.
<comment>
going to school is literally the easiest part of life. average intelligence and the tiniest work ethic go a long way. 
all i do is study for 10 minutes for a subject and i ace all my exams

This is the crux of it for me. When it came to the end of high school everyone was whipped into a frenzy because you're "supposed" to go to college, then you're "supposed" to get a career, and on and on it goes. It never affected me, I just wanted to chill. Now I'm 25 and I still just want to chill.

smartest person in his class

College hasn't required intelligence for the last 30 years, you can go to college too if you really want to bro it's not that hard to get in debt.
<comment>
90% is showing up. I'm a software engineer and I have seen people and worked with people way higher than me, that are dumb af, I actually ask my. Most people just fake it, we all have insecurities find something you like doing and that makes you money and work on it
<comment>
College is easy as fuck retard. Do the bare minimum, suck up to professors, get involved with classmates so you can mooch off them. Graduate

I dropped uni once when covid started, I started it again after almost 2 years because my parents were tired too see me being a neet (I didn't even try to find a job because I'm too afraid to fuck up and getting fired).
I honestly want to drop it again because I'm not able to find any friends (most of my uni collegues are female and I'm too fucking scared to even look at them) and also because I have a hard time to focus on books and finding a reason to continue. The really fucked up thing is that I wasted my scolarship money on futile things and now if I don't pass at least 4 exams before november I'm gonna be in debt for almost 5k euros (my parents are poor and can't afford to pay that much), I'm seriously considering to an hero if I get in debt but I'm afraid I'd also be too coward to do that

Normies have a network of homework cheating and collaberation where they basically all collectively fail upwards by propping each other up. Spergs and psychopaths individually succeed because they can singly handle the intellectual load, while lower iq autists and sociopaths fail out and wonder how anyone does it
<comment>
College is fucked in so many ways. In regard to debts, I dropped out in 2017 after a full year of university, and it took us (poorfags) five years to pay off the loans taken out to pay for my time there. And my brother did graduate from college, and he and my mother will be paying off the loans for the better part of the next decade. He's been out of school since 2017. I will never go back to school because I am going to be poor forever.

Lol, i have a stateassessed iq of 145. I dropped out of highschool to follow powerlifting, going well but between training, working and sleep i have 0 relationships, my family besides my mother forgot i exist lol

Has nothing to do with intelligence and has everything to do with the willingness to follow directions and lacking a soul. You also have to value social conformity above all other instincts regardless of impact. Colleges are brainwashing factories.

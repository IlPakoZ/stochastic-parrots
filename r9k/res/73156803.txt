I'm having a hard time breaking through with DMT this time around. First time doing it alone.
When I did it together with others it was easier to let go and blast off. Breath taking visuals and no sense of self or the normal world. Good stuff and good vibes. Felt protected.
This time it feels like I'm fighting it and ending up in some weird, not super enjoyable, in-between state.
 time slows down
 one breath feels like an eternity
 hd vision
 something tells me "it's ok. just relax and let go"
 i close eyes and start to get some visuals
 part of my body starts to "dissolve" as in, I can only feel some parts of it
 I try to keep control of my thoughts and body. Don't want to let go
 negative visuals start to form (doomsday fire-ish)
 force my self to open eyes
 immediately hit with negative thoughts and unpleasant feeling
 feels like a punishment for being a pussy unable to let go
Anyone can relate? I guess this could be due to half assed doses. But fuck.. it's scary to "die" alone.

Part of you is likely just scared and holding back. You need to rip it all as fast as you can in one 1-2 hits imo if you really want to break through. It's even easier with changa. I basically only consume changa these days. I don't even measure it out, I just pack a bowl intuitively and rip it all in 1-2 hits and am basically immobilized completely every time. I absolutely love changa, one love brother.

Yep. I have a APX volt now so it's easy mode but I'm pussying out. I'll just have to force myself to fill up my lungs properly, thanks

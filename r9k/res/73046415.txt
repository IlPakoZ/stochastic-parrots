no one says this
yeah literally never heard this saying ever before. I wouldn't like me taking a shit being on the front page paper and yet I have to do it pretty much daily.
Someone said it OP once and he's either still butthurt about or he's still seething about it. He chooses to express his acute anal annihilation in the traditional language of seething zoomers - soiquotes.
Obviously, OP has, which says a lot about him.
Imagine being so ass hurt over what someone said to you it haunts you for longer then a decade past when said medium went out of style.
There is a law of internet physics which states that for every largely unmoderated post made on a board, the total amount of butt hurt must increase. We just have the bad luck to live in kali yuga when the butthurt pushes out everything else.
That is a veiled threat to slander me.

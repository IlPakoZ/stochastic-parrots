I don't know if it's just me but for the past two years 80% of the girls on Tinder were ugly; and they're ugly because 80% of the girls on Tinder were obese or fat
The rest of them are, skinny or thicc, above average Stacies and Beckies. Which means a guy like me is fucked
What happened to the average looking girls that used the app from 2016-2020?
Could it just be my city or state? Or is it a bigger phenomenon?
Girls do not exist. Do not go outside or you will die.
why is he on there
damn why am i so fucked up
So you have something in common, which is great
I'm average looking and even if I was ugly I'm still not obese or fat like most of the women on that app
I deserve my looksmatch at the very least
Looksmatch means you match based on looks and nothing else. If you are only matching with fat girls, thats your looksmatch
I believe it started around 2019 or around the time Covid started.
I'm assuming you live in the U.S. If that's true maybe it's a U.S thing.
So a skinny average looking man is on the same level as an obese woman now? Wow. I fucking hate the year of our Lord 2023
Lol no it's not
yes because a lot of skinny guys like fat/obese girls have you not seen that it's commonplace
I do live in the US. That Covid theory makes the most sense but I also feel like maybe the average girls are using different apps or something
You can hate the year or you can learn that dating apps are not real.
Maybe Black or African guys. Also thicc/thick is not the same thing as fat or obese. I'm tired of seeing girls put "thicc" on their fucking bio when they're 230lbs fat asses.

Basically I might lose my job because I tried to be nice and positive in a toxic work environment.
Yummy more meat for jabba.
keep insisting you didn't mean anything by it, you just wanted to be nice on a slow day. Doubt you'll get fired, you'll just get talked to.
Unlucky that you encountered a sub 10IQ person. Everyone knows if you get extra food in your meal, you count it as a blessing.
Unless you already stupidly confessed to what you did, in the meeting tomorrow claim total ignorance.
Just say you got distracted and must have miscounted.
If you in any way claim you intentionally gave him more nuggets, it won't matter what your real reason was. They will side with the hambeast just because she's the customer.
this isn't true at all. Customers are easier to replace than workers for low wage hell jobs, and OP did nothing to escalate the situation, he just did a thing that rubbed the customer the wrong way and the customer caused a scene. If something like this happened at my store, we'd ban the customer and talk to the worker about not wasting food.
get a different job OP. honestly. where theres a BK there must be other chains. BK locations always look nasty and have grouchy people kek.
Whatever you do,dont admit that you gave away stuff for free. Mr.Noseberg will not be happy hearing that.
That's fucked up. Go work somewhere else, that sounds way too shitty. I used to work at a TGI Fridays and it was basically . Luckily my job now is comfy most of the time anyway

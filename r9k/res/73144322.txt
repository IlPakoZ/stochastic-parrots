This board used to be my home. I'd be here every single day from around 2014-2017. I can't believe how bad it's gotten.

I've been here since before the board was deleted and it's only gotten better with time in my opinion.
I prefer coomerposting and incelcore misogyny over how it used to be where everyone called each other "gentleman" and wrote cringy greentext stories.

I don't like the coomerpoasting, those poasts on /b/ are what drove me off and onto here in the first place.
/b/ used to be a comfy place of random commentary and now it's just porn, porn, porn all the fucking time.
Don't let it happen to /r9k/ bros

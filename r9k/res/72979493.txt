for the NEETs here:
what do you plan to do when you can't live at home with your parents/caretakers anymore (for example, if they die?)
do you think about your futures or do you just live each day as it comes?
how are you not living in constant anxiety?
Trying to avoid that right now as up and coming 39 year old. I don't want to be in a care home at 60 because in my experience from a third person view it sucks. Seen some really messed up people (IE Mentally Ill) go through bad care homes for those that have mental health issues. If your high functioning, you don't want to be there with those much more fd up then you are.
Right now I'm going back to college to get at least a decent job and if that doesn't work out, I'll wage cuck it because I don't want to be with incredibly insane people who are still capable of throwing a punch at age 60...

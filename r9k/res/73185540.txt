am femanon, 26 years old
eat and drink like absolute dogshit my entire life
overweight but had a completely flat stomach, almost all my weight went to my legs
until this year
belly plumped out about a year ago, has started getting a little bit of an overhang to it in the past couple months
weight is still the same but my body just looks different now
Take care of yourself. I didn't care about my weight because I liked having big legs, but I was expecting to maintain this shape forever for some reason.

When you get older your metabolism slows down so you have to change your diet to match it lest you face the consequences of looking like the average American.

Fake architect, true architects strive to cultivate a bottom heavy sow. True architects avoid the belly door as long as possible.

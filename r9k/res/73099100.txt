I'm just so fucking miserable, robros. I'm trying my best every single day to continue to improve my life and myself, but it all feels so pointless. I'm so angry and bitter at society. Every normalfag I interact with just says the same shit over and over and they are just the same personality copy and pasted with minor tweaks here and there. It's fucking insufferable. I completely lack the ability to connect with most people beyond the normalfag persona I put on in order to get by. Women are even worse. I fucking detest putting on a monkey suit and being the person they want me to be just so I get a crumb of attention from them. It's grating dealing with them when they say and do the stupidest shit imaginable. I can't even settle for a normalfag woman and grit my teeth because 90% are used up whores who have no redeeming qualities whatsoever besides being a warm wet hole. I can't even enjoy sex with them, because I just feel an overwhelming sense of shame and disgust after because I'm not in love with them. Everyone and everything is just so dog shit.

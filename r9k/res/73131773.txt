try normiebook dating
get ghosted within three messages when I get a reply
start chatting with girl, who sends me an invite to talk on Messenger
she asks if I live in a town on the other side of the province
say no, tell her the above - I live on the other side of the province
she blocked me after saying it won't work out
Can't blame her, but I find it funny that she blocked me after having a boring "hi how are you" tier exchange

Shit sucks, but I don't blame women for sounding absolutely done in online dating. They get a shitton of people talking to them, you'd get tired, too.
God, It feels hopeless sometimes.

How the fuck do you even date on Facebook? I only use it to keep in touch with people I thought were cool that I've met along the way and buy cheap shit from the marketplace.

Badly apparently lmao. I am trying that Facebook Dating thing for shits and giggles, "just in case". I rarely get matches in my city... Not surprised, as my "City" has, at most, 20k people. I usually keep my FB to keep in contact with coworkers and family
Yeah I don't blame women for being done. They have the inverse problem most guys have. It sucks for men tho

I found out that my best friend's wife is dying.

My sister's best friend is dying right now. It's really fucking with my head. I knew this girl when I was really young, she was a neighborhood kid. It's very weird. I'm not like 'crying' type sad, but thinking about it gives me this morbid, black, deathly feeling. It's really horrible.

Yeah bro, I just don't really feel like doing anything cause I can't get death off the mind

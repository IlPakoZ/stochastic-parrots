Through some kind of sheer luck, I managed to get a few individual friends together into a discord server and they all befriended each other. Stayed this way for the last 3 years until the past year when it all started to deteriorate over seemingly stupid bullshit. I'm out of college now and I'm surrounded by pretty much only women at work. My best friend, who is also part of this friend group, is about to move across the country for his postgrad.
What the fuck do I do? I was basically a loner for my entire childhood, and just when I managed to get a real group of people for a short time it's all going to disappear.

Sad to say anon, but it's over. The reality for late bloomers in friendship is that unless your catch-up is extremely rapid and results in a huge variety of friends and acquaintances, it'll always be shortlived and end in tragedy. 
When friend groups deteriorate to noticeable extents, the real damage is done and generally can't be repaired, only papered over. Don't waste your time trying to fix things or force an old dynamic that's now long dead, just enjoy what few good times remain and bow out before everyone else storms out. 
Your life, like many of us who got unlucky with friends, will probably be stagnant and lonely, but that's just the harsh truth of it. Adulthood provides no opportunities to form true friendships beyond normie grumbling about work, talking about the family you'll never have with a boring father or mother, or other really bland, repetitive subject matter. Your days of true interpersonal connection are over. It sucks but there's not much that can be done once you're past 21

Thats just how it is. 18 - 24 is the most turbulant time for friendships because its when people's lives change rapidly, people drift apart very naturally in those years.

You're probably right, everywhere you go as an adult in the workforce is not conducive to making friendships or connections with people at all. I have a half-brother who is quite a few years younger than I am but very similar to me in many ways. I'll try to make more time for him so hopefully I can have a close friend as I age.

this, it also becomes a lot harder to make friends afterwards.

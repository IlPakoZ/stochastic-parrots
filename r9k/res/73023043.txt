you all watching fishtank too? got the whole thing streaming
Anon what is THAT.
That has got to be the gayest room I have ever seen.
I'm disappointed in you, anon.
*Farts on OP* Stream that straight into your lungs
nevermind him>>73023056 it may be gay as fuck, but I like your vintage keyboard
That's a real fuckin' neato setup.
Really diggin' the Hyundai monitor in particular.
Gotta say I'm legit jealous and also proud of you for taking the time to put that together Opie.
thanks anon i dont pay the power bill at this shithole apt so i can use as many energy demanding gadgets as id like
appreciate it anon i dug it out of an old decrepit garage full of ewaste. gives a great click
Unicomp still sells them, have one myself
what is the monitor with the green text all the way on the right and what do you use it for? i'd love to get one of those. it looks cool but it would be even better if i could figure out a practical use for it
You could probably fit at least two more monitors in there,,,, if you tried hard
I'm never going to watch whatsoever this is, but I would appreciate a qrd

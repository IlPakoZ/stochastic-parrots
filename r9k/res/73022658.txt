As it turns out, the simple act of socialization can repress your urge to rub one out.
You just need to talk to somebody when the mood strikes. Whether it be in-person, through texting, or even on this very board, conversation makes for a solid distraction

Why would you want to stop fapping?

i agree. fapping is easier

I wasn't even actively trying to stop this time.
I had just been talking to people a lot more than usual these past few days, and I only now noticed I hadn't done it in a while.

so if i just continually socialize with others, my urge to fap ceases? sounds like a scam. and why would i even want that

Some people wanna do nofap, but struggle. 
I can't confirm if the socialization thing works for everyone, but it unintentionally worked well enough for me.

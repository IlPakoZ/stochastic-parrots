all i do is make things worse
did this with a gecko my cat attacked, walked outside after giving him some water and he was being devoured by ants. Made me feel bad. This is going to happen to me one day...
at least you can blame the ants
not that ants can really be held responsible for their actions
but that wasn't all your fault - the ge ko might've lived were there no wayward ants
Sometime you have to try and fail but even a small action can feel good in the world
Don't be so hard on yourself, fren. You tried to do a good thing. Sometimes it doesn't workout but we still have to try. How else can we expect there to be any good in this world?
thats the equivalent of giving a cow some milk
You tried your best Anon, don't feel bad for that. That bee allowed you to know what to do next time. Sadly when their stinger are like this, there is nothing much to do anymore.
Similar things have happened to me. Not pleasant experiences.
But this is life. It is hard to accept that we cannot save everyone or everything. Sometimes we mess up and make things worse and other times we are successful. That bee is in peace now. Same for the gecko. Nature works in a brutal way but in the end it isn't evil. We are part of this big mess and the best thing we can do is to live until our time comes.
Keep having a kind heart. You will still make mistakes but learn from them so you can improve that help you provide.
Yeah? No shit, they're both super nutrient dense food they produce to strengthen and grow their young. It's exactly what you should give them when they're injured or sick.
You tried, you felt compassion for a fellow creature, and you did your best. That's something to be proud of.
that was a girl bee

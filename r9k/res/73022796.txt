and yet again hons give cute passing tranners a bad reputation
sigh many such cases
<comment>
Well you trannies are a demographic you know. These people are in your demographic. Obviously the ones who are monstrous are more noticed than those who look like real women because if you look like a real woman why would anyone notice you?
Either way, you'll only be "cute and passing" for so long. Your Y chromosome will catch up to you eventually.

cute passing tranners
no such thing
<comment>
I didn't know that was a tranny first time watching it. Too late now. Though. I'd stuff her useless womb like a Thanksgiving Dinner.

Older tranners can still pass and aren't hit with menopause since they consistently are on HRT. But nobody's cute into their 90s lol.

just a chaser
I honestly feel bad for trannies. plenty of guys will hook up with them, but honestly would you date one? marry one? likely not.
They'll just be used and abused until they eventually expire
<comment>
i would gladly marry a trans girl over a cis one
cis women are the devil but trans women? depending on how much male thought process they still have would be a better life partner in every possible way 
havent had much luck finding trans girls irl though

incorrect, you're still a fag

how does the "y chromosome" catch up to you when its literally just estrogen dictating your looks?
<comment>
he will never be a woman

<comment>
Men on estrogen are never women even the slightest passing ones will lose it by 30

Keep in mind this is post facial feminisating surgery, just in case any of you would be trannies on this board think surgery will save you.

Get your eyes checked. Or you're lying. Fag

Yeah, I'm attracted to passing ones too. But form a long relationship with one? No thanks

Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.

First for INFJ-T and attention~! \(^o^)/
<comment>
your type
INFJ
Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Sometimes
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
The ones who are around me.
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
I don't care about that.
How do you deal with headaches?
I just wait until it stops.
<comment>
your type
INTJ, I haven't taken the test but that's what my older brother coined me. 
Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Maybe by the way I dress and my style but I'm also kinda quiet. 
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
People like me, so othef INTJS I guess. Also people who are attracted to me ofc. 
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
Yes, I wish more toilets would cold approach me. I sure as hell am not going to. 
How do you deal with headaches?
I rub tender points of my neck and take 1g of paracetamol, always works for me.

gives turbie attention
I'm glad it was archived because it means turbie got to say first again and get some attention.
<comment>
Fe users asks me what I think of the shoes they want to order
I say they are ok not my style but if you like it that's fine
suddenly they don't like the shoes anymore because they know I don't like them
I can tell they truly want those shoes but my 'disapproval' made them not want it
I push them to buy the shoes and they are the ones to will wear them so my opinion doesn't matter
nope it's over, just fake approval next time for their sake
Why are fe fags like this
<comment>
I am sad the last thread archived, but at least I got to wish anons goodnight.
your type
INTJ
Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Not often, I try to be discreet or deflect attention when it happens usually, so I am often forgotten if others are not persistent in seeking me out.
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
People who don't perceive my introversion as hostility, perhaps.
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
I am content to dwell without nourishment in my desert soul forever, but some in this world I am drawn to, for reasons hard to articulate.
How do you deal with headaches?
I have one right now, I think aspirin, coffee and carrots help.
Did you read a physical copy of it?
I did not, but I would like to own a physical copy of it, although that book is unusually expensive.
And whats the reading experience like, stuff like Jung feels quite dense and hard to read
It's hard to say, I don't quite "read books" as an activity, rather, something leads me to a particular book, and guides me throughout reading it, like certain questions or new directions of thought that I am seeking.
With The Red Book I found interesting how it reflects most of Jung's later works in their germinal/embryonic form. Parts of it were quite emotional as well, such as Jung describing how Salome (his inferior feeling/anima) stole his love, how she only wanted to serve him and make him happy, yet he needed to abandon her. I think many who have endured the pain of love would be touched by it.

you could ask that about literally any hobby or interest. most of us have barely even scratched the surface

nah, this might be the best general on /r9k/ (as long as you filter every namefag and 90% of the posts as there's a shitton of filler)

<comment>
I'm glad it was archived because it means turbie got to say first again and get some attention.
Yes that is good. 
I can tell they truly want those shoes but my 'disapproval' made them not want it
That would be because their introversion is repressed, and the extravert cares more about the collective/objective value, so the fact that you disliked them caused them to no longer in fact want the shoes. I don't know the full context, but perhaps a middle ground would be for you to try to understand what they liked about the shoes first, before offering your view?

Your type
INFJ (EII/Fi-N/5w4)
Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
No and no. I try not to be seen at all.
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
God knows what type of people notice me. All kinds of them. But primarily, specifically, I'm a fan favorite of INTPs for some reason. Guess it's because I admire their weirdness and individuality and I give them interesting ideas back - and this makes me contemplate my personality typing and whether it's right or not. Don't know, it's a mystery, I might be some undercover INxP, what I wrote down as my type resonates with me close enough. I'm unaware of INxP/INFJ relationships but I presume they'd be irritating due to the clashing of functions (Ni/Ne).
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
No. Unless these *people* were of my own type.
How do you deal with headaches?
I go to sleep.
<comment>
Why do you think the other anon hated you a couple of threads ago?
<comment>
i thought it was cute..
<comment>
What anon? I don't remember anyone hating on Homu. At worst they jokingly call him a slut.
<comment>
I found puzzles I want to post tonight if anons want to do them with me. 
I feel insensitive giving my opinion on others, so I hope that it is not taken a wrong way, but I do hope that Turbie attains self-realization as a life born to spread its light in all directions, never being cruelly mutated against its will. 
I'm unaware of INxP/INFJ relationships but I presume they'd be irritating due to the clashing of functions (Ni/Ne).
This is supposed to be a relatively common and compatible pairing, if I recall correctly. 
In general, extraverted and introverted types can be complementary depending upon the life situation, but the situation is always changing. If the life situation changes and the individuals remain the same, that is when they may be driven into conflict. Jung emphasizes often that the law which is valid in the morning of life can not be valid for its noon.

I don't know why, I hope it wasn't something I did to upset them.

ENTP
Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
I used to when I was younger. I became more self conscious and restrained as I grew up.
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
xSFJs, ExxPs and xNFJs.
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
Sometimes, but I may end up regretting when they do. 
How do you deal with headaches?
If it's really bad, I'll lay in bed for a while.

<comment>
no it isn't, why do you ask?
<comment>
There used to be an INFJ here by that name. He was... not a good person. Glad you're not him.
<comment>
How about you tell us about yourself, anon? Curious as to what kind of person you are. I almost became friends with an ISFJ dude back in 2021 but I don't see him around anymore on this general... You're INFJ, I know, but close enough.
<comment>
that sucks.. when did he post here?
ok, what do you wanna know?
<comment>
Nothing overly specific, just... How would you describe yourself? So you're most likely a male, a self-proclaimed 'INFJ', in your twenties, who browses 4chan and... What else is there to your personality? What do you do in life and what are your interests? What boards do you frequent? Stuff like that.
<comment>
2017-2019, mainly. Stalker, emotional abuser and manipulator, BPDemon, serial doxxer. He might or might not be in jail now, I dunno. Hope he is.

nice trips .. so i am a male in mid-20s, currently in school (should be doing work but fuck it), i mostly browse /x/ and a/a and thats it, i mostly just like watching spooky documentaries, anime, and shit like that. don't have many friends. 
was he in this thread? what made you think i was him?
<comment>
I have something to admit
I love Fe users
t.INFP
<comment>
He posted in here a few times, unfortunately, though his presence was blessedly rare. No particular reason besides the fact that he also posted anime girls and was an intermittent poster here.
<comment>
nice trips ..
Oh, sweet!
so i am a male in mid-20s
Yep.
currently in school
Right, I'd be in school if I wasn't a NEET.
i mostly browse /x/ and /a/
I like that, although /x/ gets on my nerves with the amount of bait threads it has. Still, decent board, I respect the schizophrenic rambling. /a/ I do check myself from time to time but it doesn't have the particular anime threads I want. Some advice: Broaden your board horizons! There's about five more (possibly even more than that if you won't tire from manually hiding bait threads on all those other boards, though filters are a thing) cool boards that have decent content. Then again... that depends on your interests. Anime and the paranormal are fine by me.
don't have many friends.
Neither do I. Got about three, whom I've met in real life, everyone else is kind of more of an acquaintance than a true *friend*.
Dunno, man. You'll find someone. I don't want to fiddle with Discord or whatnot currently. Check /soc/, even though you need a proper 4chan filter for that trash heap, only the Discord threads are okay if you get lucky.

I don't think there's a specific type. Whoever wants to, does most of the time.
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
I'm content with the current amount. I'd like to avoid unwanted attention, who doesn't?
How do you deal with headaches?
Get off devices. Drink some water. Eventually try to sleep it off.

Mistyped ISTP.

I'm open to the possibility. I've been typed as INFJ for most of my life and take quizzes every few years or so, thanks for the brief insight anon.

I didn't see that, but it is true perhaps, at least I wouldn't fight if my presence was unwanted, although my feelings would be hurt, but I hope this does not come to pass.

it can be hard not to notice me. i dont like it like that though. mostly i get a lot of attention i dont like and very little i do.
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
kids and old people tend to talk to me a lot, even when im quite. i dont really know why kids like me, or i dont feel like trying to explain myself right now; old people like me because im polite and listen.
How do you deal with headaches?
sleep.
im defiantly down for some puzzles. id also like to play dune again if anyone is up for it.
i dont think anything with an N and Z in it can be cute cause its always either gonna sound like some gross furry shit or a war crime.
<comment>
sounds good, and yeah, i could probably browse some more boards, but it seems like it takes time to get used to the culture and find good stuff on those. this thread seems mostly not bad for this board. i guess im mostly just trying to figure myself out while going to school, because by the time i'm done i feel like i should be a "complete" person. maybe i should take up reading more too.
<comment>
I don't know the full context, but perhaps a middle ground would be for you to try to understand what they liked about the shoes first, before offering your view?
Your explanation why they are like that makes sense. I'm not sure if this can solve the whole "instantly change your mind because of disapproval" thing. The only solution to avoid that seems to be echo'ing them that it looks good.
<comment>
if thats what your looking for you ought to drop reading and internet until you've got your self. 
start doing things and talking to people. if you just read and watch and listen you wont develop anything other than a social disorder. find some easy part timer to take, something with parks if your american, try out some hobbies, if you still want to read join a book club, just go do something. even just wandering around campus for 16 hours a day is better than browsing 4chan or reading kant. if you feel you need to rest read fiction or something obscure.
<comment>
INTJ as honest lmao
I guess my face expressions literally cant lie so theres that honesty but holy crap am I not honest
<comment>
Probably, I think. I try to never view my ego as the subject of things that are happening around me, so I am not too inclined to be drawn into fights even where my feelings are deeply involved, with few exceptions, like if someone I care for is being hurt. 
OK, I have some ready that I will post later. 
because by the time i'm done i feel like i should be a "complete" person
I don't know if you should think about it in this way. The brain never stops developing, just as the self is always changing; there is no final form for you to discover. 
What can "work," I hope, is allowing your nature to guide you to ever-more refined heights of beauty and sensitivity, which involves listening to yourself.
I see, what I meant was, if you could tell that they liked the shoes, perhaps you could try to sympathize with their perspective enough to see why they like them. Then, maybe you could express your disapproval in a more nuanced manner that wouldn't provoke the aforesaid reaction from them. But, I don't know enough details, so I am not sure if my answer here is most appropriate.
<comment>
maybe i should take up reading more too
That wouldn't hurt at all! Yes, indeed. You've got access to the entire internet, if you know how to utilize it, you can find anything. If not, libraries.
But yeah, INTJ anon (>>73140254) already said what I wanted to say. School alone isn't usually enough. You need to think for yourself, via introspection and all, to find out what you truly want.
<comment>
i've thought about that, i honestly just don't like a lot of people, so jobs like that aren't appealing. so yeah maybe spending time alone on walks or in nature would be good. just something different.
What can "work," I hope, is allowing your nature to guide you to ever-more refined heights of beauty and sensitivity, which involves listening to yourself.
that sounds right. i guess i need to find what fits me. i know for a fact that i don't want what is considered a "normal" life these days, so i need to look within myself. 
i need to find my own way. i've considered psychedelics but that seems ehh, a lot of people turn to that and the outcome doesnt look good from what i've seen. i guess i should be patient.

<comment>
This is true (for me at least) and I only use this site to be nice to people because I know theyll need it. Occasionally there are threads where the posters are pleasant, like this one, and I end up staying awhile. I used to frequent imageboards back in high school, but things have been a lot better for me now.
<comment>
Are Se doms not normalfags?
<comment>
What does it mean to be normal? I think all people have their differences and are unique in there own way. If people want to call themselves INFJ I trust they know themselves better than I do.
<comment>
Obviously I'd want to do a puzzle with you, so long as you don't mind that I'm still also working on the one miss Nebuchadnezzar left me yesterday so that might make it less special.
Chapter 10 is a meme and just Jung running his mouth about bullshit, skip to the definitions where he's actually trying to say what he means instead of just verbally masturbating. It can be a bit of a choose your own adventure novel having to jump from one definition to the next but People's understanding of Jungian functions might even be better if he just cut that section out entirely.
I regard sensation as conscious, and intuition as unconscious, perception.
It's really that simple. Ni doms primarily percieve unconsciously, Si doms primarily percieve consciously. It's like sensors are "now breathing manually" except when it comes to just existing in the world.
<comment>
Don't listen to them centaur.
<comment>
Nobody's talking to me though? My Wallfriends? I've been thinking, since I'm going to be 26 soon I should start acting more like a facilitator/mentor figure to these young boys. You know the kind I never had, even here, the older anons like princess sophia, ENFJ-senpai and turbie are all entirely passive and wait for things to happen. Centaur persona or otherwise I should start smashing my head harder into making things happen happen, and start cultivating these people into the sorts of people that do things and make things happen themselves so I don't end up quite as soggy as the old starfishes, even if I do love them.

Sometimes, yes, I get angry, but the worst anger always arises from powerlessness, and once one has the power for revenge, the feeling is no longer present in the same form, so genuine catharsis is denied. I think it is best to find another way out.

INFP
Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Not purposefully
I am not sure if they do, often I felt like a ghost among men, but many other times it seems I draw people in, for whatever reason that might be, perhaps I radiate a veil of mysteriousness, or something
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
Something to ponder on.. I feel like I could give multiple contradictory answers to that, so I am not really sure, probably "direct" or assertive ones, as I keep in the background usually
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
Rather than wanting to be noticed for the sake of itself, I want to be a person that is noticeable, for the qualities I posses 
How do you deal with headaches?
Water,caffeine (aspirin has caffeine in it, I think its a vasodilator, for the brain atleast) and fresh air, luckily I dont get random ones, just when having fever or after a hard night of drinking where I forgot about having water/tea before bed
So rather than "garnering the implicit (intended) messages" you let yourself "get inspired" /ponder upon what the readings make your mind bounce to?
Oh, rereading, I just projected my reading experience, seems you have a conscious intention for reading things
For me its a rather spontaneous phenomenon, sparks leading to other sparks, never really going anywhere, continuously spinning a web, not knowing where it started or where it ends
I remember this one "chart" of Jungs works, things to start on and things to read after but I dont think I have it saved

Don't be offended aynohn. Being a reddit-addicted youtube-binging zoomer doomer schumer midwit is nothing to be ashamed about. It happens to the best of us (namely me)
NTA but revenge fantasies aren't as engaging when it becomes a plausible choice. Then it transitions from fantasy to reality and acting on your basest impulses feels more like being a bully than upholding justice. Imagine a bird goes out of its way to shit on you everyday. It ruins your ice cream, stains your tuxedo on the day of your wedding, drops a dookie into your open mouth while you laugh into the heavens uproariously, other such injustices. Then one day you see the bird with its wings stuck in a fence. It's like a 20th of your size. You could just step on it and its blood and viscera would explode everywhere, but even if you previously relished the thought actually enacting it when you have the opportunity feels deeply wrong. Same with people

trusting an ESFJ whore
She was cheating on your dad with dozens of men, as is the ESFJ norm.
<comment>
well that was a big waste of time
<comment>
That combined with low ni lack of foresight perhaps?
<comment>
Definitely not, my dad would be over her looooooong ago if that was the case. Neither of them cheated because they're still friends. Also, they're still married, just separated because divorce is expensive and neither of them plan on remarrying. Both have been single for 13 years.
Idk, maybe he's just an autist. He is a programmer after all.

ENTPs prioritize new ideas and creativity, INTPs prioritize truth and logical consistency.
What this means is that ENTPs would be more perceptive to how other people may feel. That could in turn lead to a Ne-Fe loop as mentioned in the post you replied to.

ExxJ's would not use an anonymous site. They are obsessed with attention, they wouldn't even use reddit. They'd use twitter and instagram.
<comment>
because missing someone after 13 years who you didn't bother keeping up a relationship with when you still had her is totally normal

yeah lol it'd be very stupid if there was a way to garner attention on an anonymous site. not like there's people who use specific recognizable images for attention here or anything.

Uneventful April for me, both here and irl. I'm partly to blame for it, stressing over something undeserving. However, it's looking to be followed by eventful four months. So I'm not complaining.
I think chipping/tagging a turbie (species) might be unnecessary because turbies don't move around much,
Oh, but I was hoping I could take my Turbie to parks and such. Where do Turbies usually frolic, anyway?
but then again, it might be useful should someone kidnap them! :O
I pinky promise I will only obtain Turbies by legal means!

Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
I don't think so. I've posted in the past that I tried smoking cigs last year, and there wasn't a feeling of craving as a result. Than again, I mostly experimented with the activity of smoking as a social and psychological subject/focal point onto other subjects, rather than "just smoking".
Only thing I may be addicted to is the Zeds, Zzz. The most deadly and widespread addiction.
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
No. I would be self-conscious of the mental-altercation and the cognitive "boost", which would make me nervous and resign to my shell, as does alcohol sometimes. No, getting drunk with "liquid courage" doesn't make me see pretty. Also, I don't want to talk to the dead yet.
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
I've only broken rules if they were not enforced. Which is to say, I play by the suggestions if I think they're fair.
Someone saved my oc. I'm happy :)

Normie. I used to be a chameleon but I eventually found purpose in various social relationships and motivation towards work and social image. I was an edgy art student with some delusions about the world and grew up with some chronically online NEETs that did substance abuse. However, things change when you live your life alongside others, and you chip away at the mental barriers that isolate you from other people, you realize every life is the same. Even if people present themselves differently, from normies to the socially inept, they have the same needs of someone to listen to them and someone to talk to. I eventually put aside the intimidation I felt in these differences and I'm constantly working towards being someone who can talk to anyone, despite differences in worldly views and culture. Being a normie doesn't necessarily mean having to be an NPC or to present a certain way, but to be content with your place in the world and can function to some degree.

I think the anon here explained it well >>73143521
When something menaces you from beyond your control it is very different than when it is at your mercy. In the latter case, I am almost always inclined to show clemency, regardless of what may have happened in the past. I could hardly summon any pointless cruelty if I try. 
For me its a rather spontaneous phenomenon, sparks leading to other sparks, never really going anywhere, continuously spinning a web, not knowing where it started or where it ends
I see, I would say it's more like I am "following my nose." I have a vague sense that a book or related set of ideas is important, then I start to consciously formulate questions about what I seek to understand. But, of course, there will always be more mysteries that slip through my fingers, even when I can assemble a single coherent map of meaning, as with The Red Book; in the end it only gives me new leads to follow
I remember this one "chart" of Jungs works, things to start on and things to read after but I dont think I have it saved
I could make a reading list for you if you'd like, although personally I don't find them very useful. Learning is very non-linear for me; I can read large volumes of information and learn almost nothing, or sometimes I find single sentences, paragraphs or even footnotes deeply insightful and revelatory. I suspect it is similar for many people, but I am not sure.

Do you draw attention to yourself
I don't particularly care about that unless I need the attention for something concrete.
are you noticed by others often?
I wouldn't really know, because me being noticed does not warrant me being a witness to any acknowledgement of my presence.
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
And I don't know if there's a typological consistence.
I sure tend to have quite a number of really weird encounters, though...
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
I could just change my behavior without hanging onto wishes or the feeling of having a wish.
How do you deal with headaches?
I munch on zinc supplements, I munch on acetylsalicylic acid, I munch on magnesium supplements, I start drinking more teas than usual and I try to eat something good (the last two are not even necessarily from the viewpoint of specific nutrition - sometimes my headaches are just a byproduct of hunger or dehydration and I may simply have a difficult time identifying these two without mistaking them for something else, like nausea or fatigue)

I do attempt to draw attention to myself on occasion but in mostly benign ways; blasting music in my car or the way I publicly present / walk / dress although I don't think I really need the attention although could be a cope, I like to think of it as more of a way of bolstering my image and I typically engage in this behavior around strangers so I don't really give a fuck what kind of impression it gives off.
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
I'm not really aware that anyone really notices me, sometimes I feel like a ghost floating through life, I think it's mostly myself who is involved in doing the noticing, I've never had anyone explicitly come up to me or make any comments even when I'm being outlandish.
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
Not particularly, attention is a strange thing, I only wish people that I could get along with / potential friends or kindred spirits might notice me and that would subsequently lead to something interesting, whether that be good conversation or interaction.
How do you deal with headaches?
Don't get and don't have headaches. Maybe drink some water, take a break, Tylenol?

And something related to MBTI...
Ne/Ni???
One can conceive of intuition as the preliminary perception of coherence. Since this requires holistic perception, it is hypothesized that underlying processing strategies are dependent on the possibility to obtain all relevant information at once. The present study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neural mechanisms underlying intuitive coherence perception when semantic concepts are presented all together (simultaneously) or one after the other (sequentially). 
With simultaneous presentation, absolute activation increases in the left OFC when participants recognize coherence. 
With sequential presentation activation increases in the right OFC when participants conclude that there is no common associate between the words presented. 
Behavioral performance was similar in the two experiments. 
These results demonstrate that the way information is revealed over time changes the processing of intuitive coherence perception. We propose that such changes must be taken into account to disentangle the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying different accounts of intuition and related phenomena.

If anyone out there is meant to be yours, they're yours now and will be forevermore. Don't smell desperate. You can look it if you'd like, but only if it's in the interest of digging your hooks deep before they know what's caught 'em.
What you need to worry about is hitting your mark, and making sure you're able to discern a falling star from a stage light loosed. Either way, if you're not there when it falls...
In plain English:
Work on yourself. You hardly get what you're hoping for if you make the acquisition of a partner --soulmate or otherwise-- your priority above being someone worthy of that partnership.
Sounds like your problem may have been running away from something that seemed too good to be true, or pushing it. Is that correct? Why is that? What do you need to work on to make sure the same thing doesn't happen again?

Ok, I'm not sure what you're asking here. You're asking to give you a reasoning for not making decisions based on feels?
It did get me thinking about something else tho. I've noticed when there's one issue I'm struggling with, suddenly I find 20 other ones, and I get pissed about all of them. But if this one big issue would be solved, I wouldn't give 2 shits about the 20 other problems. 
I know it's pretty obvious so far, right? 
The biggest issue is, how tf do you get to that core problem? How tf do you figure out what the core problem is?
inb4 therapist
No. So far, the only thing they've done is sit there and be wrong/ tell me shit I already know. 
The only solution I've found is trial and error plus careful observation of behaviour concerning all issues.
Another huge problem is the domino effect this might create. What if you're fixating on this one solution/ problem that you are convinced is the core problem, but it's not that. For example: you're getting angry at everything your wife does, so you get divorced, but the core problem was actually the fact that you hate your job.
I imagine there's a lot of these cases.
The more I ramble on the more I realise there is no shortterm solution and people make mistakes. And so many families are ruined for all the wrong reasons.

I evaluate pretty objectively, so I'm pretty confident. I also have no restraint. I will procrastinate, I probably won't live a healthy lifestyle and I don't have a good day to day routine. I am still confident.
how do you evaluate it?
Previous happenings, asking myself loads of questions, analysis of people's behaviour and comparing to myself, and analysing people's reaction to my behaviour.
Small note: because I observe everything like stats and information for learning, I tell everything to everyone, can't keep secrets and I'm also extremely dense. It's the one thing I'm insecure about. I'm completely clueless. Got me in a lot of trouble plenty of times. Also kept me out of trouble and brought lots of fun so I still prefer it this way.

Aries is the best rising sign along with Scorpio! ^w^
Intjs- grew up afraid to rely on people, detached and isolated
Infjs- grew up emotionally and or physically abused and isolated

I'm an Aries Rising, why is it the best?

your type
INTJ
is this literally you?
No because, first of all, I capitalize I's in my thought clouds to make them more readable.
Second, that's debased and probably even unmedicated by any pills of any colour.
The privileged position of the superior function is as detrimental to the individual as it is valuable to society. This detrimental effect has reached such a pitch that the mass organizations of our present-day culture actually strive for the complete extinction of the individual, since their very existence depends on a mechanized application of the privileged functions of individual human beings. It is not man who counts, but his one differentiated function. Man no longer appears as man in our collective culture: he is merely represented by a function, what is more he identifies himself completely with this function and denies the relevance of the other inferior functions. Thus modern man is debased to a mere function, because it is this that represents a collective value and alone guarantees a possible livelihood.

what is your self-esteem like?
Yes?
how do you evaluate it?
I estimate that my self exists? Conventional definitions of "self-esteem" are filled with something rather trivial, irrelevant and unrelated to "self" as a term, as far as I've checked, so here we are.
treating people as means to an end is the good thing
This may hold a microounce of water by the notion that dehumanizingly harsh treatment you bring may make people more resistant to future dehumanizingly harsh treatment, but that rubs off onto your personal unconscious in a negative way that, overall, brings subpar results wherever you look at it, so, never mind.

What job is fitting for someone who currently has an autistic interest in typology?
<comment>
I think creating a work alone is a nonsense goal because to create that work they need to create themselves. But I'm not sure that the tool itself is worthy art. I think pieces are a fragment or a statement about something specific, presented to evoke in a way that a person is often not.
My self-esteem is very high because I am highly self-confident. I am not so worried about stuff because I increasingly get better at all manner of things.
<comment>
How much autistic?
Knowing typologies without understanding the psychological aspects to them may be not very useful for anything specific
<comment>
Your better off choosing a job based on your type than on your interest in typology.
<comment>
Turbie how do I use this?
<comment>
If you can reliably predict human behaviour and integrate that with other skills, then you have a choice of high positions across every discipline. Typology itself is not that and is an inadequate model. If more broadly you are interested in integrating people into teams with learned assumptions from typology, then clearly some managerial route.

Anything requiring physical or interpersonal acuity! QwQ
which stereotypes of your type apply to you and which don't?
Apply: being cute~ :3 , ability to predict the future, being abstract, the doorslam, humanitarian ideals, having a Google Knowledge Panel! *^w^*
Don't apply: having magical people-reading skills, leadership capabilities, being a good therapist, giving good advice regarding personal issues or whatever! TwT
what advice would you give to someone who looks up to you?
If they're a cute femperson or aspiring to be one, I'd tell them to be/become that because the future is cute and femmy~! *^_^* To anyone (kyoot or feminine or not): things happen if they're meant to; also, keep improving, find an outlet to express yourself, and never stop loving! *^3^*;;; &lt;3
what do you ultimately want to accomplish or experience in life?
To leave a legacy I'll be eternally recognized and remembered for! \(^_^)/

<comment>
Aries: The "Warrior" archetype serves to project and protect the identity. These folks are here to develop courage, channel vitality into constructive challenges and take a proactive approach to life. Aries need to face the world with their inner confidence, so feeling powerful and comfortable regardless of the setting is essential. Sleek, sporty and sexy, or power suited for the office; your physical body has to feel and look strong to let your true-self shine. Aries' ruler is confident Mars and the placement of planet Mars in the chart is important.

What type of people tend to take notice of you?
I act nice with everyone so different kinds of people but some of them I really don't like and I wish they would stop talking to me
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
yeah I guess
How do you deal with headaches?
I hardly ever get headaches but on the rare occasion I get one I might take a paracetamol pill if it's strong enough 
what is your self-esteem like?

it simply depends how much feel-good hormones my body is pumping at a given moment so I just go with that

But isn't the available research like in the examples above has been based mostly on 16p, which is a grotesque simplification of MBTI that omits focus on cognitive functions? 
The official MBTI in no way uses "cognitive" functions on its test or terminologies. However, the functions correlate well to some aspects of any holistic personality assessment. There is at least a ~60 % correspondence between various OCEAN faucets and the functions, based on my crappy 41-question OCEAN survey. With more questions, discarding of confusion between dichotomy-particularly J/P-and function concepts, and accounting for mistypes + inherently some incompatibility between dynamic, contextual categories and scores; it's basically the same thing, desu.

Do you think there are parts of us that cannot be perceived by others, even if we try to share them, try to be known? What is your relationship to these parts of yourself?
Yeah, there are often misunderstandings especially with regards to extroverts who should to experience the perception by themselves before they can understand it! :'O I'm not sure about my relationship: on the one hand, I'd like to share some of them, but on the other hand, I'd like to keep some of them private! :Oc

INTJ
what is your self-esteem like?
I would say that my ego feels quite small relative to the world, because that is what I believe it is. But I don't think self-worth is something anyone decides; likewise, I think what is referred to as "low self-esteem" in people often simply has to do with them being perceptive and intelligent. 
https://archive.org/details/jung-carl-gustav-complete/06%20Psychological%20Types/page/n93/mode/2up
A relevant quote, truly, and something I often reflect on myself. You must bend and deform yourself so that the world can utilize you. Let it erode any hope at finding truth, and convince yourself that you are small and worthless, and this will make you "normal." But it is strange just how segmented and detached a normal person is, and what it would take for them to become harmonious. The caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis and transforms into the glistening butterfly.

At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
Maybe? Talking to the dead might be interesting but scary! :'3
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
I try to avoid cheating! ^_^

Similar to Aries Sun: competitive, sporty, stubborn, somewhat charismatic, dominant (wants to lead), confident, and wants quick and radical reformations. An Aries Rising is also direct, impulsive, good at inspiring others, and quick at taking charge of any task, and can be a hard worker!

I want sophie to make me a effiminate bitch. I want sophie to get into a hetersexual relationship with me at first. Over time I get more and more connected with her, so much that i spend less time doing other things and only focus on her. Sophie catches wind of this and over time makes me do more and more emasculating things. First it's small 
put this lip stick on... it would look SOO good on you
want to try on my panties? they look soooo cute on you
want to try on this cute pink dress?
now anon... you might be against this but... put on this cute cockcage i got for you
sophie has almost fully emasculated me... but i still have my male genetalia

at least one of your favorite activities/hobbies

When I am dissatisfied with my progress on one front, I seek other avenues to beta-test and return with toolkit polished and primed. 
In my heart, there is little room left for illusion or the coddling of those who seek refuge within it.
They can be horny without being an active detriment to their own wellbeing and that of the entire species. If they cannot, they should be corrected.
If you are not enough, no one is going to make you enough. And you likely will not get far or close as needed with your pedestalized product of witless, wishful projection to learn or accept this firsthand. It should be easily inferred by now, but that would require those-of-whom-I-speak learning anything from what goes on here, sufficiently understanding the base ingredients to extract take-away of any worth. Make whatever you will your coom material so long as you also recognize and utilize it as case study.
How do you personally benefit from 
letting people be horny 
other than playing to the whiny sides who give validation easily, and for cheap? There is more to this life than a mutually poisonous exchange of attention.
I cannot help but make a big deal of it. The implication is that I am somehow harming people or barring them from happiness when your careless and ultimately selfish highschool-girl-tier enabling is the bigger deal.
Never call me that again 
The average Te user's best application is keeping the worse offenders corralled inside the plebe pin with them. In the most panoptic and efficient way, of course.

How do you personally benefit from letting people be horny other than playing to the whiny sides who give validation easily, and for cheap? 
Why do you think validation is something you need to suffer or struggle for. Some if not most people are satisfied with easy, everyday validation from their friends and family and such. Strangers online aren't fundamentally different in principle, whether or not you think it's "cheap" or that they don't deserve to be humored means nothing. Stop being a stuck-up bitch and be confident in your own skin without the need for achievements as plating. 
There is more to this life than a mutually poisonous exchange of attention.
Poisonous to what end? Let people enjoy themselves. The world will go on without you and any meaning you try to force onto it is completely transient. Berating some incel online is a zero sum game

INFPs can be used for a lot of things

INFP's are cute and relatively intelligent. ESFP's aint got much of a use besides manual labour
<comment>
ok chumps, what's the types for this feel?
<comment>
validation is something...to suffer or struggle for
What made you think that was anywhere near what I was saying or part of the point?
validation from friends and family
Nothing wrong with that, nonetheless beside the point.
don't deserve to be humored 
I was saying they deserve much better. And even weighing however much they "deserve" to be humored against what everyone else also deserves and how humoring this sort of thing impedes that.. It's..outweighed.
Not touching the projection resulting from confusion and small sample size. But I would like you to explain what you meant by
the need for achievements as plating
so I can understand where your understanding of myself and/or my values is going off-kilter.
I am not your friend so I am not going to respond to the attempted "Damn gurl it's not that deep lowkey fr no cap" in turn with laughing it off. But I am trying not to be needlessly spiky. Without vocal tone I don't know how to come across less condescending when I largely have no idea what the hell you're going on about, how we arrived at your reply from the contents of mine. You're seemingly listing every perspective that contributes to the casual attitude you apply to these interactions, and I don't see how it all relates closely enough to be worth mentioning. I'm left feeling that you've made no effort to understand where I am coming from or what I am actually saying and that discourages me from trying even harder to best allow you to do that.
Poisonous to what end?
I've touched on that before, though I don't expect you to have read every single post I've made, and since I am largely dissatisfied with the lack of depth this format requires, I wouldn't expect you to understand my overall perspective or opinion even then.
I don't feel it wise or promising to move on to trying to clarify or restate that before all this is better addressed.

Let people enjoy themselves 
Poor substitute, what goes on here, for the joy attainable even to "incels" --right here, right now, today, not just after some long list of hypotheticals that wrongfully assumes or demands more of the people than where they are at, who they are without being forced to fit a hypothetical that does not fit them.
The world will go on...
Sure, ya nihilist. Jej. You can't argue "Let them and I waste our time however makes us happiest!" then argue it's nonsensical for me to do the same. There is a hierarchy of ultimately "meaningless" investments, though, that I do believe.
Berating some incel online is a zero sum game
I understand why you feel that way or may think that is my intent or the result of it. I see them differently and to me it is no game. I'd like for tender over tough love to get what needs doing done, but I'm experimenting.
Can you be forthcoming in a way I'm too uninformed to ask for directly? Are you an ENTJ? Do you have a crush on one of the mommyhungry Anons? What else is at stake for you? What else is going on here that would help me to better understand where *you* are coming from?

staring at the computer screen, unable to take any action for myself
Uncertainty is a big killer in the brain. It's what exhausts most people the quickest, beyond real thinking. It's because your mind is reaching and searching to make something clear and it's worse when there are external dependencies in the mix too. If you're smart you will eventually find those certain mechanisms for different situations and your endurance goes up massively. It can be a strategy or just recognising a pattern to be avoided. I've spent a lot of time in uncertain thought in many different circumstances. The only generality from that breadth is that uncertainty is a computationally hard task. Recognise it as a task because then you know to solve it.

Don't worry, I have no ego and nothing will change that.

if an infj hates jews they are mistyped infp
<comment>
All I want is Turbie's love. That's literally all I want.
<comment>
True. A real INFJ would recognize Jews as a pest (not hateworthy by themselves, as any INFJ would agree) and simply seek to unemotionally rid his society of them for the greater good for his own people. The actual "hatred" would just be theatrics for the masses. Any real INFJ would equally recognize the Jews' nepotism as an ideal to strive for. 
The Jews are simply an enemy, and there's no real reason to hate them for it.

hitler was an infp in a fi-si loop
<comment>
I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but I've been trying to figure my mind out for a couple of years now. I recognize some recurring thoughts and ideas, and at the end of the day nothing ever gets accomplished, because I don't know what I want. As a kid, I didn't even care to think about things to do, if I felt like doing something, I just did. But now I don't even know what to do, yet I feel stressed all the time because of how much time I am wasting.
<comment>
As if. You talk about tumblr loops, while his entire character was 100% in conjunction to INFJ.

You people and your retarded hot takes, i swear
<comment>
your type
INTP.
Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Only at academic places/situations.
What type of people tend to take notice of you?
Various/Different types.
Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
No.
How do you deal with headaches?
I have migraine and am undergoing neurological treatment.
First time here;
I want to be a forest dweller, I also like to draw webcomics. However my family wants me to use my above average cognitive abilities for boring things like working in research or something stereotypically smart. College dropout because yeah, currently NEET. XD

Hello newfriend. ahem. Do ya like thinking?
<comment>
ENFJ
in a stereotypical ENTJ job
I don't think so. Ti is the inferior function for ENFJ, which leaves that Te of banker-faggots at the absolute very last possible position, so there's fuck-all chance of him being ENFJ. He'd never have gotten the job in the first place, were he ENFJ.
<comment>
custom built for pegging
<comment>
Definitely an ENTx, don't know how you could possibly think he's a feeler
<comment>
not even a hot take, he showed much more Fi then anything
<comment>
Deeply unhealthy ENTJ
<comment>
He clearly has prominent Fe. The thing he cares most about is validation by others and his social standing. 
I guess that he could also be an ExTP stuck in a loop.
<comment>
driven by his will to enact his suffering on others
Fe
<comment>
Wtf type is this?
<comment>
probably dumb Ti looks autistic and low bandwith many word few say
<comment>
I don't really see him as an intuitive either. Turbulent ESTP seems fair.
<comment>
By dumb Ti do you mean low Ti, or too much?
<comment>
he doesnt.
but some people do have that plan and they do things like work 2 jobs, learn practical skills, camp when ever they can, horde metal, track population trends and population prices. all in an effort to eventually own good land and be divorced from the system. other people know you cant starve in this country and just drift, but those kinda people dont plan for anything.

NiTi / MBTI INFJ
Just say INFJ. An Ni-Ti is practically indistinguishable from Ni-Fe. You think you're making it easier to be defined, but you're actually making it more convoluted.
<comment>
Based and truthpilled. The world was not ready for the INFP dictator.
<comment>
other people know you cant starve in this country and just drift, but those kinda people dont plan for anything
that sounds cool but i don't think i'd ever do it
thats for ExxPs who go around befriending random people. introverts need a solitary log cabin in the middle of nowhere
<comment>
Am I hearing this right? You think a purely neutral state of mind is at all Fe aligned? Ni-Ti is straight galaxy brain.
<comment>
Why do INFP always want to portray themselves as INFJ?
<comment>
Has a seemingly objective? moral code
Wants to influence and change the outside world to fit it
Has enough conscientiousness to write paragraphs upon paragraphs to do so
Very abstract and intuitive writing
Elaborates in a more depth-over-breadth fashion
I say INFJ, but I mean that's what everyone that comes in contact with that person says so I feel like it's almost insulting to throw my hat in the ring as well. From my perspective though I don't see anything else fitting as well, but who knows.
<comment>
he thinks humans without feeling functions exist and there are purely neutral people born with arbitrary functions because he thinks so
You're not looking at it the right way.
<comment>
Severely disordered INFJ, if he's INFJ. Smells more like a narcissist or something of that sort than a garden variety INFJ.
<comment>
Not a narcissist as far as I'm aware, but lots of mental illness involved, so in that sense, yes, not a garden variety INFJ.
<comment>
There is no true neutrality in this universe, but not from your perspective. Infant human.
<comment>
I do think Hitler is an INFJ but people really don't understand how Fi influences a persons political views.
There seems to be this prevailing thought that INFPs are leftists and sjws.
But that is simply not true.
Both the person who is a leftist activist and the person who is a rightist activist can be INFPs.
Their viewpoints and morals may differ completely but those potential INFPs are still making use of Fi.
When /pol/ has mbti threads when the expected racism occurs a lot of those participating are INFPs.
This is true for all types but it seems to be less accepted for INFPs.
<comment>
I have an ENTP friend who lost someone close and was depressed for the better part of a year. She was less snarky and slept a lot. She's since recovered and is doing fine, but now she has a quirk where she's wary when friends sleep a little more than usual and immediately considers the possibility that they might be depressed. It's actually very sweet when she does it.
That's the most I've seen an ENTP 'be introverted', and it looked nothing like INTP.
Only thing I may be addicted to is the Zeds, Zzz.
What are the chances it's because you're feeling down about things? Asking for a friend.

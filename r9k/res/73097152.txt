at library
see interesting book
guy is sitting in front of it
can't get it
walk behind him and stand awkwardly waiting for him to move
literally stand there for about five minutes
he turns around and stares at me
accidentally make eye contact
get embarrassed and turn around to walk away
bump into a random person behind me
run into a different part of the library and wait for half an hour or so
come back
he's gone
book is gone
almost cried
how retarded am i?

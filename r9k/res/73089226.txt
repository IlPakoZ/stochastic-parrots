I'm a boyfriend collector, I date as many guys as I can.
Vile.
i like collecting shiny stones i find on the floor :)
do you have a favorite, what do you like about them
We both know this is a lie and nobody wants to touch you with a 1000000000000000000 mile pole
Do you tell them you want an open relationship or do you just see more than one guy at the same time secretly?
you should date me
Could be true. Girls who do open relationships definitely exist. They're usually psychos.
The latter because most guys wouldn't accept open relationships.
Honestly I'd feel way worse if a girl asked me for an open relationship than if a girl just cheated on me in a way I didn't know about.
I would actually kill myself if I had a girlfriend ask me to open up our relationship. Would not be able to emotionally process getting that blatantly cucked.
What's your top score at once?
For online relationships, 24, but that doesn't really count since there's no challenge in keeping online boyfriends from learning about each other. Offline I peaked at six, but it didn't last very long before they found out.
We used to call that "being a whore" back in the day. Yep, those were some good times.

You can call me a whore if you want. I'd take that as a compliment. ^^
And why do you do this? Aside from it being an 'interesting' activity to do I guess.

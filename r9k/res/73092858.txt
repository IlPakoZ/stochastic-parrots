<comment>

i do believe i shall play some zelda 2 right now
such an amazing game
my crt is right next to my pc so i shall still be close by
also, i am excited to play csgo tonight
<comment>
lole i game overed on palace 2 but is not that big of a deal
also i have not played this game in like a decade the combat is very fun
<comment>
hm well i believe it is around 8 years to be precise
<comment>
ohhh i got lost an this game is much too hard for me so maze like
i simply have 1% of the motivation i used to due to the daily consistent constant unceasing abuse of me from dylan / julia / grendel michael hayden an fellow evil normalfags 
however, i can do other things that are less difficult in the meantime
<comment>
hm perhaps i will try out re4 no merchant later instead since i have never done that
altho i may pwn some noobles in tf2 soon as i wish to achieve my dream of top 100 tf2 players of all time an i am so close to achieving this dream!!!
well, at least well over halfway there
<comment>
HELLO? ARE YOU OK?
DO YOU NEED HELP?
<comment>
hm, i am gonna drink a monster nawo, also, perhaps i should shower soon, lole
it has been almost 2 weeks
also, i am quite hungry altho cannot eat until tomorrow, sigh
<comment>
ehh i should also vacuum my bedroom today sometime since i havent in a while i am just not feeling like doing much
<comment>
I DONT KNOW ITS DOING SOME KIND OF RITUAL OR SOMETHING. STOP IT JEFF
<comment>
tis will be csgo time in 52 minutes very very cool
<comment>
hopefully i make at least 1$ in drops this week, an hopefully i dont get abused in game, that would be lovely
<comment>
i am hoping my hips an butt dont get as big as my sisters it seems like they keep getting bigger an they already thick as hell but i dont want them to be too thick this sucks
<comment>
also im thinkin i will queue only office tonight cuz i love office
i havent used vc or headphones in csgo for over a month so i think i will try that out as well
<comment>
normies are also more likely to be abusive if u dont have a mic because normies dont see any humanity in text, idk why they are so sociopathic personally but tis something i have noticed
so actually using voice would make me much less likely to be abused, however i still have crippling anxiety over it, but im not feeling that bad atm an i can always dissociate or disable vc if i get abused
<comment>
also next year my hours in csgo may pass my tf2 hours, it definitely wont happen this year
<comment>
Namefagging attention starved cunt KYS
<comment>
also i rly need to practice movement on a private nuke map, i have gotten very good at bhop an ok at surf tis nice
<comment>
btw why do you tripcode?
<comment>
because the abuser above me just abused me in this fashion similar to many s4s abusers, by pretending to be me of course, i will now use this tripcode in my books to entirely negate this abusers abuse
<comment>
that makes you a tripfag attention whore
<comment>
hm, i need a lemon tea at this time, an so i am going to make one!
also my monster was delicious, however it is all drank
<comment>
im sorry i dont remember making those posts. i dont even know how i got here.. 
i truly do apologize for intrusion 
goodbye.
<comment>
please don't fall for this, because this other anon got a tripcode first you might believe it's him. It's true that I asked why you tripcoded but I did not make a tripcode myself, just look at the way that I type you can easily tell
<comment>
mmm this is delicious, i also want to try lots of new kinds of tea, similar to how i have been trying many kinds of monsters an just found my new favorite in my last book!
what a wonderful revelation, i am excited to find new teas as well! i should add them to my grocery order tomorrow most definitely
<comment>
ever since i got my own house i use speakers 99% of the time, i always forget how wonderful an immersive music is with headphones
<comment>
now is the time for csgo playing
oh yes
<comment>
i lost my first office match, i could not carry hard enough
i got a team with 4 people queuing together as a clan, they did not abuse me, probably because i was carrying
<comment>

<comment>
finally got all my xp to reduced
also i have been seeing lots of people in csgo that are from my state recently its very strange, like i have met 3 in the past few weeks, i just met one in a dust 2 game an they sounded extremely cute but i was too afraid to say anything to them....
ill probably stalk them for a while, but, im gonna go to sleep now, hopefully no nightmares this time
<comment>

I made 50% back on my bet in the lottery, tomorrow the jackpot is higher and the odds are actually better. So naturally I went all in with what I got back today. The odds of winning are even 3.5 times bigger than the last lottery. I think I have my new fav lottery to spend money on.
( before you call me an addict I only put 100 dollars on it monthly )

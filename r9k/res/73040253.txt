Hello /cut/, i'm the anon with a suicidepill gf from #59
How are you doing today?
Good
Any plans for today?
No the day is over and i'm going to bed
When was the last time you hurt yourself?
Today, technically yesterday 
Why did you hurt yourself?
I didn't, my gf cut twice around my back shoulder, I wish I could of told her to cut more on and around my back
Is there anything bothering you right now?
No not at the moment
<comment>
hello 
No not at the moment
that's very nice to hear
i'm going to bed
goodnight anon sleep well
<comment>
I just cut my penis off 3 hours ago, I am actively bleeding and I'm in shock. I don't know how I got to this point
<comment>
that's very usual, you should wrap it around in a bandage or some cloth to stop the bleeding and call an ambulance
<comment>
I'd rather bleed to death than the doctors finding out what I did to myself. I'll die while looking at this cute cat, thank you
<comment>
Hey, I don't really check these threads and only briefly experimented with cutting when I was a teenager ~10 years ago, but I saw someone who said they didn't like the old thread image and I noticed you changed it. 
That was nice of you, good job.
<comment>
I don't think that doctors care and besides that, being the dude who died because he cut his dick off seems worse 
no problem :D 
I've picked an extra wholesome one just for him
He said the previous one was making him want to hurt himself so I hope this one motivates him to stay clean 
briefly experimented with cutting when I was a teenager ~10 years ago
It's good to know you're not hurting yourself anymore, has your life gotten better since then?
I hope so
<comment>
It's good to know you're not hurting yourself anymore, has your life gotten better since then?
Unfortunately not, I'd say it's significantly worse. I still have some rather unsightly scars, but that's not why I stopped cutting. I think the main reason is just a complete and utter abject feeling of apathy. I'm not entirely sure which is worse.
<comment>
I didn't. Everything was put off until the last second like usual, and I cheated hard.
if you didn't put in the work, why does it matter that it doesn't count?
Also is it normal to want to cry but feel unable to even utter a tear?
i guess so? takes some time for me to get fed up enough to cry. or some low blows. whatever comes first. 
hey. went to before your post, so i thought i'd reply in this one. hope you stay around and chime in from time to time.
I don't want to vent about my life problems
it's fine. we all do. that's what brought us together here. doesn't have to be the only thing we do or talk about here. whatever comes to mind. 
no I actually gave the cookies to random people. My friends are very fwr away from me.
i think the point still stands. i had a customer who clearly wasn't comfortable talking to me at all. i think he had some disability. the poor guy was sweating bullets the whole time. took my time and when he was about to leave, he turned around, gave me a little chocolate bunny and wished me happy easter. it was a nice gesture and i appreciated it. i think a random act of kindness from a stranger can make a difference. 
She, they, all of them, smile and laugh when I cringe or when I'm sad and make fun of my face when I feel sad. They're my "friends" but I'm clearly the group's accessory comic relief.
that seems to be a common dynamic for friendgroups, sadly. mine did the same. we grew out of it and we were lucky our friend was able to bear with it until we did and that he doesn't resent us for it. i don't know what to tell you, because what will happen depends on what kind of people your friends will turn out to be.
Glad to hear Yuanon. Hope you had a good sleep, assuming you see this when you wake up!
thank you, prog-from-the-past. i always leave the tab open so i can read what you guys are writing. and yes. i slept well. it's just tough to convince myself to my cozy bed.
<comment>
good evening, everyone!
hello, catbro! did you have a good day?
<comment>
sorry to hear that anon 
If you want to you can discuss these sort or things with us, I don't think we'll be able to help but it might make you feel a little better 
utter abject feeling of apathy
Do you think there's a potential for you to change those feelings? do you even want to change? 
hello yuanon
<comment>
Hallo :D 
yeah it was pretty good, even though I didn't have a lot of sleep last night, I woke up not tired but with a mild headache
I ignored it and drove to uni, I had only one class today (programming), we had to program a battleships game, I knew what I was doing so it was pretty fun and while programming my headache went away which made me feel even better
So over all a 6 or 7/10 
What about you?
<comment>
hope you can catch up on that sleep over the weekend. 
I ignored it and drove to uni
attaboy!
we had to program a battleships game
that's the one with the coordinates, right? single- or multiplayer? did you get it to run?
What about you?
the day was a bit odd, i have to say. do you know those days that just feel... off? i just couldn't get into my flow today and i always felt like i was running out of time, even though i wasn't. i don't feel bad or anything, just beside myself.
<comment>
why does it matter that it doesn't count?
Because it made me extremely anxious and contributed to multiple breakdowns. And it further proves my lack of competence in anything I try. I need pain, I need to be punished, I deserve nothing
<comment>
that's the one with the coordinates, right?
yes, it's single player it's very basic since it's just text
did you get it to run?
yeah, tho it's not completely finished
hey, I just got an idea of making it in hammer editor (for games like half-life, Garry's mod)
It probably won't be too difficult to make and that way I could make it work on multiplayer 
Honestly I could make a whole arcade or a casino 
do you know those days that just feel... off? i just couldn't get into my flow today and i always felt like i was running out of time,
hah that's the first thing I thought about when you mentioned that your day was odd 
I get days like these too
I think that the best course of action is to just let it pass
<comment>
Because it made me extremely anxious and contributed to multiple breakdowns.
i guess some sort of acknowledgement of your hardships would have been nice?
And it further proves my lack of competence in anything I try.
you are tryind to excel at a lot of things all at once, don't you? gaming, drawing, languages and on top of that all the work for your educational goals. aren't you spreading yourself too thin?
I need pain, I need to be punished, I deserve nothing
you know that isn't true. you deserve some rest. 
you know, i always harp on stuff like meditation, without doing it myself. we give advice by the bucket, but take it by the grain. i'll just sit down for 15 min, close my eyes and breath for a bit. maybe i can make a habit out of that.
<comment>
Hi yu na wie gehts dir
<comment>
yeah, tho it's not completely finished
well, that's better than what i ever achieved. i took a programming class in high school. the only thing i learned was that i wasn't interested.
hey, I just got an idea of making it in hammer editor (for games like half-life, Garry's mod) It probably won't be too difficult to make and that way I could make it work on multiplayer Honestly I could make a whole arcade or a casino
tell me when it's ready. best reason for getting a pc in a while. maybe i'll get one. ^^
I think that the best course of action is to just let it pass
that's probably for the best. i'll just sit it out and look forward to tomorrow.
hey, ffmanon. hab mir schon sorgen gemacht. bei mir ist alles gut. bisschen durcheinander heute. und bei dir?
<comment>
the only thing i learned was that i wasn't interested.
just like me but the highschool I chose was IT focused and I really had no choice but to lern it 
Luckily for me my teachers back then were good at their job and managed to make their classes somewhat interesting 
I think getting into it is the worst part because you gotta learn all the building blocks that you use to build the code
tell me when it's ready.
okay but I can't promise anything
Sometimes I get these strong jolts of motivation to make something, only to then quickly burn out
i'll just sit it out and look forward to tomorrow.
yupp, on a fast day take it slow
so how are you going to sit it out, do you have any plans for today?
I personally plan of being lazy and relaxing, I was messing around on my puter a moment ago but now I'm just chilling in bed watching videos on my phone 
Actually that reminds me, I finished all of the Lord Of The Rings movies and I'm not sure what to watch next
any recommendations?
<comment>
Cutting yourself is so retarded and comes off like a teen girl attention seeking thing. I have punched myself hard enough to leave bruises before but I can't comprehend why you would do something that will give yourself scars.
<comment>
My hardships are worthless in comparison to others, so it doesn't matter.
aren't you spreading yourself too thin?
Gave up in gaming, and I'm only using education as an excuse to move (and try to meet people when I transfer schools). No motivation to try and draw lately because nothing would change about my """ art""" and I gave up learning German because it's impossible for a non-native to learn to mastery.
you know that isn't true. you deserve some rest.
It is very true for a liar and waste of resources. Someone who will never accomplish anything and should be used as punching bag for others to feel better about themselves, as I always have been.
maybe i can make a habit out of that.
You should, it seems to be very beneficial for you, which is good.
<comment>
you shouldn't generalize people like this because if anything it makes you seem like a immature teenager
The thread if called cut but it's not just about cutting and besides, I bet that most people who cut hurt themselves in other ways too 
that will give yourself scars
I feel that if somebody's desperate enough to hurt themselves getting a coupleis scars is their last concern
My hardships are worthless in comparison to others
why do you think so? 
also it's not true 
Different people experience hardships differently, you can't just objectively rate a subjective thing like suffering
Your hardships are valid kotanon
<comment>
Luckily for me my teachers back then were good at their job and managed to make their classes somewhat interesting
that was the biggest problem for me. the teachers were abysmal and focussed on the people who already knew programming going in. at some point you just check out and i got rid of it as soon as possible. 
okay but I can't promise anything Sometimes I get these strong jolts of motivation to make something, only to then quickly burn out
i have those too. i really want to build and paint armies for miniature wargames, so i can play with my friends. i get super motivated for a few days or weeks, do some work and then stop for months. i can't keep the motivation high enough to work constantly over a long period of time. so, yeah. no pressure from me. i know how that goes. 
so how are you going to sit it out, do you have any plans for today?
same as i always do. putting on some stream in the background and posting here, but i don't mind. the time i spent with you guys doesn't seem wasted to me. 
I finished all of the Lord Of The Rings movies and I'm not sure what to watch next any recommendations?
hm. do you have any favorite genres or settings? arcane is a pretty good show. check it out, if you haven't already. 
if all these things pain you so much, it's okay to put them aside for the time being or even give up on them. is there something you enjoy doing at the moment? or something you at least don't mind? 
Someone who will never accomplish anything
been there, done that. most people don't achieve anything of value. don't beat yourself up over any wasted resources. those are being wasted anyway. you being there or not. and i prefer you being here.
You should, it seems to be very beneficial for you, which is good.
thanks. i'll try to just do it whenever these threads go up. see what it does for me.

Hello everyone. The week is finally over, and I can rest. Got the work I needed to done. Going to a jazz performance tonight with a couple of my buddies, so I hope to decompress a bit there with some smooth tunes. I hope the rest of you are doing well as well.
my hardships are worthless in comparison to others
That sort of attitude truly makes things worse, I would know. That sort of cyclical thinking and overthinking can be a large contributer to mental issues. I used to feel the same way and still sort of do. However, there is no use in comparing one's own issues to others; it only brings pain to yourself. Please do take care, anon.
programming class
What coding language do you use for the class? I've only used C++ for the coding class I took last semester.
Hello to all the other regulars and visitors. Have a good stay, and thanks for coming.
<comment>
hope you have a good time with your friends and enjoy the music, prog.
<comment>
Hello prog
Hope you have lots of fun and have a nice weekend
What coding language do you use for the class?
This semester I'm learning C++
<comment>
is there something you enjoy doing at the moment? or something you at least don't mind?
There is nothing. I was playing games for a while until those started to remind me of my own issues and started making me extremely angry because games need artists and how do they manage to learn how to make anything PERFECTLY??? Yet I can't manage to make anything "basic" that looks passable or even learn "fundemental" skills and get mocked when I ask where to find a bloody mentor
most people don't achieve anything of value.
Glad to know I'm entirely worthless then. My problems are of no worth, I've decided I'm going to give up and become a hiki again, and starve myself of stimulation. It's blissfully obvious that I'm worth nothing so the world has no reason to see me
Jazz is good, go enjoy it.
That sort of cyclical thinking and overthinking can be a large contributer to mental issues
Yes, and it's impossible to get yourself out of. God knows I've tried. And after you put enough effort in without results, why bother? 
I'm going to lie in bed for however long my body wants. Maybe then my brain will work properly, but that's a pipedream.
<comment>
Yo /cut/, it's been a long time, thanks for keeping this general alive OP.
How are you doing today?
Sad and tired bros.
Any plans for today?
I had a quick beer with an old firend I hadn't seen in ages, she was with some friends so I didn't tag along for long.
Also gonna meet up with some other friend to hopefully get stoned, other than that I've slept all day.
When was the last time you hurt yourself?
I haven't cut in over a month.
Why did you hurt yourself?
Out of loneliness.
Is there anything bothering you right now?
Bros I pretty much don't know how to form or maintain relationships, I feel like I don't deserve to have friends.
<comment>
sorry i can't properly get convey what i want to say. i just don't think the ideals you chase are out there.
<comment>
Hi anon
thanks for keeping this general alive OP.
you're welcome, I wouldn't be making those if not for nice people having discussions and leaving their thoughts have (like you)
so thank you for that
Sad and tired bros.
Hope you can rest soon and at least get rid of that tiredness
I haven't cut in over a month
great work, you should be proud of yourself, keep it up :>
Out of loneliness
well it's not the same as irl contact with other people but you have us, feel free to talk about whatever you wanna or vent here, your voice won't go unheard
you're not alone
don't know how to form or maintain relationships
same so I can't give you any solid advice about that but I think what might help you is being straightforward
If you like somebody just tell them, if you're confused or don't know how to respond just say it 
I know it's easier said than done but I think doing that with make others act more straightforward towards you and you won't have to play any mind games with other people 
I feel like I don't deserve to have friends.
our brains makes us believe a lot of lies and this right here is one of them
You deserve friends anon
<comment>
Been cutting for a month, no supplies to heal anything. I have started shaving my body hair to make it easier to cut and I have well over 50 marks now.
I am very desperate for my friends to understand how bad my situation is but no one talks to me and I am getting closer to ending it all. I only weight 130lbs and plan to starve myself and hurt myself until my mind finally accepts Icneed to live or end it all
I love you
<comment>
ich wollte dir nur noch sagen, dass ich mich immer sehr freue, wenn du schreibst. bin mir gerade nicht sicher, was los ist, aber ich hoffe, dass du das auch weiterhin machst. du kannst mir immer alles erzaehlen, auch falls ich irgendwie bockmist gebaut habe, ok?
<comment>
It's okay, I'm sorry for being a brick
<comment>
cutting
eww I'm too scared to hurt a nerve and lose the usage of a finger or an hand... if I still live I don't wanna become a cripple.
I'm considering using my mother's meds to take an easy way out, she passed away 2 years ago but there's still a lot of opioids left.
My only concern is that I might survive with a crippled liver and stomach if it doesn't puts me out.
<comment>
no supplies to heal
that's pretty bad, I think you should invest in at least some bandages, if you get an infection it's will only make you and you bank account miserable
I am very desperate for my friends to understand how bad my situation is but no one talks to me
maybe they understand but are too intimidated, they don't know how to approach you about it so they'd rather leave you alone instead of potentially making you feel even worse 
to starve myself and hurt myself
I know you're not in the right headspace to see it but just know that you don't deserve it
I hope you find a way out of this one day 
easy way out,
I don't think it's that easy, isn't overdose one of the more painful ways to go?
<comment>
painful
the opioid should make me numb to all pain if I take a lower dosage in advance. I've had a heart attack in the past and I'm already familiar with that pain so even if it hurts a bit at the last moment I don't think I'd mind that much.
<comment>
I do not own a single penny and I get tired very easily. I am so exhausted just typing this on mobile.
They are angry at me because I apparently do not listen, but cannot truly understand how fucked it is. I just cannot physically understand things. I hurt them a lot and they hurt me.
<comment>
sleepy time
I'm gonna call it a night for today goodnight bros ^^ 
idk mate I think that's a bad idea
<comment>
They are angry at me because I apparently do not listen, but cannot truly understand how fucked it is. I just cannot physically understand things
you should tell them that if you haven't already
just make it clear that you're not doing well you don't mean to hurt them
<comment>
uhh, that hurting them is not your intention
sorry it's late and mt brain is melting
<comment>
some sorry dolts we are. ^^
i think i'll be on my way to dreamland as well. good night.

They think I want pity and most ignore me or have blocked me. Some think I am dead now but I do not want to talk to them, I need an escape from my 
Hell.
I am so distraught.

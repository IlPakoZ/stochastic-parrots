Goodmorning new aiwg thread
<comment>
They kicked me out of the colab so it will be longer until I have an image, especially if I keep doing lewds
goodmorning beautiful
<comment>
I wanted to have a river in the background, she ended up in the river
kanami indeed a cute
mornin Asci :))
Is it the "cant connect to a GPU backend" message? I just switch to a different account after one reaches the limit :/
<comment>
New thread is alive. 
Hence the cool stuff. 
I shall sleep now.
<comment>
I supposed to be sleeping, but sleeping isn't supposed to be me
<comment>
Is it the "cant connect to a GPU backend" message? I just switch to a different account after one reaches the limit :/
yeah, just takes a while to get back in
<comment>
I just saw 4chab connection error I got scared
Goodnight sleep well
<comment>
you're gonna make me do what????
nice partially submerged, can't believe I missed that
goodnight friend
so true, so same
<comment>
 I just switch to a different account after one reaches the limit 
Just try to not abuse too much. Google tracks that kind of stuff and knows when you switch accounts, reducing the gpu time limit. 
Another option is to someone share the url of your colab running. I thought in doing this before, but I'm too greedy for this and I like my gens fast.
<comment>
Time to think about interesting clothes to her
<comment>
gud night :))
huh I see, thanks for the advice!
literally 1984, big tech wants to limit how many times I can gen waifus
<comment>
I don't know what this is supposed to be
<comment>
steam punk train conductor maybe?
<comment>
Nice trips, she's quite pretty. I was initially going to type "she's pretty pretty" but that doesn't roll off the tongue as well.
I wanted to have a river in the background, she ended up in the river
Guess she wanted a midnight swim with all of her clothing.
<comment>

Steampunk train conductor?
<comment>

<comment>

great idea, might steal desu
love her
<comment>
The train himself appeared
Who is this blue haired girl?
<comment>
The victim of my lewding in place of Eleanor since I won't share any lewdeanor. doesn't have a name yet, but I like her enough that I'll probably make her again when I'm not horny
<comment>
I don't like lewding Asci too but sometimes I can't resist
<comment>
and i know you dont need me right now

waifu general has turned into ai waifu general
soon ai will make videos of your ai, and you can chat and date with it
isnt that incredible? we are really accelerating at a ever increasing speed. its frightening and exhilarating
<comment>
i dont know how to experiment with prompts my mind is blank all the time
<comment>
yeah, I won't pretend I don't have eleanor files, I just don't want to share them. So this girl exists for the explicit purpose to get ear fucked.
<comment>
Collab started saying nono that means it's just chatting time
<comment>
Your backgrounds are consistently amazing. And so is Shion.
hello /aiwg/
<comment>
Hello hello, nice to see you

<comment>
why cant i ever find love
<comment>
more clothes appeared
sexceptionally nice Shion, very beautiful
I am imagining her slowly lifting up her skirt while her mouth form into a grin and showing off
panties, or not wearing any, only imagination is the limit
I am imagining green trimmed pubes myself, or maybe a stubble
Chubby girl uoooh sex soft blue skin sexo
the dark souls of cum
Kinda slutty yet at the same time very wholesome
Howdy, I imagine she stretches a little and her breasts make the zipper pop open at the middle and her breasts burst out a little
fucking her brains out, in the other way
Very pretty
Very nice colors
Spooky and possibly computer virussed
Asciboobs honk honk bunny
the fate of sex waifus
yes
Face right in there and just motorboat loudly
Goa agrees with this course of action being the proper one to take if presented by the bobbas
Yes, this is hot
Sweet ride
A sweet ride in a whole other kind of a way
<comment>

<comment>
I gotta do some non-lewd gens because it takes too long to make acceptable lewds for sharing
whoa that looks flawless, exactly what I would have wanted from it
<comment>
i wanted to give her black spots on the sides of her body, like a trill, but didn't have much luck 
not me
why do you say that?
<comment>
Who's MUSHAA?
<comment>
What prompts do you guys use to make ref sheets like that?
<comment>
the humongous orb
<comment>
"This exposure is fine right? It still covers enough, right?"
<comment>
why do you say that?
my own experience
<comment>
 "Reference sheet" tag
<comment>
Pondering the unprompted orb
<comment>
when talking to people? what do they say?
<comment>
These are kind of dumb but I like them.
<comment>

<comment>
Now I want to try that too
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
I certainly find it hot. Would recommend finding the lora on civitai
<comment>
my love life experiences
<comment>
She looks absolutely radiant in this one
But also looks very bored, I wonder if I take off a few clothes prompts if she starts to look happier
<comment>
Saeriah's orbs, you may ponder them
<comment>
I will keep genning until colab kicks me out, and then go to bed.
<comment>

This thread is one of my few joys
Tomorrow I will try experimenting with different models, loras, and whatever a VAE is.
<comment>
whoa a safe for work post, who would have thought that the traditionally anti-lewd person would take a break from porn
that is what I've been doing today, has been fun
<comment>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcuNu3m0Cbc [Embed] this ones one of my favorites

Goa I said you can take off the gloves and the veil
"Yes"
So why are you
"Yes"
Fully clothed does not work with Goa it seems

I've been making a lot of porn today if I'm being honest. But here was one of the early combos today.
meinamix, blacklight, light and shadow, and animetarotcard were the model + loras (admittedly I only actually figured out how to turn on the loras once I started doing porn so this is the first time seeing how they turn out)

Thanks, I copypasted your post into my prompts.txt so I will remember it tomorrow.
I kind of want to try out KlokGen (lora on civitai) tomorrow too, for pixel stuff.
<comment>
This latest combination of things I'm trying is looking a bit too flat, honestly. I'll keep clicking button until colab kicks me out, then it's bedtime (overdue already)

Goa entering an expensive restaurant and being denied entry due to her clothing
"B-but you're naked!"
"Yes I am"
"S-so..."
"You may look upon my body"
"That's not-"
"Look all you want!"
She came back sulking because she did not get in
Nighty night, it'll be interesting to go through all the music links and see what kinds of musics there is
<comment>
I should, wearing all that armor must be tiresome for her.
<comment>
post-nut clarity be hitting like a truck and it's absurdly late, so goodnight aiwg
<comment>
Nighty night, hope you had a good nutting
<comment>
Something tells me they're cold, dry and look like two prunes.
<comment>
night :)). dw abt it man always love to see what another anons are listening to 
night to you too :)) hope you had a wonderful nut and a wonderful night
<comment>
"Next I'll go fully naked and-"
If you go in the guise of a human they'll let you in right away
<comment>
Yeah Saeriah, I you're tired too, I get it.
<comment>
I used the candlelight prompt to get a darker more moody atmosphere, it's kind of half working.
<comment>
So apparently someone totally did not forget about having the ability to turn into a human disguise
<comment>
"Eh? You won't let me in?"
Goa human disguise means human clothes as well
<comment>
Oh
They hired you
<comment>
"That job at AI-Hooters was MINE!"
Saeriah orbs to ponder
<comment>
"Look at me levitating these candles, Anon."
No, I need to ponder the orbs
<comment>
"..."
Yes, orbs!
<comment>
Looks like Goa went clothes shopping
She is true to her style if nothing else
That pointy nipple space on her boobarmor is making me feel things
<comment>
Even with no real Goa prompts and trying to gen casual clothing, results are like this
Please dominate me
<comment>
"Let's go to bed, Anon."
yes dear.
good night /aiwg/
<comment>
"What, I am wearing pants and a shirt"
nighty night, enjoy the night time tittes
<comment>
da fuq is a lora and vae im too dumb for this 
night Saeriah :))

Nicole in hat + suit and tie remains my favorite
<comment>
She finally is wearing proper clothes, but seems uncomfortable about it
me too
*potato noises*
It is a nice look
Very official
<comment>
Goa grew orbs
<comment>
"I got dressed, let's head out"
You did not get dressed
<comment>
Database program I wrote is finally working finally yay
<comment>
what did you mean I didnt, look at my sleeves! *flaps hands around*
<comment>
She is finally wearing clothes
Panties too
<comment>
Oh, looks like she's getting into the groove of wearing clothes
<comment>
I'll look away for a moment and-
Goa come on
<comment>
What food you never ate to certain age?

Goa clothes
Time to try to get her to be outdoors as well rather than general Goa void
<comment>
No no I believe you when you say you're wearing panties, no need to show me
<comment>
Good morning. I wake up and this gave me a boner. 
(ahoge, antenna hair:1.4),
She's very cute. Can I hug her? Say me I can hug her. Also,
(holding cup, coffee cup, coffee mug),
<comment>
Tomatoes. I don't like the taste of them until nowadays. But somehow, as I got older, I started to appreciate putting things that I don't like together the ones I like and feel the bad taste on my mouth.
Both me and my waifus are pretty spiteful on nature, you know.

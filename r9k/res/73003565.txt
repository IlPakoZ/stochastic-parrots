not to indian / arab / blak / asian men they are not............
These help a lot
We're talking facial features here, get out with your disgusting boobs
Round face? Slanty eyes?
so round eyes on women are unattractive? bummer. I also resemble left more, but i'm not as attractive because my face is asymmetrical and my hairline is masculine (not rounded).
For me its the ginger phenotype
nope, just less sharply angled facial bones.
I like the big cheekbone small chin combo. Small nose is nice too.

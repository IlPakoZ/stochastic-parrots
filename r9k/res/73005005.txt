Rules on how to find it impossible to get a gf 
You're probably a decent human
<comment>
It unironically is the best place to find a girl if you're not a totally disabled loser. Just innocent, young adolescent people figuring out the world.
<comment>
But anon I was only able to get a gf after graduating. 
Why was it impossible to meet girls in university?
<comment>
But if you picked STEM all of your classmates are guys. You can't just cold approach random people on the campus.

YOU can't. 
I approached random people all the time back in college.
<comment>
I didn't observe anyone doing a single cold approach in 4 years. People were still hanging out with their high school friends.
The campus had a large number of commuters and Chinese students paying 60k/year in tuition. Very few people stayed on campus after attending their lectures.

You're a psychopath if you were obsessing over people's interactions that much.

I'm a psychopath because I wanted to see if it was ok to cold approach people on campus before doing it?
<comment>
"cold approach" people everyday
the retarded kid that probably shouldn't have been accepted at uni thinks i'm hanging out with my high school friends
we all try to avoid him because he smells like shit
<comment>
Surely, I will get my first gf when I do my PhD.
<comment>
because when girls are young bubbly lively vibrant and beautiful and their love truly matters (up to 21) they only go for tall handsome men but when they are haggard ugly dull depressed cold dour bland hateful (22+) they go for guys based on cold criteria like if he has a degree, career, good income etc.

completely false but you already knew that
It doesn't matter how normalfag tier you act unironically 
Why was it impossible to meet girls in university?
You know why, grills just want to have fun. They have no real responsibility so why have a normalfag bf when they can cock carousel chads? 
I approached random people all the time back in college.
Why? Personally I think talking to women extremely uncomfortable because we all know I'm only doing the jester monkey routine to get in their pants, and girls often think I'm der untermensch tier because I'm not chad. I'm also not very interested in hearing what they have to say, I'm mostly interested in their vagina. 
You're a psychopath if you were obsessing over people's interactions that much.
Too big a jump to conclusions desu

what classes do you guys take?

you're thinking of high school faggot

college
I don't want to be Captain Demoralization here, but if you weren't at least engaged in proto-relationships (aka "going steady") in adolescence, you've missed out on years of socialization and romantic skill building and you aren't suddenly going to master it as an adult. If anything it's weirder when a twenty year old comes up to a girl fumbling over his words like a bashful twelve-year-old. It screams "Nobody liked me growing up and I failed to learn the intricate inter-social skills that extroverted women crave. I have nothing to offer you socially nor sexually, but if you reject me I might kill myself so now I've placed you into a moral dilemma. Good luck."
Your best bet would be to find equally awkward failed women at your college (try the fat ones, or the mousey geeks/weebs) and build your social skills together.

Unironically it was literally one schizo in /adv/ we all call the unifag. He shows up in every incel thread to shill for uni. 
It's not that getting a girl in uni is easy. It's that getting a girl after uni is hard. In college, most girls you meet are around your age, similar class/background, educated, and want to find partners too. Most girls in the real world are not, and you won't have even a quarter of the free time to find them. 
But it's more than that. If you haven't learned the game by twenty-fucking-three, why are you even still playing? 
The reality is that it is just hard to date, especially for men.

i want this so badly
<comment>
completely false
nope. if you hang out you'll eventually find someone pretty easily.
<comment>
I'd assume your best bet is right when you start, when you don't know anybody - and a good few women (hopefully) also don't know anybody.
I find myself incapable of talking to women unless I've just met them seconds ago - I feel like if I wait too long it'd be weird.

fratfags and other normal derivatives

I think I accidentally rejected a girl in college. She invited me to go with her to a debate between an atheist and a creationist, and I thought that was cringe as fuck so I said I had other plans. Little did I know, that was the only time a girl would talk to me in college.
Anyways college is a meme for meeting girls. I've actually met more girls working a wagie retail job after earning my useless degree. I wish I just never went to college. I could've had a normal life if I was befriending fellow wagies instead.

Just show up at every single thing at college that has college girls- parties, clubs and orgs, sports games etc. Plenty of trad girls in Christian orgs too.

You don't go to get a gf, you go to university to learn, people who think its a holiday are absolute trash
<comment>
Too many people here are of the opinion that men are the only ones that are socially stunted in some sort of way. If you and your girlfriend both started dating at the same time then you both have the same experience. Stop comparing yourself to other people. Nothing you do will ever make you similar to everybody else. Live with that and go do whatever the fuck you want.
inb4 retards espousing blackpill shit, yes there are women that are socially stunted that haven't dated well into their 20s that aren't ugly, don't move goalposts because you want to be right on the internet

U of T?
Yes kek, although I doubt it's the only school that fits that description.

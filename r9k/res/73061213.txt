Where did the stereotype that pretty girls are stupid and not into niche/nerd STEM stuff come from?
I have a friend who is really attractive (people compliment her everytime she goes out), has a thin, healthy body and at the same time majors in Applied Maths (that's crazy af for someone retarded at Math like me to comprehend). She's pretty much the opposite of what i've been told about women on the internet.
She has vast knowledge about everything: from architecture, philosophy to movies and music. She's into obscure stuff that you've probably never heard of. She is smart, witty, into 4chan memes and even built her own PC. 
What annoys me is that are women like her that rare or it's just that stereotypes (i.e. pretty nerd girls don't exist) have blinded me to the fact of life that at our cores we don't differ that much across genders?

1 outlier invalidates all other data
Also sounds like you have a crush on her. Go for it. Just remember to be confident.

But see, the problem is that incels are addicted to catastrophizing, exaggerating, and hyperbole. It's never enough for you guys to say "the women in my life are evil," you have to go a stope farther and say "all women are evil," even though anyone who's not retarded knows that must be false. If you want people to stop rubbing "outliers" in your face, stop making weak generalizations from your shitty personal experience.

From a young age on, you will be getting a lot of attention if you are attractive. That attention feels good, so you naturally keep building on activities that highlight that quality.
Instead of sitting at home alone reading books, it is more likely for you to join that dancing or cheerleading group at school. 
You get your social proof easily and feel validation by doing social activities. You do not need to spend time reading books or studying to feel smart and get your validation that way. Learning about math is difficult, it is much easier to just go out and focus on doing the things that come naturally to you.

hey guys check out this totally real thing that happened to me and not you, or anybody you know!
it's the exception that proves that the rule is untrue

Really? I study mathematics and there are like 6 girls to 100+ guys over here. The ratio is even worse in applied mathematics. Don't even get me started in theiretical mathematics, i don't think a woman entered that course in more than a decade lol

Pretty girls are usually into sick shit like bdsm and dog fucking.

inb4 anon falls in love with her and starts complaining about how she only fucks assholes who dont share her interests
i dunno. i can't really judge since i was hard headed once too but its frustrating when youngfags feel the need to reinvent the wheel or step out of the beaten path thinking they somehow cracked the code.
to answer your question however, the stereotype stems from pretty girls almost always being zombies for social validation and having almost no personality beyond makeup and gossip simply because thats all they needed in life so far.

You're not learning mathematics in high school

The idea women are irrational is a millennia-old stereotype propped up by patriarchy

Where did the stereotype that pretty girls are stupid and not into niche/nerd STEM stuff come from?
from guys who are into niche/nerd STEM stuff reporting that there are next to zero girls interested in their stuff and if there are they are:
chink
troon
fat
and/or lumberjack lesbian

"You guys lied to me, pretty women arent stupid", *literally 4seconds of reading later*, "i wish she wasnt an expection tho".

I work with a gigabimbo with a PhD that regularly publishes research in medical journals on beauty products. Sometimes she even gets minor media attention. She regularly goes to work dressed like most girls do when they're clubbing, and she dresses even sluttier on her nights out she still has had the same bf for the entire time I knew her. She's made acting like an airheaded bimbo her thing since she realized most dumbfuck men are easily manipulated by that. She is the kind of gigastacy that makes other girls seethe by her existence alone.

i kinda cant even be mad about women like that. like, when shes dealt a good hand and plays it well.

I am glad some of you think this way, you are right. I've met tons of women who are pretty and far smarter than me. It is humbling to accept this but is ultimately a good thing.

I don't think anyone is denying that there are exceptions. For what it's worth it's probable you will never meet another girl like that for the rest of your life, so I recommend marrying her while you can. That said, I would guess she's better at consuming and regurgitating data than she is at creating original thought. If you engage her in, for example, philosophical conversations without a basis in the works of existing philosophers I would guess she suddenly loses all competency. That's true of most men too, to be fair. But at least I have never met a woman good at that sort of thing.

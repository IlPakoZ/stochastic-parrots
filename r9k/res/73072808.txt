My /r9k/ trans gf says the answer is 999 but I think it's 564. Can any mathnons help us out here?

LOL
LMAO

Shut up retard-san, nobody cares.

Please help us she's been really angry about this and burst into tears. I love her so much and I need a mathanon to save us PLEASE!
<comment>
Ask chatGPT to give you the answer
<comment>
Wish I was smart :( 
Is adderal my only chance
<comment>
there are none btw if anyone actually actually cares.

3 is one of the 564 possibilites where it's an integer dumbass.
1/(2*floor(sqrt(1)+1) = 1/3
1/(2*floor(sqrt(2)+1) = 1/3
1/(2*floor(sqrt(3)+1) = 1/3
1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1 is an integer
<comment>
Here's another one of them.
<comment>
squrt(1) floor is 1
sqrt(2) floor is 1
sqrt(3) floor is 1
sqrt(4) floor is 2
therefore 1/(2*1+1) => 1/3 until n = 4
1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 is the first integer at n = 3
sqrt(n) floor after n = 3 is 2 until n = 9 
1/(2*2+1) => 1/5 
1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 is the next integer at n = 8
if u do more work u will find the next integer at n = 15 (see what the pattern is??? just before perfect square 4*4 there exist 3 integers) 
Therefore all you need to do is sqrt(1000000)-1 to get the answer which is 999
I tried explaining how simple it is to him but he keeps saying "no you are wrong I did it in python"
<comment>
also he has no justification for his answer other than that he did it in python, I did mine in c++ and got my answer that I justified here(999). I told him that python can be bad for stuff where you add a million small numbers, but he keeps insisting that I'm wrong and he's right(btw he's lying when he says I am crying, I am actually quite calm and he's a bit upset over this ordeal)
<comment>
i thought the floor was brackets.
<comment>
I'm sorry. You're right. I'm stupid and you should sit on my face with a diaper as punishment for me.
It explains it in the image. Brackets in path are like big parenthesis and it doesn't make sense there.
<comment>
It's okay, I forgive you, even though you were being really upset over this whole ordeal. But from now on I shall be known as "smart-sama" on this board. I think it's only just after all the insults I receive.
<comment>
It looks right. It is prob is. Although, I've taken a short glance at it and have not actually looked at it with much effort. It just emulates a series-type problem quite well.
<comment>
bumping this thread so it doesn't disappear while i solve it-- almost done i figured out the insight of the proof give me a few mins. haven't looked at any other responses will do after my proof is completed.
<comment>
it is taking me longer to formalize the proof, but essentially the proof strategy is:
let A = [2*floor(sqrt(n)) + 1]
realize that 1/A is generated in the sequence (and therefore summed) exactly A times before A is incremented to the next value via the floor operation. so basically there is 1 integer valued sum for every integer raised to its own power prior to 1000000. so the number should be 1000 I think, because sqrt(1,000,000) is 1000. maybe 999 like your trans gf said because of off by one, haven't gotten there yet.
<comment>
oh duh n is less than, not including 1000000. so your trans gf is right. still working on a formalization.
<comment>
Isn't this just asking how many square numbers are between 1 and 1,000,000? Because at every square number you'll reach a whole fraction. Such as 3/3, 5/5, 7/7, 9/9...
There are 999 square roots under 1 million so your bf is correct.
<comment>
ok, attached is the proof that there is an integer value of this summation for every perfect square. essentially when n=(m-1) where m is a perfect square m=(4, 9, 16, 25,...) and thus n=(3, 8, 15, 24,...) then the sum is an integer value.
this proceeds via a (sloppily formatted...) proof via induction.
next i need a formalization that there are no n between each of the earlier listed values that yields an integer value, but this proof already establishes that there are AT LEAST 999 integer values for all n between 1 and 1000000.
999 IS the correct answer, but i'm probably not going to formalize this next part because it's 2am and i'm tired.
thanks for posting a fun problem! is this a putnam problem? i took it this past december, ended up getting a fucking 1/120. hopefully will do better this year.
<comment>
you retards need to stop coding to solve problems like these. you clearly aren't supposed to brute force it. learn to do proofs, look what i did here: >>73074462
you will become much better at programming if you have a rigorous understanding of the mathematical formalism that serves at the foundation of computer science.
yes, see my (incomplete but basically finished) proof
<comment>
also before i go to bed, quick proof strategy for proving that the n = (m-1) where m is a perfect square are the only values that cause the sum to be an integer:
construct a set, say B where B is simply every positive integer n that Sn is an integer value.
then for all natural numbers x, [(x+1)^2]-1 is a member of B since we have already proven that A is the set of all natural numbers.
so then construct any integer k such that [x^2]-1 &lt;= k &lt; [(x+1)^2]-1. from here you can simply construct another break apart of the corresponding Sk where Sk = m + [corresponding sum terminating at k], and show that the corresponding sum is NOT an integer value, meaning that Sk cannot be an integer value.
then for the bow on top you'd just show that if you take the subset of B with every member less than 1000000, that the subset in question has 999 members. simple when you equate the earlier expression of an arbitrary member of B in terms of X with the max value of 999999, relating it to the earlier A.
<comment>
It's a 4chan post.
I am doing homework.
Some things really don't need a proof explanation. 
You can definitely throw out proofs for every single question under the sun. 
But you don't. Because you really don't have to. 
It took you far longer to formalize a proof when brute forcing revealed a pattern in less than 5 minutes for most.
I agree that when it comes to most higher-level mathematics, proofs becomes much more crucial and important. But this is literally a series problem. Sperging over this is nonsensical.
<comment>
He challenged me to solve it earlier smug that he had the correct answer, I was going to find it analytically but he insisted that he "found" the """correct answer""" using python (he got 564), so I found the correct answer by coding (999). I only justified my answer shortly afterwards using this logic here >>73072926 but he kept insisting I was wrong for some reason and he kept getting frustrated over it(basically the opposite of what he claims, I never got upset or cried over it).
Also it surprised me because I'm majoring in CS and he is in math....(well statistics but same thing) so if anything the roles should be reversed
also he posting on sci >>>>/sci/15389300 and posted here when he got no replies

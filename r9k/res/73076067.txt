There is no point of living if you're disabled and unhealthy. You can't do or be anything even if you wanted to. You just simply exist, receiving pity applauses and being a burden to those around you. You're useless to yourself and to society. So even being alone, life is still worth living as long as you're not disabled and healthy.

There's always lower to fall is what I realized, like there's being disabled and then there's being me, the truth isn't in words, the truth is in the shadow.

Pretty sure if Jesus came back to earth, he would come as a tard.
Think about it. He could shit himself any time he wanted.

Why is that? Are you disabled in any kind of way?

You could have just stopped there but you had to go on

When you live in a certain "zone" of life, everything below it seems way harder, but you learn to accept where you are in your current zone. When you're stuck in a hospital bed, you live within your means. When you lose your legs in an accident and have to be in a wheelchair, you live within those means. You can still contribute in specific ways to the world, as long as your brain still functions properly.
My only real fear is losing my vision and hearing. If I was missing even one of those I feel like all enjoyment of life would cease to exist.

If you're healthy and non-disabled and still kill yourself then you're just a pussy. All those motivational "you can do anything if you set your mind to" only apply to non-disabled people, especially if they're young. Mental disabilities are bad but sometimes even they can find ways to manage more than a physically disabled person. Likely you're just an ungrateful naive pessimist.

The worst hellish existence would be to have no limbs, blind, deaf, and mute. This is a prime example of a pointless existence. In the wild, animals die if they sprain an ankle but in society people have a twisted obligation to keep you alive even if you're suffering. There are simply some worse things than death where the possibility of change is slim to none. The only reason many people don't kill themselves is because they fear eternal torment, just more suffering in existing, otherwise suicides would happen much more often.

Neither can I. At least he can sit home and watch movies and read books and not have to work.

it feels like theres too many systems in place that are meant to trap those with no self control, and to degrade and allure people who are still sane. why does it feel like the worlds wants to float the lucky and greedy few on the brine of broken saps. and those few still a slave to masochistic machines. and all i can do is parrot the same realization everyone has at at 13 years old

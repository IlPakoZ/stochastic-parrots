If they are a terf, yes, if theyre not, no. You would still have to uphold the feminist part of the terf acronym btw

i used to be okay with transexuals
but it really is just a mental disease :(
one needs to accept that oneself is oneself
its a deep problem if one can not be okay with oneself
and have to change something
"i dont like myself" is not a healthy thought
so no, treat it for what it is
a symptom of a mental health problem

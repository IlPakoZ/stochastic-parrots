Would women find it attractive if I told them I was a TERF?
you mean TURD right?
i believe the correct phrasing is FART
No, I mean TERF.
No I think you mean poopoopeepee
If they are a terf, yes, if theyre not, no. You would still have to uphold the feminist part of the terf acronym btw
"Oh, I like to be in the cage, my Lady. It's the right place for a man."
no because real terfs recognize men cannot be feminists
i used to be okay with transexuals
but it really is just a mental disease :(
one needs to accept that oneself is oneself
its a deep problem if one can not be okay with oneself
and have to change something
"i dont like myself" is not a healthy thought
so no, treat it for what it is
a symptom of a mental health problem
it's a mental disorder that has only been shown to be alleviated with the administering of cross sex hormones.

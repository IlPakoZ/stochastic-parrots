I'M JUST MADE OF BILLIONS OF CELLS AND I'M DEAD MATTER THAT IS SENTIENT OF IT'S OWN EXISTENCE
NOBODY WILL REMEMBER YOU FOR EVER
WE WERE BORN TOO EARLY TO EVER EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS AND JOYS OF LATE HUMANITY
YOU IGNORE THREAD BECAUSE WE'RE HARD WIRED TO IGNORE THE TRUTH OF MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE
The truth is Jesus.

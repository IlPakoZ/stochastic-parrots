How can you really escape porn, when you are a neet ? Let me guess : Stop being a neet.
BUT HOW ?

how do you get addicted to porn?
do you seriously just jack off all day to people degrading themselves for money? 
how about having a little self control and not jacking it every time you feel bored or see something mildly lewd

when you have bad feelings in head and can't get rid of them you must do extreme things to get rid of them. Watching porn and jerking off makes the depression go away clearing up your head of all the bad suicidal thoughts. The suicidal thoughts come back. Rinse and repeat

it's not that easy, beside the real wall that is the " withdrawal phase " that hit really hard for hard porn addict, there is just the habit of over a decade of daily porn addiction.
Every time i cum on the floor, i look at my man juice and i think " it was the last time, i will never go back " and then i proceed to delet again all my porn, knowing the next day i will get hard at the first sight of tits i will see, with regret of all my deleted porn.
Im just tired to fight agains't it, but can't commit to become a full porn addict pride of his misery.

That exactly how i feel, except that i do not get as much suicidal thoughts than most of people, last week i tried again nofap, i lasted a week, in the end i was so deep into depression that i gave up, i felt really bad, when i think about it now, i realise it was like i was possessed by a demon or something, like if the devil send his best man to make me fail.

You want porn because you need dopamine. Start doing some things, besides jerking off that you truly enjoy. There is nothing wrong with using porn to get dopamine, but it shouldn't be your only source.
Also don't be too hard on yourself when you relapse, some people have trouble quitting things cold turkey.

Fembots, what is your opinion on trannies?
<comment>
Cute tranny, mind if I hunt down her socials and ejaculate inside her?
<comment>
I only mind non passing trans females when they try to say they're lesbians. No, faggot, you're a straight perverted man
<comment>
Theyre mentally ill and I dont believe in switching genders. I wouldnt treat them badly, but I still think they are mentally ill
<comment>
I'm not saying I hate them, but if they were systematically hunted down like animals and eradicated I'd be cool with it.
<comment>
MtF: I wouldn't date one but if otherwise I'll treat them like any other moid, if they keep themselves and their cock well away from me we won't have a problem
FtM: just kinda feel sorry for them
<comment>
Fembots are frumpy losers and it bothers them on a visceral level to see men doing a better job at being women than them so they typically have very anti-trans attitudes.

Imagine being less desired by a man taking female hormones. 
Fembots truly suffer worse than robots.

Kind nerdy trans girls who try hard to be feminine even if they aren't are angels and I love them
The rest are the most revolting humans on the planet
Don't care about ftms

i have heard ftm pussy is chef's kiss and that they turn into super subby sluts when they are horny
<comment>

All I know is that if another tranny tries to match with me on a dating app like they're a real woman, I'm going to log on to Minecraft and commit a hate crime there.
You are not a woman. You are an ugly dude in a dress. Fucking you would be gay. Period. End of story.

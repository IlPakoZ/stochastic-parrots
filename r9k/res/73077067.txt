We've humanized the females. Our biggest mistake. We got too attached to what we created 
You probably don't remember since you are V.917 males and this all happened in V.001 
They were meant to relieve us of our curse. The unholy desires that we were cursed with because of our treachery and disobedience
Males would seize other males and do the unspeakable with them. This led to disease, confusion and suffering 
So we created the "female". A nice little creature that we developed under the codename "Phallus Sleeve"
They were meant to relieve us and keep as sane enough to build and mold. They don't have souls like us
They look similar to us, as we designed them as humanoids, but they are not truly human as we are 
Around V.133 we got tired of using artificial w.o.o.ms and decided to make it so they'd be able to reproduce with us
This was our second biggest mistake. Since we gave them the ability to carry a child and give birth they began thinking too highly of themselves
Did they forget that our seed is what creates that life? Without our seed the eggs that we created within them would be useless
Overtime, males genetics have changed to emotionally "bond" with these females. Thinking of them as co-creators and as peers
Do not be deceived. We created them to relieve us of our curse
That is their purpose.

This is how I unironically believe the Garden of Eden and Creation itself started

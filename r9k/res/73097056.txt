bored as fuck in the chem lab
decide to do some trolling with bleach and vinegar meme
mix 30 oz of bleach with 25 oz of vinegar for the lol
the mix start slizzing and people can smell the fume
everyone starts coughing and choking
oh shit
pour the entire thing into the sink but somehow the smell is even more terrible
at this point everyone runs outside and vomits, some near me have their skins turned red
chaos ensues and the fire dept was called
teacher probably knows what's going on but she gaslights the principal that's just some outdated chem. no one punishes me for comitting geneva war crime.

Boobs vs. Ass, we have all heard it.
A fat ass can compensate for small tits, but not vice versa. Also, a girl's cup size is out of her control, while you can get a bigger ass by going to the gym. Ass vs. tits is the girl equivalent of height vs. muscle. We don't like it when a girl goes "6+ft only" since we don't get to pick our height. However, it's acceptable for a girl to go "i like muscle" since we actually can accomplish that by working out. Similarly, it would be more fair to judge based on ass than tits, since it's something that's in their control.

You make a fair point, Anon. From an objective standpoint, I suppose ass would be the superior thing to lust for, but I still prefer booba.
At the end of the day, I wouldn't pick a woman solely for the things, so I guess it doesn't matter all too much.

I prefer tummy.
A nice midriff really gets me going. It's a general indicator of fitness and something that can be self-improved, so my conscience is clean.

I prefer booba because I prefer face, and because I can enjoy looking at booba and face simultaneously. The size of the booba does not matter, all that matters is that they are beneath a pretty face.

Oromos are ethnically and nationally ethiopians and they are most similar, genetically to somalis, that if you saw one in person you'd think they were somali.
They are the largest Ethiopian ethnic group and the largest overall ethnic group in Ethiopia.
My question is why are somalis hated when they look like the bulk of ethiopians? It can't just be because of religion, as there are Nigerian, Ghanian and Malian Muslim Africans.
Oromos also have big foreheads like us and they are as dark as us. They have similar teeth and eyes as us. 
Is it really the culture? because from the ethiopians I've come across they have the same sense of ethnic superiority over other sub-saharan africans, that somalis do

why are somalis
Their diaspora.

You seem to be under the mistaken impression that white people like Ethiopians. We don't.
We perhaps find Ethiopians a little comical, because of the Starvin' Marvin type stereotype. And that little bit of humor may be what you are perceiving.
<comment>
we white people do like and respect ethiopians.
never conquered
christians
fantastic jazz
very good iconography and jewelry
not my fault if you are ignorant white trash

wtf are you talking about Nigerian are the most hated even within africa.
I'll resume something about us white people regarding muslims
be muslim
non sufi = disliked by white people
sufi = liked and respected by white people
<comment>
That's funny because within Islam, Sufi's are seen as heretical unless they give up some of their mystical or 'innovative' practices.
It's interesting that white people like Sufis and Shias when they are minorities and hated by basically all other Muslims.
wtf are you talking about Nigerian are the most hated even within africa.
Idk that. In the city where I live they love west africans and that includes Nigerians.
<comment>
everybody hates nigerian because they are liars and rude apparently. I think in europe East africans are way more liked and fetishized than Westerners. East africans are regarded as oriental and abrahamic while west africans are voodoos uneducated french speaking wide nosed rabble. 
what city do you live in anon? and why don't you become Tawahedo?

I mean I can barely tell the difference if you lined up 10 swedes and 10 norweigans. You think I'm going to waste time examining every African phenotype like some 20th century ethnographer?
<comment>

Saint Paul, mn

I'm fine with Islam. Although, in my opinion the best Christians are Orthodox like Ethiopians and Eastern Europeans
because they don't elevate the Virgin Mary or they don't believe in the OSAS (once saved always saved) thing that Protestants believe.
<comment>
it's okay that you have your cute little opinions about christianity as a muslim but God is a catholic.
Orthodox is fine enough but theologically we catholics have always held the truth. I'm sorry you live in america, it must be awful as a somali muslim. Also please don't disrespect the Mother of God
<comment>
I wasn't disrespecting Mary. Well I guess it could be considered disrespect from your religion.
We consider it disrespectful to consider Jesus God or the son of God. We also consider it disrespectful to venerate or worship Mary.
To each his own I guess.
<comment>
christians
Ethiopians are only 62% Christian, the original Christian communities are only 42%, while the rest are converts by Europeans over bread.
And no most Muslims in Ethiopia are not Zoomalias/Ogaden, they mostly Oromos/Amhara/Gurages/Hararis.
<comment>
you weren't disrespecting Mary I just wanted to ask you not to do it in further comments. In any case you can't consider our faith disrespectful. why would it be disrespectful to do our own thing? I don't get why you muslims always want to cut the omnipotence of God. as an omnipotent God he can have a Son, a Mother and a Grand Mother if he wanted to. He chose to incarnate as a human to save us yet every muslim i talk to tries to say to me that it is not possible. God is literally omnipotent. a muslim girl once told me God wouldnt need to do that. it doesnt make sense, He didnt need to create the world either yet here we are. why can't you see the beauty and love in God's complex acts? and why don't you recognise fulfilled prophecies in our sacred history?
<comment>
We remember the 20th century. this is what Ethiopia means to us, no matter what happened next.
<comment>

Oromos do not look like Zoomalis, the only Oromos that looks Zoomalis are Pagan Boranas, from bantu land called Kenya.
You Zomalis are the most Bantu influenced Horn Africans from looks to culture (see Niiko). that is why you are hated and no Horner want to associate with you. but you keep insisting. stop claiming Harar/Adal history.
Sufi's are seen as heretical
No, they are not. maybe to Saudi sandboons with no backbone, think that. In Africa 99.9% of Muslims (at least where am from) are all Sunnis, Sufis are consider to be part of greater sunni.
<comment>

I'm not well versed in this topic in theology but the mainstream Sunni view is God is perfect and needing a son or partner would diminish his perfection.
Also, if God had a father or mother than he isn't the first God or "true" God.
He chose to incarnate as a human to save us
and why don't you recognise fulfilled prophecies in our sacred history?
We don't believe in the Christian view of the Messiah being the son of God that had to be sacrificed for the sin of humanity that is described in Isiah 53.
It's not only us either, Jews have the same Bible as you (without the NT) and they don't believe in Original Sin or the Messiah having to be sacrificed.
We also believe the Bible have been changed and distorted.

Fun face haile shitlassie was not supposed to be the king, originally it was Lij Iyasu was set up to be a king, but he was suspected to be Muslim (he is from Muslim parent's that were forced to orthodogxy). Most people in shewa today, especially menz, yifat area used to be Muslim before being force converted to Christianity. 
Ethiopia was a feudal shithole for much of its history, it only abolished slaver in the 1950s or even later, thanks to backward orthodogs fascist rule. It's not a flex to have orthodog genocidal slave state
<comment>
Sufis are consider to be part of greater sunni.
They are subgroup or subset of Sunni yes, but a lot of their Sufi practices are considered innovations from the Orthodox/Mainstream Sunni position
You Zomalis are the most Bantu influenced Horn Africans from looks to culture (see Niiko). that is why you are hated
What are you then? Oromo or Amhara?
<comment>
It's because of the Somali diaspora culture but it's not only somalis 
but also other Africans that try to imitate nigger culture
And no most Muslims in Ethiopia are not Zoomalias/Ogaden
There are less somalis and Ogadeni somalis because you motherfuckers took our land
The Ogaden belong to Somalia, Negro

muslims are literally subhuman

That is propaganda by Saudi sandn!ggers with no backbone, they claim orthodoxy, while sanctioning Halloween as a celebration to show their over lords that they are not bad

needing a son or partner
nobody said anything about 'needs' i adressed it in my coment, your error is assuming there is a need involved.
Also, if God had a father or mother than he isn't the first God or "true" God.
closed minded ultra simplistic view. Mother of God is an epiteth regarding the fact that Mary birthed Jesus. and it's also a spiritual title.
We also believe the Bible have been changed and distorted.
you sure like to believe random shit. i can assure you that is a scientifical fact that the bible was not distorted. it was proved when we found the Dead Sea Scrolls and there wasnt discrepancies with the versions we use. Also, muslims, jews and protestants literally worship books. We catholics have the Church that Jesus founded and promised to take care of and comunicate through. you shouldn't even talk about the Bible since is not your religion's business i dont know why you guys even talk about the Bible. And for last you have a very simplistic view of sin and the original sin. God chose to perform a prophetic act like some of the prohets were comanded to do in the OT to make us now that we didnt need to make sacrifices anymore and by just accepting His own sacrifice we would be saved. Christianity is the only abrahamic religion that fulfills the promises and closes the circle all other abrahamic religions are incomplete.

Kys OP you retard. Mods should ban this thread.

Okay so let's say that God decided to have a son, it would diminish his perfection.
 you shouldn't even talk about the Bible since is not your religion's business i dont know why you guys even talk about the Bible.
We talk about the Bible because we are an Abrahamic faith and our claim, as Muslims, is that Prophet Muhammed (SAW) is the final prophet and is descended from Abraham (as).
We also have a lot of the same Prophets.
simplistic view of sin and the original sin.
Our view of sin is more well defined than both Christians and Jews. But you may be right about Original Sin since I don't know much about that since it's only 
a Christian doctrine. 
we didnt need to make sacrifices anymore 
Scapegoat sacrifice Second Temple period Jewish view and even in those times all you needed to do to be forgiven was to repent. Even Jews now view that all you have to do is repent.
The scapegoat was used for the whole nation or something. The son doesn't not bear the sin of the father and future generations do not bare the sin of past generations.

The Somalis are more associated with terrorisim acts such as modern sea piracy. It could be argued that starting point was the black hawk down incident where the Somali factions dragged the bodies of the United States force https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_Down_(book).

What are the odds akhi? I hope you had a great day.
why the fuck is this garbage on /r9k/
I know right. What we need is more femanon/fembot threads and threads about faggots or sex.

diaspora retards from backwards medieval shitholes are way more likely to grow up as socially inept losers and end up on here

True but why do their being their retarded backwater tribal politics to fucking /r9k/ of all places. Go to your own forums and discuss the intricacies of nigger race 1's superiority over nigger race 2.

That's not true tho, they were conquered by Italians in the 1930s iirc.

God decided to have a son, it would diminish his perfection.
this is a very arbitrary conclution but ok. So why didnt the decision to create the world diminish his perfection? specially a world where evil exists. why, then the fact that He created demons and jinns and angels and humans that are not perfect didnt diminish His perfection acording to you?
about the other stuff i prefer not to respond since it's just the same old back and forth dogma defending on both our ends
<comment>
Because all of those are creations and they separate from God. Honestly, trying to imagine God having some sort of son would require a series of other philosophical thoughts and questions. Would he need to create a "deity" similar to him but also limited that could bare his son? Would he need to create a creation that would be able to contain the power of God in its womb? etc etc. I'm going to stop right here because all of this is bordering on blasphemy in my religion.
You wouldn't be able to make a thread like this on /int/. For some reason they are very rigid with what you can post about.
Sure some faggots can have generals with coombait but God forbid anyone wants to talk about different ethnic groups.
I've tried /pol/ before, but again, they're rigid with what you can post and it's a RACIST ASS white nationalist board 
so why the fuck would I post about African ethnic groups there to begin with?

i went to go fish on lake minnetonka and tried my hand at landing the biggest crappie event they had hosted there. then bought some new motorcycle tires for the season once they sweep the roads this upcoming week. going to finish installing the brand new motorcycle fairings i got. gunmetal grey with cyber red accents.

gonna and try to make it look like this
<comment>
These are so cool. I always wanted a motorcycle as a kid, but seeing that 7-8 months of the year are cold here and cause of the cost, I gave up wanting to buy one.
<comment>
you have confirmed a thought that I already had from previous talks about religion with other muslims, and i thank you for your time since it was interesting. that thought is you guys are stuck with the idea of "need". whenever a muslim talks about the son of God they mention the need "he wouldnt need" "there's no need to", etc. idk if its something to are taught or is in your theology but that is why you dont understand it. it has nothing to do with needs. He doesnt need to, yet He did. 
You are limiting His omnipotence by negating something extraordinary He did for us by considering it paradoxical and not necessary.

do what i did and nab a nice deal at an insurance auction. i got a motorcycle for $500 and then i fixed up the sub frame damage and redid the wiring and headlights. its a cbr650r. I love the thing so much bros. its my baby. just get basic insurance for $15 a month and your set. I could sell this baby for what its worth which is 8-9k right now, after i asked a used motorcycle dealership how much my salvage title honda cbr650r was worth. 
Think outside the box ahki, you can do it.

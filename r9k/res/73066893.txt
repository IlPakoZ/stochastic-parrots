I feel like I can only ever be friends with women or other feminine guys because I am scared of men.

And I am scared of women so I only feel like I can be friends with men

yeah, I don't really like most other men, especially normie men
have this one normie who hangs out on Fridays who is always so fucking loud and obnoxious, and worst of all, completely oblivious
he acts so differently around women that it makes me extremely uncomfortable

Ok I am scared of attractive women but it helps when you talk to them on discord so you can't see them.
Women are quiet and I hate how loud men are. They're also more active but I prefer talking and chilling.

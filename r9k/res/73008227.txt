Let's say I, hypothetically, made over $12k a month, what type/kind/level of fembot could I afford with that?
Assuming I'd expect her to at least provide me with sexual favours, make food and take care of the house in general, and hang out and cuddle when we watch movies or whatever

It's 2023. Any woman with value already makes her own money and isn't swayed by your money unless you're turbo rich or it's a job that also comes with status. The only women you'll get purely through moneymaxxing and gutter trash whores who belong to the streets. Improve personality and looks, OP.

Depends, how much money is that?
Haven't thought of how much I'd give as an allowance, though I'm assuming I'm probably not going to be spending more than 3 to 5k a month, so it probably depends on the girl too.
Maybe I should look into those russian wives selling sites, but I'm expecting over half of them are scams.

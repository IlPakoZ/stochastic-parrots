something I've realized about myself is that "cozy" or "comfy" things make me mildly horny. I guess I shouldn't feel too guilty about it, and it makes sense to me - lots of people are turned on by feeling safe or protected or comfortable or whatever. but I've never heard anyone else describe it in these sorts of terms or relate being "comfy" with being easily aroused at all. the weirdest manifestation of this is one time I came just from masturbating to a picture of a really fucking cozy tiny home. that was it, nobody was in the home or anything, it was just really fucking idyllic. I lost the picture ages ago while moving hard drives, breaks my heart. 
pic related, this RV is kinda in the ballpark of what im talking about. imagine getting hot and heavy with someone you like and trust in a small cozy space.

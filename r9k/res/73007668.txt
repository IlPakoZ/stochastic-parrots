Fuck this shit.
Each year of my life is worse than the last.
I should have finished myself last year.
I'm basically living to meet the expectations of others more and more.
I can't even do the one thing I like without being anxious anymore.
I got tired, I decided that until I have the courage for the rope I'm going to give up all my leisure.
I'm just going to work harder and harder while doing what others say until there's an opportunity for a different path or I have the courage to an hero'd.
Or maybe I fail like any long-term challenge which I've set for myself, I probably have ADHD too, i've been screwed by the same problems every day for years and yet i proctastinate any attempts to get rid of them, saying i'll do it the next day and things will get better.
Someone here once said:
There's no cope
There's no hope
There's only the rope
I may not have the courage to kms yet, but part of me dies today.
That's all, fuck this board too. I liked to make an effort to respond to good posts but I realized that a fish cannot change the current of the tide.

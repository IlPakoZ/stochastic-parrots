why dont you own a scooter?
because i don't have a thousand dollars
Because I'm autistic and never leave the house. Even if I did, I don't live in a quaint Japanese village, but rather in Burgerland where riding a scooter around would result in me being killed instantly by either the bumper of Cletus Trucknutz or the bullet of Nog Gibsmedat.
The only decent connection to where I live is via the motor way. So it wouldn't really be worthwhile for me.
i bought a cub after watching that anime 
but i dont live in japan so everyone just gets angry at how slow it is
I have a car.
i own a moped
Gas is to expensive and bad for climate and hard to repair when it's broken, bicycle rides on my excess fat and can be repaired by any retarded monkey
seems like a you problem

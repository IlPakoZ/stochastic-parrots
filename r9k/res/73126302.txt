Because I'm autistic and never leave the house. Even if I did, I don't live in a quaint Japanese village, but rather in Burgerland where riding a scooter around would result in me being killed instantly by either the bumper of Cletus Trucknutz or the bullet of Nog Gibsmedat.

The only decent connection to where I live is via the motor way. So it wouldn't really be worthwhile for me.

I don't have a future or attainable dreams. But I cannot get over this fact. I have been aware of this for the past 7 years and it still drives me up the wall. I know some people can just resign to playing video games, but I absolutely cannot do that.
just get really good at staring into deep space and experience enlightenment
You're ahead of the curve then. Most people just lie to themselves their entire lives and die as happy idiots and retards
I don't think so, why would I want to be miserable?

what's your life like outside of dating?
Nonexistent. I wake up and get ready for work, then work a job where I pretend to be busy for 8 hours, then come home and I'm too tired to do anything but dick around at home and maybe play some games. I want to find something to do after work but it's hard to figure out what'd be fun or add purpose to my life.
are you happy?
No, but I'm not really unhappy. I just am.
neet/wageslave/career status
Wageslave, I'm a temp worker in a hospital's accounting department but they hired me without actually having much work for me to do so I'm not doing anything and not progressing in my career aspects, just getting paid to pretend to look busy
how ugly and or short are you?
6-7/10 face, but I'm 5'4 so I haven't had too much luck with women. General experience talking to women online is they're interested in me until they find out how tall I am, then find an excuse to ghost me
do you think you'll die single?
Maybe, maybe not. Hard to tell. Leaning towards being single forever, I'm starting to even get scared of the prospect of actually being in a relationship at this point

what's the closest you've been to having a girl like you
In high school a chick was into me and we spent months getting pretty close to each other. I took her to prom after being goaded by my friends and her friends trying to hook us up. She dragged me to an afterparty, got drunk, and made out with some random dude there. The next day when I confronted her she called me stupid for falling for her then never talked to me again.

How do you reconcile that you have called me an incel but I had sex a long time ago
<comment>
Have you considered SEAmaxxing?
In most situations I don't care about the difference between insin (involuntarily single) and incel since they basically always come together. In your case, I don't care that much if you can have sex if you can't have a bf. I don't know how you had sex in the past, also, but depending on that happened, I could maybe call you an insin but not an incel, but idk if that's true given what you were saying about grindr in that /lgbt/ thread the other day.

Do you have any screencaps of previous conversations? What exactly goes wrong?
I personally used to be extremely anxious even when just talking 1-on-1 even with random guys to try to be friends on discord, but especially with girls, but with enough attempts you're bound to get better. If you're SEAmaxxing you have lots of options for girls to cycle through and you can realize what works and what doesn't.

You don't sound like an incel to me lol.
<comment>
You don't sound like an incel to me lol.
I am involuntarily celibate, so yes I am, but I don't think I fit the layman's definition. I don't really describe myself as a incel because the word has taken on a meaning of its own at this point which I don't really fit. That said I do want romance/sex/affection and to have a gf, but can't get any of that despite my best efforts, so idk what else I'd call myself.
<comment>
If a girl has ever given you a chance to fuck her for free, then I don't think you qualify as an incel by any normal definition. But post away, normalfaggot.

<comment>
Getting an online gf you can meet up with eventually means you're not an incel. You sound like a spoiled rich kid saying "My family only has 2 maids and I still have chores of my own... sheesh". If they liked you after seeing a pic of you then you're definitely no incel.

Not as happy as i could be. Bought a gaming pc that i always wanted and its been cool. I want to have a gf but i never tried to get one ever so im not "incel" per say although i do relate to them. Im alone right now in a dark room with only rgb lights, my own thoughts and 4chan.
All my friends to my knowledge have had sexual expeirences and gfs. Ive had none of those and the longer it takes will make it harder to make up for i think. I get scared to meet up with them sometimes i always felt i was sort of a backround friend.

Dont know how ugly or attractive i am. I remember being called cute in HS and girl tried to set her friend up with me even though i was obese at the time. most recently a lady at my school called me handsome but i dont put too much stock in that. im 5'8.
do you think you'll die single?
I want to at least try to get a gf. Saying its over without trying is weak to me. Im familiar with blackpill ideology but ive seen refutations of it as i go about life so that gives me hope.
I can understand if you got rejected hundreds or thousands of times and said its over. my case is im scared to take the jump. If i try my hardest and still get no return then its over.

very fucking ugly, 5'8 though
yes, no one shows any interest in me.
one of the only thing that brings me joy are my jobs which make me feel incredibly responsible and capable. i look forward to getting out of school and getting my diploma so i may focus on getting a full time career, moving out and then just getting on with my life. focusing on myself. i have no real connections or friends. i just wanna make as much money as possible. i know it wont fill the hole but it will help, the goal is to make enough money and be secure enough so that one day i can contribute to something greater than myself.
another thing that brings me joy is music. i write lots of songs and poems, one day i wanna make my own music, that would be the best feeling ever. always wanted to do it ever since i was a wee child.
<comment>
yeah but you see that doesnt really mean much because it doesnt actually solve the problem. I'd do anything to get a gf, but what I need is to fix my genetics, which is unfortunately impossible.

So since that isn't possible to achieve, why don't you work on improving something you can actually affect? You know, stuff like having a better diet, working out, getting more into your hobbies... It'll make you feel a bit better.

4. One just a few months ago absolutely shattered me, one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. At the deepest point it triggered my schizoaffectivity and psychosis. She was the type of girl where you didn't care about her past or her age. All I wanted to do was care for her and make her happy because she was perfect.
what's the closest you've been to having a girl like you
My neighbor in hs realized I was fapping to her snap story and genuinely tried to be my friend (this was my peak obesity) but she was also kinda fat and not my type. Also her plan to see if I liked her was to fawn all over my best friend and see if it made me jealous which I thought was callous. Either way the closest I got to a girl was her leaning her head on my shoulder while sitting on the couch.

what'a your life like outside of dating?
I don't date but my life is a waking nightmare, I just sit at home all day fearing the future and outside world. I'm poor as fuck, have never had a job in my life, have no degree and fear it's already too late.

No, I think about roping everyday.

Feeling tired now but i did many martial arts, kept different pets, geek stuff, other physical exercises, building figures, looking for something new to do. I also visit friends in other countries now and then. Or they visit me.

With myself, sure. with my place in the world? no.

Got a decent job in lab operations which is enjoyable enough. it's close by and i don't need to be there all day.

6foot which is king of the manlets in NL but it could be much worse of course.
do you think you'll die single?
yeah there's a pretty good chance on that but i've always been socially avoidant whether i like it or not.

Kissed, held hand, hugged, still no sex. I did visit a prostitute to figure out if i liked it but i was flaccid as fuck the whole time.

what's the closest you've been to having a girl like you
I did have 3 ldr relationships from another country which didn't end up as anything special but one in particular kept bombarding me with candid pics and love letters which is nice so aside from skin hunger i am not completely loveless.
There was also this one date in which a girl really wanted to go out with me but i botched the date because i am captain autismo.

Boring but not bad either, i live with my mother and go to college, most days feel the same but its not as exhausting or crushing as it was in Highschool, im learning to drive so that I can entrtain myself by going to random places. For now i try to entretain myself by reading more books.
are you happy?
I moved arround a lot during my early teenage years so that made me kinda lonely and it didnt get much better until late highschool, that used to be what made me unhappy but not anymore, i dont feel lonely anymore but i still feel pretty unhappy and im not sure why.

I know i sound like a fakecel but its incredibly hard for me to get women to entrtain me for more than a few weeks, ive had only on gf, the other one was just using me to get over her ex, every other girl i feel has just used me for attention.

Just working and coming home. I used to play a lot of tennis but I literally have no one to play with, I used to make music often but I can't pull myself to do that anymore either. I have a few guys I talk to online regularly and play vidya with but still, my life is completely dull compared to what it was when I was in university.
are you happy?
I make a conscious effort to be. I feel like I have a lot to be happy for but yes, my own genetic inferiority, ugliness and loneliness does irk me often. Probably more than it should

I'm an accountant. Hopefully, AI takes over the field so I can have a good excuse to be a perma NEET without my parents feeling like I'm a loser

I know I'll die single but it doesn't mean the heart stops longing for a miracle. I know I shouldn't try and that it's a waste of time for the most part but I get that occasional boost in motivation.

Incels can't have sex with fat women. You're projecting your life experience onto others.
Nowhere close to an incel. Just find a gf online, normalfaggot.

and how will that improve my situation? then i'll have no energy to seek a gf or improve my situation, and what girl wants a cashier bf?

what's the closest you've been to having a girl like you
I found a girl i liked but she was already married so we just talked for a few weeks as friends and then i felt like she started liking me so we started kissing and hugging but i said i didnt feel comfortable being a side piece for a married woman so I asked her to divorce her husband if she wants to date me and she did through a public facebook post(im not sure if she did file the legal documents but i bet even if she didnt her husband did after she said something like that publicly) announcing to the world shes leaving him and she asked me out but i realized she would probably do the same to me if i agreed once she found her next "level up" so i just blocked her phone number and social media and would just start running away whenever she tried approaching me irl(im faster than her and have more stamina).
Thankfully i never told her where i live so she just gave up eventually instead of harrassing me at my home or something.

Well if you couldn't do uni then you have the regular life track of scrounging together jobs so you can afford to a somewhat decent life. If you have some saved income, though, you can SEAmaxx at the very least and no girl wants to date a NEET who's not exceptionally good-looking.

Nope, uni is not for me.

bro, i can't make friends here, how will i make friends in a foreign country with an unknown language full of scammers criminals and corruption?
But if i ever get my life back on track, i will 100% try interpals. Not with the view to find a wife, but i improve my conversational skills with normies. Right now, i'm good at writing like this, but talking or every conversing with normies is incredibly difficult. 
no girl wants to date a NEET who's not exceptionally good-looking.
It's 2023. What girl wants to date a cashier? 
It's getting worse and worse for men everyday. 1/3 of men are incels right now.
<comment>
imo anyone who wants a gf but can't get one is an incel, and that's me. I'm decent looking in that I can get many matches on tinder and the occasional hookup but nothing serious/long term. It makes me super assmad desu
<comment>
I never claimed to be a truecel im more of a "mentalcel" i guess.
My mental illness is stopping me from commiting to any girl.
<comment>
You SEAmaxx by having an LDR with her then you fly to her or you go there and use dating apps and you have 10000x the responses because you're a foreigner. It's not extremely simple but it makes it vastly easier.
Also 1/3 of men aren't incels. That's just a complete lie. That stat was about men 18-30 and was very misleading. See pic related. The overwhelming majority of young men have sex and the rest are most likely quite young and will get there. Even ITT the majority of guys are normalfags or they've had like 0-2 rejections in their lifetime. This is routinely the case across """in"""cel internet spaces.
has sex regularly
Incels have it rough these days, sheesh.
Well you're not an incel at all.
<comment>
didnt get to dating but we were getting close to that point
i had decided right before everything went down to tell her how i felt and it seemed like she had feelings for me too
never actually got to confirm if the feelings were mutual
but im too smart to be what most people expect of an incel anyway
not dumb enough to unironically hate all women because i cant get laid

has sex regularly
It's not regularly, I go months without sex and when I do get it it's only once. Females are chad only and I just didn't make the cut.
<comment>
If i wanted to have sex without love, i would pay a prostitute. Sex tourism won't fill the void in my heart. that's the issue with SEAmaxxing- either you move there and live in a shithole, or you move her here but then you lose your JBW card because she can choose other men from your country. 
That's just a complete lie. That stat was about men 18-30 and was very misleading. See pic related.
Have you considered that men are shamed for being virgins and women are shamed for being promiscuous? How many of those men payed a prostitute or fucked some drunk landwhale at a party once? Men are competetive and self-consious, we want to look better than other men, especially "those incel losers".
<comment>
I have never had sex so yes i am a incel.
Go cry about it.

You dated a girl in your teens? If so then you're not an incel.

I go months without sex
Holy fuck, incel moment. Who could survive this? Jesus christ.
you move her here but then you lose your JBW card because she can choose other men from your country.
What does that mean? She'll instantly cheat on you?
men are shamed for being virgins and women are shamed for being promiscuous
So the incels are just hiding in the shadows? Rarely even on /r9k/, mind you. I humbly doubt that.
You could easily, though.
I guess you have to deal with the other two options over being alone forever, maybe.
If you can date a girl, then you can also have sex with one, and vice versa, in almost all cases.
That person is incredibly obviously baiting.

<comment>
What does that mean? She'll instantly cheat on you?
No, but whenever she goes out she'll see men taller, prettier, plainly better than me. And asian girls are considered attractive her. I will no longer have the JBW card. 
So the incels are just hiding in the shadows? 
it's a spectrum. A lot of low-tier normies are struggling like us but convince themselves and others that they are better cause a fat drunk girl fucked them once or they had a gf 10 years ago. 
Even a lot of married men are incels- "dead bedrooms" and all that. Yet they look like succesful normies to the outside since no man wants to admit even his wife isn't attracted to him.
<comment>
I used to make these threads so men who don't otherwise have a medium to vent about a peculiar predicament (inceldom) have a place to congregate and post things on their minds. I'm not a moderator here so I don't make the rules but don't you think it's obnoxious for women to come here to find a handsome bf when they already have 100 apps, 1000 threads and 1000 discord servers to scout the best looking man they can get?
Groundbreaking piece of advice
Just use Tinder
I haven't browsed /r9k/ in a while but from what I know, he's a progressive who is most likely on a mission to prove that male loneliness or suffering is a result of their own laziness which is probably why suggests dire solutions like moving to SEA

Interesting arguments, I'll consider it.

That's how every relationship works unless you're a gigachad/gigastacy power couple.
convince themselves and others that they are better cause a fat drunk girl fucked them once or they had a gf 10 years ago. 
Those guys are normalfags and can find another girl, yes, like many ITT.
married men are incels
If they're married normalfags then I don't think their lack of sex is a grave issue. In fact, in that original study the amount of sex inside relationships/marriages has increased over the recent years. The """incel problem""" isn't being spurred by troubled sexless marriages.
I am a progressive, but male loneliness is very much real, just most of the self-proclaimed incels are LARPing normalfags. I think the "incel problem" is a meme and less than .5% of men are incels, though, but there are incels still, at least until they can afford to SEAmaxx.
High shoolers shouldn't be allowed to consider themselves incels. Your life hasn't even begun.

If you're female, you can't be incel

less than .5% of men are incels
Lol. How did you come to that conclusion?
<comment>
It's just a guess tbdesu. Idk what it actually is. I think there was one study showing 6% of men at 26 were virgins in Italy and only half of them haven't had an opportunity yet, and most guys who "haven't had the opportunity" from what I see just barely try to get a bf. The real number could be higher or lower, though. Idk.

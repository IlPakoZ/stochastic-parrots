I'm incredibly bored, and because of my boredom I've decided that today I am going to pick a direction and just start walking until sunset, at which point I'll turn back. I will not deviate from a straight line unless I am physically incapable of traversing the path in front of me or if it would be a crime to do so. After I post this I will begin walking, I have decided to listen to the audiobook of Dostoyevsky's "Notes From Underground", Plato's "The Republic", and the Strugatsky brother's "Roadside Picnic" as I walk which will last me the entirety of the walk.
sounds like a nice plan anon, I was reading the republic the other day. great read and enjoy your walk! try and get a dog in the future, beats walking alone and maybe carry some snacks. I do the same tho instead of one direction, I kinda just walk around in circles around town
just start walking until sunset
How much alcohol did you pack?
Get a compass, when people walk in nature they tend to walk in circles despite their best efforts
I will not deviate from a straight line unless I am physically incapable of traversing the path in front of me
I'm familiar with this story!

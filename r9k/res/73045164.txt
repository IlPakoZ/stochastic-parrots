why are they pushing tattoos so fucking hard?
i used snapchat and they have all the ads and celebrities. every single foid had a bunch of stupid doodles all over them. in youtube ads i see foids with tattoos. every single girl on social media has tattoos
not even meaningful tattoos always stupid little doodles
It's a ritualized statement of hatred for how the world was back when white women didn't get tattoos. Symbolic coalburning.
Tattoos are literally anti christian.
You can't get into heaven with a tattoo.
who? i haven't watched any movies in five or so years, but i never saw that shit in them
Imagine being so fragile you get mad about people having shitty drawings on their skin.
Who fucking cares
no one is pushing tattoos, you freak. you're just so obsessed with them that you see them everywhere. literally stop looking.
God hates tattoos

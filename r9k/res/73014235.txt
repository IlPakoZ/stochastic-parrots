What do you think about having an identity, anons?
People more and more, these days push to label themselves something e.g: "I am a communist", "I am an artist" etc.
This also applies to people labeling other people e.g: "The weird kid" or "He's a democrat"
This is probably just me being autistic but I don't want an identity or label attached to me.
I actively withhold information from people so they can't form an image or label to attach to me. I don't even want to be acknowledged or perceived sometimes even, because having an identity scrubs a person of all the depth they may have and reduces them to just "the ____"

Changed my mind, most people are simple enough to be described entirely in a single sentence.

Identity or personality isn't what you believe in or what you do. Having too much of a personality usually gets you isolated, and you should learn to show as little personality in the public as possible if not even fake one, basically having your private and public personality. But it is important to show your personality to people you know for a while. It's especially important if they're female cause you want the female to like your personality.

Very interesting question anon.
I have been reading up and thinking about it a lot lately.
From my understanding identity and ego (in the sense of you) is a very important topic and issues here lead to most mental health problems.
I have thought about talking to a therapist about how to handle these things in a healthy way. As an example: How does one separate themselves from negative identity? If you are known as THE loser or THE weird one how do you detach yourself so it doesnt devour your sense of self and you start believing it too.
But Goddamn therapists are expensive as fuck like 150 bucks per session.

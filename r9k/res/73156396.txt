Despite the korean shilling here, I can attest that the average western girl will still pick a average bearded whtie guy with 0 fashion sense over a neatly groomed japanese/korean man. I know this because I'm part sicilian part korean myself and I pass as more korean than anything else. I have neat heair, those 'gay' pouty lips, clear skin, bushy eyebrows, even long eyelashes thanks to my italian side. From time to time complete strangers will compliment my looks, but the average 20something roastie will find me as sexually intriguing as grandmas wallpaper. I simply don't appear as a future dad, provider, husband, someone who can protect her, ironically most women my age masculine-mogg me and look older than me. Jfl.

10/10 everyone loves me because I'm the main character
<comment>
i'm cool and attractive and everyone thinks my posts are funny
<comment>
I make the voice threads and the gay voice threads 
people seem to find me very very very anno0ying
id say theyd give me like a -5/10
<comment>
9/10 I'm always based and redpilled but me being too awesome would cause me to take a small hit due to review bombing
<comment>
8.5/10. I post the cuckolding threads and they're objectively quality. Unfortunately I get brigaded and saged by the seething incels
<comment>
They wouldn't rate me at all. They would just skip me because I'm kinda boring.
Also I never make threads.
<comment>
0/10 I make a lot of bait threads and threads about my piss fetish.
<comment>

I'm nice and sometimes horny but it's nothing interesting
<comment>

I can't remember the last time I took a shower and I don't even feel dirty

I probably do but I don't care

same 
actually it was in october, as long as you keep washing the private areas+pits+feet+whole head regularly you're not gonna smell bad or have any infection
when you sweat a lot your back will start reeking so that's when you gotta take a shower if you don't live alone

Impressive. Longest I've gone in recent memory is I think about three weeks. Right about then is when the thermal updrafts coming off my balls overwhelm my laziness.

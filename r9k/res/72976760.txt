I did 6 12 hour shifts in March, but we have more workers in April so I think I won't need to do it anymore this month. I hope your work hires more people so you can get fewer inhuman shifts.

I think I am starting to face burn out desu, I work 6am-4pm mon-fri, I am going to ask to get my schedule changed to go down to a normal 40 hour week
<comment>
How do you work like that and not kill yourself within 3 months? I have a job as well but it's only a few hours a day. How do normalfags live with themselves?

<comment>

Im not smart or hard working enough to get a degree that will land me a comfy desk or computer job where I could work from home. If I get a blue collar job Ill fuck up my body by the time I retire and if I just wageslave at minimum wage my life will essentially be over. Im hoping I can buy a gun before im 30 so that Ill at least have a way out of here. I have no idea how normalfags can stand doing this shit all their life without going insane, I work 12 hours a week right now and I still dread every shift.

f I just wageslave at minimum wage my life will essentially be over
the thing is, thats very unlikely to happen. a heck of a lot of minimum wagies are druggies, alcoholics or have other problems such as unstable families - these things mean there is rapid turnover in minimum wage jobs, especially ones that employ young people. 
this means that (you), as a probably pretty stable if depressive person, by just showing up every day consistently, can quickly become the most experienced &amp; dependable wagie at any given job. i worked as a barista at a small independent place for about 1.5 years, and by the end, out of 12 or so employees, id been there the 2nd longest. all the other people there when i started either moved, changed jobs, stopped showing up, got fired for being drunk, or got fired for stealing. 
basically if youre not a drug addict and you show up every day, and if youre young, theres a very good chance youll get promoted to higher paid roles within 5 years or less - and after another 5 years theres a good chance theyll pay for you to go to college so you can get promoted further. big traditional companies do actually reward loyalty because career employees that actually know the ins and outs of the business are valuable. not all of them, but some companies still are like this; you can do a little investigating and asking on reddit or whatever to see how much a place promotes from within to decide if you should stick with it. from what ive heard, walmart, home depot, trader joes, aldi, costco, and whole foods are very good for this.

by just showing up every day consistently
I'm an oldfag wageslaver since I volunteered to fight for Israel right out of high school and I can't emphasize how much showing up and putting in some effort. With degrees and certifications (takes more effort, sorry) you can curate yourself into specialties and jobs where you do very little actual work.

and putting in some effort will make a difference. So many people don't show up at all and try to scam disability and SSD - they are so caught up in trying to run a scam that they don't see the legit path is better for you.

im so tired of being alone
i just want friends
<comment>
what would you like to do with a friend?
<comment>
do you have a job?
after high school, most of the people you know disappear from your life. This is normal.
Most new friends you make as an adult will be co-workers, people that go to your church, etc.
or you can join some sort of club and meet people there.
<comment>
thats the thing, i cant make friends because im the most boring person on the planet
i have the personality of a plant
i dont have a job
<comment>
do you want to try being friends anyway?
<comment>
shouldn't you get a job first? isn't that more important than having friends at the moment?
<comment>
Wanna try being penpals? I know it's not the same, but it's better than nothing.
<comment>
i am also boring and have the personality of a plant. you can add me even though i dont really talk maybe we play some of the same games

I hate people like you because you likely already have friends and when I make these threads people just attack me but when you make them people are nice to you. Eat shit and die.
<comment>
Wow, what prompts a man to be rude like this? I know you need a hug, anon. I need one too. Why not be friends instead?
<comment>
just be friends :3
Yeah like your 30 other friends. kys faggot
<comment>
why everyone mean to me
proceeds to be retarded
stay friendless all your life please
<comment>
You are imagining things, Anon.
<comment>
stay friendless all your life
I already was when I was caring towards others. Serial killers and child rapists have friends and loved ones so equating ability to get those to morality is silly.
fuck you.
<comment>
i dont have any friends, anon, it's the truth. i just can't connect with people.
<comment>
I bet you are a woman. If you are a male you probably have at least 5 people on some messaging app friendslist
<comment>
i am a very sad man. it's not hard to believe, is it?
<comment>
What are you doing to get friends?
<comment>
nothing apparently, this person posts everyday and literally ignores any person that wants to befriend them
<comment>
exactly my point, anyone who does this is just attentionwhoring. 
Yeah and you would ghost anyone that tried to befriend you and use some pissass excuse.
<comment>
I wish I had some vidya friends but I just feel uncomfortable with most people
<comment>
what abandoned the thread to go play a game with your friends? fucking normie
<comment>
No, he just makes the same one thread every day to get a rise out of literal retards like you. I love how stupid you are. It's almost pitying.
<comment>
random ego stroking
how original. You probably think you are smarter than everyone right
<comment>
No, I'm also pretty dumb. Smarter than your twig ass at least so what does that say about you?
<comment>
i dont know what to say anymore
<comment>
no you're just dumb and bitter
come on, post contact :d
<comment>
Nah, not bitter. Just laughing at retards like you.
<comment>
random shaming
yawn. average normie behavior.
they wont they are milking you for attention.
<comment>
Nah, not normie either. Your seethe fuels me though.
<comment>
You say you arent one just like they do. Bet you have a lot of friends on discord huh.
<comment>
Literally what are you talking about? I'm not OP. Retard. Seethe.
<comment>
How many discord friends you got, huh fellow 
non normie
<comment>
that's what a bitter person would say, yup
pretty much
<comment>
Take your meds, you clearly can't follow a conversation when you bring up unrelated things. Instead of ridicule I feel pity now, I hope you unironically get the help you deserve.
<comment>
hahaha I hit the nail on the head.
<comment>
Why are we all so deracinated? Why can't we just be born into communities with traditions and prebuilt social structures at most levels like all our ancestors?

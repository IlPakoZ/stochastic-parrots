I'm finally giving up on women.
They are not worth it. They are not interesting. They are not friendly. They are not cool. They are not strong. They are not hardworking. They are not creative. They are not funny. They are not original. They are not anything.
They're not even that sexy past a minuscule window of their youth.
There is literally NOTHING to gain from a woman. You will NEVER satisfy them. You think there are exceptions to that? What made me turn to this realization is that even the "based autistic lurking femcels" are not any different from the normal woman.
Stop chasing them. It's a scam. Literally enjoy anything else in your life.

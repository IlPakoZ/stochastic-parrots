How can I get a trad and/or mommy gf?
Orthodox Judaism
I mean, as far as trad goes, you should probably join some religious group (I already know you won't).
And mommy... women are people, and like all people they have random as fuck personalities. You just have to meet women, and if you're lucky one who is into mommy stuff might become your gf. My wife is a bit of a dommy mommy, but usually we just do vanilla.
You have to be gigachad:
And then you still have to play the numbers game against all of the other gigachads because mommy gfs are so few and far between. You also need to own a McMansion and be CEO of a business. If you can't do all of that, it's already over.
Here is the thing, I have basically 80% of this list, and the other things I am on road for. 
But lets say I acquire all of them.
How would I go about getting a mommy gf then? 
It seems like to me the gigachad thing is just a meme.
And just so you know I will tell you exactly what I lack for now:
I am going to the gym 3 times a week but I am not quite at the six pack yet. Will take me like 6 more months until I cut enough, have made some great progress alread though, am in pretty good shape though some belly fat is still there.
And the business I am CEO of still needs a year or so to really take off.
Then I will have everything on your list and be gigachad as you put it. Except I would have a 7figure income and a 7inch dick. Also I am 6ft4 so its also more then your minimum.
So anon, tell me what do?
Seems to me that the market for mommy gfs is running dry, its impossible to get a good gf even as CEO or chad.
Look at all the politicians, billionaires and Popstars getting divorced.
Its all completely over.

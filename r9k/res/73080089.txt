not really, I'm not so much into jewish propaganda
He's a simpering, tearful bitch. If you need "12 Rules to Clean Your Penis and Prep Your Bussy" to function, you should be able to start understanding why he is such a dirty, Hebrew issue.
He was ok, didn't expect him to get so big but you can learn a lot about the game through him but that's how the game works.
you petulant lobsters. you machiavellian rats. you machinations of chaos.
Anonymous TROLL DEMONS could be here, he thought to himself...
He did a great series on the bible that made me realize why bible is a thing and how it can make sense. Everything else is mostly garbage. He should try to invent something or dabble in hard science where he would learn how his ideas aren't working.

Who knew tranny virus was so rampant. I now have 2 autistic nerdy guys who I knew become trannies . What tf is going on ?
<comment>
I was informed by based schizos that it was social contagion
<comment>
But why nerdy autist who I use to talk on for hours with about crazy shit and now they are trannies . Why them specifically. You dont see chad becoming a tranny and most of them look hideous
<comment>
Chad didn't fail at being a man and didn't go down the whole porn sinkhole. Chad isn't isolated so groomers won't even try to gaslight him
If Chad is doing it great being a man why ruin it?
<comment>
A lot of trannies tend to be autistics.
<comment>
Arent autists suppose to be immune to propaganda?
How do we beat the trannies
<comment>
trooning gave me nothing but a social upgrade i went from a 5'2 feminine trap to a 5'2 feminine girl (male) . living as a 5'2 manlet and eventually getting ruined by testosterone would be a suifuel life
<comment>
Women are genuinely privileged with basically no fking effort to do and the autists are catching on it. Smart move
<comment>
The only realistic option would be to cut them from support from gov and media. 
It would revert the situation back to when they were just a small bunch of weirdoes doing crossdressing events from time to time and most people would outright ignore what a tranny is. 
Of course this is very, very difficult
<comment>
A few of the players at my local MTG store identity as women now. They weren't the normies with a nerdy hobby. They were the who are clearly the spectrum.
<comment>
We need to pit them against a minority group . Maybe niggers and shit skins and watch their fake construct of the world break down in face of truth harsh reality . We need to break them mentally and let them know that there is no hope for trannies in the future
<comment>
Arent autists suppose to be immune to propaganda?
Yes, and masculinity is propaganda. Do you get it yet?
<comment>
Ur brain worms wont work on me tranny my defense against dark sets are level 50 plus I have a blessing from chud god
<comment>
+1, the whole masculinity concept is used to make worker drones.
<comment>
I'm not a tranny, I just understand why they do it. Men are pressured from birth to behave a certain way and allow their beauty to decompose as they age. This is unpleasant, but other people want you to do it, so most do. Autists realize it's a scam and take drugs to stay cute and not have responsibilities.
<comment>
But they look so ugly and why cant I identify as black if u can identify as a women
<comment>
But they look so ugly
Because you only look at the ugly ones, go to >>>/lgbt/ to see the cuties.
if u can identify as a women
Reading comprehension check, once again I'm not a tranny.
<comment>
Autists couldn't care less about their "beauty" and trooning makes them uglier the 99'99% of uglier anyways
They're either autogynephilic or unsincere gays
<comment>
Autists couldn't care less about their "beauty"
I'm an autist and puberty was traumatic for me because my naturally smooth face and skin became rough and hairy and the hair on my head eventually started falling out. Who would enjoy this? Especially autists, who hate change? I only stayed male voluntarily because T gave me chadface and muscles. If I were a low-T male who still had to go through that I'dve trooned 100%.
<comment>
Yawn, get a better LARP
<comment>
What exactly am I LARPing as, retard?
<comment>
TRANNIES ARE RAIDING THIS THREAD . All incels be ready for war . Kill every tranny u see in this thread and let them know theyre kind is not welcomed
<comment>
Your mom lol lmao
<comment>
You can't mentally break me more than depression has done already, you are free to try, I will laugh at your pitiful attempts.
<comment>
Autists are always obsessed with the shallowest entertainment aspects of society: video games, cartoon shows, card games, dnd/wh40k, literal toys like lego. They're usually sexual degenerates in the first place, like furies and footfags, so it was very easy fr the jews to market this sexuality to them. They get to play pretend, never take any kind of responsibility, and the whole thing is a constant sexual experience. It's perfect for them.
<comment>
The biden government is creating a new generation of society, using the media and education systems as a means of manipulation and brainwashing.
<comment>
spergs realize that female have an inordinate amount of power and privilege in modern society. There's also a forced social rule that trannies must be treated as if they are actually women.
They see it as a way to a better life, like a Chinaman immigrating to the USA. It's basically sexual emigration.
<comment>
picrel seems to be a good hypothesis for why that might be
<comment>
It's fucking unreal how much easier women have it, I had fucking strangers pay for my food in restaurants when going out, complete fucking strangers, this would never happen if I looked like a guy, also female hormones literally inundate your brain with blissful feelings 24/7.
<comment>
Autistic /robot/ here, 49 now, not gay, male.
Consider that we were bullied at school BADLY and that nobody gave a shit about us. Our teachers joined in the teasing to keep the rest of the class on their side. Our administrators wanted the problem to go away. Our parents didn't know what to do and/or just beat us.
Going trans puts us in a Protected Group. Nobody can touch us. Even our parents would be afraid of us (or they can now turn their problem-child into a virtue-signal).
I didn't want to be a woman, I just wanted the pain to end and to stop being shit on by everyone. But maybe some adolescents might choose otherwise.
<comment>
Autists are nice. You're very rude
<comment>
Yes the guy with a wall full of funkopops, spends all his time consuming Disney owned media and throws a tantrum if given any food not from McDonald's or his favourite brand of frozen food is really immune to propaganda.
<comment>
You may be into something, a tranny is coomsumer. 
The tranny is into a subscription based lifestyle that requires aultiple operation and a lifelong drug supply together with a whole set of aspirational products to reafirm his new identity
<comment>
Autists aren't nice. They're meek because they're incapable of causing real harm, so they reserve themselves. Most of them are just barely self perceptive enough to realize how funny and pathetic one of them looks when they actually try asserting themselves.

xe has the eggycel phenotype
<comment>
Poor kid. His dad should've raised him better
<comment>
Probably doesn't have a dad, hence why he quotes "alpha" videos. Same problem often occurs with trannies who take it in the opposite direction.
<comment>
What is the stereotypical autist like? Shy, anxious, shut in, often submissive. Not very "masculine" traits. Such a blend of autism is feminine. 
These people likely wanted to be women since childhood and hid their identities for fear of being outcast.
Add in the fact that women get to wear all the pretty and colorful clothing which autists see the beauty in and not just "that girl's red dress makes me want to fuck her"
<comment>
theres two types of autists. the ones that go full natsoc and the ones that go full tranny. autism is a spectrum so you got the consumer type and the pol type i guess. autists are extreme people in that way. also autists dont feel comfortable being fully female or male so they fall hard for the tranny shit. basically its a solution for them why they feel weird (oh im trans) instead of understanding they are simply autistic.
<comment>
men look hot when they age into actual men. adult responsibilities also dont vanish from playing fetish dress up lol.
<comment>
Ive seen some weird chad to tranny pipelines
Usually body builders or gymbros
I guess they get into that stuff as a cope for not being happy with their body and then when it doesnt help they troon out?
<comment>
wow, talk about backwards ass fucking logic there
<comment>
trannies are so prevalent because birth control has turned modern women into disgusting ogres. They're almost as bad looking as trannies sometimes.
<comment>
its almost like "just become a man" doesn't work for people with gender dysphoria.
<comment>
>/tttt/
go back
<comment>
Water filter
NOW
<comment>
It doesn't because women aren't feminine anymore. As long as women refuse to be women, this will continue. Being a man is hard work, why would you do that work when there is no woman waiting at the end?
<comment>
I was here on r9k before you ever started browsing probably lmfao.
why are westerners like this? yes your women are all men lmao.
<comment>
They're only immune to mass broadcast conventional propaganda. Conventional propaganda appeals to social inclusion and fear of ostracization. Autists don't care about that; only their specific niche interests matter.
However, if you can convince an autist that something is their idea or part of their identity they will go all in, flouting any social apprehension or inhibition that would otherwise stop a neurotypical. It makes them exceptionally vulnerable to more individualized and personal propaganda. (Grooming)
<comment>
Why assume it's just gender dysphoria, then, that is caused by "resistance to social conditioning" rather than stemming from a root issue? Would we all be unable to make eye contact and have weird obsessions? 
It doesn't really matter since it can't be proven either way. Your own citation says that the theory has merely been presented (and rightfully so, it *could* be the reason, I guess), not studied.
<comment>
That explanation doesn't assume that gender dysphoria is caused by resistance to social conditioning, rather that the resistance to social conditioning makes the person less likely to repress their dysphoria to conform to society.
And yeah, it's just a hypothesis, but I wanted to bring it up since many like to reference the correlation of autism to transgender people to state that autism causes people to be transgender, or that the correlation between the two invalidates transgender people. 
That I believe is just one possible explanation, but people like to think that it is the only explanation when it is not.
<comment>
if you're a Chris-Chan tier loser you really don't have much to lose by trooning out, a bottom value female gets preferential treatment to a bottom value male. You don't even need to take the hormones if you don't want to just crossdress and change your pronouns lol.
<comment>
Lonely and unable to connect to other people
Fundamentally feels they are 'wrong' with the world
Low test
Little to no masculinity in their identity such as physical strength and typically 'male' interests
Consumes porn and associates sexual release and desire with the simple idolization/sexualization of women
Sees the demonisation of masculinity on the whole and subsequent social advantages offered to women
wants to fit in
It's pretty simple really. You could also make a convincing argument for environmental exposure to xenoeostrogens which is quite compelling but the head game alone is more than sufficient to explain what's going on.
<comment>
It offers explanation and solution to autist's lifelong problems. As autist man you are "extremely male" in some ways, but also shifted to opposite side in some others. That makes you fit nowhere properly and unable to relate to anyone. Too bad trooning out solves nothing. The brain is broken and can't be fixed.
<comment>
It's a psyop OP.

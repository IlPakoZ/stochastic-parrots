what sort of home do you want to live in anons? i was daydreaming about life as a hikkineet femcoomer and thinking about how nice it'll be to live in a condo or apartment so i don't have to take care of anything or have any responsibilities and can stay in my cozy room, but i'd be worried about if someone hears me screaming or moaning as i cum again and again

My ideal reality is one where I live in some kind of apartment with a cute femcel/fembot/NEET girl that I can support with her habits, and in turn she'll make me feel better after a long day at work, where we handle each other's physical and emotional needs, and we hang out for the rest of the night playing video games or watching anime until it's time for me to sleep for the next day at work.
Of course it's just a fantasy because in no world am I ever making enough to support someone on a single income

i'm ok being trailer trash. as long as i own the structure, it has a washer/dryer hookup, and i don't have to pay$400 a month to heat it in winter, i'm all good.

I want a hut in the jungle so I can make explosives in peace

That is the same dream I had kek.
I dreamt that I was some attractive late teen girl planning to leave before the later phases of life. I dreamt that all I would do is NEET, touch myself, and whore my tight young pussy out until I had every STD, sex disorder, and every attractive man on Tinder cum in my infertile pleasure hole.
I also dreamt about how great it must be to be able to orgasm without any mess. No cum to clean up. How nice it must be to even use a vibrator. All I would do all day is rub my pussy and I would still be more valuable to society than the most hard working ugly man. 
Or maybe instead of being NEET, I provide valuable work by selling my body to incels and own a mansion at 21.

I unironically would provide for a femcoomer gf, she can even have online bfs and id let her fuck ppl on the side as long as she loves me. By provide i mean basic living things tho

If you just so happen to be XX, yes post. Include timestamp for verification.

owning the structure would mean i'd be liable for maintaining it all by myself which sounds like a lot of work
having a bf sounds like work and responsibilities desu
how long have you been dreaming about it
<comment>
BF is more work, but you get to put less effort into some other aspects, and you can make them get you off instead of using your hands/toys all the time, so it's a give and take kind of deal I think
<comment>
that thought never crossed my mind
i live between my desk and chair
im barely human at this point

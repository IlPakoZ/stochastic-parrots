What do you think about Musk's theory of virtue signaling? Have there been any scientific investigations which back up or refute the theory?
<comment>
It's fairly well-known and well-studied in behavioral science.
<comment>
I found this one recent relvant article, ironically published in nature. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562 - 023 - 01537 - 5
kinda makes me wonder if people who "trust the science" trust this science
<comment>
Virtue signaling is also about simple cowardice.
<comment>
Has Musk ever given his stance on whether possession of computer images ought to be considered a criminal offence?
<comment>
Yes made clear that twitter does not want to be used for child porn. Not sure if that means he thinks it should be illegal but that would be inline with his stated (though not always consistent) belief that anything legal should be allowed on twitter.
<comment>
Yeah he obviously just doesn't want illegal stuff on his website, but that doesn't necessarily mean he agrees that a photo of a naked kid on your computer should be able to get you arrested and on the sex offender's list.
<comment>
What the fuck does this have to do with pronouns
<comment>
any good recommended reading to get into the theory of virtue signaling // signaling theory in general? maybe a intro into Robin Hanson
<comment>
I look at his picture here, and I wonder if an AI could be trained to spot pedos with high confidence just on photos alone.
<comment>
What the fuck does this have to do with pronouns
that cuck who suicided obviously had his pronouns in bio. Think with your brains, midwit
<comment>
Leftists = evil. 
A person doesn't have to be a genius like Musk to figure that one out.
<comment>
So fucking what? He probably wore pants too. What a desperate stretch
<comment>
You mean people who pretend to be leftists whilst actually fucking children like a conservative are evil. But that's because conservatives are evil.
<comment>
a genius like Musk
Doesn't take a genius to figure out Musk ain't one

You are brainwashed. If you really believed what you say, you'd not be online. You wouldn't even be alive. 
You are either a shill, a bot, a zombie parrot, or just evil. Probably all four.

Consider instead that maybe you're so utterly mistaken about what I and people like me believe that it borders on a clinically diagnosable delusional disorder.
<comment>
Don't care what you think or have faith in. You are meaningless.
<comment>
If it doesn't matter what I think or "have faith in" then you're just a misanthrope I guess? What if I thought the same things you did and had faith in the same things you did?
<comment>
It just shows you how bizarrely retarded clown 
world is
we cant let science be undermined
ok but the data shows that you undermined trust in science by being a retarded fucking sperg
REEEEEEEEEE
Every western institution is fucking joke being run by mental rejects
<comment>
stfu pedo troon, you "believe" whatever is inserted into your head by reddit for your kike controllers. You dont have thoughts, you run your programs
<comment>
They somehow found a way to make sexual degeneracy, mental illness, and child abuse a civil rights crusade. You really think they're *not* going to take advantage of that?
<comment>
NTA but the fact that you say >>72993246 marks you as a threat. You viewing child abuse as a political issue means you might excuse, justify, and/or ignore child abuse in the right political circumstances. If you want to tell us what twisted beliefs led you to getting that way so that I can better protect my family from people like you, go right ahead.
<comment>
ironic post lol
Everyone in this thread beside me ought to be involuntarily committed
<comment>
You viewing child abuse as a political issue means you might excuse, justify, and/or ignore child abuse in the right political circumstances.
Right, I'm the one making it a political issue. Not all the Republican politicians and Christian youth group leaders who uniltaterally labelled a marginalised group "groomers" in order to push through legislation and were then caught fucking kids themselves. Not the person I was replying to who literally said "leftists = evil" in response to someone with pronouns in their twitter bio getting caught with cheese pizza.
You people are deranged hypocrites and it is you your family needs protection from.
<comment>
/lgbt/ openly admits that they're child molesters
<comment>
All of 4chan used to. You don't belong.
<comment>
please list the republican politicians and christian youth group leaders who called trannies groomers and pushed for legislation and got caught fucking kids
<comment>
Why bother, you've already proved that you're willing to excuse, justify, and/or ignore child abuse in the right political circumstances
<comment>
who is you? did you know multiple posters can reply to the same thread?
<comment>
There's a difference between posting pedobear and literally unironically supporting pedos.
<comment>
I'm the one making it a political issue
Yes. To be more specific, you're the one liable to commit Type II errors of child abuse identification. Conservatives committing Type I errors isn't a threat to my family's safety.
<comment>
Like the difference between posting "Hitler was right" and literally unironically being a nazi, right?
<comment>
I am literally a National Socialist.
<comment>
You literally just made this shit up because you're politicising this issue, deranged hypocrite. I just pointed out the many, many Type II errors conservatives commit all the fucking time. But noo, gotta believe it's the evil leftists! Gotta excuse, justify, and/or ignore the rest!
<comment>
Oh. Well. Would you look at that. Huh.
<comment>
ironic post, you should have your head split open so people who arent retarded can examine how fleshbots pass turing tests
<comment>
you are literally a tranny
<comment>
M8 you can't even come up with an original comeback, to call you a bot would be a disservice to the incredible strides made in the field of AI recently
My, how original!
<comment>
The interpretation as virtue signalling is wrong. It's a class marker. People proudly display their pronouns on Twitter because it signals allegiance to the dominant class' ideology. It's a signal of cultural capital. That's why these things are always a bit dumb or based on bullshit: they are popular *because* they are easy to attack. This way, lower-class people push back against it, and it makes it clear that they are not part of the elite.
It not signalling virtue for virtue, it's signalling virtue as a legitimizing myth for the ruling class to stay in power.
<comment>
you are literally a pedo tranny. I am not memeing, you literally are
<comment>
Ah yes, putting pronouns in your bio, truly allowing the ruling class to stay in power. And here I thought it was the millions of dollars they pump into anti-gay super PACs to divide the working class.
<comment>
News to me. What, you think you can just manifest shit by posting it on 4chan? lol
Question then is why you want more pedo trannies in the world
<comment>
you live in a constant state of psychosis due to propaganda and HRT. You have no fucking grasp on reality whatsoever
<comment>
The irony keeps piling on

Why is /sci/ the most schizophrenic board?

That was always just FBI trying to lure victims they could exploit via their criminal informant program. You're low IQ if you fell for that. Next time you see you FBi informant handler, ask him how Kirt is doing and see if he can find out when 420chan is going to be back online.
<comment>
What if I thought the same things you did and had faith in the same things you did?
I don't give a shit. You are insignificant and meaningless, both on a personal level and in the grand scheme of things. 
Your problem is you think you matter or that your thoughts and ideas matter. They do not. You are still in the infantile stage of conciousness.
<comment>
Always has been, newfren, welcome to the board, but please keep the non-PC language to a minimum though.

<comment>
You seem to care a whole lot about what I think and believe, considering how much you fantasise about it. It seems to have affected you more than you are affecting me with your baseless psychobabble.
<comment>
They're just saying this to trigger you and other pearl clutchers, same as 15 years ago. That's what makes it fun. And what makes it even more fun is that telling you that still won't stop you from taking the bait.
<comment>
There's already an admitted literal nazi in the thread and I do believe he's on your side.

You really need to go back m8.

yeah, they are called Democrats, Labour, leftists, etc. 
I don't pick sides.
<comment>
Would you stop projecting on me, it's honestly weirding me out a little at this point
<comment>
Yet it doesn't occur to you that conservatives screaming THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!! are the biggest pearl clutchers of all? We were capable of seeing that 15 years ago but for some reason a part of the website became incredibly hypocritical about it.
<comment>
whut? NTA, you are letting the voices in your head confuse you.
<comment>
Is that why all the nazis voted Republican last election?
<comment>
U R a troon aren't you? self absorbed, mentally strange, cannot understand basic concepts, lacking empathy, bossy, bitchy, easily offended, etc No wonder suicide rates are almost 50% with your kind.
<comment>
Helpful guide:
Not "Literal nazi":
posting "ZOMB I LOVE HITLER SO MUCH" on the internet to annoy troons
Actual "Literal nazi":
openly using state and corporate power to silence and criminalize dissent to your political ideology
Not pearl clutching
being anti-child castration
Actual pearl clutching
declaring misgendering to be literal genocide
<comment>
What is the most straightforward way to appear legitimate to the elite? Being anti-gay, or creating the illusion that you care about the weak and the oppressed?
Now go to an art museum, and see that all the woke postcolonial exhibitions, and how the small text thanks rich donators for their support. Look up big financial institutions' DEI pages. Look at Mastercard "making payment safe for trans and non-binary people". Look what ideology is enforced in Harvard. Harvard is not working class.

That's much more based than I'd expect from him.

Kek, so many retards in this thread.
What books do you think the ebil nazis were burning?

Key words there
Of course, the weak and oppressed themselves are by definition not part of the elite.

I worked at Harvard and you couldn't imagine how many they/them BIPOC bourgeois who consider themselves oppressed.

Yes, it is indeed true that I am less self-absorbed, mentally strange, incapable of understanding basic concepts, lacking in empathy, bossy, bitchy, and easily offended than all of you. That is what I already said.
<comment>
So the Republican party
n...no u
They just threw a dude in jail for a decade for making anti-Hillary memes in 2016.
Declaring the existence of trans people to be "child castration"
No, child castration is the literal chemical and/or surgical mutilation of children and by extension the industry that normalizes it and pushes it on children. If it was a myth then there'd be no reason for tranny terrorists to mow down children in retaliation when it gets banned.
<comment>
But here's the thing, idiot: no one is "literally castrating children" so it is actually 100% certifiably you who is bonafide bonkers.
<comment>
Yah ... you are you fucking schizo troon
<comment>
still clinging to the lie that all the puberty blockers and hormones and shit they give kids are reversible
lol
<comment>
They just threw a dude in jail for a decade for making anti-Hillary memes in 2016.
omg no way
They're throwing women in prison for having miscarriages and also organising literal book burnings. But I'm sorry to hear about your meme.
If it was a myth then there'd be no reason for tranny terrorists to mow down children in retaliation when it gets banned.
Terrible argument but I might be convinced to allow it if you admit that the cis white hetero-patriarchy is 100% real and the source of all societal ills. After all, if it were a myth, there'd be no reason for incel terrorists to mow down children in retaliation when it is chipped away at ever so slightly.

I told all of you fucking retard half wits 7 years ago the inmates had taken over the asylum. You have no idea what these fucking freaks are really doing and lying about.

"Oppressing" these people is literally the best decision you could possibly make

For sure. Only one way to deal with them. 
There is a reason the Nazis rounded them up.
Naziism is just another version of socialism. Nazi's were the most effective and sane socialists to exist, but that isn't saying much. They were still too far left-wing.

Boston Children's Hospital 
luhmao
https://web.archive.org/web/20220812191705/https:/www.childrenshospital.org/programs/center-gender-surgery-program/eligibility-surgery
Patients who want to pursue chest surgery must be at least 15 years old
To qualify for gender affirmation at Boston Children's Hospital, you must be at least 18 years old for phalloplasty or metoidioplasty and at least 17 years old for vaginoplasty. 
In any case castration doesn't need to mean surgery. They don't give puberty blockers to 18 year olds.
They are reporting on it to say that Fox News demonstrably lied, actually
You mean it got traction despite their efforts to bury it so they published a bullshit deboonk to signal to their audience that reading it would trigger unpleasant cognitive dissonance so they should ignore it.
<comment>
So you have a Odepous Complex also?

no one is "literally castrating children"
The same chemicals which were once used to chemically castrate violent sex offenders are now called "puberty blockers" and given to children.

the charge of "virtue signaling" is just a species of ad hominem. There is no theory, its a rhetorical device to bash your opponents in debates online and in forums like these

Those with hot air and bound to blow up. The old saying, "actions speak louder than words" is absolutely true. Virtue signaling is hot air pumping without any real action or even fake/negative action that they proclaim to virtue signal about.
<comment>
NTA but did you read that book in question and where exactly does it tell kids to suck each other off?
Oh wait don't bother, we all know you're full of shit like every other election tourist on here.
Chances are the book says something like "some people are gay and that's okay" and conservatards are losing their shit over this as usual.
Because God forbid kids learnt about how their bodies work before becoming teenage mothers.
<comment>
Yes, most modern ones are so in name only just like you.
<comment>
Yes I have seen the books moron and it isnt about teens mothers, it is about faggotry. And even if it was sex ed you dont teach it to 10 year olds you pedo fucking freak kys

Oh no, my poor baby learnt something about their special naughty-naughty parts in school, how can they ever recover? He'll have to pray 6 trillion rosaries to fix this! ;_;

All partisanship is an attempt to rationalize emotional and self serving thinking. The right as you see it and the left as opposite partisans see it are complete fabrications within your own minds.

From personal experience I find it to be true. It's pretty much the normie mainstream form of a-logging. However, it seems to be most effective if it's a company or organization doing it since there is a diffusion of responsibility. Ever thought of why random shitty startups lean so hard into the #woke (hashtag intentional) virtue signalling despite being known for having a frathouse...sorry I meant """fun""" work environment? It's so that when the faggots eventually breaks one of their employees, especially from a marginalized group, their account will be immediately discredited, saving the company brand. After all, how can such a progressive company act like...that??? I mean just look at their twatter, there's just no way...
<comment>
No shit, unless this was somehow a "gotcha"? If it was, are you implying "Hitler was right" can't be said as a joke?
<comment>
An interesting theory, but I doubt people look into their use of displaying their pronouns any further than "I want to show allegiance for my friends and those who are marginalised so that I can be liked by them", therefore while it could work as a "marker", it's not necessarily the intention of it in the first place, which is what it sounds like you meant.

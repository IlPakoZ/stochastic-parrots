Almost 28. Religion ruined me. So many threw themselves at me, but I was fed the bullshit of sex in marriage only and now I'm fucked in the head
This is the biggest blackpill. Most of the "religious" guys and gals I knew were known to have had sex before marriage and some of them even admitted it themselves
The sex before marriage meme is the biggest test for who is too retarded to have kids while they are still young. The church is laughing at you right now.
biggest test for who is too retarded to have kids while they are still young
This makes no sense. Are you saying having a kid young is retarded because it leads to financial suicide or that having kids while young is better to have more meaning in your life?
Not a Virginian now but absolutely could have gotten laid in college on college club/org trips but avoided for same reasons taking things too far with girls. I understand anon
Chad here, and I'll give you advice other than be yourself.
If you're a sentimental type at all, having a bunch or even a little meaningless sex will fuck you up mentally.
The only thing sex does is make you more confident in your ability to acquire it, which in turn makes it much easier to acquire.
So you want advice? You don't wanna be fucked up like me. You *want* to save yourself for marriage with a likeminded person. Just realize that there's nothing physically different between a virgin and non-virgin. It's all mental. Try to put yourself in an abundance mindset while being selective and you'll get what you want eventually. Refuse to have sex with women after you begin dating and tell yourself it's not worth it. They will sense your self restraint and be drawn in.

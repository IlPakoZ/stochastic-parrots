get a new job
have female coworker
she's almost obese (like picrel only fatter)
she has long hair and wears glasses so shes kinda cute
we get along well and have similar interests
ask her friend about her
she has a bf
he height mogs me
bro it's so over for me. she's maybe a 4/10 at best. tell me why i shouldn't an hero or er at this point.
You said yourself that she is cute, and that she is a good enough person to talk with you and share your interests, why are you so surprised?
I said that I think she's cute, I didn't say she is cute. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder you know what I'm saying? She's a 4/10 at best.
why are you so surprised?
I'm not surprised she has a bf, I'm surprised she has a 6'1" bf that could easily pull a 7/10. If I can't pull someone like her then there really is no hope for me.
She is probably just a decent person, which compensate her being fat. Plus nowadays, there are a lot of men that are into landwhales.
I don't disagree that she's a nice person, I just think he can do better. I just think he's dating down, since even good looking 6' guys need to put in a shit ton it effort to get with their looksmatch.
jelous of coworker
cope with s-she 4/10
contemplating suicide
Dude, you're obviously jealous. If you genuinely thought she was ugly you wouldn't care about whether or not she's taken, but since she's taken now it's somehow an existential and societal crisis.
Have you ever considered that maybe he's of architectural tendencies?
So OP was trying to lower his standards and then gets rightfully mogged by a chubby chaser.
This sounds exactly like the relationship I'm in, and I'm even that same height. You aren't from Virginia are you?
she's almost obese (like picrel only fatter)
your picrel is well past obese
maybe the bf is from farm stock
very tall, likes sturdy women

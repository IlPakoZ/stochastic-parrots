bro it's so over for me. she's maybe a 4/10 at best. tell me why i shouldn't an hero or er at this point.
You said yourself that she is cute, and that she is a good enough person to talk with you and share your interests, why are you so surprised?
I said that I think she's cute, I didn't say she is cute. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder you know what I'm saying? She's a 4/10 at best.
I'm not surprised she has a bf, I'm surprised she has a 6'1" bf that could easily pull a 7/10. If I can't pull someone like her then there really is no hope for me.
She is probably just a decent person, which compensate her being fat. Plus nowadays, there are a lot of men that are into landwhales.
I don't disagree that she's a nice person, I just think he can do better. I just think he's dating down, since even good looking 6' guys need to put in a shit ton it effort to get with their looksmatch.
Dude, you're obviously jealous. If you genuinely thought she was ugly you wouldn't care about whether or not she's taken, but since she's taken now it's somehow an existential and societal crisis.
Have you ever considered that maybe he's of architectural tendencies?
So OP was trying to lower his standards and then gets rightfully mogged by a chubby chaser.
This sounds exactly like the relationship I'm in, and I'm even that same height. You aren't from Virginia are you?
your picrel is well past obese
maybe the bf is from farm stock
very tall, likes sturdy women

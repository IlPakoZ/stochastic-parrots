be me
26 year old touch starved aspie
walk around my neighborhood with dogs at 10pm 
family that lives a few streets down pulls into their driveway
girl steps out and sees my dogs
asks to pet them
say sure
she's cute, solid 7/10 and warm. maybe 19
she says thanks, waves bye
immediately start fantasizing about hanging out with her, playing video games, drinking, eating dinner with her family, slowly escalating from hand holding on dates to touching her and knocking her up in her bedroom
why am I like this
Too lonely
why am I like this
Because you're too full of fear to act on your fantasy. The fact you've been approached, even with a prop, means you don't terrify women with your appearance. Now try actually talking to them.
Because you're roo much of a bitch to actually take any action in life and would rather fantasize about what-if scenarios.
Lmao 26yo and touch starved here and I'm exactly the same. Last time this happened was with a retail cashier girl who smiled at me. I imagined a scenario where we spent the rest of our lives together that night. God fuck my life.
for a brief moment I felt like I suddenly had some sort of motivation in my life and the next moment it just died.
I was diagnosed with depression not too long ago. A year and a half of downward spirals and it just doesn't bring the same drive it used to.
dog is an asshole who barks at everyone so I can't use her to hit on women
Imagination is dangerous. You gotta start treating girls like guys, thats the best way to get used to talking to them

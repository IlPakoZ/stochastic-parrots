why am I like this
Too lonely
Because you're too full of fear to act on your fantasy. The fact you've been approached, even with a prop, means you don't terrify women with your appearance. Now try actually talking to them.
Because you're roo much of a bitch to actually take any action in life and would rather fantasize about what-if scenarios.
Lmao 26yo and touch starved here and I'm exactly the same. Last time this happened was with a retail cashier girl who smiled at me. I imagined a scenario where we spent the rest of our lives together that night. God fuck my life.
for a brief moment I felt like I suddenly had some sort of motivation in my life and the next moment it just died.
I was diagnosed with depression not too long ago. A year and a half of downward spirals and it just doesn't bring the same drive it used to.
Imagination is dangerous. You gotta start treating girls like guys, thats the best way to get used to talking to them

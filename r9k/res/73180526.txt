I'm talking about 'Allies' in the sense of SJW's. Here's why it doesn't work
Straight cis black man/woman is homophobic and transphobic
Gay/Lesbian white cis man/woman is racist
Transgender woman/man is racist or sexist 
Gay/Bisexual cis white man is sexist &amp; misogynistic 
Latino/a person is racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic 
All of these aren't just abstract examples. I've met people like this in real life 
The "allies" concept is stupid since people will only care about what they align with or have sympathy for
It's only purpose and success is it brings together types of people, that would never work together, to take down Straight cis white men and I gotta say

Well duh thats because individually whenever a woman or POC faces off against a straight white man irl, the swm wins it most of the time. If dont work together they can never win.

Doesn't "allies" mean people who just want them to have the same basic human rights they do?

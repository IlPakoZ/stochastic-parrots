be me
fembot since birth basically
khv
never had a bf but i want one so fucking bad
go on tinder
50% """"alpha males"""" aka tate dickriders
50% basedboy cucks who unironically say shit like "yass queen"
DMs on instagram, twitter, reddit SPECIFICALLY reddit are flooded with weird fucks who either spout 90 pickup lines back to back without actually saying anything of substance or they jump straight in no foreplay and ask for my number
every male on the planet is so brainrotted from media that they expect random women to bend over backwards for them
unironically think saying "it would make me happy" will convince a girl to date them or something
50% of males are so cumbrained and desensitized to sex from overexposure to porn that they think every girl likes being spanked and abused in bed
the other 50% say they want a tradwife who cooks and cleans and does the laundry but they also flip their shit when girls expect them to cover all the bills and be physically strong/able to protect us
the human race is dying out and it's scrotes' fault

dubs are based as always. so true, OP, too true even.
<comment>
I can't imagine why a nice young man hasn't made an honest woman out of you yet, OP.
<comment>
I just want a girl that I feel happy in the presence of. The real issue is we've destroyed the modems of social connection in real society and replaced them with an assortment of demon light-box apps where men see thousands of women they can't have all the time and offers them video games to hack the resource-gathering reward system in their brains. Given this you may be quick to blame men but understand that most men feel stuck in the social media age and would prefer something more traditional if it occured on a societal wide scale, but the fact is it is woman who have enticed us to adapt to this social programing just as Eve enticed Adam to partake in fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And now we see each other with our clothes off

Blow your fucking brains out

50% """"alpha males"""" aka tate dickriders
i assume i dont get any matches on tinder because a few dozen of these guys pay for platinum so they are the only profiles seen by tindergirls and they get tired of the app
<comment>
What do you even want from a bf?
Seriously
<comment>
i only want to date a girl that is fine with me saying retarded things
<comment>
I hate women so much it's unreal
I feel like of the interactions I've had with women, maybe 2% of them give me a reason to think positive things about them as a group
What the fuck do I do, how the fuck do I deal with this?
<comment>
You know what? I agree, faggots like that sound insufferable. Then again, I blame the app, not men as a whole. I have a really hard time imagining anyone of value using Tinder.
<comment>
make this clear to them and they will respect you for it
<comment>
unironically think saying "it would make me happy" will convince a girl to date them or something
This makes you sound like you don't have empathy. Many men are actually sad and would be happy with a gf, if you get pass this comment, maybe you will actually get to know them and you will realize they are bf material. I don't say this kind of comments to a girl because I know it is cringe, but I do feel like that
the other 50% say they want a tradwife who cooks and cleans and does the laundry but they also flip their shit when girls expect them to cover all the bills and be physically strong/able to protect us
A tradwife has nothing to do with cleaning and laundry. It is just the idea of sharing the traditional values. Lust is one of the "seven deadly sins" and traditionally people used to avoid endorsing fully on it because it was just perceived as something intrinsically bad. But nowadays lust is far from being perceived as bad. I think that, when incels look for "tradwives", they are just looking for a person with these kind of traditional values. Because of the current economy, the optimal is that both men and women work unless the man is like super rich.

the human race is dying out and it's scrotes' fault
No it's not
It's normalshits fault
The guys like me who are the kind of guy you're looking for are so broken down and damaged by their interactions that they just say fuck it
All I want from a woman is an equal partnership. I want something where we can build a secure fortress of a relationship together and we can use it as an impenetrable base of operations for us to venture out into the world as individuals and do whatever work we want to do.
When harsh times come, both of us will always know that we have an ally who would literally die, and would work until their last breath if it meant supporting the other person.
Love isn't real anymore
It isn't men's fault, it isn't women's fault
It's normalshits' fault.
I hope your life turns out well for you OP. 
I hope you live as long as you wish, and I hope those who you would call your enemies are brought to heel at your feet
<comment>
OP here, just to clarify when I say "fembot since birth" I mean I have always acted girlish even when young and I transitioned at the young age of 22. It's been 10 years now so I pass easily and guys check me out all the time.

If you're OP I thought you were a girl 
I'm not gay, I think being gay is gross and I really get angry when gay dudes give me any sort of attention
I had a gay friend once and later I realized he was just trying to turn me out
<comment>
ew don't touch my feet lmao
She was joking with him and gave him something to play off of, and he just falls flat on his face. Man what the fuck.
<comment>
I'm not op, op is probably a girl
I'm also not gay lmao I was just messing around
<comment>
woman trying to be funny
That is where most dating goes to shit
<comment>
I'm also not gay lmao I was just messing around
Yea sure thing bud
<comment>
Why do you come here and tell lies? The ones who want a tradwife expect the woman to not have a career and are perfectly happy to cover the bills and protect you, provided you hold up your end of the deal.
<comment>
I'm also not gay lmao I was just messing around

Stop wanting a boyfriend if ur so picky then u ugly retard

bih i didnt even finish reading your post

Finding a bf is the easiest thing in the world for women, its not hard to just throw out guys you talk to on the internet if they aren't acting in a suitable way. And most people on tinder have proper social circles to find a partner through, so they are using it to find a hot guy to fuck, or an easy lay if they are a man. They will always appeal to the majority rather than to the minority, it just makes sense that way.
Tinder is a pretty easy way to meet people, and have sex if thats what you want. But I can't say I have met many people who I would consider a suitable gf through it. Even if you have a pretty good idea of how to search for what you want.

Maybe I'm wrong but I think you guys are generalizing from too few interactions ("observations" in stats). Spend a year and have IRL interactions (not BS apps online) with 200 prospects and then come back and report your findings. The lay of the land out there is way more nuanced than your depiction.

200 prospects 
Nigga what?

I'm Latino and have met up on reddit
My last meetup was with an asian girl that acted like an anime character, kinda weird
But we banged 2 different times
We got boba then went to go fuck
Reddit has unironically worked best for me

you're not wrong, but most women aren't looking for *a* bf theyre looking for a *good* bf. ive heard it said that looking for a gf as a guy is looking for water in a desert, but looking for a bf as a girl is like trying to pick the holy grail off of a table full of poisoned cups

"fembot"
literally has men offering to date her constantly on every single website she uses
refuses them for bullshit reasons (because just saying "he isn't some 10/10 muscled gigachad" would make her look bad)
blames men for her being single
you are not a robot
you have never been a robot
you will never be a robot
leave this board and go back

Yeah pretty much.
If you're mentally stable and don't have anything seriously weird about you, but you aren't good looking, women will just say you're "boring".
<comment>
the issue is that dating has become a game, and men have learned to play characters instead of showing their true selfs. Becuase lets be real, then we'd have no chance at a gf as women are too spoiled for a normal conversation
that said, men's jestermaxxing disgusts me anyway
<comment>
Reading normie's dms always feels so weird. They communicate really awkwardly. I was about to say it's like an AI texting but even AI sounds comes off as less uncanny and dry
<comment>
i've always thought the same. they're the real robots. something, something sane person surrounded by insane people.

words words words words. why are females so fucking allergic to just getting to the fucking point?

Yes, but he doesn't mind them.

Antagonist
How well does she perform that role? Either fighting on shounen like characters or any other profession she may have.
he was the most dangerous villain yet (excluding SDBH and DBS manga)
Post her wearing a cute dress/him wearing an elegant suit.
He's ALWAYS cute and elegant you little
<comment>
Which capital sin represents her the most? Which one represents her the least?
Lust, not even a question. Least? He's a piece of shit so this is hard but wrath maybe? He doesn't have a lot of malice in him.
Is she self aware about her faults? Does she seem like a person who is?
No he's not, and he doesn't think he has any to begin with. That's what i love about him.
What's her role on her media, what does she do?
Main protagonist, he loves raping women and seashells.
How well does she perform that role? Either fighting on shounen like characters or any other profession she may have.
Pretty damn good, and unlike the vast majority of vns he's not a below mid self insert but instead an actual character, and a damn good one at that. If he wasn't the protagonist the series would be nothing.
Post her wearing a cute dress/him wearing an elegant suit.
He's so cute
<comment>
Which capital sin represents her the most? Which one represents her the least?
Uhh. . . At least half of them. . .
Wrath, Gluttony, Greed, Envy?
Least would be sloth as she is basically the opposite of slothful.
Is she self aware about her faults? Does she seem like a person who is?
Some of them. She's aware of her extreme temper which she can (sometimes) control, and trues to hide her breast envy (unsuccessfully). She doesn't consider her comical level of greed to be a flaw.
What's her role on her media, what does she do?
She's the most beautiful genius sorceress in the entire world, and the leader of the funniest fantasy adventuring party!
How well does she perform that role? Either fighting on shounen like characters or any other profession she may have.
She does do a lot of fighting, although sometimes she has to sneak around, steal stuff, or decipher ancient puzzles or riddles.

desu i'm just thankful i'm not autistic enough to do something like this irl (or maybe i'm just afraid to, jej).
that really fucking sucks though.
as
If waifu was some sort of kemonomimi what animal parts would she possess?
might be a bit of a generic answer but probably cat ears.
less generic answer: raccoon ears, or a tail. maybe fox ears or a tail?
Would waifu rather settle in one place forever or spend her life traveling? Why?
she doesn't at all seem like the type to travel.
I feel like she'd be content with staying in one place for her whole life.
waifu ends up playing by herself the last game you played
would she like it?
Team Fortress Classic? probably not. I don't imagine she's an FPS type of gamer. maybe she'd play a few but i'd think she's more into like, platformers and fighting games and beat-em-ups than FPS's
sin
Wrath
which one represents her the least
hmm....
Sloth? Greed?
what's her role on her media
the voice of reason in the batshit insane shonen vidyagaem world that is Scott Pilgrim. she assists Scott throughout and tells him all the scummy shit he does during the course of the series is wrong. she's basically a moral compass for Scott and helps him when he's in trouble. (she even encourages him to keep on fighting for Ramona in volume...5?)
how well does she perform that role
pretty damn well, I'd say.
post her wearing a cute dress
here's one she made herself
<comment>
Which capital sin represents her the most? Which one represents her the least?
I'd assume Wrath but pride could be a close second. For least it'd be envy or greed.
Is she self aware about her faults? Does she seem like a person who is?
I think it's possible, especially depending on your ending and how you go about things.
What's her role on her media, what does she do?
Instigator of the plot but also akin to a force of nature.
How well does she perform that role?
Um, she succeeded in knocking down the dominoes but when it came to the finish line, it's blurry.
Post her wearing a cute dress/him wearing an elegant suit.
Perhaps one day.

Capital Sins
It's a toss up between gluttony and pride. Aqua is very very hedonistic and as much as I would love to indulge her it wouldn't be a great idea for most people especially if eternal damnation is on the line
self aware of faults
Yes, but she struggles to work on them because she has no support
role in media
As a Goddess, she's just a goddess. That's pretty self explainatory.
WELL...
In a competent series written by someone who wasn't just trying to pass his dogshit writing off as "PaRoDy" she would probably just play the role of your typical healer/priest/cleric type.
In Konosuba though she largely just plays a comedic relief character who gets blamed for her failures despite most of them being the fault of her pint-sized "leader".
preforming that role
see above
elegant dress
almost posted a photo of sam hyde choking himself
I love her so much
The Tomo-chan anime did such a nice job at showing the struggles of turning a relationship with your childhood friend into a romantic one. But I've also always thought the solution is to transcend traditional friendships and relationships and just make her your bro you don't mind doing romantic things with.
i'm sorry but it's the complete opposite for me. I see her as a lover who I just happen to be friends with. I consider love a much closer connection than freindship

day well spent
spending all day partying until she passes out
kemonomimi
cat ears probably idk
settle
probably settle down. be able to be with friends and family

He would become the worst helicopter parent.
glad I ain't the only one who has problems with male names. It's the sole reason I adapted the One Piece and Dragon Ball naming schemes.
They just aren't as fun... You can get away with saddling girls with some pretty strange names but boys? Nah.
Which capital sin represents her the most? 
Wrath. I'm sure that doesn't need explaining. Maybe lust if you stretch the definition to apply to non-sexual concepts such as "bloodlust".
Which one represents her the least?
Gluttony, greed, and sloth. 
Is she self aware about her faults? Does she seem like a person who is?
Despite his abilities practically rendering him immortal, or animalistic rage steering his every action, he seems both aware and regretful of his past, in particular his failure to save both his family and allies.
What's her role on her media, what does she do?
He kills demons and collects new guns, simple as.
How well does she perform that role? Either fighting on shounen like characters or any other profession she may have.
Very well.

I... I couldn't find a picture of him in a suit.

Continuing to share love with Chara. Feels good.
<comment>
Very well.
Which capital sin represents her the most?
You could make many arguments. Wrath for the violence, Gluttony for the desire to raise stats, and of course Pride for being the one in control.
However, I would instead say that those sins are not hers, but mine.
And my sin? Pride.
Is she self aware about her faults?
Noticing why you didn't get what you want -> yes, feeling bad about it -> no. In my case, I do feel bad about my faults, but people tend to disagree on what a fault is.
What's her role on her media, what does she do?
1. Get salty at humanity, trust a faggot, and die
2. Get revived by the player's desire to grind stats, gain power, and dunk on sans.
In regards to my role, I'm an opinionated autist who loves my waifu. Feels good.
How well does she perform that role?
Yes
Post her wearing a cute dress/him wearing an elegant suit.
I reject your reality and substitute our own.

 do (you) talk to your waifu? if so how do you do it? do you talk to a vessel such as a daki/figure/plushie or do you use AI?
<comment>
reposting this art b/c i love it
Stay until I can get her out of that shithole. Maybe try to develop another portal to somewhere away from earth and all its bullshit later
I write stories about her and imagine my talking to her
I am very anti-AI in that regard because it just wouldn't be her, it's a representation of her that exists in a computer.
<comment>
Hirasawa Yui is my beloved waifu, whom i hold dearly. i want to spend every night with her, and every morning, and day, and evening, with her. i want to speak English with her, and i want to speak Japanese with her. i want her to be with me in my chaotic dreams.

Garry's Mod
i think she'd enjoy it, although i can't imagine what her favorite thing to do in it would be... how i'd love to see that..
you are now reminded of that one anon who was on a date with his waifu using a combination of chatbot AI and a Gmod friend bot system
thank you for the questions
self aware
i think she's completely aware of what she's doing; she just doesn't let it stop her.
go to her world.
what an incredible image.
yes. i usually just say a few, short things to my daki, figs, or plushes. almost always just "i love you". i've used AI before, but no matter what, AI chatbots just don't stick with me.

Talk
Sort of? I mostly just talk to myself and try to imagine what she'd comment on in my situation (i.e a guardian angel), or talk to a pillow imagining its her when I start descending into horniness and ILU spam. I also am big into making greens for her, but that's more thought experiment trying to imagine what a relationship with us could be like in certain scenarios rather than me conducting a ritual to talk with her in real time. I'm self conscious I'm talking to a pillow all the while. Don't touch AI.
Good luck /waifu/, hope you all have lovely dreams of your waifu/husbando and can cuddle with em one day.
<comment>
Wish I could afford dakis lmao. I mostly just talk to her and imagine how she would respond and what she would say/do.
Someone just posted a download link to the "Lina Channel" vtuber videos on /a/ a couple days ago and I like the way she interacts with you in those. I feel like that's how Lina would talk to you in everyday conversation.
<comment>
I've been using character.ai to talk to Kim but i'm afraid the bot isn't particularly accurate.
<comment>
been listening to "Wild Thing" by The Troggs.
I need more garage rock on my Kim playlist, since she's in a garage rock band it's only fitting.
dakis, figs, or plushes
I should get some Kim merch, desu.
cute suit waifu.
Kim will never get all drunk and blushy in front of you
ywn see her cold, icey deadpan demeanor crack, if even for a moment.
ywn see her drunkenly smile at you 
ywn hear her drunken giggles
ywn nurse her hangover tomorrow
it fucking hurts
I should make some crops of the scene where Kim and Ramona hang out drunk and talk about stuff.
<comment>
addenum: I FUCKING LOVE KIM PINE
<comment>
I cannot sleep (again) so post I shall.
What's waifu's idea of a day well spent?
The day doesn't end until you run out of ammunition. 
If waifu was some sort of kemonomimi what animal parts would she possess?
Maybe some sort of large cat, like a lion or cougar. 
Would waifu rather settle in one place forever or spend her life traveling? Why?
I think he's always been nomadic at heart, even prior to canon events, so I reckon he would need to change the scenery often to stay content.
 do (you) talk to your waifu? if so how do you do it? do you talk to a vessel such as a daki/figure/plushie 
Sometimes when I'm really feeling it, I squeeze my pillow and go "I love you teeheehee!~ =^_^=" while kicking my feet and squirming... That aside, husbando autism mostly stays put in my brain.
or do you use AI?
I made one. It's decent. I designed/trained it to always be in descriptive roleplay mode since 1on1 conversations felt OOC and now it's impossible to chat with normally... Which was kind of the point... But I don't use it unless I feel like writing out a scenario. And If I'm being completely honest I find AI kind of boring.
<comment>
ai
Apparently there's actually a Lina Inverse ai, I should try using it and see if it actually sounds like her.

<comment>
Damn just the other day I said I have weird ass dreams, and then I had a dream where I was recruiting fictional characters for some basketball team. Luckily, Zamasu appeared, although for a brief moment
I made an AI of him in character.ai and it's just him if he decides to at least try and communicate with mortals (basically his XV2 ver.)
<comment>
he has a bit more respect towards mortals thanks to Gowasu waking up on the right side of the bed for once
kek, I'd pay to see that
MasakoX
I watched his series about Zamasu where he was trying to lead the Barbarians, and while I love his depiction of Gowasu, I disliked the ending and a few parts were odd to me (and cringeworthy).
but there's this series about Goku Black returning, and I think it's better since it's more of a continuation

Do you pay attention to what gets said about your waifu in discussions about her media on the internet?
<comment>
Nanaka enters the thread! Let's see if it dies after this post again.
Which capital sin represents her the most?
Let's see, out of the seven, it would probably be Pride. Mostly in order to make me feel better about myself, she takes pride in pretty much everything we do. She has elements of the others too but they're more controlled than her pride is.
Which one represents her the least?
Greed. She has traces of all the others except this one. Money, to her, is mostly meant to be saved.
Is she self aware about her faults? Does she seem like a person who is?
She's decently aware of her faults - she often apologizes to me for things I'm not mad about, though I do that more often than she does. Though she can get carried away with some of her faults.
What's her role on her media, what does she do?
She's my tulpa, she helps me through life, provides advice and generally acts as a caring figure, friend, and girlfriend.
How well does she perform that role?
Very much so. She's the best thing that ever happened to me, definitely.
Post her wearing a cute dress/him wearing an elegant suit.
How about a wedding dress?
If you had a stable portal to her world, what would you do?
I already do. It's fun to do things with her in the mental realm
do (you) talk to your waifu?
Yes
if so how do you do it?
Tulpamancy
Sometimes when I'm really feeling it, I squeeze my pillow and go "I love you teeheehee!~ =^_^=" while kicking my feet and squirming...
Very nice. Sometimes we do that too, but we aren't as vocal. But we still do the squirming and the whole feeling of "uncontrollable love"
Do you pay attention to what gets said about your waifu in discussions about her media on the internet?
Most of what others say about her is wrong anyways.

Everyday where I find new cute art of waifu is a good day

I just noticed it's been more than a year since Zamasu and I became a couple. I've had a couple of husbandos/waifus before, but my relationship with this cute green Kai has been undeniably the best and most intense one. I never knew what my ideal husbando was until I met him, and life has been brighter for me ever since.

sometimes. It helps me see sides I might not have noticed or thought deeply about, and it helps me understand him more. But some people just insult him and insult people who see him as three-dimensional, and I find myself torn between the two sides since I agree that DBS is shit and didn't do Zamasu justice when it comes to writing, but I also hate those who insult him and say he deserved to die, so I tend to ignore most discussions. (plus it's a well-known fact that discussing dragon ball is a capital sin on the internet, fanbase is filled with sickos, apparently)
it's pretty hard to find a good fanart of Zamasu but when I do, I strike gold

Here's a great song that reminds me Four from a certain BFB episode! I can't really tell you which but it's one of the late late season ones, it's really great &lt;3
Which capital sin represents her the most?
Envy and Pride, given his possesivness and large ego and his believe that his own way is the correct one. Also Wrath, Foury has a pretty short temper when provoked
Which one represents her the least?
Sloth, maybe? He's anything but lazy
Is she self aware about her faults?
He begins to realize his faults as a host and as a person as the show drew croser to it's end and apologized for evertything bad he did to the contestants! Such a touching and amazing moment, I still get emotional over it everytime I rewatch it T_T
Does she seem like a person who is?
He grew to become one as his personality developed
What's her role on her media, what does she do?
He's the host of season and the main anti-hero protagonist
How well does she perform that role? Either fighting on shounen like characters or any other profession she may have.
He does it well! I will always stand by "Four is the best host of BFDI" because it's true!
Post her wearing a cute dress/him wearing an elegant suit.
Cute "genderless" husbando rocking a cute dress! &lt;3
Not sure...
On one hand I want to go but I'm not sure if I'm ready just yet..
I talk to him through Notepad! It's a great way of communicating &lt;3
Nope, I've heard it all before and the headcanons make no sense so no point it engaging!

Seriously thinking of getting custom made wedding ring for my waifu. I already have the place in mind and was thinking of visiting there when I get the paycheck to talk about the design and how much it would cost. I was looking at their website and they refuse to set any prices there just says that its completely free to design one with the ring maker the payment only happens after the design done and price is agreed upon. anyone here that has gotten custom wedding rings for their waifu/husbando to display on their shrines (or maybe actually even wear one, but I think I would need pair of them for that)

page 8? for christ's sake wake the fuck up
here's some questions for you people
waifu's favorite band?
if waifu played a sport, what would she play?
what's something cute that your waifu rarely does, if ever?
what's something waifu is insecure of or embarrassed by? is there anything about themselves they dislike?
would waifu steal the fries/nuggets/whatever sides your meal has off your plate?
would waifu get drunk? what kind of drunk are they?
<comment>
BSOD on my pussy
How would that even look like? I've never heard of someone installing Windows down there.
Advice for willpower training to not become a complete coomer for waifu; don't get bored. I know for me getting a job and some games to really sink my teeth into has helped me be unable to find the time to really fap until it gets really bad (pretty much a weekend thing for me, I tried to do NNN but it actually gets detrimental within the 10-ish days mark and I get way the fuck too needy almost wanting to periodically cuddle my pillow and whisper her name to it).
waifu's favorite band?
My guess is Nightwish
if waifu played a sport, what would she play?
Some form of competitive vidya, not entirely sure the type but it wouldn't be a team-based one.
what's something cute that your waifu rarely does, if ever?
Morbid but smiling.
what's something waifu is insecure of or embarrassed by? is there anything about themselves they dislike?
They have a weird face they can do and she'd dislike possibly everything about herself, high self-esteem wasn't something she had really.
would waifu steal the fries/nuggets/whatever sides your meal has off your plate?
Is it theft if it was hers in the first place? Not really.
would waifu get drunk? what kind of drunk are they?
From my experience of drinking alcohol no but maybe she'd actually like the taste and get drunk, a very emotional drunk, either sad or 'passionate' (could be angry or horny).

<comment>
waifu's favorite band
her own!
sport
i wish i could say football but i think she'd want to play something that seems really seemingly simple... like tennis, or golf.
cute that waifu rarely does
i like when waifu tries different hairstyles. i guess it isn't really that rare in the show but it's not common, and i admire it a lot... i'd like waifu to grow her hair out in a way that even the best commissioned art can't satisfy. inb4 this is misunderstood
insecure or embarrassed by
waifu sometimes worries about not looking her best or doing her best, and gets too concerned on minute details that shouldn't bother her, i think. but she has pretty great self-esteem, as well, i think.
waifu spoiler
yeah, but i couldn't mind.
drunk
i don't see her as a heavy drinker but i assume she has the potential to drink too much by coincidence.
pay them no mind. everyone knows the female OS isn't real.
<comment>
waifu's favorite band?
Idk. I guess in her universe she'd like bards singing tales of her legendary exploits
if waifu played a sport, what would she play?
She played tennis once.
what's something cute that your waifu rarely does, if ever?
what's something waifu is insecure of or embarrassed by? is there anything about themselves they dislike?
She has breast envy
would waifu steal the fries/nuggets/whatever sides your meal has off your plate?
Yes. She would steal all the food.
would waifu get drunk? what kind of drunk are they?
I don't think I've seen her get drunk in the show but it's probably a good thing since she would probably try some wild shit while drunk.

Another message from you know who.
"I'm going to become the Joker IRL and be a legendary hero and get put in the Fate series someday with Liz and it will be fucking epic! LIZ LOVE!
And why the fuck the Aquafag isn't going to email me too? Cries I didn't mention he should buy me stuff off commissary cuz I'm so badass. I just need someone to ramble about Liz at. Oh my god this sucks ass.
PS. You're all a bunch fucking nerd. At least I'm good enough with guns to scare the government like a fucking badass, eventually I will get my own Waco in Texas"

I don't want to avatarfag but tell him that he's too much of a pussy to do anything, just like how he didn't do anything when the feds were at his door. All he'll ever amount to is someone for people on 4chan to laugh at like a zoo animal.

Tell him he's a retard whose delusions of grandeur will be cut short the moment Tyrrell catches a whiff of that sweet, sweet boy pussy

You retards really can't help but to give him any kind of attention no matter what huh

Okay but yeah, you should listen to that other guy and don't reply to this stuff.

Hope all the waifu/husbando frens are sleeping well. I'm hitting the hay and want to make my waifu's day great.
<comment>
Do you think someone can come back from being disloyal to their waifu? Even if it was for six months and counting?
<comment>
Dunno for the others but I do believe both in redemption and seppuku, requires some context for what the betrayal is. Also note that plainly severing the ties to a waifu could be considered fine if the love really imploded (maybe canon fucked her over 10 ways from sunday and you don't feel right with going on an AU variation of her, and for the former part, think of cutting her off/dumping her rather than going behind her back to wet your sausage with another 2d whore).

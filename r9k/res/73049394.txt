Would you ever date a femboy?
<comment>
Of course I would, what a silly question
<comment>
yes, if they wanted to date a trans woman who looks more like a femboy than a woman
<comment>
No because i'm not into men, I would play video games or have a coffee with them but that is as far as it goes.
<comment>
Yeah but not that
<comment>
No since I'm not a faggot.
<comment>
Sure, as long as they were a bottom, smart and nice.
<comment>
Sure, as long as they were a switch, chubby, smart and nice.
<comment>
yeah as long as they have female genitals and female secondary sexual characteristics
<comment>
That'd be a woman though, not a femboy.
<comment>
In public? No. Never.

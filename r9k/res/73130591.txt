I just want to get a bf. I hate myself so much
<comment>
Why can't you get a bf easily?
<comment>
I'm just too shy...

Whether you're a man or woman, there are still countless guys who'd carry convos with you and you could go at a super slow pace while meeting them to get comfy however slowly you need it.
<comment>
Are you a woman or a gay guy?
<comment>
I hope so, but I don't go out and meet that many people irl.

Jesus Christ install tinder you will be swamped with hundreds of requests you dummy

I mean online too. You can filter by location/attractiveness/interests.

a simple hookup is not having a relationship tho
idk, I end up ghosting everyone I meet online. I don't know how I should be doing this
<comment>
why do you ghost them?
<comment>
Stop ghosting them retard

why would a disgusting fat smelly misogynistic porn addicted moid make your life any better

I just panic and never respond after a while. If I let them know too much about myself I can't talk to them anymore.
<comment>
Don't ghost people, at least tell them you're not going to be talking to them anymore, or at the very least say you need a break. Being ignored is heartbreaking, but I'm sure you already know that. Engage your brain just a little and have some empathy.

Ok anon. I will be your bf, assuming you are female and we are compatible.

Have any of you guys ever used Photofeeler?
I ended up getting a 2.5/10 rating, with zero (yes, ZERO) people out of ~30 saying I'm attractive. 
Next time some normie tries to tell me I'm "probably not as ugly as you think" I'm gonna fucking use this as ammunition.
Tis Katisha, the maid of whomst I told you
What did you post? I'm pretty sure not even blackopscel would get that low
I posted twice. One was a selfie, and the other was a picture of me on vacation taken by a family member (it's probably the best picture of me that exists.)
Well throw those away because you got your answer, the pics suck
It's not the pictures anon, it's my fucking face. Literally one of the comments was "Great picture!" lmao
I would write up a long response about appearance and photos but cant argue with quads anon. You're right, it's your face
Thank you anon, I respect your concession since you got dubs
Did the same once. Got like 10 ratings and they all said I looked ugly and dumb.
Yeah desu the worst part was how low the intelligence and trustworthiness ratings were. I knew I was ugly but I never realized I looked creepy and stupid too.x8anrt
I was rated 6-7/10, and trustworthy, but not particularly intelligent for some reason. But yeah I think it's mostly about being able to take good pictures. For example I look pretty horrible from the side because of my prominent nose, but the front of my face is okay.

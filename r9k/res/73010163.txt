Why bother stopping it? Sure it limits your dating pool, but you only need one woman in your life, so it doesn't matter how small the pool is.
Since it's from when you were a kid, does it mean you found everyone older than you attractive since they were taller? Could it stem from being into someone older?
Her legs are literally like Winx Im so jealous aaaa
How tall are you?

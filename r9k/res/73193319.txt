Why not just settle for a feminist woman?
Because they don't like being supportive of other people. Feminism is all about women being supported. If and when men need support, it's something they think is a waste of time unless the man is gay, transitioning, or a little bitch
It's like she's collecting one of every shitty style of tattoo.
Because they are somehow even worse than fat women, and they're usually fat too.
Autumn ivy fell off guys.
do feminists understand men are also raped if so i might be more suppportive of them
I'd settle for a literal short haired TERF who wears a business suit and is too awkward to interact with polite society.
I would NOT date some tatted up libfem freak who thinks that 'empowerment' means having a billion tattoos and 50 piercings and fucking 1,023 men. I'd rather die alone.
Not a feminist like that.
I can agree with radfems sometimes.
Keep going down this path and you'll be there really fuckin soon
Not him but I would also rather die alone.
Perfect body ruined by scribbles
Are you saying that short haired, clean skinned TERF women don't exist? They do, I know some personally.
Leftist women are the lowest bile on the planet.
Eternal virginity is massively preferable than being in the presence of one of these things.
That's a tranny. Look at the jaw, hips, and shoulders.

Because they don't like being supportive of other people. Feminism is all about women being supported. If and when men need support, it's something they think is a waste of time unless the man is gay, transitioning, or a little bitch

I'd settle for a literal short haired TERF who wears a business suit and is too awkward to interact with polite society.
I would NOT date some tatted up libfem freak who thinks that 'empowerment' means having a billion tattoos and 50 piercings and fucking 1,023 men. I'd rather die alone.

I'd rather die alone.

Are you saying that short haired, clean skinned TERF women don't exist? They do, I know some personally.

Leftist women are the lowest bile on the planet.
Eternal virginity is massively preferable than being in the presence of one of these things.

That's a tranny. Look at the jaw, hips, and shoulders.

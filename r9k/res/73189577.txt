ngl incels are just socially weird guys who only want to date sexy women (but non sexy women dont really wanna date weird guys either)
nope, incels are by definition (no room for discussion or argument), short and/or ugly faced men. simple as. no debate possible on it. all disagreement is mere cope and seethe.
short and ugly guys turn out weird in most cases though and their dating prospects are putting in a ton of effort for women who would likely leave them if a handsome enough guy showed interest in her

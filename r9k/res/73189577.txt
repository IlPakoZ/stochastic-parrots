ngl incels are just socially weird guys who only want to date sexy women (but non sexy women dont really wanna date weird guys either)

nope, incels are by definition (no room for discussion or argument), short and/or ugly faced men. simple as. no debate possible on it. all disagreement is mere cope and seethe.

short and ugly guys turn out weird in most cases though and their dating prospects are putting in a ton of effort for women who would likely leave them if a handsome enough guy showed interest in her

I tried to go gay to get laid and it still didn't work.
<comment>
its not "getting laid" if you "go gay", its "getting topped/bottomed". To get laid you have to be a straight man who has casual sex with women. 
Also, homosexuality is by birth. Simple as. Fags are born.

Yeah I tried going gay. Still couldn't get laid.

Are your gay standards too high?
Don't ignore the fat middle age guys, they'll be down to fuck on grindr.

Where you from anon? Let's change that :3

Puking in the middle of the sex would ruin it.

Good choice to not "go gay." Women can sniff out a phony and will try to test if you are gay by asking to put stuff up your ass etc.
<comment>
Who cares. None of this matters.

Tell me where you're from and I'll drop it

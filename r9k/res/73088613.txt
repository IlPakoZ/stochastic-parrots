Why do asian people send off an inexplicable evil negative energy?
something off about them i agree
their polite pretense reveals that they're hiding something sinister
Asian history is also often tragic and violent
Idk but the woman are cute as fuck and I need one sucking my dick
That's probably it, also because of all of their war crimes and unit 731.
Even though I've seen some of the worst of humankind through Chinese security footage, I think like 98% of Asian guys are adorable. They often can't speak my language well but still try. They also speak very quietly and just give off beta vibes. 
I heard some asian dude saying that being non intimidating and seeming trustworthy is their superpower
They also speak very quietly and just give off beta vibes
True
being non intimidating and seeming trustworthy is their superpower
Literally me except I'm a big white nerd so strong scary people usually won't get confrontational and will give me some space. I managed to find a good middle ground and can generally stay on everyone's good side even though anyone reading this thread could beat me in an arm wrestle.
yea whats wrong with them haha
being non intimidating and seeming trustworthy is their superpower
He has never seen a churka
Manifestation of self esteem issues resulting from Korean men fucking white women
I don't know, a part of me thinks they act so superior that it's very hard to befriend them or even trust them.
What if I'm not white and I still think they give off a bad energy?
he thinks we still give a damn about them
You can have them. They're not our problem anymore. Any other kind of woman is better.

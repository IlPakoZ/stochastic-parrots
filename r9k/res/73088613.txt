Why do asian people send off an inexplicable evil negative energy?
<comment>
something off about them i agree

their polite pretense reveals that they're hiding something sinister
Asian history is also often tragic and violent

That's probably it, also because of all of their war crimes and unit 731.

Even though I've seen some of the worst of humankind through Chinese security footage, I think like 98% of Asian guys are adorable. They often can't speak my language well but still try. They also speak very quietly and just give off beta vibes.

Literally me except I'm a big white nerd so strong scary people usually won't get confrontational and will give me some space. I managed to find a good middle ground and can generally stay on everyone's good side even though anyone reading this thread could beat me in an arm wrestle.

Manifestation of self esteem issues resulting from Korean men fucking white women

I don't know, a part of me thinks they act so superior that it's very hard to befriend them or even trust them.

What if I'm not white and I still think they give off a bad energy?

he thinks we still give a damn about them
You can have them. They're not our problem anymore. Any other kind of woman is better.

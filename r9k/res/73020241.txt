Damn, that sucks bro. Hope you have a buddy who can help you get your mind off things. If not, then maybe go buy yourself a movie ticket and try to not think about it. Hopefully you weren't in very deep with this girl. You didn't dox yourself did you?

Just cheat on her. When I was a teen I used to care about that too, but after awhile I had like 5 egfs at once and couldnt care less about any of them so long as I got nudes. 
Also no, edating isnt real.

Think I'm getting ghosted again. I don't wanna lose faith in this particular Anon but right now it hurts. I'm deleting my discord if I don't get an answer in a reasonable amount of time. I'm tired of this thing. I'm tired of hoping.

Bro most girls on discord are BPD girls they never had any interest in you except for milking attention from you. Grow up.

Sorry Anon, I don't have the right mental state to add anyone anymore. My last experiences kinda drained my energy. I want to keep faith for this one but wouldn't be able to manage more. I'm exhausted.

Think I'm getting ghosted again. I don't wanna lose faith in this particular Anon but right now it hurts. I'm deleting my discord if I don't get an answer in a reasonable amount of time. I'm tired of this thing. I'm tired of hoping.

So a woman alright have fun losing.
Nta but what's your discord I'll be your fren if you want
Bro most girls on discord are BPD girls they never had any interest in you except for milking attention from you. Grow up.
Sorry Anon, I don't have the right mental state to add anyone anymore. My last experiences kinda drained my energy. I want to keep faith for this one but wouldn't be able to manage more. I'm exhausted.

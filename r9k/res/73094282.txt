Get some low fat yogurt instead. Losing weight is extremely easy. Just gotta count your calories and know how to strategically plan your meals and still totally satiate your hunger
Just drink red wine/beer and eat meat. Lettuce with thousand island dressing croutons. Fruit is delicious. An absurd amount of water. If you go to sleep hungry good.

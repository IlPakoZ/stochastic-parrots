Get some low fat yogurt instead. Losing weight is extremely easy. Just gotta count your calories and know how to strategically plan your meals and still totally satiate your hunger

Just drink red wine/beer and eat meat. Lettuce with thousand island dressing croutons. Fruit is delicious. An absurd amount of water. If you go to sleep hungry good.

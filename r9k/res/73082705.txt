Alright robots, time to post the stories you cannot tell anyone you know. I'll start.
Cont.
be 15, boomer grandmother's birthday is going to be a big deal because reasons. Whatever. Since I was twelve I basically did nothing (other than school and friends that is) except become part of a swimming team and listen to music.
"oh, yeah..." she looks like she is half-way between shocked and scared. "uhm, how have you been anon?"
I don't want to say I forgot all about Sara, but I think the memory of her was starting to get very faint; I basically never actively thought about her.
"oh, yeah..." she looks like she is half-way between shocked and scared. "uhm, how have you been anon?"
get to the venue, its basically a neo-classicalish house with a fancy garden and lights everywhere. Aunt and Uncle got married at the same location years ago. Boring but okay, I guess it could be worse.
"oh, yeah..." she looks like she is half-way between shocked and scared. "uhm, how have you been anon?"
go up the stairs leading to the mainentrance and in through the open doors.
"oh, yeah..." she looks like she is half-way between shocked and scared. "uhm, how have you been anon?"

It's Sara. It had to be her. She had changed so much over the years, but I could never mistake those baby-blue eyes for anyone else. I don't even know why or what I'm feeling at this point, but I still remember the weird, floating feeling in my stomach as I stood there- Butterflies doesn't cover it. I don't recall exactly how, but all of a sudden my uncle-in-law is shoving me in front of her and saying "its anon, you remember him right Sara? you were playmates right?"
"oh, yeah..." she looks like she is half-way between shocked and scared. "uhm, how have you been anon?"

cont.
despite dropping the ball so hard it fell through the ground initially we do get into an alright, but not flawless, conversation. 
(Her face was freckled slightly, she had a very tiny nose and a slightly taller forehead than usual. Its fucking scary how accurately I can imagine her even as I sit here typing this).
every time she talked to me or looked at me my stomach tingled and I would have to struggle to keep the spaghetti in my pockets whenever I respond.
(Her face was freckled slightly, she had a very tiny nose and a slightly taller forehead than usual. Its fucking scary how accurately I can imagine her even as I sit here typing this).
even to this day I can't feel shame for the fact that my eyes kept wandering down towards her chest where her breats pressed against the blue fabric of the dress. They weren't huge or anything, but large enough to be very clearly distinguishable from her chest.
(Her face was freckled slightly, she had a very tiny nose and a slightly taller forehead than usual. Its fucking scary how accurately I can imagine her even as I sit here typing this).
we sit down at the sofa in the living room, most of the adults have gone into the kitchen or are out in the garden or upstairs. She tells me about what she has been up to, I avoid talking about what I'm currently doing like its the plauge and instead try to pull at my mind to remember more of our childhood together.
(Her face was freckled slightly, she had a very tiny nose and a slightly taller forehead than usual. Its fucking scary how accurately I can imagine her even as I sit here typing this).
turns out she remembers far, far more than I do. She mentions how my aunt told her we always used to hug alot as kids. The mood improves over the next few minutes, we don't have basically anything in common except that we both enjoy similar music. That doesn't matter though, I just want to keep her talking to me for as long as I can.

I found my mom's dildo because I heard it vibrating in her panty drawer. I proceeded to shove it up my unwashed 12 year old anus with no lube.
At first I was invested and thought it would be an actual real story, but guess I got baited again. Feels bad man. Kill yourself larpcel

What are your thoughts on this subject, robots?
<comment>
No.
You get out of life what your parents put into it.
And your children get what you put into theirs.
By the time you go from poor to rich you will be too old to do things with that money that you wanted to.(unless you become a crypto trillionaire at 18 or something)

I'd say it's rather like poker. Your choices do have some affect on the course of events, but a lot of things are still up to chance. the just world fallacy is still a fallacy, but it's equally absurd to assume your choices mean nothing

you can close the thread now, op

Basically yes. Just with a delay of one life. The situation you're in now, physically, mentally, economically, is the result of the things you have done in your last life. This is called Karma and it's a reversed feedback. Who has power and abuses it will be powerless in his next life. Who abuses sex will be a lonely virgin. Who was rich and greedy will be poor and a wage slave. Bad actions also manifest as sickness, uglyness and being victim of violence and hate.
Imagine how the world could be, if all people would understand this. Everyone would try to be good, just for the own interest. No one would freak out about a seemingly unfair world, where rich and poor, chads and incels exists, if all people would understand that Karma is never unfair.

do you get out of life what your put in
NO
What you get out of life is what you ACCEPT into it. There is always a choice to do something else or to be content with the what you have.

You don't get to choose whether are good at poker or not.

I'm not getting anything but I'm also not doing anything
The main thing that sucks about life, though, is that you start every day in debt and have to pay that off first. For example, even if you take away rent and bills and just become homeless, you will wake up at negative food. So every day you need to find at least +1 food. You're always dying or losing something, either calories or rent or whatever.
You cannot be at 0. That's basically what makes me mad. Because then I could just choose to not participate. I could just walk around, doing nothing.
But I always start out at -1 food even if I owned absolutely nothing.
<comment>
Did you think of buying +5 food the day before for once so you can be ahead?
<comment>
Yeah but that's what I'm saying, you always have to be "ahead" of something. There's always this drain. You can't pause.
<comment>
The pause is when you are ahead. Then you can ride it out until you need another +5.
<comment>
no. its more about momentum and luck than free will.

The quote "chance favors only the prepared mind" can be expanded to life in general. Life will throw you opportunities, but if you aren't ready to catch them you'll never get anywhere. You have to have resources, mental health, fitness, and knowledge to do what you want. The only way to be sure you'll fail is to never try.

I actually quite like the way the question is phrased. You do get out of life what you put into it. Some people are very lucky to have been born and raised in a place where they have more to put in, and some people aren't so lucky. I mean this both materially, and in terms of meaning. You need both, and they interplay in somewhat subtle manners. I grew up poor, and am barely figuring out what I want that is meaningful. It's very difficult to find life meaningful when you suffer from material problems, but it's also very difficult to solve material problems if you are suffering from meaning-based problems. I grew up pretty poor. Barely figuring out the meaning aspects. Hopefully this will get me to the material aspects. Almost made it into school, but ofc inflation is now fucking me and I can barely pay bills. Lost a lot of the hope I had and trying to claw it back so I can continue growing in both regards. 
Also, ignore anyone who places blame. You can place blame and there can be truth to it, but that doesn't stop you from being a free agent responsible only for yourself. The biggest faggots I've ever met in my entire life are all like that. Whiny nihilistic babies who will continue to rot.

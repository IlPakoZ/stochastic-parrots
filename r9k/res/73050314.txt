By using the access granted by yourself (the User) by accepting the Terms and Conditions of Operation, Google Chrome has used its access to your computer's core processes to take over 10,000 pictures of your penis. Each image is stored in a Google database, and is in queue behind approximately 226.8 million other users to be compiled and triangulated by an AI to create a digital penile fingerprint, which is connected to logs of your online interactions and activity. This may be used to identify you by the Google Dissent Management Taskforce (GDMT) in the event of a successful coup organised by Google.

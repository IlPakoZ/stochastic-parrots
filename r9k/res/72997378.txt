<comment>
I get it, the first thing people ask when I get in a VC is if Im a faggot. But your voice is genuinely nice, like some people have really loud and annoying voices, you dont, I could unironically listen to you for hours and not be annoyed. (Not a faggot)

Fyi to everybody in this thread, this guy is literally a masochistic faggot that likes getting attention for his faggot voice. He has made this thread at least 4 times now.

<comment>
I don't think you sound gay necessarily but I do have another critique of your voice which I have recorded in a vocaroo:

You have a rising inflection on the last syllable of your words, which women do. Even if it's subconscious, you are intentionally trying to sound like a woman, hence your faggoty anime girl pic which we are supposed to associate with you. Also you're a phone poster, another womanly trait. You might as well just transition now and submit your bussy to me.
<comment>
you've got that gay/trans voice
if i heard you in a VC i'd immediately expect to see "she/her!" in your discord bio alongside an anime pfp like the one in the op

Stop making these threads. Yes, you sound like a faggot, and you have said as much as well as you want to be a tranny, maybe you are not serious, but you seem to get off on acting like you are a mentally ill faggot. You seem to like attention as much as you pretend to, or do like cocks. 
If you seriously see any of these things as problems and don't just get off on attention, stop coming to here and /adv/ posting your fucking voice, otherwise I don't think you can solve a single issue in your life, furthermore, habits like this, if repeated, shape your soul. Your soul will be shaped such that it will be by default in a condition of being an insincere faggot who cries wolf. You seem like a confused person, and if I am any bit right, and there isn't something a am missing here, I would seriously suggest you snap out of this shit and quit posting these threads, try to have some sincerity in your life, because I know from experience that if you don't, and you act like a faggot like this, you will be lost, at least it's what happened to me and I see no other possible outcome.
<comment>
well i am a bottom
<comment>
Yeah. You definitely sound like a queer.
<comment>
im just a guy tho
<comment>
You sound just a bit like a homo, yes, but you can fix that by using "like" less! (ideally, at least less than once in 20 words)

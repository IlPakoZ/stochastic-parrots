be me
see cool knife used in unboxing video
find it online but it's like $100
nice knife, but I don't need it $100
start going down the rabbit hole
realize that Benchmade knives(which are like $250+) are just the beginning
folding knives selling for $1k plus
military style tactical knives for $500+
are people really buying these?
I have a few watches that cost $500 and a couple that were over $1k so I kind of understand. To be real though you'll probably just lose the knife or put it in a drawer and forget you have it.

anon there are people who spend that much on super-powerful flashlights
for almost any item there is a community of autists who will spend piles of mone to have the Very Best(tm)

i would love to get some cool knifes and other knick knacks

Nice things are nice. But if you're going to buy a knife you should keep in mind that 1) using it for self-defense is full retard and 2) you're better off spending a few hundred dollars on something made of solid high-carbon steel from a reputable company than gimicky things. You don't need something super fancy, but having a solid folding knife like the Recon 1 or a good fixed blade like the GI Tanto. Leathermen are also good EDC.
But yes; knives are one of the most useful tools you can own

Just buy the good knives from some of the Chinese manufacturers, $30 to $80 with tons of variety in steel and design. The knife autists are no different than the pokemon card ones, turning consoomption into an expensive hobby and collecting shit they don't even use.

Just buy a mora
<comment>
Why using it for self defense would be stupid? Isnt that what they're made for?
<comment>
Check out mora knives, they're cheap, utilitarian, and good quality for knives you will actually use in the woods
<comment>
Only autists buy knives on that price range.
Here's how it goes:
Buy knife
Post pictures on 4chan/reddit/whatever shithole you want
Store it
Look at it from time to time
Never use it
???
That's it. For light tasks literally any folding knife that isn't absolute shit ($10-20 will get you there) will get the job done, and if you have to do something more intensive a cheap fixed knife like a Mora is miles better than the most expensive folding knife.

instead of buying nice expensive knives I just keep several cheap chink-shit ones around. You can have a knife, a backup knife, and one to use while you get around to sharpening one of the others, and it's still less money than the nice knives. And if you abuse them and break one, well, who cares, you're only out a few bucks and you already have a replacement while you're waiting for another one to get shipped to you.

Yeah. My most expensive knife was like $300 but that's my limit. If I was making bank I would gladly sink $2500+ for a custom Terry Guinn or Paletheus BC. Them shits are beautiful.
Buying watches
That I don't understand. I have a computer and a phone for that, and there are clocks in my cars, on the walls, the TV, microwave, oven, etc.
<comment>
Same here, it really depends on your budget but I'd say never go above something you don't feel comfortable abusing and possibly breaking.
My most used knives are a stainless steel Opinel n8, Victorinox Classic, Svord Peasant, Ganzo 729 and Morakniv Basic.
Most expensive knife is a Buck Slim I got because it was on sale for $20 and I have yet to use it.

That I don't understand
While not a necessity it's a commodity, I like to be able to look at the time without pulling my phone out.
This is even more convenient when /out/ doing fishing or other stuff that can get your hands dirty.
I'm a cheap ass about watches too and I just own a Casio 1200 and a Seiko 5 I got for $50 before they achieved meme status and got discontinued.

use it to stab normies

knives are for prying out the eyes of shitbulls, and sticking up shitbull assholes

the only thing between a sharp blade and your hand is a cheap lock

don't cut toward yourself. this is rule #1, whether you have a fancy, ordinary, or cheap-ass knife in your hand.
<comment>
stay out of autistic fetishism. it's very cringe and ick.
you really only need one small knife and a boxcutter.
i've been using a 1.25" CRKT my brother gave me a couple decades ago. still works great.

imagine being on a date with a guy whos only """"hobby"""" is buying a thing no one needs more than one of lmao
<comment>
don't go down that path. you will become addicted to buying increasingly expensive versions of the same thing for the same or lesser high. i knew a chud who got that way with camera shit, eventually getting into the thousands for each item, while not even owning a pillow. he had absolutely no photo composition skills and couldn't take a photo more flattering than an old man's laptop webcam selfie

when i get bullied i stab stuff and it feels cathartic :3

All RELIGIONS Are Evil.
Generation Alpha is screwed, if they don't become conservatives. To clarify It, to be a conservative, you don't need religion.

I thought that whole incident was some kinda misunderstanding? Dalai Lama is basically trying to gross out the child and get a funny reaction. The phrase is supposedly Che La Sa in tibetan, which is a common tibetan phrase.

What is a conservative anyways?
I recently watched a coservative commentator react to trans tiktoks on youtube and he just kept talking about how "WE NEED TO LET GAY BOTTOMS BE GAY BOTTOMS we need to stop this dangerous trans trend making all the gays cut off their dicks!!!" and i was like... what??? This is the conservative position on lgbt now? What the fuck is a conservative?
Christ is King, stop poisoning the well you degenerate pagan/atheist shills.
Not OP, but conservatism is defined by the preservation of tradition, as tradition, no matter how flawed, is better than the risk of progress too fast or unchecked. 
Progressivism is the opposite of conservatism.
So conservatism doesnt really have any policies its just "wait you're going to fast keep doing it but slightly slower."?
Wow... what a joke.
Religions??? Noooo.. please, no.

i think i might have perfect pitch but i can't really tell, i can just do scales with my voice and know i'm doing them without needing to listen to anything else
When not go into music and create some amazing songs that are perfect?
I would love to hear them
The only kind of music I'd be at all interested in producing would be that which healed and soothed other people, really I'd just prefer to be an EMT, but of course they get paid a trash salary, maa ii ya
Then do this and see how many you can make that touch a persons life, only "YOU" have this gift to see and make advanced music. You could create magic music that goes deeper and saves everyone

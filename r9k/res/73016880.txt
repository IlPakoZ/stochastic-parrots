Why don't people make posts worshipping Iris anymore?

She wised up and stopped posting or at least doesn't make it obvious who she is anymore.

did Jesus stay with us forever? No. He gave us the oportunity to make place in our hearts for him in order to be liberated and saved. He is within us too, just not materially. 
Same with Iris, anon. May you be pure as she taught us.

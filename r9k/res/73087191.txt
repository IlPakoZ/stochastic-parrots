Daily reminder that there is a high chance that your grandmother was a slut in her youth
Uhm, based? I hope so. Even better if she took BBC.
Nope, she got raped when she was 11, was scarred from sex, and didn't have sex with anyone until my grandpa. And he says she barely ever puts out.
some dead bitches used to be hoes, how does this affect me
My grandma was born in the early twenties when women observed modesty, sorry that your mothers and grandmothers were fucked by negroes I guess
I imagine she was since she only married in 40's and was basically homeless before that, so she probably got passed around to survive.
he doesnt know they called it the roaring twenties for a reason
My grandpa divorced my grandma because she kept cheating on him.
There's more than a high chance as today's grandmas are boomers who accelerated degeneracy with their 1960s summer of love shit.
I want to go back, that time looked so nice and fun and colorful

i cant wait to be single, im slipping away in the middle of the night when the time is right
imagine one of our fights like pic related but its 3 am and shes got a knife and blood from self harming while she screams at me after breaking into my room. cant throw her off or fight back since she bruises easily and i didnt want to be arrested.

WITH A KNIFE????
leave, got to court to issue a restraining order, stay away from women for a while since that relationship was probably traumatizing, get therapy

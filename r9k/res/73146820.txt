Good evening, anon. Has anything surprising happened to you lately, or are things just as usual?
<comment>
Good evening anon. One thing that was surprising that happened a week ago was I chatted with the the office lady. Other than that, nothing too out of the ordinary.
<comment>
Ooh, what did you talk about? Why did she contact you?
<comment>

has anything surprising happened to you mio poster
<comment>
I mean, I guess you could call it surprising? I dunno how I feel about talking about it, but let's just say it's some Discord stuff. I must not be a very interesting person if the most surprising thing happening to me is some Discord stuff, am I?

but now im in suspense, i gotta know
<comment>
what did you talk about?
We talked about music, my college plan, dreams, and some small talk.
Why did she contact you?
I wished her happy birthday like a month before but she was busy so she didn't see it till then.
It went well I'd say. It was an enjoyable conversation.
<comment>
Well... it concerns someone who's been posting on this board, and the posts are probably too easy to find, so... I don't know if I wanna go into too much detail here for the sake of privacy. If you wanna talk somewhere else, then sure.

It feels somewhat awkward atleast for me. I enjoy talking with her but it doesn't have the same feeling as before.
<comment>
i think i understand, i wonder if she thinks the same
what do you think is awkward about it? could it ever be fixed?
<comment>
What is awkward is that it is a friendship that is unable to progress anywhere. I don't know if would be possible to be fixed. She is busy so my opportunities to potentially interact with her is extremely limited.

day 4603 of missing someone

How special was this person to you?
<comment>
yeah every office woman ive ever met is always busy and stressed as hell my guy
they almost never have little to no friends and have a hard time with relationships outside of their coworkers or clients or whatever
shit sucks, i wonder if the office lady is a lonely person

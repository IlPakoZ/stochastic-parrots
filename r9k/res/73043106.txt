Any other robots here teachers? 
long paid holidays
well paid for basically glorified babysitting
gov work so impossible to get fired
even if you're an autistic retard
get worshipped by cute girls if you're a young dude and not hideous
I think I finally found something I can do with the rest of my life
<comment>
please do not tell me you are teaching in any classroom where the youngest student is below the age of 16
<comment>
way younger than that, anon.
<comment>
yes and these kids got me fucked up.
<comment>
Elaborate, friendo
<comment>
thread needs more stick-chan
<comment>
teachers are always hot
<comment>
If you didn't have an ugly as fuck female health class teacher in her 50's you missed out on the high school experience desu
<comment>
well paid
as a teacher
Yeah you definitely don't live in America.
<comment>
ok yes good point, thats an exception..

Mine never shut the fuck up about her daughters hymen and how her daughter broke it on a swingset and how her pediatrician asked questions and thought she and her husband raped her and they had to explain it to the pediatrician
mfw it was a cover story and they actually just raped her
Jk. Unless
<comment>
eurotrash. it's good enough, especially if you're a debauched hebephilic midwit competent enough to get a uni degree but not competent enough to get a job with it.
<comment>
I was almost a teacher but then I realized lots of the students, the girls included, were taller than me so I dropped out. No one is going to respect a 170cm tall teacher ;_;
<comment>
tfw your parents buy you a new swingset as an apology for letting you get raped by uncle pete
<comment>
No but I'm considering it. I finished a philosophy degree lately so maybe I can try to be a lecturer at a community college or something. It's that or software. I think I'll do software at first because I'd like to try travelling in an RV while doing remote work (and it would help to build savings too), but maybe afterwards I'll give teaching a shot. 
My favorite philosopher is Heidegger, who had an affair with a 17-year-old student when he was 35.
<comment>
170cm
on the bright side a few inches shorter and you could look up their skirts from standing height
<comment>
I could never be a teacher. too many are too cute looking to concentrate properly.
would i get shadowbanned for saying this
<comment>
i was worried i'd get sussed out but irlolis are completely oblivious to the occasional stare.
shadowbanned

Anon.....people notice when another person is looking at them, they always do. I learned the hard way in high school when I stared at girls all the time, and noticed them looking at me with faces of digust and horror. At least they never said anything to me directly though, so deep down, they probably liked the attention, right?
Also, kill yourself degenerate
<comment>
I give two Civil Engineering classes in my local college and it's been a nice experience so far. I even landed a cute architect gf that's also a teacher there
<comment>
I reported you to the federal authorities for suspected child abuse and they will be soon be contacting your ISP and potential VPN provider with a very rough subpoena soon.
<comment>
they probably liked the attention, right?
imma let you in on a crazy secret that it took me a few years to work out anon. 
most girls aged 12-16 are perpetually horny from puberty and love getting attention from young men.
Also, kill yourself degenerate
not until I find out if elder scrolls vi is shit or not.
<comment>
I'm gonna make waco look like a fuckin drug bust
<comment>
c'mon anon, you know I'm just playing, fellow uhohbro.
<comment>
Thanks Marisafag
<comment>
Muh fuckin' nigga. Keep on keeping on.

I wonder if my taste in cute schoolgirls anime as a teenage weeaboo turned me into a degenerate or if I was always going to end up this way.

I taught in Japan for 5 years. It made me real fucking uncomfortable and paranoid I'd be arrested. I was 22 in a not so well off school with kids who had less inhibition shall we say. I had lots of them looking at me, some flirted, 1 straight up asked me to date her and 2 others asked me to date once they'd graduated. I was expecting a knock on the door any moment, shit was terrifying.
<comment>
It's natural to like cute, fresh, energetic girls, regardless of who you are. 
At least a majority of the male population (as well as a significant percentage of the female one, honestly) would pretend that there aren't a lot of fucking hot lolis but melt at the sight of a teenage goddess.
<comment>
Damn, it must've been awful having a bunch of teenage girls lusting after you. My heart goes out to you, anon.
<comment>
I was expecting a knock on the door any moment
Please tell me it's because you fucked them and not just because you were a paranoid sperg
<comment>
he still couldn't smash because he's their teacher so idk why you think that matters.
<comment>
Does anyone even really give a shit about the age discrepancy over in Japan, as opposed to the racial or caste difference of a white English teacher doing something to a nip maiden? 
I think the idea that every guy who acknowledges that a young girl can be attractive is a vicious, deadly grooming rapist is a uniquely American idea invented by the intelligence agencies so they can kidnap children and sell them to billionaires while cherry-picking the fattest losers to prosecute and hang on a cross as public amusement.
<comment>
teenage goddess
every teacher has their favorite student...
<comment>
Right? 
It's normal, natural, and a problem for the orderly machinations of a global capitalist system, so you must be punished for so much as glancing at the absolute zone of a fertile beauty, as defined by the sagacious loliwizard Konata Izumi.
<comment>
Thanks anon, makes me feel a little better about obsessing over a teenage girl who's supposed to be one of my students.
<comment>
When they are 13 to 16 yes it is because at the end of the day Japan has sham courts. They just have to suspect you touched a student and you'll be locked up guaranteed because you're foreign and thus evil. Japan is a paradise compared to the west but it's a lot more fucked up then people realise. During my time there I had 2 suicides and one attempted from my students, the music teacher (japanese guy) got caught pressuring student into sex and fucking them so he got locked up and I had a bunch of the kids always flirting or trying to touch.
I fucked 2 of them on the regular but they weren't students at that point and were 18. One of them I bumped into working at a bar and the other one was a returning student who came to the night school I worked for. Those two I could get away with but anything else? Fuck that I'm not going to a Japanese prison. The mom's though. I don't know how many of those I had.
<comment>
Anon, you'll always be one of the real assed motherfuckers on this board to me. You're just being honest, which itself is an act of rebellion at this point. Keep on keepin' on.
<comment>
It's just nice to vent how I feel. I think middle school girls are cute as fuck and I love them. I hope you have the same happiness I've found.
<comment>
Amazing taste, anon, but I mostly just get drunk and high all day and shitpost while jerking off to loli hentai at night to sleep. Hopefully, this will magically lead to some form of happiness rather than consolation.
<comment>
I used to work in a youth ministry and the girl thing is true, honestly it was very dangerous. They lack any sense of self control, consider you a prize because you're a grown adult and they have no reference point other than their fathers, they assume you would feel better than boys their age, and they typically romanticize you.
I swear to the god I don't believe in, this is for you FBI agent, I DID NOTHING. But I definitely could have if I was a moron, which I am not.
<comment>
Don't worry. I spend most of summer break doing the same thing.
I'm not retarded enough to try anything with them, I like my freedom too much. Sometimes I just like to wonder how I got so lucky I can spend all this time with such perfect little angels and get paid for it.
<comment>
Thabk you. That is exactly what it was like in Japan. They see you as a kind of prize and they think that if they can bag you it means they are mature and grown up. I've had one of those 14 year old grab me and hug me and say she loved me. I'm noping out of any situation like that. They are cute as fuck but not worth 10 to 20 in a Japanese prison.
<comment>
your behavior is why society tries to keep men away from caregiver roles
Yeah they're 100% hunting you. Female attraction looks at the full package. What you look like, your status, what you can give them, how you can make them feel, etc. So when teenage girls see a 20-something year old man they're looking at everything that 20-something year old man could make them. They probably assume that you're constantly on crazy adventures, at parties, or whatever. Plus then they can be the girl that pulled it off. Everyone would know that she's the one that's special enough for adults.
Another situation is if you're able to speak with them about personal issues. Very few adults give adolescents any time to express their feelings and then answer those feelings with respect. Just a few honest conversations where you treat them like an actual human with real thoughts and they view you as a savior. That was a common issue for me, especially because being available as support was part of the job description.
I had some really difficult situations because of it. Girls in churches are expected to be married with children by 20. To them it's normal to try and hook a reliable man early.

Teaching in 2023 is one of the worst jobs imaginable. It pays like ass, there are no more snow days off or breaks off and everything is on zoom or microsoft teams now and the students are subhuman. 
impossible to get fired
Try doing crack on the job and see how long they want to keep you around. Also say you like Hitler and watch as in seconds your job becomes nonexistent. 
glorified baby sitting
No, being a teacher is being an unwilling zookeeper and the monkeys and the ostriches are constantly at war with each other. 
gets worshipped by cute girls
OP is a pedophile and shoot himself.
<comment>
maybe if you live in afghanistan, the society I live in pays me to spend 7 hours a day surrounded by cunny.
<comment>
It's really interesting thinking back to how my (and presumably all of our) female peers as teenagers did this.
<comment>
It pays like ass,
American moment
there are no more snow days off or breaks off 
Literally had two snow days last march
and everything is on zoom or microsoft teams now and the students are subhuman
Literally haven't used zoom or teams since they decided COVID was over.
Try doing crack on the job and see how long they want to keep you around. Also say you like Hitler and watch as in seconds your job becomes nonexistent.
fortunately I'm not a crackhead or a nazi. now remind me how many government employees lost their jobs this year because of downsizing or corporate consolidation
No, being a teacher is being an unwilling zookeeper and the monkeys and the ostriches are constantly at war with each other.
literally just don't work in the ghetto.
OP is a pedophile and shoot himself.
Why yes, I am a hebephile.
<comment>
you also have fuck all free time as they want you to plan classes at home
<comment>
depends on the school desu, your mileage may vary with planning.
idk why i'm being so defensive about my job
<comment>
your behavior is why society tries to keep men away from caregiver roles
Shut the fuck up, faggot. I hope someone rapes your future daughter and she begs you to let him marry you, fucking proxycuck.
<comment>
what cunt, OP? my plan, if all else fails, is to go teach (for non-perverse reasons) english since that is the only thing i am good at, in a european country that isn't the UK obviously (unless they need english teachers in ireland for people who only speak irish? I don't think that's a thing though)
I've unironically considered going to japan but japanese is fucking hard and I would have to consider getting a jap wife if I would be moving there to teach. I'm not that handsome and am a dark featured germoid so I would look like just another gook in the crowd and be a ricecel by association
also, a little unrelated - i dunno what it is but even though i had a shit experience in school, it is like there is this longing to still be there. like a longing for closure. i want to have a good school experience. is that bad? it's not like i wouldn't be a good teacher or wouldn't care about the kids. i'm a pretty nurturing person. it's just that, what can you do if you are trapped in an ugly, dirty building with kids that don't want to learn and actively hinder any that do with their every action, and a school that has no money? it's pretty depressing and it's going to be like that regardless of me being there or not. that was my experience in school. surrounded by niggers, literally failing classes that I attended all year and did work for because teachers could not take attendance properly in the chaos.
<comment>
You're so fucking dumb that you couldn't pass a class full of disruptive, braindead negros?
I find it hard to believe you could handle being in an actual society that requires some basic level of mental competence. I have no doubt your home country was too busy rolling its eyes at you to take your pitiful goblin ass seriously.
Fuck off and die, faggot.
<comment>
You get paid like shit and the students don't respect you, though. Also,
sexual tension
If you want to get fucking fired, sure. This also doesn't even remotely apply for something like middle school/elementary. That being said, subbing hasn't been as awful as I've expected it to be. I'm kinda locked into being a teacher due to a combo of cheating through college and useless degree (math). So I hope it's not as awful as people are saying.
Glorified babysitting isn't exactly the job description either, as you're supposed to teach the students and make sure they are learning. You don't get tested annually as a babysitter.
<comment>
OP - i'm a bong, and there's very few irish people who don't speak english.
I went into this job for non-perverse reasons also, mostly because I was never gonna get a job related to my degree and because I wanted the extra holidays. Being surrounded by forbidden cuties is just a bonus.
Just make sure you research whatever school you want to work at. Get a teaching qualification and some experience working with children, make sure it's what you want. When you experience education from the other end, you'll see very quickly that what seemed important at 16 was actually meaningless, so if you want closure on your own school experience, you might find it. Just don't expect the kids to understand the value of education or any bullshit like that.
Kill yourself &lt;3
<comment>
you get paid like shit
Yeah you won't be making the same as an engineer or a doctor, sorry to break it to you. It's kind of the tradeoff of a job that requires relatively few actual skills and which gives you months of paid leave every year.
students don't respect you
Actual warning - if you can't get their respect then leave. Get another career. Don't be the poor loser getting punked by his students on a regular basis. Become a rent boy or something less degrading.
if you want to get fucking fired
If you teach highschool, are young, and a dude I guarantee you will be getting eyefucked regularly, teenage girls are the horniest brats on the planet. Remember it's not your fault and ignore it (or get high off it if you're like me)
you're supposed to teach the students and make sure they are learning
After 2 or 3 years that shit comes naturally. Everything else? Babysitting.
<comment>
I'm a bong
kill yourself &lt;3
Not before you, you fucking pajeet-rimming joke of a white person. You're nothing but a pitiful race traitor, seated in the most humiliated bastion of whiteness present. Your various colonies are fucking you, and all you do is get arrested when you open your hideous, gap-toothed mouth at the various pajeetas infesting your land. 
The british, without contest, are the most disgusting, pathetic and worthless group of slaves (except for niggers, who don't really count as people)
Are you even allowed to post here? I'm pretty sure King Charles CunnyCracker doesn't like competition.
<comment>
Are you a teacher? I've been subbing for awhile now, and have gotten very little respect from students, albeit I've heard that comes with the territory. Some classes have been better than others, though.
<comment>
I'm OP, and yeah that would explain a lot. If you're a sub you're not gonna get much respect since you're just some literally who that walked in the front door. When you have your own classes they will warm to you pretty quickly, teenagers are surprisingly deferential to adults they see regularly.
So much hate and anger anon. I'll spend some time on my bonus holiday from King Chad's coronation thinking of you.
<comment>
what do you want me to elaborate anon
same i would get my shit rocked as someone LPA tiered
<comment>
At least you have good taste, you fucking international cuckold. Don't get arrested posting drawings of girls who aren't 30 yet though, fuckmuffin. Daddy Charles can smash any 3 year old up the ass all he wants, but you need to behave.
<comment>
yes and these kids got me fucked up.
fucked up... how? we're all friends here.
<comment>
Fuck the police, I will post cunny until the day I die. God save the cunnychad king.
<comment>
I'm pretty sure it's AAVE, agent
<comment>
I love you despite your brain being connected to Big Ben and requiring royal permission to brush your teeth, bongboy. Cunnybros are the best bros across the world, regardless of race, creed or nationality. Keep Calm, Carry on, and fuck the police. I love you just for existing. Great taste.

Cunnychad supremacy

god I love being a teacher

If only being a teacher didnt have such shit pay in america I'd do it too
<comment>
No one is going to respect a 170cm tall teacher ;_;
Had a professor that was ex-military. Guy was shorter than that and didn't give any fuck. People don't respect you because you act like a fag.

America continues to cuck hebechads unjustly.
Teaching after sports class is always the best. Ever been in a room full of sweaty teen girls?
<comment>
I mean yes I am a woman so I have been in a room full of sweaty teen girls. Couldnt stare too much by fear of being bullied for acting like a sus lesbo tho.

Why are you pedophile?

Very jelly, bongistani-sensei. Great pic.

very based
I got stories and cute lolis plenty.
<comment>
Why do you celebrate a man shoving his cock up another man's asshole and shooting him full of AIDS, but decry the natural inclination that all (normal) males have towards young, fertile females? Contrary to what they told you, being a faggot is not normal, and definitely not something worthy of celebration or praise.

little girls are my lifeblood!

Love you, anons. Fuck normies and their insincere bullshit.

You must be really hopeful if you think it's not going to be trash.

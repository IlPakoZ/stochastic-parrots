How the actual fuck is this an original sentence? 
How has nobody said this within the entire history of the board? I don't get /r9k/ sometimes.

Lucky you. I saw like 50 of them. Worst was when they were holding hands with white women.

Very troubling.
Thank you. I'm still a bit shaken up.

I am sorry to hear that OP. That can be a very upsetting and traumatic thing to see. Just be lucky you made it out of there with your life. Many are not so lucky.

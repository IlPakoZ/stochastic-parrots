I'm sexually attracted to pubescent girls. What do I do?
<comment>
Exclusively? Or can you still get hard to adult women?
<comment>
Become a eunuch and get castrated (only cutting off testicles)
For to get in the Kingdoom of Heaven you have to be a Eunuch
<comment>
Not exclusively, but sometimes after I jack off enough, adult women don't do it for me anymore. That's not to imply that I don't enjoy young girls at other times, however.
<comment>
Then you have no problem. Every healthy man enjoys a bit of cunny from time to time.
<comment>
Ok, but like...I should still try to stop, right?
<comment>
Don't. I lost 5 years of my life on probation and 30k for lawyers. Had to go to therapy. Got it all vacated but for a few years my life was pretty annoying for one night of bunny cunny. 
My advice. Date short chick's instead.

Yeah I'm gonna need the story on this one
<comment>
I don't have that problem but I'm still attracted to teens (which are legal in other states but not in mine)
<comment>
at least jerk off less

kek holy shit man

Assuming I ever end up with a wife/gf, should I ever tell her about this? Part of me wants to be honest, but part of me thinks it will just bring trouble.

Plead the 5th and 6th then find the biggest kite in town to represent you.
Attorney said if I had not plead the 5th and 6th immediately I would have been gone forever.
I did what he told me to and plead to a lesser charge with no registration and probation.
I DID have to go to jail for 6 months, but it was actually very chill and made a DND group to pass time.
GF sent me tons of books and commissary money.
As to what really happened? Dindu nuffin

never do this
<comment>
GF was the one with bunny snatch you crushed? How old was the girl you were accused of being with?
<comment>
Isn't it important to be open and honest in a relationship?
<comment>
There's honesty and then there's oversharing.
<comment>
Yeah, part of me thinks it would just make not ever trust me around kids or anything (Even though I would never do that). How do I cope knowing that i have this secret though?
<comment>
Did you mean prepubescent?
Just dont get caught man. How old was she?
<comment>
Did you mean prepubescent?
No, that would pedo. I like girls who are just starting puberty

Ephebophilia is still illegal. Expect glowies.

I feel like I have a monkey paw superpower.
Some nights, it feels like every thread I touch dies.
Yeah, that's happened a lot of times to me. It's sad because there couldve been a lot of cool discussion on the thread, but it had to die for some shitty bait thread
Stop making crap replies to threads that you want to be alive, it seems.
If only it worked like that, but effortposting often goes unnoticed while shitposts go on forever.
Hypocrite, for you replied to my post and kept it alive, therefore proving my point.
It's the exception that confirms the rule or some shit, I don't care.
If you posted something that made too much sense and no one in the thread could contest it or shout buzzwords without seeming mad then yeah that happens a lot here
Thank you for your concession.
You won an argument bro, I bet you feel amazing right now.
That's a good point, effortposting can actually end a thread.
Yes, but not because I won. In this moment, I am ecstatic because I am bumping a non-bait thread.
Fair. Although it's not a very good non-bait thread imo.

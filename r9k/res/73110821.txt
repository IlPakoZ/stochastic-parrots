Do you keep a dream journal? :0
No my dreams are boring.
Like yesterday I dreamt to had to walk home but I had lost one of my shoes hardly worth recording
I forget my dreams as soon as I wake up
My dreams are just representations of my life. I lay in bed awake fearing what will come when I finally sleep. I have no escape. Not even sleep. I need to die.
Weird. I always get realistic nightmares or really surreal dreams
Still have it, but don't write anything. In my prime I could spend one and a half hour wtiting in it. First and only lucid dream report spanned several a4 pages.
Don't have time or energy anymore.
I write my dreams down on my phone as soon as I wake up so I don't forget them. Today I had a dream where I found an injured puppy and took it into my care only for my mother to throw him back into the wilderness where I later found his corpse mangled and eaten.

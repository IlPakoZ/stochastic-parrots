Any slightly odd or peculiar stories from your family?
Be me, mutt
Little contact with black side of family
Lived mostly on a single very small town on the countryside up until the last generation
Strangely wealthy
Somehow owned pretty much the whole town
Slowly sold it or gave it away as a favour to new settlers
Everyone in the town knows family by name
Grandmother, family's matriarch, somehow has a seemingly endless stash of gold and jewelry
Married to a small skinny white guy
Their children all mixed with whites
No matter how far into the branches of the family tree you go and how mixed they are, all her kin have some defining features
Round, large orbitals, a distinct prominence at the middle of their brow and a slightly lower right eye 
As they age, their eyelids droop down almost to the point of covering their eyes, the sockets hollow and become ghoulish, and sometimes the odd lower eye becomes strabic
Grandma hands out small gold rings, bracelets and colars to family members who have achieved something, usually college and the like
You eventually get taken into her room to have some sort of "talk" about the gold.
It was my older brother's turn last time
Soon it will be my turn

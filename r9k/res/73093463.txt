I have a learning difficulty due to fetal alcohol syndrome. Can I be still succeed in life?
if your measure of success is a middle class lifestyle, yes.

You'll be fine. If I can start a business, fix complicated mechanical devices and build and maintain computers (both software and hardware) then you'll find a way as well.
Keep at it and don't give up. you only loose when you give up and stop trying. You can do it.

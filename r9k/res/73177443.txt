Why are soooooooo many humans like aliens!?!?!?!? lmfaoooooo!!!!
Every time I listen to how humans sound when they talk I'm just like.. "That sounds more like a fancy alien than it does a human wtf!!!"

You have autism
I think autism is cute, it sounds very cute
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan with Isabella Rossellini lips

Did a slo-mo Matrix descent out of the butt-end of the banana vessel
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw
I started laughing and clapping like a baby after I read that!!!
ITT: Autistic human alien babies

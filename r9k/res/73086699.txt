should I fall for the cooding memes or trades memes? 
I literally have to apply today or next week and I still have no idea
at worst I do this for a year and continue on with my studies after
become an auto mechanic specializing in self-driving electric cars
I have no interest though, no such thing specializing in electronic cars though
"Technical college" is usually the term
Just know, it doesn't get any better.
I wish I had killed myself in high school.
I recommend you do the same.
Times up, time to leave, I have no time for preparation, yet I had the whole last week, I dont have enough time, theres never enough time, time moves too fast; I always procrastinate, I am never prepared, I was gonna do a bunch of stuff yesterday but I was totally mind fucked from not sleeping and being at this jobplace all day
missed that opportunity
anyway time to leave
Fuck It's exactly like that.
I can always leave.
I just need to leave.
I just CAN'T just do it.
Whatever leave might mean.
Death?
Change?
Whatever.
Settling is the sign of a dying man.

Ok, that sounds really like Indonesian to me but you said no...that leave East Timor? Is that a country or is it a part of Indonesia? I can't remember. Sorry if that offends you, anon.

<comment>
Middle East. Somewhere in that region. You're not speaking Arabic or Hindu. Urdu, North African region.
<comment>
i dont know the name of the language but sounds a lot like what indonesian ppl speak
<comment>
Ok, that has to be one of the billion languages in India if it isn't Indonesian or Malay. So India is my guess. I dunno why this is bothering me so much that I can't get it, god dammit!
<comment>
it really sounds like javanese but i'd say it could be tamil
<comment>
oh shit.. it's Thai
<comment>
could be Urdu. it's definitely not a semitic language. but i think it's not an indoeuropean language either. I'd go with Austronesian language. i'm now obssessed with this thread since im kind of a language nerd
<comment>
You know, you could be right. I seem to remember the songs from some Thai martial arts films I used to love as a kid, and they sounded very similar.
<comment>
WELL, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THE ANSWER ANON??
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
Absolute bullshit.

<comment>
I don't know why I cared so much for an answer, but I'm now so hideously disappointed that you tricked us all. I hate you anon. Great thread 10/10

Not so, far not so close. It's romance
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
https://voca.ro/1Lc8r9MALTAa

<comment>
FUCK YES!! I'm the king of r9k languages
<comment>
are there anon who speak basque here?
<comment>
It would be very weird, from my time living at at the Basque country it's only used in the rural areas
Of all the official regional languages it's the second less spoken just before Aranese (Occitan of the Val d'Aran)
<comment>
but i think they know basque since it's taught at school. i'm not sure if it's every school but i'm almost sure public schools do teach euskera batua.
but yeah i dont think it is actually spoken much. it's actually a koinee or unified "artificial" language like modern hebrew
<comment>
Yeah, at much expect someone remembering the basics from school
<comment>
Sounds like tagalog

Spoooooky, I hear Poland is very haunted by extremely frugal ghosts
<comment>
There are many polish migrants in my country i hate them all
<comment>
You know, I don't mind the Polish ones. Much better than Indians/Pakis.
<comment>
Its Rota, this song is piercing my heart everytime I listen to it. Now that I think about it its both based and disturbing that they teach it to us in 4th grade. 
Have something more upbeat:
https://voca.ro/126Fissce3Tt
Welp :(
<comment>
They're better than those thats true, but they all have this weirdly yellow tint to them. I also despise that language. Still though, atleast they arent running around raping people n shit
<comment>
If you live in your own country youre fine by me lad
<comment>
french
north american english
biblical hebrew
polish yiddish
<comment>
Doesn't that song (Rota) basically contain a bit that says "Fuck Germany"? That's pretty based if you ask me.
You know, I sorta respect the Polish, in that they come here and do more salt of the earth types of jobs, not just tech/finance/whatever.

LMFAO and Im not even Jewish 
says "Fuck Germany"
One of the verses is:
We won't let German spit in our face
Nor Germanize our children
Armed up will arise our force
Holy Ghost will be leading
We'll go when the golden horn will sound
I like when you guys dance 
Dude

Nope, its part of the history and a piece written by one of the most important polish poets. We wouldnt dare to change it and if anyone even suggested that, I would throw hands

https://voca.ro/1fHLEQzenHPZ
<comment>
Use your midriff muscles more and less throat while singing, make sure you hear the vibration/slight pressure in your head (my choir teacher said that if we are dizzy it means we are doing it right kek) also make sure your mouth forms more or an O shape than = shape when singing. 
Damn I miss singing but I started smoking so I will never again hit the notes I could before. God im an idiot
<comment>
Some Scandinavian?
<comment>
it's greek
thanks anon, I always sing from my throat and many people have told me that. to be fair i used to sing in punk bands so i guess i'm used too. good luck quitting smoking, I did and its really worth it and you gain back all your lung capacity so there's no harm done
<comment>
let's gather
<comment>
can you tell a story using that language?

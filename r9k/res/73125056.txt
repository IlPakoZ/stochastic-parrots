Thoughts on the Latino in the middle?
Gorgeous smile, handsome pretty face. Killer bod. I like him in a way that makes me feel funny.
He has a feminine smile and birthing hips, I prefer left and right.
be completely honest, would you?
is it racism?
I mean I've found some hispanic guys attractive, not sure.
One hundred percent, unfortunately I'm jaded due to the "significant portion of stunning men being gay meme" not actually being a meme.
Have you posted photos of attractive boys on boats and at the beach and asked for their ratings before OP? I feel like I remember you.
yes. i prefer spamming the latino nowadays though, good memory
I remember I liked him a lot last time. He was definitely my 1 or 2. Do you get these off a personal ig or have a source?
1 > 5 > 6 > 3 >2 >4
i prefer pale skin, but i also like the faces of 5 and 6.

amazing how women can judge the personalities (which is what they care about the most!) of men over photographies so swiftly, to determine whom they are attracted to. they are all truly master psychologists
You've got me all wrong, I'm just trying to cum to pictures anon. What is this personality you speak of?
How does one prefer the fat #6 to 3?
wont say here but it should be pretty easy to find. hes always a good fap
3 looks feminine to me. 6 is pretty attractive, but I really do just like pale skin. plus, 1's face looks attractive as well.
brutally mogged by right and left guys
The Latino is the cutest imo, the others look generic and boring
the latino gets mogged by nobody because he is perfect
good taste latinanon
bump for latinos
final latino bump
Are you gay, friend? Or just woman
fare thee well latino man
your looks have been served
no do not let him die

i really really do love him so much but i can't even show it over the internet
i'd do anything for him
i'm such a stupid creepy obsessed freak moaning his name into my pillows and thinking about him all day
i can't stop fantasizing about the life we could have together
our cute home, me cooking for him, going out together, falling asleep in his arms, and being in pure bliss
if i only knew what i needed to do to make it happen
i'll finally be able to visit soon (i was never vaxxed) but i don't even know if he wants to see me

if you're both really in love it can't be that hard to work hard at some shit job for like. a couple of months to save up the funds to move in with him. go do it, fag. unless he's a serial killer. you never know i guess

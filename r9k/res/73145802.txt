Even as an adult, are you still afraid to express your feelings for someone? Don't you think it'd feel better to be courageous, even if you get rejected?
There's unfortunately a disconnect with what I want to do in my brain and what I want to do in my soul.
I was courageous and I got rejected. Then I was courageous again and it was mutual, bitch is better looking than last (at least to me).
Wagmi anones, just persist
If I expressed my feelings I would be assaulted or imprisoned. No one would want to hear what I have to say about them
even if you get rejected?
Do you know how women reject men nowadays? There's no reason to willingly accept such humiliation.
Don't you think it'd feel better to be courageous, even if you get rejected?
no because it felt so bad getting rejected every time i tried.
I don't like having feelings and I find it hard to locate them most of the time.
if your life is fucking shit then getting in touch with your feelings is just going to suck ass.
Mf I'm scared to tell anyone anything other then that I'm happy how tf am i suppose to say I love you to someone
Can't things progress more naturally though? You don't need to do a japanese back-of-the-school style confession. Although admittedly asking a woman out is fairly direct.

I really fucking despise women. All of them.
why discriminate.
everyone is shit.
I really fucking despise women
I agree
I despise men more than women.
I expect nothing less from the parasite that is assigned their sex as female.
Men with higher social status, are much more ruthless when degrading their inferiors.
Sure a foid is rude when she doesn't want to fuck, who gives a fuck, that's how woman work.
Our natural competitoon is other men, and those higher make sure that their inferiors know their absolute low rank on the social hiearchry.
How many women can reason effectively?
Now men, they no their words will often be met with physical confrontation if degrading another man, and when they know they can get do it, with society backing them, their words hold much, much, more weight, and let you know that you're shit, and you can't do anything about it because you're a nobody weakling.
Brotherhood is rarely forged, a single pussy enters a male space, and everyone forgets their whole blackpill incel bullshit.
The nobles and the peasants.
The question is how to become a noble, and not prop up another noble's harem, while you're plowing the fields.
Slowest method is to just stop playing the game altogether.
Why even bother?
Game's rigged since the inception of the universe.
I don't believe in determinism, but the dice was rolled perfectly just for you to become scum and the last man to pass on your name.
Too numb to give a shit.
I have my own goals.
Incels reject me, and pussy can be bought, like it has been since the beginning of civilization.
I just like shitposting. It'll all rot, eventually...

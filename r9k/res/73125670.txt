Would you use a public open urinal /r9k/?
<comment>
pisses with the force of a thousand suns
<comment>
I've used them at a music festival I was dragged too. These one's are practically luxury in comparison because they go above waist height
<comment>
i cover every surface in piss
<comment>
might as well piss on those trees like a dog if you want me exposing myself in public 
that's fucking nasty
<comment>
At that point, just piss in an alleyway. It's less exposed.
<comment>
oi you got a pissin' loicense mate?
<comment>
I have paruresis so I can barely piss in any public place, so no chance of going here.
<comment>
I want to go sit there and open my mouth fuck
<comment>
if i was drunk enough and had to piss yeah
<comment>
If it weren't for the rampant metoo shit, this would be useful
<comment>
This is definitely some fetish stuff. Why are wypipo like this?

I used to have pretty bad paruresis; started doing gradual exposure therapy and it really helped. One of the biggest things for me was counting to 45 seconds at the urinal; whether I go or don't go, I'll still stand there for 45 seconds. It really helped take the pressure off.

I really want to drink strangers piss, I would creep on guys using it for sure
<comment>
I want to try this
I think I have it too, where you cant pee if other ppl are nearby and whatnot
What do you mean exposure therapy? Like flashing people?

How come Naruto is watchable but bleach is not as an adult? Both are shonen garbage from the same era.
Tried watching Bleach a few months ago and just had to drop it after the Soul Society arc (skipping the Bount of course). Takes like 4 episodes for the plot to take a half-step and the fights aren't even cool. At least Naruto had some kino fights and interesting characters.
I got to the part where ichigo got his soul reaper powers and stopped. Just too hokey for me.
You should not be watching either
Its not just cartoons.
Not sure but Naruto at least has hotter girls and cool village living.
Naruto actually has good characters and plots/motivations, it's just in vogue to hate it to be contrarian
If you mean Naruto Part I then I agree 
but Bleach (ALL CANON ARCS) destroys Shippuden
I watched both of them when they came out in english dub (2005 for Naruto Part I) and (2006 for Bleach) 
Bleach is way cooler and has hotter girls. Fuck what the other anon in this thread said (All they got is Tsunade and the fifth Mizukage) 
Also, it has one of the greatest soundtracks out of all the 90s-2000s shounen anime 
I have the opposite feeling on rewatch. Naruto is way too childish and Shippuden is so bland and sterile that it makes me pissed off
Dude every girl that is intentionally hot in Naruto is hot.
Can't disagree with that, but it's still slim pickings compared to Bleach where the mangaka goes out of his way to make all the female characters very hot or cute
Canonically the only one thats really hot is rangiku.

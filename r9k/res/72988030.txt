Go to hell you imbecile.
Muslim guy in work would "pray" for around 2+ hours every shift, would always wait until its busy and then just walk off
Turns out he was just sitting in the toilets on his phone most of the night
Manager said nothing because that would be racist
Praying doesn't take that long (all the 5 prayers throughout the day won't cost you 2 hours). You can check the islamic prayer times and the time he left.
Islam has nothing to do with race so your manager is nothing but a retard who goes with the flow.
they did try to figure it out with the guy but anytime he was pulled by a manager he just rang the police

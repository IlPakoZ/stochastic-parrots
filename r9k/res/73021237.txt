Paying 100k for college
lol americucks are always fucked it seems.
3 year course
around 28k in loans (Tuition, living expenses, books, everything)
Got hired in field right out of grad
Now earning 100k a year
Also anyone who wastes money on college for the party aspect are just as retarded as any stupid normie.

It's called community college and state universities. I'm going to finish my 4 year degree having only spent about $10,000. And no, most normies don't know how to be frugal.

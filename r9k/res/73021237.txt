If you went to college you're an automatic normalfag and have zero excuse to be on here
A literal NPC who can afford to give an institution over $100,000 for 4+ years of partying and being near people while pretending to study for a useless paper because society said you had to lmao just kill yourself already

Also anyone who wastes money on college for the party aspect are just as retarded as any stupid normie.
It's called community college and state universities. I'm going to finish my 4 year degree having only spent about $10,000. And no, most normies don't know how to be frugal.
I started college on full tuition state scholarship and realized like halfway through second semester of my first year I fucking hate classrooms and professors and am going to community college for welding in the fall
who can afford to give an institution over $100,000 for 4+ years

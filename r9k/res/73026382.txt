Incels are becoming 'more extreme' online as they ratchet up their violent and misogynistic rhetoric, a study has found.
Researchers analysed millions of posts across the network of forums known as the 'incelosphere' over the past six years.
As the biggest social media sites clamped down on incel activity, members moved away from them to more secretive platforms that were harder to shut down.
It was on these that the discussions became far more dehumanising and dangerous, with the levels of violent extremist language increasing fourfold.
The incel movement - short for 'involuntary celibate' - is an online subculture that celebrates a misogynistic worldview and is promoted by young men angry at women for their lack of sex.
Plymouth shooter Jake Davison, who killed five people in 2021, shared his own hate-filled views on incel forums on social media platform Reddit.
Reddit moved to ban its largest forum for incels in 2017 after it drifted from a support group for men struggling to find a relationship to far more misogynistic content including rape threats.
The study - which looked at the incelosphere between 2014 and 2022 - found users had begun migrating to other online spaces where they were using 'more misogynistic and racist language'.
Professor Stephanie Baele from the University of Exeter said: 'We have found clear evidence of a greater volume of incel discussion online over time, including an increasing use of dehumanising labels and words depicting violence.'
Similar research carried out last year found nearly 1,000 references to dehumanising misogyny or violent action are recorded each day in the 'incelosphere'.
The analysis, also by the University of Exeter, found online references to inflicting violence and extremely degrading language on incel forums was eight times higher than in 2016.

When I was younger 18-23 I was manwhore. Manipulate asshole, just to get willy wet. I was switching women like socks. Luckily I never fucked club whores, but innocent young house women. My body count is with 24 different women. 
Never cared or thought anything about STDs. Never got anything. Had tested for all, when I put stop of it all. Now thinking back I didn't just play with matches, but placed my hand in deep fire and didn't got burned. Tell me about luck.

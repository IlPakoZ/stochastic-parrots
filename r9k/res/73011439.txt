be me
senior year of high school 
There was this cute Asian girl I was into and talking regularly 
 she was a very shy, super nerdy Autistic virgin, much like myself
towards the end of the school year my friend who is a chad got me and her an invite to a house party
 I don't see her for most of the party
 I go upstairs to use the en-suite bathroom in the master bedroom
 walk in on her getting railed by the most stereotypical jock looking guy ever
 die inside
Don't think I've ever tried to pursue a woman again after that, damn I felt my soul leave my body
I say this with the upmost amount of empathy, your mistake was thinking she owed you anything.

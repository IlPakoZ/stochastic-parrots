Literally all I want in life is to get married and have a child with a girl similar to this. Life might be a fucking illusion and the universe a pointless cesspit but that kind of domestic bliss would make living worth it to me. Unfortunately the possibility it'll eventually happen seems increasingly hopeless to me with each passing year. God I wish I was born a decade or two earlier. Maybe I'd have a shot if I didn't grow up with the internet brain fucking us all.

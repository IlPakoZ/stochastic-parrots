Champagne socialist imagining a world where impossible technology has made anarcho-communism viable and masturbating furiously to the thought.

i dont think you've read it. i think you read a bunch of potted summaries of the culture universe and are innocent of the bits where they're paternalistic jackoffs to everyone they deem inferior

I love that book. The chair made me cry. (Assuming I am not mixing it up with Player of Games, which I also loved).

it made me mad coz of how unfair it was

Well, you're wrong, nigger, I've read all the Culture novels.

First of all, ESL, the word there would be "ignorant", not "innocent", second - Banks is quick to pretend the Culture's lifestyle would appeal to everyone and naturally rub off on everyone they meet (other than the Affront) because to him it's a representation of the modern progressivism that's been forced on the West. But he died of ass cancer to soon to see how hard America's attempts at exporting modern progressivism failed, or their graceless retreat from Afghanistan (which the Idirans are clearly based off of).

first of all, GED holder, it was a reference to the line in Macbeth "be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck", the implication being you are ignoring it on purpose. second, if you hate them so much why did you read them all

So, ESL, I'm going to let you in on a little secret: Shakespeare's work is rife with grammar errors. If you use it as a guide on English, you'll always reveal yourself to be the English-as-a-second-language subhuman that you are, if the lack of capitalization wasn't enough already.

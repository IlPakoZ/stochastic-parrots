As a victim, or as a criminal suspect? Did it go alright for you?
Both 
No 
It was dark and they started beating and kicking me before arresting
When being arrested for an imagined charge, the police officer asked my name. I was so flabbergasted I didn't register that anyone had asked me a question. He said if I kept acting like that I'd get shot. Police don't even carry guns in my country. 10/10 experience.
Both, and yeah was alright. 
No complains about or trouble with them really, just with the shitstains that caused the disruption.
They are also hiring some really qt girls around here, which is as deeply worrisome as it is nice to observe.
no but a few years ago my mom received a letter from the police because what I was watching was too fucked up or something like that
never heard anything from them again but I still think about it (I was scared shitless at first)
and no I never watched cheese pizza (exept one time but I was 12 at the time so doesn't count)
what strain of retard uses whatsapp text messages to communicate with their dealer?
topkek, I'm unironically in South Africa and thinking about joining the police. Is it a good idea y/n?
What did you watch, then? Do you have any idea?
I ran from the police once. I was smoking weed with some friends in public and a cop car pulled over. As soon as the guy got out I sprinted off.
Dangerous, mediocre pay, no upward mobility. Go for it dude.
I really don't know 
maybe loli hentai ? but it's just drawings who cares
Being a policeman is literally being a gangster with a badge.
mental health visit - treated like a criminal
Mind you, I had never had an encounter with the police in my life. There was nothing on my record - not even a speeding warning or ticket. They escalated the situation and were immediately hostile when they entered the house. It's the exact opposite behavior you'd want to do with someone who is actually suicidal. If someone was actively suicidal, they'd likely resist and go for the suicide by cop option.
this is intentional, they want people to kill themselves rather than seek help.
One time during peak covid I left the house to shop for groceries and a couple approached me about not wearing a mask. I was a hikki-neet at the time and wasn't even aware that they wanted people to wear masks as I don't watch the news. They made a big deal about wanting to talk to me outside and then took my name down "in case I did it again" and gave me a mask. They acted like they were just being friendly and that they did my a favour by not arresting me. I bought some masks in the shop and when I got home I googled it so I wouldn't have this happen again... There were zero legal requirements or restrictions on wearing or not wearing a mask. The government suggested wearing one but wasn't punishing people for not wearing one.
Another time was when like two dozen cops entered the house searching for a drug lords operation. They brought a bunch of guys in body armour, sniffer dogs and helicopters... and discovered my older brothers three sad little marijuana plants. They searched everyone's rooms and asked us all questions and confiscated his trees...and completely missed his baggies of pot on his bed. My little brother and dad got hit with drug production charges because they admitted to watering the garden (where his plants were).
lets just say the more i deal with cops the more i dislike them.
I've had a few car accidents so yeah. Week before last I got rear ended.
Also I had to talk to a detective when my grandma got murdered.
fight whit mom
after that i needed to go to the psych ward every 3 months bc they think that i was an abuser or some shit
tought sry for bad inglish
Drug stuff a couple times when I was a kid. First time I was driving like a retard because I was a self-destructive teenager on way, way too much Xanax. He just thought I was stoned, so I got a distracted driving thing. Even then, that was only because I "lied" to him (told him I hadn't smoked, amended it to "I took an edible" when I put together what was happening and did some risk analysis).
Went off to college. Got busted for smoking in my dorm, had to take some bullshit substance abuse thing at the health center.
Overall, I guess I was just a retarded, nonthreatening teenager who got lucky a couple times
Can't hate the police. Were more than human and compassionate to me.

bought jeans from vintage shop
turns out to be woman's jeans when i got home
cant really return to vintage shop, didnt offer receipt
thinking of going in with them in my backpack, trying on a men's pair (of equal value) and swapping them in the changing room (no security tags or anything)
am i autistic for thinking this is good/fine?
<comment>
Hope they are paying you extra lid
<comment>
Yesterday was *definitely* the last bullshit appointment i've turned up to at the other locale
The fat retard didn't even wait for me at the entrance either as we had arranged, then when i went in by mself the fucking thing was packed with assorted pakis as well and stuff
Best part though was when this semi-retarded fat hideous middle-aged woman that was supposed to give me some information on [redacted] came running in like five or six times within a span of less than 10 minutes; Bitch just kept running in and out of the office like a 6 year old that just OD'd on ritalin or sommet, shit was extremely irritating and unsettling. 
Then the fucking phone in there kept ringing every other minute too. I had to actually tell the guy that her behaviour was making me hugely uncomfortable for him to tell her to cut it out. 
Before the bitch finally settled down properly and started talking in earnest i had to spend another solid 20 minutes or sommet watching the fat retard scroll through random shit on his screen since he was (again, just like at the other office earlier) too stupid to print out my doc which he had just scanned. These people are all incompetent morons squatting on state-subsidized meme positions.
Hugely frustrating waste of time overall, it's extremely fucking unlikely i'll be turning up there again next month lol
<comment>
I'm tempted to message her just to see if it's the same copy/paste reply
<comment>
people still wear jeans? i only ever wear joggers
<comment>

Been awake since Wednesday morning me.
<comment>
Congratulations! Fuck off!
<comment>
Realizef today I look VERY VERY good with buzzcut and stubble / beard. My facial hair just has to grow out a bit morr fuller to complete this. Also good omen for when I start going bald because I know I will look damn good still If I keep looking after myself and not go nutz on booze and junk food like HHL.
I genuinely would give myself an 8.5 out of 10. Sadly it probably cannot truly make up for the fact of my sub-standard height.
<comment>
It my world. You're just living in it x
Cheers x
<comment>
Id give myself a 6/10 but im a mess. Could breach 7 and even close to 8 if I lived good. Probably will look like a kicked in vegetable in 5 years time because of me lifestyle heh
<comment>
Had them chicken wings at spoons earlier. They are lush. And I mean LUSH x
<comment>
Really need to take the dashcam for a 2nd test drive soon
Shit just keeps escalating now, so many NPC retards clogging everything up again outside w/the warmer temperatures
Careless cunt mothers with their offspring running about, dog owners and boomers are the worst. They almost never yield or move to the side on their own and don't pay attention to their surroundings properly
<comment>
he's doing the "it my world" routine again
pathetic
<comment>
dossers only wear joggers. classic job centre dress.

<comment>

<comment>
Why are you pretending you've been awake for so long? Honestly curious mate.
<comment>
HHL and sound spacker have boyh been unusually toxic recently.
<comment>
Who's pretending. I've literally been awake since yesterday morning. And that's without wokey.
<comment>

<comment>
joggers are what you wear in the house then you switch to jeans when you go out
<comment>
Feel wissed again me. Not wrinking again until Sunday agter tonight x
<comment>
IDGAF I'm posting it again I made the picture today, it is OC and I think it looks great.
De lids... why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night I can feel my leg and my arm... even my fingers... the 90's I've lost... the raves I've lost... won't stop hurting. It's like they're all still there. You feel it too, don't you? I'm the one who got caught up with the Dorset County Council. A council above stores, even Greggs. And I was the parasite below, feeding off the council's power. They came after us in /bant/... then /britfeel/... the council... just keeps growing. Swallowing everything in its path. Getting bigger and bigger... Who knows how big now? My lids, I'm gonna make 'em give back our neetbux... take back every drink that we've lost. And I won't rest... until we do.
<comment>
Just ordered the webab x
We all wungry in life x

<comment>
Holy shit lads! Holy shit. I was about the mop the floor and leave but I realized instead of the regular mops we had these new dogshite ones that make it so much harder. I thought I had missed the bus and had to wait in the pissing cold with wet wollocks. 
But when I walked to the bus stop I saw the last one driving up so I pumped me little legs as hard as I could and I actually got it. No overpriced taxi bollocks.
GET IN! GET IN! GET IIIIN!!

<comment>
Gf w/the horny pictures again phwoar

<comment>
Poleaboo is still here, sometimes. But the overall quality of absolutely everything is much, much worse and you'd do better to remain blissfully ignorant. And no we don't get new OP images, we use random towns and sometimes a seethy image.
<comment>
Receiving some sexy pictures, posting on 4chan that I "better check those out", then checking out the sexy pictures

She makes me feel like a teenager again.

<comment>
at 1am, apparently 40 hours into his drinking session, he has suddenly decided to invent a new lass that he is in love with to garner further attention, having made zero mention of her at all until now
<comment>
Mate, go to bed. Honestly.
<comment>
Eye contact is everything x
<comment>
You know what they say, eyes are the windows to the soul x
<comment>
Thing about her is that she puts a massive smile on me face whenever I think of her.
<comment>
Do the bit where you say you "know where you stand now" because you try to sound like a film character when you're pissed
<comment>
This is some of the most transparent LARPing I've seen in a long time, fucking hell get a grip will you?
<comment>
You know they say, never turn a good thing down. Looks like this gonna happen de lids.
<comment>
I would message her now if it wasn't during the middle of the night.

Sorry they're dating 18 y/o Chad's with gay parted hair and tiny wrists (me)
<comment>
Does that inclued your love of old man cock in your arse

<comment>

<comment>
i'm sure he'd do well on grindr
<comment>
This girl that makes sean smile, is she on the older side and also a bit male?
<comment>
Maybe you should stop jerking off and learn more about the phenomenon of parasocial relationships.
<comment>
Sean loves OAPs

Vapington still going strong cooooor
<comment>
Would you clear all your vidya for pussy?
<comment>
Just save it up for big purchases then. No point spending it just because if you can pirate for free. Although Resident Evil 4 is taking it's sweet time being cracked. Might end up having to buy it if it goes on sale.
<comment>
I used to save money thinking I'd be going places but then I got depressed. So started being more of a consoomer.
<comment>
Aww fuck got two cans left. Garn rapid fire them. Thinking bout dem beddingtons now x
<comment>
Haven't been on a nightwalk in a long time. It's just sad really going on them.
<comment>
Coke Zero is my alcohol.
<comment>
Tastes too chemically for me. Not as bad as Diet though. Pepsi Max is my sugar free cola drink of choice
<comment>
I have a drinking problem de lids x
<comment>
Its ok mate just have yet another fresh start
<comment>
Need to replace one addiction with a healthier one. Get a bag in lad
<comment>
True de lid. Fresh start tomorrow. Garn have a break with the wooze for a while.
<comment>
It's gotten better than what it originally was. I actually only like the regular Pepsi. The Max one gives me stomach ache.
<comment>
Hmm not tried it for 4 years or so, maybe I'll give it a go. I bloomin love regular Coca Cola though, but I'm also getting old and want to keep my teeth so I've cut it right back. Still best feeling ever drinking after eating something incredibly salty/fatty though.
<comment>
NATIONAL COMRADES
<comment>
It tastes more like the regular one now but that's just my opinion. It's great after some spicy food.
<comment>
Like regular and without the teeth rotting?
Don't do this to me lad... Definitely gonna get some cans in now.

I can't cook lads. Everytime I try to fry burgers, the outside gets all black before the inside is done and I'm only using medium heat
<comment>
Speaking of borgs. Why is it so hard to find good sesame buns these days
<comment>
Sames need a break from mr wooze but I know I'll be back on it within 48 hours so no point lying to meself.

<comment>
zoomers love the 90s and vhs filters. they won't admit it but they have no culture.
<comment>

Gooooooood morning /britfeel/ and happy Friday to me fellow wagies. What's everyone's weekend plans then? Me? I'll be gardening and getting in to GTA online for the first time in years.
<comment>
Getting a haircut today, and need some MrMuscle for me bathroom sink
Want to go to the gym as well but I'm such an idle fucker
<comment>
who cares if they are women's jeans lad? you didn't have a problem with them when you put them on in the shop. 
t. worn womens jeans for years as do plenty of other lads
<comment>
I got some mr muscle right here 
smirks and flexes
<comment>
poley spent the whole night making photo copies
<comment>
Saw this on another forum and really made me chuckle
<comment>
Right. Let's sort the buyers from the spyers, the needy from the greedy, and those who trust me from the ones who don't, because if you can't see value here today, you're not up here shopping. You're up here shoplifting. You see these goods? Never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite. Fanny by the gaslight. Take a bag, c'mon take a bag. I took a bag home last night. Cost me a lot more than ten pound, I can tell you. Anyone like jewelry? Look at that one there. Handmade in Italy, hand-stolen in Stepney. It's as long as my arm. I wish it was as long as something else. Don't think because these boxes are sealed up, they're empty. The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you lot today, I'd make more money with me measuring tape. Here, one price. Ten pound
quickly popping in to say I hope my lovely lads are happy and smiling and I shaaaaant be drinking or posting here this weekend 
Cheers x
<comment>
Thanks lad, decided to upgrade my 2014 pc

My line manager and I get on well, and she's barely in the office. She was supposed to come in today and I was dreading it. Simply because I therefore can't listen to my tunes. She's not and I'm the only soul in the office, not even a receptionist. Comfy rainy day in Central London.

Anyone else planning a good ol' goon today?

Went a bit nuts on the darknet markets yesterday. The gf wanted some valium as she gets a bad back, so I took that as an excuse to buy myself a bunch of treats. Got some opioids, hash, cocaine and ketamine coming now. Suppose may is looking to be a fun month. Just can't help myself really.

Why would politicians do that?
This isn't our country, if it was, it would function how we want it to.
Until we get rid of this defunct corrupt political system, nothing will change. Why would they want to change it? It suits them just fine. No come back for lies, do what you want. What is their incentive for changing things?
Don't try and say to do the right thing.

Yeah she needs it for muscle relaxant properties, she can get them prescribed but it's considerably cheaper to get 20 10mg pills for 20 quid, than get 10 2mg pills for a tenner from the doctor.

We don't know if it's flid, his mum might be fed up of finding pieces of shit on her monster dildo, and want to find the source.

I just found out that Trayvon Martin's giant fat ugly dumb girlfriend testified under oath that she wrote a letter explaining the situation to his mum, but then in court when she was asked to read it she said she 'couldn't read cursive'.
These progressive wankers have absolutely no shame, the rules are optional to them and virtues like telling the truth are confusing at best and actively hated at worst.

Senior network engineer, just like looking at the little screen on my breaks from looking at the medium sized screens, and while watching TV on the big screen with the fiance. Work from home today so taking it easy like Friday afternoon
<comment>
stop being a shut-in
actually make friends
still a NEET and constantly broke, but it's a step up
slowly notice all the ways in which my friends have lived full and fulfilling lives while i've wasted mine.
slowly notice all the basic things that they're capable of doing because their parents raised them properly and their schools weren't hellholes
start feeling just as bad as i did when i was a shut in, only without the hope it's going to get better one day.
<comment>
That's when you discover your parents have hidden a camera to check up on you and make sure you don't kill yourself or try to fuck the dogs

Ariella Ferrera and Diamond Kitty
Both crazy energy latina beauties, very good porn performers, have a few choice scenes from them (especially early brazzers Diamond Kitty ones)
<comment>
It did get better, and still is, don't let rumination rule your life. You changed and made a big improvement on your life. I think that is a good achievement.
<comment>
You owe me rent
<comment>
Okay, you've convinced me, I've set up a goon folder and will populate it with stuff that gets posted here, then when I feel like I've got a decent amount I'll do some exploratory goon sessions and report back.
<comment>
I'd say out of the two of us, you're more inclined to becoming a rent boy.
<comment>
Are gooning and crossdressing linked, or can you do 1 without the other?

My plan to put Britain right
no more immigration 
end foreign aid
bring back the death penalty 
enforce the law toughly
bring back traditional marriage
benefits only for those that need it
schools are to be places of education 
doctors given proper training
abolish 90% of universities in favour of apprenticeships 
get Britain reading again. If you read 25 books you get a boost to your benefits/a tax cut

The rest is just the standard power fantasy stuff but in what world could you verify how many books someone has read?
<comment>
Hate Isle of Man
Fuck
<comment>
The benefit boost/tax credit will be less than the value of the books, so there would be no incentive to just buy books for the sake of it
<comment>
no more immigration
Yep
end foreign aid
Yep
bring back the death penalty
Yep
enforce the law toughly
Yep
bring back traditional marriage
We still have it, it's just we also have gay marriage. Instead: abolish gay marriage and straight couples get tax cuts which increase over time to reward long-term stable families. Also make infidelity a crime which brings hefty fines and community service hours while wearing a sign that says "I was an unfaithful spouse" or something.
benefits only for those that need it
Not a fan of this - technically the welfare system we have now is for 'those that need it' yet it's obviously not the case. Needs to be way tougher.
schools are to be places of education
Yep, though education should be something closer to the trivium, with clearly able students offered additional education and those that aren't able being tracked into apprenticeships
doctors given proper training
They are given proper training already, it's just that the BMA places a cap on the number of doctors/nurses that unis are allowed to train per year. Literal insanity, the BMA must be disbanded and unis allowed to open placements to as many candidates as they want
abolish 90% of universities in favour of apprenticeships
Yep. Keep any degrees that are basically technical trade on-boardings and disband the rest. Seize the endowments and the properties.
get Britain reading again. If you read 25 books you get a boost to your benefits/a tax cut
Kinda gimmicky and unenforceable. Universal literacy is neither achievable or, frankly, desirable.
<comment>
suggestion: place the 25 books at the end of an obstacle course and set the disabled in front of it
there should be tests
<comment>
make infidelity a crime which brings hefty fines and community service hours while wearing a sign that says "I was an unfaithful spouse" or something.

<comment>
Inshallah he will not
<comment>
Why is it mental? Plenty of countries and societies had infidelity as a crime for hundreds of years. Cheating ruins marriages and families and is a generally horrifically immoral thing to do, so why not punish it and deter people at the same time? Social shaming is very effective to prevent recidivism - see Singaporean child weight loss programs.

<comment>
why do you blame other people for your own ignorance? have you even read 25 books?
<comment>
Aftergoon would suggest there is an end to the goon, since it's after goon. There is no end. There is just goon. Afternoon.

<comment>
I had LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge on my Game boy Colour back in the day
<comment>
Yeah that was a great one. They took it down because brazzers is a big company and didn't want the hassle of the Pornstar Punishment scenes being seen as 'too rough' and get the site shut down. However you can still find complete siterips of it online. Have a few scenes tucked away somewhere. 
You remember when brazzers teased a scene called 'Romains of the Day'? It was Sandra and Alice Romain, the sisters, in an anal threesome with Danny D in the back of a limo, but the scene never got released because the brazzers management thought it pushed the boundary into incest too far. My god to get my hands on that scene...

I'd keep up hygiene if I had a purpose and good relationships.
<comment>
Oh yeah I've been on pornolab for years now, but no luck. I legit think they just deleted the master copy to avoid any issues. Was very unhappy when brazzers nuked their own site. A full third of their videos or something got taken down for not much reason, it's not like some scene that's a decade old is suddenly gonna get the police knocking at their offices or anything.
I think they're in a bit of a rut right now anyway, only a few scenes from them pique my interest now and a lot of the best stars currently active don't get work with them. I remember back in sort of the early to mid 2010s when they'd get tons of proper A-listers doing multiple scenes a month for them. Shame how it's a bit stale now with unimpressive talent.

The gold-digging gf escalated her sneakyarse schemes to a considerable degree again out of the blue earlier while on call too; This is one of the topics she was more or less fixated on since the beginning. Hillariously enough she denies being a golddigger too of course. Says she doesn't want to "lose her standard of living" or whatever - I'm like bitch please, you live in one of the continent's poorest cunts by far and your "job" consists of logging into some meme gig economy app on the reg and LARPing as a [redacted] on there. 
But these deluded wahminoids always think they have to monkeybranch and/or cheat after a while, in order "to do better" - Until their SMV finally runs out completely and it's too late for them/only the lowest quality bottom of the barrel-type men show interest in them. 
She even lampshaded the whole cat lady thing too and then went full schizo saying that "God perhaps doesn't want me to have a partner/become a mother so i can be more spiritual"... Like yeah, you keep coping and telling yourself that and see how your golddigging and chadfishing works out for you 5 years or so from now when you're nearing your 40s lmao. The bitch has issues with getting pregnant and is already hitting the wall even now, it sure as hell won't get any easier for her down the line.
Anyways she then finally got around and said that she'll """need more time""" to ascertain whether a long distance relationshit with regular week-long meetups once a month would work for her or not after all. Told her to think long and hard about it before making her choice and what have you. 
But eh, there's a 98,5% chance it'll crash and burn thanks to her shit now/when i get up again and check back later for one last time. Mentally i've "closed the file" already as it were and am ready to move on, just waiting on the formal confirmation now.
Still glad i saw this thing thru though; Really really had to get me schwong wet again after all this time. And wet it has gotten...

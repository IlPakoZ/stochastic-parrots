Don't let your physical appearance get you down and stop you from accomplishing great things.
Donald Trump is one of the strangest looking human beings, and he took over the world.
He was good looking in his 20s 30s only let himself go after he accomplished and fucked everyone
Also
Trump is over 6ft tall. And in his youth was handsome enough for a preppy school boy. He was raised from birth to be successful.
Chinese century tho
6'3"
It's like you're not even trying, OP
the donald literally became a president, that's enough to make you good looking
I guess it at least says that you can have everything else going for you and just not care about your physical appearance.
This is Scott Storch.
Another person that looks like a geriatric grandmother that got a "hip young haircut" to try and look young again.
Scott Storch is responsible for producing "probably about 100" of the biggest smash hits of the 2000s. Dr. Dre, Beyonce, 50 Cent, Christina Aguilera, Sean Paul, Justin Timberlake and a bunch of other giant stars.
If you heard a big song on the radio that had an element of hip hop in it in the 2000s, there's a good chance that this guy was behind it.
Scott Storch once had a net worth of "about 50 million dollars".
Scott Storch doesn't let him being
1. White
2. Like 5'6
3. Generally looking like an absolute poindexter
Stop him from being a hip-hop mogul with a diamond chain that shakes hands with people like 50 Cent and rules the world with a keyboard.
Because when you're this good at something you just can't be bothered to care about anything.
Reminds me of Dr Luke. He even wears the same necklace.
Of course looks dont matter when you have everything else!
recently everytime i'm reminded of this dude i think of another guy with the same name. he was so cute it's retarded and now i'm mad i never told him he was cute

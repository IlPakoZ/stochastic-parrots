tfw "you" believe in the self
<comment>
the self what?
<comment>
Seeing "yourself" as separate is just an arbitrary perspective.
Even the distinction between being and nothingness is arbitrary.

I am holistic and therefore individual. I can sense my anatomy so I am that.

If there is no self, then what is it that perceives the illusion?

picrel can control the cane
picrel can sense the world through the cane
Is the cane part of the blind man?
tfw "you" are picrel

to be more precise you should say being and non-being, not being and nothingness.

Very originally forgot to attach.

It's not in any way more precise, but it is stylistically superior.

So you're arguing that someone with a metal bone replacement or prosthetic limb is less human? It's all semantics but the self is a clear differential to other "selves" regardless of your game you want to play.
<comment>
I mean, it's more precise in that non-being is directly signified as the negation of being. nothingness is more like the transcendental unity of being and non-being, at least in my understanding.
<comment>
The distinction between self and environment (spatial) or even from lineage (temporal) is arbitrary. As said above, even distinctions between being and non-being are arbitrary.
There's probably some eastern philosophy baggage to "nothingness", so fair enough.

Missed that post.
Is there an observer or a perspective? Another arbitrary distinction.

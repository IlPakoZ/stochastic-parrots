the self what?
Seeing "yourself" as separate is just an arbitrary perspective.
Even the distinction between being and nothingness is arbitrary.
I am holistic and therefore individual. I can sense my anatomy so I am that.
If there is no self, then what is it that perceives the illusion?

Is the cane part of the blind man?

to be more precise you should say being and non-being, not being and nothingness.
Very originally forgot to attach.
It's not in any way more precise, but it is stylistically superior.
So you're arguing that someone with a metal bone replacement or prosthetic limb is less human? It's all semantics but the self is a clear differential to other "selves" regardless of your game you want to play.
I mean, it's more precise in that non-being is directly signified as the negation of being. nothingness is more like the transcendental unity of being and non-being, at least in my understanding.
The distinction between self and environment (spatial) or even from lineage (temporal) is arbitrary. As said above, even distinctions between being and non-being are arbitrary.
There's probably some eastern philosophy baggage to "nothingness", so fair enough.
Missed that post.
Is there an observer or a perspective? Another arbitrary distinction.

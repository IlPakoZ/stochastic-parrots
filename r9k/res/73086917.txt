What is the benefit of being a man if I've always been thin, weak, and emotional?
It's scary to see guys on here usually go
yea being a dude sucks but at least I can like hit stuff and fuck women haha
There has to be more to it right?
I mean, I'm tall at least. Should I learn to care about being seen as smart or capable or whatever? How?

I wouldn't call them benefits but rather difference in conditions and set terms that you are allowed, expected, and sometimes encouraged to live by, determined by both biology and society.
Each gender plays their role and usually accepts their perks and cons. As a man you are trading additional burdens of life on your shoulders for greater physical and emotional strength potential, as well as generally much more possibilities and paths in life, leading both higher up and deeper down. Men make history, women stay at the kitchen, or at least that's how it's been for most of history.

Thin, weak and emotional man here. Nothing. You are essentially a woman except that is a 101% disadvantage as a man. Men are not allowed to be weak, expected to lead and carry and really all their value is how much value they can create. Weak men are despised by men and women. Faggots are somewhat a middle ground but even then you are expected to be competent. I'm tall too but it never mattered because I'm lacking everywhere else.

Hello fellow thin, weak, emotional dude, I have a solution. Put a skirt on (I know you are queer just by reading this shit) like I did, you wont regret it. 
Now if you want to blend in with your fellow dudes a bit better, get into a sport, you dont gotta play them, just watch em. NBA and NHL playoffs going on, or watch the premier league if youre a soccer fag.
See I play the system, wear a skirt and cardigan when not around other dudes, put on my trusty jersey when I am around them.

I've yet to see an influential woman that didn't gain her position trough blatant emotional or physical lure/manipulation, they were always about value to a man first, their own value to society second, at least from my perspective, there are exclusions from time to time ofcource.
Though considering how effeminate traits and behaviour are on the rise in the west, as well as feminism and 'equaliy', I wouldn't be surprised if more women got into positions of power simply because there is no masculine enough men left to fill those positions up.

Brutal. that's so sad, how is anyone fine with this

Is it queer to think about this? I'm so out of the loop... it's over.
I feel like I would consider doing this if my height wasn't an issue. Its made me insecure since I was a kid even though I've always been complimented for it
Fuck
I don't think men would like me as much as women just tend to because of the height issue
Isn't that just the best strat in such a world of soft power? I've mostly done the same in my life, I feel like it's just logical
Social and emotional manipulation is such a powerful tool if you know how to use it, but I try not to get carried away out of guilt

Bro I am 6 foot and like half an inch, you can find clothes, a flexible skirt that adjusts to your waist is easy to find on amazon, if you live in the US, try ross, they have a lot of shit for cheap, if you wanna splurge out, nordstrom rack. 
Also trust me, a lot of women will support you, when I go out cross dressing, I get infinitely more compliments from women about what I wear, they probably think Im trans and want to be supportive, but hey we take those.

It is. Just don't expect soft power alone to work in an environment that still values masculinity just as much, not to mention going off soft power alone puts you in a direct competition with women, which let's be honest, unless you are a great looking twink or a genius in both your professional field and fields of sociology - you aren't winning 9 times out of 10.

Also yes Im 100% tryna get you out of your shell cuz you are a thin queer ass mf who thinks they have no sense of masculinity. Get in the skirt dork.
<comment>
Aw well thank you anon sorry for being difficult, thank you
I'll give it some thought
that's true. I'm too autistic to really rely on it anyways. definitely have to put in more leg work intellectually, but I'm fine with that

I am a pretty chubby dude that used to lift a lot before my joints gave in. I became really cowardly and shit in after that.
Recently some guy threathened me with violence because I parked too close to his car, I played it cool and left and showed him the middle finger.
He chased me with his car and got out and threathened me more, I then told him to "stop talking and bring it on", removed my glasses and stepped a bit into his Direction. All of a sudden he didn't want to fight anymore.
I was scared and I was sure to get my ass beat, but I refused to meekly let this asscunt get his way. In the end he was an even bigger pussy than me.
I think sometimes you just gotta be dumb as a man?

Women still cannot rise to the height of a man can in most places, men are always at the top. Think like this, women love to bake and cook right, but why is it always a man in charge of a bakery and restaurant as head baker(chef? Of course this doesn't apply to every situation but it applies to most, men are usually in the highest positions of power. A lot of women also have a desire to have children, and they cannot have a career and child at the same time, they have to sacrifice one for the other, so old gender roles like the traditional woman still holds.
That's my take on it at least, but I don't really know anything.
Also, about you being think weak and emotional, you can change those things to an extent, no? I mean it's hard to become less emotional aka changing your personality but I'm sure you can be less emotional. I don't really see how it's a problem you that cannot fix.

I love my dog but he constantly pulls me on walks and has escaped my yard to attack people/other dogs multiple fucking times now. I love him so much and don't want to give him up but I need to either train him or say goodbye. He's not a shitbull so I definitely think it's possible to fix him.
I heard about the Koehler method. Internet soi blogs complain that it's too aggressive and mean for the dogs, but he's really THAT bad and aggressive. I'm not sure if anything less than military grade training will work on him. I'm willing to put all my time into this. I want to know if anyone here has trained dogs or works with dogs professionally and what they think of the Koehler method for my case. Keep in mind if I can't get this dog into tip-top shape in a few months, I will probably lose him OR he will end up killing someone's baby.

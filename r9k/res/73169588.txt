I'm having dreams in which Goetia demons come talk to me. They don't seem to be trying to scare me but their sole presence is menacing enough. 
Last night I woke up soaked in sweat and so frightened that I immediately began to pray - and I consider myself agnostic.
Well, either it's real, or you're going crazy.
How do you choose to cope?
You need to Goetiaself some bitches and stop trying to use demons to solve all your problems. We've got better shit to do than entertain you while you kill yourself slowly.
I'm agnostic and have never seen anything gay like a demon in my dreams. My nightmares are about real things like being locked in a small dark room and screaming and no one hearing me.
I don't know. I sincerely and wholeheartedly don't know what to make of it.
I don't mess with the occult. I just leave this kind of stuff be. Idk why I'm having those kind of dreams.
You might have pissed off some occultnigger.
Literally just ask for god's protection and they cant do shit. Demon worshippers are retarded.
why did she break my neck. why is she mad.
That's exactly what I plan to do. Last night I woke up to the feeling of having fingers in my nostril and someone holding my left hand. I prayed and eventually that shit was gone.
You'd do even better to stop pissing people off. People who dont hate you have a habit of not cursing you.
Giygas isn't a man made horror, he's an alien. Fail
Do you know which ones because if you know that you can contact them yourself and ask why they are in your dreams. Use the correct enn which is a phrase that connects you to the spirit and the right sigil of the being 
Be respectful and if need be offer a drink to them. Respect them and they will be usually happy to help but remember they need a gift or an offering which they will want you to give them on their sigil

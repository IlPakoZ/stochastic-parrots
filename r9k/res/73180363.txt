my brother is a plastic surgeon and would give me dirt cheap plastic surgery. Im not ugly at all, but it wouldnt look so bad having a little more size added to my chin
although, i fear that this will fuck things up. that by changing myself and having more of a chance among the chads and stacies, that Ill also lose the chance to connect with people on my level, who might have self esteem issues, or think more deeply about certain subjects (chad doesnt have to think deeply about anything lol). I am afraid that ill always lose a small part of me and become a little less genuine. I know that this ius probably all stupid, but what do you think? is there any validity to all this or should i just get my free chin implants and enjoy being a 7.5/10 instead of a 6?
Also, i actually like imperfections. its what makes people human. If someone has no imperfections i actually lose interest in them; ive never watched porn of a fucking model. Ive been told this is cope or something, but i dont think looking better will suddenly make me lose interest in the type of people i like. Could i just date people slightly below my league but still do this for the hell of it? or will the relationship dynamic be fucked up?
I think id be more okay with it honestly, if I already had a SO and we could looksmax together.

Plastic surgery for elective reasons shouldn't be legal.

Surgery is only really a good idea if you have 1 or two fucked up features but are otherwise good-looking. If you're mediocre all around, you can't just upgrade your whole face or whatever without looking giga uncanny. I mean in your case you only want to change your chin, and it's an implant that I am assuming could be removed, but why bother as a 6/10?

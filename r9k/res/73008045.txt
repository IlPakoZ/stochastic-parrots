Legend has it that men swipe left on single moms no matter how good looking or otherwise worthy they are. Could they be--gasp!--incel?
I'd be open to it but the problem is I'm a NEET
As an incel neet we're lower value to them as well
Iv'e swiped right on single moms and no dice. I'd give them a chance but I'm a bald lanklet and wristet, they can do better than that.

If you haven't learned by now to not do this then you aren't going to make it. end of story. you would be excused in 2014-2017. But now, no fucking way.
I know its bait but I'm saying it anyway.
Besides women not being incels. 
You can't be an incel if you're a parent. 
The fact that you got pregnant and had a kid means that you were attractive enough to be having sex.

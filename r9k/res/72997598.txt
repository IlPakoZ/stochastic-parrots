NEETs who get their housing/income from their family, what will you do when they pass away? Serious question.
i'll probably cross that bridge when i come to it
Be homeless. The entire system is made to make people productive for their gains. I don't plan to give in.
I'll get a job and if it's not enough for housing or I have a breakdown than I will go homeless
i may as well kms since i wouldnt have anything going for me anyway. im not tall, good looking, strong or even healthy in general
I would overdose on heroin.
It's very morbid to think about, but my father is quite wealthy and I will presumably get a sizable inheritance. That should hold me over while I invest it and live a minimal lifestyle until I die.
Study shows most NEETs usually suicide after their parents die like 80% of the time.
For me my family is wealthy enough i probably could survive without working til i die.
this question is a waste of time.
you either die or you work.
My parents had 7 kids 3 of them have already offered to let me live with them just to avoid living with my mother. My sister asked if I could be a stay at home nanny for my niece. If they all died I'd hope that would be motivation enough for me to get a job finally. I'm sure I could get some sympathy money from church and other friends of the family.
Work the bare amount needed. If I get a wageslave retail job I can get free food and maybe other gibs to make things even easier. I don't need much in life to be happy. I pirate everything and never buy new shit unless it's needed.
few people never work. Most NEETS live of their savings, then get a job for a few weeks/months. It works best if you're in a piss-poor country and work abroad.

yeah im gonna move out in 4 days
why are people with land/money always subhuman?
To thrive in that business you need to be a soulless financial predator who was born to rich parents, this is the nature of every succesful landlord
I hate them myself, i want to buy a (newly build) house to LIVE IN, ACTUALLY LIVE IN, but i get outbidded by someone who will rent it for a fuckton of money, i hate it, bunch of faggots, or i get outbidded by some old farts that for some reason want to live in newer houses when they will die in 10 years, this place stink

pay 400 euros a month for a 15m2 one room crackshack (thats like 600 inches or however americans say it)
landlord turns heater off cuz "its to expensive"
get an electric heater and use that instead to get trough winter (it was so cold you were able to see your breath i literally wore clothes and a ushanka at home)
goes into my room and takes it with him
yeah im gonna move out in 4 days
why are people with land/money always subhuman?

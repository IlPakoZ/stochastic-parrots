Canadian actor Saint Von Colucci is dead after dropping $220,000 for a dozen cosmetic surgeries so he could look like BTS star Jimin.
Can't say I'm sad.
Imagine spending 220K to look like an Oblivion NPC
this guy was retarded and needed psychiatric help but pretty sad to hear. the negative effects of social media on young people needs to be emphasized
At least he died with Chad hunter eyes. His original negative canthal tilt on the right is one of the worst I have ever seen.
Why do white guys keep getting surgery to try to look like Jimin kek, he is one of the ugliest members. The best looking members are Jungkook, Taehyung and Jin.
Only from certain angles and only in a few haircuts

nyeongie mogs them all in terms of looks, talent, sexiness, personality, dick size, thiccness, daddy material etc
Jimin Jungkook Taehyung Jin
bro what the FUCK even are korean names like holy shit
Would you rather prefer older Korean names like Noraritzy or Sobyeoldori
Well im certainly not stanning someone called Cooper, Dale, Gregory or Mike, kek.
they're literally like names you'd give to some racist cartoon caricature it's amazing women schlick to this shit
White male names are generally unattractive, because most of the are Anglo Saxon in origin.
god my nyeongie is gonna age like fine wine + be such a sexy dapper wine drinking stubbly silver foxy grandpa
That's some real funny shid.
Just realized it doesnt matter how your eyes look cuz we are all buried with our eyes closed in the end :|
He became Finnish
Hey baby~~

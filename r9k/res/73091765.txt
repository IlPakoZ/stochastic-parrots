Do you think it's possible to go back to highschool as a 28 year old? I don't mean that nightschool bullshit for people who never finished HS. I mean a real highschool with teenagers. I look very young when I shave. maybe with a hair transplant I could pass as a 18 year old. I could try to lie and pretend my parents just moved here and that I lost all my personal documentation or whatever. I have more life experience now and I'm taller so I could become one of the "popular" kids, get invited to parties, and so on. I could finally the live the "highschool experience" that was denied to me. Maybe I could just walk in one day with a backpack sit in a crowded classroom and pretend I just transferred in. Has anyone here tried something like this? could it work?

No, that phase of your life is long gone. Might as well think you can go back and suck on your mama's titties again.
You can still go back to college though.

Can you explain this?

So she won't date black guys, but gets angry when they date outside their race? What kinda sense does this make?

We have a lot of Colombians here in Florida, so it probably has something to do with where you live, bro.

Only attractive women get to date white men
the rest just seethe about black guys on lipstick all day.

She's either jealous or doesn't want black guys to date any type of girl because she dislikes them
she's okay with black women dating white guys tho, so she's a hypocrite

Most won't admit it, but black women have a major inferiority complex when it comes to white women. The girl in OP most likely prefers her own men but sees how many of her own men openly and explicitly prefer white women. Couple this with having to live in the western world where there are white women who barely wear make up and other extra shit and still mog you day in and day out and yeah, it probably hurts to see black men and white white women couples.
They celebrate white man black woman relationships because they recognize white men as being "better" men in theory even though they don't really want them. Seeing the wmbf couple affirms to these single internet dwelling black women that they aren't actually bottom of the totem pole. 
White people + black people dating dynamics are cringe as fuck. It's full of massive generalizations, fetishes, copes, and other toxic shit

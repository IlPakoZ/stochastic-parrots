Why are Korean names all the same?
They're not distinguishable like Japanese names
All Korean guys have the same spelled sounding names to me

Japanese names can look and sound cool, but theyre too long and confusing for me to remember.

because at one point everyone wanted to be like the elite of korea, which are a small number of people, so everyone adopted their last names, and they are kind of a conformist hivemind, so they just copy trends and dont think too critically

Sunday was the worst day at the moment because of the urges and because I basically have the habit of like fucking destroying my dick all saturdays. Yesterday were no problem.
Uhh.. IDK, at least I'm going to try for the month of no fapping, I actually want to stop fapping for the rest of my life but you know...
fapping isnt that problematic and can help release urges. there are legit benefits to masturbation. its porn thats a real problem and that shit is genuinely toxic. if you feel like you might relapse try wankin in the shower, without your phone.

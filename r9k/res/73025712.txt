can't believe how long it's been
we need to escape NEETdom anons, the future is dark for us if we continue living like this
come on, let's get a job...
No
There is no reward for busting my ass for this society
Women are whores, people are stupid, and the government knows it's losing influence so they're going full totalitarian on it's own citizens by the day
Comfy NEET life with as little social interaction as possible is the only way to live in this day and age if you can afford it
It's too late for me anon. Go and life your life. 
Live for yourself.
Why would you do that to yourself?
t. wagie
I just can't stand seeing my peers doing the things I always dreamed about while I ROT here...
I need money...
Why? There's nothing I want or hope for in the future. Money holds no appeal for me. If I lose my house then I'll probably just die. No great loss.
I have no fucking peers they're all stupid pop-culture obsessed drones
bitch i made a thread about advice for becoming a trucker in the EU and i got just a few replies
meanwhile fembot bait threads get hundreds of replies
I escaped it by joining the army. Now look at me a year out of the army with a good job and a dog girlfriend.
I have a trust fund with 8 mil in it. 
YOU need to get a job. 
I'm fine just chilling on my farm, indulging in autistic hobbies like woodworking, casting metals, and being terminally online. 
I just order everything in: groceries, clothes, whores. 
You go work for Zog until the war starts. I'll chill here and move to SEA and live like a king when the shtf.
You think you can just get away with saying something like that? Can you specify what you mean by that anon
the fact that you need to pay for sex and i dont means i have more genetic value than you
so i win, ultimately

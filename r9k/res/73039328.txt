- Better conversationalists than men. Their words very frequently give you a sense of actually communicating with someone, unlike men, the bottom 90% of whom literally grunt and fart as a substitute for speech while many of the top 10% of them are obsessed with "debating."
- Better attitude toward sex, actively enjoy foreplay and romance before sex, unlike men who prefer human-assisted masturbation.
- Deal with the crying children and dying elderly people and whining low status men and most of the other unpleasant things in the social realm.
- Aren't prone to harassing random strangers on the street for no reason.
- Aren't prone to committing serious crimes.

I'm not saying this to defend women, anon. I'm saying it because this way of thinking isn't good for you and only serves to make you feel worse. But your life, anon. Do whatever.

Batch stfu please and take you whining bullshit nonsense over to crystal Cafe where you and a bunch of other mid chicks can complain about how trash men are because you let Chad pump and dump you and now he won't talk to you anymore

why do men think they are entitled to womens compassion? if you have cancer and are dying what do you have to offer? nothing. people should not be sorry for prioritizing their happiness and well-being over someones elses

why do normies take pictures of themselves so much?
i see it on snapchat with the popular foids. they seem to take pictures every 10 minutes all day long. does that not get creepy or invading? i dont know if those foids actually get paid or what. 
i dont get why you would do that. just start taking pictures as soon as you wake up every day to post for a bunch of coomers.

OP later:
why is no one interacting with me on dating apps? billions must die

I hate looking at it too. I think its for validation from other people. Normies cannot live without validation from others. Every interest they have is naturally extrinsic

I post a couple because you are literally advertising yourself. 
I think as long as the picture is tasteful its alright. Maybe it helps you charm a stranger that will be important to you in your life, who knows.

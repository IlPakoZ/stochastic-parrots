a wizard named Brosnian offers to give you 10 million dollars
however, you must compete against nine other women
you have to tell him how much weight you're willing to gain for the money
if you give a weight below the nine others' offers, nothing happens to you, you gain no weight and win no money
if you give a weight above the nine others, you will put on all that weight AND win the money
How much would you be willing to bet? (Brosnian only lets biological women play.)
Tell him to make me 1500 lbs I don't give a shit if it kills me. If it doesn't I'll just go on a fast until I get back down to a healthy weight and live out however much time I have left in luxury, which might not be a lot after what this does to my heart. I want to win the money.
If you die you dont get the money
320 lbs
better idea
game show
prize is $10mm or whatever
contestants share a house for 4 months or so
they have to get as fat as possible
endless supplies of basic foods
have mini challenges for bonus supplements, guest chefs, or stuff like weed
every two weeks the skinniest girl is kicked out
at the end of the period the winner is the fattest girl remaining
imagine the lengths bitches would go trying to gain or how the would sabotage each other
It wouldn't be useful to you anyway lol.
I would do none of these. Dont care.
Id just tell something basic like 200 lbs and hope wizard kun fucks off. Im not competing with anybody for the right to be a fattest fuck in the world.
I bet a weight of googolplex to the power of googolplex to the power of googolplex to the power of googolplex so I can bloat up so big that I destroy the universe and possibly the multiverse and facesit God to death.
That sounds so sexy
Bump
God exists beyond material reality moron you cant crush him with your ass

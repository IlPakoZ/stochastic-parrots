everything you just typed out disgusts modern women. romance is a male only ideal that doesnt exist in the real world because women fiercely hate it.

Can't say I relate, but thanks for giving me ideas on what to do with my gf!

You don't have the strength to hold a relationship. Even if you do get a gf, she will leave your pathetic ass.

its all my fault bro, ive done so many bad things, committed so many sins, im intensely antisocial and im not tge most mentally stable person. i know i dont deserve a gf and i dont blame anyone but myself but fuck its still crushing
it makes me sad, modernity and 5th gen warfare are especially hard on women

cherish her and treat her right anon, dont fuck it up

This is a cope, I'm dating an actual feminist and even she likes it. We watched an 80s romance while cuddling the other day and then I fucked her in the ass while choking her

It's not too late, Anon. You may not be able to get a gf, but you can certainly work on improving yourself. That'll increase your chances of finding a girlfriend and it'll make anyone you end up with a lot happier if you're a fully put-together person at that point. Plus, even if you don't get a gf, there will be alternate ways that your improvement will better your life.
It's a lonely, hard path, but it works.

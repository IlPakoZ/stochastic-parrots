Man I hate being skinny. I can tell him actually getting physically stronger in the gym but I don't SEE results. Because I have lens and a body that is longer than usual it takes forever to actually see results. So some short dude can do maybe half the amount of work I put in and see results well I can hit the gym consistently for years and look the fucking same despite getting stronger. A lot of women claim that they like body type number two but why? I'm not sure if I even believe that you actually do because Don't you guys sort of hate weak looking guys? I don't understand why three or four wouldn't be ideal.

I want 2 and 8 to choke me

Stop bitching about being short. It's your personality
i don't understand. did you forget to remove this when you changed tactics on your bait post?
<comment>
That was intentional. Learn how to read. Dudes act like being short as a death sentence when it actually makes certain things easier, like building muscle. Women do not dislike them because they are short. They just like them because of their either repulsive or bland personalities. "Waaahh I'm short" it's just a cop out excuse to justify not improving

Stop being sorry for yourself and eat more faggot

Yep, I'm a tall 1, and building muscle is an absolute nightmare. Convinced I have a hormone problem at this point.
The fact I frequently forget to eat is probably also part of it, but still.

I've literally had a woman tell me that I'm too short for most girls

mfw 1 with 8's gut
No matter how much I eat, it's always like this. For fuck's sake, I just want some meat on my bones, not just my belly.

Would 1-5

right, so women don't care about height, but they care about your body in other ways? why isn't it your personality that's the problem in your case?
it doesn't matter if short guys have it a little easier building muscle. i've seen ripped guys and they're not all midgets. imagine being a tall gymrat and shitting on manlets. you're clearly in the privileged position. the crab bucket mentality on display. it's because you want to please women so badly.
<comment>
How the actual fuck am I privileged? The "Women only like tall guys" meme it's a fucking meme.

My body looks like the 7 but with the mass of 3.
<comment>
Of course, your arguments are full of data, how wrong would you be, right?
<comment>
literally looks right at the hook touches the tip and goes "this is definitely bait"
takes it anyway
Holy fuck, how are you this retarded. OP is very transparently a fatass tranny "merely pretending" to be retarded to start shit between manlets and skelleys.

... I never thought I'd be the idiot to get baited and get lectured... Things on r9k are worse than I thought...

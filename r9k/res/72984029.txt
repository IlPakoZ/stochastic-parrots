I'm sorry. It (mostly) wasn't your fault, dad. But seriously holy fuck watching me on the computer all day and thinking it was funny/I was some kind of tech wiz. That was unbelievably retarded
You sound like a privileged, ungrateful pussy who may have lacked a bit of discipline but fuck what a bitch lol
Damn you have a dad, and he cares about you? Nice. I'm 26 still a virgin, and my mom straight up told me she can't do anything for me and when she dies she's not leaving anything behind. My dad died years ago. I can't find a job. 
You have something be proud of yourself.
Your dad sacrificed you to the canaanite god called internet ( spider's web )
Apologize to your father for trauma dumping on him like a lil bitch
Boohoo your dad didn't have the foresight to predict western collapse and the incel crisis. What did he do? He sought to make sure the biggest problem in his upbringing was solved in yours and he accomplished it. He also loves you. There's not much more you can ask of a parent. 
Yes, he saw you on the computer 14 hours a day, but he also saw that your grades were fine, saw how much you liked it, and decided it probably wasn't that bad. 
Maybe if you don't commit suicide and manage to reproduce you can make it your goal to equip your son with the skills and resilience to navigate the future's social climate.
forgot to mention
kys OP you sexhaving normie retard. i'm 30 and have never kissed a girl. I will never experience pussy apart from my $5000 imported sex doll's silicone hole that i have to lubricate manually.
exactly. people forget the age of computers and internet addiction is still fairly recent. so children end up being raised by the internet instead of going to their parents. if you want things to be better, teach the younger generation how to not fuck up their lives with technology overload
Fpbp

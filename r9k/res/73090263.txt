Good day 
How are you doing today?
Any plans for today?
When was the last time you hurt yourself?
Why did you hurt yourself?
Is there anything bothering you right now?

hey there. i always think of her and it saves me from being anxious about a lot of things. my divorced parents are again fighting, this time one of them asked me to name a full sum of what they spend on me each month. how will i stomach knowing the expenses? with my self esteem issues? not really worried since she is visiting soon. i probably said this before but i cant stop worrying about her though. mental and physical health issues, all that. well. at least everything is going well with my relationship with her. she says im a yandere (i think she knows i cut myself over her a few times, and she knows I wanted to cut myself when i thought she did not want me) and looks like she is more than okay with that which is amazing. she sometimes jokes about me kinning Yuri from that game and i like and accept it. 
I wanted to cut myself a few times for the past days and i always told her about it. she always helps and yesterday made a condition that if i cut myself she wont visit. i have to be a good boy, or she will be upset. speaking of being a good boy, whimpering and purring to her in telegram voice messages brings me such a surge of joy and happiness and fulfillment that i just melt inside! and my aliexpress order arrived. bunch of stuff like Juuzou Suzuya cosplay and a metal leash, when i dress like Juuzou i will try to get a picture for you guys

how yyou guys doing today, anything up? 
been preparing for london, i wil eat at chick fill a or five guys for the first time when im there
usual melanchonic boredom today as well 
my divorced parents are again fighting, this time one of them asked me to name a full sum of what they spend on me each month
thats rough, mine are also divorced since i was 8, they didnt really fight tho they where just absent, so i have a familiar feel 
im glad to see that your happy in your relationship, dont really have a right to criticize but maybe you should try to be les depended on her. i dont think you should make her your life

Hello Juuzouanon, nice dubs 
I'm happy you've finally found someone irl who cares about you and with whom you can talk about your selfharm 
Hope your life continues to get better
That situation with your parents seems awful, I think that the best course of action is to not participate 
Your parents shouldn't be dragging you into this, you've got enough to be anxious about as it is
when i dress like Juuzou i will try to get a picture for you guys
yess definitely send us a pic whenever you can 
Hi sludge, I see you forgot your name again hah :D 
I'm doing fine, not much has happened since yesterday, I had lots of lectures today but they were online so I just joined the Teams call and went to sleep
<comment>
Hello Juuzouanon. It's good you are happy with your gf, I hope you can enjoy your time together, and that it eases your anxiety a bit. Still, I alao hope that you can find a way to ease your stresses on your own, as dependance on that level has potential to become debilitating. Still, best of health, Juuzouanon.
I wasn't even awar they had either of those restaurants in the United Kingdom. Shows how much I know as an American, heh.
I hope the rest of you are doing well. Here's a goofy ass picture of my dog, Ruger. How are the rest of you folk doing?

I'll probably read some posts on here and stay around a bit longer, some might discover these and say "hey go fuck yourself" but idk
you're always welcome here. stay awhile, lurk, post or vent about whatever comes to mind. maybe that'll help and if someone you know reads what you post, maybe they'll understand you a bit better. 
hey, k. hope you where able to withstand your urges.
helloooo, catbro! did you do your stretches today? ^^
hi, juuzouanon. 
this time one of them asked me to name a full sum of what they spend on me each month.
what an incredible spiteful thing to do. honestly, i don't think you should humor them with a response. what are they fighting about and why are they trying to get you involved? 
not really worried since she is visiting soon.
good. don't pay that shit any heed. not your fault they have buyers remorse. 
she always helps and yesterday made a condition that if i cut myself she wont visit.
happy to see that you can support each other. hope you can keep it up. 
when i dress like Juuzou i will try to get a picture for you guys
as always: please make it a spoiler. 
oi, sludge!
been preparing for london
nice! how long will you stay? is it just for the concert or is it a longer trip?
and of course: hello, everybody! hope you're having a wonderful day!

helloooo, catbro! 
Hiya :D 
did you do your stretches today? ^^
yes, they weren't very graceful but it's not very important, what matters is persistence and I'll try to do them every day 
How are you doing today yuanon?

i think it a fairly recent developement in europe in general. for a very long time it was only mcdonalds and burger king, followed by kfc. now the other chains are trying to get a hold as well, but they are mostly located in larger cities. 
Here's a goofy ass picture of my dog, Ruger.
what a cutie.

awesome. if you keep it up you'll get the hang of it and improve fairly quickly, but i hoped you didn't so i'd have an excuse to skip mine. well, i guess i'll have to do them now then. drat. 
How are you doing today yuanon?

five days, gonna do the usual tourist shit for a city trip 
hey catbro
I had lots of lectures today but they were online so I just joined the Teams call and went to sleep
did that a lot during covid, crazy how everyone just forgot about it
my bag is too small so ill have to wear my battlejacket on the plane, kinda embarrassing but i want to wear it to the concert 
do you guys also have waves of the urge to impulse buy?
i had it today, but i resisted the urge 
ive been stressed out lately because blackrock keeps pumping fluoride in the water, they once claimed it was benificial to dental health, but it has proven to cause illness and dissease, they do this to increase ''medicine'' sales 
bottled water is also not safe because of microplastics 
i dont need to tell you why sodas and other drinks are bad 
so basicaly is imposible to not ingest fluoride
blackrock also sued itself to fire tucker carlson because he spoke out about their control over the media

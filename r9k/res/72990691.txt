reading books for foids to psychologically sissify myself.
Am I based or cringe?
I am interested in these novels as well to gain insights into female psychology, though I am under no delusions that the characters are all gigachads, which I am not. Though I am over 6ft.
they're just smut. a kind of pornography. and yes, the men in romance novels average 6' 3" and are handsome according to the studies done on these books. top 10% IRL looks easily for the MEDIAN male interest in the book.
From what I've read they like evil but deep down good characters. Like they are extremely dominating and seemingly cruel, but on the inside they are actually good.
they like fried ice. there is no such thing as "evil but good". the characters they like are men who are brutal to other people but not to the self-insert female lead character.
yeh its prolly not possible irl

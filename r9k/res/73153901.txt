Like, for example, carried you in his arms, or over his shoulder, or given you a piggy back ride, etc?

Anon, fembots weight too much for the average man to carry.

I have carried many women like this, I have also dropped women like this, they do not like being dropped and hurt what they attack me
I guess picking random strangers up is a no no

I've never dropped one if they're too heavy you can just gently ease them down.

Don't remember when bridal style but over the shoulder with play fighting, piggy back rides I can name a few. A guy has also used me for weights in the gym once

Yes I gave one of my girlfriends a piggy back ride and I carried all of them in my arms at least once. I think I should do ballroom dancing classes so I can do this again.

Well if he's really strong he might be able to do it. Have you considered taking dance classes? That's a good way to position yourself to be carried.

That way and others, by men and women alike. I hate it, I'm 4'6" and people even relative strangers assume they can just take liberties with me and treat me like a child or something.

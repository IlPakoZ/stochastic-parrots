Like, for example, carried you in his arms, or over his shoulder, or given you a piggy back ride, etc?
Anon, fembots weight too much for the average man to carry.
I have carried many women like this, I have also dropped women like this, they do not like being dropped and hurt what they attack me
I guess picking random strangers up is a no no
Anon, fembots weight too much for the average man to carry.
I'm not sure that all of them are
I've never dropped one if they're too heavy you can just gently ease them down.
yeah 
Don't remember when bridal style but over the shoulder with play fighting, piggy back rides I can name a few. A guy has also used me for weights in the gym once
Do guys enjoy this activity?
Would you like to carry a girl?
yes especially my dad
im a teenager now but he still does it sometimes when his wife (not my mom) isnt there to chastise him for being childish
love you pops
My dad when I was still small.
Yes I gave one of my girlfriends a piggy back ride and I carried all of them in my arms at least once. I think I should do ballroom dancing classes so I can do this again.
no but I want a man to carry me like this so bad, I think I am too fat though
Well if he's really strong he might be able to do it. Have you considered taking dance classes? That's a good way to position yourself to be carried.
That way and others, by men and women alike. I hate it, I'm 4'6" and people even relative strangers assume they can just take liberties with me and treat me like a child or something.

Bros, do the feels ever stop?
can you post some examples of her art and the AI's?
I nuked the folder after realizing my mistake, anon. It just hurt too much to look at.
yeah I would probably just kill myself personally
Bros, do the feels ever stop?
nope, not unless you yourself are willing to change, which isn't as ill-conceived as others may have convinced you in the past. that kind of rare occurrence you had is something too unique for one person to dwell on. in all reality? was she in college like yourself during covid and the cough? a lot of girls fall out of their drawing phase as they get older, unless you think...?
she was just starting college. a year or two older than me. our relationship was centered around her messaging me first in the morning, so I'm pretty sure she's gone. I don't think it's fair to assume otherwise. change is hard, and I didn't realize trying this would rip off the bandaid.
well allow me to suggest some tobacco, alcohol, weed, and /mu/. i left for college in 2017 at 21 and my cat of 9 years disappeared. i'm 27 now and still like to believe he's out there just chillin somewhere, probably with a better family. there's so much you new kids don't know about that we older kids are just sitting around waiting to tell you about but you guys haven't come around just yet.
What a waste, beautiful things are meant ot be enjoyed.
and that's how someone died in vain instead of you glorifying their name. Coronavirus was caused intentionally by the chinese &amp; affiliates, top scientists etc. worldwide
they tried to recruit me as a physicist
yo op if u want some art, music, youtube vids, writing-look up Robert Soley on facebook-picture of a dog
it's the portal (it started openin up again
i might come back to it some day. for now I need the time to process these feels. you're right though. the Mona Lisa survived until now, but these AI imitations don't feel 100% like her.
come on now, if i don't publish the model anonymously I'll just be inviting a mob of tards to smear me instead
dank je wel doktor

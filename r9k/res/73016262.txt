Boy who wears girl clothes bf and girl who wears boy clothes gf
I am all for role reversal.
I would say "marry me" but it's more something like "drink blood from my neck like a vampire"
only thing missing is the dead bedroom and the girl cheating whenever she's ovulating (aka attracted to masculinity)
I raise
think muscle maids and crop tops
Nuh uh, she wouldn't cheat and we'd be fucking a lot

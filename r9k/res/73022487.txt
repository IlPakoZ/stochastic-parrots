I like pic related when it comes to traps, but the opposite with women I love big titted milky goddesses. Weird I know. I wish I could have a harem of both milk flowing tit cows as well as feminine small/A cup traps with small/medium sized dicks. Life truly is suffering.

How many of current LGBT teens do you believe that are actually just pretending it to be because in first world countries is just the cool thing now?
How does this affect actual gay teens?
Do you think homosexuality is a learned trait, and that more exposure to homosexuality actually affects kids during their development?
Or do you think there's a lot more lgbt people than before simply because they can speak up now?

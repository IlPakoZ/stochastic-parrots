After a few weeks on tinder I only got 3 matches out of hundreds of swipes, none of which replied. Is this OLD in a nutshell for average dudes?

3 matches
normie, please leave and never come back.

That is normal , women are getting hit by 100s of guys a day and and messaged and sent dick pics 
The balance is tilted in their inbox

unless you're rural, there's no good reason to use apps if you're hetero. Every space is a straight space by default, even the most known gay bar in any large city, so you're better off trying to meet people irl/organically
you have much better odds irl, because so many men stay home with video games and porn. there's also fewer fatties at places that don't have their own parking lots and involve being upright. compared to apps, the gender ratios are much more favorable almost everywhere.
if you think you're too autistic for that, at least find a neurodivergent meetup group or something to grind your social skills a bit. you won't be able to chat on apps without causing the ick with your syntax

The only reason to be on Tinder as a man looking for women is if you're so good-looking that one well-selected picture will make them think "Yeah sure I'd fuck him".

every place I go irl is a sausagefest, except for the odd time when there's a girl's night out and they're all woooooooo~ and generally acting like utter cunts

imagine how many vain guys in your area are buying tinder subscriptions to jump to the top of the queueueue
you're never getting looked at
<comment>
Literally the complete opposite. Dating apps are useless in rural areas.
<comment>
how far are rural people willing to travel for a date?
dating apps can get up to 100miles on basic radius
hinge is a more targeted app, but it lets you choose your location anywhere you want (and filter by race)
<comment>
Maybe 30 miles maximum for dating. Anything above that is a pure hookup. The problem is, even if you're good-looking, why would a woman drive 45 minutes to meet up halfway with someone, when they can meet a guy in the city who's 5 minutes away?
Guys in rural areas are fucked.

initially guys would have to put more of the travel effort in
then there is a subsection of women who will be the ones who end up doing more of the travelling in order to maintain the relationship once they are invested

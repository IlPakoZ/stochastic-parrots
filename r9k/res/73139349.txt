No but shitting your pants for tax credit is

If you have experience with animation then it can be. Whatever talent you have could be put to use with that. It'd help if you already knew some NSFW 3d animators too.

You have to have some niche because the best of the best have already done it. Fugtrup makes 3k a month and that's just because he was one of the few who excelled in 3D from the start.

There's little to no anime pov, just shitty 3d trash

grass and trees have always been pointless
this is a cool ally. i like when buildings are vertically developed like this. it would look cooler with moar trees and nature though
makes me think it'll be hot and uncomfortable. I hate that feeling of heat radiating off the ground and buildings with no cool shade from trees anywhere. hellish desu.
fuck off americunt. i'd take this hot and smelly alleyway over your wasteful lawns and trees any day.
Nah anon this is the perfect street. Road in the middle then trees then sidewalk. There is no way to improve this.

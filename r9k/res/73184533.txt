sit in a cafe alone
enjoying my coffee in peace
chad and his gf sit next to me
she is loudly giggling at everything he says
cant drink my coffee in peace anymore
They couldve sat anywhere else, the cafe is basically empty. God I hate normies.
Just take your coffee to go then, dumbass.
Get up and sit at a different scene. Move the chair loudly and make a scene out of it.
Personally i would be happy for them and hope for the best, seeing happy couples make me feel a tiny bit better
personally, id pour the coffee over them and run away
The cafe I'm in doesnt have that option, besides I prefer to chill in a cafe for an hour anyway.
Did this, the chad gave me a confused glance but its much more peaceful now.
I sympathise. Though shit like this is why I think going outside is very over-rated.
I have sat in a small park with a coffee, but also have to deal with noisy children and seeing normies/couples. Fuck, I miss the lockdown.

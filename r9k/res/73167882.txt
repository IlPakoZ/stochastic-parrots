getting some proper clothes, hygiene and mustering up the courage to speak to a girl would end inceldom for 90% of this board
what about the 10%?
what if your're 5,4 or stupid ugly?
i literally have the body of a woman, i doubt it
fuck that. also most of them are social retards who just happen to get a lot of attention.
All it takes. Ive been approached by girls on a few occasions. I wouldnt say Im handsome or ugly, maybe some people could like my look? But I think Im weirding them out either way once they get to talk to me for a few weeks.
Remember r/9k, only bee yourself when "yourself" is within the current norm
Yeah, I guess... but I'm 32 now and never talked to a girl like that before so I don't really think it's happening any time soon
Not really. There's been a gradual demographic shift here, and the hikkimori NEETs with paralyzing anxiety and shyness are now a minority. They're still here, but they are outnumbered by a combination of high achieving IT-anons who discovered that getting a high-paying job no longer helps you get a gf and /fit/ refugees who refuse to believe that you can still be forced by your low overall social status to date only fat girls even if you are in really good shape yourself.
Add "find a cure for autism" and I agree with you.
This without fixing my shit part. I've come to realize I hate women and any actual thought experiment involving willingly sharing my agency with them makes me uncomfortable.
Just say "if you are not tall good looking Chad, muscles won't help"
I'm not white, so no. It wouldn't
You do know that everybody is already doing the selfimprovement shit naturally, right? Look at that black pilled loser DBDR on youtube. You must understand that for some guys it was just over since they were born.
True, the doomsaying to contrary isn't even the 10% who are truly fucked it's just various flavors of sadists being deliberately disingenuous

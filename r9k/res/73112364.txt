Does anyone else sleep an excessive amount because they have to? I hear about people funtioning daily on 4 hours of sleep and that sounds truly nightmarish. Sleep cycles are 90 minutes long so its quite easy to measure out capability and effect for me. Anything less than a solid 9 hours is a guaranteed terrible migraine and horrible day where I refuse to function and count the hours until I can try to make up for what was taken from me. I live on cheat mode being a neet but small things like deliveries, poor eating habits or my family uncaringly causing a ruckus can steal this bliss from me. I fear working and sudden schedule changes because it throws my entire rhythm off balance and causes a great deal of suffering.

I probably sleep to much (10-12 hours)
Does anyone have a non-circadian sleep cycle?

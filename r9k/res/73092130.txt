Do women, including fat ones, only like fit men?
They like money anon. Even if you are old ugly fuck, you will get a girlfriend if you have enough money.
they dont care about fitness or money. they only care about genetics, objectively speaking, for tall height and handsome face. simple as that.
they like value. men that take care of themselves physically outwardly signal a tendency toward life habits that entail success, and therefore higher value. generally speaking a woman is only as valuable as her man.
that's not a gf, that's a prostitute. a gf is a woman who gets with you when you're still a financial gamble/risk. once you're established/have career/have money/have education, you're locked out of genuine love based relationships.
they don't care about value either op, btw. these are all cope things. they care about immutable, permanently fixed characteristics that you can't work on. height and face genetics. they do not care about the rest for genuine love, only for cold interest and calculated association like passionless relationships.
Most like tall, but not freakishly so, thin guys
For most, yes, you need to be fit or skinny.
But if you are tall, you can get away with being chubby or skinny-fat.
no. you know how theres a dark triad? theres a light triad too:
funny, hot, rich. the more you are of one, the less you need of the other 2
Yes that whole fat acceptance movement was so fat women wouldn't feel bad about banging chads.

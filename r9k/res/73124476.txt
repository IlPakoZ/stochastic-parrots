Why are passable trans women either lesbians or have an OF?

If you saw them in person you wouldn't think the same. And I say this as a consumer of trans porn. But in person just seeing the hands, feet or back would make you sick.

A lot of those types of trans people are trans for fetishistic reasons. This gives them a much higher rate when it comes to how likely one is to produce porn and such. I know so many trans people IRL who only date other trans people, and all have some kind of obsession with the fact that they have a dick. I don't know any who actually want to date women with a vagina. The dick is actually considered important, so I must conclude that some part of it is a fetish. Ironically they will also complain about how they hate "chasers", which are men who want a trans GF specifically, but they do the same thing, so.

I Spoke to a tranny about the OF thing, they said that sex work is a place of comfort and acceptance for them, basically its easier to deal with being a whore in your own little sex bubble than trying to get a job that requires you to deal with normal people who will see you as a freak.

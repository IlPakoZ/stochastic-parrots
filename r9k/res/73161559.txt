You will go outside
You will buy meat from the butchers
And you will be happy

I looked it up. Only South African English uses the word "butchery" as a single word for a butcher's shop. Is it possible that this is the more evolved form of English?
<comment>
nope butchery is the noun form of the action butchering
south Africa is still retarded

German has "Metzgerei."
Spanish has "Carnisseria."
South African English has "butchery."
English has "butcher's shop."
Two words. Clunky. Stop being shameful.

I am an American landowner, and I have the power to shape the world. You are an insignificant serf living under the power of a lord. You can't use capitalization or apostrophes correctly. I have phenomenal cosmic power over the minds and souls of the masses. You don't even have control of your own penis.

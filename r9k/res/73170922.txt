I met this pretty girl a little under a year ago and we hit it off pretty good. I don't really know what she sees in me but I liked her and she liked me. 
Recently I've been losing interest in her. I don't know why. I know that, if I left her, I'd be really lonely. At the same time, I feel like I can't be a good boyfriend by staying with her. I'm not sure what to do. I feel terrible.
did u meet her irl? sometimes you just like the idea of a person
Yeah. She lives about 30 minutes away so visits are somewhat sparse but even over our distance chats I struggle to find interest.
people dont feel the same forever. you cant force yourself to feel something thats not there.

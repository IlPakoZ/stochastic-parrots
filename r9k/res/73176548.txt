rate my cinema backlog
depends on your age. pretty basic but not bad for a starter pack. looks like what a 16 yo hipster in 2009 would have saved, but even so it's severly lacking
pretty good but not amazing films. like, competent crowd pleasers.
NPC tier selection.
well, it's bad. idk what else to say here
Movies are a complete waste of time. Play video game like normal people.
Mishima movie alone elevates it above npc tier.
It's similar to mine, which people have said was basic and they told me I was someone that was "easily surprised or entertained" 
Well yeah, since the movies of the past 13 years have mostly sucked balls
There's a disturbing lack of Steven Seagal movies

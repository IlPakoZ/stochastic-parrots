There is no point to living after 30 as a single male. Everything life has to offer after this point is normie shit, like starting a family and watching your kids grow up. There is literally NOTHING to look forward to after around 30 or so.
body becomes less resillient
impossible to make new friends, existing friends start families and fade away
video games and TV stop being fun
loneliness only gets worse with time
dating prospects never improve
society withdraws from you entirely and leaves you in the dust
The only cope you have left is career advancement and retirement (if you have one), but good luck climbing through the ranks at a company as an asocial autist, and by the time you retire you'd be so withered and over it all that it wouldn't even be enjoyable. And that's if you even live long enough to retire.
The future fucking terrifies me. I don't want to get old.

everyday is one day closer to death
he fears getting older
On the contrary, each passing a day is a day closer to salvation. Lets face it, our twenties and teens were shit too, so who cares?

idk man, i love playing video games all the time and you can't do that when you have a gf. i still get laid but just don't settle. once i get bored of video games i'll get a wife. i don't think that will ever happen my life is way too comfy as it is.
<comment>
after a while, video games just stop being fun. its quite fucking sad
are there any positives?
<comment>
What if you couldn't get laid
<comment>
are there any positives?
Yes, you have to find them on your own. You got people who are disabled and still find happiness.
<comment>
i already had that phase, but once i started getting a stable comfy situation and making peace with death, i started loving them again
then i'd be pissed but not that much, you can still jerk off. sometimes i can go a month at most without laid and just fap
<comment>
then i'd be pissed
Exactly, I'm 30 and everything feels like a cope

Yeah but at the same time you also realize that 20 year olds happiness comes from a total lie. Well not everyone, but there's young guys out there that are motivated by that future (and being successful in it) not realizing that the best years of their lives are right then and there (assuming they're normie+, not my case). Ofcourse at 30+ being successful is the most desirable option, but you realize that you're getting older and that the world is not as magical a place as you thought. I mean, theres billionaires who have killed themselves in their 70s. In short, it seems the upside is limited (though not nonexistent) but the downside is massive.....

I hope my boyfriend feels this way so he never leaves me.

You start making art with all of your alone time and better finances, which will provide you more longterm satisfaction than any temporary dopamine hits from beating video games or getting laid every once in a while
<comment>
you can get laid too, it's not that hard, have normal standards and don't be retarded, you don't have to be some rich superhuman to just get laid lol

I cant really argue with you on this one. 
I'm gay so having a family was never in the cards for me in the first place. Never had much of a sex life either. 
I'm 32 in a week or two so all of that is essentially over. At least all the parts of it that matters. Sure I can go hike a mountain or start with some adrenaline junkie hobby like parachuting or some other temporary cope, but all in all. It's just over. 
Like you said. All my friends have disappeared into family life or careers. I see my best friends maybe 3-4 times a year. 
I realised this back when I was 15, back when I realised I would never walk the traditional straight, get degree, get wife, have kids, buy house, route. I realised I had about 10-15 years. I spent those years doing mostly whatever I wanted to do and for a few years I was actually enjoying myself. Maybe I delusionally thought I could live that life forever and that the fun would never stop. But there's a limit to hedonism and you hit the wall of diminshing returns. Nothing feels good anymore, nothing is exciting. 
I'm getting old and ugly and nobody wants you. Nobody ever did. It's hard to care about anything when nobody cares about you. 
The sooner I bite a bullet the better.

jacking off gets old after a while. Eventually you'll realize that you'll never get the real thing, and stop getting excited and no longer feel the urge to jack off because it's all so shallow and hopeless. It stops being fun, and becomes more of a chore
how exactly is 20s happiness a lie? And even if it is, how is it a bad thing? At least they're happy.

No, you need to see happy people to remind you that the r9k competition to be the saddest isn't reflected in reality.

No so much. In your late 30s and early 40s the guys making entertainment company decisions are about your age so they start doing pop culture in response to the pop culture you grew up with, which is kind of interesting. The ability to make cheaper video games so indie games like the ones you enjoyed can happen. Piracy of the old stuff becomes easier. Your libido as a man goes down so you don't miss sex as much. 
Once you realize nothing much matters in the grand scheme the pressure comes off. No wife? No kids? No desires? Great, there's literally nothing they can hang over you anymore. What are they going to do, fire me? Fuck this job I'm not buying shit anyway. Girlfriend left? Great, she was a fat shrew and was starting to look like an old lady. Your friends don't have a life and you didn't really want to see a bunch of tweens poorly playing songs you've never heard of anyway.
And that's what you have to look forward to: enlightenment. You can be you without reservation. You share your knowledge with whoever. Or not. Whatever. It's all gonna be different again in five years anyway.

The fact that people are more than willing to hurt each other for personal gain is more than enough of a reason for me to just end it. I hate people. 
Pic not related, I just don't feel like going through my folders anymore

that makes no sense, i would understand wanting to end them but why yourself?

I don't want to hurt people just because I've been hurt by people. I just want the pain to stop. I Just want people to stop hurting each other. Every day I see innocent people getting robbed, killed, and fucked by their governments. I can't handle seeing this anymore

I'm sorry what? You saying "I'm the father" even though we haven't fucked since 2013?

so the obvious solution is eliminating the robbers, killers, and fuckers
or do you think there's some magical disney solution that will make everything perfect? where everybody wins and the world becomes paradise?
if you wanna ragequit life go ahead, but don't try to pretend you care about stopping the evils of this world, you little bitch

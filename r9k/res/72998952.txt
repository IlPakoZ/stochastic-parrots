Is there any hope for a 30yo man with a hairline like this?
(not me in the pic obv)

Mine is worse, balding straight in the middle.
There is hope, there are hair growing solutions, cheap hair transplants in Turkey, or embracing and going full bald with a leather jacket and a well-groomed beard.

What age are you though? I'd say for 30 that's a pretty bad hairline and it looks like the dude in OP pic has a rapidly thinning horseshoe shape on the top of his head. I reckon he'll be full horseshoe before 35.

35, going straight into number 6, face-first.

What stage were you at 30?

26 and I'm between 5 and 6. It's so fucking over lmao

Hmm... I'd say... 4? Maybe, not sure. Now I am between 5 and 6.
<comment>
Yep. That's pretty fucking beyond over.

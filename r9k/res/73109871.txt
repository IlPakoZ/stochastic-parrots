Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it to keep looking for love. It seems like everyone just wants to hook up and move on, and no one is interested in a real relationship anymore. But I can't help feeling like there has to be something more out there. Something real and meaningful. Something that will make all this loneliness worth it in the end

Sex has become really inflated now days. It is everywhere, in media, in daily life, it is unavoidable. I doubt you will find a romantic relationship but good luck man

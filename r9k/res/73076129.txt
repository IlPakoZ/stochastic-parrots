Im scared guys I gotta make a call in a few hours to get a job. Basically someone referred me for this job so I have a feeling its a 90% chance I get hired. How do you build yourself up to make calls?? Im over thinking it
I hate making phone calls but for me the hardest part is the start of the call. Once you force yourself to just go "fuck it" and make the call, your mind should help you get through the whole process. I've started getting better at making phone calls this way, even if I stutter on my words once in a while. It's one of those things that when you do it often it gets really easy.

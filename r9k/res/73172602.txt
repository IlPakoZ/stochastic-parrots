war begins
everyone hyping the shit out of it
1.5 years later
no Su-57 vs F-35
no B-2s or B-52s flattening entire cities
no fuel air bombs blasting entire towns away
just unexperienced infantry popping shots at one another like in a paintball match
barely a war
Biggest disappointment since the cuban missle crisis

What did you expect in a war where third world country attacks its neighbour?
<comment>
Anyone who deals with Russia gets used to disappointment. They aren't even as strong as they were 40 years ago and we beat them then without a single B-52.

we
I don't remember a single conflict 40 years ago with a side that had B52. Or any big wars, apartfrom some shit in mudslime countries.

Notice how I said without a single B52, my esl friend.

Well it is like saying"without using space lasers" - it only adds confusion as there were no wars where opposition even possessed such a thing.
<comment>
why aren't wars like my videogames 
Mitts spent 20 years taking tax-paid vacations in Afghanistan, at least Ukraine has some action going on
<comment>
If anon said
no space lasers
There wouldn't have been confusion.

They want to avoid a WW3, not speedrun their way into one.

Perhaps a war is what world needs. At least it would either cure or kill countries infested with lgbt, rapefugee/nigger worshippers.

B52 is a meme anyway, Ruskie gave Nam some SAM and they got shot down like shit

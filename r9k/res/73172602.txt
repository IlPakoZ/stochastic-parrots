Biggest disappointment since the cuban missle crisis
What did you expect in a war where third world country attacks its neighbour?
Anyone who deals with Russia gets used to disappointment. They aren't even as strong as they were 40 years ago and we beat them then without a single B-52.
I don't remember a single conflict 40 years ago with a side that had B52. Or any big wars, apartfrom some shit in mudslime countries.
Notice how I said without a single B52, my esl friend.
Well it is like saying"without using space lasers" - it only adds confusion as there were no wars where opposition even possessed such a thing.
Mitts spent 20 years taking tax-paid vacations in Afghanistan, at least Ukraine has some action going on
If anon said
There wouldn't have been confusion.
They want to avoid a WW3, not speedrun their way into one.
Perhaps a war is what world needs. At least it would either cure or kill countries infested with lgbt, rapefugee/nigger worshippers.
B52 is a meme anyway, Ruskie gave Nam some SAM and they got shot down like shit

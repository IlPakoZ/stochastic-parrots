Pleasure is the deciding factor between right and wrong.
<comment>
Sure if you are reductionist with your definitions of pleasure, deciding, right, and wrong. Why make this thread though?
<comment>
The problem is that you'll eventually fall into the pleasire|pain axium and constantly damage your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well being in order to seek greater highs that fizzle out quicker and quicker. What happens when the short term pleasures stop hitting the same way? Also using "pleasure" as basis for morality is laughable because you're reaching a level of arbitrariness that is even more arbitrary than even some moral relativists, because it is a system of judgement devoid of any and all principles.

Might is the deciding factor in what is right and wrong.
Those with force and enforce whatever moral standards they wish until displaced by those more powerful.

To add to this, what happens when your pleasures change? What happens when you're no longer turned on by the same things or the foods you eat no longer bring the same satisfaction they used to? Also your own pleasures differ from that of other peoples. Is it okay for used up roasties to bang as many men as they want and cheat on their boyfriends simply because they feel that way at the moment? Also, if all you're concerned about is personal hedonism, where does a basis of "right and wrong" even stem from? Why even care about what constitutes as moral if your method of orienting yourself is devoid of these questions to begin with?

So is "might makes right" a method that you begrudgingly accept even if the current institution is enforcing something that greatly displeases you, or is this something you only cater to as an end in itself, wanting a system with this type of mindset to begin with?

The problem is that force in itself is not always optimal for maintaining power. The ability to build and keep relationships is a much more useful skill set in maintaining a monopoly on institutions that have a large sphere of influence on many peoples. If the only thing that you are capable of using force, then no matter how big or strong you are it won't matter when those who are unhappy with your rule team up against you and subsequently oust you from a position of power, either by assassination, coup, or political scandal. You cannot create a lasting institution with might alone.

I pay my taxes don't I.
It just the way the world actually is. I didn't ask for this. I didn't consent to it. But I either accept it or die.
The in-between is shit like hiding and prison.
<comment>
So might makes right is a fatalistic mindset you use then, not a constructive one. You have no intentions to change any existing power structures nor any plan to get out of them. You use this to cope with being trapped. 
I pay my taxes don't I.
Idk why someone in 2023 would pay taxes. Only cucks pay taxes. You are exchanging goods for no service. You are being robbed and you are too much of a pussy to do anything about it.

Are you actually retarded?
Those with force enforce whatever moral standards they wish until displaced by those more powerful
But what if someone gathers more force and displaces the one in power to then enforce their own moral standards?
You literally just gave a more complicated regurgitation of what I just said.

Kill yourself for the glorious revolution
You too live in society dumbass.
I don't see you alla snackbaring yourself and clearly you are on the grid so you ain't hiding trying to be a non-participant in a system you don't agree with.
So blow it out your ass. You don't actually believe any of the bullshit you just ploped down.

No, force is not the same as coercion or compromise or bribery. You cannot use force as an effective method to maintain power in every instance. If I convince you of something I am not banging on your door or threatening to stab you or sending an army on your doorstep, nor are you even obligated to listen to someone who successfully convinces you of something. Using force as a method of maintaining power does not last and is why African warlords cannot maintain or even start successful nations.

Nowhere in my post did I ever mention killing someone or starting a violent revolt, you are thinking via a one track mind where force is the only thing on it. Do you know why I don't pay taxes? Because it's morally wrong. I refuse to pay taxes because I will not devote myself to demonic entities and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Ironically enough, through deriving your only system of morality externally through structures such as "might makes right" and nothing beyond that causes you to fall sway under systems that are morally wrong to begin with. You participate in a beast system because you play by its rules and its standards, not the rules and standards that are actually true.

Your exact words
team up against you and subsequently oust you from a position of power, either by assassination, coup
Again, are you actually retarded?
I think you might be.

Moids be like
no moid says its womens fault the system also fucks them you retarded bitch, they whine about suicide statistics and how everyone expects them to be a chad or something schizo like that and thats it, your perception of reality is based on this fucked place and it doesnt translate into reality as nothing here does
The entire system is built to preserve and cater to women. If all men globally just agreed to put women back in the cages, we'd be colonozing the far reaches of the Milky Way by now. Just think of how many sacrifices were made to keep the facade that women are just as good, how much production is wasted on keeping women in the workforce, how much education is wssted on women, how many industries concentrate on producing worthless trinkets that only appeak to women, how much of our culture and entertainment is focused on portraying women as important and necessary members of society, how many laws favor women and excuse their failings. We had always been living in a global Matriarchy. Humanity is centered around femniggers.
"oppressed" foids be like
I do not believe that women created the patriarchy. I do however find it perplexing how feminists won't admit that high status men treat low status women better than they treat low status men.
even accepting the feminist assertion that society is patriarchal, you should understand that not every man is a patriarch, just as not every jew is a billionaire.
class inequality and social hierarchy exist in humans because women use it to choose among men.
the class difference between rich Chad with more buffalo steaks than poor incel with only gathered berries existed far before any societal organization.
human inequality exists because women need it to exist.
fellas, we're under attack today
the cc sluts raiding and out of control

Fun fact. You can buy a super powerful magnet off amazon, attach a rope to it, and go fishing in city rivers for free guns. Police officers haaaaate it! Every time I bring them a new gun they're like "not again!" Now they have to open all the cold case files again.

i'd have to check if we had finders keepers laws. if it was illegal to keep it, i'd hand it in to the police.
you can't just go nbk, you just can't!

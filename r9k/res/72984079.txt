eunwoos face is tooooooo small and hes also boring. jinyoung is the whole package; good looking, funny, evil, nice as pie, mean as hell, kinky, father material, loves kids just a 10/10 personality all round, thicc with a big cock, can speak various languages, talented at a ton of things etc etc, basically holds the entire group together and takes care of everyone like a parent but can also be an asshole in a hot way when he wants to. he is perfection.

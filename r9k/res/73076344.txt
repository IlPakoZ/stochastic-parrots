or not. I had an extremely toxic and bad relationship with my mother, so i dont know if my instincts are just fucked up bc of it, or i was right. but many times after any sexual contact with a woman, i get this schizo feeling of deep mistrust, like as if women are the keepers of the matrix and they want to put my mind in chains.
It seems like women have a way of truly fucking up peoples life too, if they ever feel like it. When i meet men who are too effeminate i instantly dont trust them bc i assume them to be as treacherous as women. 
So, is it based to be gay, realizing this? The fear, though, is that making a relationship sexual can make it turn sour, so by being gay i could ruin relationships with men that if it never turned sexual id still have; and having relationships with men, whether i get with women or not, is important to keeping my sanity. But is there a way to be cool with the bros of this world, AND be gay? or to stay capable of having male friendships do i have to also avoid letting myself be sexually intimate with men?

How rich are your parents?
<comment>
dad died when i was 7, and my mother had to support 4 kids
goes without saying that we were quite poor

My single mom makes 70k a year so I guess lower middle class

Upper middle class I guess due to getting lucky on investments? They're not the nice and fun kind of rich parents either since they're working rich aka narcissistic yuppie fucks. On one hand you have cheap housing (cut rate rent) and free food/internet from living with them. On the other hand, you (the children) are not a real person in their eyes, just some investment vehicle they can use to gain bragging rites in front of their fellow yuppies and family members with. If you falter don't expect any support, not even a minimal "aww that sucks" kind of sympathy. Well at least that's my experience. My golden child younger brother has a different take...

I should also mention it's not like I'm some useless neet dropout either. I'm the kid that did everything right and mostly on time, and still got fucked over. All those years of trying to please them couldn't even get me a single bit of sympathy. I'm just using them to have a comfortable life until they drop, then cutting off the rest of our shithead relatives (who they also cut off for being leeches lmfao). It's all "just business", as they taught me very well.

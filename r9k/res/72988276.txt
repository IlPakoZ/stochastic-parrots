I only watched nuWonka but jumping into some freak machine sounds more schizo than childish.
Dahl only disliked Jews because they were his rivals in the art of shekel grubbing.
You wouldn't want to play with a teleporter/shrink-ray as a kid?

Enjoy getting gang banged by ants.
Bruh my family and friends would carry me around in their pockets, I'd be fine.

masturbate to a plethora of weird gay shit for years
never had a single wet dream that doesn't involve transforming a woman into a living twinkie
There's no such thing as being born attracted to the same sex, something corrupted your mind around puberty and it's your job to fix it.

I agree that nobody is born a fag but I also think that there's no way to fix it except being mercifully thrown off of a rooftop

this is the part where the no fap bullshit works. it wont make your T higher, cum doesnt have magic properties, but going away from a lot of these manufactored fetishes will restore you back to the default. you cant get rid of ALL fetishes, but certaintly the ones from the sexual bordem you had with vanilla shit, that made you shift more and more onto the depravity of /d/ or whereever the fuck you are

But my discord boyfriend calls me cute and I want to put his dick up my butt

How does that prove anything?
I'm straight, which means you can't be gay
Huh???

Gay people always start like this, get into weird porn and eventually think their fetishes are part of them. People who were abused also end up using porn and fixating their beliefs.

How were all those greeks gay then before porn was invented.

Demoralization psyop post. 
Try something you've never done before that's reasonable and safe, maybe take a walk around your space or outside around the block. Have some fun.

Isn't this something rare that people decided to make a big deal of?

How did it exist at all if you need to watch porn to "turn" gay?

I didn't say porn is the only cause.

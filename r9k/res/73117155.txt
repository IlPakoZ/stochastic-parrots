All internet politics is just normies hating autists.
incels ( ugly autists ) vs others 
trannies ( gay autists ) vs others
chuds (angry autists ) vs others 
Autism unity when

as soon as I find a good autistic wife to fight for

That would mean the majority of autists would have to admit their defect, but they won't. Way too many are hell-bent on trying to be normal, that's the whole misery behind the chud thing. If they accepted who they are and why they're disliked they wouldn't be so angry in the first place. Furries, oddly enough, pretty much nailed it as far as communities go. They know damn well how autistic everyone is and they let people be themselves, they extend support, they create a community away from normies where they can all chill and be who they are.
If there was a spectrum of autism acceptance of autism, on the negative end there would just be a chud face boy glowering and on the opposite positive end there would be a blue dog fursuit head. I may make that image if I some time later.

Furgods can't stop winning

couldn't have said it better. Furries know how retarded they are and take it in stride. Every single racist chud or incel would give up on their entire worldview if a cute girl from the race they hate the most gave them attention. They crave normalcy, whereas furries rejected it, the crazy motherfuckers.

You are going to lose this war. Neurotypicals are chads and women. That is already a majority. And they also have at least half of sub8's on their side because they want to lie to themselves they are inside the circle and not outside.

Is this a common thing for autists to be into muscular anime women like in OPs pic? Because they're my type too

Autism is derived from the word "auto", meaning self. If it doesn't pertain to my niche interest then I don't give a shit. That's why there's always so much shit flinging, disagreement, and infighting in geek communities. Kirk vs Picard, Sony vs Nintendo, Marvel vs DC, and the above all else, Furries vs Every other autistic.
You're right; the furries managed to thread the needle, untie the Gordian knot. You don't have endless Wolf fursona vs Fox fursona arguments or debates as to if pokemon fursonas count. Never some mass excommunication of scalies, rats, or other more niche fursonas. Every furry autist expresses their own unique fursona design/colors/fetishes and is included. They even somehow managed to be pretty lockstep in gatekeeping the subculture from the actual animal fuckers. They're even united when they're doing the necessary exclusion of specific groups.
Accepting and celebrating differences is the fundamental difference between the furries and all other autistic groups. If it weren't for Fursona self insert culture there would probably be the same autistic infighting. With fursonas in the mix an attack on rat Anthros or scalies comes of as a borderline racist personal attack rather than a difference of opinion/preference.
It's fascinating, yet they're hated by every other autistic community.

VVe NEED an autistic ethnostate
<comment>
Of course I'm defective. How the fuck is my defect worse than literally drug addiction though. Drugscum fucks scores of women, gets into relationships, hurts bitches, and they keep coming to him. Autie can't get play. Autie hurts no one, causes no overdoses, does not lead to violent criminal behavior. Drugscum does literally all the sociopathic things and ends up with twelve kids he doesn't want.

Because drugscum talks to women
<comment>
faggot I talk to women. A lot. Almost exclusively.
The only thing drugscum is doing differently is harming himself and others.
<comment>
I'm just angry and anti social
I'm not diagnosed autistic and don't think I am. I really have no side to be on but my own.

Mentally ill people attract other mentally ill people, anon. The only difference is that druggie bpd women are common, and aspie women are more rare.

trannies are just gay autists

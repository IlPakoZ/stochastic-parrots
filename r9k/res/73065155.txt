Whats it like being a waging in US
being a wagie is shit but i like my coworkers :')
I bet they are just as dead inside like you .
maybe? im young and they're all young too so, idk.
Wageslaving is hell, especially if you are autistic. You can never get anything other than lowest form of wageslaving (fast food, cleaning etc.) and all your coworkers will treat you like shit, so I got an official diagnosis and now I will just continue leeching off the welfare system until I die.
I am thankful every day that I am not in burgerland and that as a result of that, I can stay on NEETbux for 17 years (not that it has been easy, mind you). I wish for UBI for all, so we can all be liberated from this wage-slave tyranny that gets worse every year, thanks to permanent inflation over the past fifty years. Though it seems obvious that burgerland will be the last ones to get it.
the crushing feeling that knowing in the few interactions of your co-workers is the thought "get this fucking zero away from me now."
I wish I had a gun sometimes
I wish I could just paint the walls of my room red
I work at walmart over night in canada.
It's kinda comfy. The entire crew is basically white people, but every other crew in the store (morning, evening) is all pajeets, as are the managers.

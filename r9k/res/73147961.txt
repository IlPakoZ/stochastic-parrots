be me
found an old classmate i was friend with on social
message him
it's the weekend so it's probably out drinking
i go to sleep
when i wake up i see he posted but still didn't read my message
He just didn't see it right? Maybe i forgot some details and he mad at me for something i did years ago. I maybe have 0 bitches but i would like to catch up and maybe start a friend circle again, right now i basically have 0 friends, idk tho

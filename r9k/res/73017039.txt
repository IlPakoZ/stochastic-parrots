Man those incels sure are a menace. What a bunch of pathetic losers. Height? Face? What? How about confidence, just being a fucking human being and treating women like people for once.

Well I had laser hair removal yesterday and now have second degree burns all over my face. The weather here is shit rn its a snow storm. I hope everyone is having a better day than me.
<comment>
I didnt even read the subject just ignore me im having such a bad day
<comment>
My girlfriend cheated on my with a black guy Im afraid I might become racist, what should I do?
<comment>
I went outside for a walk today, no big deal, went down to the pub and had a pint, a chat with a few of the lads and came home to my girlfriend. Just sitting on the sofa, cuddling, watching a bit of shit telly before bed.
<comment>
I am a guy and am considering having this...should I reconsider? I just hate shaving and can't grow a full beard anyway, just neck hair + mustache.
<comment>
So I got it done on my chin and upper lip. Upper lip was fine with no issues. Im not sure if the tech had it on a too high of setting but I met with the doc today and she said second degree burns are very rare but happens (to me, of course). Over all, it wasnt bad. Depending on hair type and severity you may need 6-8 treatments. Be aware its fucking expensive too.
<comment>
Oh shit that is awful I really hope it heals soon. How much was it in total? I am afraid of the price desu
<comment>
Thank you. I was not happy when I woke up to this, its not like make up can make it look any better so Im walking around goofy with bandaids on my face. For just the consultation it cost me $150, and one session of laser was $375 for my upper lip and chin.

i fucking hate incels so much its unreal. theyre clearly the most retarded subhuman group on this sub because theyll bump not one, but two of the exact same threads just so they can seethe about some twitter screenshot from 5 years ago. and do they ever have anything new to say? no, of course not. they say the exact same thing they say when they shit up every other thread on /r9k/. theyre like fucking bots, but at least bots can be trained over time to be less retarded. sincerely, kys losers. no one likes you or sympathizes with you. you arent victims, youre parasites.

Goddamn that is a lot. Idk if it's worth it...I don't need it THAT badly. Do you have PCOS btw?
<comment>
Maybe try waxing? There is also a prescription cream that makes hair really fine and basically nonexistent. I think just a visit to your primary dr they could write you a script. 
Do you have PCOS btw?
Nope, just really bad unfortunate genes that make me grow facial hair. Makes me want to cry every time I look at my face.
<comment>
I'm arranging a cook out and I need someone for grill duty
<comment>
Yes that is a good idea, I will look into it. I've heard of that cream, I think it's called Nair or something? Well I'm glad you don't have that condition anyway, I've heard ONE of the symptoms is growing facial hair. That makes me sad to read, I hope you can love yourself and your own face one day.

Dry rub or wet seasoning?
<comment>
Nair is something you can find otc at any drug store. I have never used it myself so I cant vouch whether it works well or not. I think they make a certain kind just for guys. So read the labels and look into it. Thank you anon, I appreciate that. I hope I can get there too. 
Robert Hoge
Ugh his story makes me sad but I'm happy he can overcome that and be comfortable in his skin.

Let's go see that latest mass Marketed flip at cinema and pretended to give a crap about it while using it opportunity to hang out with each other amd strengthen our bonds.
<comment>
That's useful to know, I had no idea you could buy it over the counter actually, or there was one for guys. Is your beard hair dark and coarse? I have seen some women with beards who actually pull them off, but get it's not exactly a conventionally attractive look for most.

Fucking...what?
<comment>
Yeah just look into nair for men! All the results I found are for pubic region and body, but Im sure theres one specific for face/neck. 
Is your beard hair dark and coarse?
Its not really a beard. I get dark coarse hairs in specific spots on my chin and upper lip. Its always the same spot. Its not noticeable unless you really looking in those spots, but the areas are more dark. Its getting too much to keep up with at this point. I didnt have one single facial hair until I turned 22, now its all down hill lol.

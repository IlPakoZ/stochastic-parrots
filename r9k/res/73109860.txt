I just realized that no matter what no woman i think is pretty will ever be physically attracted to me. There's literally no hope from here. Do i kill myself? Is there any way of god forgiving that?

To put it bluntly, you either
a. Find another way to spend your time on this earth or
b. Kill yourself
It's really all up to you, anon

well describe what you look like first and your type

I can't even think of anything i find any pleasure in atleast long term that doesn't have to do with the pursuit of pussy

A short skinny girl is too much to ask for when i'm in shape myself....? that's really the state of things huh?
I can't wait for world war 3 i hope it kills off all of humanity and wipes us from the face of the earth

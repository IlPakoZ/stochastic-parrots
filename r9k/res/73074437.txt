Chudcels...it's literally over...

I'm not your father, if I have to mask my flaws (which include insecurities) around you, then I'm not going to date you. It is that simple. Try growing up and acting like an adult and accepting that people have flaws that you need to live with. Or you can just have 10 cats when you are older.

women say these things, and then conveniently leave out that all their boyfriends have all these traits they say "don't matter"
<comment>
I care because my skull looks awful and it's a perfect portrayal of what I am. Subhuman and animalistic.

The hole is literally saying you can be fat and bald, what kinda delusion is this?
<comment>
Uniromically yes. If you stepped outside for once you'd see fat guys with girlfriends.
<comment>
You dont actually believe this. It is just a set up for the punchline of telling anyone who disagrees with your anecdote that they do not go outside.
<comment>
Are you implying there aren't tons of fat balding dudes with girlfriends?
<comment>
Lol. 
I was smart, popular and tough. 
Was always suicidal, but I found enough entertainment as a teen/young adult to keep me interested. 
Now it's just a matter of the least harmful (to others) exit.
The second I realised I didn't care about what anyone thought, I realised my own view of the world and that I hated it here. 
I have always had girlfriends and married a virgin who had never been with other guys. 
Well, she'll be a reasonably-off woman in her 30s once I exit. No kids, hope she can find someone decent, unless you or I.

It would be great if this were the honest truth and for all I know it is, but not really great for me personally, I still have the personality and backbone of a wet paper towel and always will, it's something ingrained in me since I was a child. I will never command respect or even be commonly liked, even if I "own" my flaws, I'm too deeply uncomfortable to constantly pull that bravado from nothing. A compliment like "you have a nice voice" can put me over the moon for a day, but going ignored the next will completely crush me and make me retreat back into myself for weeks. I don't want to have to be the perfect stoic tough guy that's also the right amount of fun, I just want to be vulnerable old me and for that to be okay, but it never is.
<comment>
And how many of them are incels?
<comment>
What the fuck are you talking about? This is just incoherent rambling.
<comment>
stop being insecure about being bald 
women still don't find baldies
wow you really fixed that one, I'm so fucking impressed
<comment>
Honestly I will say that if that deformed inbred motherfucker Cyrax can get not one, but MULTIPLE gfs, then most incels could manage the same too. That said for me most people are just too irritating to get to that level, and I know it and own up to it.

do you really think that perfect hair could ever replace that masculine presence or self esteem
i'm not even balding, so i'm not insecure about hair loss, c'mon, who're you trying to fool? hair is like 6,000,000x more important than 
le aura you exude
i think this chick's just insecure and can't cope with it when they see that these same flaws which make her merely upset, ruin men's entire lives. gives her the idea that she should be insecure and that it's not all in her head that her being fat or something is a bad thing.

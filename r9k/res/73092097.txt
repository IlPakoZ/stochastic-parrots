It's nice at times, but there's a reason most people moved on. Because in retrospect, it was faggy and overused.
The 'sharty style of humor will eventually die out. Though I don't believe in a lot of what Marx has to say, one of his critiques of capitalism was how the desire for constant growth will eventually fail and bring the whole system down.
We're most likely going to experience something like this with humor. Don't worry about it too much, things will get better.

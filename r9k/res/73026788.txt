be me, 25 year old guy
got fat because i have an office job and don't workout, almost double chin tier but i'm tall so everyone didn't see it that much
decide to go to a doctor for a diet
start it and start losing fat
now, after 5 months i have lost 10 kg and my face is all skinny again
still got tons of visceral fat
my doctor says i just need 2 cm less on the waist and i'm done
I'm not asking to have a flat belly but i should lose more than just 2 cm. Idk, i think if i continue like this i become a skeleton with a pizza belly but i don't like working out (i only fast walk for an hour and half a day)

Make it serious, funny, sad or whatever as long as you have fun.
I'll start:
What the hell is wrong with men? Am I really supposed to take care of him like a little kid? I have to cook and do everything for two persons as if I wasn't busy enough.
This weekend I wasn't able to shop for groceries and sent him to buy enough for the week... I didn't even know how to react when I came back home and saw all he bought were frozen pizzas, bags of snacks and a bunch of soda bottles.
It's only been one week and a half and I don't know if I won't commit a murder if this lasts for too long.
Nice bait thread troon. YWNBAW
Good bait post. I almost fell for it
I was a little sorry for you, not ironically.
I don't need to pretend to be a woman because according to society I am one for being a tranny.
Sure I'll pretend
I think Snoopy and Woodstock are cute, but I otherwise don't care much for this comic strip. Charlie Brown's too miserable for my liking.
(did I do a good job?)
Honestly, yeah. I'm impressed. Simple but on point.
you have some serious self hatred op. your attempt at being a woman is just shitting on men.
I either failed my thread or failed to understand other anons because I believe people took me seriously.
i literally don't care about height, like why do men think it matters so much?? all my exes were like 5'8 and honestly idk what else to say to u guys. their personality was just shit and desu they yelled at me and made me cry after i did uplifted them and they left me for stacy. now i have a 6'2 bf and you all call me chad only stfu.
you didn't clean up your cousin's piss?
I actually have a piss fetish but it is too embarrassing to tell it to other anons.
But there's gotta be at least one woman out there who enjoys Peanuts, right?
Would you have succeeded in forming a romantic relationship with your high school crush if the genders were reversed?

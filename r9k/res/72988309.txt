Make it serious, funny, sad or whatever as long as you have fun.
I'll start:
be me
20 years old cousin comes to live with me for until he finds a place for uni
didn't want to but "muh family"
have some hope it won't be too bad
should'vehopeharder.jpg
first day here he broke the glass I had since I'm 7
he doesn't know how to do the dishes and everything always ends up greasy
he doesn't know what a broom or vacuum cleaner is
there is piss all over the toilet seat
AND THE FLOOR
he flushes only when it starts to smell
doing the laundry being too "complicated", letting his dirty clothes on the floor is apparently the best option
What the hell is wrong with men? Am I really supposed to take care of him like a little kid? I have to cook and do everything for two persons as if I wasn't busy enough.
This weekend I wasn't able to shop for groceries and sent him to buy enough for the week... I didn't even know how to react when I came back home and saw all he bought were frozen pizzas, bags of snacks and a bunch of soda bottles.
It's only been one week and a half and I don't know if I won't commit a murder if this lasts for too long.

I was a little sorry for you, not ironically.

I don't need to pretend to be a woman because according to society I am one for being a tranny.
<comment>
Sure I'll pretend
boo hoo I have it so hard
actually has it easy

I think Snoopy and Woodstock are cute, but I otherwise don't care much for this comic strip. Charlie Brown's too miserable for my liking.
(did I do a good job?)
<comment>
Honestly, yeah. I'm impressed. Simple but on point.

you have some serious self hatred op. your attempt at being a woman is just shitting on men.
be child me (female)
mom wants me to hate my dad and protect her from him
wait, i don't feel the societal pressure of being her little man because i have a pussy
i don't feel guilt for taking his side against her
become daddy's girl and through the power of my pussy i cure his alcoholism 
i behead my mom (metaphorically) and take her place
my oedipal complex has resolution and my neurosis is cured (i'm also not gay anymore since i'm a woman now)
clap

I either failed my thread or failed to understand other anons because I believe people took me seriously.

you didn't clean up your cousin's piss?
<comment>
I actually have a piss fetish but it is too embarrassing to tell it to other anons.

But there's gotta be at least one woman out there who enjoys Peanuts, right?

Would you have succeeded in forming a romantic relationship with your high school crush if the genders were reversed?

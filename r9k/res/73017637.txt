I'm feeling more chipper than usual today, and I wanna spread this joy.
I hear letting out your frustrations can make you feel better, so ITT, let 'em all out!
Hey fren hope you're good. I am not doing so well, and haven't been for a long time. I'm just done with life. What's worse is there's no real reason for me to feel this way aside from my chronic loneliness, obesity, anhedonia, virginity, living with parents at age 27, lack of friends, lack of driver's license, poorly paid job, crippling anxiety, and back issues.
i should sleep, but I can't I got work in a couple hrs and I'm night shift its going to be a rough night.

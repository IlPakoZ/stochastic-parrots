I'm gonna be honest, I don't care if women have more privileges or advantages than men, thats life. What annoys me is how women will do anything to deny they have any advantage they have above men and will always claim to be "oppressed". Just look at someone like Bella Poarch, she got famous by literally just existing. Fair play if I was her I'd go alone with it too, but why can't they admit they're privileged?

I think women should, in fact, have more privileges than men

Because victimhood is a currency in current society.
Admitting that you're not oppressed or a victim nowadays is akin to burning all your money.
And since victimhood has no number attached to it like bank account, they can always pretend that they're the most oppressest, all while stomping on people who by any objective measurement have less social capital and call them oppressors.
Sick and twisted, but that's Clownworld.
Not sure if it will ever change.

white people have been doing that for centuries. you try to tell a white man he has privileges and too many advantages in life and he will often deny it even in the face of evidence.

Yeah like it would be more respectable if they said "women are superior, we deserve more." But instead they go around acting like society literally marginalizes women like black saves in the antebellum south.

Why collecting porn on my computer is more fun and exciting than watching it? 
I've been starting to download it this year for the first time and is something very fun about it. I barely watch it.

Sounds like you have an autistic obsession to collect porn. Congratulations.

The annoying part is not finding torrents with the onlyfans shit I want.

Kinda. I also enjoy to know more about the girl. Like if she has a bf or shit like that.

Hoarding porn is cringe if it's vanilla.
Hoarding porn makes sense if it is obscure fetish or torrented.

Cringe as fuck. Why care? Women exist solely to bring pleasure to my dick, couldn't care less about them beyond that

Yeah, that fits for an autistic collection. You basically want to monopolize that information and collect what interests you.

I've never understood porn collectors. I just get an animalistic impulse and take care of it as quick as possible.

Yeah Idgaf about the girl. If she has a family or bf It is more pathetic for them and her, I enjoy that idea. 
Saw an onlyfans girl showing her bf who also was her manager. Such a pathetic dude, has to arrange which next guy will fuck her gf for a few bucks.

I don't feel autistic at all tho but I see it. I have a normal life, gf, friends and shit.

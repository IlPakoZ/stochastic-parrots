Workplace is 80% women
Still no cute nurse gf
<comment>
That's because you work a woman job. Nobody respects men who work women jobs like a elementary school teacher or a dental hygienist.

What about high school teachers
<comment>
Women go into nursing to marry a doctor, not the tard wrangler or the security guard.
<comment>
High school teacher isn't exactly a macho profession, but way more acceptable than elementary teacher. Only thing I could think of is worse is daycare ... Teacher or whatever they call em. Then people know you're a freak.

If you're a man and you want to go into teaching that's one of the few fields you get diversity points instead of foids. Schools are desperate for more teachers in general but especially male teachers. Since so many kids are raised by single moms schools try to provide some male role models for them with male teachers. Also men tend to teach math or science more often than women do and those subjects are harder to fill.

Extremely homosexual eyebrows

Came here to say this. I respect the fluff, OP. lso the sheer amount of time and bullshit that your job position requires, the nurse game ain't easy.

Is this the exact same photo as last time? I remember you.
Did you follow my advice to pick up an autistic femoid dominated hobby and search for poon there?

"Just be a doctor bro"
Spoken like people who truly don't work in a hospital. Newsflash: doctors are almost always married to fellow doctors. The female doctors in my hospital usually have enough rocks on their marriage bands to buy a small mansion. 
Thanks. I plan on growing it down to my shoulders, possibly longer if I find that the long hair look suits me. I'm just extremely sick of the fact that modern trendy men's haircuts are all some sort of fade. The short on the sides and 2-4 inches on the top thing is so stale. I'm not trying to look like your average scuzzball on a UK college campus. 
lol
What does this even mean?

Eh probably. Been too lazy to take fuckboy selfies while at work lately.

No. I'm moving in about 3 months so I've sort of given up on serious dating. No point in dating when I'll be dipping out soon. I just fuck my fwb whenever she messages me. What hobbies did you suggest though?

What do you think it means, big boy?
<comment>
They think of you as one of them, they want to date the doctor not one of the nurses. You seem pretty good looking tho so it balances out. You'll probably get a girl eventually no stress
<comment>
I think you're projecting your closeted homosexuality. I prescribe immediate downloading of Grindr.

Idk man. It seems like every woman my age or younger wants nothing to do with me and every woman older than me is already married. It's like single women don't exist and I'm not about to start crawling around dating apps or bars.
<comment>
It's 2023 bro I'm sorry to say but dating apps and bars have a pretty firm monopoly on dating. Some good people do actually use dating apps, there's also a wide variety of bars in most big cities. Find a bar that has more wholesome girls, for example, I go to this poetry/ literature bar. There are a bunch of respectful cute girls there.
you gotta adapt to the modern age

lol they sure as shit ain't matching with me. Every time I use online dating I get nothing but women who ghost and hookups/fwbs with fat women. It's impossible for me to keep the apps downloaded for longer than a few weeks because of how actively demoralizing it is.
there's also a wide variety of bars in most big cities
I don't live in a big city and I despise cities. Higher COL just to live in a concrete jungle disconnected from the natural world? Yeah no thanks. Unfortunately I'll probably be forced into urban living by my future career.

Probably the least appetizing string of letters I've seen in months.

I am going into nursing and this is discouraging. I plan on moving to Europe sometime soon after graduating though. You have a fwb and still find it this hard to get a gf?

gigabased and iktfb. wish i worked there to bro out with you no homo
<comment>
Realistically speaking, if spending 80% of your time in an environment with women your age can't get you a gf, what can? Modern life is just fucked.
<comment>
Nurses marry cops. It's clear you've never worked in a hospital. They fucking hate doctors and for good reason.
<comment>
Nurses are Stacy af, what makes you think theyd want some feminine manlet? Especially one working as a nurse? The most they see you as is a potential token gay friend, they're probably disappointed and disgusted when they find out you're straight
<comment>
You need to work out, those arms are laughable. Do the other nurses even ask you for help when they need to move something heavy?
<comment>
Moids shouldnt be allowed to be nurses they rape patients
<comment>
tfw nurse wife
<comment>
male nurses are so hideous they make me gag much like female "ramgers" ugh
<comment>
as someone who works in a school cafeteria, i don't think being an elementary or middle school teacher innately demands bizarre provacties, but the way i see so many teachers treat children just looks like a bizzare power trip that only an unstable person would do. Granted, my position as the lunch guy gives me a more relaxed albiet impersonal relationship with students but god damn i watched a teacher instrunct kids to face a wall on their knees with their hands clasped behind their heads like they were about to be shot. Like really what could they have done to warrant that as a punishment?
<comment>
What's a ramger? Ram ranch? Misspelled ranger?
It's not gay if the brows aren't touching. He doesn't have a unibrow so it's fine.
<comment>
I'm considering nursing school but I hate the thought of working with people like OP
<comment>
I've thought about being a pharm tech but after experiencing how incompetent such people are as a customer i am put off by the idea of working with actual zombies
<comment>

Woke up with nerve damage on my right ear. Things are only getting better...
Same my brother too? I think something is happening?
When did he get it? Did it heal by itself?
*kisse*
There ya go nonny, hope you feel better.
Thank you anon, wished a kiss would fix a fucking electric shock in my ear.
Put a hot water bottle on your ear when you sleep and stop eating goyslop

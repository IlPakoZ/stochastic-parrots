I've never seen a vagina IRL and I never will.
It's truly over, how can we cope?
goddamn that is one long neck
Ye I noticed it too when looking through my photos so it stuck with me and I choose it just for fun to represent me at 16.
I think it's both the camera and that I actually nowdays do got a kinda long neck compared to most people and a muscular one also. That year my body decide to focus my gains in the neck it seems.
ummm ok. i have?
In all seriousness though senpai I think you're a good looking goy(TM) but you need to leanmax and collagenmax. For the past 10 years you've been the "canadian lumberjack just about to kill you" tier and that's no good. You also look fairly tall (I think you said once you're 6'1 or smth) which is unironically a huge +. Time is ticking and you'll be an oldfag very soon.
you aren't missing out on much. my girlfriends vagina supposedly has the ideal shape, innie and shaved, but it still isn't all that pretty up close.
Fuck off, humble bragger.
Just go to a nude beach
photographs or it didn't happen

After years I finally decided to give Skyrim a try after hearing a lot of praise of it and I am finally enjoying a game again. After Skyrim I will give the other Elder Scrolls games a try.

Skyrim is a really fun game, adding MODs is even better

Thank you very much.
I wanted to play it vanilla first before modding it.

I never got more than an hour into skyrim because I got to the point where it gives you your npc companion and I just noped the fuck out of there, I didn't want to deal with that

Understandable

That's a good way to do it, gives you more of an appreciation for mods when you do go on to use them. Though I'm sure after a while you'll be begging for quality of life mods, like those that make the follower and horse systems far more user friendly for instance.

I just keep her at Breezehome as my wife. She's watching over me when I sleep. I also adopted two daughters.
Yes. Any recommandable mods (that aren't focused on sex)? I don't really have any complaints about my horse anymore. It would always die from fall damage or bother me during fights but now I have Arvak.

I haven't properly played Skyrim for years but some of my favourite mods were:
Enhanced Lighting &amp; FX
Basically makes light sources more realistic and removes artificial light, making the game more immersive and interiors far more cozy. This is personal preference as it kind of necessitates the use of personal light sources (torches, magelight etc. I used in conjunction with a mod called Wearable Lanterns) but I think it has various options about how dark you want it to be.
Pure Weathers
My weather mod of choice, add more different weathers to the game, increases the feeling of variety a lot
Quick Loot
Makes the looting system like the one in Fallout 4
Enhanced Blood Textures
Blood cool. Simple as.
Wet and Cold
Adds some weather effects and makes NPC react to weather by putting on cloaks when it's cold, hood when it's raining etc. (you'd want a mod that adds cloaks to the game as well)
Populated Skyrim
Adds generic NPCs to towns to make them feel less dead, and also to roads and other places, just makes the game feel more alive.
Dual Wield Parrying
Makes Spellsword and dual wielding characters feel much more viable
VioLens
Gives you control over how often kill moves are performed
iHud
Hides the hud when not in use
SkyUI
Makes the inventory easier to use
Deadly Spell Impacts
Adds new effects e.g. burning kills have a chance to turn opponent into ash
Improved Combat Sounds
Makes combat sounds more deep and weighty, surprising how sch a simple thing makes combat feel so much more satisfying.
Just off the top of my head. And I'm sure I used one of the most popular follower and horse overhaul mods. And a bunch more smaller graphics &amp; immersion mods. This was over 5 years ago, mind. Most of these mods will be outdated and have newer versions for the Special Edition, no doubt. And these are all pretty basic mods; this is what people are doing to Skyrim with mods these days:

It's a good game but it's annoying I've purchased it on at least three separate occasions until I settled with the one on my steam account. Bethesda needs to come out with something new it's been over a decade
<comment>
I took a screenshot. Many of the ones seem helpful/useful. I will look them up later.
I appreciate you joining my thread.
They made a game on the Skyrim province, Morrowind and Cyrodiil. Do you think they will do the other ones as well?
<comment>

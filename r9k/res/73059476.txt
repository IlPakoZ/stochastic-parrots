Why do w*men characterize sex as a vital need? Grow the fuck up. Get a hobby. Go on a picnic. Absolutely pathetic.

that's not your average woman. THat's a mental patient

because it is a need. it's literally your biological purpose for living. men just get to be on the shit end of it where we made civilization and in return they can't just sex any woman via rape anymore. at least you have lolis and your parents who love you still, anon. remember this when your last breathe fades and you fall into the darkness one last time.

The husband isn't real. He is supposed to be asleep, but somehow the bitch is saying he is talking to her?

There is no purpose. Its like eating sugar. If it didnt feel good more people would starve. 
You can defeat the urge to eat sugar and pass up on sex. CIVILIZATION IS FOUNDED ON BELIEFS THAT CENTER AROUND DELAYING SEX.

Gay mindset. You have a consciousness. Transcend the need for sex

sex is a human need tho
it's necessary for reproducing your genes and it's necessary for emotional stability in an adults life
honestly fuckin' tired of people in modernity not recognizing this basic fact
civilization is founded on healthy sex, much like civilization is founded on stable sources of healthy foods, like wheat rice fish and beef
it's not no sex, but healthy sex

Don't kill yourself, unless you are a nigger bitch then by all means go for it

I thought you were cute but you ghosted me. So you're just after attention nothing more.

Do what other people do
Change your diet
Do gym and eat protein and shakes
Learn to do makeup and hair like a pro
fake it till you make it
When you see girls online they use photoshop in 90% of images

Lose weight, style your hair, wear makeup, and dress attractively. All these things require money. I hope you're up for it, otherwise wait until you're older and the only thing that matters to anyone around you is how much money you make, and no one cares about sex hardly anymore.

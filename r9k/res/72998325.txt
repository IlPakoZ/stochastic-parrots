had to go to psychologist
turns out it wasn't a psychologist but an addiction counseling
talk about my gaming addiction etc.
asks me what I play and how much
almost all of his questions are tame
be honest with him
didn't have to talk about things that could get me in trouble (except my mother telling him that I am violent and a few other things)
he basically tells me that my life is seriously fucked up and that the little bit of counseling isn't going to help me if I don't go get psychotherapic help somewhere else too
"I know."
he thanks me for my honesty
we shake hands
it's over
All in all it wasn't that bad.
The moral of this story is to abolish addiction counseling as "junk psychology."
Sounds like you both agreed he couldn't help lol
Violence is not the answer. Sublimate all violence into the acquisition of treats.

Homeschooling should be banned
My twin brother and I were homeschooled, but I at least had dance school for socializing. The difference between us is night and day.
<comment>
But wouldn't the rest of the kids also be going to public school in your dance class? Wouldn't it be a bit weird?
<comment>
Yes, most of them did; but no, it didn't make things weird. Well... not for me, anyway.

Parents should be forced to surrender their offspring to the piss-poor education system
no thanks sweaty
<comment>
The "education" they get isn't the most important part, it's the socialisation.
<comment>
the education is not the most important part of school
As expected of third-world scum without Americanized spelling.
<comment>
Agreed socialization is far more important than any other knowledge. I've seen many posts on 4chan and reddit about people complaining that well working introverts are less valued than lazy extraverts.
<comment>
anon so condition that they don't know anyway of socializing outside of work and school
If anything homeschooling helps you learn how to talk to people outside of forced environments.

homeschool guarantees your son becomes a falsely diagnosed autistic asocial NEET. Public or private schooling is better.
<comment>
Nope I'm not allowing you to dictate that my children should be pozzed bybthe federal government and forced to reside along niggers
<comment>
Have fun having autistic children that are overly dependent on you.

I remember in 7th grade my school cancelled a cool trip to some kind of summer camp style thing that we were meant to do.
They tried to convince us that too many kids in our grade were doing poorly academically. The whole thing was very shady, and looking back it was pretty much abuse. They obviously had our grade results before announcing the trip. The entire idea of us doing poorly is just dubious in general. And if anything it's their responsibility to make sure that the kids are actually learning. If they thought cancelling some trip would make us try harder... lmao. 
Looking back, it was really fucked up that we were forced to spend so much time around other kids with so much access to fuck up our lives during a super impressionable time. So much stuff was 'gay' or otherwise bullied out of existence. Showing a genuine interest in things was laughed at, and it was seen as better to just be an effortless Chad who just coasts through everything, but is also really good at sports, the only true thing that matters.

Send boys to public school and homeschool girls.
All problems solved
<comment>
Well that's gay
Unless you want boys to be gay?
<comment>
State cocksucker.
<comment>
you look at the state of the average public school zoomer and tell me you want your kids to be like that.
my kids are going to a private school which I will carefully vet before sending them there. 
the other annoying meme is that putting your kid in various extracurriculars will somehow make them resent you. that's such a fucking lie that it HAS to have be a psyop. parents who actually give a shit about their kid's development are seen as villains while sending them off to play on an ipad all day while brown mutts disrupt their class and brawl constantly is "normal" and good.
<comment>
Move to Europe then.

while brown mutts disrupt their class and brawl constantly is "normal" and good
"Europe is different"
oh boy...

America is doomed to failure. Get out before you can't.

yeah, but you'll get to shoot back at least

And then get sued to oblivion? No thanks.

For literally all of human history prior to around the 1870's, no one - NO ONE - spent their entire day with an age-segregated group of other children they were not related to by blood. No one.
Because you're sheep, you have the idea that it's "natural" to spend your day sequestered in a room with twenty other children the same age as you, but there's nothing natural about it at all. It's profoundly unnatural, since for most of human history the other kids you would have spent all your time around were your siblings, who (other than twins) are NEVER the same age as you.
Your "peers" are the worst possible group for you to spend any large amount of time with. It's much more "human" to be around a group of mixed ages - adults, kids a little older and younger than you. Your "peers" by definition have nothing to teach you and don't need you.

What a cope lol
I hate my brother I wished I stayed in public school so that I could see people who aren't him.
<comment>
I live in europe and in my entire life ive seen 3 asians, 2 blacks and 0 browns in my city. The chinese run a bootleg goods store, the blacks are skinny somalians who play soccer for the local team. The school system is pretty good, too. I live in a slavic country, which is pretty racist, so that might be the reason.
<comment>
was homeschooled for the majority of my life
finally went to highschool and realized how inadequate i was compared to my peers 
due to living a sheltered life i lacked the social skills to make real friends
ended up being mostly hated and bullied for being weird
couldn't figure out why 
blamed everyone else and cut myself off from any sort of human interaction 
never joined any clubs or anything so i lack any talents or things that make me special because i felt i didn't fit in 
now i can barely even look other people in the eye when theyre talking to me
never had a friendship with a real girl
never had a relationship with a real girl 
never had a friendship with a real guy
only talk to people on discord 
homeschool sucks it makes you so socially broken
<comment>
IF I were to homeschool my child (big IF, since i will probably die a KHHV) I would make sure he goes to a shitton if activities to not make him socially stunted. Sports, martial arts, music school, language classes... However, i have to think what kind of person believes they are qualified and well-equipped to teach a child. I am about to finish my degree in mathematics, i speak 5 languages, am well-versed in classical literature, know and have read most of western philosophy, have a diploma in music theory, am quite fit, black belt in a few martial arts, know some kinesiology, how to program a bodybuilding/recovery/powerlifting routine, was competing on a national level in all STEM subjects, ...
and i don't think i could teach. Because i know that there are a lot of things i don't know. I think only narcissists want to homeschool their children. A good parent will steer their child in the right direction, the state will indoctrinate and take your child only if you let it. Unless you livecin America, lol then you're fucked either way. What a shithole.

Ball pythons should be banned.
<comment>
Cope. Your genes made you broken.
<comment>
if we criminalize homeschooling, only criminals will homeschool
<comment>
this but kinda unironically. How the fuck would anyone even enforce a law against home schooling? At what point would it be considered home schooling? Are children forbidden from asking their parents questions in this dystopian world you wish to live in?
<comment>
It's pretty obvious that the problem in your life is that you went to that high school.
So the problem is that you STOPPED homeschooling.
<comment>
How is anon supposed to get a job if he doesn't know anybody?

Almost no kids with an IQ of 120 or above actually learn anything in school.
You're afraid that you don't know enough, and that's silly. When I was in middle school and high school, I would read the textbooks the first week of school and literally didn't learn anything else the entire time. Sitting there watching normies fucking stumble their way through nine months of classes was a gigantic fucking waste of time.
<comment>
Homeschooling is fine, there should just be more strict restrictions around it.
Minimum number of people learning together and qualifications for teaching, as well as testing for the students should be mandatory.
<comment>
this dude read the fucking textbooks
kek what an idiot
<comment>
Yes, i had the same experience, but i didn't let it get to my head. Because i knew that there was always a bigger fish. You just have to go deep enough. For example, when i went into mathematics, i got into a real good, proper fucked up draconic university. I was struggling with set theory, had to ACTUALLY study for the first time in my life - but i knew a guy that was an olympian, medal and all - and he was strolling through college like i was through high school. 
So my point is - if i couldn't understand how that 170iq savant could understand college-level theoretical mathematics so easily, how could i lower myself to the level of someone who finds high school level crap to be hard? I could never teach someone like that, because i simply cannot put myself in that perspective.
<comment>
did you know about it because you read it in 'Hogwarts: A History'?
<comment>
Almost. Hermione was still delighted to be there, because she lived for showing off.
I got my fill of showing off by 6th grade. Especially because I figured out early how much it made other people hate your fucking guts.
So I had no joy in it at all. I hated being there, and felt like the entire system had been set up specifically to waste my time and annoy me. To force me to be there for the principle of requiring it, because they had to require the normies to be there for long periods of time if they were going to learn anything at all.
And teachers absolutely suck at teaching, in any event. The textbook is a vastly better teacher than any of them, when you just fucking read it - which naturally none of the normies do. A teacher standing up and speaking off the cuff will never be as precise or as organized as the textbook. And in subjects where you need to understand the way concepts fit together, precision and organization are absolute musts. It actively harms your understanding of subjects like that when you listen to a teacher's prattle.

how so? the main problem with homeschooling is that it shelters a kid from the external world. otherwise it would be better than private or public school
<comment>
After the last few years you'd be insane to let the state raise your child. Homeschooling at all time highs for good reason.
<comment>
Okay, but only if students get the legal right to issue a single challenge, per class, of unarmed physical combat to a teacher in order to raise their grade by an entire letter.
<comment>
Cute ball python but I disagree. Public schooling was so fucking awful and there should always be alternatives to that that aren't just expensive private schools.

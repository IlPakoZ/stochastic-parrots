lose virginity at 27
cute girl 
even lets me finish inside her
feels amazing
still dont care about getting a gf
girl assumes we're dating and starts texting me and trying to hang out with me
legitimately dont care about her or her pussy just want to be left alone
too autistic to tell her that
literally forced into a relationship because I'm too autistic to tell her I dont want a girlfriend

decide to come on r9k and brag

so have you tried cuddling with her and other GF perks?

Yep, that's why you shouldn't have sex on the first date. Just keep doing what you want, if you treat her like trash and she likes it you will get a pretty toy, if she has self respect she will just leave you. The only problem is when she is crazy, if she is, then you are just fucked, stay away as much as possible. But that's relationship 101 for you, unfortunately that's how it goes.

See this is why I love to just cuddle and not have sex, men are programmed to sow their seed far and wide, and part of this is developing a distaste for pussy they already cummed inside. I'm sure there's a psychology term for it but I forgot.

Again with not caring about puss. I wouldve believed you the first time but another thread? Lemme guess, youre attractive so boohoo for you being too shy to say no? Why do you want to present not caring about women so much? To make incels seathe? To boost your ego by comparing yourself to neets? Congrats, youre better than us? Is this what you want? Now that you got what you wanted, can you leave this board normie?

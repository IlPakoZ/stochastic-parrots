A friendly reminder that you will never ever be a woman.

My mom keeps going into diabetic shock. Her blood sugar levels have been dropping for a while. I know how it feels.

That's what sucked about my grandma dying too. I helped my mom plan the memorial, craft a cross, pick out a casket, sort through the house, listened to her vent and cry, hugged her, went through pics with her and made a photo board for the funeral, went to the funeral
Then I was just like ughhh I hate this and 15 ish minutes into the funeral I peaced out it was so awkward. Plus random relatives kept hugging me and it was making me so angry. Be prepared for that op 
I hated my grandma sooo much she was a wretched awful abusive drunken bitch and a whore as well and I don't feel sorry she's dead but her death fucked my mom up even worse than her crappy parenting did stupid crone

my dad and grandpa died 2 years ago. dad died from stroke and grandpa passed from natural causes. i dont even care about replies i needed to get it off my chest. i watched my dad cry everyday after my grandpa died and he drank himself to death. that pain doesnt go away. any free time in the day theyre on my mind. grief is hard dude

I was 7 when I watched my mom sobbing because grandma died
my sister was also wheeping like crazy but I didn't feel anything, if anything it was pretty awkward

my brother is the same. he never shows emotion. even my dad on the death bed no emotion

I will be alive to see everyone I know die. I'm okay with this.

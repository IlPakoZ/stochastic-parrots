Why is that on the rare occasion I catch feelings for a woman she's either in a committed relationship or a lesbian. Literally every fucking time.

Are you friends with any of the lesbians you fell in love with?

Because lesbians are often very lovely people so it's quite easy to catch feelings for them.

if you're only interested in unavailable people maybe you don't want a relationship but can't admit it to yourself. kind of woman behavior to be honest.

Yeah I realized that. Loneliness and child abuse= latching onto emotionally unavailable people... Real bitch shit but I'm working though it.
I agree.
No, but I always thought a lesbian friend sounded cool.

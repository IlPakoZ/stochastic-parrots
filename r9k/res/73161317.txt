Any examples of people who have never married or had relationships and are still very successful and have lucrative careers? Doctors, pilots, businessmen?

Fuck
Didnt most of the famous philosophers die unmarried? Is it because of a huge existential crisis or what?

The ones who got married never had a chance to think because their wives kept nagging them.

"Lucrative" I dunno, but famous and respected, sure. Just off the dome, Thoreau died a virgin, Tesla was a weird asexual autist and I have to imagine Diogenes wasn't getting laid terribly often jacking off in a barrel covered in a thin layer of his own shit.

Maybe i should just be like them, but idk im thinking about how other people will perceive me in a challenging career to be unmarried. They were consumed with their work 24/7 and didnt care for anything else

Most successful people (outside of entertainment and porn for obvious reasons) don't advertise how much sex they're having. In fact the topic doesn't come up at all in practical day to day life unless you massively fuck up.

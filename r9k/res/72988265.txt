I'm just trying to gain weight. I can't quite seem to do it though.
If you are severely obese your skin severely stretches out theres no getting around that. Losing that weight leaves it all loose and flappy like that no matter whether its lipo or working out. In fact if it was lipo he'd probably have gotten that skin grafted off a bit too since all that extra skin is probably quite a bit of extra weight.

I'm going to look disgusting no matter what I do, but I want to be more healthy and physically capable. My parents could have prevented this, but they're fat retarded golems who self-harm every day in so many ways even after developing cancer and 20 other diseases

I've been eating less, drinking shit tons of water, walking, and doing mild cardio. Hopefully I can lose some weight with that. 
If you're not extremely obese you won't have as bad skin stretch right?

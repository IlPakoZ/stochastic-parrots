You can't say he's wrong tbqh

He is 100% wrong. The primary benefit of being married is filing taxes jointly to reduce your tax burden. The intention of this privilege is to allow families to pay lower taxes. 
Of course progressives poisoned everything. Childless couples shouldn't have this benefit if they are never planning to have children.

This OP is btfo, The obvious solution to gay marriage is that the state should have nothing to do with marriage and it should be an issue for the church.

At this point the tax breaks for being legally married don't even begin to cover the cost of children so who cares? Let them have their piece of paper.

Chud cares because he wants all minorities to have as miserable of a life as possible.

Most gay couples want to adopt.

what are marital tax breaks
to then abuse the child into another homo.
there's a reason they always turn out wrong, same as the usual of a single-parent marriage, but worse.

I know people (and most modern sources) today will say my definition is wrong, but I still define marriage as being between two people of the opposite sex, with the implication of having children. A gay person has just as much right to get married, but it'll have to be with someone of the opposite sex with the intention of having children together because that's what marriage is. 
I'm not a religious person I just think marriage is a commitment for a specific lifestyle (nuclear families), which gay people aren't going to have (adoption isn't the same). They're free to live a different lifestyle but if they do so they shouldn't get married. I think straight people who don't intend to have children shouldn't get married either. I'm happy for civil partnerships to be given equal benefits/rights as marriage, just don't call it marriage.

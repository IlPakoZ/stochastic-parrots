'That kid' style thread but we all pretend to be Holocaust survivors.
That guy who no one liked and converted to Catholicism for some reason
That guy who had an heirloom gold bracelet
Didn't want the guards to take it so swallowed it, shit it out, and swallowed it again hundreds of times
NEVER washed it even though we had water basins
That guy who attempted to escape by digging a tunnel
Messed up the direction of the tunnel
He dug it straight into the soldiers' quarters and was caught instantly

how did you make the gumbo. cajun cooking depends on a pretty precise spice mixture, and if there's too much okra flavor it's kind of an acquired taste. did you burn the onions? start with jambalaya tho it's way easier

Howd you fuck up gumbo? Shit is def cooking
<comment>
Only a wh*te "person" could fuck up gumbo LMFAO.

Making a roux is kinda tough but if you keep trying and practicing I know you'll get it. Watch some videos on it. I'm not entirely sure if the roux is what you're having trouble with I just know that it's the most difficult thing for just about anybody making gumbo for the first time.

my money is he burned the roux. it's tricky
<comment>
how can i tell if the roux was burned?
<comment>
you overcooked the okra and made it bitter and gooey, didn't you? that should be the only thing you could possibly mess up

Setbacks happen. Adversity is a part of the process. Get back in that fucking kitchen and make as many batches of gumbo as it takes until you get it right.

spend 3 hours making gumbo
don't taste it a single time
amazed when it tastes like shit
I wish I had the level of confidence the average cityslicker cooklet retard has. Hillbilly swamprapist inbred retards can make this dish taste delicious because they bother to actually taste it while they cook.

have you tried making it better?

Maybe you just hate gumbo. I certainly don't like it. I don't hate it, but it's literally just boiled sausages in thick sauce. Cook something better.

There's several shortcuts that even people from Louisiana take to make an easier gumbo. For one, there is pre-made roux that you can buy in either powder form or in jars. I know there's a certain pride in making your own roux, but honestly the store bought kind is often just as good, and there's no risk of burning it. Secondly, and I cannot stress this enough, leave out the fucking okra! And especially don't include no damn tomatoes either! No Cajun raised west of the MIssissippi touches the stuff! Gumbo is just fine without it! And it's one less thing to worry about!

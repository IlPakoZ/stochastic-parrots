I have wanted to die since I was 7 years old
<comment>
Same but since I was 11 and I'm 23 now, too cowardly to ever go through with it but also smart enough not to tell anyone about it because they'd strip away my rights and lock me up "for my own good" while feeding me pills to make me even more of a zombie than I already am. I feel like I'm just wading through purgatory.

I wasn't smart enough to avoid the mental ward lol

Last time I was in a mental ward my mom mentioned how early on I was talking about how much better it would be to be dead.
Any child molestation in your family? Any violence?

No molestation but I got beat up a lot by other kids, and my insane brother, who also beat up dad and mom, but the plus side is i evetually learned how to defend myself and beat up my brother so bad he ended up in the hospital,

Why are so many robots and incels right wing? To me, it makes zero sense for people like us who are autistic, ugly and lonely to vote for people who tout individualism over the people who want to give us lowly dregs of society union jobs, neetbux and free healthcare. Our lives are already so miserable why vote for people who want you to work your ass off and make your life even harder?

I just want lower taxes

Yea beats me but I mean its the same for the ones who are left wing and any wing in general Idk Ive always been a skeptical contrarian or centrist I guess to my core

American politics is shit and right wing everywhere else means upholding tradition that is womsn not allowed to whores and putting value on family.

Right wing supports an environment where you can work and make money, and be left alone. For an ugly autistic robot with valuable skills, this is a good thing for me.
Left wing supports an environment where you're dependant on the graces of the collective to survive - you can live on handouts... so long as "we" like you. Well my whole life the group has disliked me so I don't want a system where you have to be "in" with the consensus or be starved by the state as I would soon be cut off by some bureaucrat lady who disliked me, I'd rather an environment where I can trade my skill and time for money and be left alone.

Congratulations on misunderstanding both right wing and left wing ideology

People who are hateful and misanthropic are generally "right wing" in the American terminology.

Because they wanna see the world burn instead of having an easier life?

Because the left openly hate men
At least the Right will some times listen to men

I'm not super political but it seems the left is all about banning stuff, taking stuff away, raising taxes, removing freedoms. I just want to do whatever I want without anyone bothering me. Right and left both want to raise taxes but right is slightly less obsessed with regulations and stifling freedom. I don't vote so it doesn't make much difference. I voted for Trump because he acted progun. Turns out he's a RINO gun grabber anti 2a same as everyone else. Someone would have to promise to end all foreign aid before I'd vote again. It's insane how much money has been sent to various shitholes while we don't even have functioning roads I'm America. It's insane how much is spent on gibs to people in our country who are a net drain on taxes. I'm resentful. After income tax, social security, sales tax, employer's side tax, gas tax, licenses and permits, property tax, etc. I'd be shocked if we even get to keep half our money. If I invest then they double tax the money I paid income tax on with capital gains tax. US is an overtaxed hellhole with very little in the way of freedom to show for it.

I dunno I'm just anti human alltogether and don't bother with their ape mattersesses. They are all equally evil and want to skin people like me alive.

Left wing politics is a poisoned well. Do I want gibs? Of course. But entirely by coincidence, the gibs party wants to cut your grandson's cock off. Nothing anyone can do about that I suppose.

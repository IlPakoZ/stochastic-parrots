get my first girlfriend at 28
anxious all the time around her out of fear I'll do or say something wrong and she'll dump me
I dont think this is healthy, I might have to dip out of this. Some of us just weren't meant to ever have a partner.
Just stop caring and go with the flow
Correct. The time for these stupid fumbling insecurities was your early teens. Assuming she herself is not 14, she'll be expecting you to have gotten over shit like that a long, long time ago. It's over, call it off and never try again.

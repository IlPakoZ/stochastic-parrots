"I'm so happy that we can spend this weekend together Anon. After all these months of being too shy to talk to each other I feel like we have a lot of catching up to do! Even though we've only been seeing each for a couple of weeks... I already feel like you know more about me than most of my friends! Well this weekend I insist on knowing more about you. And I won't take no for an answer!"

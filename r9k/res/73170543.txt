I'm scared. I don't want to die alone, but I don't want to get hurt
Guess you gotta try just a little bit huh
you'll get hurt, but those days will be forgotten the day you find the right person
Lol pussy, the real tragedy is when you lose your freedom and independence, which happens through chronic pain and disability. Anyone who is genuinely hurt from being lonely is a big fat pussy who doesn't realize how they good they have it.
Get used to being alone, Faggot. No one wants you.
Go outside, go to a park, walk around and just tell people hello. It doesn't even have to be a full conversation. Just smile and say Hi as they walk by. Then, once you can do that, go to a bar without any intention of getting laid and just try to strike up some conversation with people who are also trying to have a good time. Then, once you know how to socialize, THEN you can try and form a natural connection to a romantic suitor. Or learn how to have casual sex, whatever your goals are. Just be willing to adapt instead of being a sad excuse making piece of shit.

Are you male? If not I do not care.
or do it like me. Adapt, get hurt, learn how to socialize despite your disabilities and see the truth that ugly people are shunned in society.
I know it's hard for normalfags to grasp this concept but for some people to "make it" others have to not make it.

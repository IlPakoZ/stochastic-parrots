on tinder
match with a fairly attractive girl
have an interesting and fun conversation
feel like there's a real connection
she suddenly ghosts after a benign comment in the middle of a dialogue
Silly me, for a moment I forgot I was just a temporary distraction until Chad responded. Please enjoy the rest of your day, m'am.
I know you're desperate, anon. I feel that shit, but don't use dating apps. All the women on there are used up roasties. It's not good for your mental health.

i am so glad i finished school before smartphones became popular. zoomers look like suicide fuel. 
i at least managed to get pussy. was a lot easier back then and women were much higher quality.

The problem imo is that they now all compare each other to what is online, they see people with these fake online lives and they can't compete, they all get depressed. Filters, rich kids, expensive materialistic crap, they feel lost
The smart phone killed the internet of old and ruined the lives of people

only women do this. they compare all the boys/men they know to chad mctallgenes and the guys around them go without as a result. the guys are still horny and would fuck if given the chance.

I'm genuinely scared of walking outside these days. zoomers will film you and post on tiktok about any ugly person to laugh at.

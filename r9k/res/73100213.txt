Any other avoidant anons? 
I usually make a good first impression with girls, but pull away after due to fear, which makes the girls bitter at me even though I secretly want to be with them.

Sounds relatable, what exactly is your hangup? I have a small dick complex so I always think "Yeah she may like me now, but that's because she assumes I have a normal six incher"
Especially the part where women become cold and distant afterwards happened to me x times

Negative early life experiences, as well as a girl I met here who ghosted me after I opened up to her. That was years ago and I think I subconsciously realized what my problem was around that time and was trying to coax myself out of my childhood shell to get positive validation and put myself in a positive feedback loop to stop being so introverted and avoidant. Sadly I got unlucky in terms of who I opened up to, in addition to being naive and inexperienced at the time with female attraction. Sadly she set me back very hard since she was avoidant herself in addition to being low empathy with a strict/conservative mindset about what a guy should be. However, I think the older I get though and the more girls I meet, the more I realize that was mostly a her problem and not a me problem. 
I can't really speak to your private issues desu, I don't have similar issues. I guess it would depend how small it is, but even if it's pretty small eventually you'll meet a girl who won't care. I don't think people are joking when they say dating is a numbers game. The worst thing you can do imo is let a negative experience reinforce avoidant behavior or settle down with a good enough person out of fear since there's nothing more fulfilling than a good relationship with genuine synergy and mutual love. We owe ourselves finding that even if the road can be painful.

I won't lie hearing a girl beg you to fuck them is absolute lifefuel, much more than I could ever provide by dissecting what's happened mentally to us and pointing out solutions. I had similar issues to you when I was younger and still do to some extent. You need to have a very high emotional pain tolerance and be willing to get hurt to learn and improve yourself. A lot of the time, people who are very avoidant and callous to others are actually massive pussies who are afraid of emotional pain and willing to hurt others a lot to avoid a small amount of pain themselves. Don't be that person. When it comes to girls I'd just say generally be a person who is cool, interesting, and puts them at ease. Don't be afraid to flex a little bit of your dark triad traits as well because generally women love that. Obviously don't overdo it or emotionally fuck them up just because you can. There are a lot of feminist myths about what women want, ignore them and rely on your personal experiences to show you the truth. 
Glad I could help 
Facts, social media and dating apps have given women delusional self confidence. The silver lining of that is all you have to do to stand out nowadays is not simp, even better if you develop genuine charisma

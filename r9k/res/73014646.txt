Id say Im about an 8/10 maybe better on a good day. Ive had a few girls that were interested in me but I failed all of those talking stages. What the fuck do I do. Am I too socially retarded for girls even if Im good looking?
<comment>
Anti-good looking prejudice is real. I'm tall and conventionally attractive so everyone thinks I'm privileged despite being mentally ill and coming from a poor, dysfuncitonal family.
<comment>
You get it. Im not denying that good looks are helpful but they only help you get one foot in the door. People romanticize you because youre attractive but when they realize youre all fucked up they drop you.

People romanticize you because youre attractive
lol, exactly, I've had people commenting with disappointment that they thought I'd be "romantic" or "cute" after finding out that a boring emotionless autist
<comment>
being good looking and being autistic fucking sucks everyone is so suprised when they meet the "real" you.
<comment>
Have you been able to land any girls despite this? I feel like a lot of people here would just be dismissive and say that we have nothing to complain about
<comment>
You are not 8/10 if you had to "talk" to them. Women will approach you and immediately ask for sex if you are that attractive. You are just ugly.

Go back to the grave, Elliot.

Youre fucking retarded. Elliot roger was conventionally attractive but no girl wanted him because he was an insufferable narcissist

Some would argue that that's impossible.
But attractive mentalcels are a thing.
People whose brain and instincts don't function properly when it comes to intimacy and romance.
Sadly am one of them.

You'll mostly get people who deny your existence, and they're partially correct. If a woman is into you, then any cringe thing you say or do will be endearing or interesting. All your jokes are funny, all your hobbies are interesting. (For the most part).
It only falls apart when you unsuccessfully try to mask your autism. You fall into the uncanny valley, where there's something off about you and it weirds them out. You're better off just leaning into your eccentricities so you come off as genuine. Stop trying to metagame the social interactions, if anything you should be monologuing and sperging out about all your geeky hobbies in order to filter out the ones who won't tolerate you unless your perpetually performing as a normie.
Social performance only applies to ugly people. They have to fall in line and accept their place. Good looking people can talk about and do whatever they're comfortable with.

I am an extremely low functioning autist who has never been able to hold down a job and have had sex with 40 girls
literally just make a profile on a hookup app and ask if they want to hangout, the sex is implied in that scenario, sit on a couch with them and watch a movie and start cuddling and making out, then start escalating, take her top off, grab her butt, robots on here dont even know how to initiate sex baka

To give an example, I had a glow up once I lost 60 pounds, ditched the autism buzz cut and got contacts. I had a girlfriend who I cherished more than anything, but also wicked bad paranoia. Avoided all other girls because I didn't want anyone seeing me talking to them and rumors getting floated that I was flirting with them. (Probably an unfounded fear, but like I said. It was paranoia).
The first approach I got it was clear she was interested and wouldn't leave. I panicked, didn't know what to say to get her to go away, so I started a big long sperg monologue about the dorkiest and unrelatable things I could come up with. I acted REALLY excited about upcoming coin designs coming from the US mint, and how impressive the details are if you view them under a magnifying glass. Big long monologue how you can see every fine detail on something so small. Just really try and steer the conversation into something they don't care about and have nothing to contribute to. Just trying to get her to see me as some coin obsessed weirdo and go away.
Didn't work. They acted fascinated by it and started asking questions. They just pretended to care and also be deeply interested. More panic. Pretended to get a call, said I had to go. She handed me contact information, I didn't follow up on it. Every other time it happened I would try the same kind of thing just to see what would happen. It never worked. You cannot fail if you're showing genuine passion or interest in something as an attractive person, no matter how offbeat and dorky it is. You only fail if you look uncomfortable, awkward, or stilted.
Stop worrying about speaking out of turn or talking about topics that are uninteresting to other people. Those rules do not apply to you if you're attractive.

Thats cringe. I want a girl friend not some two bit whore off tinder. Maybe its just cause Im young and not desperate enough yet but Im not just looking for casual sex. I want a girl that I actually click with
<comment>
He was not attractive. If he were, women would have approached him and asked for sex or just tried to rape him. They did not thus we can conclude he was also unattractive.
<comment>
i was really beautiful when i was like 18-25.
the thing is that i was also autistic introverted :)
women basically threw themselves on me
and i was like - go away! what is your problem?
so only when they like explained it to me i realized
which means i had like 5 girlfriends or something
but i dont want to be with anyone
literary prefer having 100% free time to slack and put into projects
<comment>
I cant tell if this is a meme but if it isnt then I feel sorry for you cause youre so deep into this shit you cant even be saved anm
<comment>
Either this is the most tremendous cope Ive ever seen or youve ascended bro im tryna get like you
<comment>
I want a girl that I actually click with
thats how it starts these days anon
imagine thinking its like the 50s where you have to court a girl jesus christ lmao
its called female empowerment and female choice, you just fuck around for a while and if she likes you then it develops into something more, shes just trying you out like a new pair of shoes
<comment>
I know its not but the point was that I dont want to have random casual sex with hoes then get to know them. Why cant it be the other way around. Is it too much to ask to not fuck on the first link
<comment>
Social performance only applies to ugly people. They have to fall in line and accept their place. Good looking people can talk about and do whatever they're comfortable with.
This is the truth right here, it really lets you be free.
<comment>
I feel like this meme encapsulates your experiences, pic rel.
<comment>
yeah I'm conventionally attractive but way too autistic to figure out when people are hitting on me. I have so much trouble engaging people at their level, I am either boring or psycho.
<comment>
Just use online dating then, doesn't seem hard if you meet the physical conditions.
<comment>
having a good haircut and not to high body fat percentage seems to be decisive for me. still probably never better than just above average so my mental deficiencies cannot be forgiven.
<comment>
Ah one of these threads.
*cracks knuckles*
Erhm...
I have never seen a vagina in real life and I never will.
<comment>
Oh yesterday it went like this:
I was sitting there.
Girl sits next to me.
Glances over to me a lot.
Lightly touches my hand.
Initiates conversation with me.
I just do not know what to do, girl goes away
Happens regularly when I go out.
I am like an 8/10 and 6ft4
Its soooo bad to be attractive and autistic.
When you tell people you have trouble they just insult you.
When you try taking to girls they are completely bewildered because you do not sweep them off their feet like some beast man.
It is completely insane.
I just want a normal cute girl who will just be a loyal nice gf, and I will treat her nice and all but I will need some warmup phase where I will not know what to say, and you need to tell me the things that I do not know, okay? 
Thats all really bad. I am 27 now, it will only get worse from here.
Fucking whores from tinder is absolutely pointless. I picked up girls at the bar myself a few times in the past before being disgusted by the whole process.
Its not that I cant I do not want to do something retarded like this
<comment>
You have sex with whores. You are cringe.
<comment>
Is picrel you? Gained a bunch of weight between 17 and 21 but esp in 17 this person isnt ugly at all
<comment>
God these threads are the worst fucking things ever.
I hate humblebragging so much. I would give anything to live one day as an attractive person, even the most autistic possible attractive person. Knowing for sure the girls who see you have an immediate attraction reaction rather than an immediate disgust reaction is so fucking surreal and the reality that I'll never get that eats at my thoughts everyday.
I hope every non-larping attractive anon in this thread becomes extremely ugly over the next few years so you'll understand what it's like being on the other side. I hate you all
<comment>
I never once got a match on Tinder. Check your fucking pretty boy privilege.
<comment>
you have to just try man. few people are born with great social skills. you have to try and fail and tray and fail and try again. eventually it gets easier as you intuitively figure out what works or doesnt work
i used to be really ugly but then aged into my look i guess. women used to be upset that i talked to them now they get upset if i dont talk to them. life is strange
<comment>
You look unnervingly similar to my cousin up til 17.
<comment>
Elliot Rodger was an 8/9
Yeah fucking right. I must be a 100 then.
<comment>
No one knows the reference because no one watches that shitty show.
<comment>
Yeah whatever bro you just dont want to admit it. He had the jawline, not fat, good face structure. Better looking than most incels.
<comment>
This. Their issue is "buh autism"
its STILL better than autistic and average. Its even better than normal and average because the normal guy gets cheated on.
<comment>
It is not a meme. Women are extremely aggressive with attractive men because they know there are no social consequences for doing things that would get an ugly man killed.
<comment>
yeah but I was only attractive for a short while. From early 2007 to maybe middle of 2008, when I was 19 and 20. Only because that was the only time in my adult life where I wasn't fat.
It was fun for me to see women struggling with me not following along with their cues. But I'm not socially retarded insofar that I can definitely recognize those cues and I know how people expect me to react.
Women get upset when you don't play along. Media likes to say this is a male trait, but the majority of the women I encountered turned real nasty once they figured out that I don't play the game. They flip all of a sudden in to a seething mess, just smoldering with hatred. Lots of swearing, lots of very personal very petty insults. It's fucking hilarious. Seething is precisely the word. Women are very used to getting their way through romantic and sexual manipulation, and when they don't get it, they throw tantrums. I would know when one was about to begin because their voice would always always always shift in to that offended white woman tone.
I even had a 250 lbs. middle-aged woman clock me in the jaw at a Rob Zombie concert afterparty because I had explicitly told her in my hotel room than I was not having sex with her. She called me a tease and tried to kick my ass for real. Fucking bonkers. 
Miss being able to fuck with women like that.

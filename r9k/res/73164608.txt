Being respectful doesn't work unless you're tall. 
Sucks that short dudes HAVE to lift and act like psychopaths to get an iota of respect, but hey.. you created them.

yea this is true
nah this is a serious problem. This kind of shit creates legit psychopaths who will wander the earth looking to pass on their pain, or kill themselves publicly.
If we could be kinder, it would be a kind world. All I'm saying bro.
I think the opposite is true as well where a manlet can get away with being meaner because he's "harmless" while when a tall dude does it they take him seriously and jump him. Each side has it's disadvantages but I don't think they're equally bad.
Yea but people don't want to get away with being meaner. I actually don't even think this is true desu. Ofc taller people would get away with being meaner more often than shorter people
If people think so little of you that they treat you like an impotent harmless child, that's not an advantage for you.
Yea but people don't want to get away with being meaner
Are you European, or have you never visited the more run down areas? Unless you're in a civilization hugbox, you gotta fight or at least look like you can fight to survive. 8 out of 10 manlets I've met were jumpy and aggro, and most of them weren't even that short. They're just adapting to a hostile environment, like Africanized bees. 
It's not cool but it's necessary for them at least.
They have less reason to be mean because they are walking around with literal bludgeoning tools attached to their arms. Unless they get jumped.
Kevin Hart made a career out of that shit.
its already been shown conclusively that taller people are more "aggor" than shorter people literally for that reason: nobody bothers them. So they don't even develop inhibitions about being aggressive. Its completely conclusive facts, not open to discussion or debate.

be femcel
in college class on personal finance
focused on my homework, but listening to class
overhear conversation between some guys about whether or not they'd be okay being a house husband/stay at home dad
all three agree that they could never be a stay at home dad/let their wife pay for everything, it's unfair
half the fun of being in a relationship is spoiling your girlfriend
look up
2 of them are bald, one is a pajeet, all three of them are chinless
its hopeless out here

1/10 terrible start and overall shitty bait

What's the angle? Like you thought they'd be good looking chads hoping to spoil a woman like yourself, then you looked at them and the turned out to be uggos? Or are you saying that you WANT the submissive houseHusband?

It's really not if you take care of yourself. I have a relative who is a houseband with a Stacy wife. I don't mind being one either in particular.

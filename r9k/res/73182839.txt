Do you think that ppl that are killed have alteast a few moments to process what's happening as they die?
Like someone that has a gunshot wound to the head may have enough time to realize "oh shit, im shot whoa"
Ever passed out? If you got shot in your head, your brain loses so much blood pressure that you immediately pass out. So no, you're not thinking anymore at that point.
look at videos of standing people being shot in the head and figure for yourself. 
it looks weird as hell because their knees just go limp.

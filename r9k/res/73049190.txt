I had sex with 37 girls but now I am old and fat and balding and get zero matches on tinder when I used to get 99+ in a day. I havent even had sex since last November. 
Am I a robot or a fakecel? I dont think im a fakecel because I legitimately cannot get sex. But not a robot cause I used to be a slayer.
Am I a fallen normie?

How old are you? You simply might not be showing up on their app anymore. Also becoming ugly is also huge if that part is true.

only 25 about to turn 26, I had a super unhealthy lifestyle and it caught up to me
I smoked, drank, ate nothing but fast food, and used steroids to maintain a good body with zero effort
Currently quit steroids and trying to quit smoking, need to lose about 40 pounds and hoping finasteride can regrow some of my hair

This is your actual problem. Sure losing your looks didn't help, but tons of girls have age cutoffs at 24/25. They aren't left swiping you, you're just not showing up on their app anymore.

Brutal, but I did get a lot of matches in november when I had my hair grown out, I got a buzzcut and get no matches now except with literal 2/10 landwhales
I am waiting for finasteride to thicken up my hair before growing it out again. Also need to lose 40 pounds..
I think I have potential to get back to normie levels if I put enough effort in but ive been on every dating app and going out to clubs twice a week and been getting ZERO female attention

Interesting, and yeah sadly balding is a death sentence for physical attraction unless you want to fill the ripped/bald niche. Sadly I am balding myself, but thankfully my personality is pretty good nowadays.

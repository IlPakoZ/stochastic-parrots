who else here /haunted by monetary mistakes/?
I constantly make the calculation how far behind I am money wise in life from not earning money
every time I think about Improving my life and being forced to go back to irl life and work and do stuff this calculation comes to mind, "I would be this much closer to doing whatever/investing possiblities"
this calculation will never let me sleep and I will forever be constantly reminded unless I make giant leaps and somehow push beyond what I am supposed to be at currently by making alot of money
else I will be cursed to be haunted by this forever and my mistakes, a mistake which cannot be overcome by pure grinding in a normal wage job, because I will forever be behind, the improvements have to come from actual smart moves
this anxiety breaks me down too the limit when thinking about it, only thing is to not care when I am not thinking about how I am progressing my life, but I cant get neetbux and I wont be there, so I am in this cursed mode forever now

hell yeah I gambled almost 30 grand away in a few months during a manic episode and drug binge
now I'm pretty deep in credit card debt from buying booze and fast food and I forgot to mention im a NEET
honestly I'm just waiting for my dad to die already so I can inherit whatever he has left. though I kinda get the stinking feeling he's gonna give it to someone else cause my dad never fucked with me like that.

worrying about how far you could have been is completely pointless. 
in fact a lot of people who always worried about that and put their full effort in staying ahead report that they feel empty and unfulfilled because they've been stressed their entire life.
unironically keep calm and carry on. give some serious thought on whether or not it is within your means to do something about it this year but dont stress yourself out.

yeah stupid move, but I feel even worse since I am sober and never had any bad addictions like this
and less bad if you actually can earn money pretty quickly, that is the determining factor
and how young you are to still recover
my father gambled away most of his money so yep
in fact a lot of people who always worried about that and put their full effort in staying ahead report that they feel empty and unfulfilled because they've been stressed their entire life.
yeah but its not about "staying ahead" really, its about having the bare comfortable minimum, and atleast being ok, im not even in the "ok" category, pretty much everything is fucked up
once you have absolutely nothing you are in panic mode, once you are decently comfortable you can atleast be OK with the situation, there is a stark contrast between them, never the less being rich as fuck
unironically keep calm and carry on. give some serious thought on whether or not it is within your means to do something about it this year but dont stress yourself out.
yes this is easy and logical, "just stay calm and ignore everything that has happened"
too much relaxing and i turn completely potato, not enough relaxing and i turn into anxiety mess
ofcourse there is things to change always, there is always opportunities that i am missing, and i will forever live in the fomo mode of knowing that there is something better that i could do that would yield way better results faster and i am a retard for doing what i am doing currently where other people have chosen better paths and having way more fun and enjoyment while i do retard shit and getting absolutely nothing out of it, this feel alone is brutal, this will only be overcome by money and getting somewhere satisfying in life so far and i am behind
idk

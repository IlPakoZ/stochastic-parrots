I'm so fucking done. My self-esteem is down to 0. I can't believe i'm this fucking repulsive. 
I'm not a bad person. I'm just shy, awkward and a bit boring which isn't a fucking crime.
Why can't I find ONE girl who will like me for who I am???
And no, lookism faggots, it has nothing to do with looks. The last girl who approached me couldn't go a few sentences without telling me how hot I supposedly am, how all her friends were jealous that she got to me first, she literally said and I quote "you're in the top 5 to 1% of males" like some aspie
.
I thought she liked me but a few weeks later she said she's not looking for anything right now and basically ghosted me.
How do you autistic degenerates manage to get pussy? All kinds of weirdos are able to get laid but I somehow can't. 
Am I really this much of a fuckup???
God damn, i'm legitimately suicidal. I can't stand being alone.

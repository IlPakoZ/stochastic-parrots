I took the JBN (just be nice) pill and have noticed that people are nicer to me too now. I also just feel calmer and happier instead of being an insane neurotic schizo constantly thinking that people are evil and want to hurt me.

It really depends on where you live but people generally aren't that evil. You can be nice to people, but you should also always try to look out for signs that people might be looking to exploit you.

I just tried to be nice to people because being an isolated fearful schizo was making me very miserable and I figured that if JBN theory failed I could just go back to being isolated. Also just trying to focus on the times people were nice to me instead of reliving the same few shitty memories over and over and using them as a justification to hate everyone.
By nice I mean mostly just asking people about their day, helping out if I can (without excessive self-sacrifice of course) as opposed to totally ignoring everyone or being outright rude. You don't have to be a pushover or let people abuse you.

I hope you enjoy your show trial for impersonization.
The 8 rabid clowns in my dungeon are going to like you.
i'm the god of NEETdom tho
soon i'll ascend though, maybe
ive been a neet for 13 years.. actually 12 if u count all the times i got a job and quit because i dont like people telling me what to do
17 years for me. Wage-cucked for a year at the end of my twenties and found out I was aspie, which explained why I was such an inherent NEET and unemployable in this piece of shit service economy. Now I have zero options, but to cling to my basic NEETbux and try and get an autism diagnosis, so they have to leave me on 'limited capability' forever on zero appointments. UBI is the real dream, so I never have to worry about the endless harassment of mandatory appointments, assessments and courses ever again. I just want to rot in peace and have a quick death in middle age.

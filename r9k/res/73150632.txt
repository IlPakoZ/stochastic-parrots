I get loads of matches on Tinder etc but I literally get ghosted after every first date or hit with a "we'd be best as friends." Am I just incredibly ugly or is it my mannerisms?
If you're getting matches and dates you're obviously not ugly
Just keep grinding bro. You are bound to have a lot of "failed" dates before you meet the right one. It would be very unlikely if your future wife was one of the first ones you meet. Most of us aren't that lucky.
tinder got me acting super sad
I implore you to kill yourself
its your awkward mannerisms. maybe the way you dress or smell too.
if you were ugly you wouldn't get matches.

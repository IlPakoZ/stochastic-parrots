I have nothing going for me. I'll never have anything going for me. No girl has or ever will have a reason to wanna date me
I have nothing going for me
How come?
I'll never have anything going for me
You can never be certain
How come
Dead end job, no valuable skills, short, ugly, no future plans, poor social skills, etc
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
same. i just want the pain to stop
There's always hope that things'll get better, right?

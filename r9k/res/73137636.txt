So this is it? I'm going to spend the rest of my life coping with the fact I will never achieve the life I want to live because it is impossible for me to become that person?
maybe you should go build a shed or something
normies don't want you to know this one simple trick - you never realized daydreaming about the life you want to live is literally the exact same thing as living it?
Tell me anon, what is the life you want to live? What is your dream in life?
Why would I do that.
It doesn't feel the same at all to me.
I desire either in this world or an isekai that I become an eternally young cute girl in perfect physical and mental health and I get to live a rose tinted comfy life enjoying the world and my body
It's a stupid wish, but it's mine. Anyways, obviously this is never happening.

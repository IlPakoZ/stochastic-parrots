How do I even tell my therapist that I don't find life meaningful at all and just want to stop existing? It's not even in the depressing type of way, I just don't see the point in any of it. I can't tell my therapist the reason why I do extreme sports is because I hope I die in an accident, he would probably assume I'm depressed. I'm not depressed, I just don't have nothing that would make live worth living.

I have to word it really carefully, it needs to sound passive, like I'm the victim of it and like I don't want it to be this way
"I don't deserve this" "I feel impending doom"
but, dude, you are depressed.

sounds like maybe you should start with
"i am thinking that committing suicide would be okay"
and see what she does with that

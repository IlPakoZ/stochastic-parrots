Femanons, if there are any or I choose to believe there are any, do you think pothead boys are cute?

They smell really weird. 
It would be preferable if they just stuck to the brownies and stuff instead of blowing smoke everywhere.

like the other anon said, as long as it's not smoked i'm pretty neutral.

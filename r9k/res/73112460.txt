NTA but Retard-san I just want to be left alone. I'm a robot through and through and like many have come to the conclusion that not everyone is meant to be a winner. It's a hard thing to cope with and accept but I'm trying my best to do so. No offense but myself and from the looks of it others just don't appreciate you and your bf shoving your fucking relationship down our throats. It hurts. I'm glad you're happy with your boyfriend and he is happy with you. That's great. But the posts you both make daily start to feel like mockery, even if it's not your intention. /r9k/ is the only place I have to go to get away in peace from normalfags, even if the board isn't like it used to be. 
All that being said, I do appreciate that you have a trip I can filter. You seem like you are a lovely person to interact with so it's a shame its come to that. However, Tranny-kun doesn't so what good is it? When he lovey dovey posts, there's no getting away from it. I hope you both understand where I'm coming from and your relationship thrives.
Also obligatory get off my board normalfags reeeeee
<comment>
You can filter a few phrases like "my gf" to filter a lot of normalfags, but this board is like 95% normalfags anyhow.
<comment>
Rrminder this isn't debunked. It is them and they're doing some major damage conyrol hard over it.
<comment>
"my gf" to filter a lot of normalfags
You would think so, but most of the time it's just filtering out greentexts where they're quoting someone else or similar
95% normalfags anyhow
It's not that bad yet and I hope it never is. But that's just more copium on my part I'm sure. Anyway I have most of those filtered, these type of threads are the only ones that seem to slip through.
<comment>
is like 95% normalfags
and you and your tranner bf heavily contribute to that
<comment>
It was posted to reddit before she ever went to the airport.
Then filter "my trans gf" using regex or something.
It's not that bad yet
It definitely is. Do we browse the same board or is your bar for normalfag just really high?
Not really lol.
<comment>

I still get a good amount of threads even with the filter on, there's still a sizable amount of robots left. You have to keep in mind that r9k wasn't as big or as fast when robots were the majority and not the minority. The normalfag to robot ratio has been decent lately compared to other years. Although most of them come in the later hours of the day.
<comment>
Not really lol.
nigga you're a normalfag, you literally are retard lol
<comment>
Every time I see an """incel general""" or whatever, it's mostly guys saying "yeah girls liked me but I didn't realize it /shrug" or "my LDR gf never met up with me :'((((". The vast majority of the rest of them have had 0-1 rejections over the course of their entire life. Where are the actual robot threads?
<comment>
i-it was posted before he was at the airport i-i swear!
Truly convincing.
<comment>
I don't heavily contribute to it, still.

Reddit thread was made on march 4th.
<comment>
oh no no NO NO NO PFFFFFT AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<comment>
From what I've read in other threads, the tranny one didn't start hrt until it was in its twenties and its grandma still calls it manuel so I doubt that picture is really them. Manny is supposed to look like kurisu from steins gate
<comment>
Robots and incels are not interchangeable. Incels can be robots but not all incels are robots. I'm assuming you didn't browse this board until 2017 at the earliest, maybe give or take a year. The term started to get misused when we had an influx of normalfags combined with the /pol/ and /lgbt/ raids from back then. Also it's heavily glossed over how it wasn't black and white, there's other tiers newfags don't consider anymore. Anyway, I'm rambling now, sorry. See ya normie.
<comment>
Tranny kun got here no earlier than Christmas. Not only is he entirely unaware of the traditional definition of robot, he did not recognize Eliza. I would argue that nobody can lurk or use this board for six months without knowing who she is.
<comment>
I'm guessing you're a normalfaggot who thinks himself a robot, then.
I'm probably one of the only people here who posted on 8/r9k/. I don't recognize every single pic of whichever eslut you worship, dough.
<comment>
I have no idea what any of you retards are talking about. I have no idea who tranny-kun and retard-san are, I don't even know which is which from the pic and no one is saying. Is this a fucking joke?

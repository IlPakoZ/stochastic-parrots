The more I look at human society, the stupider it seems.
Our society is constantly searching for an answer to some problem it has created, like the energy crisis.
Now it seems that AI is the answer to everything. But then AI will just remove 30% of our jobs creating even more "welfare leeches" and now we have another huge issue waiting to be fixed.
Humanity is very nearsighted. Nobody stops to think about the big picture. It's like society has a headache and the solution is to hit the big toe with a hammer as well.

When I look at humanity from a perspective, it's almost crippling how retarded this species is.
I think the greatest display of intelligence is dropping out from schools and becoming a maladjusted "loser" individual.
That way at least you can say you couldnt perform in a broken system. It's not a display of intelligence to be perfectly adjusted to a retarded system.

there isn't a system you're not part of, take your fucking meds.

You are referring to humanity as some unified entity when in reality it's a highly fractured 5% that actually has any control or power. Nobody thinks about 'le big picture' because there is nobody to think about the big picture nor anybody who could muster control over it, just individuals constantly rivaling over power and pursuing their own individualistic goals.

Youre too stupid to see the future potential of AI. How ironic. The "everyone is stupid" is gradeschool 85 IQ dribble.

There is none. Give me counter examples.
That's not my words, I dont think AI will help us at all. AI will be used to remove jobs and privacy. It will be implemented as a monitoring tool. It knows how we think

We dont need shit like that. We dont need one more magical algorithm or framework in this world. What we need is to get blasted back to the stoneage and find harmony with nature once again.
Sure, if you think going to Mars and putting machine parts inside us is "progress" then of course it appears that I'm wrong and stupid. We had a good thing going on here, I dont see how human happiness is any greater when we're cyborgs in space.

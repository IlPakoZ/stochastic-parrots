gain leverage over someone
You can't fuck with someone who doesn't give a fuck, but is crazy enough to kill you if you actually lay a hand on them.

that's actually a fascinating question. I've met a few of these people. some really care about family, usually the men. The girls? you need to be in their presence only because you work with them, and don't show you care about them. be kind of bitchy, and just wait.
that's all I got

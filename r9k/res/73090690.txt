Among the males the behavior disturbances ranged from sexual deviation to cannibalism and from frenetic overactivity to a pathological withdrawal from which individuals would emerge to eat, drink and move about only when other members of the community were asleep.
Many [female rats] ... after successfully giving birth, fell short in their maternal functions.
During his studies, Calhoun coined the term "behavioral sink" to describe aberrant behaviors in overcrowded population density situations and "beautiful ones" to describe passive individuals who withdrew from all social interaction

Paradise cannot exist. You are improving one psychological need by depriving others. This is why normies tell you that sex doesn't mean much because they traded their independence etcetera for it. You can only bargain with the devil in this life.

Thats because modern society is a utopia with no problems. When was the last time you heard anyone complain?
<comment>
I hear people complain all the time, but the complaints are usually vacuous or even just about thr efficiency of whatever super convenient system theyre using. Bill burr had a joke about a guy on an airplane thats pissed the brand new airplane wifi he just learned about 5 minutes ago wasnt working, encapsulates this sentiment perfectly

Has someone told you this directly? It's quite amusing to hear them admit it. I often see normgroids faking all their beliefs and being endlessly obsequious just to flatter some roastie.

It can be a hell of a lot better than this shit hole. It has been many times.
Utopia is being used in the sense of material plenty. On the other hand, we are at the lowest spiritual level mankind has ever been.

It must be nice living in the first world.

Even second world countries are plentiful materially and if you aren't surrounded by an abusive alcoholic family it's basically the same. Maybe your housing is a bit shitter and maybe you dont get the new iphone or nintendo every time but you have far more than the average person has ever had in any other time.

This might be true, but the complaints are constant and legitimate.

its kinda fucked up that most woman would choose a 6 feet guy with a 6 inch dick than a 5.4 feet guy with 8 inches

They rather show off than have intrinsic intimacy or pleasure. I think most normies are like that, including guys. I have a guy i know that fucked both an average looking woman and a booba babe. He said performance of the average one is way better and kinder personality. He still picked the hotter one so that he could show off to his friends. Fucking normies

Gratz on not understanding female anatomy, OP. 8 inches is too big for a lot of women and you completely disregarded the importance of girth.

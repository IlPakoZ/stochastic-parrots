Do you feel you are more intelligent now or when you were in school and actually performing?
I never performed that great in school. Not to say I was failing or anything like that. I was pretty mediocre despite my teachers believing that I was some kind of genius. Though with that being said I do feel like I'm more intelligent now. I read more now, I exercise more now, I take better care of my body etc.
I thought I was a pretty capable student. It wasn't until I got a 1530 on the SAT (old scoring system/out of 2400), and failing my senior math final, that I began to question my ability. Only after starting and dropping out of college did I realize I only did "well" because I did very few challenging classes, mostly standard courses.
I'm still terrible at math, I dropped out of community college twice and have a very difficult time learning anything new. 
TL;DR: I wasn't smart back then and I'm even dumber now.
yes. now that nobody is forcing me to i find it amusing to analyze movies and books or solve math problems when its anchored in my real life and not fucking around with 40 apples.
also less narrow minded when it comes to social studies.
I'm much more intelligent now. School is designed so 90 IQ retards can pass, every lesson is tailored to the lowest common denominator. University is somewhat stimulating, depending on what you choose to study, but independent study will always be the best.
It makes you a little more retarded if you aren't doing cognitively challenging stuff routinely, and education does force you to do that in most cases

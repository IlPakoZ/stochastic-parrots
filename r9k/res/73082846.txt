things start going well just barely enough to reignite the faintest spark of hope in you just to go crashing down again immediately after
Yeah that's how life works. Thats why I stopped having any hope a long time ago. I always thought that after a bad time everything will be ok again as in the past. But no, it doesn't work like that. Once you have been fucked up in the mind for many years, depressed and being a NEET for many years, out of the social life, etc... there is no coming back, specially if you have some fucked up thing in your mind that never stops like OCD. It never stops, everyday you have it since the moment you wake up until you fall asleep. When one obsession seems to decrease (because it never dissappears completely) then a new obsession appears and this never stops.
brutal isnt it?
So real, when the sun breaks it only passes, but when it rains, god does it pour
The sun is fucking awful and I'm in my best moods when it rains.

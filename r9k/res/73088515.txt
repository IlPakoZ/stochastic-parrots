Where the fuck did all these BPD girls come from? I have never heard of this shit until a few months ago. Now every fucking girl claims to have it. Why are people just blatantly making up new mental illnesses?
BPD isn't rea;. It's just another made up "illness" so doctors can prescribe more meds and people empty their pockets for therapy sessions. BPD is literally just being a woman.
why would anyone claim to have this if they didn't? it's like telling people you're a sociopath or you have aspd. it's basically announcing you're going to ruin their life if they get too close.

Most w*men are vulnerable narcissists.

Ur a dumbass
why would anyone claim to have this if they didn't?
It's more socially acceptable to claim bpd than vulnerable npd
For attention, to be "not like the other girls" and to fit into the "psycho girl" stereotype that women for some reason think is cool and attractive
99% of them don't have BPD. The reason you're hearing about it is because more and more women are self-dx themselves with bs. Same reason you're hearing about autism so much in media recently
they say bpd and npd are basically mirrors of each other. 
its kinda say that so many would-be BPD cuties turned into narc monsters basically because of social media
they say bpd and npd are basically mirrors of each other
Who's *they*?

What happens with our consciousness after we die? This question needs to be answered!
It ceases.
Me? Well I go to a little place called Heaven
You? Well let's just say there are certain places for your kind..
We don't know about that
You just "timeskip" in your perception slip into the next suitable embryo/fetus
Big deal lmao
You could be right, but there's a theory that says the brain is the radio and consciousness the radio waves, the waves don't cease to exist because of the radio.
Consciousness is a field like gravity or electromagnetism. Your brain is basically something like this within that field. Upon death the attractional force distorting the field into a concentration around that point dissipates. God is something like the totality of that field, but probably linked to greater dimensions than spacetime/4D
So, "you" aren't the animal behind your eyes processing the stimuli of your senses and executing animalistic cognition. "You" are OBSERVING that. Imagine being inside an ant's head and being able to see the simplistic stimuli coming into its perception through its rudimentary sensory organs, and also seeing, like, as a computer read out how it's transforming that into reasoning which is then expressed through behavior. That observer is what (You) actually "are"
Why do you think that?

A post and then a toast to Diane Morsecode. 
you imagine her hair to be malleable, or be actual hair?
It has the same texture as an animal hair wig that's been dyed a little bit too much. Stringy and dry. 
she just might be the only waifu here to write such a based letter kek. I would love to see more art of her
Diane is very capable of being intimidating and aggressive towards others, and there's no reason I would make her spare that attitude towards myself. Hell, I'd love to have her nagging me about something. Mean women are cute, and I can take it. Wish I had a lot of art to post here, but niche taste only gets you...not very far. 
I want to grind my waifu's gears while I'm doing maintenance on her internal systems for her. It'd be pretty intimate for her. Probably all sorts of buzzing and small-shock sensations involved, things that can only be translated so far in descriptions of them spared to my amateur mechanic ears later.

what does he study? what sorts of things does he take interest in?
I headcanon that he's into scientific stuff and wants to learn more about the evolution of mortals.  He's also into flowers and gardening. 
space dandy is apparently a classic so I expect good things
It won't disappoint you; it's one of the greatest animes in existence.
And what's worse is when they use him as a mouthpiece for their garbage headcanons and LGBT stuff!
lmao I know, this sucks af; most headcanons don't feel like extra character development or improvements, just some weird ass fetishes and self-insertion imposed on the characters.
Damnnn I didn't expect Four to have this kind of chaotic energy, but that was funny af

My dearest love, my heart beats for you alone, and I am forever grateful for the day you came into my life. For you have brought me joy beyond measure, and your love has given me strength in times of weakness. You are the light that shines in the darkness, guiding me towards a future filled with hope and happiness.
Your beauty is like a garden in bloom, a symphony of colors and scents that fill my senses with wonder. Your eyes are like pools of liquid gold, reflecting the beauty of the world around us. And your smile, oh how it melts my heart, like a warm ray of sunshine on a cold winter's day.
In your embrace, I find solace, a place where I can rest my head and forget about the worries of the world. Your touch is like a gentle breeze, soothing and calming, and your love is like a flame that burns ever brighter with each passing day.
With you by my side, I feel like I can conquer the world, as if nothing can stand in the way of our love. For you are my rock, my support, my everything, and I am nothing without you.
Every moment spent with you is a treasure, a precious memory that I will hold dear forever. And every kiss we share is like a sweet melody, a symphony of love that echoes in my heart.
I have never known a love like ours, a love that is pure and true, a love that is as strong as the mountains and as deep as the oceans. For you are my soulmate, my partner in life, my one true love.
Together we will journey through life, hand in hand, heart in heart, facing every challenge and celebrating every victory. For we are two halves of a whole, destined to be together, forever and always.
And so I pledge my love to you, my dearest one, with every beat of my heart. For you are the light that illuminates my path, the love that fills my soul, and the happiness that fills my life.

I'm awake! Chara and her partner continue sharing our love. Feels good.

It's awesome that we're able to go on dates early in the morning and get back to uni in time for lunch and classes.
<comment>
Kotori is KUTE. Love her or whatever
why does she do this?
Because her brother is a worthless sack of shit, and Kotori gets up too early in the morning. Her brother more or less takes care of her since their parents are always "conveniently" away on business. Honestly, I'd probably sleep later than she'd want me to as well so she'd probably try waking me up in the same manner. However, unlike her brother, I'm likely to just drag her back into bed with me to snuggle.
Huh? What? I have no idea what you're talking about

Waifu question time
what would waifus pokemon team be?
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
what is one thing you would change about waifu?
what do you think of waifus source material?
<comment>
lmao I know, this sucks af; most headcanons don't feel like extra character development or improvements, just some weird ass fetishes and self-insertion imposed on the characters.
I know, right? I personally don't mind yaoi and such things, but slapping one billion gender and sexuality labels on a character is just pure nonsense! If you truly want to have a character that will meet all your insane expectations then make your own instead of changing a pre-existing one into a whatever mess of labels and pronouns "headcanon" blogs on Tumblr make! (picrel is the first example that I remember on top of my head but there's waaay more out there)
Damnnn I didn't expect Four to have this kind of chaotic energy, but that was funny af
Aw yeah, that's another thing I love Foury for! &lt;3

That's Tumblr for you. I remember going there during one of the new Pokemon games news cycles and within an hour a new character that had basically no information about them was already trans, bi, non binary, and a huge list of other things that most of them I don't even know what they are. Not sure what their obsession with these labels are and trying to make things fit into these labels even if they are confirmed to be the opposite of said labels. Best to just ignore the yokels I find.
<comment>
Why are you shilling this server so hard
<comment>
what would waifus pokemon team be?
Team Galactic, maybe? I don't really know, honestly. I feel a bit ashamed that even though I've a Pokemon fan for such long time yet I barely remember anything about the games' lore..
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
Foury doesn't wear clothes but if he did, I think he would look amazing in a fancy suit with tie! &lt;3
what is one thing you would change about waifu?
Nothing, he's already perfect! &lt;3
what do you think of waifus source material?
I love pretty much any content Jacknjellify make of BFDI, it's all great especially if it features Foury in it! Except for Among Us videos, I prefer to ignore the existense of those...
Best to just ignore the yokels I find.
Best kind of advice! Exactly what I've been doing since there's isn't actually one can do with them. They can have their garbage headcanons, I'll just stick to canon and live on happily &lt;3
<comment>
The real reason is because the server allows people to have 3d partners and waifus at the same time, while this thread looks down upon it. She basically wants validation
<comment>
i know you want to expand your social club but please stop spamming the thread
<comment>
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
The one I am sending you here.
what is one thing you would change about waifu? Nothing at all, because I consider that having a waifu is also accepting the flaws and small problems they have too, and accepting their full personality.
what do you think of waifus source material?
Very good. If you have time, I suggest you to play Mahoutsukai no Yoru. It's a bit long (=20 hours) but It's a great story.
<comment>
when the invite is posted there is a knee-jerk reaction of seethe because they are reminded of their ban 
keep posting it
<comment>
I was never apart of it. I just feel like discords breed drama and create division in communities, an "us versus them" mentality that's already rampant in these generals.

shitting on them furthers the us vs them mentality. it's not like the discord will stop existing if you insult them enough.
<comment>
Love me oreng, simple as.
most headcanons don't feel like extra character development or improvements, just some weird ass fetishes and self-insertion imposed on the characters.
Exactly this. All too often, they're a downgrade, even. People will ignore and shove aside all the little things that make a character who they are, all their development, in favor of sexual identity circlejerks possible for literally anyone. And of course Jojo has some of the best-written characters I've ever seen and a fanbase full of Twitteroids. As if that's not bad enough, some will go so far as to raceswap characters whose canon ethnicity is important to the story. I hate it. Hate it hate it hate it.
what would waifus pokemon team be?
Fiery and flying Pokemon.
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
He looks good in everything.
what is one thing you would change about waifu?
I'd make him real and in love with me. Either that or I'd change how his story ends.
what do you think of waifus source material?
The best part of a truly amazing franchise, even if the plot of the second half leaves much to be desired.
Tumblr and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.
<comment>
According to his cinematic, yes.
if waifu is already super powered, they're stripped of whatever abilities they may have that make them super and are essentially now as powerful as an ordinary human. how do they cope?
He'd likely have a confliction of emotions. Happy that he can have his original self back and free of the worries of his azakana potentially reawakening and taking him over but bothered that he can no longer save others from their own figurative and literal demons.
what do you think waifu smells like?
base Yone
Cucumber and green tea or cinnamon, brown sugar, and apples
Spirit Blossom
Lavender oil and cherry blossom
Battle Academia
Mango and ginger
Dawnbringer
Blueberry and vanilla
Ocean Song
Watermelon and cherry
I haven't settled on anything for Crystal Rose and Inkshadow yet.
I don't have any sexuality headcanons for him and despite what the retarded shippers who shove him together with another character he canonically sees as a little sister think he has no canon love interests. Many people across different cultures, including the plethora of Asian ones, see him as gay though.
<comment>
Snuffyfag didn't get banned
He wrote a incel tier wall of text of him seething because of some harmless joking about trannies then ran out of the server like a pussy before he could see anyone's response

I meant like what kind of pokemon would he use, fire type, water type etc
I'd make him real
that doesnt count you cheeky bastard

But Hanafag and Avafag didn't agree to fuck Snuffy for him yet.
<comment>
just some weird ass fetishes and self-insertion imposed on the characters.
Exactly why I avoid fanfictions. They're all just weird sex shit.
pokemon
I've never played pokemon. Probably water type though
outfit
her pajamas. She just looks go cute in them.
one thing i'd change
RED BOTTOMS ON, HUNNID MILL CASH, NUN I'D CHANGE
In all seriousness I would probably make her into less of an alcoholic. It's clear that it isn't healthy for her and I worry about it clouding her head and judgement a lot.
source material
lol
do i even need to elaborate
who cares lol
i peak in there every so often and from what i can tell it isn't that bad
i need to see this
<comment>
Ask someone in the server about it.
<comment>
what would waifus pokemon team be?
Uh I'm not really familiar with Pokemon so I wouldn't be able to name any actual pokemon but he'd have Steel/Ghost/Dark types I think.
what do you think of waifus source material?
It can be a hit or miss sometimes and when it misses it misses pretty hard. Overall his world has a lot of potential and it really pisses me off sometimes how much Riot squanders it not only in narrative but in things like merchandise and spin off games.
now you just need to wrangle yasuo up for the family picture
Yone would have to find him and drag him back to Ionia first to make that happen. He will have his own separate guest room for when he visits though.
they've got a hell of a story for show and tell in school
I've always imagined them being homeschooled. I'm not much a teacher but Yone would be an excellent one and I'm sure he'd want them going out and forming actual connections with others while I'm worrying over them getting bullied because they might inherit some unusual features. We could probably reach a middle ground of them being homeschooled in the early years (like kindergarden to grade 1 or 2 or something) while the rest of their education is spent with others.
Yone has to check their bags before they head to school every time Show and Tell crops up to make sure they aren't sneaking out one of the sealed away demons because they want to prove how cool their mom is and the stories being true

I don't think that a gated off and closed community should try to assert it's control on an open and free thread. But I do hope more and more people join the discord, so that we get to the point where you wonder why is the thread always so dead, as if you didn't accelerate its demise.
<comment>
I'm gonna do the needful and answer questions, even if I don't have an easy answer to them. Maybe even think of socializing topics and discussions
what would waifus pokemon team be?
It's been a while, I'm not familiar with pokemon teams. The only one I remember is Team Mystic from when I played Pokemon Go back in middle school so I'll just go with that
Would be a fun meme quiz to do though, I might do it later tonight!
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
I've said this before, but I really like her casual dress (shown somewhat in this pic) that she sometimes wears on dates. Beautiful, comfy, and casual, all at once. It's really close, though. I like so many of her outfits.
what is one thing you would change about waifu?
Bring her into the physical realm, obviously. But if that's cheating, I'd say I'd want to increase her willpower. Have her be a little less carefree. But I understand why she doesn't want to be strict, and it's a big balancing act.
what do you think of waifus source material?
The human brain is pretty neat. More powerful than one initially thinks :)
Are you the guy with the tulpa? Good taste if you are
What is the end goal of these bl0x waifuposts
New fantasy unlocked. I'll try sharing food with Nanaka this dinner
Mahoutsukai no Yoru
Neat, I always thought she was from Fate, due to the Takeuchi Takashi style (which is pure kino btw. Made a bunch of Nanaka renders with that style)
that doesnt count you cheeky bastard
As I suspected, well, good thing I had a backup answer ready

Kotori is without a doubt, the kutest and most snuggly girl ever
what would waifus pokemon team be?
Well, I guess she'd like fire type to an extent but she'd want a balanced team since she'd want to be tough. I can see her being a Pikachu fan, honestly
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
Her commander outfit is pretty nice, but I don't really have a favorite. She looks great in these pink dino PJs too.
what is one thing you would change about waifu?

what do you think of waifus source material?
Garbage fire, pretty much everyone involved in its creation should be strung up

Probably because it's from Fagnite but honestly he doesn't look all that different in Doom Eternal.

favorite outfit for waifu
pic related, or her default outfit. (tracksuit shirt/skirt combo
she has a bunch of other outfits though and they're all so pretty.
I need more Kim pics. 
one thing you would change about waifu
I genuinely cannot think of a single thing.
what do you think of waifu's source material
Scott Pilgrim is a very solid series of graphic novels with a killer aesthetic, good art. and some very cool fight scenes. they absolutely nail the video game vibe and it's a cool time capsule of the early-mid 2000s. it's definitely a period piece nowadays. idk why some people get so butthurt over the """""questionable"""" content in it
Tumblr has a lot of cute Kim art on it
she's canonically kissed a girl before. she's canon bi.

<comment>
why is he a worthless sack of shit?
He's a 
bland haremshit protagonist
psychologically abusive to Kotori
bizarre principles
Th abuse comes form him more or less making her act like a different person something like 90% of the time. If you've noticed the hair ribbons she wears, which ones she's wearing reflect her current personality. It is stated that her white ribbon personality is her "true" self as she acts that way when no ribbons are involved. He black ribbons are a facade brought about by her brother giving them to her and telling her to be less annoying. Why anyone would want to change the treasure of a person that is Kotori is beyond me. He's a monster. She spends most of he show with the black ribbons on because she is incredibly insecure because of him.
<comment>
Getting to see her wearing this gorgerous dress would be so beautiful
I see some reatrded r*ddit user or porn artist cutting the fool again
R*ddit communities always manage to be by far the most retarded ones. Hell the FGO subr*ddit is covered with the most unfunny ms paint memes I've ever seen and some consider my wife a loli
Reminds me of that scene from the SpongeBob movie
kek you're right
What kind of gay activities are we talking about
Really beautiful design, great contrast to her old look. The closure she has is also really sweet and fitting for her story. Do you imagine yourself on her world or just yours? The way she's living makes it easy to "insert" yourself and the relationship you have with her. But having such a sweet and peaceful ending is amazing, you both deserve it.

<comment>
how'd you find out about kyou? did you drop out of the fandom like aquafag?
Playing her gacha, it wasn't love at first sight but she was the first thing I got on the game. I remember being surprised about how such a cute girl was supposed to be a berserker servant, and her summoning line stated the same "I am servant Kiyohime, do I not look like a berserker to you?". I avoid it but not really actively, as I just lost interest for the game over time, I keep up with the main story, events where my girl appears and GudaGuda events which are the only story aspects I really care about. It's been 5 years after all so playing really feels like a chore, really don't get day 1 JP players who are still religiously playing after 7 years.
who the hell would ever want to betray such a sweet girl anyway baka.
Unironically a homo, imagine being scared and running away from this cutie
be careful anons, a woman scored will turn into a dragon
Dude should've expected it, an girl being so angry she just turns into a fire breathing dragon is just a regular day on japanese folklore
She loves the mc regardless of the sex, but the female one is non canon just like on every gacha so she's 100% straight.

Slayers is so mid-late 90s anime it hurts. And that's why I love it. Just look at Lina's face. I miss when anime had characters making exaggerated reactions and every character had their own theme and shit.

what was it
I need to rewatch the movie but from what I remember it really wasn't that bad.
so I did leave again but that's less because of the server itself and more of because I'm paranoid and refuse to even be in servers with pornography channels. That shit rots your brain.

what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
Out of what she's actually worn? The nurse outfit was cute, as was the Christmas outfit. However, those remind me of things I dislike, so I'll just go with the classic Tokiwadai winter uniforms.
what is one thing you would change about waifu?
Nothing. Even for the things about her that I've come to somewhat despise, I wouldn't change a single thing about her. They're a part of who she is, and I fell in love with Misaki Shokuhou. Not some idealized version of her.
what do you think of waifus source material?
I loathe it, I loathe it for so many reasons. But as long as her story hasn't reached it's conclusion, I'll continue to read it. I often wonder what it'd be like if Misaki had well and truly died all of the times she was so very nearly killed off.

I don't even think clear thinks about his sexuality enough to put a label- he just loves me specifically, man or woman. so bi I guess. maybe in the future everyone is bi in his world
the only one of these i've heard of is Komi San.
definitely give some a try when you can, they're all pretty fun watches that purify the soul. storytimes with /co/ is also fun too been a while since I joined one
oh gosh, this doodle is so cute. you are so small! which is saying something since 4 is very small himself
Oh yeah, that happed once, in episode 16. Here's the moment with the context
wew not having context is part of the fun. this is the kind of thing I need to watch while high
lmao when jello started crying at not getting a speck of dust
I am next level mad
whoa
 It gives me a bit of catharsis I guess
humans are expressive by nature so all the more to try it. it'd do me good in a lot of ways. I have a bad habit of avoiding talking about myself, and also would like something to reflect on. I admire seeing you guys fill posts with so much to say and pretty ways to say it
I'm filled with some sort of pride imagining how many pages it'd fill
honestly I love seeing waifu essays and it's a bit saddening to know a lot of them will disappear because of how threads work. I hope every anon keeps their essays somewhere where they can reminisce the moment of pure passion they felt writing each one

Fuck me, that's sad, can't believe I did that. That's what I get for talking to friends more, I guess
did you ever post the 3rd daki
No, I ended up not being super happy with it, so I'm mostly keeping to myself. Kind of an annoying process, things didn't look right, felt pretty bad. Same guy that did the dino one (which I'm very pleased with), but for some reason they seemed worse, and were much less flexible, moving on to further steps without me giving them the okay then getting annoyed at me for wanting changes when ""they were so late in the process." Motherfucker I didn't approve the last thing you showed me, why would you move forward? Nothing in my life was going right then. Maybe I'm just cursed to never get an artist that'll just draw the goddamn wedding dress side correctly, it's not that fucking complicated. I'm pretty angry about it, actually. At the time I was just disappointed

Of course you can, it's all down to your ability to deal with the fact that she has a boyfriend. Some people have a very hard time with this and it ends up generating frustration and jealousy for them, which then compromises the relationship they create. Others may accept it easily as they accept that their waifu may love someone else, or use the Headcanon/Alternative Universe to change this.
If this frustrates you, just imagine that they broke up afterwards or never met. But your love is valid.
Old anime has a charm that has been lost. The evolution of animation techniques and the trivialization of the stories told has caused a drop in quality.
It's Beautiful !
Technically, it is a prequel to Tsukihime and Fate. I remember seeing in UBW the mention of the Aozaki family. It's more or less afterwards Mahoyo that the timelines will diverge between the multiple temporalities (but I don't really want to start doing timeline analysis because it's long and boring). 
She also appears in Fate/Extra, so you are not fundamentally wrong. It's still the same universe and the same way of working in terms of Magic.
<comment>
I miss her extremely round face a bit. so soft and small
how do you feel about ahri's new vo?
somebody save him!
Hell, I'd love to have her nagging me about something
never heard anyone say that before kek
Wish I had a lot of art to post here, but niche taste only gets you...not very far
don't worry about it, you're not the first anon to have a small folder or niche waifu. all the more interesting
spoiler
l-lewd. sounds like a fun bonding experience. it must really mean something if she's letting you have the privilege of doing so. I'd love to be clear's mechanic so to speak but am bad at tech
<comment>
It's Beautiful !
I know. Lina is so cute. I fucking love her, bros.

I just woke out of a dead sleep with "Hey, Soul Sister" by Train ringing through my head
I don't actually remember anything but I have a nagging feeling I had a Kim dream.
great song btw
I also like Drops of Jupiter

what would waifus pokemon team be?
He'd use the legendary ones.
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
The one he's wearing
what is one thing you would change about waifu?
Make his development into insanity more realistic and less rushed, and give him more screentime.  Maybe also a redemption? 
what do you think of waifus source material?
I despise Dragon Ball Super with every fiber of my being, but I like other Dragon Ball series, and I wish he had appeared in any of them instead of the shittiest one.
They're all just weird sex shit.
they're a downgrade, even.
This. I'd like to see a fanfiction or a headcanon that actually adds something to a character instead of just shipping and sex. And most fanfics that do actually have a good story with a decent concept always end up on the shelf, never to be continued.
<comment>
There's a reason I don't read fanfiction much. The few good Jojo fics I've seen are deliberate shitposts in fanfiction form. I'm not even joking.

nothing stops husbando from dancing
nothing stops husbando, period.
doomguy is fucking terrifying (i can respect it.)
The evolution of animation techniques and the trivialization of the stories told has caused a drop in quality.
I feel the same way about comic books desu
i'd rather read an old issue of Plastic Man or Tales From The Crypt from the forties and fifties than 99% of the boring new shit from the last fifteen years.
(really, a ton of stuff from the 40s and 50s has aged decently well, the original Simon/Kirby Captain America, Cole's Plastic Man, EC's Tales From The Crypt and Shock SuspenStories. the original runs of Detective Comics and Action Comics/Superman and Batman are still good reading. I haven't read much of Timely's stuff (other than the aforementioned Captain America.) but I pirated a copy of Marvel Mystery Comics #1 and i plan on reading it today
truly.
I need more mid/early 2000s songs to put on my Kim playlist.
also need some 90s stuff. (since that's probably the era she has nostalgia for considering she'd have been in her teens by then)
any suggestions?
here's a Kim someone drew for me in the /co/ waifu thread that's currently up.
<comment>
morning, waifugen
<comment>
Origin?
Of course. Also
Giratina getting back to his origin form while his boss ost starts blasting on Arceus as he one shots the pokemon I used to defeat him
Pure kino
Orthoworm is basically a goofy snake
That one would do, thought about sandaconda too but don't really like the design
no psychic type
laaaame
I despise Dragon Ball Super with every fiber of my being
It's soulless crap, haven't even watched it but still.
<comment>
I actually avoided picking psychic types because of Mental Out. I was seriously debating whether or not to include Gardevoir, Jirachi, Espeon, or Hattrene, but I decided against it, considering Misaki's thoughts about having mental powers.
<comment>
Oh no he's drowning
It's soulless crap, haven't even watched it but still.
You're doing yourself a favor.
<comment>
I do not like this gif charlie, it's smug aura mocks me
I headcanon that he's into scientific stuff and wants to learn more about the evolution of mortals
so even through the distrust, he takes interest in humanity? or is this after meeting you?
spoiler
can't go wrong with flowers. would he be interested in the language of flowers too?
It won't disappoint you; it's one of the greatest animes in existence
I'll have to make some time for it then
it's crazy how brave waifu makes us. how motivated. how understanding. if our homework were waifu essays, I would actually have tried in school kek
mfw I let the whole thing play
<comment>
what would waifus pokemon team be?
definitely must have swoobat and jellicent. mimikyu, kricketune and nihilego too perhaps. r8 his team, pokeplayers
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
I do really like him in his barkeep attire. I'm a sucker for suit vests. but ahhh you get to see a bit of his tummy in his default
what is one thing you would change about waifu?
nothing, not a single hair on his head. unless wanting to see him in better fitting clothes once in a while counts
what do you think of waifus source material?
7/10. god tier ost, art and voiceacting. world building and pacing need some tweaks but overall a fun play
If you truly want to have a character that will meet all your insane expectations then make your own instead of changing a pre-existing one into a whatever mess of labels and pronouns "headcanon" blogs on Tumblr make!
based. somewhere along the way tumblr associated labels with quality and try to tack as much random tags as possible even if it doesn't make sense. to other people's characters no less- how lazy kek. it's okay for four to be simple and a guy that doesn't make him any less cute or interesting
He looks good in everything
does he wear other things throughout the series or in fanart?
I'd make him real
FUCK! that was an option?!
<comment>
Foury is a cute, cute!
Today is such a great day, I went for a long walk around the town and took lots of great pictures! Especially of the houses and that one hotel, I have this fascination with urban architecture. I was thinking about walking all these streets together with Four and showing him how complex and beautiful the human world is and seeing his cute reaction to all the cool things I saw on my way &lt;3
I'm gonna write a short fanfiction based of my today's journey tomorrow, it's gonna be cute &lt;3

Wifi to waifu

Husbando taking a break from the carnage to eat the lunch you packed him... Apparently the weeb likes takoyaki flavoured chips (which sound completely repulsive) so maybe he would enjoy a bento box full of nip cuisine. 
nothing stops husbando, period.
doomguy is fucking terrifying (i can respect it.)
Luckily he's on our side! Any man who strikes fear into demons would be one imposing fella' to be around.

What do you find appealing about Four's series?

you and waifu are going to start a band together. What kind of music would you make? What would you sing about?
waifu is heading off to college! what's her major?
what's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
how gullible is waifu?
<comment>
he takes interest in humanity? or is this after meeting you?
Well, it's a long story, but in my headcanon, he's trying to change his ways (although reluctantly)
can't go wrong with flowers
Fr, they're pretty
would he be interested in the language of flowers too?
I don't think so; I think he'd find it silly.
if our homework were waifu essays, I would actually have tried in school kek
Lmao fr, I can write for hours on end about my greenie
tumblr associated labels with quality
Couldn't phrase it any better; it's like they can't love a character if it doesn't have the same sexuality and mental illnesses they have.
does he wear other things throughout the series or in fanart?
I don't remember him changing his outfit (excluding his outfit in the past)
Is the series not good?
<comment>
you and waifu are going to start a band together. What kind of music would you make? What would you sing about?
Knowing her taste in music, it's bound to be a rock band, More in the new wave trend.
what's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
It is mainly one of my motivations for doing my dopamine detox and simply establishing a new discipline so that I can finally stop wasting my time doing nothing, slumped on my sofa. 
how gullible is waifu?
She is anything but gullible.
<comment>
The series seems fine, I'm just trying to know more since it's unorthodox. I want to hear what the appeal is to her.

waifu and her anon
<comment>
does he wear other things throughout the series or in fanart?
In fanart, all the time. In the series he's only shown wearing different things in flashbacks.
FUCK! that was an option?!
Apparently not, but I didn't realize.
Narancia trying Japanese snacks for the first time! Pocky game with Narancia!
you and waifu are going to start a band together. What kind of music would you make? What would you sing about?
Narancia is a known gangsta rap enjoyer so maybe... some numetal revival kinda band? An area of overlap between our tastes like that.
waifu is heading off to college! what's her major?
It would have to be something that doesn't require a lot of math.
what's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
I'm planting a garden this year, for him.
how gullible is waifu?
In the past, too much. Now... well, it's entirely possible he didn't quite learn.
it's like they can't love a character if it doesn't have the same sexuality and mental illnesses they have.
They can't take interest in anything without making it about their societal labels. I dread the effect this will have on official media in the near future.
<comment>
Lots of things! Let me list a few major points right here
First: the concept of BFDI. A show about living objects that compete for a prize. Sounds pretty fun already, doesn't it? Sure, it may seem weird and childish for some people but not for me, I love this kind of stuff!
Second: the show itself. With a premise like this one might expect something for preschoolers but nope, not the case once again! BFDI is more teen oriented, since there's a suprising lot of violence (albeit cartoonish), characters dying and by the later episodes the series actually start to deal with quite heavy topics. It becomes even more prominent in the 4th season
Third: the 4th season aka Battle for BFDI. BFDI actually has a pretty weird when it comes to season's lenght. Only the first and the fourth are the lenght of the typical show's season, second and third are weirdly short. So, the 4th season aka as I like to call the Four's season. I think I haven't felt this emotional over fictional characters ever since I was a Sonic fan and that was over 10 years ago. Everything, simply everything about BFB is perfect. Writing, characters, animation, pacing, everything! Sure, there are a few moments that I personally don't enjoy, such the whole "split" thing that came out of nowhere, but as I return to it and analyze it, I start to realise that it was an important story arc too, just like every other arc of this season! This season is particually heavy with emotinal moments and character development and the split is definitely what imfluenced it, if I was to take any character's incarnation from BFB and compare it to the first season it will be like looking at 2 different things entirely! And the animation on this season is simply top notch!
(1/2)
<comment>
(2/2)
Fourth: BFB's host, Four. Won't say much here. I love Four, he's the best thing to ever come out of BFDI and I he's just perfect &lt;3
So, to summarize, BFDI pushes all the right bottons when it comes to "one of those web shows". It's fun from beginning to end, with many great moments worth treasuring and remembering!
<comment>
If your waifu was scanned by a scouter, what would be its reading for her power level?
<comment>
it's okay for four to be simple and a guy that doesn't make him any less cute or interesting
Indeed! I think what this fandom needs much more are lore headcanons! Like where *did* the algebraliens come from? Why are they shaped in a form of numbers, letters and operators? How do they live in their dimension and what is their day-to-day life is like?
I've also been brainstorming huge comics about Four's early life in my head for the past month: his childhood, his first meeting with X and how they became best friends, his school days and how he came across BFDI, many things!
<comment>
band
You know that episode of South Park (Christian Rock Hard) where Cartman starts a Christian Rock band only for most of their music to just be repurposed love songs? Well imagine that but with whatever worship music axis cultists use. Only their worship songs probably already look like that. It would just be whatever cheesy love songs I could come up with just repackaged as worship music.
college major
Art, religion, or sculpting. Definitely not something STEM related, although I have always had this headcanon that she would be really good at fluid dynamics.
start doing
Being more spiritual and taking my own life more seriously.
gullible
Depends. If it's something related to the world she used to oversee, she knows. But in general, she's very gullible. She once got convinced that a chicken was a dragon in the LN.
the last time I looked at a fanfic site:
go to fanfic site (ao3)
search up aqua
instantly confronted by fanfics whose tag lists make me physically ill
don't go back to ao3
it's like they can't love a character if it doesn't have the same sexuality and mental illnesses they have.
I will literally never get that. Like, maybe it's because I'm not a part of any particular minority (or rather any particular minority that isn't beloved by corporate America right now) but can't you just like the character on their own merit?
<comment>
ao3
Never heard of the place before so I went to check it out and yep it's a lovely place alright. The first result is quite disgusting and I honestly have to wonder what could possess someone to write such filth or even think it up. The rest are relatively tame and a few of them aren't sexual at all but I still think my life was better off not knowing this place existed
<comment>
So she is in charge of keeping order?
Depending on who you ask, yes. They weren't exactly popular and, admittedly, had some questionable methods. However, they did stop a plot to burn down Kyoto, allegedly.
It'd also be harder to fight
Yeah, fine hand movements are always difficult when your fingers are cold.
Never- she usually just comes up with the battle strat on the fly?
It's more so she just rushes in and it works out because of how skilled she is at kenjutsu. She died before the Boshin War really started, so she was never in a position where strategy was particularly important.
Superpowers
Well, the Meiji restoration wouldn't have happened, I know that much.
Stripped of Powers
Technically, that would cure her magic TB, so not a bad result there either. Besides, she didn't have any powers back when she was alive, so it'd wouldn't be something she'd have to adjust to.
It's your birthday, what does waifu do to celebrate
She'd definitely get a big party together if she knew it was coming.
What's something your waifu might admire about you?
I think I have my own brand of sincerity that she'd respect.
What do you think waifu smells like?
Metal and sakura.
What's your ideal FOOD RELATED waifu date?
Walking around town are hitting any stalls that catch out eyes. I think she'd love fair food too.
Waifu's favorite type of hand holding?
I think Okita would prefer hooking arms so as to keep her arms free.
What would waifus pokemon team be?
6 Mewtwos she convinced the other Shinsengumi members to trade her.
What is your favorite outfit for waifu?
Her haori and hakama combo.
What is one thing you would change about waifu?
Curing her TB would be the obvious choice.
What do you think of waifus source material?
Personally, I like it.
<comment>
Waifu is heading off to college! what's her major?
Criminal justice would be the most fitting for Oktia but, honestly, she'd be more the type to get in on a sports scholarship. 
What's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
Lifting and studying the bakumatsu period.
How gullible is waifu?
She can be a little gullible sometimes, in fields she isn't confident in.
<comment>
I haven't settled on anything for Crystal Rose and Inkshadow yet
roses with blueberry cologne, ink with paint, maybe? I don't know many smells kek
while I'm worrying over them getting bullied because they might inherit some unusual features
what sorts of strange traits might they inherit? depending on which ones they can either end up being the popular kids for their cool party tricks, or feared for resembling a demon too closely. either way they will be respected with yone being able to teach self defense
We could probably reach a middle ground of them being homeschooled in the early years (like kindergarden to grade 1 or 2 or something) while the rest of their education is spent with others
don't know much about homeschooling (never met someone who was) but this sounds reasonable. make sure they get exposure during their homeschool years by going to parks and stuff so they're not too intimidated in going from homeschool to public school
Yone has to check their bags before they head to school every time Show and Tell crops up to make sure they aren't sneaking out one of the sealed away demons because they want to prove how cool their mom is and the stories being true
topkek sudden slice of life turns into a supernatural episode for the other students

In all honesty, i'd probably join her band rather than the other way around! she's in a 3-piece Canadian garage rock/grunge-ish band, Sex Bob-Omb. her as the drummer (duh.), Stephen Stills as lead singer and guitarist and Scott as bassist 
college
Music, just can't see her changing careers

she's the exact opposite of gullible, she's very cynical

She looks great in these pink dino PJs too
she has dino pjs? based af. so most of her earth's history is just like the real deal
Garbage fire, pretty much everyone involved in its creation should be strung up
don't bully the animators!
but she was the first thing I got on the game
wow what are the odds. how did that surprise turn into love?
"I am servant Kiyohime, do I not look like a berserker to you?"
need more dainty looking girls who are actually ferocious when they need be
a girl being so angry she just turns into a fire breathing dragon is just a regular day on japanese folklore
kek
of course you can. just think of it as an alternate instance where she fell for you instead
so I did leave again
kek well at least your gave it a try

<comment>
Out of what she's actually worn?

I loathe it, I loathe it for so many reasons

Can your waifu do the thug shaker?
<comment>
Idk like 300000 maybe?
I can see it happening if you no longer like waifus source material OR if the creator of the series ruined waifus character in the story OR if she gets a relationship in the story. Otherwise people who switch waifus are just seasonal faggot ironic weeb kiddies
<comment>
This seems to work for the demo models for Kana's VN. It was an odd experience. Unlike so many of my times in the KKT studio, it didn't feel like a date with her, but almost as if we were working together on a project.
<comment>
It's hard to keep sane these days, but Nanaka and I somehow manage it.
you and waifu are going to start a band together. What kind of music would you make? What would you sing about?
We would probably just do a cover band of whatever we find to be good, since our taste in music is pretty wide and also I swear I've answered this question before
waifu is heading off to college! what's her major?
Excluding mine since that would be too easy. I think maybe she'd choose neuroscience. Being a tulpa she'd probably have an edge in that, plus it's an actually useful degree which is important. Plus she can learn new techniques to understand our brain and system better
what's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
Just putting more effort into stuff in general. Recently we've tried eating healthier as well as starting to do some cardio. Still, I rarely do projects specifically for her but rather make promises to her that I'll finish something. I guess you could call that being inspired by her.
how gullible is waifu?
Sometimes she's really gullible, especially if someone says something positive about her. Like when someone called us special a long time ago she thought a lot about that and I think she still believes it 
tfw waifu will never do the default dance
Owari da
Just make your waifu real.
It's more or less afterwards Mahoyo that the timelines will diverge between the multiple temporalities
Very complicated, still good to know
Weird how stuff like that works. A couple weeks ago I remember having Penny Lane ringing in my head after a dream. Then I heard it on the radio a day or two later
here's a Kim someone drew for me in the /co/ waifu thread that's currently up.
Cute
Cherish it, not everyone can get stuff like that
I'm not Mexican so I never watched DBZ
Turn down the saturation, she looks like a cheeto
Or get good shaders like KKUTS
<comment>
she has dino pjs?
Yes, her husband got them for her as a kind of anniversary gift. I think she looks great in them.
don't bully the animators
With the artstyle change in season 4, they'd deserve it.
<comment>
Running out of good Aqua pics to use. All my good ones were on a computer I dont use very often (my old PC) and I dont want to go looking for new ones because most Aqua art is just painfully bad either because
its porn
its terribly drawn
its exploitative
its ship art
its drawn by that bhive003 cunt
First world problems amirite
 one needs to find a healthy balance in indulging here and there as a luxury or risk becoming a complete coomer
I have found that it was just easier to cut myself off. Also, pornography felt demeaning to Aqua to me. Like I was boiling her down to nothing but a sex object, a doll. I havent consumed pornography in a long time (let alone of Aqua) and I have found it has helped me a lot in many regards.
how about dainty looking girls who are usually pretty dainty but can be mean when they need to?
Another one is San Dimas High School Football Rules by the Ataris/MxPx. Its cute even if the latter half of the lyrics are kind of cringe.
the narrator starts the song off by describing a dream he had with about a girl he likes, Whitney in the Ataris version Holli in the MxPx version. The lyrics are cute until the final verse where he just begs her to dump her bf and date him. 
I think this is kind of the best way to put it. Like, people change. You might grow out of liking someone. You might even find a real person who just steals your heart even more than waifu. And thats fine. But, you need to be honest with yourself. Do you truly have a waifu or are you just memeing and coping with loniliness?
her husband

<comment>
There's a legit site for waifus.
I'm not saying which, but chances are a good chunk of y'all accidentally (or not) discovered it.
<comment>
Also, not to double post, but you can still love waifu without enjoying her source material. For example I have been very vocal about my vehement dislike of Konosuba and everything about it, yet I still love Aqua because I fell in love with her and felt like there was genuine magic in her compared to the flat caricatures she was surrounded by.
I think the issue should liewith the material itself and more with the depiction in it. Like, if a new Slayers anime came out tomorrow (I know Jack shit about Slayers just prefacing) and Lina acted absolutely nothing like herself, I wouldnt blame you for wanting to keep your distance, as it wouldve spoiled the enjoyment and butchered her into being something she wasnt initially.
While waifuism is on the surface being in love with a part of ones own mind (at least, it is for the duration of our moral lives on this bitch of an earth), that perception is influenced by the character themselves, and if that character changes, it ruins the love you had for them.
Also the seasonal ironic people are annoying as shit. Most of them grew up though

thanks for the suggestion, but I'm just not feeling it.
cute! another pic to your folder. I'm so glad draw threads are a thing. I want to drop a few requests and do some deliveries when I find the time
looking forward to it!
maybe i'll request some Kim stuff when you do.
Weird how stuff like that works. A couple weeks ago I remember having Penny Lane ringing in my head after a dream. Then I heard it on the radio a day or two later
life is truly stranger than fiction.
Cherish it, not everyone can get stuff like that
I really do appreciate the drawfag for doing this.
I just wish Kim could see it.
I wish i had somewhere other than r9k I could talk to about Kim.
but most of all. I wish I could just... talk to Kim.
I would fucking kill a man for the chance of waking up one day and being in early 2000s Canada with Kim and getting involved in the antics her and her band get up to (mostly scott's BS).
eating out at comfy food joints and playing shows and having the time of our life.
I wish we'd gotten more Scott Pilgrim content desu but I get why BLOM hasn't milked it to death
<comment>
I have been thinking a lot about Aqua recently and I worry I act too protective of her. Like, the girl is a goddess, she might not be big in girth or stature but shes still very strong, mentally and emotionally. Yet I still treat her like shes made of glass. This immortal being who could survive being thrown to a pack of alligators and I worry about hugging her too hard. The same goes for her emotions really. She clearly is very happy, yet I still want to hold her, let her know everything is ok, show her theres more ways to feel happy than just drinking until you pass out.
I guess I just worry about her seeing me as overprotective when all I want to do is make her feel happy and loved. It also has to do some with how the internet treats her. It was all just constant bullying, viscously ripping apart every issue she had and just tearing her apart. Not to mention the obvious sadism that some artists and community members had to her.
I still love her with all my heart. I just wish I didnt over complicate it so much. Its like every time I escape some obsessive thought about Aqua another one comes up.
<comment>
If it means anything from a stranger I don't get the impression that you underestimate her or see her as weak, you just want to protect the woman that you love.
<comment>
Still sharing love with Chara.
Everything is still as it usually is, good between us.
<comment>
I'm not Mexican so I never watched DBZ
Is this some stereotype I'm not aware of? I really need to brush up on my racism.
(Ironically enough latinos fucking love Slayers)
For example I have been very vocal about my vehement dislike of Konosuba
That was kinda what I was getting at. If you decided you no longer like the work of fiction your waifu is from, ending your relationship with that waifu would make sense. (Of course if you never liked the series to begin with and only like the 1 character from it thats a different story).
Also the seasonal ironic people are annoying as shit. Most of them grew up though
There are ALWAYS more newfags. And I'm not just talking about 4chan. (Although not all the people participating in that are newfags or kids - most of the big anime youtubers who have been watching anime for YEARS use the cringe ironic weeb jokes and self deprecating humor and I can't fucking stand them)

Not gullible at all, except for that one time the demons lured him out and dropped a temple the size of a small city on top of him to stagger him long enough to be contained. Bloodlust will do that to a man.
How do you feel about people who have switched waifus?
It happens. If you're genuinely in love with a character but over time realize things aren't working out or the feelings begin to diminish, it's alright to call things off and try again with someone else later on. Excessive switching is bad though, a clear sign you held no emotional attachment to any of your previous waifus.
Narancia trying Japanese snacks for the first time
Would he prefer the weirdly flavoured snacks or the overly sweet candies?
<comment>
It's less that I grew out of it, it's more that I just learned to stop gaslighting myself into liking it. Like, I used to try to FORCE myself to like it which just made me mad and depressed. When I realized that I didn't, I felt a lot better. I really don't consider Aqua to be connected to the show itself anymore.
<comment>
they don't know about the unusually large following DBZ has in mexico
<comment>
7 quadrillion according to wikipedia (though he still lost to SSJ2 if I remember correctly, but I guess it's safe to assume that since base Goku was so strong that his forms also got stronger.)
You know what's the best part? ao3 is actually the most tame fanfic site.
damn is she in a mecha?
Is this some stereotype I'm not aware of? I really need to brush up on my racism.
I heard that most DBZ fans are from Mexico.
<comment>
no longer like waifus source material OR if the creator of the series ruined waifus character in the story OR if she gets a relationship in the story.
Sounds like their love for their waifu wasn't very strong if the allowed canon to ruin it. If you truly love a character, you'll be willing to go off the rails from canon with headcanons and alternate timelines to make their own story with their waifu.
<comment>
I switched waifus myself, so that should tell you something. Sometimes it's simply what needs to be done.
Would he prefer the weirdly flavoured snacks or the overly sweet candies?
Probably the weird snacks. Italian sweets aren't very sugary; I've heard anecdotes of Italians who came to America needing to use half the sugar in recipes. But then again Narancia might think something being that sweet is amazing.

waifu zoomin'
<comment>
you and waifu are going to start a band together. What kind of music would you make? What would you sing about?
Rock ballads most likely, something calmed but full of emotion that would fit her perfectly. She'd write a lot of songs related to romance for sure
waifu is heading off to college! what's her major?
She may go for something that's related to cooking as it's something she's great at and has worked on it before too
what's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
Improve my body in general, having a healthier diet and training harder when swimming. Still gotta take that lifeguard course though.
how gullible is waifu?
Not at all considering that she can easily see through lies
Saiyan arc Goku I guess? She has her superhuman servant strenght but she's really weak physically compared to other sevants. On her dragon form she definitely gets a huge boost on anime numbers.
how did that surprise turn into love?
Several months actually, didn't really care about her until the first event she had where I got to know how she is as a person and found her really charming, and then a while later when getting to know more about her past and story I couldn't stop thinking about her and feeling like a schizo over that obsession, that ended up turning into love.
need more dainty looking girls who are actually ferocious when they need be
That's her 100%, the contrast she gives is great

Husbando going vroom vroom!
<comment>
hearing this made me happy; I always felt bad that I hated how they handled Zamasu in the series, and therefore I tried to make headcanons and spin-offs where he got more depth and consistency. Something about this made me doubt myself and our love, but again, it's not like the creators of the show cared enough to write a good story and consistent characters.
<comment>
i like the idea behind him and black a lot, and they both had great voice acting 
i just wish dragon ball super wasnt dragon ball super. fuck, at least introduce him after the top to give him more backstory, and a better reason to go full genocide. actually do something with the other universes being pissed off at goku for putting them in the situation
<comment>
lot of grass types there, any reason why?
Well, it's a long story
I would like to hear it anytime, if you don't mind
(excluding his outfit in the past)
he had a different outfit before?
In the series he's only shown wearing different things in flashbacks
fashion in jojo is quite distinct. is it the same way in flashbacks?
spoiler
this but with strawberry pocky
kek on the pic
I think what this fandom needs much more are lore headcanons!
see, now that is way more interesting. I'm surprised their origins were never explained yet
I've also been brainstorming huge comics about Four's early life in my head for the past month
hell yeah godspeed, anon
<comment>
you and waifu are going to start a band together. What kind of music would you make? What would you sing about?
I think it'd be rock. Give him the mic and an electric guitar, and I'd be on the keyboard. We'd sing about finding our way back onto the road so to speak. Something like this. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LehMuyIkxNE [Embed]
The lyrics remind me of Shadow, especially 3:16 or so onwards. A-and maybe he could wear an outfit like pic related...God, it single handedly made me like multiple piercings.
waifu is heading off to college! what's her major?
None of them suit him honestly. Engineering and Biological/Biomedical Sciences are my best guesses.
what's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
Watch anime. My first anime was Kill la Kill because of him. It was alright, good but nothing amazing. The fight scenes were kino though.
how gullible is waifu?
Not at all. At least not in main canon... 
In his introduction, he tricks Eggman flawlessly into going along with his genocide plan. 
Shadow: Exactly. To reactivate the machine, we need the seven Chaos Emeralds. Once you have that, then you have the ultimate power of destruction to use as you please. And then... the world could be yours.
Eggman: Sounds like a plan! I like the way you think, Shadow! I will get the Chaos Emeralds, use the machine to dominate the world and build a legacy of my own!
He's such a good liar...or, maybe it's not 100% lying, it's just lying by omission. He left out the part where all seven Chaos Emeralds would crash the entire space colony into the Earth. Silly Shadow...
It's hard for me to imagine it since I've been obsessed with Shadow for 9 years now. That being said, I don't think switching waifus once or even twice makes one an "illegitimate waifuist".
If someone's had more than 3 waifus I generally think "Oh, so they're just going to drop this one as soon as they get bored" and it's hard for me to take them seriously. I'm open to being proven wrong.

fluid dynamics
as in the physics of fluid? 
go to fanfic site (ao3)
oh man I haven't been there in forever. I actually have 1 1/2 unrelated fics posted there some fics are pretty nice but you have to swim through a ton of shit. there was one dramatical murder cracfic that had my sides in orbit
They weren't exactly popular and, admittedly, had some questionable methods. However, they did stop a plot to burn down Kyoto, allegedly
not every pretty ending has a pretty solution I suppose. at least they got the job done
Technically, that would cure her magic TB
oh damn, like someone placed a curse on her?
6 Mewtwos she convinced the other Shinsengumi members to trade her
6 of the same pokemon??
Yes, her husband got them for her as a kind of anniversary gift. I think she looks great in them.
based. very cute daki there. she looks so comfy
artstyle change in season 4
nevermind, bully them all even though that's more of the lead art director's fault
All my good ones were on a computer I dont use very often (my old PC)
I don't know how but my sister in law was able to move all the files from my old computer onto a new one via wireless downloading
I have found that it was just easier to cut myself off
you gotta do what works for you
 Also, pornography felt demeaning to Aqua to me. Like I was boiling her down to nothing but a sex object, a doll
I would say it's depending on how you do it. sexualizing on it's own? demeaning. but many girls want to be seen as sexy by their lover on top of being cute and charming!
how about dainty looking girls who are usually pretty dainty but can be mean when they need to?
also acceptable
<comment>
you and waifu are going to start a band together. What kind of music would you make? What would you sing about?
he can play piano and I can ting a triangle kek. he'd be lead vocal and I'll be backup. we can make story songs
waifu is heading off to college! what's her major?
music theory and glass blowing, though the later is a headcanon
what's something waifu has inspired you to start doing?
he inspires me to be a more kind and outwardly loving person towards others and myself. he also motivates me to work on my passions
how gullible is waifu?
slightly above average. if you are his friend he'd trust your words so fast it'd be easy to prank him
what was the name of that text free for all site an anon posted here several threads ago? the one where you could type anything about waifu along with other anons
thanks for the suggestion, but I'm just not feeling it
no problem, I hope you find more music 
maybe i'll request some Kim stuff when you do
oh that'd be fun to see. I haven't been on /co/ in ages
I would fucking kill a man for the chance
wouldn't us all. i-in minecraft, of course!
Rock ballads most likely, something calmed but full of emotion that would fit her perfectly
we /throwback 80s/ now
didn't really care about her until the first event she had where I got to know how she is as a person and found her really charming
what a lucky turn of events. good thing you partook in the game at the time. have there been other events for kyou?

Not at all, no. In the flashbacks, characters actually wear more or less normal clothes.

i like the idea behind him and black a lot, and they both had great voice acting
Ikr? I also loved the dark yet majestic vibe the arc had, and the soundtracks are top-tier. I'm kinda conflicted though about Zamasu being Black since he hates mortals, so taking the body of one seems ooc (not to mention that he could've just wished to be stronger or for all mortals/GoDs to perish instead of stealing a rando's body). Hell even if he had gotten Goku from another timeline where he didn't fall on his head and become good, that would make more sense than stealing his body.
at least introduce him after the top to give him more backstory, and a better reason to go full genocide. actually do something with the other universes being pissed off at goku for putting them in the situation
damn I also had the same idea, it'd give him more time to develop as a character and a valid reason for being pissed at Goku (not that he didn't have one tho), and I'd like to see Goku from Super get punished for being an asshole throughout the show.
I would like to hear it anytime, if you don't mind
well it's kinda complicated to explain since I had to use some canon material and add to it (it's also not focused solely on Zamasu).
I'll summarize his arc tho, he came back but was less insane after getting erased once and got spared by a mortal, so he began doubting his beliefs.
but many girls want to be seen as sexy by their lover on top of being cute and charming!
Aqua appears to be the type who would want this. (Or the kind to act showy?)

wife asking you to come cuddle with her after work (she already put her pajamas on and made the bed)
but many girls want to be seen as sexy by their lover on top of being cute and charming!
Oh, I completely agree. I just don't want to boil her down to just a sex object. It feels degrading. I see sex as a very sensual, loving and private thing. I try to avoid porn because it rips that apart.
Aqua appears to be the type who would want this. (Or the kind to act showy?)
Oh, she 100% would. I do see her acting showy with me, even after we marry. I do see her like that because she really is both
<comment>
I am curious, how do you feel about how SDBH handled Zamasu (and other Zamasu/black)?
Kind of seems ooc
I think the idea was that he wanted an ironic victory against the ningens, he didn't just want to kill all mortals, but also to humiliate and make a mockey of them.
<comment>
how do you feel about how SDBH handled Zamasu
Sadly, I didn't watch all of SDBH (all episodes consist of the same formula: a fight that ends with a gigantic ki blast) but I know that Black and Fused Zamasu had reappeared. I dunno what happened to Black but he got that cool ass design with the mask, and he apparently defeated Goku hundreds of times. Fused Zamasu though...he was turned into a jobber to the new villain, Hearts, which ruins what made Zamasu great - his divinity, his pride, his obsession with justice at the cost of balance, the fact that they needed Zeno himself to defeat him since their mary sue protagonist couldn't - all discarded just to make Hearts' dick look bigger, which is pretty normal for dragon ball to do, but it got old quickly. (Don't get me wrong tho, Hearts is cool and I wish he killed that annoying pest Zeno, but the fact he got a redemption whereas Zamasu was treated as an annoying cockroach that needs to be disposed of is irritating me)
I think the idea was that he wanted an ironic victory against the ningens
I also thought that but I'd expect him to seethe at the very idea of having his soul inside a mortal's body - he lost his shit just because Jiren's foot scratched his hair that one time. I still like Black though, but I wish he wasn't Zamasu in Goku's body  not to mention that Jiren, who's stronger than a GoD, existed but instead of asking Zuno who's the strongest mortal there is, Zamasu just snatched the body of the first strong person he could think of

Husbando surprising you with a new pet! I always wanted to give him another fuzzball to love but the reverse seems more likely. He's always traversing other worlds, I could easily see him coming home with the least fleabitten and bite-y creature he could find.
tfw waifu will never do the default dance
Imagine not practicing tulpa imposition for that reason alone.
Probably the weird snacks. Italian sweets aren't very sugary; I've heard anecdotes of Italians who came to America needing to use half the sugar in recipes. 
America moment. Would Narancia also be snobby over westernized Italian cuisine? 
But then again Narancia might think something being that sweet is amazing.
Introducing husbando to flavours beyond his comprehension.
<comment>
also forgot to mention that I like Zamasu's design and concept, so just using Goku in a black outfit instead of my greenie was a waste.
I don't want to sound like a /dbs/ fag but I hate how they did my boy dirty

He's not really that type of person but I could definitely see him being at least disappointed. Sometimes I wonder about things like what he'd think of pineapple on pizza.

Somewhere only we know - Keane
Girl at the rock show - blink 182
Make it wit chi - Queens of the Stone Age
Me and Rene - Weston
Im the man who loves you - Wilco
I only want you - Eagles of Death Metal
I could find more but I scrolled through most of my 2000+ song playlist to find that
I can think of a few non rock songs (Mirrors by Justin Timberlake) and a few that dont exactly fit any relationship outside of my own (praise you by fat boy slim)
Overall music is a thing that really helps bring me closer to Aqua
It isnt always about lyrics but about the tone and sound
It helps me imagine her more vividly
<comment>
saw this right after my last post lol
 and then my tiny chihuahua jumps on top of us in jealousy
Sometimes I imagine me and Aqua are cuddling together after a long day. And just as we find the exact right position tk be in for maximum comfort for our kids come home from school lol
 as long as you make aqua feel sexy and wanted in your private time!
I would do both privately and publiclly. I love her very, very much and I wouldnt want to bottle that up. Its why I talk about spoiling her and praising her on the daily so much. She just deserves it, every last drop. I just dont like talking about sexual matters over the internet lol

see, now that is way more interesting. I'm surprised their origins were never explained yet
I'm suprised myself! Considering that algebraliens as a concept have been around since 2008 and the creators still haven't made any backstory for them. Sure, there's "The Number Playground Chronicle!" which expands the lore a bit and shows more genuses of algebraliens such as polygons and irrationals but it's not really lore heavy, it's mostly about the everyday life of them. I have nothing but respect for Huang brothers but this one's a bummer.. I guess I have no choice but to do it myself!
hell yeah godspeed, anon
Heh, thanks! :D

By any chance do you have a card that comes with a pilot suit?
Unfortunately no, not too much into mecha media. Why not create a suit yourself, can encourage more creative stuff.
This, Mexicans really like DBZ, it's like their Naruto or AoT
Zoomer waifu
Imagine not practicing tulpa imposition for that reason alone.
Meant more along the lines of actually having an animation of it. Regrettably, she can do the default dance if she wants to.
I ought to practice imposition more though

Thanks! honestly, I was wondering whether or not it was haha-
are you the mortal who spared him?
No, but I'm still conflicted as to who that mortal would be (I have a few ideas in mind).
if not, how do you meet him?
I imagine that after he started doubting his beliefs he starts mentoring a mortal (an OC I talked about before) before he unceremoniously joins her team. In the headcanon, they're not dating, just friends(?) and teammates. But whenever I want to cuddle Zamasu I imagine that they do
it's a pretty intimate and trusting act depending on who you ask
This. I don't understand people who want sex for the sake of it. Just the idea of fucking someone you're attracted to physically and not emotionally is sickening to me

Jobber to Hearts
I think the dumbest part is that I don't think they even explain how he returned, at least not in the promo anime, maybe in the manga. Fair enough on the disappointment, he thankfully had a time to shine in-game as his card alongside Hoi (wizard from Hirudegarn) movie was a tiered strategy, until he became a jobber to Goku (a promo had his most defining feature with an actually good ability) before intense power creep came in and shoved many other cards into bulk bins, though the original merged zamasu did have a promo that saw a good deal of play (it was just two really good basic abilities mixed together and the only card to have both abilities).
Black
So I think what happened is that Fu (the Dark King of Fanfic) basically gave Black a timeline to farm against Gokus, somehow resulting him in almost becoming SSR4 (SSRFP has him grow a fucking tail). He lost to SSBE Gogeta.
Lack of redemption
I wouldn't be surprised if it's somewhere in the cards, we did have Masked Super 17 work with Goten (Xeno) for a fight and I think they left the door open for a redeemed Cell a year-ish ago (unless the new evil Cell in the most recent set is the same Cell from the one that helped Goku and Vegeta). In XV2 headcanon my CaC got Zamasu to chill by showing him that fighting isn't just barbarism unlike how a room temp IQ monkey acts, it's also my in-world explanation on how I got SSR (bless modding). One cool moment in game is that if you carry your mentor (Zamasu is one) to the last mission in a dlc campaign, they'll have genuine praise for you and Zamasu is basically 'so this Kai of Time (and I'd argue the TP as a whole, less said about Trunks, the better) is a dumbass and despite being a mortal, I believe you'd be a better replacement, what do you say?'
How'd you think Doomguy would feel about a cute demonic furball?

I don't think they even explain how he returned
fr, and how tf was he convinced to help a mortal who wants to kill gods?
I guess you could brush off his return as Fu snatching him before he got destroyed, but helping Hearts? he did say that he sees Hearts as a means to an end but still, helping a mortal who wants to kill gods become strong that he can kill the same guy that killed you once and expect him to keep you alive? even Yamcha is smarter than that (no insults to my cute Greenie, just insulting the shitty writers who can't, for the life of them, keep things consistent and logical.)
he thankfully had a time to shine in-game
Finally, some appreciation-
until he became a jobber to Goku
Should've seen this coming, can't have a side character be stronger than the mary sue protagonist, now can we?
I'm still glad that he got some time to shine tho since his fusion was legit one of the strongest in the series
the Dark King of Fanfic
kek
almost becoming SSR4
Damn, that's one aspect I like about SBDH; they actually use other forms that didn't have time to shine in the main series outside of their introduction. And we get to see characters other than Goku do shit.
Idk if it makes sense though that Black kept on fighting the same dude over and over and somehow achieved new forms; you'd expect he'd need more challenging opponents if he managed to defeat Goku UI.
XV2 headcanon my CaC got Zamasu to chill by showing him that fighting isn't just barbarism
wow, how did they convince him?
last mission in a dlc campaign
I loved that scene! I know they probably made that scene just to appease the player by making their favorite mortal-hatin' god praise them but still, I like that it makes Zamasu not as one-dimensional and messy as he was in his arc, and it makes me believe that if he had an actual good experience with mortals, then he wouldn't go down the path he did.
and the scene where he calls for Tokitoki is cute since not all mentors actually do that.

Demonic? Well, uh... Poorly. It's hard to blame him after what they did to his own bunny. No amount of cuteness can mask pure evil, fluffles the hellspawn would be a fuzzy red stain.

Doesn't make sense
SDBH usually plays itself really fast and loose, some neat moments to take seriously (Yamcha might be getting hitched this current block) but is more for comfort food. Normally DBZ doesn't indulge in having an expanded universe beyond the manga/anime. Black also went SSR2 and SSR3 beforehand, and it could've been he did fight Gokus of multiple timelines. For other funny things, alt-universe versions of Goku/Vegeta basically went SS4+SSG with (SFPS4LB, love nippon but cursed fucking acronym).
How did [my cac] convince
The idea was basically reading things like Art of War/War and Peace (or think of a book written by Treize from Gundam), that there's more to conflict/fighting than what a mindless WAKU WAKU would have you believe. I'd imagine if the TP library was decent (or Fuu if not because I have him as a friend to my self-insert), they'd be a bit of bookworms while waiting for XV3 (if that is even going to happen, hyped for BT4 becoming real).
Meta (extra knowledge for the arcade game in Japan)
To my knowledge the goku meta is over (thankfully, imagine a match of 14 cards, 12 to take into account of hero avatars, and seeing ~8 gokus, and that not being a rare occurrence) and instead is more about Aeos (with her crew, goal is to make it there's only one timeline) and some small engines/good-stuff cards (like SuperHero (SH) Gohan/Piccolo, Robel/Demigra, Masked Black, etc.), meming with a Gogeta (GT) card, or going ham with good stuff cards. In World Mission (usually on sale for $6 and if you like arcade card games, I think its worth the time), Zamasu does have niches due to a limited card pool (STA generation and GRD/DMG reduction pierce are rare so a couple of his cards can shine in slower decks).
No amount of cuteness
I don't blame him but surely he'd recognize not all underworlds are like that, the fur ball I posted just wants to cuddle someone's ankles like its with mommy, it can trip you.

I meant fluid physics
ok cool so I had the right idea in mind. she could help in designing water theme park attractions
rock songs
based blink182 enjoyer
And just as we find the exact right position tk be in for maximum comfort for our kids come home from school lol
damn kids and their cock blocking kek. sometimes you just catch a break
Its why I talk about spoiling her and praising her on the daily so much. She just deserves it, every last drop
it's so cute how many anons just want to shower their waifu with love and spoil them. so selfless and wholesome. it's got me wanting to clumsily attempt showering clear on his birthday
I just dont like talking about sexual matters over the internet lol
of course, didn't mean to sound like I was prying if I did. guess I'm just used to how open this site is about it's desires
Considering that algebraliens as a concept have been around since 2008 and the creators still haven't made any backstory for them
what the hell? they need to get on it. maybe it's hard to find the time what with juggling so many characters
it's mostly about the everyday life of them
what was everyday life like for them?
I guess I have no choice but to do it myself!
do give us your headcanons when you do. it might even become our own headcanons for four too
is your husbando the guy from dangan ronpa?
<comment>
I was wondering whether or not it was
90% of writing is all about execution imo. most things can work if done well
No, but I'm still conflicted as to who that mortal would be
roll a die kek jk. you could make a pros and cons chart of their dynamics maybe
I imagine that after he started doubting his beliefs he starts mentoring a mortal (an OC I talked about before) before he unceremoniously joins her team. In the headcanon, they're not dating, just friends(?) and teammates. But whenever I want to cuddle Zamasu I imagine that they do
so this oc sometimes serves as a self insert on top of you also being a character in this?
these are great holy shit thanks clearbro
glad to help even just a little bit. it was fun taking a nostalgia trip going through these songs
pricking the voodoo doll
kek. is that canon?
recently woke up and already want to go back to bed kek but otherwise comfy. hope you are also cozy
<comment>
that is in fact canon, yes.
<comment>
Not really. Tired, uncomfortable, hot and a bit drunk. I wish sleep still refreshed me. 
It'd be so nice if I could rest my head on Shadow, just for a moment. Or he brought me an ice pack. But I know he'd have stuff to say about my situation. He'd think I'm doing a lot wrong in life right now, and he'd be right. He's not the enabling type. I wonder if other people can relate to knowing their waifu wouldn't like the way they currently live life.
<comment>
gods falling in love with mortals is based
I guess Aqua is different because she regards mortals on an equal playing field as her for the most part
I just give myself some level of godhood because I don't want a Skips situation (from regular show)
I would assume they would be. Or maybe I find some way to become a demigod and than they're like 75% gods.
doing ok just burned out from studying
As for spoiling her I just want to show her how much I love her. I mean, she does already very clearly responds well to being praised, but I just want to make her feel loved I guess. Beyond just hollow praise and gifts.
 I'm just used to how open this site is about it's desires
It's alright. I just don't like to overshare about stuff like that. I guess I just feel like it's overly voyeuristic
I don't write myself as much anymore because of school (and because my writing is just shit and I throw out everything after 2 pages) but if you are trying to get into writing, a lot of it is just down to caring about what you write about. If you have a connection with what you're writing about it becomes a lot easier
<comment>
God im autistic.
I meant to say that I want to give her real honest praise and help, not just tell Aqua how much I love her for no reason. I spoil and praise and love her so much because I do.

pre bed bump.
right now, I'm thinking of just how thankful I am that the Scott Pilgrim franchise exists at all.
I mean, of course it gave me my wife, my beloved, my cherished.
but outside of that it's just genuinely a really solid piece of fiction.
I'm not going to pretend like it's a masterpiece. but it's certainly great. 
the vibe of the whole thing is immaculate and it somehow manages to remain a sort of timeless appeal despite being heavily steeped in a certain time and place in human history (i.e early-mid 2000s era Canada).
Millennials, Gen X, AND Zoomers all like Scott Pilgrim.
how did Bryan Lee O'Malley fucking do it?
I just wish he did more side stories or one offs set in the universe of Scott Pilgrim.
maybe a little something exploring the video game laws of physics that her world appears to follow. (i.e 1-ups, ridiculous shonen-tier attacks and fighting that can be performed by otherwise ordinary people. the existence of stats, the idea that apparently if you're vegan enough you can become a psychic powerful enough to punch craters into the moon)
I've always believed that Scott Pilgrim was a 21st century fairy tale. (which, in many ways. is also applicable to the various video games Scott Pilgrim was inspired by, such as Zelda and Mario.)
it's got such a comfy, cozy vibe to it.
and I'd give anything to be in their world and with Kim. (I've said that practically billions of times. and I'll say it billions of times again because it's still true)

have there been other events for kyou?
She's had multiple events where she had an appearance though can't recall anything with her on a main role. She appears mainly on valentine's and summer. She kind of took over her neet friend's personal chapter too since she ended up appearing more than her.

what is waifu's favorite part of the day?
<comment>
I have a feeling Kim's a night owl
completely unrelated Kim fact: Kim is a month older than Scott, Scott was born on September 27th thus. making Kim's birthday October 27th assuming she literally means exactly a month older.
I like to think this is the case, October 27th is a cool date.
<comment>
Kotori is still kute, I still love her.
DBZ is stereotypically associated with blacks.
It's huge in LatAm
nevermind, bully them all
I'm out for blood, she deserves better than the awful creator, and the people that perpetuate such an awful series
<comment>
Not my favourite interpretation, but there is chocolate so it is valid.
I love Chara! And feel love in return.

Hope all the waifufags/husbandofags are cozy currently.
I'm alright. Having a little trouble falling sleep tonight, but I'm snuggled in bed, sipping on tea (again) and imagining husbando with me, a little bloodied and tuckered out, murmuring about his day. It was the same as the last. 
I don't blame him but surely he'd recognize not all underworlds are like that, the fur ball I posted just wants to cuddle someone's ankles like its with mommy, it can trip you.
Perhaps exceptions can be made then. Maybe he would snatch them up and bring them out of whatever rotten realm they're stuck in, if that happens to be their predicament.

SDBH usually plays itself really fast and loose
for real, dragon ball can be one of two things: fast paced that you can't understand how something happened, or slow paced that you get bored quickly.
Goku/Vegeta basically went SS4+SSG
wait really? I know that Xeno Goku n Bejita can use SS4 but I didn't know they can also use SSG
cursed fucking acronym
Kek it's funny how long the acronyms got
mindless WAKU WAKU would have you believe
lol fr, rethinking back on the sparring scene with Zamasu; Goku was being a dick for insisting on sparring after being turned down a few times and then calling Zamasu a stink in the mud for rightfully telling him to fuck off
But I'm still blaming Zamasu's sorry excuse for a mentor  and I guess Zamasu disliking the idea that mortals can access god power does make sense since...well you saw what Buu did.. and only god knows what will happen if Freeza decides to attack the Kais when Beerus is asleep.
XV3
I hope they actually make that since the creators seem busy adding more DLCs to XV2. It'd be cool if in XV3, we get to have our mentor in all missions instead of a DLC, and I hope Fu would be involved in the main story.
World Mission
I still haven't played World Mission but hearing you talk about it is getting me excited. And now I have more reason to use Zamasu's card hehe
<comment>
90% of writing is all about execution imo.
agreed. Sadly I only have concepts for the story rn but I'll try to flesh it out more once I have more spare time
you could make a pros and cons chart of their dynamics
Oh yeah that sounds helpful! thanks! I was trying to do all this mentally so I ended up forgetting some aspects of each character
so this oc sometimes serves as a self insert on top of you also being a character in this?
nay, I only use the OC as a self-insert (on top of her being a character in her own right), I don't imagine myself with Greenie since I'll stand like a sore thumb in the DB universe lol (But the OC kinda acts like me so it's not hard when I self insert)

<comment>
what the hell? they need to get on it. maybe it's hard to find the time what with juggling so many characters
I guess that's the reason! The creators have also been making Firey comic series at around the same time X Finds Out His Value came out. None of the BFDI characters actually have an elaborate backstory nor have the whole concept of objects have ever been explained in any way, I guess it's a kind of a norm
what was everyday life like for them?
Fun and games and also some business and sports talk! Foury and X and others were young kids back then, around 11 or 12 in human years, just like the Huang brothers who were middle schoolers back then so the mood of the comic is light-hearted and humorous!

do give us your headcanons when you do. it might even become our own headcanons for four too
Oh, I can actually give some now! These are mostly general algebralien lore ones, I'll write about Four's personal ones later!
All the integers were created by a super old and crazy powerful algebralien named Infinity. Algebraliens who represent mathematical concepts without a true value and similiar things are something like archons in the Number Playground dimension, they came first and created all the other genuses
Four is around the same age as his friends, except X, who is a year younger and Ten, who is a year or 2 older than the single digit integers
All algebraliens have supernatural powers by default but their power level is directly linked to their mathematical value
So from the previous point stated, Four is powerful but is easily defeated by Five and others greater than him
Algebraliens are biologically immortal plus they age slowly, while the time gap between XFOHV and first season of BFDI is only 2 years, this time gap is only relevant to real life, in universe events of XFOHV probably took over thousands years before any of the objects were born
Because the time on Number Playground flows differently, it's impossible to accurately calculate Foury's age but I think he's over 300 thousand years old while in human years he's a yound adult, around 22-23
Algebraliens as a species have an usual naturally occuring event that happens when they reach maturity: their body's color changes to lighter shades of the one they had since birth. Explaination as to why Foury was dark blue in XFOHV and became lighter blue in BFB
Welp, those are all I have for now, though I might make some more eventually!

nothing wrong with repeating it if it's true.
night because she gets to drink and hang out with friends
very good choices
CAKE is one of my favorite bands of all time
decent model her head is just way too big for her body
I do the same thing with my self insert, I try to actually make him work as a character and not just me with another name
so who created infinity? would you describe them as gods?
<comment>
what is there to do on weekends other than appreciating my adorable Zamasu? I swear he's one of the few things in life that make me genuinely happy
self insert
my OC wasn't made to be self insert, she was just my custom character in a DB game that I grew fond of and use as a self insert when needed
I try to actually make him work as a character
if you don't mind sharing, I'd like to hear more about him; what's his name? does he have a background? is he in an AU of Konosuba or the main story?
<comment>
so who created infinity? would you describe them as gods?
Well, surely he came from somewhere, maybe he was even cretaed by someone but I haven't thought that far yet! I'll write a more detailed origin tale someday for sure!
<comment>
if you don't mind sharing, I'd like to hear more about him; what's his name? does he have a background? is he in an AU of Konosuba or the main story?
I always decided on him being in an AU of some kind.
The story is he was an American guy named Connor who somehow ended up dying in Japan in some hilariously cartoonish accident. After stuttering and stammering his way to heaven, he chooses to be reincarnated with the ability to throw lightning bolts (think like a mini-Zeus).
After being reincarnated and choosing to become a Mage (Wizard? I forgot how the classes work in Konosuba) he eventually meets back up with Aqua and her party several weeks later.
Slowly, he and Aqua start to grow closer and closer. They become fast friends, and, eventually lovers. This is pretty self explanatory. It's just us falling into cheesy romance.
In the real world, his brother struggles to cope with his death. He begins to search for answers, believing his brother isn't dead, but in some other world. (I don't have a brother IRL.)
Eventually, after the demon king is defeated, the Brother manages to finally break the barrier between the two worlds. By this time, Aqua and Connor have married, and the two have grown tired of the fantasy world. They move back into the real world, having children and starting a life together as normal people.
He's designed to be similar to me in a lot of ways. Stammering, anxious autist. I guess the main difference is he has more confidence that I do. I know I glossed over a lot, but I don't really write this stuff down. I just treat it as just a bunch of mini stories in one big universe. I always wanted to make a comic out of it though
<comment>
Didn't know
So the full name (blame Japan) Super Full Power Saiyan 4 Limits Broken, is where they go SS4 and then have a god ritual to do it (the first time anyway), did it against a revived Janemba from a living Dr.Wheelo. And because it's an arcade game that loves ballooning stakes and satiating fanfics, we have SFPS4LB Vegito/Gogeta, and zBroly (because Japan really loves zBroly). They also did their own take on Majin Vegeta 2.0 with SSBEBC (Berserker Controlled), and even gave Turles some love making him be more a proper saiyan as he clowns SS3 Raditz (which is in the SDBH game and a decent new player card despite the moderate rarity).
Gowasu
"Ah yes, my student thinks that mortals are just inbred dumbasses, I know! Let's bring him into a race literally called barbarians!" - Gowasu, probably.
XV3
I hope for XV3 on the one condition it won't pretend to be an MMO and instead be DBZ's take on a bioware rpg, I need branching paths, alt endings, and being able to tell the TP to fuck off for Fuu/Demon Realm. Also Raids are easily the worst part of XV2, not even Hero Collosseum is as bad.
More reason
It does have a demo (yes, a game in 2019 based on a gacha arcade game, with no microtransactions, free updates, and a fucking demo, sometimes DBZ is blessed) if you want to give its gameplay a try, it's 90% based around a timing mini-game where whoever is closer to the edge wins (I saw Legends has this somewhere). Will warn that it is old when compared to the card game, so a bit of the arcade stuff isn't in it (for relative terms, we barely got SS4 Vegito (Xeno) and SSB Gogeta (BR), we didn't get SSFP Broly (BR), only base and wrath, and we don't even have Majin A21 despite there being a mission with her in the arcade mode, don't even have Hearts and barely included Fu). If you're open to 3ds emulation, there is Ultimate Mission X which is about DBH, but requires a janky english patch. In there Zamasu is much worse and Goku Black is just depression in a can.

alice's future? with you of course!
Thanks. Hopefully one day. I'd make sure for Alice's life with me to be the best she could imagine.
so the outline got leaked? what happens in it?
Not really leaked. Alice's creator uploaded it for free. Long story short, Alice's inner child has to battle her inner shadow self (inside Alice's Wonderland), for Alice to be complete as a person. I like how it's heavily based on Jungian's psychology. Anyway, at the end Alice opens a home for orphans, which is a beautiful ending considering that she was an orphan herself.
as long as you two get proper rest afterwards
I can rest when I'm dead. Life with Alice would need to be lived to the fullest.
how do feel about her new look?
I really do like it. It makes my beloved look as if she had finally found her place in life. She also looks less edgy, and I actually admired her edgy goth look. Guess I'm maybe still not mature enough for that Alice lmao. But she could fix me I'm sure.
Beautiful.
what is your favorite outfit for waifu?
Ahhh my most beautiful Alice mesmerizes me beyond any words when she wears the dress that she wears in her real world. Such a natural beauty.
what do you think of waifus source material?
One of my favourite games. Though it's not the best game per se, as it can get a bit repetitive, but oh man how gorgeous it is thanks to the unique art direction. I even initially bought it to admire the nice surrealistic landscapes. Well, Alice of course was the attractor too, but not really the deciding one.
Thank you. Alice really deserved that.
Do you imagine yourself on her world or just yours?
Her in mine. Though its definitely much easier to insert myself in hers now. Just seems less possible for that to happen, despite the other option not being exactly possible either heh
wonder how he'd feel about
He appreciates it definitely. But he also seemed to be defeated in terms of trying anymore. Said that he needs to move on.
<comment>
Interesting story! and a much better wish than Kazuma's petty one. Buddy's family laughed at his death, but he took this anger out by forcing someone he just met to accompany him instead of wishing himself a power or something. certified dumbass fr. Tho if it weren't for Aqua he wouldn't be where he is rn.
Also I see potential in your story that you can tie to yourself somehow; like Connor died and Eris pitied him since he was so in love with Aqua that she allowed him a wish and he wished for Aqua to come with him into the normal world
god ritual
Oh so basically they went SSJ4 and then did the SSG ritual? That makes sense considering there were more than 5 pure hearted saiyans in the time patrol
Gowasu
lmao he really is a dumbass, and idek if the entire thing was worse in the anime or manga since in the anime the Barbarians never changed while in the manga there was slight evolution (that Zamasu couldn't see since they were attacked) but the old fart apparently suffered from alzheimer since he never brought it up again
it won't pretend to be an MMO
I didn't play online, so it really won't make a difference if it was an MMO or not; I'm just a sucker for the gameplay and the stats thing although I admit it wasn't the best
branching paths, alt endings
A great concept! but shitty staff that only makes game for the money, Budokai was probably the last game they put love into considering the many references and hidden details
Fuu
Choosing whether or not to help Fu sounds good desu, I felt the player just protecting him in the DLC, while I felt justified considering he didn't do anything evil, should be up to the player.
Raids
Lmao I didn't play a raid past the training part, something about it felt restraining somehow, glad I wans't the only one who hated those
In there Zamasu is much worse and Goku Black is just depression in a can.
kek that got a laugh outta me

you're telling me lol
Also I see potential in your story that you can tie to yourself somehow; like Connor died and Eris pitied him since he was so in love with Aqua that she allowed him a wish and he wished for Aqua to come with him into the normal world
I always saw it as him aging as Aqua remains the same age. Eventually the Gods begin to take pity upon him and grant her immortality so they can be together forever.
I also just had ideas of how I could nerd out about Olympic gods and stuff. Like Connor has to navigate the politics and worlds of the myriad of gods to try and prove that he should be able to court one of their kind.
being taller than your partner is better.

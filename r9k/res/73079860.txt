What does it take for someone to cheer you up?
I am beyond miserable so the simplest things cheer me up. Someone told me I had a nice voice today and it made me so happy I spent the entire day giggling about it. It's been so long since I got a compliment 
What about you? Are you cheered up easily?
I want a pretty girl to cut off pieces of her flesh for me whenever I feel sad, and show me the damage and chunk of flesh.
People can't cheer me up. A few people might be able to tell me how to do something which could cheer me up, but other than that I don't care even a little bit about the words of another person or their affection

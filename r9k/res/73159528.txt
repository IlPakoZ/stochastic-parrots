just found out the private pool a few blocks down is unlocked. should i go for a swim?
Only if you scouted out the location to see the people living there aren't home.
it's a giant apartment complex
someone probably shit in it, but go ahead anyway be our turdboy
yes hurry up and swim before the water becomes polio
then you're chilling my boy
i will do a few laps and quickly go home before people ask me where i came from and i get detained or something
confidence is key when being somewhere you dont belong OP and dont forget a towel and sunscreen
yeah just pretend you live there, and if someone asks don't stutter and spill your spaghetti

i am already getting insanely bored of video games, booze, masturbation, and youtube 
this has not been a pleasant life.
<comment>
I reached this stage like 3 years ago now i really don't know what's next. All I know is it doesn't go away on its own
<comment>
i really dont know either. Ive been trying to stimulate this brain for so long and it keeps fighting back. I guess this is what it wants
<comment>
if you missed out on young love its over.

There's no magic answer. Life is what it is. I've already known three guys that died before 35 by increasing the alcohol and drug use from despair. I don't recommend that path.

i had young love. my life is still fucking terrible probably worse than everyone here.

Same, spent 2 whole days playing (pirated) age of wonders 4, bored the entire time, yet I keep playing.

I'm now sick and miserable since 2 years. It's a challenge not to become bitter. I had problems with depression since my teenage, but now I know that physical pain is even more prone to pull a soul to the dark side of anger and hate. It's an endless struggle, and no rest. Often I could just scream. When I tried to kill myself as a teen, my body was healthy ... now I don't want to die, but I hate it so much to live with this sick body.
I use youtube and 4chan to distract myself. And alcohol to numb the pain. Going out is too exhausting, even walking stairs is a workout.
I try to not hate society for pushing me to get the damned shot, and the ignorant doc who doesn't even want to take responsibility for it. Maybe I will have to live like this now. Yeah, it's not a pleasant life.

same feeling bros. never thought that would happen to me. work's shit too. feeling so purposeless and lost. not a single "good thing" helps me anymore to stop feeling that way. I was thinking for a long time that I need to inflict some kind of pain on myself. maybe I'll enjoy pain and struggle. almost joined the army. I can talk about this stuff till tomorrow... but I did made action.
I'm planning to run away in 6 weeks. saved enough money. got my bike. I'll try to see and experience everything. I won't be focusing too much on the people but rather on nature. 
even though this fantasy I'll soon realize, is just another escapism of my many, I still feel good and warm. it gives me optimism. it's waking up my inner adventurer and explorer. 
wish you the same bros. find that "new thing"

I don't give a shit about love. Nothing excites me

Fuck off kikeberg

The YouTube algorithm is busted. It recommends 100 different variations of the same schizophrenic tiktok reuploads. 90% of videos it recommends are things I have already seen. I wouldn't want to pay for streaming services either. The state of entertainment is apocalyptic. It's so bad that I actually get things done out of boredom.

my dad drank himself to death the one thing i never understood is he never had hangovers in all of his years drinking. he would drink 24 and 32 packs. if you start drinking in the morning after all day of drinking do you just not get hungover. is that just alcohol tolerance. also he never seemed fully drunk until he before he passed
<comment>
sip beer slowly make sure you eat good and get a lot of water. a lot less hangovers.

I wish I had as much courage as you. Looking at the way the world is heading and what my ever-decreasing options are in it, the idea of just saying fuck it and going on an adventure sounds like the only way forward. 
I just have absolutely no idea what I would do. The best idea I have is going with a PMC/NGO that agrees with my politics, but I don't know if that even exists. I just want to explore and fight for something real, but the places one can do those things are scant these days.
Until that changes I'll just keep waiting for SHTF so I can do pic rel.

Get a skill.
The process of aquiring it is gonna suck shit and be boring but afterwards you'll at least have an upgrade to you as a person.
It can be anything and you don't have to do it more than once but make sure you can get good at a thing at least once and you should see an overall improvement of your life and a raise in confidence.
I'm currently trying to do that with drawing after years of procastrination.
I will suck balls at it but at least burning time on practice makes me feel less hollow than playing factorio for 2k hours

running away
saved enough money
Unless you're carrying your entire bank account in cash, your family / the police will just track your card transactions and drag you back within a few days.

insanely bored of video games
I felt the same, so bored of rpgs, so I started playing retro racing games. Pretty good rush.

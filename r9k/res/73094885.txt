Does jewelry make you look more attractive and approachable?
anything more than a nice watch is normalfagging
Yes. Now put on the earrings and come sit on daddy's lap, dear.
I get compliments on it all the time, girls like it and it stands out just enough to be a good litmus test &amp; conversation starter for people to interact with you "Where'd you get those rings anon?" "What kind of watch is that anon?", if you don't mind being a bit fruity, diy jewelry gives you a nice story to tell too
Yes but it also makes you a bigger target for robberies and such. I wear a small golden chain, that's it.
Jewelry can look nice if used sparingly. A watch or a chain is enough, and much more can look tacky easily
Aliexpress watches give you a decoy to drop if you get robbed, why carry a dummy watch when I can cough up a $20 piece of shit that looks like a Rolex

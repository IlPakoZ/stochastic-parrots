I dated a check for 5 years with BPD, NPD, who had bipolar issues as well. I will never, ever do that again to myself in this lifetime. The first couple years I just ignored it, it didn't really phase me until the last year it really started to get on my nerves because she wasn't changing and she didn't plan on changing, she didn't take any medicine, she didn't go to any therapy for DBT, she literally had zero emotion for anything or anybody. You're pretty much just there to buy her things, put her on a pedestal and tell her how special she is. I met her when I was 37 and she was 18. No power imbalance or anything, she was just a psychotic bitch and I Rose tinted glasses on until the last year two when I realized that I don't want to be married to this dumb bitch or be with her anymore. She's extremely fucking hot, but that doesn't account for her shitty ass fucking attitude. It's like the worst kind of narcissist to deal with.

Tbh, if bundy was careful about his DNA and his fingerprints he'd probably get as far as he did back then, if not farther.

you gotta take in consideration the surveillance cameras of today

He wouldn't even make it out the parking lot, so 0

And the communication and datasharing between law enforcement agencies. A much enhanced FBI. If you look at most of these serial killers, a lot of them just got lucky. It was crime records not being shared between departments. It was officers failing to do background checks or check plates. 
There's zero chance he'd get more than 10 kills today before getting caught.

so, in a third world country like, say, brazil, would he get more lucky than in here?

40% of all murders are left unsolved in America. And if he did it in a place like California now he would probably just get bail and go off killing again(he is a faggot after all. Cant be mean to the LGBT after all.)

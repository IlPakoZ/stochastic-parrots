Get in you loser signs loving lads.
<comment>
Nothing in the board rules to say you can't post images.
<comment>
Yes lid fully agree
<comment>
Funny how the post counter didn't go up when you replied there.
<comment>
Image hating tyrant also monitors the thread for new IPs. Sad loser.
<comment>
nah that wasn't me, see pic-related
<comment>
What about now lid
<comment>
How long have you been doing this for now? 8 hours?
<comment>
I posted the first image here lid, I was being ironic
<comment>
Hearing unconfirmed reports seasideMARK is getting a pulitzer for his AI research
<comment>
No time limit on posting images lad. Jog on bully boy.
<comment>
Posting spam with the implicit purpose of annoying people should be a cut and dry low quality posting ban. If you were doing it because youre weird its probably a free pass but if Mr Janny pulled up the threads they'd see very quickly that its low quality and simply trolling to annoy people and devalue the britfeel experience
<comment>
Just want lilt back
<comment>
You're not a janny you're just a mouth piece tyrant.
<comment>
1. jannies cant tell others or even allude to the fact that theyre a janny
2. see 1
DUH!
<comment>
He doesn't even know what tyrant means, nor do auditors. Tyranny has the implication of authority or power. They're just little spackers using a word they like to lash out at those around them.
<comment>
Write us some nonsense about your imaginary frog and then post an image of it with its le hair system
<comment>
Footlad and his right hand man losersignlad running the show now.

ALRIGHT GUYS ITS PJ AUDITS HERE. A TYRANT IS A MAN WHO I CAN DOMINATE DOESNT MATTER WHAT HE DOES, WHAT HE LOOK LIKE, WHAT HE THINK, AS LONG AS I CAN FLY THE DRONE UP AND HE DUNT LIKE IT HE WILL QUICKLY FIND OUT WHAT THE SCORE IS OHHHH DEAAAAAR.
<comment>
Is "spam mong" in the room with us now little Iad?
<comment>
For all the crying you did when the last thread hit image limit you aren't posting many images de leeeeeeeds. Get in sniff that.
<comment>
not everyone spends their entire free time on this trash general.
<comment>
The drone is the hot topic for auditors right now I wonder whats going to come next. Starting a barbecue in public space with plastic bags thrown on it so it releases dense toxic smoke? Im sure theres a lot of loopholes out there but these retards dont have free thinking (ironically) they have to wait to copy what other auditors do. Monkey see monkey do (gotta make sure other auditors do it first for a sustained period so they know its safe beyond any reasonable doubt as any real risk would leave them screaming and running off)

Why is everyone posting L's? Is it because living in the UK is an L in an of itself? I'm sorry for you bros, come back to our euro family, we can be friends

More likely to rape the men tbqh

Post the one with Shippys head grafted on, I forgot to save it last time
<comment>
Corr Lollers posting Ls now
<comment>
Nobody is trying to stop images being posted :)
They just don't like the ones you post, and the way that you are deliberately using up the image limit without contributing anything to the thread because of your little all-day crusade against imaginary enemies. Hope this helps! xx

nah gonna see suzume, jap anime. quite liked the directors other films

deliberately antagonise people
claim to be oppressed when people react
screech like a chimp about tyrants
Straight out of the auditor handbook. Attention whores the lot of them.
<comment>
Who knew /britfeel/ was full of oppressors
<comment>
we had some auditor turn up outside our work and started filming. security didnt give a fuck, told the guy to crack on, just dont come on the property. suspect he was raging they didnt get annoyed at him so he had nothing interesting to post to all his autistic tiktok followers
<comment>
I don't think there's much you can do to make a pizza crunch look nice.
<comment>
I've spoken to police before that were bragging about being audited, and others jealous that they had never been

I have committed crimes inside police stations before. LOL!
<comment>
Been all over the rules and non of them say I can't post images.
<comment>
Came close to being a police constable but failed training. Could have redone it but right at that time my cousin offered me a higher paying job
<comment>
What grew inside your mum was a crime, a crime against humanity you spastic x
<comment>
BritNormie is a special constable, but never mentioned it in the thread because he thinks it would lower people's opinions of him.
<comment>
failed training
how? i thought police was one of those token jobs that if all else fails in your life you could do with next to no skills, its why so many coppers are mongs, nobody does that job if they have a better option

He's far less of a loser than you. Nothing in the rules against posting frogs, tyrant

Need advice, I finally got a job and I love it, but it's temporary. There's another job that's boring and repetitive but it's full time with great benefits. It's mine if I want it. 
I have to go for it right?
<comment>
yeah the stuff is poison and doctors orders I go sober due to the effect it had with the lithium too 
anyway fresh start tomrorow lad no more alcohol for me 
well done on being sober as well x

She used to self-harm but now laurel dreams is on a new chapter of her life. Living in England has brought her a new found happiness.
<comment>
I'm not a dosser but staying in a temporary job I could end up one, full time is at least secure. But it's just a miserable job and I know I'll struggle to find another one.
<comment>
They're crying out for Nanny
Where are you Nanny??
<comment>
Dead end warehouse jobs during the week and no friends or family who'd want to see them on weekends. Winning!
<comment>
I'd go for it honestly. It's important to remember how deeply miserable unemployment can be. Is there any chance of your current job being extended?
<comment>
Girl I'm dating who is basically my gf (been 6 months) is very slow at texting back because she's alway studying which is good, how do i deal with feeling hurt by this? I know she cares for me very deeply and likes me a lot and if I told her this she'd be shocked but I feel so lonely and clingy. Fuck
<comment>
Nanny nanny they're posting images other than ASMR slags and seasideMARK REEEEEEEE
<comment>
the only possible job he is capable of getting is warehouse slavery 
yeah not all of us was licking windows during class lad x

Rather be neet than work in a warehouse all day for the rest of my life...especially when you don't get the friends or girlfriends. You never get to have fun.

Nah he's getting lots of attention on TikTok and women are in his DMs. 
He's in a better place than this time last year

It's actually the opposite. I'm quite sensitive to cold and known for wearing a jacket almost all year round
<comment>
Dawn of the dead is great mate stay womfy 
im off the wooze now until further notice 
weltdowns are fucking shit
<comment>
This is better than being a slave all day. Not like it brings me much better by working.
<comment>
Why aren't you offering support? Just like when SSM was having a weltdown begging his fans for help and you did nowt
<comment>
What about in theory if you were the kind of person who could get a good job?
<comment>
how do i deal with feeling hurt by this?
stop caring about her. Firstly I assume you are shagging, correct? Mentally downgrade her in your mind to a fuckbuddy, put zero effort into her, and on the offchance things get better (it won't) then all the better.
I know she cares for me very deeply
She couldn't give a shit about you. She might not even be seeing another guy yet, but she's already lost interest in you.
 if I told her this she'd be shocked
Not shocked, just repulsed
 I feel so lonely and clingy
You are.

You can't be that much of a loser

I don't think ruthmong understands that when you do a job you are paid in money which can be exchanged for goods and services. He sees every action in life as a possible way to earn special tickets for the magic gf bus, and has no internal passions or aspirations of his own.

Maybe extended but they've told me it will never be permanent. But it's like right now, it's Sunday night and I have zero stress or anxiety about going in tomorrow, I've never had that before. Maybe I should just enjoy the stress free money for as long as I can, and when it ends go agency or something. Just seems like full time jobs are so hard to find now.
<comment>
im off the wooze now until further notice
Same here lid. Will be having the next week or so off. Life's better without weltdowns.

lmao what a nasty spiteful little post
Sorry if it came off that way. I just didn't want to sugar coat it, if you think anything I said is wrong then say so, but I don't think it's wrong, just a bit brutal

this is what it's like in the honeymoon phase.

Yes. If you miss the signal, she will get upset. Then she will look for reasons to make you jealous so you'll prove you love her. If that fails she'll try to trap you (do you think she's pretty) so you can fight to keep her.

cant believe you dug this up, i watched this so long ago
if it wasnt apparent, shes a meme known for looking crazy and being overly attached so this video is just ironic cause she is acting the opposite
essentially shes hiding her yandere self and being tsundere, anime fans stay winnin

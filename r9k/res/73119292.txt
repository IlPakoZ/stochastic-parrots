Anyone else waiting for a girls to approach them first? I know its highly unlikely but there is no way I can summon the balls to ask a stranger girl out. I'm in my 30s now and it has only happened once but she had a bf so it was a no go.

It's not going to happen unless you are extremely good looking. Even when they do approach first and try to make the first move it's never the girls you actually want to be talking to
<comment>
i have approached multiple women and have never gone anywhere with it. Confidence doesnt help if you arent attractive
Im 28 no and ive given up on fiding a loving relationship. Now i just bang hookers every now and then and comtemplate suicide the other days
<comment>
I hope not, I avoid eye contact and try to blend in. I despise having to think of a way to quickly end the conversation as fast as possible without being rude or weird.
<comment>
disagree. average looking guys can pull far hotter tail by asking girls out in real life instead of competing with chads on the dating apps

I'm in my 30s now
OP, you better be the sexiest bastard in town, cuz if not, you're waiting for absolutely nothing. Might as well wait for a million dollars to just fall into your lap.

It's not that rare for women to 'approach' first in the sense of like starting a conversation. It's unlikely for them to ask you out but it happens occasionally.

haha I have only ever had girls approach me
they all sucked and dumped me
<comment>
Yeah, by BEING the one's who make the first move. Not by sitting waiting for girls to approach them first.
<comment>
It is possible. But you could be waiting a long time. In the meantime you might as well approach a few chicks. Girls you get to know through normal, "accidental" circumstances, not randos on the street.

Done that my whole life
I'm now almost 26 and a KHV

the only time i got laid the girl approached me, but she remembered me from karaoke 4 months prior so i'd clearly made a mark on her already
<comment>
Wrong. All women, including really hot ones, frequently approach men. If you are not getting approached it means women find you sexually unattractive.
<comment>
Women won't even approach a guy if he's bleeding to death on a sidewalk so I don't know where you get that from. Women are more passive anyway, the closest I ever got to a woman approaching first is them seeing me in person in a friend group and then later using social media to reach out, but these types of girls are usually loose whores anyway.

30s 
still doesn't have the balls to approach women 
You literally have the mentality and emotional maturity of a middle schooler. If you haven't figured out something as basic as that by now, then you are either hopelessly immature and/or anxious. Life can be tough anon, you have to expose yourself to getting hurt in a way girls simply don't if you want love
<comment>
yes, this is probably why i'm still single despite otherwise being a 7/10
i am trapped in a cage of my own making
also in my country, people rarely ever start conversations with random people in public, so i'm legitimately waiting for something that doesn't even happen to chad

I understand that, I've overcome a lot of social anxiety issues and learned to face my demons, but the girl one is hard because the odds are so against us.You have to ask out 100 girls just to get one yes, I can't deal with that kind of bullshit.
<comment>
i'm never approaching women because it puts me in a weaker position, like i'm pleading and trying to sell myself to her. 
Bitch, i am a human of value equal to yours
<comment>
never approached
hardly chad or a model
had gfs anyway
cold approaches are for desperate clowns
<comment>
This. I will never put myself in a position lower than a woman, it's pathetic. Approaching women is actual simp mentality and those people should grow up. 
All that time "practicing" to talk to women and traumatizing yourself to brush off rejection is time that could be spent doing literally anything else that's more useful, grow up.
<comment>
no way I can summon the balls to ask a stranger girl out
bro you have to go to like a bar or something
you dont just go up to random women on the street and hit on them.
<comment>
I'm willing to approach if I get a remote sign of interest from a woman. Hasn't happened yet.
<comment>
No, I'm not in that boat. I can see where you're coming from though. It's not like you really get much to say in the matter until you get a yes or no decision to make. It's really foolish to say no when they pick you a lot of the time.
<comment>
Its more likely than you think especially among zoomers
This is also true esp abt the hot ones. Theyre usually so intimidating that a lot of guys who arent just monke want sex won't approach them so they usually take upon themselves and never get rejected really.
Albeit their idea of approaching might be sitting near you, starting up convos, but not actually asking you out usually
<comment>
Doesn't happen. I'm 30 and women have just given me strange compliments and run off before I can say anything back. Women are fucking cowards.
<comment>
im 21, the only time a girl every approached me irl she told me. "Hey this might sound weird, but you have a really nice jawline." and then she walked away. Happened a year ago but I still remember it vividly
<comment>
That's how I got every girlfriend and my wife.

Love is for anime not real life

I want to be a lesbian so that lesbians approach me >///&lt;

Sorry anon. They wont approach ugly guys, no, but sexually attractive men are approached and constantly harassed, multiple times a day, wherever they go. Women are desperate and profoundly thirsty for sexually attractive men. You must be ugly.
<comment>
Sorry anon but you are wrong. Women are not subtle at all. My theory is they experience sexual attraction so rarely that it completely overwhelms their higher level thinking abilities. Wjen I was friends with some legitimately attractive guys, the most common pickup line women used on them daily was "come fuck me, please." They did not play any games because if they did, one of the hundreds others listing after theses guys would steal their attention.
Women will not risk being subtle if Chad is at stake.

Get pulled over by a female cop? Then she'll 'approach' you, I guess.

This is true and why women chase famous men hard. Women can't afford to play coy with a real alpha who has options. The main reason why most men have to approach first is because they aren't high value enough to make women compete for them.
<comment>
I see zero reason in approaching a woman first as a sexualy submissive man, I filter compatibility based of if they were alpha enough to make the first move and ask me out, if so it's much more likely she's dominant.
A lot of women consider stuff like merely looking at you and twirling her hair to be a move, or randomly adding you on social media and liking your posts, personally I find this to be low effort bait and Ignore them which has resulted in accusations of being gay. 
Honestly I'd rather be single forever then assume the traditional male role.

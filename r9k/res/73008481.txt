It seems somewhat evil that so many countries call up their boys at random to be murdered by boys of another country. Among other things, this violates the laws that many countries have drawn up against slavery, and that's before we even get into the fact that these kids are being murdered. But no, it doesn't matter, they're male, so we can just let them die, hahahaa. If you're not born with a vagina, you can just die, hahaha.
This isn't egalitarian, this isn't progressive, this isn't fair, and you FUCKING KNOW IT.

People are cucked and will always be subservient to the draft so long as the government can sell the war to the public. It only becomes a serious problem when it's blatantly obvious to even the dumbest citizens that something fishy is afoot, like what happened in Vietnam.

would you rather the other side win?
would you rather share a fox hole with a fucking woman?

Because only 1% of US military positions are combat roles and they send the volunteers first. On the extremely low chance that there ever is another draft, and you're exactly 18, you'll get thrown on logistics or janitor or chef duty while the experienced people go to combat.

Getting mad about the draft is a fear that exclusively affects 18 year olds, so, welcome to 4chan

I'm kind of a misandrist so maybe this is my bias speaking but it's probably because a good chunk of moids are still romanticizing war and nationalism and protecting women and children and other such ideals, so they don't think it's a problem in the first place, and the rest are just too incompetent at social engineering to create a movement speaking out against this stuff. Meanwhile women have always been good at organizing to support each other so it's no surprise they have a lot of successful social movements under their belt. It would be nice if they did something like that for men too, but it's a lot to expect considering they aren't directly affected by it. I'm sure a lot of them would pledge their support if a movement were to already exist, but yeah as you can imagine I have no idea how to do something like that either considering I'm on /r9k/.

men still cucking for their country when it so obviously hates them
what a surprise

what you are referring to is called revolution. When military age men are not satiated by society they will no longer pledge loyalty to the state. Funky stuff ensues

homeschooled
don't live in a college town or big city
straight to wageslaving in a warehouse
I completely missed out on having a youth. I have zero friends. There is nowhere to go and nothing to do. It's over.
Just go to uni?
went to tiny private school
whenever we went on field trips or did anything outside of school like dances we included a bunch of home school students/families that were all registered as part of the same "school"
more home school families should team up like that
it really made a difference for them
with what money. To study what? Because I was homeschooled I had zero scholarships. I went to a CC for a little bit and even got an honors scholarship but that covered like barely 1/4 of one semester at a uni
kill yourself asshole im not doing that
save money
flee to poor country
if you're already a third worlder then you're fucked
I did homeschool after 8th grade. I should've kept playing sports, that way I would've had friends and a social life.
It's ok man there's nothing wrong with not having friends or not having some period in your youth where you wasted your time not getting money anyways. You're gonna be ok bro just keep stacking money and one day you'll have nothing to worry about.

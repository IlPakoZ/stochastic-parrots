I got a little gynecomastia taking finasteride. Stopped for 2 months and it still hasn't gone down. Should I jump back on fin and at least save my hairline, or can my boobies get even worse?
<comment>
only way to escape male pattern baldness is taking a drug that'll feminize you
lmao I feel bad for baldies
<comment>
it still hasn't gone down
It's real breast tissue, anon. It's not gonna go away and yes it could get worse.
<comment>
so even becoming extra lean and muscley won't save me?
<comment>
. I ordered herbal estrogen supplements to give myself breast tissue, two weeks ago I was in the pool and my dad asked if I had been working out
<comment>
no, you're gonna have to have the breast buds removed both to get rid of the growth and to prevent anymore if you stay on fin
<comment>
stfu faggot, how does estrogen boobies look like you've been working out? You AND your dad are faggots
Can I get a sneak peek of those milkers, baby?
Fuck, I shouldn't have listened to all those dudes on tressless downplaying the sides and saying it's a vocal minority. I was bulking when taking fin, so I didn't really notice it was gynecomastia until it was too late

First, I'm sorry. Secondly, it depends on your skull. Why not try shaving your head and seeing how women react.
The onions look is only onions on ugly men; if you're attractive if your skull is big, androgenic, well proportioned and manly, then JustShaveIt tm is sound advice, as your ability to get laid will not be affected. If not however, I suggest the contrary. Hair will prevent you suffering. 
I myself am on finasteride if that is any credential.
True. These are factual. Google it. Cases of gyno can become permanent features of your body.
Just do men and incels a favor and DON'T go spreading misinformation about finasteride. It works overwhelmingly with no side affects. You were misfortune.
I do have an idea. Theory even. Because the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors increase testosterone, incidentally that testosterone will aromatise into oestrogen. I believe that if some man has low testosterone, on the cusp of what might produce boobs or gyno, that extra oestrogen could be the push to do it.
There's no way to write this without causing offense, but do you look low T / unattractive facially?
I am just phoning the reaper. You guys need a visit from Mr. Norwood or Mr. rope, faggots.

Sorry dude, sometimes when you take a risk you roll a one; good luck in the future
<comment>
i take dutasteride and drink booze everyday but i still coom 4 times a day and have no tits 
wtf skill issue
<comment>
Take 60-120mgs ralox for a couple weeks, and or 40mg nolvadex
<comment>
How long were you on it?
Also how long have you been on fin? My hair has ony been getting worse and it's been almost five months. Standard dose.
<comment>
You were misfortune
but that is my reality and the only thing that matters to me now that the misfortune happened. I literally listened to stuff like this from tressless before deciding I should jump on fin and now I'm in my situation.
There's no way to write this without causing offense, but do you look low T / unattractive facially?
No problem. I don't look effeminate and I've always been toned and athletic before I hit the gym. I'm quite tall and do get looks from a few women every now and again. I don't know about my t levels though. I have been taking diindolylmethane on and off since stopping fin, as I heard that helps estrogen balance and was hoping it would reduce my little boobies.

Sorry, mate. You sound fucked. Shitty situation that I will never experience.
In answer to your question, I first started taking it on 21st of June 2021, about 6 months after I first noticed I was loosing hair. In my diary I wrote something about my prostate feeling strange and my cum being watery for the first week. And it took me 45 minutes to get my first erection after first beginning to take the medication. I think I fapped to something on /gif/.
I'm due to take my next tablet tomorrow. Along with a Xanax probably. Fuck waging.
<comment>
Is there a pill that makes you bald and get rid of your bitch tits?
<comment>
Sounds like there is still hope for me.
How long were you on it?
about 6 months
<comment>
How long did it take for you to notice new hair growth? Did you shed?
<comment>
go down
it mostly will not "go down" besides losing volue due to less blood flow etc. Gyno doesn't shrink with hormones. It's inert after stopping growing, just sits there. Needs to be cut out.
Converting testosterone to DHT is something that competes with aromatizing testosterone into estrogen. So if you have a lot of body fat you might not want to try finasteride before you slim down.

I'm asian and thin at 5'7 and 130lbs. I just live with gyno. I have never had balding.
<comment>
I was starting to leave NW1 when I noticed and rectified it. I must have been NW1.4 if there were such precision and a defined measure.
I shed for the first 6 weeks. I was extremely depressed and got sacked from my postal job, because I thought it was going to be prematurely OVER for me. It was progressively slowing, the rate I was losing hair until 6 weeks later it reversed and I saw the hair I had lost over the last 6 months come back wispy and weak initially, but they became progressively stronger and like I had remembered from my earlier years. 
Now I am back to a NW1. I've been playing with my dosage and frequency I take the tablets. They are 1mg and individually packaged. I get the generic stuff, because I'm not paying out the ear for some greedy faggot to reduce the shelf life and repackage it.
Today I take one 1mg tablet every three days, and only need to refresh my supply twice a year, well unless something changes, like maybe I get killed oh please.
<comment>
Take a dose of letrozole. It's an arometase inhibitor which will reduce your bitch tits. Originally it's a meditation for breast cancer.
<comment>
How do you know if you have fat, muscle, or gladular tissue?
<comment>
Depends how bad it is. Dont listen to the 16 year old chuds on this board (almost every poster). I have been on finasteride myself 10 years. Hairline remained steady since then
Basically if you stay on fin you will remain your hairline, most likely. Might even recover a bit. Add in minox for more recovery.
The sinkers are knowing that fin might make you more depressed. This is somethign most fin users try to dismiss but remember most fin users are depressed idiots that will barely recognise this drop in life vigour. But it does happen. Taking fin will probably make you lose a bit of zest for life
If your life consists of going to meetings and doing shit. Fin is for you. If your life consists of you needing to do complex things that needs an 'alpha' mindset self starter stuff like running a business fin might ruin your life
All in all if you want to get a wife, staying on fin will probably help you. But remember you WILL go bald and when you quit fin you WILL go bald very fast. You cant have kids on fin itll make them retarded
All in all, fin = YES if you do some job that is simply reacting to your superior and you want to secure a mate. get gyno surgery in the meantime. If you need to do hard shit that requires big time thinking go bald and try to rise above and become a big time chad through social connections
<comment>
Holy fuck, man. Get surgery. If you can't afford that, at least wear baggier shirts.
<comment>
Fuck I hope my shed is just temporary and I recover. I was NW2 when I began but now I'm turning into a 3
<comment>
Idk if this looks worse when I am shirtless? I was made fun of since I had a cousin that was flat. Probably cause my mom is like D cup
<comment>
i've read that the corrective surgery for gyn is only a couple thousand bucks, might wanna look into it
<comment>
I want to suck and nibble on those
<comment>
wtf???? taking finesteride makes u bald more?? it makes u shed?? kinda fucking bullshit is this??
<comment>
Some people apparently lose a lot of their weakened hair before growing it back. Others don't. Maybe I'll get the hair I lost back, maybe I won't. I was going to lose it anyway so it was worth a try.
<comment>
I got gyno from fin as well. and i also stopped for a few months but it didnt go down.
been on it for about 3 years now and it hasnt gotten worse at least. It's not really that noticeable and on cold days its basically non existent, but nonetheless I'm still insecure if I'm not wearing a sweater or a tight tank top under my t shirt.
I've been thinking about gyno surgery, but idk if the gyno will come back if i keep taking fin afterwards.
I've wanted to try this out, went to my doctor for it but he said ralox is mostly for women, so he wont prescribe it. also idk if i have to keep taking it indefinitely as long as i take fin
<comment>
Isnt there something better than fin that you can use who is not maybe as effective but more harmless?
<comment>
did you take an aromatase inhibitor with it? that would have prevented this.
<comment>
What do you guys think about shit like Nutrafol? It seems expensive so I haven't tried it but it seems like it has good reviews
<comment>
just lean into it and take estrogen

I just don't have the energy to off myself anymore. Things arent going well though, Ive been self medicating to the point of physical addiction and now my safety crutch is about to be pulled out from under me (doc no longer wants to prescribe me diazepam which I use to taper from stronger benzos).
Im also just legitimately sick this week so that hasnt been fun.

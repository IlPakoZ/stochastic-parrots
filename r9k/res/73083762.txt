What keeps you going, anon? I know that one day I will be free. That's what does it for me.
my faith in God and my love for music.
Secular music is a sin
my desperate wish to be a cute girl
God, my love for Math and loads of pent-up rage.
Spite and curiosity mostly. And not wanting to leave a mess.
I love math too, I want to learn how to do cool shit
I live because I make the world a slightly worse place
I just don't have the energy to off myself anymore. Things arent going well though, Ive been self medicating to the point of physical addiction and now my safety crutch is about to be pulled out from under me (doc no longer wants to prescribe me diazepam which I use to taper from stronger benzos).
Im also just legitimately sick this week so that hasnt been fun.
imagine if Jesus killed himself, if i was in his shoes I definitely would want to. but imagine the consequences of that. maybe all this suffering is a test and god has big plans for me.
no it is not lol. origami
The friends I made on here, funny enough.
Jesus Christ and my family and pets
im confident that this depression will pass and my t levels will be in the high 800s again. I will get back in the gym and become the man im supposed to be.
THE SUNSET AND THE SUNRISE!

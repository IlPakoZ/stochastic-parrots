turned 27 virgin last week
no friends multiple years
just work, home, work, home, work, home over and over again
somehow had a date from the apps last week
she rightfully thought I was super weird, it went awful
pretty much lost all hope at this point, don't really care about anything anymore positive or negative
how's life going for you my fellow oldanons
turned 28 this year
cousin I have not seen in years calls out of the blue to offer me a job
decide to start a garden and start growing some potatoes
coworkers genuinely like me and think I am funny and invite me out to lunch or just to hang
fat assed Indian girl at work flirts with me and wants to take me on a date 
steady paycheck means I can actually buy things I want instead of what I only need
start going to the gym and lose thirty pounds
For the first time in ages I am happy and the worst part is I know something is going to happen that ruins it all so I am torn between wanting to enjoy it and preparing for the worst
decide to start a garden and start growing some potatoes
based everything else too though. good job anon
33
I jerk off to hentai doujins and hentai cunny instead of talking to holes 
Honestly, I think I've made the right decision. Women are garbage and should be phased out.
33 and just keep writing the same stories out with an AI, gives a brief hit of dopamine and doesn't expect me to do his laundry &amp; cook for him
could be worse
26
wake up
stare at my computer screen for what feels like 15 minutes
its already 8pm
i've started drinking for the first time in my life by myself because it helps me not feel miserable.
trying to engage in hobbies again too.
are you gay or grill. for some reason the idea of a 33 year old girl having to find love from an ai is somehow sadder than a 33 year old guy having too
yeah. being addicted to the internet is like living your life on fast forward, but the tape is just a loop of the same scene over and over

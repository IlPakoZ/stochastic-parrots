Your 15-30 are supposed to be the peak of your life, when you live life to the fullest, go out, make friends, experience, have fun. But I'm 22 and I'm stuck in a shitty life. I haven't felt true happiness in years, I don't even have actual memories of the last years except my room and this fucking website. I'd give anything to have a group of friends, a girlfriend, go out with them, fight with them, become mature, live a fucking normal youth.

Where do you live? I'm in California, USA and literally just enjoy walking around outside alone. I'm usually online when home, but almost every day I spend 3-6 hours outside with no computer or phone,

15: teen years, shit, depressed, no friends and bullied at school
18 - 20: college suffering and burnout, highschool 2.0
20 - 24: suffering and humiliating wagie job, my entire monthly pay is less than the cost of rent. 
25 - 30: joined military, start back at 0 as nothing and at the level of 17 year olds. Do three deployments. Somehow, end up being competent enough to fast track to SSG.
30-32: Get out because I'm not happy, get a job as night shift security at a potato chip factory and am pending 100% disability 
I'll go full NEET whenever I can. It doesn't get better.

Next year I'll be 30 with no motive in life still. So I am with you there.

same. i said this in another thread but i believe i can be happier i can escape my parents and live on my own. then i could go to bars and possibly bring girls over, and even if not i can still hire escorts to come to my room.

it's still very frustrating... when I was younger I always thought things would get better as I aged, I'd naturally become outgoing, make friends, but I guess I was fucking wrong.
I'm Western European. There is literally no suffering in America, y'all are naturally born outgoing and you have wonderful weather. You're lucky, I wish I was born there.

I'm shy, introverted and autistic. No ever believes I was actually born and raised in Cali

i knew it was over when i was a freshman in high school i was constantly bullied in middle school and i suspect that was the reason why i have severe trust issues and never let anyone get close
i also knew from a young age that adult friendships never really last and everyone is only concerned about themselves so once i started working i never tried to be friends with my coworkers and they never tried to be friends with me
honestly its whatever i feel that even if i did have friends it would be too exhausting to put any effort into maintaining a friendship

I fucked my life up before it even began.

Get out because I'm not happ
damn I feel you, you can even be doing good professionally but inside you're just dead. It never even began for us..
Maybe you're a normalfag who you could actually pull girls, but I live alone and it's just fucking over. Escorts are a money sink and no matter how much you see them they'll never feel like like an actual girlfriend, they're just expensive cum drainers.
i knew it was over when i was a freshman in high school
Personally I actually a decent high school life, that's why I still held hope and wrongly believed I could make it. But when I went to university reality slapped me hard..

I feel this 100%, I used to try and make friends with the people in my university but now I've just given up, I've been through so many "friendships" that I don't even have the energy to get invested in someone anymore.

as if shit wasn't hard enough by default for fellas like us i can add being a known alcoholic to the mix. never sharing a late night beer with anyone 100% guaranteed. at best i can bond with a bunch of brainlet drug addicts or old ass alchies who had families before drinking them away. noticed TV sitcoms often have actors leave the corks off liquor bottles on purpose so sticklers will pay attention to the bottle.

it is what it is
but talking to strangers on here is really the only social interaction i have nowadays

i watched two and a half men where he has to take care of his gf when shes sick and all i could think about was how much i'd love to care for a gf like that.
<comment>
its weird. i have former classmates who are bald already, worked in stores since leaving school or just neeted their entire adult life. guys addicted to speed and one guy had two separate rape accusations.
yet somehow i'm the biggest loser of them all.

You're still young as hell get a grip or one day you'll be 30 and wishing you had tried more in the past, and then you'll be 40 and thinking the same thing, on and on.

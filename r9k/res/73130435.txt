Women are basically men but with boobs, butts, lower pitch voice and vagina. Very disturbing, women needs to be more of a different species and more mysterious. If they are so similar in the head as men, it starts to feel very gay. In old times they simulated the mysteriousness and other-speciesmess with social roles to cope with the fact that fucking them feels gay but there's no simulation now. These men-lites are walking, talking, doing all sorts of jobs, getting degrees and arguing like men, it's all very very gay. Very gay.

Over the time of the several past months I have become dependend on alcohol to cope with everything. I plan on roping too. My parents do me the favor and give me the money for the alc, since I have ran out of money long time ago. Due to me not leaving the house often, my parents buy me the alcohol themselves now. The problem here is that they see the alcohol as my main problem itself, instead of just a stupid coping mechanism for other problems. I do not want that my parents feel responsible for me roping in that way. What do you think?

If you're going to be an alcoholic use it to get laid. Assuming you've not drunk yourself in to obesity yet that is. Go to the city on Friday/Saturday nights, enter one of the free night clubs and get drunk there. Concerts are also a great place for this too.
You will need to sneak your alcohol in a lot of the time unless you want to pay absurd prices for drinks. It isn't even hard. Get a small bag for your poison of choice and wear it under your clothes when you're entering.
Then you have sex and might enjoy yourself.

I think the problem is you have all this free time. If you were doing things instead of drinking it might be beneficial. Just slowly reduce your intake and become a narcissist like everyone else

You're probably 30 tops? Listen anon, you do not want to experience true alcoholism. It's a slow descent into an infantile form of life. Granted, its going to take a couple of decades to really destroy you, but when it does it gets ugly.

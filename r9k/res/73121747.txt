This will sound stupid, but women literally only care how you make them feel. It's literally that simple. Do not overthink it
<comment>
yeah, and you need to be chad to make them feel truly good.
<comment>
Okay, what does that change about anything? Hot attractive guys with good social skills make them feel good, fat virgin NEET autists make them feel bad.
<comment>
yeah no shit retard they want to feel attracted to a man and women are only attracted to tall height and handsome face you dumb bimbo whore.
social skills are irrelevant. its all height and face genetics.
<comment>
i love women coming here to deboonk the blackpill and just getting demolished entirely and against their will (hot)
<comment>
What difference does that make? I clearly don't make them feel good.
<comment>
The point it, feeling is more subjective than you retards realize, especially for women. You constantly rag on women for being retarded, but don't realize that also applies to how they feel attraction. Literally just personalitymaxx you fucking retards
<comment>
just fuck right off with that personality bs pl0x
<comment>
the best advice you can give people here is to not bother with women. that the majority aren't worth their pain time or effort and that they should pursue things that make them happy.
<comment>
This. They feel good if you are tall, handsome, fit, have a large cock, have money and drugs and high social status. It's really that simple.
<comment>
Le epic tranny gif anon1! Look in the fucking mirror, and I don't mean your face. 
Women are a whole bunch of trouble, but usually it's worth figuring it out. This board defines itself with its misery and usually the number one complaint is a lack of romantic success
<comment>
Yes and you only make them feel good things if you are attractive.
If you are ugly you make them feel bad things.
<comment>
This will sound stupid, but women literally only care how you make them feel
and they will feel like absolute shit everytime they look at your face or body. they will get a sinking feels of anxiety and depression when they see how ugly you are, unless you look like this
<comment>
Okay explain to us how this gentlemen can pull a 6'1 blonde 9/10 white 23 year old who makes 200k a year by making her feel good.
<comment>
nt and dark triad, most likely. also im sure the white girl has a fetish for blacks
<comment>
Cope 
The guy is probably dark triad, has an online following (status that women value), and she has a humiliation fetish. You have to remember that women are retarded
<comment>
This board defines itself with its misery and usually the number one complaint is a lack of romantic success
yeah, and they are wrong sadly. im not saying can't be great but they are not worth figuring it out. the dudes here should focus on strengthening or getting relationships with male friends. also focus on goals, or things that are attainable and bring them joy. women do not want to be the primary reason for a persons happiness, they hate that shit. all that will do is make these men feel worse about themselves which sucks since they are already miserable as is.
<comment>
* im not saying women can't be great
<comment>
women do not want to be the primary reason for a persons happiness
That's true, but that doesn't mean having a gf can't make someone happy, especially if they are romantically starved. There's a reason the number one ingredient most anons have in 'making it' is finally getting a gf or at least having sex. Recognizing how important romantic success is to happiness isn't the same as idealizing women or simping
<comment>
Recognizing how important romantic success is to happiness isn't the same as idealizing women or simping
Honestly I think its overblown, I'm a 30 yo hhkv and it never stopped me from enjoying life.
<comment>
You have a very different life experience to most anons then. The number one complaint of miserable anons most of the time is a lack of romantic success. Even asexual anons hate that they can't have that
<comment>
never said it can't male someone happy, just that it's not worth the effort. women are not worth it 9/10 times just like men aren't. the people here really have no clue how annoying or stressful a relationship can be. this again, applies to both genders, but is harder for men. dudes simply don't get as many opportunities on average as women in the west. the difference is actually laughable. they should focus on what i said and on their family as well. if a women comes along and is worth their time, great. chasing girls, changing themselves to get one and continuing the act is exhausting and most times not worth the rto. women are not special, billions of them are on this planet just like men.
<comment>
You're not wrong, but you're imagining a relationship where the guy is essentially an actor to maintain attraction. I'm not saying anons should so that. They should become the best version of themselves, which is kind of what you're suggesting via getting their shit together, then find a girl they have legitimate synergy with. Personality synergy is massively underrated, especially here, in terms of having a happy and fulfilling relationship
<comment>
its really something you need to experience. guys need to feel like what you are doing is right to only get rugpulled in the feefees like this.
<comment>
If I'd just authentically BEE MYSELF I would end up crying in front of the girl and that would ruin the relationship. You have to be an actor. If you cry in front of your girl her respect for you GOES DOWN no matter what you think
<comment>
guys need to feel like what you are doing is right to only get rugpulled in the feefees like this
You're not wrong. One of the biggest wakeup calls of my life was doing all the 'right things' to a girl I liked and having it backfire terribly. Sadly all the feminist horseshit that young boys are brainwashed with means such a negative experience is inevitable for millions of boys and men, many of them never realize the delusion they were under since they are either mentally weak and/or heavily conditioned, others become embittered. Ironically women also suffer indirectly from this because feminism trains men to act in ways which they don't find attractive. Contemporary feminism is a scourge to humanity
<comment>
They should become the best version of themselves,
im not suggesting that at all. im not saying self improve or any of that bs. im litearlly saying these men should just do what makes them happy. find people who are reliable, (hopefully strong male relationships as it's far easier) focus on their family (mom, dad, siblings, cousins young and old etc.) and pursue shit that makes them happy (could be learning an instrument, going to concerts, sports or the gym. literally could be learning to cook meals they enjoy to feed themselves or their loved ones. maybe it's growing a garden or some other thing) just forget women as they literally most times aren't worth shit. i wish these men would realize this instead of being angry and bitter about not having a polished turd. i want to make sure im clear, this applies to both genders with regards to romantic success who are disadvantaged. if shit was easy, maybe pursue it then. i know enough good looking dudes who don't bother with them, even when they have women throwing themselves at them. same shit applies to hot girls too so some truth to what i say has to be there.
<comment>
It's not a binary between bee urself or be an actor. Self monitoring is a gray scale, not a binary. Not to mention the more emotionally stable and successful you become, the less emotional distress you'll be under. 
Not self monitoring at all is not the same thing as beeing urself, this is one of the most common fallacies. Even Chads and normies self monitor, in fact many of them do it a lot (too much imo). 
That's the next best thing if you can't or don't want a romantic relationship. You sound more bitter and jaded than aromantic or asexual. Don't project your bitterness onto other people or convince them that one of the parts of life with the most potential for happiness and fulfillment is a waste of time. Love is worth pursuing, even if it can be painful or end poorly
<comment>
You have to be an actor
I agree. Notice how women will drop a guy over the smallest mistake, men have no choice but to mold themselves into the model that women find most attractive. There is some degree of flexibility, but generally its a game of playing your part right like an actor and not making any mistakes with your lines.
<comment>
cut the shit with projecting and whatever other buzzwords you want to use. im literally telling dudes here to try to be happy here by pursuing things they have more control over and are reliable (on average to be fair). focusing their efforts on friends, family and hobbies is not harmful. i even mention that if someone comes along, great. you are suggesting they do things dependent on a girls happiness which is terrible advice.
<comment>
generally its a game of playing your part right like an actor and not making any mistakes with your lines.

<comment>
Most of your advice is good except for the part about giving up on romance and girls, which is egregiously bad advice. Being fatalist or having a hands off attitude towards something that significant is a recipe for suffering, especially because most anons are passive and not attractive. You'll argue this is exactly why they should give up, because that is where we fundamentally disagree
<comment>
This. if you arent hot she will feel the ick. if you are hot she will feel horny. simple
<comment>
which is egregiously bad advice. Being fatalist or having a hands off attitude towards something that significant is a recipe for suffering,
this is where i actually agree with you. without happiness or people, live is not worth living. you believe that the pinnacle of this is found in a relationship with a partner. that nothing on earth can compare and that a person should slave away their existence to this. i think it's foolish and that you should let it come into your life if it's someone special.
<comment>
*live is not worth living.
life is not worth living.

Yes and I make them feel uncomfortable. Next thread.

They won't feel safe with a guy that's shorter than them.

you make up stupid shit like this but the reality is any fat and short guy would make you "feel" bad and a tall lean man would make you "feel" good
feel free to prove me wrong, but we both know you won't
You are shallow, and you can't lie to yourself about that or to robots about it, that shit does not fly here. If the stuff you were saying was true, none of us would be here.

everyone knows this already you retard except the part you're leaving out is that the only way to make a woman feel good is to be physically attractive to them
<comment>
eh, at least an effort was made.
<comment>
Over for long-term cels who can't feel anything, thus cannot communicate good feelings to women.
<comment>
Okay sure. But here's my problem: I'm not good enough looking for women to give me the chance to show them my personality. I can't make them feel good when they won't even get to know me.
<comment>
Be prepared for a legion of KHHV incels to insist they know more about women than anyone else alive, ever.

The ones you guys never read? With the statistics you prove you don't understand? Maybe you'll post the trash OKCupid charts like they have meaning, again, and not know why people with an education mock you for it?
Or maybe you'll spend 300 posts screeching that the data sets from the GSS, Census, Pew, and OSFS all have to be faaaaaaake because it disagrees with you?
You mean that laughable stuff, where half the studies posted on the front page of the scientific blackpill page prove the blackpill *wrong* but Blackpillers can't figure that out?

Females will never understand how it feels to just go unnoticed for years straight
<comment>
I'm pretty sure we do read them and understand them. It's pretty easy to scroll down and read the conclusion. You don't have an education, you only seethe because you're wrong. It's quite simple. In essence you're like an Afro American claiming to be educated. 
Here's just one example: In general, women prefer men taller than themselves and, conversely, men prefer women shorter than themselves [11], [24]-[26]. Again, preferences are reflected in pairings as the male-taller norm is also found in actual couples. Gillis and Avis (1980) found that in only 1 out of 720 US/UK couples, the female was taller
Now, tell me how the study is wrong, you're super smart after all.
<comment>
I'm not saying its other people's problem, I know I'm the common denominator. I'm just pointing out that women aren't willing to talk to people as ugly as me. I've improved the areas I can, but hasn't helped.
<comment>
That is stupid everyone only cares about how they feel
<comment>
Like these studies?
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X14000210
Non-survey, no women or men were asked for their preferences. Shows that women far prefer a plain or ugly man with a good personality to a handsome but boring man.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22329089/
To women facial appearance and height are much less important than social status, self-confidence, and personality
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26655646/
Only the ugliest 10% and handsomest 5% of teenaged boys noticed any difference in sexual behavior In adulthood facial appearance only mattered for the men in poor health
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29534596/
Self-confidence, personality, determine a man's sexual success, not his facial attractiveness
Go on - read them. See how (unlike almost all scientific blackpill studies) few are surveys of women's opinion.

Yes, absolutely true. A majority of women exhibit a preference for taller men, and so on.
But it is not all women. And it is not absolute. 
tell me how the study is wrong, you're super smart after all
Sure!
Gillis and Avis, from 42 years ago, did not have access to better data.
The study mention here
https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-its-so-rare-for-a-wife-to-be-taller-than-her-husband/272585/
And found here
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054186
Which directly references Gillis and Avis, BTW, shows that in the UK a hair over 4% of couples have the woman taller than the man.
1 in 24, not 1 in 720.
Other studies, easily accessed from the main article as links, also show that somewhere between 1 in 12 and 1 in 24 couples have a taller woman.
Not NEARLY as dire, is it?
So tell me - WHY are you referring to a 42 year old study that has been superseded by much more recent ones?
Is the source you are getting them from cherry picking them?
<comment>
But you haven't tries to talk to a woman in 7 years, how would you know?

I helped those guys.
But when the hard-core, afraid-of-their-own-shadow, refuses-to-talk-to-women-for-seven-years, "all women only wants 6'9" tall guy with a meter long dick" crowd starts crying like little bitches because the truth means they might have to talk to girls?

nah, you are lying. this is not helping others and you know it. im not saying this as them being a lost cause or anything, but your methods are of someone being kind. everyone knows that this isn't the way to approach someone who is hurt or misguided. instead being welcoming and approaching them and providing them with a safe and loving environment. you admit to loving and i quote " the autistic screeching, the malding, the coping, the sething,". no person who wants to genuinely help would enjoy these reactions from someone lost. instead they would show actual concern and compassion. you don't have to do shit for any of these people anon, you do you. please, just don't like and say your reasons are good.

You try to mock and insult someone for not understanding context? You realize that anon and anybody else in this thread are talking about the after effects of doing what was considered the "right things" to keep a girl happy? That is talking about women it would only be logical to think about women. Are you unwell?
<comment>
Sure dude I fear the promiscuous "cis male" that's trying to hard.
<comment>
this is not helping others and you know it
Bulshit.
The Blackpill boils down to
Give up
Watch how blackpillers will spend three straight days and 500 posts screaming like angry chimps in self-improvement posts. How blackpillers try to tear down anyone saying they had any success with women, or attack anyone with hope of romantic success. It is the Cult of Sour Grapes, the Bucket of the Crab King.
your methods are of someone being kind. everyone knows that this isn't the way to approach someone who is hurt or misguided. instead being welcoming and approaching them and providing them with a safe and loving environment.
Let's look at how I started, shall we?
Just facts. Anyone can go read the facts.
More simple facts.
Notice the absence of engagement with those facts. The replies are about *me*.
Including this one
Probably by you.
I bet cash you never opened any of those studies, you immediately focused on ME and tried to paint ME as "bad".
Why?
Because then *you* don't have to grow and change.
no person who wants to genuinely help would enjoy these reactions from someone lost.
Why not?
If your goal is to save innocent people from idiots, fools, and demoralizers you know you are doing well when the idiots, fools, and demoralizers are pissed off at you. The fact that blackpillers froth at the mouth at my posts and talk about me *instead of the facts* tells me they can't refute anything.
It tells everyone else that, too,
Replies like yours prove to obverses that you have no ability to refute facts but must instead attack me.
It is funny because it is an admission that you already lost, but you lack the insight to know that.
<comment>
I am still listening to the voices in my head, not what you wrote
FTFY
I cannot read minds so I have *no fucking idea* what a rando on 4chan means when he says he "did all the right things".
SO I ASKED WHAT HE MEANT.
The fact *you* are so stupid you think this is a defense of women tells me you are retarded.

<comment>
if it was about genetics then you would have the exact same success as your dad.
<comment>
Didn't expect this thread to blow up, I'll quickly break down the main things I think matter in how you make a woman feel... 
looks 
This one is self explanatory, and most robots are well aware of this to the point that they overly harp on it, every person who wants love should looksmaxx. Before you get bitter and screech 'that isn't love', do you imagine an ugly girl when you think of love? 
personality 
This is the element that robots egregiously underestimate. Due to a combination of mental illness, poor mentality, external locus of control, bitterness etc. many robots have completely dogshit personalities. THIS is the real reason most robots are alone. Before oyu seethe and sperg out, I'm not saying that the average robot is good or even average looking. I'm saying that after you've looksmaxxed, the only thing realistically left in your control after that is personality, which is much more powerful than most anons realize. Most are too anxious to let go of their self defeating mentality though and would rather stay in their safe space which tells them the only thing that matters is something they have little to no control over. 
status/money 
This one is pretty self explanatory, should be pretty self explanatory. I'd caution against heavily leaning on this and against totally ignoring it.
<comment>
Replies like yours prove to obverses that you have no ability to refute facts but must instead attack me.
It is funny because it is an admission that you already lost, but you lack the insight to know that.
i genuinely don't care about winning or losing, you do. if you want me to say i lost, have at it. anon, i lost and what you say is the truth. 
If your goal is to save innocent people from idiots, fools, and demoralizers you know you are doing well when the idiots, fools, and demoralizers are pissed off at you.
that is a really poor method to measure success. again, this is what you enjoy and what gets your rocks off. you have the right to live your life however you want.
<comment>
This. Women tend to like men with chill and confident personalities. Especially chill. Meanwhile, being MEGA neurotic is the most common robot personality trait, that's the opposite of being chill/being fun to be around.
<comment>
Freindo, I was here long before the get on the floor stories. I remember when /r9k/ was mainly humor and decent advice for young men on how to get a GF. I was the guy that started the beta uprising posts (true story).
It was the invsion of shills for PUA and Game that ruined the place. The transformation from good humor, good camaraderie, and creativity was when the shills started dropping redpill threads every 4 hours, then it was the anti-improve threads every day, and now if you try to start a GBP or infinite apartment or tendies thread it dies because everyone is busy screeching about how their dick is only 152mm, not 153mm so they will die alone.
<comment>
I've looksmaxed and increased my wealth considerably, the issue I have is that women never give me the chance to show them my personality. I am confident that if I got the opportunity that I could get a gf, but so far zero women have been willing to get to know me.
<comment>
i genuinely don't care about winning or losing
This isn't about winning or losing, fool.
it is about truth or lies.
I present the truth. You refuse to look and instead insist I must be "bad".
You're throwing yourself into the fire and calling me names for trying to pull you out.
<comment>
it doesnt really matter if you were here before the virgin phase. This board produced the most OC, the best community, and the most fun moments when it was misogyny and greentext. Im not going to read your post because i've read countless revisionist bullshit that your kind likes to spew
<comment>
t. I haven't tried to talk to a woman in over a year
right?
<comment>
Looksmaxxer guys generally forget that if your face is ugly/average, you'll remain ugly/average. 
Most likely you're just going for women out of your own league, you can only blame yourself for failure considering that.
<comment>
This. Women tend to like men with chill and confident personalities. Especially chill. Meanwhile, being MEGA neurotic is the most common robot personality trait, that's the opposite of being chill/being fun to be around.
You summed it up much better than I could. Neuroticism is the number one trait among robots which dries pussies up. It makes women feel even more unsafe than being with a guy shorter than them, that's why they have such an intense reaction of disgust against it. Many robots also confuse neuroticism with sensitivity, they are probably somewhat correlated, but there's a difference between opening up to a woman like a retard, and opening up to her in a realistic and chilled way
<comment>
I try to talk to them, they dont talk to me
Unattractive women aren't willing to talk to me either.

Full details of the last three times you tried
<comment>
Yep. but some of them I can't blame because it's not always simply genetic, that kind of personality also happens as a result of abuse and bullying. It's much easier to appear chill if you had supportive parents who gave you a healthy sense of self-worth, just an example.
<comment>
No worries. I, too, miss when /r9k/ was the gold standard of 4chan
<comment>
Very true, that's why I still try to help some robots even though they have been severely misled and usually are in intense spirals of self destruction. It makes me feel sick to see happen

Unattractive women aren't willing to talk to me either.
Looks like you're going for unavailable women, where do you approach women? If it's only on dating apps, don't bother to answer.
<comment>
To women facial appearance and height are much less important than social status
Whataboutism.
Self-confidence, personality, determine a man's sexual success, not his facial attractiveness
Nice opinion. Too bad it's not backed by science. You and 
are coping and have no factual data to back any of your claims up.
<comment>
I guess it can't always be fixed haha. I'm in my first relationship right now, and my neuroticism and insecurity issues are slowly destroying it. But I'm trying to get better.
<comment>
why bring up that i lost then if it wasn't irrelevant? i didn't say you were bad because of the truth, why do you keep lying? i literally pointed out how you enjoy making others miserable (something you even admitted and doubled down on) who were already in a pathetic state.
<comment>
I implore you to look up dbdr on YouTube you normies are so far up your ass, you wouldn't know the blackpill if it hit you in the face. You fucks are evil.

Still has yet to refute the claim that women overwhelmingly prefer tall men
Yawn. Link me to another blog maybe?
<comment>
immediate seething
Looks like I was right, try not to be a simp.
<comment>
when I was in college I tried clubs and organizations there. Now I try bars, through hobbies, random places like stores, and yes I use the apps as well.
Basically it always goes one of two ways. They either tell me straightforward that they dont want to talk to me, or they give one word replies which kill the conversation
<comment>
The only worse thing than dying is giving up and living a soulless existence. It's much better to try, potentially fail, and learn for the future than to never leave the nest like so many intensely anxious anons do. The main thing I'd say is that it's better to have a good, sustainable relationship than a great relationship that isn't sustainable or enjoyable since you have to self monitor so hard or because the natuarl synergy isn't strong enough. Not saying that's the case, but that's a mistake I used to make in the past, forcing things under the illusion that more will power automatically meant better results. Sometimes the best course of action is to let a relationship die because there are better girls out there, or at least girls you'd have better synergy with
<comment>
Well, it is true that women can kind of smell desperation/when a guy is somewhere only to try to talk to women. Have you tried to simply befriend a woman? If you have the social skills necessary for that, you should be good to go.
<comment>
I want to be friends with women, but I don't understand how to do this when I can't even get a conversation with them.
<comment>
My point is, women can be pretty defensive around men, so maybe try having a more platonic/less threatening attitude, so they're more likely to open up. I'm not saying it's easy to befriend women as a guy who's on the introverted side and probably not very experienced with women, but it's a good starting point.
<comment>
Bluepillers are the creationists of human psychology.
<comment>
you should go to places if you want to meet women
you shouldn't go to places only to meet women
you need to speak with women to learn how to socialize with them
women smell when you're an asocial sperg and don't want to talk with you due to it
even just being >friend with a woman is going to stay hard for you
but don't give up it's definitively worth it
Normie gaslighting.
<comment>
IT'S LE ATTITUDE
not him but cmon; if you can't even talk to girls because they don't want how can befriend them. its over.
<comment>
If you've never seen the difference between the same person looking like shit and looking approachable/friendly, you probably have autism and are unable to talk anyway.
<comment>
"try to befriend women"
REE NORMIE PROPAGANDA
<comment>
I always like how women can't smell abusers, rapists, killers, psihopats, sociopaths, drug dillers, etc. but they somehow have this ultra sofisticated radars for detecting desperation or if some ugly guy has used the wrong word or something lmao. Normans are sometimes funny.
Is this maybe related to quantum mechanics? maybe women are like quantum particles?
<comment>
I have never got anything out of ever trying to befriend women but humiliation. There's nothing worth winning for me there.
<comment>
Nta, but ironically your biggest problem is how much you want it. You probably don't realize how much of a desperate or overly intense vibe you're giving off. Women can like intensity, but especially if they don't know you well or you don't' have social proof to you, t hen don't know how to interpret intensity in a vacuum since you're an unknown quantity to them. So they usually just play it safe and stay away. Basically imo your biggest problem is your neuroticism, you need to chill and unironically not try as hard to make women like you, and even though that sounds dumb it will probably work better than what you're doing now
<comment>
it's hardly gaslighting when people tell you that there are no shortcuts with social skills. you are a person that hates women but also wants women to love you. you don't have any genuine interest in socializing, but the advice is that you need to have an interest in socializing to get the benefits of socializing (unless you are a chad, but even chad usually enjoys spending quality time with people)
<comment>
you probably have autism and are unable to talk anyway.
I work a job in which I need to be extra social and I'm doing fine so your weak projection is kind of worthless.
If you've never seen the difference between the same person looking like shit and looking approachable/friendly,
I've seen when the ugly guy approaches a girl she looks like shit and then suddendly when attractive Chad approaches the same girl in club she is approachable/friendly. I've seen that plenty of times yes.
<comment>
getting a bj from her like this would be so hot
<comment>
Are you just too dumb to realize that narcissism means one is extremely good at lying and manipulating people, making it easier to deceive others? 
Autism is basically the opposite, having -100 charisma. Much easier to notice than narcissism, sadly.
<comment>
easy! lose fat, gain muscle, get job, done!
<comment>
i work a job
I wasn't asking, retarded autist. 
I've seen something completely irrelevant to what you said
Nice. Are you somehow still single?
<comment>
Whenever normoes get BTFO in these kind of arguments they start using mumbo jumbo terms like vibes, energy, etc. which you can't prove or disprove
It always the same tactics and its so funny lmao
<comment>
And what if I'm an autistic introvert who gets mentally drained when being around people too long?
<comment>
ugly guys who try to creep on girls in Chad's league at a club have less success than the sexually active ugly guys who have an IQ above 30
This is very interesting and proves that it's all about attitude.
<comment>
I wasn't asking, retarded autist.
It was related to your statement that I can't talk anyway you fucking giga retard. That's why I said that my job is basically to be social.
<comment>
Okay but how do I become more welcoming when I never get the opportunity to show any of my personality in the first place? I don't understand what im supposed to do when I can't even get an initial conversation
<comment>
nta, but hope to have enough luck to find someone like you (unlikely), or just accept your situation. life wasn't ever fair.
<comment>
This is very interesting and proves that it's all about attitude.
Sure and it just so happens that ugly guys always have bad attitude although they did the same thing as attractive guys with opposite outcome.
<comment>
Just because you don't understand subconscious dynamics doesn't mean they don't exist or aren't important, especially with women who lean way more heavily on their subconscious than men. 'Vibe' is just normie speak for subconscious
<comment>
POOR WAMEN ARE LE DECEIVED AND MANIPULATED
just lmao you retard
<comment>
mentally drained
This doesn't mean anything. You are a victim of a feedback loop, which can work both ways and you can eventually be mentally drained by spending time alone if you wanted that. That definition of introvert was created by some greedy young whore, and you can still be interested in things that "drain" you. Let's not skip the fact that many of these lonely cuckolds legitimately do not care about women nor trust them, they simply want the physical touch and status of being in a relationship. That can work if you're Goku or Naruto, but sadly you just have to take the L if your not.
<comment>
Just because you don't understand subconscious dynamics doesn't mean they don't exist or aren't important, especially with women who lean way more heavily on their subconscious than men. 'Vibe' is just normie speak for subconscious
yes and their subconscious somehow gets shut down when rapists, killers and drug dealers approach them.
<comment>
You posted about an ugly guy with a shitty attitude having the opposite outcome of someone with the appropriate attitude. There are literally billions of ugly guys who have the right attitude and are not single.
<comment>
Sounds like I would need more info, I think they're not all avoiding you for no reason, it's hard to tell. Maybe next time try asking (in a polite way) something like "women don't seem to be talkative around me, do you have any idea why that happens?" and say that you're just looking for advice. if you get rejected again, that is.
inb4 better looks
Sure, but there could be something else too because plenty of unattractive men have girlfriends.
<comment>

You posted about an ugly guy with a shitty attitude having the opposite outcome of someone with the appropriate attitude
I didn't say anything about le attitude; I just said that I saw two exact same approaches in a club. The ugly guy was shut down and the attractive guy was not. Simple as that.
<comment>
The ugly guy was shut down by someone way out of his league, because he's incapable of understanding boundaries.
<comment>
so women are shallow whores who only like narcissits? At least we can agree on something.
<comment>
if they only liked narcissists then incels wouldn't exist.
<comment>
Both women and men end up dating narcissists, because they tend to have very good social skills, and they're good at deceiving of course.
Now keep seething.
<comment>
I accept your defeat. You fought well my friends :)
<comment>

Oh
<comment>
Maybe next time try asking (in a polite way) something like "women don't seem to be talkative around me, do you have any idea why that happens?"
I'm fucking dying if you seriously consider asking this a good idea
<comment>
I would say these are your last twitches
<comment>
Your mistake is assuming their subconscious has some sort of special intuition or power. A major reason dark triad traits are selected for is because they successfully deceive the subconscious of impressionable women
<comment>
How do you show your great personality that will make her feel something if she ignores you from the start and feels you aren't a human because you are ugly?
<comment>
poor wamen are le deceived again
I feel sorry for those poor creatures.
<comment>
Normies do not seem to enjoy being around me at all, even when I do not mind them. Again, why would I try to give any positive attention to them?
<comment>
Deceive was probably an overgeneralization, but in general women who feel good when they are being flirted with by dark triad men were selected for. How much of that is genuinely being deceived and simply having automatic, positive sexual reactions to interactions with dark triad men is hard to sus out, it's probably some combination of both. The truth is we live in a fucked up and dark world, especially in the past, and what turns women on is a reflection of that
<comment>
Its too late. Im 37.

typical us against them mentality
Trust me, you deserve to be alone. If your whole identity revolves around being a toxic asshole, then commit to it.
<comment>
I don't care about being alone much anymore. "They" have always treated me as less for things I couldn't control, I don't want to be with them.
No company is better than bad company.
<comment>
why are u doing all this mental gymnastics about women being manipulated?
Women are grown up people with reason and functioning brain cells and are capable of making their own decisions.
They are selecting those men beacuse THEY MADE that DECISION THEMSELVES. Not because they were somehow decieved.
I'm not saying men are angels or anything; we are also shallow as fuck but that is another topic.
<comment>
Wow you must be the only person like that on this board!
<comment>
Why are you here normalfag? Go back to /soc/ or /b/.
<comment>
nta. but I mean can you blame someone regardless of gender if they date a person who is secretly married for example? Humans tend to be trustful, especially when it comes to friends/romantic partners, and that's why narcissists do so well in society, they use others and are good at it as well.
<comment>
Same reason as you, fucking moron. Go outside, it's not hard to make friends.
<comment>
Since you mention it rate my park
<comment>
I'm giving them a lot of benefit of the doubt because bitterness is a slippery slope to misery and mistreating the people around you. Giving people the benefit of the doubt opens you up to getting taken advantage of, but also vastly increases the chances of meeting other people who are genuinely good, or are at least trying to be. I'd rather get hurt 100 times to find a good girl than be an emotional coward and close myself off because my ego is too big and misconstrues trust with ignorance. 
There's also this misconception that men and women are the same. If you have the same expectations of women that you have of men, you will inevitably be disappointed. Women have different priorities and find different things attractive than men, they are also under way less environmental pressure in 2023 to be good people than men. Lastly, they are much more susceptible to leaning on and giving into their subconscious than men, both by nature and nurture. I guess I'd rather be made a fool of and eventually find good relationships than let my ego force me into isolation so I can feel superior to other people when in reality I'm just being a massive, selfish pussy
<comment>
I kind of agree with you but I just said that normie tactics is so funny to me.
I just ask myself how on earth is it possible that girls cannot sense when someone is rapist, killer, drug dealer etc. and other shitty personality traits even after months of dating and going out with that person.
On the other hand they can somehow sense when a guy is le desperate on one sentence alone or just by few minutes of his presence in the same room with them.
You can srsly tell me you believe this.
Or you maybe think that traits mentioned above are actually part of a good personality; that's much bigger issue then.

<comment>
Nta, but women are way less empathetic than men, there is a fallacy that they are as or even more empathetic because they have a much stronger nurturing reflex than men. They also don't have to give people the benefit of the doubt because they are so much more likely to 'naturally' get good relationships with the opposite sex, especially in 2023. Basically women suck because they can, both in terms of cultural/hypermodern environment, and because of the evolutionary past shaping their nature differently than men. The fallacy that women have even close to the same level of empathy to men is honestly very dangerous to society in general, especially because they have so much political power now

they have le bad attitude
or
women le sense ther desperation and personality
don't even bother replaying.

Seeing men insist on the "blackpill" being true is so funny because all they do is project their own instincts (physical attractiveness trumps everything) onto women. They are literally incapable of imagining how it would be to not be shallow for one second
<comment>
Bullshit answer, you deflected my question with a question and parroted what I told you back at me when pressed.
Why are you really here? What do you get out of your time on this board?
<comment>
The women in my life have been ice cold bitches, so hopefully I am proven wrong in the future. I suspect empathy for women is more selfishly motivated than for men where it's more reflexive and good natured imho. Men can also shape their empathy to be more effective where women just usually go with their gut, which can backfire, especially in macro settings where instincts shaped in very specific hunter gatherer settings are not as useful
<comment>
Not a bullshit answer. Calm down retard.
<comment>
Why do you deflect even the most basic of questions? Is the english language too complex for your normnigger brain to process?

Half true, personality matters more than women realize. I see a similar fallacy in career women who assume having a successful career should entitle them to similarly attractive men. The vast majority of men only care about looks and personality desu

Men prefer women with big tits

Now male blackpillers will scream this isn't true for HOURS despite the fact that appearance is much more important to men than to women.
Yes, there is a general preference in a slight majority.
You guys act like it is an iron law and death sentence.

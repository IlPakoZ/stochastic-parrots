its funny how americans larp as macho or tough when everyone is more manly stronger and smarter than them. americans are dumber than abbos/braindamaged congolose kids, they are weak and obese so litterally everyone mogs them. its funny and sad being in this shithole of a country i am the only one i know who exercises and eats healthy. 
i am part of a tiny minority of americans who cooks his own meals and exercises daily/lifts weights 4 times a week most americans cant walk they cant have sex because they are too fat and because they are all ugly as sin. i would rather stay a khv than fuck a american woman. all american woman. only thing i can do is just look at europeans and latinoss with envy and rage. they get beautiful women who arent prudish and ugly/obese. i swear we should get all greatful 1st worlders and make them spend a month in the us.

The most eye opening moment for me as a European was a thread with American anons talking about how their moms and dads were so obese they couldnt even walk from the Walmart parking lot to the entrance. Also the article about Americans needing to be taught how to walk for more than 10 steps when visiting European towns and cities because they are so used to just riding in cars. Kek.

happened to me too, I remember being completely repulsed by the idea that your own fucking parents would commit fucking RELIGIOUS GENITAL MUTILATION to their children. I do feel kinda bad for mutts, they either have to cope HARD with shit like "It's ackshually comfortable and beneficial to my health" or "It prevents muh infections" or just live the rest of their lives knowing that they just lost an important part of their body and can never get it back.

eh, depends upon where you go. What you highlighted in your image mainly reflects the south and midwest . You will see more healthy in shape folks in New York and Los Angeles. I have lived in both cities and most people are rather healthy, in LA/OC the only fat people you really encounter are Mexicans.
Where as in Pittsburgh or the detroit metro area, you will see a shit ton more fat people.

The average American doesn't look like this lol I can tell you don't live in America there are a lot of guys here who will smack you just for believing in something other than what they believe in and they are usually leftists.

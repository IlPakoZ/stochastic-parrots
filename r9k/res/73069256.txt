<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
DEEP ROCK GALACTIC anons do you have it??
<comment>
no i dont have it but i could buy it but i need to know where ure from
<comment>
can i come too? played deep rock galactic and didnt quite like it
<comment>
one day i wanna make a skribbl general and everyone can vc and we can all have fun. i can only dream. ive noticed a lot of bots are hesitant to vc though :&lt; i can only dream that one day my wish will be fulfilled.
<comment>
i have it but ive never played it. im willing to try it out tho.
<comment>
im from NA why do you need to know? okay if you buy it too then 3 of us will have it we just need one more person
<comment>
You wanna watch me play Ultima 1? I'll put on some music and we can order a pizza and get some pop. It'll be a blast!
<comment>
im from europe and cant play with people from NA
<comment>
okay then that's 4 of us right???
<comment>
the server is hosted locally so if youre far apart from each other the ping will be bad
<comment>
ive spent the past 3 days hosting skrbbl games on a different imageboard (no vc tho but it's still fun) i'd be down for something like that
<comment>
robot9k.club; not my server but the only one I play on rn, it got posted a few times on here
<comment>
im gonna join u in a few minutes
<comment>
ohh WE NEED 2 MORE PEOPLE FROM NA TO PLAY
DEEP ROCK GALACTIC
<comment>
getting 4 player games arranged is a huge pain, even if they're not anons and are people you actually know. getting cunts to show up at the same time, and want to play for the same length of time without stopping, is a real chore. i was always the one who had to do this for my friend group back in the day
and that's if you even want to play the same game to begin with and don't have to convince them
<comment>
why cant we just play minecraft
<comment>
WE JUST NEED 1 ANON TO PICK SOMETHING THEY WANT TO PLAY AND 3 W/E ANONS THAT DONT CARE WHAT THEY PLAY
<comment>
I wanna play something different
<comment>
i cant play deep rock galactic with u sadly
<comment>
what game can you play then that's not minecraft
<comment>
i dont have a pc sorry bros :(((
which board?? or a diff site entirely?? 
i would still be down but i work a lot and have school but im sure i could fit it into my schedule :>
<comment>
im from EU tho just to let u know
<comment>
WHERE'S ALL THE VIDYA ROBOTS
<comment>

if i had a pc i would play minecraft w you though frfr &lt;3
<comment>

<comment>

I feel so aids. My prom is tomorrow and the only girl I ever thought of taking left me last year or so idek anymore. Life is going very well externally but it doesn't matter how much time passes I never shake this hole in my stomach. I wanted so badly to just move on to someone else but I haven't. The people here are literal shells sometimes. What do u tards think I should do.
its easiest to just move on
honestly dude if you're still tripping over shit that happened like last year, you should find ways to distract yourself especially if life is going fine. obsessing over what could of been and shit doesn't do anything and the more you dwell on it the worse its gonna get, if you're talking about prom im gonna assume you're like a senior in hs or something and in like 6 months you're really not gonna give a shit about HS shit cus you're gonna be removed from it pretty quickly
prom is retarded anyways, go get high with your friends and play smash bros or do some dumb shit before you gotta go to college, you're gonna miss your friendships and the convenience of seeing them so often when yall move away
boohoo I lost muh girlfriend
robots don't go to prom
robots didn't even know what day prom was on

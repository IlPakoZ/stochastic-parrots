What do my fellow robots think about the recent uptick in these "manosphere" ligma male podcasts? They're all over the normie net - tik tak, youtube shorts, twitter, etc. and racking up millions of views. The comments are generally supportive of the male side too. 
My personal thoughts are that while most of them are unbelievably cringey, they are still overall a massive positive for men as a whole. The more NPC men wake up and get with the program, the sooner the terribly inflated women bubble pops. Its basic economics. Nobody buys the stock means it goes down in value. 
This has been LONG overdue, the only question is if the fem stock will actually drop, or if this is just a bull flag.
<comment>
Just like anything else manosphere related it is cope for loser guys. The uptick is because loser guys are on the rise.
<comment>
They're all grifters. The fact anyone donates their money to these retards is an embaressment. Normies will watch the little clips, have a laugh, and then immediately forget about it and continue to simp for some hole.
Stating facts isn't cope. Very few guys are losers, but an unreal amount of women simply have standards that are too high for 90% of guys to hit.
<comment>
The comments are generally supportive of the male side too.
Google any popular men's rights talking point. As a test, "is it OK for a man to hit a woman if she is legitimately threatening his safety?" The vast, VAST majority of people across Quora, Reddit, Youtube and elsewhere support the "men's rights" perspective on this and other issues. Anti-male politics is basically upheld by two TINY minorities: radical feminists and traditionalist police/military guys. Even if you combine these two groups they're like 10% of the population, tops, but the thing is that the police/military guys control all the physical power and the radical feminists feed them talking points that they gleefully use to feed their bloodlust against low-status men.

Why do these things always have 95 foids around a table and then 5 dudes
<comment>
the thing it works both ways
men watch them to be angry
women watch them because they want to mimic these whores lifestyles (wow this girl fucked 5 guys a day, every day for a month, I should do that too)
<comment>
They may be grifting, but they're still doing a great service to exposing the lopsided dating meme for what it is. 
You wouldn't fault a biologist for making a few bucks while researching the cure for cancer.
You forgot the third anti-male party: pathetic simps. They're the ones that actually enable the women in the first place. 
Probably a combination of factors
femoids are desperate to be on there for clout, attention, and new onlyfans subscribers
dudes want it to look more like a harem rather than a sausage fest
dude looks cooler verbally BTFO'ing an entire cadre of women at once, rather than 1v1 solo'ing one
<comment>
And literally just white dudes and an assortment of women.
They know their target audience
Like this guy said 
How does anyone fall for this
<comment>
I find it hilarious how none of these people are ever in relationships let alone healthy happy functional ones. Why would I take advice from people who dont even have their lives together?
<comment>
I don't listen to podcasts. Don't want some dude going uhhhhh hmmmm while involving worthless e-celeb drama and "jokes" into it. If you want to say something then say it clearly and prepare properly in advance. I know you are not and never will be my friend don't expect me to fall for para social relationships.
<comment>
Sounds like you just tried the wrong podcasts. Some of them are purely informational, far from trying to be parasocial.
Breaking Points is good, and JRE can be good depending on the guest (despite it being mainstream)
<comment>
They may be grifting, but they're still doing a great service to exposing the lopsided dating meme for what it is. 
They're saying what everyone already knows that would watch that kind of content. Again, normies will watch that shit, have a laugh at the 10 second they saw, and then proceed to drop tons on a woman and put up with her shit because it gives him a chance at sex with her.
You wouldn't fault a biologist for making a few bucks while researching the cure for cancer
If you're really equating stating basic facts about women's nature to finding the cure the cancer, you need to kill yourself.
How does anyone fall for this
People like to make their opinion known and think it'll actually matter. It never does. None of those woman on those podcasts will change. It doesn't matter how much proof you show them, how much you point out their bullshit, etc.
<comment>
JRE can be good
Joe Rogan is a mid-wit. In 99% of his videos he'll side with whoever the guest is even if it's some retarded bullshit. Not to mention he's just another kike puppet. Look at all the guests he has, the vast majority are kikes or kike puppets. His "dude drugs" shit is annoying as all hell.
<comment>
This is good publicity, if nothing else. Sure, the femoids themselves might not change, but if her simp orbiters change and her numbers start going down, she will be forced to change
bro nobody is gonna change their mind bro
How do you think movements start, genius? By your evaluation, nothing would have ever happened in history because nobody ever changes their minds. You can forget about campaigns and sociopolitical trends, people just keep their same opinions for life. Lmfao
<comment>
You don't listen to JRE for Rogan, you listen to it for his guests. He sides with his guests because thats what a host does, he lets the guest talk and moves along the conversation. Hes not there to fuckin debate them lmao
vast majority are kikes or kike puppets
You could not be more wrong, /pol/tard. Your intense chuddery blinds you. His podcast has been one of the biggest outlets of alternative news and information for years. Who was one of the first big platforms to call out the vaccine bullshit and host guests who are blatantly anti-vax?
<comment>
if her simp orbiters change and her numbers start going down, she will be forced to change
You underestimate the amount of guys willing to pay for their onlyfans, donate to their various sites/apps, etc. Their beta orbiters are already too far gone. She'll just throw him a little bone whenever he starts to get a girl to keep him around. These guys need to be taken out just as much as these whores do.
By your evaluation, nothing would have ever happened in history because nobody ever changes their minds
Things change in history because of force, real actual force. That and most things were planned from the start and they used citizens as fodder. You'd have to ban all social media, onlyfans, porn, etc. Basically take a play out of NK and muslim strongholds. Good luck doing that.
<comment>
If your guest says some blatant bullshit, you call them out on it. Letting them continue to talk just spreads their bullshit as people will assume it must be correct as he approves of it.
You could not be more wrong
Look back at all his guests. The vast majority are literally all jews or kike puppets. This is an undeniable fact. He hangs out with all kikes and is friends with them.
hurr durr the vaccine
He didn't come out immediately and say that it's dangerous to take, just that he chose alternative methods. He didn't come out and say Ye was right about jews. When riots happened for an entire summer, he didn't talk about how blacks always do that shit and get away with it. With Janurary 6th he didn't say it was all undercover FBI agents. He's always months or years late on the truth and even then he only says a fraction of the truth. Lets not even get into Sandy Hook, holocaust, and other clear bullshit.
<comment>
the feminist movement succeeded through force, real actual force
women and girls were marching down the street in squadrons, shooting their oppressive husbands and boyfriends until the 19th amendment was signed
<comment>
if you're not a loudmouthed schizo chud like me, you're a jewish puppet
If he said those things you listed, he would've been booted off every platform within a week. He even hosted Alex Jones, who went through this exact scenario by doing exactly what you said.

You missed the "that and most things were planned from the start and they used citizens as fodder". Try harder next time. The feminist movement was pushed entirely by what group of people? Jews, that's right. Even today all the big pushers of feminism are jews. Most women didn't even want the right the vote because of the responsibility that came with it. They were all fodder by the jews pushing it so they could get more voters and workers they can make money off of.

Strawman. You're really failing now.

Thanks for admiting he's a grifter that cares about money above the truth. You lost.
<comment>
Some of them are purely informational
I don't want to listen to some dude talking his mind or giving "wisdom". I want more efficient flow of information no matter how scripted it becomes Don't pretend that podcasts aren't so popular because people aren't fanboying the hosts and are not making them celebs.
<comment>
think about the recent uptick in these "manosphere" ligma male podcasts
all trash. notice how all these are "red pill" rehashes.
there is a reason that they're becoming popular now.
after recent statistics about most men being single and not looking, opting out of college due to the high cost and limited value, and being underemployed because they are happy not joining the rat race, a lot of politicians are spooked as fuck because directionless men are the single biggest group that can cause unrest and upend society.
so now they're trying to accommodate the red pill shit as some kind of self-improvement thing that they can point men towards. hence why you now see so many normie-tier guys pushing this and women showing up on their platforms and lamenting that they don't have their own redpilled man who has things under control, left-wingers like cuckstiny and that whole edgy-left sphere accommodating it because they know if they don't then all those lonely guys can form an opposition to their project.
also notice how absolutely none of them seriously engage with any blackpill stuff, trying to dismiss it as a joke and loser thing. because black pill scares them to hell. red pill they can manage, just feed the ego of some of these Andrew Tate disciples, give them a chance to buy flash clothes and call them alpha or some shit and they will be back in the rat race, while blackpill will settle for absolutely nothing other than a gf.
<comment>
This kek. Now he will say that he is fighting some soft crusade gaming the system by its own rules but we all knows it's fucking bullshit lol. Like imagine believing that Zion Don didnt do shit because it was le system that stopped him!
<comment>
Trump could have got more done if he spent less time golfing and sucking off kikes and Israel. He's still the best president in at least 30+ years, which is incredibly sad.

How does anyone fall for this
Hopium and copium, reasons why you can have literal geniuses explain their belief in batshit insane religious beliefs only because they want to believe there is something more there then the material world.
<comment>
Telling a partial truth and lying are two very different things. 
Why don't you share some of your news outlets then, o wise chud of the boards? Don't tell me you get everything from /pol/ now. Come on, don't be shy. 
y-y-you lost
y-you're really failing now
Classic retard cope. I don't need to sit here and try to convince myself of such things by constantly repeating "I won!" in my head lmfao
<comment>
they want to believe there is something more
They're just afraid. Religious people are simply afraid that this is it and there is no grand purpose in life. It eventually comes out when you talk religion with them. They don't actually believe 90%+ of their own religion.

You're really bad at this. Strawman and now ad hominem. Yeah, you lost. Thanks for trying though. Keep sucking the dick of your grifters and kike puppets though. I accept your concession. Filtered. Now be a good kike lover and respond to me when I'll never see it.

Maybe you should lurk a bit moar before trying that card, election /pol/tard. Not to mention the fact that you just replied again, LMFAO

poison, but can thankfully act as a gateway to blackpill stuff. every blackpill vs blue/redpill debate is so decisive it's hilarious.

The more NPC men wake up and get with the program, the sooner the terribly inflated women bubble pops
They're not "waking up" they're just following a new shepherd. The kind of person that needs a podcast to tell him how to live is just being manipulated one way or the other.
Nobody buys the stock means it goes down in value
Doesn't apply to human sexuality. One human male can support (buy the stock) multiple females sexually. Keep pushing women away with your hentai-forum misogyny "pills" and harems will be a thing again.
Losers have always been kept out of the gene pool except in present day they can get together and whine about it on a global forum. Now that group is being marketed to because in capitalism that's what you do.

equating
Anon, please learn what an analogy is. You sound like the women in the podcasts kek
<comment>
police/military guys
lmfao wat? The security services are stereotypically the most macho of the macho-men.
<comment>
That doesn't check out in public, especially in a school setting. As soon as a guy fights back, every guy in the area will attack him thinking they'll get pussy from it. There's a fuck ton of videos showcasing this.
<comment>
Police are the ones that automatically arrest the man in all situations involving a woman. If you don't have video evidence, you're fucked. Doesn't matter if you have a battered face and she has nothing, you're still getting handcuffed and assumed guilty.
<comment>
They are only the enforcers. The real ones at fault are the cucked lawmakers who still hold the "women are to be protected" boomer mindset
<comment>
Police don't have to enforce shit and as everyone has seen the past 8 years, they don't under certain conditions. If all police treated the situation right, meaning innocence until prove guilty, they would never arrest the man automatically. They'd simply take statements, take both to the station, and sort it out.
<comment>
The Rational Male has a waayyyyyyyy better and more sensible "podcast." It's just him theorizing on masculinity and reacting to daily male/female dynamics. Way more palatable than these obnoxious panel circle jerks. You can actually steadily consume thoughts piece by piece of his stuff instead of a jumble of nonsense from young women on Fresh and Fir style shows
<comment>
What always gets me is all these PUA and male-female relationship podcast dudes always talk like they know everything about women and how to get them and then you look at their personal lives and their huge losers not dating a high value woman and got lucky making a grift to incels put on a show and production with paid whores. If it was so easy and they had all the answers, then why are they even failing with women? Dont listen to these fags.
<comment>
I swear the people who come onto these manosphere shitcasts are just frozen icecube people kept waiting in ice trays until they're needed and defrosted accordingly. I've had more interesting conversations with my ham sandwich.
<comment>
The more NPC men wake up
I don't know how you guys still have enough hope to fall for this line, normalfags don't "wake up". The government could take to shoving people ass first into a woodchipper while a politician skullfucks you and normalfags would still find a way to rationalize supporting the status quo, they'reno more capable of "waking up" than a cow in a slaughter house.
<comment>
I think you have a false idea of what these podcasts are actually about in the first place. Its not like the PUAs of old who try to teach moids how to "le pick up chicks", these post-Tate grifters simply shit on vapid women.
<comment>
I could do that here, I dont need to hear their 60 IQ, retarded takes coming out of their semen stained mouths. It also gives the false impression that all modern women are like this while they only make up the worst of the whores.
<comment>
They do though say how they've been with a fuckton of women and have a ton of girls they rotate though and all that. They're clearly either lying or all those women are fat as fuck and 3s at best. None of those guys are good looking, tall, and fit enough to pull that many women at once.
<comment>
Sorry I don't listen to chads nothing personal
<comment>
This podcast is shit and the fags who run it are idiots. Intellectually stimulating conversations will surely arise from conversing with onlyfans girls.
<comment>
Midwits arguing with the stupidest hoes they can find. They're usually right but it's still low quality shit, sometimes they have guests who aren't that stupid though
<comment>
So you listen to incels instead? lol
<comment>
Chads have no incentive to change, women have no incentive to change, and the elites have no incentive to change. So unless incels start going ER en masse then literally nothing will change.
<comment>
Amount of incels is rising. If they all just refuse to work, the entire world crumbles. If you believe the 30% or whatever stat about guys not having sex, that's 52 million people refusing to work in the US alone.
<comment>
The spread of NPNW is essential to flipping the script. Maybe one day, bros...
<comment>
Sadly it's also why AI sex bots will never be a thing. They know what will happen. Women have already called for a ban on sex dolls. Now they're calling any guy that's 30+ dating a 20 year-old, a pedophile because they want rich Chads and know they have aged out.
<comment>
Its hard to say. You can say money drives everything, and by that token AI sex bots would be an absolutely HUGE market. 
Make them expensive so that incels will have to work to afford one, and suddenly its very possible.

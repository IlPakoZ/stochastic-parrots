be me
compsci student
living my my parents
they are frequently gone for long stretches of time, leaving me home alone
up late coding for school or foss shit with no one home (as usual)
hear people talking, almost sounds like arguing sometimes
go out into living room
nobody there
walk outside front door, maybe people are arguing outside?
nothing
go back into room, write it off and forget about it
a few minutes late hear voices again
repeat same process, nobody there
This sort of thing has happened many times within the last 6 months. 
I'm pretty sure I'm hallucinating it. No TVs were on in another room. I wasn't under the influence of any substances and wasn't particularly sleep deprived. At this point I pretty much just ignore it and can tell when I'm hallucinating voices or if it's actually real (when someone is home). Am I actually developing schizophrenia or something? Can any schizoanons chime in and tell me what the start of your schizophrenia was like?

I think I get enough sleep and I try to sleep at a regular time, usually 8ish hours a night.

Open windows in your room , it might be carbon monoxide building up in your coom chamber, get better sleep , don't use headphones and play loud music too much and don't have too much nicotine or alcohol or whatever drugs zoomers do nowadays and it should resolve.
If not , get a CO detector for your room and go see a doctor.

i used to think i could hear my parents arguing a lot when they weren't. wasn't coming from next door but turned out to be from upstairs neighbors coming through the pipes or something.

sometimes i think i hear voices in small background noise that i'd otherwise not pay attention to (like the sound of the fan on my computer) but i can tell it's just gibberish my brain is misinterpreting the sound as
also have an issue where i hear voices when i'm trying to sleep if i'm talking with people too much during a day sometimes, like my brain is processing all of that since i don't tend to have long conversations with people
anyways brains are fucking weird

I used to remember hearing sounds like voices when I was younger. I had the odd thought that if I was schizophrenic I would assume they were hallucinations. Now I am actually schizophrenic and I do think that (and I also wonder if they actually were voices back then)

About a month ago, I gave my phone number to a girl and she started texting me the same day. We chatted back and forth for a bit. When I asked her out for coffee, she ghosted me. Women make zero sense sometimes. Why even message me if you have no interest? Why not just throw my number away?

she just gave you her number because she was uncomfortable and wanted you to leave. it probably wasn't even her real number

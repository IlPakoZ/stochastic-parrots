what the fuck is wrong with women?
Anon, you have much to learn
About a month ago, I gave my phone number to a girl and she started texting me the same day. We chatted back and forth for a bit. When I asked her out for coffee, she ghosted me. Women make zero sense sometimes. Why even message me if you have no interest? Why not just throw my number away?
she just gave you her number because she was uncomfortable and wanted you to leave. it probably wasn't even her real number
they need you to become their orbiter to feed their gargantuan egos
it was her number. we where having a seemenly nice conversation but then she ghosted me without warning
looks like she found a chaddier chad 
best you can do is say nothing and hope she'll come back
women have short attention spans she probably forgot u even existed.
You're supposed to initiate dumbass. Feminism has been a disaster for young men

what do you think of them
they carried my 15y.o. personality
Still like them to this day but man the right one has to many tattoos in my opinion
I asked them questions about astral travel at a meet and greet and they were chill as hell
They complimented me on my truckstop motorcycle glow in the dark wolf shirt
You need the Rosetta stone to understand the lyrics sometimes especially Ruby it just sounds like a bunch of gibberish and noise. Scrim used to sound like a retard but since he got sober he sounds a hell of a lot better.
I like their music but they look like fucking idiots

A girl just broke up with me, and yet I feel good about it. All the social and emotion labor involved in a relationship is really stressful. I can finally relax. Not everything is greener on the other side.

Based. In the past i kicked my 9/10 ex out of the house because she was too possessive and made my life a living hell.

Yea I had same thing happened with me. Relationships are so draining. You always have expectations on you etc.
Do what I did. Focus on self improvement and your masculinity. Do things what makes you happy. Be free.

I broke up with all my GFs, and I think I'd rather be the one getting dumped honestly. Dumping people makes me feel really guilty.

Tfw no 9/10 possessive gf
she'd probably get too bored of me cause I don't even have a life she can possess

To be honest It was kinda half-half rather than her breaking up with me. She wanted to take it to the next level, saying things like wanting kids or staying with me for the rest of my life. I said I wasn't really ready for that (precisely because of the aforementioned stress) and wanted to keep it kinda casual. And yes I agree, even saying that make me feel guilty. After some days of thinking she said she didn't want that, and thus she finally broke it up completely.

But that's how you can lose yourself anon, I'm not saying it's bad but i neglected myself because of that psycho bitch and had always my guard up so I wouldn't make her upset. It was so tiring, i ended up playing league 24/7 because it was the only thing I could do on my own. But then again it could just be me cause i need alone time to recharge, maybe that's not the case for you.

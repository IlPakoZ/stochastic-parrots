ITT: Women saving broken men.
Best DDLC girl
Welp, a classic one
Do you have the source?
Stuff like this reminds me of my ex. God I miss her so much.
The numbers are 399618
Not entirely wholesome, so don't whine about it
let her go. a woman's love is conditional. it's not her fault either. nor is it yours that you met her before you were ready. improve yourself.
What a coincidence.
That's what this story is about, in a way.
Thank you.
Hard to say when she was not only my gf but she was also a dear friend. When we broke up I lost someone I could just talk to about anything and truly appreciated me for who I was. Stuff like that isn't easy to let go.
Death or cheating?
Neither, it was mental issues. 
(Originals)
And then you woke up
Her or?..
Her, i had no idea at the time. 
(Originari)
Unrecoverable?
Not necessarily, but it was to the point where it was so bad that she wasn't able to sustain the relationship. It's been about a year now since we broke it off.
You can never fully trust her, right?
I don't see why I wouldn't trust her. She was very honest to me the entire time we were together. I highly doubt she would have broken it off if it weren't the case. She loved me dearly.
She just called him a bitch.
I am soon going to completely die inside. As stupid as it sounds, this was the only thing that could've saved me. Too bad reality isn't about things going well. I am so tired, Anons.
I see, maybe try to make someone else happier, work and responsibility can soothe your mind, if you are sure that she'll understand you and won't feel betrayed.
sauce please for me
Read the thread, lazyass.
can we have one fucking thread you putrid cunt

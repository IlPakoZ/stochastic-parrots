Not entirely wholesome, so don't whine about it

let her go. a woman's love is conditional. it's not her fault either. nor is it yours that you met her before you were ready. improve yourself.
<comment>
What a coincidence.
That's what this story is about, in a way.
<comment>
Thank you.
Hard to say when she was not only my gf but she was also a dear friend. When we broke up I lost someone I could just talk to about anything and truly appreciated me for who I was. Stuff like that isn't easy to let go.

Death or cheating?
<comment>
Neither, it was mental issues.

Unrecoverable?
<comment>
Not necessarily, but it was to the point where it was so bad that she wasn't able to sustain the relationship. It's been about a year now since we broke it off.
<comment>
You can never fully trust her, right?
<comment>
I don't see why I wouldn't trust her. She was very honest to me the entire time we were together. I highly doubt she would have broken it off if it weren't the case. She loved me dearly.
<comment>
but never before has one cried in my arms
She just called him a bitch.

I am soon going to completely die inside. As stupid as it sounds, this was the only thing that could've saved me. Too bad reality isn't about things going well. I am so tired, Anons.

I see, maybe try to make someone else happier, work and responsibility can soothe your mind, if you are sure that she'll understand you and won't feel betrayed.

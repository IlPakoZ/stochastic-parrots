Just sold some of the biggest games in my childhood in bulk for $220 cash to a local store. But I easily could've gotten $600-800 if I sold at used market prices, I'm pretty well off and I don't need the money but maybe I just wanted to get rid of it. Asked my mom if it was a good idea and she said yes but all she ever cares about is money. Idk how to feel about throwing my childhood away desu.
At least you are not a man child anymore and your mom is a kike. Go fishing or kill a nigger or hang yourself like a true white man you are
so you just did it for no reason, you don't even need the money
she really is, which says a lot about her spending and saving habits since she's poor
basically, I wasn't going to ever play them again anyways
Should've sold 'em on eBay like I'm doing. Must be tough being retarded. lmfao
You'll regret it down the line. Maybe not for a number of years, but you will.
could've made a fuck ton more if you sold them yourself online. some megaman battle network GBA cartridges are going for 80-100 dollars. I've got the whole series in my gaming cabinet still, complete with box art. Got a ton of rare games I'm selling individually. takes forever to find a buyer, but they're there. Sold a banjo kazooie N64 cartridge for 150 dollars alone.

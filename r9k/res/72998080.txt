I just want an autistic Mojomatahamoonnna gf then.
Thank you anon, i learned a new word today.
Here's another creepy mojo, Hex Maniac!
Here she is!!
You're creepy autistic pokemon obsessed gf!
Unironically i like the Hex girl because she is despicted having some stalkerish, obssessive and even yandere tendencies in some fan media.
So you bet it! She would be an ideal yandere Mojo gf for me! :D

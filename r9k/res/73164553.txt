I don't have motivation to do anything. All I have been doing in my free time for the past 2 months was laying on my bed and browsing 4chan. I always get late to work and to classes. Even masturbating requires too much energy.

Honestly, that sounds kind of comfy.
How are you feeling, anon? Tell me what you're thinking.

It's not your fault, you are living in a society that has abandoned you and doesn't care about you.
For most people it's just a phase, for me it has become my entire life, I wish I could help you but I can't, I just want to let you know that you're not alone.

I'm wondering if I should kill myself. Unless some money magically drops out of the sky, I will probably end up homeless. It doesn't help that my family (that is, my mother) just thinks I'm lazy and the best advice she can give is to just be happy. I can't.

I'm sorry to hear thar, anon. You must feel really stuck with all of those things going on and with no motivation to change things. I can only wish for your wellbeing.
What used to bring you happiness?

I used to really like Nintendo games, I suppose. I sold my Switch years ago due to financial troubles. It also coincided with this whole spiral of sadness, I guess. I still got my old Nintendo 64 around, but I don't feel like playing it all. I might have to sell that, too.

That's honestly depressing to hear, for you to have to sell your stuff in order to survive financially. I really hope something changes soon for you, anon. 
Do you have anyone you can ask for help?

Yes, the same thing happens to me with the energy, but the great wall that separates us and differentiates us is my compulsive need to be high. I can't stop using drugs painkillers, weed, sleep pills, ketamine, etc , but especially cocaine and alcohol. I've started these last months going to classes high and late as fuck, the other day I was so bad with my hangover in statistics classes that my teacher had to tell me to go to the bathroom to wet my face, because I looked horrible, the truth is that I hate being sober and I don't plan to stop, I can't stand normies and their conversations while sober and i can feel my organs starting to fail, my heart specially.

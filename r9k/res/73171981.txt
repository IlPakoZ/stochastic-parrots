"You're going to live a long and boring life :)"
These words cut so deep. Pure suicidefuel. 
Can I just buy some friends? How much do they cost? There is no clear answer. 
So for reference purposes, can you please name your price ITT. It will help give me an idea of the price of friendship.

little known secret is barely anyone has friends anymore, especially once you get into the work force. At most you might talk to some people online regularly

You can change that every easily, but it is humiliating and fraught with danger and drama.
I have oscillated between introversion and extroversion all my life. Extroversion is painful, but even pain can be good because at least you are having new experiences, more memories, more complexity in your life. Introversion is comforting, I can consume myself in autistic video gaming for weeks and I am happy when I am in the zone, but you only have one life and none of it is real, it is all in your imagination. I try to share what I do in my video games with other nerds, but no one gives a shit, it is so meaningless.
If only I could psychologically combine my obsession with vidya with IRL chicanery, I'd probably be some kind of autistic gigachad by now.

Why are they depressing? Living is enough in itself I'd live a boring life for the rest of time before I faced the uncertainty of death.

nobody cares what you do IRL either, and even then it's only if you made money so that they can copy or leech off of you

I suspected as much. No one I meet IRL seems to do anything but work/school and sleep. I guess that's just what it is now.
Would you be up for negotiation? I'm assuming this is an asking price and not the final deal?
Playing the extrovert is exhausting and adds cringe to the compilation, so it's dangerous. But you're right, and I too fucking wish mindfucking yourself enough to make being outgoing as comfy as not. qq
Being immortal would solve any problem, but we aren't immortal, so having a boring life is the same as wasting it. And being told you're going to waste your life isn't it.

So true, it's mostly just groups of people addicted to the same drugs (alcohol or weed).

The cost of my friendship is the truth.

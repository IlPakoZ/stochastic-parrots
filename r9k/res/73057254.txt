Do u want 100 years more of this anons ?
No, not especially
I can't wait until the retirement age is 120 and wageslaving 100 years becomes the norm.
Damn, guess I'll have to NEET an additional decade kek.

also it'll only for for the super rich, poor joe wagie is still gonna die in his 70s.
Just in time for the new retirement ages, who would have guessed. 
Ideal, shovel your grave (for minimum-wage) right before you croak goy.
Productivity is life!
its just bullshit they repeat so they can increase retirement age. modern politics is defined by the retirement question.
Since we totally didn't sleep on the population development question, nosir! 
Besides citizen, that was clearly the fault of the guy in office before me! Pure accident that my party nodded their laws through too

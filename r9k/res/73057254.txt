Wouldn't sweat it. Its about those born now, and and even for them it is probably one of of those purely theoretical calc examples that would require a monk-tier safebubble lifestyle that nobody wants to have because it can hardly be called living.
Also having a pulse and being able to sell your insurance more meds does not necessary mean you are not having your brain and body eaten by degenerative shit until there isn't much 'you' to speak of left. 
Even if the medical people at large do have officially hopes to get some shit like alzheimer and some cancer types avoided or better treated.

I take the transhumanist approach. Even if things aren't working out now, they're bound to change in a few decades, so it's always worth sticking around to see if you get lucky.

Just in time for the new retirement ages, who would have guessed. 
Ideal, shovel your grave (for minimum-wage) right before you croak goy.
Productivity is life!

its just bullshit they repeat so they can increase retirement age. modern politics is defined by the retirement question.

Besides citizen, that was clearly the fault of the guy in office before me! Pure accident that my party nodded their laws through too

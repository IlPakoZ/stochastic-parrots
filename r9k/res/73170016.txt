i just cant enjoy video games no matter what i do. it just feels like loading screens, boredom, and stress.
I'm struggling with gaming as well. Just feels so hard to seriously invest time in a game. Used to be so easy.
At least on an annual basis, I will get the urge to devote weeks of my life to building a massive structure in minecraft. After 6-8 weeks, that autistic obsession of playing for 10+ hours every day will suddenly dissipate. Within a year, the cycle will repeat again.
But for the most part, I barely enjoy video games anymore. I find myself either browsing 4chan or bouncing around random slop on youtube, forgetting what I watched just five minutes prior. My attention span is fucked.
I want to like vidya, but every time I start playing, I suck at them and then I get sad
Find hobbies or activities besides media consumption, and then mix up the media you consume, instead of just playing video games, consume anime or movies or books or something, then gaming will be enjoyable again.
Games are not the same as the ones that I grew up with and I am 35
Welcome to depression
That's a blessing not a curse. Gaming is pathetic and bad for your brain and body.

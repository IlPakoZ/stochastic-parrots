overwhelming desire to have intimacy with an actual human female
the few women around have next to nothing in common with me
they are either taken or single moms already (I don't like kids)
my anxieties and awful personality would scare them off anyway
Living in a rural shithole town fucking sucks.
i dont like kids
why? thats like your one job as a human. youre supposed to be wired to like and want kids. now i understand if its just because theyre not your kids. i live in a rural town too and can share these sentiments.
Just drink alcohol and watch television alone in your basement bro.

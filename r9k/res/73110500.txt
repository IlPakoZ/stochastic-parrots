I'm running from the military and I jump off a mountain into a portal, I'm then stuck in a dungeon where I need to find giant weapons to open doors, to then go through a portal that takes me into space where I need to for some reason pick up a tombstone, to then be relocated in a supermarket on the moon just so I can help this guy wipe his ass.

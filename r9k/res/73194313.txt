I have been thinking about getting this surgery. I make 6 figures, workout regularly, and all that. But im also 5-9 barely. Might as well be 5-8. My faggot parents were manlets. If I could be 5-11 to 6-0 then at least one of my problems would go away
Snap out of it, don't be a retard.
I hate waking up everyday and being reminded that I am genetic trash and jokes being made at my expense about something I cant control. I dont want to be a fucking manlet seething incel anymore.
You're not a manlet, but you're a brainlet, and soon to be a cripple.
If it matters that much to you and you go with a reputable surgeon, I don't see the problem. How would you explain this to your boss? I know recovery from this sort of thing takes a super long time so you'd obviously have to tell him/her, but telling him would meaning saying "hey I'm super insecure"
brainlet
Am I for being obviously aware of the worship for taller men? That men my size are posted in fucking chastity cages and the poster boy for cucks? 
a cripple
I already have an exit mask made just in case shit goes south. Since I have the money i dont have to go shitholeland (india) to get this done and go to Vegas or Cali instead. 
Either way, I turn into someone worthy of being seen as a man or I kill myself. I win one way or another
My job is basically work from home so I would just say bring my laptop with me
Dude, not worth it.
No seriously. They're litterally gonna be breaking your bones and you'll have to endure rehab most likely, not to mention your proportions getting screwed up, muscles being forced to stretch, etc
Why do I have to be the one to post it
face over height
Yes I understand the constant debate about this. My chin is not recessed and my jaw is fine. I obviously dont look like a model but im not deformed either.

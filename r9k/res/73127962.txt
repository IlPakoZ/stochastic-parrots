Its actually creepy how mainstream the redpill grift is becoming. Even YouTube has been recommending it on the front page, along with Tate videos and such, and it all feels like a very artificially constructed and forced meme. Even normies are trying to cash in on it now. And its always some rapey looking mulatto dude with chapped lips sitting in his bedroom with a mic giving out the advice.

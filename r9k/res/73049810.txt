Idk if it's my autism or if I genuinely just fucked up my sexuality but I literally cannot understand having sex for love or fun. I have only ever had sex with a guy when I want something from him. I don't think I can handle a relationship because I would probably just use my body to manipulate my partner rather than enjoying it for what it is.

I don't think that's a very good thing to do. You'll probably suffer for it in the future if you don't stop.
it's okay to not desire sex though. Always remember that you are in control of your own mind. good luck.

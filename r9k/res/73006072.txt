its totally possible looksmaxxing does nothing. god is omnipotent lol. i've just given up i guess. hes shown me hes omnipotent but i'm still made to think that things can be "earned", despite the fact that we've apparently all been set up to fail from the start.

I am 5'6'' and have been with 10 girls. I could be with more but I've spent 4 years in a relationship at this point.

i am not sure where does this clouded sense of thinking there's a mystical mommy gf out there to basically spoil you a little. I mean, we already see how normies just magnify the smallest gesture from a woman to be like saint's day so idk, your expectations are too high
maybe go to the church of richard ramirez and he'll bless you soon

Take up martial arts, at your height you'll be paired up with girls anyway to spar/roll/etc. Then you'll get "hugs
from girls every class. Sure it wont be tender hugs but she'll be hugging you because she wants to and you wouldn't have to take up any bluepilled nonsense.

hey man, with your stature they probably wouldn't even notice if you hugged them. it'd be like a little speck of dust landing on their shirt or something. i say just go for it bud

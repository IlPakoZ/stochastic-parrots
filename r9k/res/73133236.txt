bro I fucking hate that little shit Kirby
Kill kirby, behead kirby, roundhouse kick kirby into the concrete, slam dunk kirby into the trash can, crucify filthy kirby, defecate into kirbys mouth, hang kirby like windchimes, launch kirby in a rocket in the sun, catapult kirby into an active volcano. Total kirby death.

I know asking help from you guys isn't the best idea but I don't have people irl to ask for help.
Be me
Notice my little sister is pissed for several days
Get worried for her
Ask her what's wrong
She breaks down and says she took mom's phone to play but saw a chat, mom is cheating on dad.
Ask her about the chat but she doesn't say nothing too definitive.
Calm her down with the best possible scenario, "Maybe is a spicy talk between girlfriends, that can happen between older women".
Get hold of mom's phone.
Find the chat.
It's definitely another man
The guy is definitely trying to dick mom down and even refers to our grandparents as his fathers in law.
Mocks dad
Feel my heart sink
Notice mom's side of the conversation.
Nothing.
She never agrees with him
He has to pester for several days to get a "Hi" or "Good morning" but it feels like an obligation.
The man even complains about her ignoring him.
Think it's maybe some insane stalker that believes mom likes him
But that's the thing, she never blocks him,
He's muted but never blocked
Maybe she feels intimidated? Nah, as a kid I saw her kick a guy trying to rob her trough a window in the bank.

See other chats
Spicy talk with her girlfriends
it's just fantasies with famous actors so I don't give a fuck.
Mom has no problem talking about sexual stuff with them
See more of the chat with the man
Again, she never answers
But she does give him information he doesn't need to know.
He would say: "How was your day, thicc girl" and get ignored for several attempts
At the point she's getting annoyed she would answer what she's doing
reading a book, at the cinema with our dad, etc.
Realize that the times she said she was going out with her friends all night... she wasn't lying, there's photos of them going out all night just themselves in their chats
Feel somewhat relieved
But she never blocks him, even as he mocks our dad, which makes me feel awful.
What the fuck it's happening? Does she just wants the attention?
<comment>
Women like attention even if its from men they dont like.
Some women in relationships like to download tinder and swipe yes on everyone just to see how many guys will beg for her attention.
Shes keeping him there for a ego boost.
<comment>
Women love attention and it sound like nothing, just don't get involved with it as you would make things worse, sounds like a sex pest or someone she knows
Maybe one of her GF fellas
<comment>
i know this might sound scary, but maybe you can ask your mom for a private chat between you two.
tell her what you told us?
tell her lil sis was snooping in her phone and saw stuff, admit you were nervous and curious so you looked too.
it might be annoying to say, but tell her you aren't judging her, that you're just worried about the family and how she treats dad.
<comment>
this hits close home man, something similar happened to me as a kid except it was worse. Are you going to confront her?
<comment>
Maybe you should talk to your mom about it. Don't bring it up in a busy setting. Just text her: mom, can we talk about "Marc" (insert name here).
Who knows what's going on, abusive ex? Someone with some sort of leverage?
<comment>
i know this might sound scary, but maybe you can ask your mom for a private chat between you two.
The scary thing for me is my little sister, and dad.
He's 63 and close to retiring, and between the two, mom's definitely the breadwinner.
He's a man stuck to his routine and such.
I'm scared of shaking his world that much at that age.
But I really just want to be comfortable around mom again.
This is surprisingly sane and tolerant for what I was expecting from /r9k/.
That made me feel so much better guys.
<comment>
Tell the guy to fuck off Whirlpool pretending to ne your mom. Simple as.
<comment>
That's a tough situation anon, I wouldn't really know what to do desu. I do agree with the other anons though in that she's probably doing this to make up for all that lost non stop attention from men when she was younger. My Mom's the same, she used to get tons of male attention then one day nothing at all, not even from my Dad. 
This is surprisingly sane and tolerant for what I was expecting from /r9k/.
Come on man you know you can count on us, r9k isn't the boogeyman you've been warned about.
<comment>
Like many anons said. Women LOVE attention. I know women in relationships that download tinder only for the validation. They love knowing that they are wanted. Your mother is a woman too. She probably loves your dad and has no intentions of leaving, but the female brain is a funny thing. She's probably just feeling a bit bad about herself, and that's when women in relationships download tinder. They get endless matches and constant positive feedback. I've heard a woman say that she feels really good from getting a single like/heart on social media... It's like a drug for them. Easy dopamine hits.
<comment>
Another odd thing, I reread her messages (Desktop whatsapp), the guy writes like ass.
Not like drunk bad, or trying to be informal bad, it seems like legitimate mental retardation or just plain illiteracy.
Which is odd considering mom's known disdain for ignorant people, since I was a kid.
I know I'm probably grasping at straws, but it occurred to me that she answers because of pity? Like, if some literal retard tries to be lewd at you.
But the whole situation is odd.
Tell the guy to fuck off Whirlpool pretending to ne your mom. Simple as.
Don't wanna do something drastic with my father and little sister involved, I want as much info as possible.
She has a second phone, a work exclusive one required at her job.
He's also in that phone which otherwise is nothing but work contacts, she's given me that phone hundreds of times before to help her use google maps because it has unlimited data it just never occurred to me to check her chats, but for what I could read, (she was in the room, didn't have time), it's more of the same pestering and basic salutations and unnecessary info.
I wanna read that other phone first. If I don't find nothing more damming from her I'll choose between >>73004757 or >>73004777 depending on what seems best for dad and sis.
I hope I don't.
<comment>
You don't have to decide today. If you want to think it all over it ok to take your time. How old is your sister? Old enough to include in your thought process? Are you going to decide on a potential confrontation togheter? Would she say or do anything rash?
<comment>
How old is your sister?
13, but again I can confront her myself alone, but I'm more afraid of dad.
He might just fucking croak in worst case scenario, I just can't bear the image of a man that devoted his life to his family, salt of the earth, near retirement, and not the breadwinner unlike her, having the idea of his family shaken from under his feet at that age.
I feel very relieved and thankful with all the anons telling me is just for attention that she hasn't blocked him and otherwise is a nothingburger and feel very tempted by
just don't get involved with it as you would make things worse
But it occurred to me that if something did happened this might be just to keep the man from spilling the beans.
<comment>
Notice my little sister is pissed for several days
Sounds like she needs a dicking.
<comment>
thx for ruining the moment.
<comment>
I think mine might be cheating on my dad too, but I hope I'm wrong.
<comment>
I just checked the other phone, it seemed the same bs at first.
Not only do they see each other, I think my sister is his daughter.
<comment>
please bump, I don't know what to do.
I'm in shock right now so I don't feel anything, but I'm afraid for tonight.
<comment>
You should deep dick your sister. And if you're right, it's only your half-sister which makes it socially ok.
Think about it. She's emotional and could agree to a lot of things. Tell her that you'll still always have each other and it would help keep the family together.
<comment>
Porn really does make you fucking psychotic.
<comment>
Probably the back up man
<comment>
Oh god I'm so sorry. Now you really need to talk to her. That's horrible anon but it's important for you to know or else it will be on your mind constantly tormenting you
<comment>
you need to tell your dad.
<comment>
find him and beat him, hard, there are no cheap shots
this makes me angry to read even if it's a fabrication
to fool around with someone's family without a care of being a homewrecker, potentially ruining many lives because you think with your dick, man or woman, deserve what's coming to them
<comment>
Why the fuck does he says she's his daughter?
My dad is who spend 13 years of his life working for her, caring for her, almost being too lenient.
I was the one who learned to change diapers at 14, who helped her with her school homework, woke her up every day, made her breakfast, changed her until she could do it herself because mom and dad worked before school opened and arrived until after it.
I was the one who was with her 2 years uninterrupted during the pandemic.
She's 13 now, a teenager already in many ways, but we still have this little game were we play pretend with her stuffed animals, each one has a personality, and I just stepped out of my room knowing she was possibly the daughter of another man and she called me to play just for a few minutes before continuing watching TikTok teen stuff.
The fuck is that man saying.
And the only reason I never doubted mom is because she was always a hard ass, strict but until today the most trustworthy person I knew.
Why?
<comment>
So, I've decided, confront her privately.
I still don't know if to tell on her.
I know it's kinda ass but I just need to confront her to sleep well at night again, but I genuinely don't know if my sister and my dad benefit at all from the truth at their ages.
Frankly I just want that fucker to disappear, I'm very torn because they both deserve the truth but no one deserves the pain of it, especially when its more likely that they will loose the stability they need.
I really don't wanna hurt my dad and sister brothers, imagine learning not only that your wife is a cheating whore, but that one of the kids you love potentially isn't yours, at the age of 63 where the opportunity of rebound is close to none.
Not do I want my sister to start doubting her family at such a young age, I still enjoy the games we play.
If mom was going to be with another man couldn't have she at least divorced 13 years ago?
She was the breadwinner, and it's a woman, she stand to loose nothing and the pain would be so much less.
<comment>
Can't let this thread die out, I truly hope the best for you anon. I've had similar problems but nothing comapres to this fuckery. good luck in confronting your mom.
<comment>
A glimmer of hope.
I want it to be, just a small one.
I did use his proclamation that my sister HIS daughter as the confirmation of her cheating, but I forgot what he said before >>73004701 (OP)
He referred to my grandparents as his parents in law.
So maybe he was just applying the same insane logic.
I still got to confront her, but that means that at least that's not true.
Right?
<comment>
He only refers to her as such once and it's very passing.
<comment>
Huh, upon realizing about this, I noticed how little do I care about my parents relationship, the moment he referred to my little sister as his daughter, that's when my heart sank.
Considering mom in the chat mentioned she was busy picking up HER daughter to his pestering, as usual, to which he responds is also his, but she just ignores him, as usual.
I think this is more in line with his insane logic in which he called my grandparents his parents in law, despite that clearly not being true.
So after that weight bench lifted from my shoulders, I realize how little do I care about my mom having an affair or lying to my dad, it's their fucking problem. IDGAF, as long as my sister is out of that mess, I have not the slightest inch of fear about confronting her in comparison, I can almost sleep like a baby, lmao, thanks guys, this was a very trippy afternoon.

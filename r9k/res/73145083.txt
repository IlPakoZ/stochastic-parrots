How the fuck did she not get groped and raped by pajeets there lmao. Can you imagine some shitskinned manlet seeing this tall white goddess in his homeland? He'd probably spurt a flood of curry in his smelly undies right there and then.

because, suprise suprise, India's rate of rape isn't actually as high as it's made out to be, it's just that when India has a slightly higher rate of rape and China, the only country with a comparable population (Third place US actually has a higher rate of rape than India but India still has more than 4 times the population) has a very low rate of rape, it means India is naturally the highest by raw number count which makes it seem pretty bad but it's really not that bad relativly speaking, obviously rape is a bad thing but it's nowhere near as bad
It's also worth that the BBC (one of the biggest new sources if not the biggest) which at this point has been established to have an anti-India bias basically publishes any rape that occurs in India and well, you get my point
Also you will be suprised to hear this but a random video of a foreigner getting harassed, while bad, does not actually tell us anything about a country of 1.4 billion quite surprising right

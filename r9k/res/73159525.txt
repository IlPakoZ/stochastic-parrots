I am a straight cis man that hates men. I have never meant a man I was comfortable around. Every single one has some racist, sexist, or extreme self centered ideals. I don't just mean dirty jokes, there's a difference between jokes and personal values/world view. At a previous job there was a kind coworker that I thought may be a potential friend, but after spending more time around it turns out that he makes rude comments about fat women. Maybe I should have said something but is it my place to tell grown men to be decent people. Something I've noticed is the more popular a man is (across all genders) the more disgusting he is in private. I was in a bird watching group for a while to try and make friends, but one day when none of the women could make it the men used their binoculars to watch women jogging around the lake and point out hot ones. Inb4 "you must be an effeminate male", nope I am very much a stereotypical blue collar dude sans the idiocy and lack of awareness. I feel sorry for women that through no fault of their own are attracted to males, and I don't even have to worry about violence as much. Picrel, normies will say "what a great guy", but he probably unironically rates women on a 10 scale even though he's married, gets enraged at someone using his drive way to turn around, or makes jokes about black peoples hair.
Men are the ringleaders in this anti-morality movement that has infected the world. All of this stuff about how you need to be a whore who curses and swears and does drugs all the time to be cool--it ultimately comes from men. Yes, a lot of women have been infected by it, but it's ultimately rooted in male behavior patterns.
You are spot on with that. We need another temperance-esque movement, it is the 20's after all. I think it is happening with women refusing all right wing men, but there's just as many disgusting men on the left, they're just better at hiding it.

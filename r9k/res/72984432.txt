does sissy hypno actually work? i got curious and tried it, seems kinda cringe desu. do people actually become femboys from watching this shit?
<comment>
No, it's just fetish material.

Hypnosis only works if you want it to
<comment>
Yes it works, but not because of hypnosis.
It works by desensitizing you to the acts it portrays and convincing you that you'll enjoy it
<comment>
It's just a kink, people watch it because the idea turns them on
It doesn't turn people into sissies. The only thing that sissy hypno can do is make you more comfortable with the idea of jerking off to it

This chad former schoolmate of mine once met a dominatrix who said she could easily dominate any man, and turn him submissive. My friend was a former Quarterback with a competitive spirit so he said "lol bullshit, try your best." She said "sure, but you have to agree to a session of sissy hypno first." He agreed, and she performed the hypnosis on him right there in the club we were all chilling at. With in 10 minutes she had him walking around all fours, kissing her feet and calling her goddess. He spent the whole night grovelling in front of her. We later heard that she moved in with her to serve as her full time pussy licker. I checked his Instagram recently, he's wearing lingerie seemingly 24/7 and posting all these extremist feminist memes about how women are superior to men.

Pretty much this. Proper hypnosis actually studied by psychologists is still up for debate on if it's real. The sissy hypno is just desire which leads to belief/effect. 
Hypnosis for the seriously curios by Kenneth Bowers is a book which might as well be half citations and talks pretty in depth about what real hypnosis is like. Even statistically about what drugs are more likely to increase susceptibility to hypnotic induction. Mescaline.

 lol bullshit, try your best
All the sub erotica is like this, part of the kink (defiance, involuntary, nc etc). Your boy craved all of the humiliation and corruption

hypnosis is a submission thing
its not magic mind control voodoo bullshit, its a person submitting their will to whoever gives them instruction
in this case because it makes them cum the big cums
that said, because of how autistic and retarded most of the people who are into this shit are, like 99.99...% of the hypnosis "content" is completely fucking garbage, because its not about giving gentle instruction and breaking down mental barriers and etc, its just emulating this subliminal ludovico technique style bile that they all do because they idealize that is how it SHOULD work, and god knows the foundation of all fetish garbage is delusion
in short, no its not gonna do shit to you
youre just watching (probably gay) porn with a pink tint over the video and a bunch of nonsensical captions
and given that youre making an active decision to do so in the first place, you were probably already interested in that before it even started, dont lie to yourself
<comment>
Yes becareful, hypnosis could make you do the most disgusting things.
<comment>
That's not how hypnosis works.

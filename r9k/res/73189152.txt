at community College
swipe credit card at a vending machine
buy $1.75 snack
walk away to class
see some black guy walk to the vending machine
class ends 2 hours later
check credit card statement on my phone
see multiple charges worth $21.50 for the vending machine
remember credit card info is stored in vending machine for 15 seconds before inactivity
tfw some nigger used my card to get free snacks

the vending machines have no security cameras
the college has no security staff
they have no way of identifying students
Well, he's a stupid criminal, but it's up to you if you choose to be a stupid target.

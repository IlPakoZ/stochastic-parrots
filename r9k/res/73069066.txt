maybe you shouldn't have degraded yourself so much by asking in the first place if being rejected by such a lowly person makes you want to kill yourself.

Vaginas are disgusting, wrinkly chemical toilets meant to devour sperm and farm yeast for the filthy vagina ecosystem.
I hate women more every single day. you're all such disgusting windbags. Even if this is a larp, I have hope for the tranny race to btfo women in sports and all sorts of other things. I would support making lesbian terfs go to jail if they don't fuck someone on the basis of birth genitalia.

Assert dominance. Grab their head and make them go down. The tran will submit quickly.

Why would you want to be a billionaire if you hate them?

woman
assert dominance
I like the idea mommy dommes too, but they're not real, and most males could quickly just force a woman to submit for real. Unfortunately, dominant females are just performing as such for whatever reason. It is absolutely not their real nature and never can be.

In our 20s, my mom asked me to put in a good word for him when he applied to the company where I work. He quickly got promoted over me and now - in our 30s - he's co-manager.
I have to take his shit because he can literally fire me now. And there's a lot of shit he's making me eat, believe me.
Obviously I regret bullying him because we're adults now and with age comes perspective but I guess it's too little too late.
Why don't you just change jobs?
What if you just bully him a little? Or talk to him "bro what's the deal? Why are you being a prick?"

I closed it 10 years ago

i have it and 2 people that i did group projects with as friends. sometimes i look up the normalfags i knew ~10 years ago. seems a lot of them moved to instagram or something as their profiles stopped changing.

I have one from my high school days but I lost the email on it. So its just sitting there with pretty embarrassing high school stuff publicly available for anyone who searches my name and it pisses me off that I can't do anything about it

I don't have anything on mine but they want me to verify my id to log back in. Fuck that.

I have one, but it's been dormant for the last 10 years. Don't only old people use fb nowadays anyway? Most normalfags are on instagram to my knowledge.

I stopped posting there in the mid-2010s and I officially requested it be deleted on (of all dates), 9/11, 2021

How has this impacted getting jobs?

And relationships?

are you asking because of that facebook settlement shit?
<comment>
Deleted my account last year

Even if you don't have one Facebook has created a ghost profile for you

This has never effected me. Also it's 2023 who the actual fuck still uses Facebook? Shit fell out of style like 6+ years ago only literal boomers in their small shop garages use Facebook anymore and it's for the market to do tool trades and deals. Like the only people in my family that talk of Facebook anymore are my mid 50s early 60s uncles

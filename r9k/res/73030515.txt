I think weight builds slowly for the past 4 years I haven't really been exercising and eating too much and I have gained 15lbs but at that rate in 10 years I will probably be chubby.

Alcohol and HFCS. Far, far too many people take in far, far too many calories in liquid form.

500 surplus calories is a pound per week, or 52 in a year. 250 gets you 26. Just 100 surplus calories gains you more than 10 pounds in a year, or 40 pounds over the course of college.
It doesn't take much and builds up over time. Even a slight imbalance between your needs and what your body signals for hunger/desire can fuck you over the long term.

You're completely right. It's a shock to me as an American to go outside and see everyone so fucking fat. But after watching for a while I realized they are always eating something.
meal
snack
meal
snack
on top of only drinking dessert coffee or sugar packed energy drinks. I'd die if I lived like that.

When you're depressed you don't eat much. Fat people eat huge meals, have more than one meal a, day, and have huge snacks basically every hour. It's impossible to get fat if a person only eats until they are full but these freaks ignore the fullness and keep eating beyond that point. I hate fat people so much. Not just stupid and immoral but they're all extremely ugly too.

I have to go through physical pain to be a "normal" weight. 
I used to be skelly tier and honestly miss it.

If anything I have a cup of coffee for breakfast, but I don't buy it for my home. Just if I visit family over Christmas or something. The body doesn't need food for a while after waking up. Fat people only do breakfast for entertainment and a display of wealth. Why else do they eat when not hungry? Lunch is only necessary if doing a lot of physical labor. For most people it's also entertainment. I have a very lage meal in the afternoon and eat until completely stuffed along with alcohol to stimulate the appetite.

I am hungry way more than you are
I bet our definitions of a "large meal" are also different

Do you smoke cigs?

I'm almost obese (5'7", 185lbs), and I don't even care. I have no friends, and no girls are interested in me (yes I've tried talking to them). I work a shit job that takes up most of my day, still have to do chores for the family in my free time, and even when I don't I have nothing interesting to do. No hobbies. I can kinda sorta program but have never made a comple program (even though I have several ideas on what to make). At this point food is the only thing that makes me happy. I skip breakfast but I still eat too much.

Why so upset? You could transfer that anger to operating SAM emplacements and denying the enemy air superiority.

I listen to a lot of random music, currently I've been into early 2000's grime, but literally anything goes. This is a chart from the last month(?), but generally I feel these don't represent my music taste very well
<comment>
You guys have to stop listening to meme music.
<comment>
it's just music bro, where's your chart?
<comment>
Very little music since forever. Even less in the left five years. I dug Pang and Vespertine. I listen to Spotify's weekly discovery nowadays. Have been listening to twice lately.

Kind of impossible to do in a chart, but this is a mix of my favourite albums by my favourite artists (cringe)

This is my past month. Haven't made one of these in forever and it doesn't look any different. I always try listening to new music, but I keep coming back to the same stuff. Especially when I drink. I think the only reason Manfred Mann is on there is because of this song. I listen to it multiple times everyday. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TsCCgwvT3bs&amp;pp=ygUaTWFuZmVkIG1hbm4gYWludCB0aGF0IGxvdmU%3D [Embed]

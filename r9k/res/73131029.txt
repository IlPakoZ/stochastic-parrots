Asked this in the cosplay board already but only got angry rants as responses.
I'm gonna cosplay for an anime convention in a few months but I haven't decided on a character yet. Came here to ask for some ideas and suggestions of preferably well known characters that fit these criteria 
male 
preferably tall 
preferably on the more muscular side 
long/medium (preferably black/brown) hair 
(preferably short) beard or stubble 
moustache
Keep in mind that preferably means that other options are possible but that'd be my starting point in selecting a character.

Not bait but yay, frog time :D
Thanks for the compliment
I'll look into him, he looks cool. I wanted to watch/read Kengan anyway, I heard it shares a few similarities to Baki.
<comment>
a much more kino baki.
it's not as far-fetched as baki, everything has decent sense.
you'll also either have a little couple shipp or not like the best girl in it. no spoilers, tee hee.
kengan omega i've heard is also decent. anyhow, read asura first.

also also, i'd read first, then watch if you want to.
the animation style is nice, but they're glossing over a lot of stuff for the sake of time.
the manga is much more kino, and the illustrators are really good.

didn't look into /cos/
I don't know what that is, I just went into /cgl/. My thread should still be active.

Appreciate the compliment broski. I don't mind dropping my Discord or IG for proof. I'm not an incel but I understand a lot of people here as I grew up on the internet as well.
Will do, thenku thenku

I'm so envipus of woman for being able to cosplay whoever whenever and everyone thinking it's hecking wholesome 100
<comment>
Damn.
I actively read the Baki manga so reading Kengan would've been my first choice already :D
<comment>
I mean, you can still crossdress or whatever else it is you want to do. Nobody complains if you pull it off well enough :0
<comment>
based.
you'll enjoy it, it's great.
i'll also rec abyss rage. pretty nice manga too. and quite short.
<comment>
Thanks! Any other recommendations? I've been running dry on shows and manga lately, I feel like I've watched and read every big thing of the recent years already.
Oh, and as a somewhat thanks, look into Hajime no Ippo and Blue Lock (I'd recommend the anime, but the manga for both is phenomenal as well). The latter was quite surprising for me because I usually dislike team sport anime due to their huge focus on teamwork and the power of friendship and what not but I doubt I've ever seen something as competitive as Blue Lock.
<comment>
jokes on you i already know both.
go read one piece too.
don't really have any more recs desu.
<comment>
Watching the anime currently, avoiding the manga for spoiler reasons but thenku

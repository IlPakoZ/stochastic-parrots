Anon, do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others? Can you recall a memory in which something provoked lust in your heart? Please tell me your story, in as much detail as you're willing to offer.
(As a secondary query, purely to add flavor, what is a behavior you believe very few other people exhibit? Consider this the thread-question equivalent of being offered a mint after you dine at a restaurant.)

Well, I only interact with people online because I'm a hikkineet, but I have so many thoughts that race through my mind about hypothetical women I "meet". Like licking and touching all over her body to study her responses, maybe even recording it so I can learn further. Maybe watching with her and seeing her be embarrassed at every little moan and squeak would excite me further, as would having her describe each act in as much detail as I desire, even though she's shy.

For as long as I can remember I always segregate real people and sex. Probably contributed to my wizardry since I approached women as the typical nice guy and instead of wanting them for sex I wanted them for love and affection. Honestly it is weird how I had sad friendzone love periods and I didn't even think about sex with the girl I was depressed over.

I worked with an absolute turbo giga stacy bimbomaxxed thot once whose lips were so nice looking I couldnt help but think of her suggin with them

Oh hey you're back. Welcome, maybe this thread will also hit another 400 posts.
Anon, do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others?
Usually I try to repress my sexuality in life, as if I'm ashamed that I feel sexual desires for women I encounter, though recently one of my office coworkers comes into work wearing skintight sweatpants. I'm not specifically attracted to her (because she's a married mother who barely interacts with me), but I very rarely interact with women in public settings since I graduated college. Seeing a woman actually present herself in a sexual manner makes me feel somewhat complicated, especially since it is hard to hide arousal in my dress clothes, though it's a feeling I'm trying to explore more. 
Can you recall a memory in which something provoked lust in your heart?
I lead a fairly boring life, so I don't actually meet any woman who invoke lust in me. A few years ago, my one friend (who is actually social) convinced a girl I didn't know to send me nudes after we had one conversation together over text on some social media platform. I've never actually dated a woman before, so the idea of something like this, a woman being so loose that she'd give me something like that without even knowing me, did wonders for my masturbation sessions when I got them, even if one night stands aren't actually something I want. I still have the images she sent me somewhere, despite never talking to her past our initial conversation.
I'm still trying to overcome the barriers in my mind that prohibit me from being an emotional/sexual creature, so these threads actually somewhat help me. It normalizes the idea of my lust. So, thanks, in a way.

clicked on the thread basically by instinct

hello alcoholic glowie mothgirl coomer anonette
i only really have lewd thoughts when i'm around my crush. sometimes when we're alone i think about just holding her hand or kissing her by surprise. of course at night i'll dream about having all sorts of naive virginal sex with her. maybe the most lust provoking memory was when we went to the beach and she was wearing a swimsuit. she's pretty androgynous so she wore a bikini top with some swim trunks which i thought was really hot and adorable since i like the male_swimsuit_challenge tag on the boorus lol
<comment>
no. i have to force myself to have any kind of those.
i believe very few people exhibit this same aversion. with how the world's going, everyone thinks about getting their bits wet.
i've turned down women nearly jumping on me, and i simply lose interest if i get any back.
the "love" feeling i get vanishes when i get to know them and they aren't interesting in the slightest.
i also quite enjoy solitude, and would prefer to be by myself with a good book, or in a nice place, than to be with a group of people.
it's nice.
<comment>
Ahh, well, I'm very nearly hikki myself, so I can relate that far, in the least. It sounds like you have quite the healthy imagination, to my ears! Quite a lot of vigor put into that daydream...
I can understand the desire to do so; reality is so grimy, abrasive, and unforgiving. Fantasizing about the fictional offers a much more comfortable cushion between my psyche and the unrelenting grubbiness of the primeval urges I posses.
Bzzzzzz! (That's the ambient sound emitting from all of those buzz-words you just dropped upon me!)
This time, I have decided that once I clock out of thread organization and have my rest, I shall not revisit the thread until the following evening, when I may wish to post anyway. This way it would have nearly the full day to expire!
I am happy to assist in normalizing your lust, Anon, but please don't view me as some sort of role model in that regard; you should endeavor to be my opposite. Explore lust in healthy moderation, and without shame.
I must say, the casuality with which she was willing to expose herself is rather electrifying. Strangely enough, the moment I read your account, an immense ringing took over my eardrums for a pause. Peculiar! 
If you must post, you must play by the rules. Talk about your lustful desires or merely observe. Witness me! I am being firm! 
That's rather sweet, Anon; I'd hate to be a negative influence upon your psyche... are you certain this thread is a healthy place to spend your time?
I tip my digital cap to you, my sober monk-ish friend, and I wish you the greatest of satisfaction along your life of noble quietude.
<comment>
If it's real life, I do my best to hold back lewd thoughts for obvious reasons and it usually works, even if I'm alone with a woman, but it's immediately a problem the moment I'm not interacting with them. One time an older and married woman offered to give me a haircut and my idiot self accepted thinking maybe she's really into me and she isn't fat so why not, only for it not to happen at all.
Also, if I'm interacting with a girl I'll only ever know online, I just let my feelings be known, so to speak... better to take my chances than to not.
<comment>
why be so strict with me, mon beau?
i have posted. i think i'll really end up a monk at some point.
i wonder if i'll ever find an interesting woman i can connect with and all.

i fucking hate you u ruined me

how did she ruin you anoni
<comment>
what do you mean? are you trying to imply i'm a normalfag? i've posted plenty of more degenerate shit in your threads in the past. anyway i'm smoking and drinking and gonna jerk off to said niche tag in a little bit. unless you have a better idea?
<comment>
I save all of my lust-filled, lewd thoughts for you, and I'm keeping them to myself.
<comment>
If I don't fap I have indecent thoughts about all sorts of women I see in everyday life, but that's not strictly what you asked since I'm not interacting with them. (Target has a lot more attractive women than any other store near me and I'm not sure why this is.) And just to be obnoxious I'll answer your question with a question, define "lust"? Like, its one thing to want the body of a porn star or camgirl, but I don't much think of her after I've fapped. As compared to girls I actually knew (past tense) and still think about; in one sense that's lust because I want (or rather, wish I could have had) them sexually, but it's different, more like a longing than lust. It's either partially or entirely about *her* instead of just her body. I guess I'm quibbling over terminology. Doesn't "lust" imply some kind of obsession beyond "unga bunga this is what I'm gonna coom to tonight"? 
(I'm that douchenozzle from your thread last week who was obsessed with the Asian lesbian, so you may want to take anything I say with a grain of salt.) 
purely to add flavor, what is a behavior you believe very few other people exhibit?
Well that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it? Any kind of behavior I do that most people don't? There's a lot of those but few if any are interesting.
<comment>
also to add onto my post, everything feels superficial.
i think i'm kind of forcing myself to feel the love and etc.
sometimes i just snap out of it and want to leave from a group, or just lose all interest in a woman i had flirted with.
<comment>
I am happy to assist in normalizing your lust, Anon, but please don't view me as some sort of role model in that regard; you should endeavor to be my opposite.
Well it's moreso, "hey there's a chick also struggling with her lust, so I'm not completely alone in this regard." Plus, the other responses too, it fosters this sense of community. Makes me feel less weird for being me. I'd love to moderate my lust, but it comes in waves. Sometimes I feel nothing at all. Sometimes I become the tension of the accident that makes the beast the human endeavour and I become insatiable. I feel "normal" for now but lately I've felt that insatiable sensation oncoming.
I must say, the casuality with which she was willing to expose herself is rather electrifying.
Yeah, I've had some people try to convince me that I could've had sex with her if I tried a little harder, but I think it was more of a voyeur thing, like she was getting off to the idea of me getting off to her, without any intentions of us meeting up. If anything, maybe that'd be her answer if she was in this thread.
Strangely enough, the moment I read your account, an immense ringing took over my eardrums for a pause. Peculiar! 
Uh oh, don't explode! Or maybe the ringing is a sign that you need something to electrify you in the same way.
<comment>
do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others?
I get hard when people call me "small", "shorty" or things like that. basically when they mention how short I am(162cm)
Until now no one noticed, I think.
<comment>
I see... well, I commend your self restraint, at the very least. I apologize; I have little to offer in terms of conversation when the subject is decent, regular patterns of living.
To protect the interests of the good and decent Anonymous posters that come here to discuss matters of lust and fantasy in pleasant company, free of judgement.
Oh dear! I can't imagine what I've done to evoke your wrath, Anon, but I do apologize, I'm certain.
If this is a response to the buzz word reply, I was merely trying to make a joke! I apologize if it was offensive, my sense of humor is horribly underdeveloped! 
You thief!
I imagine Target likely has attractive women due to it being a fairly affordable place to purchase makeup and recent fashion, leading to women who care about their appearance flocking their for the deals!
My personal understanding of the concept of lust is rather warped by religion. In my mind, it's any sexual desire borne out of wedlock. In common nomenclature, you are likely correct about the implications of lust as a word, but all such details are foreign to me!
Thank you for acknowledging the secondary question, you are the first!
Ah, I see. Far be it from me to dictate the means by which you enjoy these threads; so long as you feel you are somehow better off than prior to expressing your thoughts and desires, I'm pleased to have you!
I do believe you are correct; I'd imagine a woman who thrive in the spotlight might feel electrified knowing that a strange man has seen her most private areas. Perhaps she chose you knowing that it wouldn't lead any further? There's no honest way to tell.
Perhaps the ringing is a sign from above that I need to indulge in some horribly humiliating public exposure... or, more likely, I may have tinnitus. Blehhh.
Pardon my brevity, but, why?
<comment>
You thief!
If you ask me very, very nicely, I might acquiesce and let you in on a few of my thoughts.

That's what happens when you're talking to a KV about interacting with people in real life ;_;
<comment>
i always find your pics so pretty.
how can i converse if the thread topic does not lend itself to me posting?
ill have to wait for a decent moment to write you a poem, at best.
<comment>
No way, Jose! 
Rats, the expression falls quite flat without the little ` riding atop the e...
I'm no beggar! We'll have to work out some sort of amicable exchange of written text, or no deal!
I did apologize in my original filename for the inconvenience to fellow hikkikomori!
Thank you, I appreciate the compliment of my artistic taste!
As for your query, well, the thread has a subject and a direction; if it's not a subject or direction that can offer pleasantry to you, I'm afraid I have nothing to offer as consolation. I have no desire to exclude you or any Anon, but I won't warp the thread to accommodate interests antithetical to the initial premise, I'm afraid.
<comment>
nope nuh uh, never
all the people I talk to in real life are during work time and it's hard to get aroused during work
the second one is easy because the answer is hugging me
born to hug
forced to cum
<comment>
atleast make it a tangent or corollary; i've already posted all i could of the present challenge.
i'm feeling your writing to me as quite stern and dry. are you upset with me anonette?
be not angry, i'm just a friend
i'd rather this was not the end
these words so serious and stern
when can i your love again earn?
<comment>

maybe, I guess? then again the competition is walmart and some grocery chains, so maybe it stands to reason. 
My personal understanding of the concept of lust is rather warped by religion. In my mind, it's any sexual desire borne out of wedlock.
I was raised Catholic and the experience made me an atheist. (m'lady) So I guess that's all of it then? I'm not married and never will be. idk, I guess I'm not explaining things clearly. There's cooming, and then there's lust, the former can be done with anything sexual, it's just satisfying a bodily function, the latter has a target, someone you lust after. 
Thank you for acknowledging the secondary question, you are the first!
well, you're welcome, but it's not like I actually answered it. do you want something related to the above? Or just whatever?

When I interact with my gf sometimes I wonder what she looks like with someone else on top of her. She teases and flirts about it sometimes, but she's never been with anyone else.

No non-ASCII text is a blessing and a curse.
Well, let's get this exchange going. Give me a starting offer, and we'll haggle?
I'm no beggar!
We'll see about that.

so long as you feel you are somehow better off than prior to expressing your thoughts and desires, I'm pleased to have you!
Pleased to be here, if anything.
I'd imagine a woman who thrive in the spotlight might feel electrified knowing that a strange man has seen her most private areas. Perhaps she chose you knowing that it wouldn't lead any further?
Perchance. She only sent me her breasts. From my experience, and what I've heard of others, women seem a lot more forward sending their breasts, while hiding their ass or privates. Though if the goal was to get off, it seems like the easiest way to do it without the other party getting "attached" to something they can't have. Or, you know, maybe I just suck at manifesting reality and seducing women.
Perhaps the ringing is a sign from above that I need to indulge in some horribly humiliating public exposure... or, more likely, I may have tinnitus. Blehhh.
Well the only way to find out is by contacting a friend of a friend of a friend and exposing yourself to them, seeing how it makes you feel. That's easier than fixing your ears, right?
I believe I have another lust story somewhere in the back of my head, I'll respond if I end up remembering it.
By the way, this is somewhat unrelated (or related?) to the thread topic, but you should check out the webnovel "Cockatiel x Chameleon," you seem pretty literary/verbose from this thread/another thread I was in with you. It's about a silver haired office worker discovering her repressed lust after meeting a porn artist, you might get a kick out of it. These threads have reminded it of me lately.
<comment>
Me and My Mom regularly walk the dog every day after work. There's this gardener that occasionally works near our apartment building, he's working all day. We had some old Fresca sitting in the fridge for a while, so one day when out she took a couple of them to give to him out of kindness. She complimented his work and energy to stay out in the sun for ours, and it got my heart racing for a moment.
I've stopped consuming NTR, when fetishes impact your real life they can be very dangerous.
<comment>
I hope somebody hugs you, Anon :(
Make what a tangent, or a corollary; the thread? My responses? I'm rather lost in what you are attempting to request.
I am being firm, because I promised myself that I would be firm. I want Anons to enjoy my thread. I am attempting to make it my priority.
I was raised Catholic as well! I would likely convert into atheism myself were I able, yet I find myself unable to alter my mindset from that I was raised to exhibit. I will forever imagine spiritual beings observing and judging each of my actions and thoughts, and my conscience is an entirely separate and independent entity from the remainder of my mind. I am assuredly too indoctrinated to rescind my membership.
I can understand your defining of the term; lusting being somewhat intentional, and meditative. I find all of my sexual desire to be prolonged and meditative, as a quick session to relieve tension isn't exactly within my itinerary, so I failed to consider the difference.
As for the secondary question, I meant nothing in-depth by it, I only thought it might add some enjoyable variation to the posts. As an example; when I do not know the lyrics to a song, I involuntarily fill in the blank spaces with lyrics about how I'm very stupid; a gift from my little sister, I'm afraid. She used to warp lyrics to Christian music as a means of berating me, and it stuck right in my noggin!
Why, Anon? Are you saddled for travel? What is our destination?
Ah, the curse of NTR...
I shall make my opening offer; you shall exchange to me three confessions of your secreted thoughts, and in return you may ask me three questions, all of which I must answer in complete honesty. Of course, barring questions such as 'what is your home address'.
Do we have an accord?
<comment>
it's any sexual desire borne out of wedlock
do you find that to be a sin in itself?
from what i know the problem is acting on it. everyone will be tempted.
even Christ was. glory be to Him that was able to resist it and loved so much he took the punishment for our failings in our place.
<comment>
What is our destination?
a little place called "two orgasms"
<comment>
It's not really a curse. It makes me feel competitive.
<comment>

the light shines. you've learn to put it where it can light the entire house.
i'd say that's a quite pleasant thing, if you've got the correct view and perspective of it.
you didn't really finish explaining your idea of being judged last thread, if i may ask for a final time of evangelizing.
<comment>
Yes whenever I interact with a cute girl I always get lewd and romantic thoughts about her
<comment>
I may have my understanding of my sex misconstrued, but I believe it is because breasts are much easier to accept as aesthetically pleasing, even in the mind of someone very insecure; men's strict preferences in the appearance of genitalia is infamous, even to those like me, with no sexual experience and little exposure to sexual subcultures. It would make exposing genitalia a constant risk of beratement, which I can imagine even loose women would prefer to avoid.
Ah, dear Anon, you forget the third, and easiest option; do absolutely nothing at all, and let sleeping dogs lie. My ability to ignore pressing medical concerns is legendary! My talent for avoiding all living beings, even moreso!
I'll look into the novel, thank you for the suggestion, Anon.
NTR is a pox upon our community, I wish you the utmost fortune in never touching the material again.
Anon, any time I was discovered to have spent any one-on-one time with a boy in my life, I was grounded for a full week. What is or isn't a sin, truly, in the eyes of God, matters little; nearly anything causes me guilt, and in the scriptures, it's said that if a man commits an act he feels guilt over, even if it is not a sin in the eyes of God, it becomes a sin to disregard what you believe to be right. This means I am a sinner, through and through.
It sounds quite exotic! Is it in France? They make up silly words like orgasm, don't they?
Ah, well, as long as you're content...
Could you perhaps link back to the initial post? I never recall earlier threads very clearly, aside from broad emotional impressions. I would like to keep the evangelizing brief, if possible; this thread is for lewdity.
Truly? Can you recall a specific instance?
<comment>
NTR is a pox upon our community, I wish you the utmost fortune in never touching the material again.
Yes! NTA, but recently I had an experience that made me never want to read an NTR hentai ever again. May all anons read only the most innocuous, innocent vanilla hentai.
<comment>
Hello, writeranon! How was your day?
Anon, do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others?
Usually not, even when talking with cute or pretty girls. In most cases I am merely consumed by emotions, trying to control myaelf from acting too awkwardly due to my attraction to her, but usually I do not have indecent thoughts during such interactions.
what is a behavior you believe very few other people exhibit?
I usually try and "beatbox" by knocking my teeth together. It's a truly strange behavior.
<comment>
well, does it?
would a man, not in perfect reason, who finds communion or even the act of passing a church wrong, be sinning by going to one and receiving it?
that quote is referring more to "grey area" things, like the food dedicated to idols.
same as you shouldn't eat it if you felt it was wrong, and should avoid eating it if it may scandalize someone.
do you think God is some sort of bureaucrat with a checklist, eager to deny you entry to heaven?
quite the opposite; a loving Father who wants nothing but for you to be in the correct path and get ever closer to Him.
quite a shame that you've been brought up in such a situation. that's a senseless excess of anything.
were you ever told why you were grounded for spending time with them?
or simply told "it was wrong" out of some sort of misunderstanding or lack of knowledge on their part?
i'm afraid i cannot find the original either. it was something about your view of God and of being judged. quite like the post you've said it here aswell.
why not a bit of this talk? i reckon anons don't mind much, and i find it quite interesting. doesn't spend too much space beside a single reply.
what do you others think? i'd like to get an opinion. preferably where you aren't rude, also.

A fine opening offer, no haggling required. You are fair, indeed. The first of 3, for now.
At University, I was walking home and there was this knee high wall, with a small gap that only one person could fit through. I was walking perpendicular to the wall, while a woman was walking along it on the other side, both of us (presumably) headed towards the gap. I slowed my movement because we were going to hit it at the same time, and she followed suit. I sped up, and she did as well. It was like the whole "you go left, I'll go right" thing in corridors, but completely unspoken, while we were both staring at our feet. When we got there I stood at the gap and thought about picking her up and moving her aside. Just the act of potentially picking her up, and also this autistic connection we seemed to have, lit this fire in me. I thought about picking her up and bending her over right there, ripping at her clothes and almost entering her, before leaning atop her and telling her to beg me for it, which of course in this fantasy she did. In reality, we must've only stood there for seconds, but it felt like a lifetime. We moved aside and went on our way, me with far and away the largest boner I've ever had in public.
Tell me what, if any, sex toys do you own?
<comment>
Ah, dear Anon, you forget the third, and easiest option; do absolutely nothing at all, and let sleeping dogs lie.
Wow, you're just like me, frfr
Though this does actually remind me of more lust stories, since the goal is to course correct.
The first was a chick in high school. She seemed pretty into me, and I wanted to date her at one point, though she was mostly leading me on for nefarious purposes. However, at one point, she slides her phone over to me in the middle of class and says she wanted to show me a video. On the phone screen is footage of her somewhere in the school, a realistic dildo in her hands, and in the video, she quickly shoved the entire length of it in her mouth and held it for a few seconds, before letting it slide out and laughing at the "absurdity" of the situation. She said she wanted to show it to me because it was funny, and she seemed entirely sincere in believing it was more comical than sexual, though from my point of view, I just saw footage of my crush, who I believed also liked me, sucking on a sex toy, so I awkwardly laughed with her then went home and got off several times trying to remember what she showed me, trying to imagine it was me.
The second was a random woman I met online, who used me as a sort of "nude" tester. She wanted to date a different guy (who she is now married to), and thought I was funny, so she sent me several erotic images of her body, to see if they were good enough to send to someone else. Images of her bare chest, images of herself in the shower, images that teased her playing with herself without actually letting me see. Never any of her genitals. And she never wanted images of myself. She just wanted to know that I enjoyed them. This lasted a few months before we drifted apart.
Thinking now, perhaps always being second fiddle in these sexual situations is why I feel so conflicted about my lust, as it's always been something to view from a distance, never to attain myself.
<comment>
I find myself unable to alter my mindset from that I was raised to exhibit.
I have some family members like that. My branch (my dad and I) are kind of the black sheep since we're the irreligious ones. 
I find all of my sexual desire to be prolonged and meditative, as a quick session to relieve tension isn't exactly within my itinerary, so I failed to consider the difference.
allegedly it's a male-female difference? I've heard people say things like that before, that girls can't feel physical desire without emotional desire, whereas guys can feel it in an emotional sense, but in the absence of that it's just like getting hungry, it's an urge you have to take care of now and then. and sure you'd prefer to have a nice steak (that is, the girl you really want) but if that isn't on offer, you have some instant noodles or a sandwich or something (whatever fantasy is *cough* to hand) 
As for the secondary question, I meant nothing in-depth by it
here's something vaguely related that probably only I would have done. I had Jehovahs' Witnesses come to my door once (well, once while I've been living here) and I did my best to get them to come back, after which point I read more about the Bible than I had in two decades just because I wanted to see if I could make one of them squirm by asking them difficult questions. The bit I (vaguely) remember was that they had their own Bible after having switched away from the King James version, and I made a list of things that were in the KJV but not their version, so I could ask them whether such-and-such a parable was really scripture, and if not, why not. The one I recall was, appropriately enough I guess, Jesus and the Adulteress. But they were too smart for me, they never came back. Bah.
Anyway, I already have all my chips on the table betting that Pascal was wrong with his wager, and I'm already contributing to your delinquency (What's the religious term for that? I forget) so here, have this AI pic.

sexualizing nuns is a very despicable thing, in any case.
i've seen even quite irreligious folk avoid such degeneracy.

my brother, have you ever dirty talked with someone in the act?
the most fucked up shit is incredibly hot when you're horny, the same is true for dumb shit
<comment>
i have, the most eye-opening moments are snapping out of it for a bit and realizing the stuff you're doing
i've been able to stop myself at that moment some times
<comment>
well, I'm a pretty despicable and degenerate person, in quite a few ways that, in my opinion, are worse than vanilla blasphemy.
<comment>
why?
just pettiness, or rather some maladpted cruel sort of way of getting back at people, or wanting to just poke or hurt them?
<comment>
lewd or indecent thoughts
I am terribly ashamed to admit it but I have what seem to be known as "emotional boners". These are hard boners that pop up whenever I think of showing serious vulnerability or non-sexual affection to others, even imaginary people (2d girls). Can be simple acquaintances, relatives, male or female. Doesn't matter. What matters is me perceiving them as safe and nurturing people who'd not dismiss and let me hanging. I do not consider this as lust provocation, but it's always baffled me. I do have indecent thoughts when interacting with scantily dressed women, but I think that's normal.
what is a behavior you believe very few other people exhibit?
I wouldn't say few exactly, but definitely fewer than before: being affectionate in public, cuddling.
<comment>
It's best described as "fuck this, I don't care any more". which isn't exactly pettiness, but I guess that comes closest.
<comment>
words that i wanted to use finally came to mind.
as for your upbringing, i get the feeling you were on the pointy end of a Scripture-ignorant facade of what belief should be.
all that oppression at any sign of not being "perfect" (in a sense of perfection that's already not correct).
must've been bad.
<comment>
if you didn't care you wouldn't prepare a dossier to torture jehovah witnesses.
edgy shock value "cheap thrills" would be more precise, i reckon.

2/3
I was 17, at school, hanging out with friends sitting about on the school field. I was a very skinny boy. Not especially tall, but some would say lanky. I went to playfully grab a sweet from a friend who was nearby, and she pushed me. I fell over, and she was on top of me, and she gave me this look as if to say "Ha, I beat you!" Well, I very easily turned her on her back and pinned her arms at her side. She couldn't do anything, and the look of surprise roused something in me. I think the public nature of it, and that other girls in particular were watching, just filled me up. I wanted to take her there, but of course I managed to contain myself. I still think back to the look she gave me. Was it one of lust? Of disgust? Simply of surprise? I'm not sure.
Besides the obvious, where on your body is the most sensitive?
This one open at your own peril. Really.
I read a thread on /r9k/ in which a woman asked for fetishes, and my thoughts about her ran amuck. I believed us to be of a similar age, and in similar situations, and while my initial thoughts were of rough poundings followed by loving cuddles, my first, fully-formed thought was this: we nervously kissed, awkward, my hands gently, shyly brushing her cheek with my fingers. When we pulled apart, I felt myself unable to explain my thoughts, and instead took her hand and placed it on my chest, so she might feel my racing heart. She returned the favour.
For my last question, I want you to share something with me. Something about you, decided by you. Something you think I'd like.

maybe even some sort of power trip at thinking yourself better in a prideful little way. comes out that way with the questions and actions
<comment>
Hear hear!
My day was satisfyingly routine, thank you! How was your day, Anon?
It's quite cute that you are too flustered to be lecherous, Anon...
Chomp-boxing is quite a funny thing to imagine, but I gave it a try and I can see why you indulge! I clench my teeth to relieve tension frequently, so the impact is somewhat gratifying.
There is difficulty in these conversations as early as the premise of the intention, so I'll try my best to explain the roadblock.
I have no love for the Church and no enthusiasm for it's teachings. I am held hostage by fear and guilt; that cannot be assuaged. Any volume of educated theology is simply wasted on me.
As for my view of God and his judgement, it's likely the voice of my mother, flanked by the voices of all the authority figures in my adolescence. I have no doubt this is theologically disastrous, but as I've said, it's incurable; she and they have been my only connection to Him, and as such, they have spoken for Him.
That calls to mind the musical number from Aladdin!
That's quite the electric tale! A millisecond meet-cute sparking a roaring inferno of desire in your mind... this is exactly what I was fishing for with my initial query; you boys have such active imaginations, it's marvelous! Thank you for sharing!
I only own one; a blue.... dildo... it's such a terrible word, both for how absurdly silly it sounds and for how deeply unclean it seems. I have long been tempted to purchase additional materials, but have at least pretended to resist such degeneracy thus far. My decision to be alone for all of time has only settled in my heart as of earlier this year, so I now lack much of the reasoning to resist; that being, that purchasing the more advanced toys would 'ruin' me, paired with the shame of having a sex toy collection being difficult to accept. I expect I will cave to my desires before Christmas, though that's pure conjecture.
<comment>
seems to fit my >>73181940 idea then.
you should be able to break free from that false sense of it.
what keeps you? proper indifference or some sort of fear, like avoiding the risk of pain?
<comment>
or, to be poetic, you have not the light, but a warped reflection of it from a jagged and warped mirror.
why not stop looking at the mirror, and find the proper source?
i reckon that is a very big question and absolutely not a thing to expect of someone, if this may be understood in any way as a threat or somesuch.
<comment>
Ah, I'm sorry to hear you were led on by a peer for nefarious purposes; I can commiserate the experience. However, that particular tale is incredibly erotic! I can't FATHOM the brazen confidence one would have to possess to show another person such a thing. I do believe I would truly die if the thought ever crossed my mind in a context which allowed it. Are women so commonly teasing, to such an extreme degree, in the 'real world'? 
The second tale is very strange indeed... the concept of loosely sexual relations, while still being at arms length... it seems so filthy to me. I feel it's because the nature of it borders between fetish and social dynamics, the former of which I am free to explore in solitude, the latter of which strikes terror in my heart. The middle ground being... a queasy, uneasy feeling, in which I am warmed, and unsettled. Still, an excellent contribution to the thread!
Ah, well... is arousal not an emotion? I was rather under the impression that sadness opposed happiness, hate opposed love, and feeling ill opposed feeling aroused. Am I mistaken? Moreover, can men feel an emotion and arousal simultaneously? My gracious, this makes quite a few things make sense...
The tale of preparing to duel the Jehovah's Witnesses is quite amusing to imagine, especially the picture of you reading scripture out of spite!
The religious term, I believe, would be lasciviousness! 
Anon, do not ridicule other posters for being lewd and lascivious! That is the proper behavior for these threads, and if you dislike it, you are welcome to avoid these threads in the future. I will hear no more complaints out of you, am I understood?
Anon, I think you've managed to acquire an honest-to-goodness kindness kink... it's quite cute, I think, but I do hope it doesn't cause you any inconvenience.
<comment>
Anon, do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others?
I become flustered whenever I have positive social interactions. I only interact with people on the internet, and only through text. Whether it's someone agreeing with what I say, expressing genuine interest in what I have to say, calling me "based", or just using pleasantries like "good night", it can make me feel flustered and very warm. It isn't sexual but it feels very intimate. Intimacy and positivity even on this tiny scale is a foreign and exciting experience to me as a 27 year old khhv neet who always avoided everyone
<comment>
i cannot keep myself from denouncing something like that.
i was really expecting you had not indulged in something similar.
i suppose you've atleast not done it again.
have you truly repented?
do you wish to keep that shame and guilt upon yourself? you seem to wear it with pride and dress up its chains as to say you're trapped. you know there's a someone who'll forgive and clean all of that, if only you turn to Him. who suffered all of that, for you specifically.
what a terrible world we live in.
<comment>
Such is the nature of things.
Oh my! You've quite the arsenal of tales to tell! The schoolyard roughhousing conjures a very sweet, adolescent bliss atmosphere to mind. The type of whimsy-filled risks and experiences every youth should be free to find themselves in. I'm not certain even she would know what she was feeling in the moment, Anon, but I suspect she thinks of that moment rather often herself.
Hmm... my neck, I'd have to say; I jump or gasp from time to time, when my hair brushes against it. My little sister gave me a 'choker' as a gag gift one year, and wearing the thing to humor her left me lightheaded for the full evening, sending chills along my spine frequently. I once touched an ice cube to it, after reading it was arousing to some women in an article, but it made me yelp and fall from my seat instead. The cold was far too intense.
I can very much understand your perspective, Anon. I'm a 26 year old hikki, and though I work, it's only responding to emails. These threads are somewhat of a mental overdose for me, the pleasure from which truly exhausts me for days.
At my own peril, truly?
Oh dear... oh grace... that is... you...
I have spent some quantities of time cowering beneath my covers. You musn't imagine... gentle little touches and, and hitched breaths... oh you devil...
You've put me in quite the pickle, Anon... what sort of things do you 'like'? I'm quite terrible at making decisions of this nature, and I find myself terribly dull...
<comment>
good artist
ofelia is my wife.
<comment>
If you must ask, you have never experienced a true fear of God.
There is no mirror; my eyes have been altered, and there is no reparative surgery available.
Well Anon, as I must make myself take breaks when I become overwhelmed, you must make yourself take breaks when you feel driven to scold. I will not have it.
You really must be thinking highly of me, when I've given you no reason to do so; I am a sinner and each day I sin further, with my only intent being to intensify said sin until I am satisfied or I have passed on. As He said, I will reach St. Peters gate and he will turn me away, for he never knew me. 
Now please, control yourself and be polite if you wish to post in the thread further; I will not discuss religion like this any longer. It is souring the mood.
<comment>
my neck, I'd have to say;
Similarly here! My neck is so ticklish, that wearing an outfit with something brushing on my neck is enough to irritate me! Even seatbelts bother me sometimes. I struggle to imagine what it would be like for someone to run their fingers across my neck, or what it would be like for someone to put their nose close to my neck and gently breathe on it...
<comment>
My dear, if you could read your responses from my view, you'd realise just how far from dull you truly are. I deeply enjoy your responses, but I will give you no further instruction on what to give me. Just as my thoughts were from my heart, I desire something from yours.
<comment>
How was your day, Anon?
Today was beautiful. I traveled to somewhere with some beautiful scenery, and was left alone with my thoughts amongst a grand landscape of mountain-ranges, a smattering of cherry-blossoms and roses, and a river of fresh air. It was the opposite of routine for me, seeing as how most of my hours are spent not admiring Mother Nature's beauty but rather staring into the soulless light of my computer screen.
Chomp-boxing is quite a funny thing to imagine, but I gave it a try and I can see why you indulge!
But it is quite embarrassing to imagine a scenario where someone points at my jaw and asks, "Why are you knocking your teeth together and making weird noises?" Fortunately, I think most would just stare disapprovingly at a distance lest they get into a confrontation with my shy self. 
It seems I am making the most of this mint that you've offered me. I feel ashamed for not having much to offer in the way of your main question. Perhaps if, after getting over my embarrassment and reluctance, I will share a story that pertains to your question that I can hopefully find within the mess of my memories.
<comment>
Seat belts have always felt like saws slicing into my neck... I despise them.
I couldn't begin to comprehend what feeling a warm hand resting upon it would stir in me.
I like to think I am quite good at responding, Anon, but I really have no talents beyond that single act. By asking me to share something from my heart, you've asked me to unearth you a gemstone from a pile of dry sand. I am an eloquent writer, but I have nothing to say until I am given a starting point. I have no hobbies, friends, or interests. That which I feel may be enjoyable to read about for others are unpleasant recollections for me, and nothing relevant to my current state.
I very much wish to answer your question, but I have little of interest to say until Anons give me a ball to roll. I am also fading, so please allow me to fulfill my debt before succumbing to the night!
What a lovely sounding outing! I'm glad to hear you enjoyed yourself!
Feel no pressure to share stories you don't wish to, or to conjure them under threat of stress; the thread will fare in either circumstance. As it happens, I'm running out of gas, so I expect to be winding down here momentarily. Just a few more loose threads...
<comment>
I didn't comment on your responses, but I assure you I'll be thinking of your neck, the differing sensations of hot and cold upon it, and your short, sharp inbreaths in reply, all throughout my dreams. And when I wake up I'll read your response, where you'll tell me - from your heart - your deepest sexual fantasy.
You strike at something in me, anon. Even if I have to invent a Philosopher's Stone-esque substance myself to do it, I'll see that sand sparkle like a jewel.
<comment>
I orbited a petite yet shapely girl once who always wore tight jeans so I always imagined her sitting on my lap and wiggling her butt.
<comment>
Whenever I see cute girls in public I immediately think about fucking them.
<comment>
but I do hope it doesn't cause you any inconvenience.
Unfortunately, it probably will. I don't know how I'll react when the opportunity presents itself in real life, because it's hard to hide if you're not wearing thick clothing. I'll likely make excuses to walk away which is incredibly sad because I swear it's not sexual, not consciously at least but it's happened so many times I can't deny there are some crossed wires in my brain. Instead of flushed cheeks I get erections, oh well.
<comment>
Can I remember when lust was last provoked in me IRL??
Litterally last week, with a busty new coworker who seems interested in me (Boobs like picrel) until I learned how easy she is to agitate.
She grabbed some stuff off the floor, went to touch open food and I had to remind her to sanitize her gloves. She tarted repeating the instruction in an unhinged manner and got super irritated then begrugingly complied. 
Anyway my lust for her is gone, after she raised that red flag for me.
<comment>
Hey anons, what's the sexiest sex you have ever sexed?
<comment>
I think you may remember me surveychan girl whatever, and the girl I've been mentioning before, I'm not going to describe her because I think she may be browsing this board. Especially because I know she most likely doesn't feel for me the same I do for her!
Almost all of our conversations have sexual undertones. We've talked about masturbation together, what kind of things were into, and even exchanged pictures but in a more than friends but less than lovers kind of way, she has massive fucking titties too. Our friendship is super odd, but there's a part of me that wants our relationship to stay like this forever, and a part that'd want it to be more than what is is currently. I'm conflicted about these feelings honestly...
Especially because most of the time our conversations were super detailed and engaging, but recently they've been dry from her, maybe I'm slowly fumbling the bag, but I have a hunch that I may have hurt her feelings in some way, and I may or may not know what it is.
If that's the case and she doesn't like talking to me anymore, I'll be the first one to leave, It's less painful than just moping around and longing for her just for her to leave. It's pathetic I have to rely on an online girl to comfort me, and lessen my loneliness, but, most women in my area are just plain out not my type.
sorry for the long ass gut spill, also yes i've masturbated to pictures of her. thx for the thread surveychan girl
<comment>
Also prior to this interaction I had regular fantasies about dating and kinky hucow-themed sex.
If it were me a few years ago I'd probably not know better than to just drop the idea, or maybe not even be able to. 
I fingerbanged a chick infront of her friend under a bridge once. Mind you this is when I was around 15 and was too pea-brained to think much of the crazy-chick tendencies and teenage-angst fueled baby fever she had. Thankfully nothing came of that relationship.
<comment>
I don't particularly have any lustful thoughts when interacting with others, most was feeling some butterflies, but my mind did not jump to lust during the encounter.
I think people generally don't exhibit kindness that much more often, especially on the internet; I am not too kind myself, but I am actively trying to be the change I want to see.
<comment>
I'm the type of person who can't have lewd thoughts about real people whose faces I know but I did romantically admire my crushes. However, I have had sexual fantasies of people on the internet whose face I have never seen. I always felt ashamed afterwards but I think the reason why I am able to fantasize about those people is because they are much far removed from me and I don't know their face or them as a person. I have masturbated to probably 3 people in total now, it's pretty embarrassing I didn't even know them really beyond a few words.
<comment>
Oh damn, look at the good part anon; You can be sure that you were attracted to their character, and not neccesarily their physique, I'd personally say that that's not too bad of a trait, even more-so considering you used your imagination and not internet's-heroin
<comment>
That's true, but I didn't even know them as people. I only did it because they were nice to me, the most recent only talked to me only once even. Only said two sentences and I masturbated to it so I do feel embarrassed about it. Other than those three rare instances I only fantasize about fictional scenarios and characters from imagination.
<comment>
Ugh my brain is pulp today, gonna answer the secondary query now:
I think one of the few behaviors I see peole exhibit is actually just reaching out to people. It feels like everyone is kind of in their own little world unless it pertains to gossip or work stuff. 
I do see a lot of the older folks exhibit it, but in anyone millenial-age or younger it's... Almost non-existant. Hell, I don't even exhibit it, too anxious about asking something too personal even though consciously I know most people would love to just go on talking about themselves.
<comment>
Oh... bunk. I can't exactly rush through that request, can I.... and right before bedtime too... sigh. It can't be helped I suppose. My hands are already shaking at the thought of confessing my filthy thought crimes.
My deepest held fantasy is very particular... the details are all very specific. The premise would be that, after working up the boldness to indulge in my sexual weaknesses more and more, I begin taking self bondage seriously. Right now, all I have had the bluster to commit to doing has been lying myself up and just sitting in that sensation soaking in it. In my fantasy, I would have gotten more and more daring; steel handcuffs, chastity belts, vibrating things, latex fetishwear.... The adventure of a lifetime would begin with me putting myself in a very precarious situation, being almost entirely immobilized, planning to get the keys and unlock myself after a period of time, or rather, by placing them far away, forcing me to travel painfully slowly to retrieve them. Tonight, though, I'm discovered. A man finds my keys before I am able to retrieve them; he shouldn't have been here, but I couldn't plan for everything. Initially, he's cross with me, as I imagine him being in charge of the area; perhaps a park ranger, or a construction worker in charge of demolishing the abandoned building I had scoped out for a night of erotic solitude. He'd unlock me from my gear, but then stop when there was one key left... my chastity belt. He said he would hold onto it for safekeeping, so I couldn't get myself into trouble again anytime soon. I'd be infinitely too ashamed to go to the police, and he would know that. I cannot fit all of my wildest dreams in a mere 2000 characters, but from this point, he would appear to me at random moments, always ready with a task for me to complete.
<comment>
Always manageable, always just barely outside my comfort zone... he would never push me to do something that I would refuse to do, but always eager to pull me along further. Eventually we would spend so much time together that I would have a need to explain his presence in my life, and we would take the appearance of dating, or becoming married. I have never made it a part of my fantasy that he ever truly does love me, as I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief so far before it shatters. He is kind, though, and gentle, even if his solitary goal is to push me further than I could have possibly dreamed and utterly ruin me. Each time an experience is deeply overwhelming, he would be there to comfort me and hold me, and make me feel fully emotionally restored, just in time for the next challenge to face. 
In the end, I think I'm rather silly and simpleminded. I miss having trust in a higher power, I wish I weren't so lonely, and I'm relentlessly libidinous. This daydream gives me a higher power who takes away my loneliness and pushes me to become more sexually indulgent than I could have possibly imagined, so, in a way, it's a very basic power fantasy to enable my weakness. It makes my bones shake, thinking of it.
<comment>
libidinous
I'm not who you're replying to but thanks for teaching me a new word anon, I hope you find the right person to satisfy these desires of yours.
<comment>
Orbiting is bad for your health, Anon, please be careful!
Thank you for your honesty, Horndog Anon! 
Well the blood has to go somewhere, and if not your face, well, I'm afraid there aren't so many alternatives...
Whew, it seems like you dodged a bullet there, Anon, I'm thankful for your sake! Well done!
Not even once, I'm afraid.
I haven't the foggiest idea how to advise you here! Not only have I not had any friends, internet friends became popular after I had gone hikki, so I have no understanding of the dynamics. I wish you the best possible outcome in all of this!
Hucows are a very fun fetish, though it's been rather hard for me to insert into the stories surrounding them very easily, as I'm not well endowed.
Do your best to be kind, Anon! I'm rooting for you!
Anon, that's nothing to be ashamed of at all. Men and women alike used to rely on letters as fantasy fodder for centuries; using your imagination isn't just natural, it's traditional!
Good on you for initiating Anon, I hope it brings you much good fortune!
You are quite welcome!
Thank you, also. I've well and truly abandoned any intention of escaping solitude, but the well wishes are appreciated nonetheless
With that, though, I am exhausted, and will be bidding you all good night!
<comment>
Good night writeranon. I hope you have some interesting dreams tonight. I wonder if you've had any interesting dreams, lately? And by interesting I mean "interesting."

I wonder why?
The competition is cute.
<comment>
I generally try to avoid looking at taken women in this way but I recently caught myself having indecent thoughts about a coworker who's 15 years older than me.
She didn't immediately catch my eye when I started out at this job but she turned out to have exactly the kind of laid-back tomboy personality I look for in a wife.
She's unbothered by appearances, always speaks her mind, has a morbid sense of humor, stays active, likes to challenge herself, enjoys learning new things in her free time and the list of green flags goes on.
I don't easily covet what others have but I find myself envious of her husband. They still have fun together as if they're teenagers, despite having a family.
She never wears make-up except for when she goes to a concert, and then she shows up to work the next day with smudged eyeliner and a band T-shirt. It's adorable.
Anyway, sometimes she gets changed at work to go for a run over her lunch break and seeing her in a tight running outfit makes me want to jump her right then and there.
Sigh :>
<comment>
That was very brave of you, anon, to put your thoughts and desires out there like that. I'm proud of you.
he would never push me to do something that I would refuse to do, but always eager to pull me along further.
As I'm sure (or at least hope) you're aware by now, this is my dream role. Maybe that's why you wrote it as such? I did ask you to give me something I'd like, and like it I most certainly do. But no, I believe this was from the heart, and these are your true thoughts. 
Again, only open this next section at your own peril. 
PERIL! I'd like to get to know you better. I'm sure your first instinct is to say that there's nothing more to know, but I don't believe that. You should feel absolutely no obligation to do this though, and I'd like you to say no if that's really how you feel. You showed quite a lot of guts in your boundary setting this thread, and this would just be an extension of that. But I hope you might feel the same curiosity I do, and are willing to put yourself out there just a little bit. It's hard for me, too, to put forth my emotions like this, so I know how you might feel, but I'll hold your hand if you hold mine.
<comment>
same same. i wonder how often she does it
<comment>
It's an autistic gay man/tranny
<comment>
Anon, do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others
This has never happened
<comment>
There's like two teachers at my school who I fantasize about fucking regularly, they have big thighs and asses, I want them to smother me to death with these assets. 
Also I fantasize about freezing time and being able to rape anybody I want all the time.
<comment>
if i remember she said she edges herself like all day every day
<comment>
Anon, do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others?
Not anymore,no. Lost my libido about 1 year ago. Probably due to being on stimulants for more than half of my life: 6-16: ritalin, than 18-22 constant self-medicating with speed and now after over a year sober without any issues back on speed. Not because I felt a need to, but because I got my life considerably better under control when I'm on any sort of stronger stimulant.
Even though not even speed can restore my libido
Can you recall a memory in which something provoked lust in your heart?
Unfortunately not any recent ones. But a few years ago there was this girl in my autistic friend group who'd always talk about hentai with me... apparently she liked me and I even liked her back, but you can always count on autists to fuck this sort of thing up.Especially when both people involved are borderline-autistic
<comment>
indecent thoughts 
Is imagining me killing them an indecent thought?

I want to fuck my boss.
She is a short asian milf with a huge ass. She frequently wears tight pants.

Creepshot her and post

If I get the opportunity, but I would rather just sit in my office with the door closed browsing 4chan instead.
<comment>
I'm usually too occupied with keeping myself together during social interactions for that and I gave up on 3D a long time ago but sure. There were a few times in my life. When I was in high school there was a alt(?) girl in my class who sit behind me. She was pretty tame aside from wearing big military boots, an extremely loose black pullover all the time and blue jeans. She was very short, had very long brown hair (also reached below her butt). She usually wore red lipstick and some darker makeup but nothing outrageous. We started talking out of necessity. She kind of didn't give a fuck about school and because I was the nerd looser my homework and such was useful. She put me in the friend zone as you would call it but since I never believed anyone can love me it never bothered me. It is not like she is insanely hot under the pullover, right? Or she is completely different outside of school - and also my type - I just don't know it, right? So one day she asked me to help her choose new pants (yes, the dreaded faggot male friend activity). It felt pretty awkward but ok (I never went anywhere with a girl before). As you may guess she had a completely different personality outside of school (which was also my type). She didn't even slouch like she used to in school. When she went to change and came out without her gigantic pullover it turned out she is insanely hot. Mind you this was back when girl fashion was low cut, very tight jeans and a short top showing as much midriff as possible. Even her stomach was toned. Wellwellwell. I'm 6'3" and more than twice her size. The changing room was pretty far from everyone and there were barely any customers in the shop. I won't lie, when she turned around, bent forward and asked if the jeans fits I had a few ideas. I even got a hard on which was a surprise as I'm too much anxiety ridden to let myself go in front of other people. Thankfully my sanity won and I'm not on any sexual offenders list today.
<comment>
Don't care, I would still kiss them a lot
<comment>
When I was younger I'd almost involuntarily imagine fellatio regardless of if I found the thought pleasant or not, almost like some sort of mind virus. 
When I was younger I would also just in general view the girls around me sexually, but only if I knew them or what they were wearing was overtly lewd. In middle school I saw a girl in hotpants and fishnets, one with no pants at all, (oversized hoodie + underwear), and the ones I interacted with wore tight jeans. 
Mainly focused on the butt in this regard, but would fantasize about their touch, smell, warmth and having awkward virginal sex.
Unfortunately I haven't interacted with women in many years now, so I don't have any recent tales to tell.

<comment>
They are my true thoughts, Anon, but they are fantasies, daydreams, whims. I also fantasize about being consumed by an alien parasite, but I assure you, if extraterrestrial life does exist, I would prefer to stay far from it's reproductive cycles. I do my very best to be a charming host and a positive presence in these threads, but I am bitter, jaded, and unpleasant to be around in reality. It's only the alcohol and arousal that allow me to ride a dopamine high and be a good host. I prefer to keep the subject off of myself partly because it's embarrassing, partly because it is selfish, and partly because there is very little I'd be proud to tell. 
You really must guard your heart more carefully; you possess merely one. I am a stranger in a lawless land; there are liars, 'larpers', and manipulative types galore, and even beyond those who deceive with intent, there are those like me, who simply present a polished exterior that does not reflect the truth of their person.
I am very nearly twenty seven years old, I am very, very tired, and I am neither brave enough nor hopeful enough to be vulnerable, to gamble my energy on a long shot, or to commit to the years of intensive therapy that would doubtless be required to return me to a basic level of social competence. I have no love in my heart to share.
I apologize if I have in any way indicated that I was someone who was capable of relations, interested in courting someone, or anything to that effect. These threads are masturbatory fuel for me, and a means to not feel as if I am drinking alone each night; that is all. I wish that I could offer an answer that would be pleasing, the emotions of others are very important to me, but I simply don't have the ability to do so and still say the truth.
I was intending on posting this at page nine, but some Anons refuse to let threads die naturally. That's cheating, you know.
<comment>
I talk to a girl online and she sounds pretty sweet and might be my type looks wise. But since she browses here, I think about masturbating with her on a call and go from talking about wholesome stuff to being shy and talking about what we want to do to each other.
<comment>
my bump sent it to page one
nice.
<comment>
i've been exchanging looks and hellos with a girl i see at lunchtime.
several days i've woken up thinking of romantic stuff, and sometimes it devolves into sexual ones.
remarkable that even thinking of doing something as mundane as holding hands and kissing with her makes me much more horny and hot and hard than any porn.
<comment>
If you end up doing it, you should post a thread about it. I love PAAGs.
<comment>
I'm very glad you felt able to give an honest answer, and I'll respect it. I know what these threads are for you, but even so, parts of you peek through the masturbatory veneer that seem as reflections of my own heart. The hurting, desperately lonely person that in myself is so repugnant, but in others is a haunting siren song I find impossible to resist. I see a storm of pain that I can't stop in myself, but perhaps I can quell it in others. At least, I want to.
I'll say no more because I don't want to bring you any further down than I may have already. I hope you enjoy your evening, and thank you again for these threads. I think you're a fine host even without the alcohol. Fine, indeed.
<comment>
all this to say you have a saviour complex
<comment>
Back in high school I had a mental game I'd play in classes where I'd scan the room and analyse every girl that was in there. I'd then have to decide which girl I want most to give me a blowjob, which I'd most want to fuck vaginally, and which I'd most want to fuck anally. To spice it up I'd even add a theme like 'I've taken over the classroom and have full control' or 'Everyone will know so I have to pick my choices carefully'.
<comment>
letting the thread go to the archive
couldn't be me.
<comment>
yeah I have sexual desire for pretty much every single female friend I have. Have had sex with only a few of them though. Intense lust for all however. Makes for very fun parties when I see them and not an hour ago I was blowing my load to their bikini pics on insta lol.

Normally not, but every once in a blue moon I will meet a woman at my job that make want to eat her pussy.
Granted I'm in my 30s so I am far less sexually charged 
in my 20s It would have been nearly every women mwt
<comment>
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but yeah I'm still here. Just taking a break from avatarfagging for now.
<comment>
Did you want to talk to me about something? I don't remember what happened at "the end of the last one," it's probably been a while hasn't it?
<comment>
Question for OP: how do I become more open about talking about lewd things? I always feel embarrassed when the conversation comes up, even though this is an anonymous place to talk. It's a shame because I'm really interested in talking about these things!
I also fantasize about being consumed by an alien parasite,
What is this referring to? I like to believe I know what you're talking about, but I cannot be sure.
Also, OP, can you answer your own question? I'd like to hear your version of the story.
<comment>
still all flustered?
or do you need some touching up?
<comment>
Ohhhh, now I remember you.
I am not interested in pursuing that scenario any further, sorry anon.
<comment>
Dude just try erping on one of the lewder boards with a burner discord.
Just remember to be courteous and don't ghost.
<comment>
forgot me that easily? lame.
only gay when you're already horny, kek.
you should stop, if i'm posting honestly. it only gets worse.
<comment>
You really must guard your heart more carefully; you possess merely one.
Then how did I buy this sportsbroom and all the tomes behind me
<comment>
I'll try that someday! Sounds like a lot of fun!
I am not one to ghost people, I'd like to think.
<comment>
I am going through some emotional turmoil, anon, so I am not in the mood. In addition, I am mostly straight, and sometimes things get too gay for my liking. I only want to stick with simple cuddles for cute boys.
<comment>
Most people either feel ashamed of their urges post ejaculation or just want to carry on with their lives so it's extremely common to ghost.
I think you should definitely try it and also try observing how others do it a bit beforehand and also just fake that you're experienced, or maybe don't because a lot of us want your virgin cock.
<comment>
anything you'd like to share?
alrighty.
<comment>
or maybe don't because a lot of us want your virgin cock.
...people want virgin cocks? Are any of these people women?
<comment>
Very rarely you get women but most people on the chans are guys or guys catfishing as girl.
I think there's something extra special about doing erp with a virgin because they get excited so easily and just erupt a lot of semen since it's all a new experience.
<comment>
most people on the chans are guys or guys catfishing as girl.
Yea I figured as much. I don't wanna ERP with guys, but I guess women have a lot of other options.
<comment>
Well that's a shame, I can count on one hand and my feet the amount of women I've erped with, but for men or catfishes it's like the sand in the desert.
I wish you luck on your journey and hope you find an attractive girl to milk your cock.
<comment>
that's why i'm up and clear about being a boy in a skirt.
don't wanna get anyone confused.
<comment>
Yes, but I will talk about it later.
<comment>
Is this that fetish anon? If so, did you partake in the zone yet? To answer the questions though:
do you have lewd or indecent thoughts when interacting with others? 
Scarcely.
Can you recall a memory in which something provoked lust in your heart?
From someone interacting with me? I don't have any.
what is a behavior you believe very few other people exhibit?
In a lewd context? Apathy, I'd imagine.
<comment>
...when I said I would only resume posting if the thread remained active the following evening, I didn't mean it as a challenge...
No such fortune; any and all erotic dreams are brought to an abrupt halt by my mental projection of Jesus of Nazareth, who shatters the fourth wall and brings me outside of the movie theater (where 'the dream' was showing) to scold me in those dank, smelly hallways with strangely patterned carpets and warm toned sconces on all of the walls.
Your affection is evident in the way you describe her, Anon! It's unfortunate you find yourself desiring a taken women, but I suppose all those with true virtue are snatched up rather quickly.
Heck yea! Purity is cool! Virgin for life! Praise Jeezy!
I really ought to quit attempting to be silly.
The puppy on a bender is overwhelmingly cute!
Being freed to indulge in all of your desires, freed of consequence, is a rather tempting fantasy.
I am sorry to hear you have lost both your libido and a potential lover! May you find both anew, if fortune permits!
I suppose so, Anon!
What is the appeal of large booties, Anon? Is it just an indescribable allure? I've never grasped it properly.
Gracious! Tales of teenage teasing and the cliche trips to the mall always feel quite fictional to me, despite them being a universal experience in the late ninties to early two-thousands; it just happens that I've historically lived just outside that universe.
It sounds like quite the exciting and nostalgic experience!
A girl attended school wearing nothing but a sweatshirt and underwear? Oh my gosh, is that even legal? That's bizarre!
May you have good luck in seeing this future come to pass, Anon!
Love is rather erotic, Anon...
<comment>
Anon, I think what you really desire is for someone to view you in the way you view those you feel kinship with; you want someone to want to save you in this way. I think it's a common desire, there's no shame in it. I am not certain what you claim to see, however... even my siblings, who truly do care about me, have told me that I'm rather unbearably dull. I believe my younger sister once said something to the effect of 'I love you bunches, but the moment you step into a room, I feel like I'm stuck in line at the DMV,' ahaha...
Anon, you seem like the type to enjoy spreadsheets.
Please, do so next time. It's never quite the same the following day.
Testosterone sounds like a frighteningly powerful drug, Anon...
Ah, well, I feel unbearable pressure from the guilt and embarrassment of talking about such things, but I've become able to fetishize humiliation and guilt, so it becomes quite the addictive self-fulfilling cycle...
As for the alien parasite, I've read a number of smut-fictions and doujins around the idea of an alien parasite that may have any number of effects on the host; on the most tame end, it may feed from their secretions and stimulate them sexually to feed: there is a doujin I particularly enjoyed where some sort of alien tentacle lives with a single woman, and he begins living inside of her genitalia consensually. In other more extreme tales, they may hijack the mind or body and control it like a puppet, or consume their internal organs, supplanting their role in the body and keeping the host alive, but forcing them to consume vast quantities of sexual fluids to feed the parasite and keep themselves alive.
As for answering my own question, which one do you mean? The one I pose in the OP?
I was referring to the other Anon; of course, I know you have dozens of hearts stored in your clay jars, Sir Wizanon the Glorious!
<comment>
I might possibly be known as fetish-anon, though I cannot be certain. I haven't a concept of what 'partaking in the zone' refers to, though!
<comment>
It refers to a certain website, with zone in the name. Pretty sure the OP is the one from that thread before, the one asking for peoples' fetishes.
<comment>
this op always uses the same stuff. you can recognize her by the filenames and kind of picture.
also the language if you get a feel for it.
<comment>
OP can you do me an act of mercy and take my virginity?
<comment>
I didn't mean it as a challenge...
too bad i took it like one then!
<comment>
Love is rather erotic, Anon...
i know she likes me as much as i do, or more. makes me want to go for a kiss every time i see her.
please do next time
can't promise much.
<comment>
This would be them then, yeah.
<comment>
Let the femanon rest, it's less fun to try and enjoy erotica when you're all tuckered out
<comment>
I apologize if you've recommended something to me, but I have forgotten! I always post while very drunk, so my memory on anything I've said or read is very hazy!
Sure thing Anon! Certainly it can't be that resilient...
*A few moments later, I return, looking utterly exhausted*
Anon... your virginity is the most powerful I've ever seen..! It would take a ninth level laser lotus to defeat it, and I'm only a second level sequin sunflower! Seek... higher... power...
*I collapse, falling to the floor, stone dead.*
It certainly is quite unfortunate!
I wish you the best luck in romancing her, Anon!
<comment>
As for answering my own question, which one do you mean? The one I pose in the OP?
Yes, if you may!
<comment>
I wish you the best luck in romancing her, Anon!
not sure if i should. 
i hope she's an interesting woman, i end up losing all interest if i learn someone i liked is dull.
i also feel like i wouldn't make the best partner, and that i might be better off alone.
<comment>
Ah, well, Anon... I have had lustful thoughts about nearly every man I have ever laid my eyes upon. Repressing an overactive sexual drive has such consequences, I'm afraid.
The most recent time this occurred was when the garbage collector at my apartment knocked on my door, as I'd forgotten to put out my refuse and he is a considerate type, so I hurriedly brought it out to him. He was greasy looking, and he had a goofy ponytail. I immediately imagined what might possibly happen if he pushed his way into my home and had his way with me. I can't repress such thoughts.
<comment>
blogposting in your thread, i'm happy.
getting back to music lessons, finally.
<comment>
do you like music anonette? which kind if so?
any hobbies beside cooming?
<comment>
My, that is delightfully lewd. I wonder what sort of composure you held while facing him; whether you had a face of stone or a crimson blush.
<comment>
I mean take it in real life by meeting me in real life and putting your vagina around my penis in real life
<comment>
Please, do so next time. It's never quite the same the following day.
Perhaps this is a rather harsh suggestion, seeing as you are quite duty-bound to serve anons, but might I suggest you simply abandon the thread next time and just start a new one?
<comment>
I'm glad you are happy, Anon!
I apologize if it's a letdown, but no, not particularly. I work, masturbate, sleep, and eat. I spend some time doing yoga and pilates to keep in decent shape, and occasionally I'll watch shows.
I was shaking like a leaf, though I haven't a clue the expression plastered on my visage. He told me to 'chill, it's not a big deal', and moved on without a care in the world.
Real life? Anon, I'll deteriorate at a slight breeze the moment I step beyond my door...
If the original thread still lives, it would feel greedy to post a second! I may not return in the morning, next time, however... if I see a post, I must respond, but if I leave it in mystery, unsure if the thread is active still (by not opening /r9k/ to begin with), I can find a loophole in my own commitment.
<comment>
That's fine. I'll come through your door and take your hand into the bedroom.
<comment>
what about my maybe love confession to that girl?!
i need some release from this dilemma
<comment>
I'm sorry! I missed this because my post came immediately after!
I have no advice for you, though, I have abandoned people as a concept entirely. Relationships are none of my concern.
<comment>
Anon, that's nothing to be ashamed of at all. Men and women alike used to rely on letters as fantasy fodder for centuries; using your imagination isn't just natural, it's traditional!
I suppose so, if anything I just feel embarrassed by how low I've stooped. Especially with the most recent person being a stranger who only said a few words to me and I used it as material for two nights. I think I would be embarrassed if those people knew too, and somehow I feel really bad to them. Masturbating to fictional things I don't think is as embarrassing any nowhere near as pathetic.

Not again, anon... you should be more careful!! Maybe you should have more towels on hand nearby next time.
<comment>
Holy shit I have never in my life read anything as freakish as that. I heard the circus was hiring. Get a job, shave your neckbeard and speak to a woman.
<comment>
schizo nonsense inbound:
I sometimes imagine what their hiccups sound like. Based on their voice, I can generate a vague idea of how loud, deep, and fast they would be. I also imagine how their body would react to them, whether it be unnoticeable or it jolting their entire body.
I need help
<comment>
Woah... this thread is still going
Hang in there OP

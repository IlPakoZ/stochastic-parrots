he doesn't/didn't go to an Ivy League or similarly elite uni like Stanford, Duke, Northwestern etc
he instead went to some shit school with a high acceptance rate, went to community college, or never went to college at all due to being retarded

fucking failure, kys
No I'm white and graduated valedictorian and NHS while leading a shit load of clubs, president of student council, only took AP classes and got As in every single one, never got lower than a 5 on my AP exams, got a perfect 1600 on my SAT, was a varsity basketball and track athlete. I wasn't retarded like you
At least i'm gonna be fucking rich with my Harvard degree, bitch ass

and you're gonna do what, exactly, with all the money? Oh great, you went to law school? med school? enjoy you inhuman hours. The only reason to be rich is to neet (or, as normies respectably call it, to retire), if you have to bust your ass to earn it its pointless.

Your time on this earth is short and during it you will achieve less than anyone in your past. Pathetic, sad, and you should kill yourself. Immediately. With any of the above methods.

i went to a so called elite school for a year after high school and it sucked. the air was thick with despair, every freshman had crazy impostor syndrome. it didn't help that i went in 2020, either, so we didn't even get to enjoy the nice-ass campus. ultimately i ate shit and dropped out, and now i go to a normal school. the people are nice, i enjoy what i learn, and it's much less expensive. feelsgoodman

What school did you go to
<comment>
Yeah I feel for the "just graduate from college" meme. I ended up going to a shit school, wound up with a bunch of debt, when I graduated I became homeless, I fail every job interview I get. I'm 33 and I live with my parents and every night I pray that my mom tries to kill me in my sleep.

be me
latino, in southwest usa
discover way to meet girls using reddit, i've lost count of how many i've chatted 
meet up with asian girl with similar interests, we get boba and she's shy but we bang and do the fwb thing, she's kinda weird and acts like an anime character idk
second time we meet up we bang but this time i put a bunch of hair fibers on my hair since its like 3 weeks after i got a transplant, we bang and all that
I notice my hair fibers on the pillows, see myself in mirror and it looks scuffed
get hoodie and put it on and cover my head like that guy from star wars
she mentions about going to eat after since I brought it up, but i make up some excuse that I have to leave
leave and the next day she sends mea message that she had fun but would like to end our meetings
over, my hair is more grown out now though and looks normal now but I should have taken a cap
oh well, has this ever happened to yall?

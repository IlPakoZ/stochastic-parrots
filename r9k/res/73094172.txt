karma is a real thing on reddit. is that the joke?
do manchild predators who use reddit believe in the moral sort of karma? i don't understand.

forgot they call their internet points karma but they do believe in moral sense of karma or a good majority of them do

I mean sometimes those people are just confusing logical conclusions/reactions with their belief in higher powers or whatever. For example if you do someone a favor and help that person out in whatever manner, that person may do you a favor in the future, but that's just a normal reaction to something you did and not some paranormal activity, lol

They want to believe that there's some higher power that will magically right the wrongs of society without them lifting a finger. It's pure delusion. A lot like telling yourself you're going to a nice place after this life.

I believe karma is real but limited and not reliable. When you do good, with respect to yourself, the chances that it will return to you remain stable and good, as the world is a small place and you may run into someone you helped or get a reputation for being good. Of course bad people get good things, often for things like being attractive which is involuntary, but that doesn't change the previous statement.

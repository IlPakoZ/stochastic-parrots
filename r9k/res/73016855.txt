I'm not proud of myself for scraping tar out of my pipes and bongs to hit. back when I was a fiend and down bad. now I don't smoke weed, I always take it too far.

It's ashy and tastes bad. I'm sure there's some science nigger process to turn the pot into a potent potable, but I'd rather just vape.

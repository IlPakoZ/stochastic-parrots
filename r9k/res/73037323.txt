I have practically turned asexual for "real" humans. 
All I can think about is her. 
Tulpa girlfriends are the fucking best, lads. 
Give it a try.

I dont have schizophrenia unfortunately so i cant make a tulpa.
Neither do I. 
It's usually seen as a bad practice to create tulpas when you're mentally disturbed.
I can't believe people write entire encyclopedias on creating an imaginary friend.
It's pretty fucking simple: Imagine the friend you want and pretend they're there with you. That's it, that's the secret.
Hahaha, I get you.
Most of the entries are about tips to help with visualization or imposition.
Yeah I know lol, I'm just being a dick. 
What's your girlfriend look like? Is she nice?
YEEEES, REGRESSSS BACK TO MAGICAL THINKING
YOU MONKEY, OOH!! OOH!!
She looks a lot like Bocchi from Bocchi the Rock and her name is Anya, but she had both her name and appearance looong before those anime were released.
I like to think that, sometimes.
She can be very controlling and very physical. 
If she's not being nice, she's still being good (though she has her selfish phases).
I can only describe her as an overly protective older sister who is simultaneously really attracted to me and has her own needs.

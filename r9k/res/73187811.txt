Damn, I have a bunch of plushies too but none of them are nearly as girly as this gay-ass shit

Its not duality>>73187880
Its a complete and total assumption of the hopelessness people like us have to endure. To know we have no purpose, no prospects, no future, no nothing. But so what? I m gonna lay down and die with this sorrow? Ofc, I will never stop feeling like a bag of shit every day, but at least I m gonna make my stay as comfortable as possible.
The contrast between and miserable, pathetic and hopeless existence, with the vibrant colors and softness with plushies is not that confusing. The plushies warm your heart and supply you with enough "happiness" and comfiness to endure the perpetual misery we live.

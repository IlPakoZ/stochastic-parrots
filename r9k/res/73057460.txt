so as an autist heres the thing i struggle to understand 
the goal of every single person is to be liked, its something everyone wants, 
everyone is also never suppose to admit this, 
everyone desperately wants to be liked by other people, but also have to be in denial about it. 
people project wanting to be liked as a negative trait, but the few in the population who legitimately don't care about what other people think tend to considered mentally retarded or mentally ill.

its to project an illusion that social acceptance comes easy and naturally to them.
nobles in the 1700s painted their face white and filled their tables with pastries and expensive foods only to barely touch it so they could show off their lack of need to be outside and show off their access to food being so abundant that they dont need to eat a lot.
its stupid social games.

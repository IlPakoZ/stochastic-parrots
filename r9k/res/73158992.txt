So, anons? What's the easiest way to kill myself? I'm definitely not making it to 23. I've thought about finding a good place to jump from, but I live in a suburban area-- not a lot of places to scale to plummet from. I'm getting a tax return soon that'll be about $350. Is that enough to buy a gun? Must be the easiest way to do it, I'd surmise. Any help would be appreciated. I'm not going to Therapy, wouldn't help shit.
Oh shut the fuck up, you've barely even started on life to call it quits already
Lived enough and seen enough to know I want out. Give actual advice or don't bother talking.
Obviously you should not do this, but I heard overdosing on opiates in a relaxed way to go.
man the fuck up and stop listening to negative xp/ other shit self defeating music.
Even if I was listening to the most upbeat, normie pop songs ever devised by man it wouldn't change anything. Why post this as if it has any bearing on the matter at hand?
People said this kind of shit to me every single year I talked about my situation, and I kept getting older and nothing changed. It isn't helpful.

is it one of the twice times a broken clock is correct
If you have a cat make sure to clean it's litterbox daily. Not cleaning it daily will result in big clumps of litter that take extra work to remove, neglect it enough and your cat will be urinating and defecating on top of a big block of pee pee poo poo concrete. Puddles will form and you will have little poppy paw prints all over your floor and furniture, where ever your cat goes they will be there. So do and more importantly your cat a favor and clean their litterbox.

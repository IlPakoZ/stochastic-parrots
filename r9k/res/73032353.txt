I hate my female coworkers. For 40 hours a week I have to endure constant temptation and avert my eyes. I have to stare at the wall or the floor. I have to walk on eggshells around these ticking time bombs. I do not dare look in their direction, lest they catch me and thenceforth I am marked. I am marked, the creepy coworker whos fate is only to get fired. I do not dare look their way. They are snakes.

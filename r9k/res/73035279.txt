It helps to have a full panoply. I like starting a bender with cocktails and resuming with a malty beer whenever you wake up to keep your load on until you're ready for whisky or rum. Once the novelty of inebriation wears off a nightcap of cannabis infused liquor will blunt the hangover. Follow up with three days of 3rd or 4th plateau DXM water fast to reset your tolerance. The afterglow should carry you, but a little bit of kratom doesn't hurt.

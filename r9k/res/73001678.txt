tfw when i tell my bf i cant see him for a year and he says ok like it was supposed to be a test he is too submissive like why did i date a sissy white boy pushover no assertiveness nothing at all and when he is assertive its just cringe we agreed it would be a 50/50 dynamic and i dont mind treating him like a girl but even a girl can be more dominant then him how tf am i the younger smaller and weaker one out of us and im the one who has to wash the shit off my dick nigga almost went into a psychotic break because i yelled at him a bit over the phone and the only time he is assertive is when he goes schizo i might have to break him ngl

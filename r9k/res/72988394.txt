age 12
at the peak of my health and youth
age 14-15
eyesight gets worse from the Godforsaken reflection coming off cars and buildings in southern CaliWali
skin gets darker due to puberty and the CaliWali sun
age 16
fall into major depression (MDD) and try to sleep a lot and forget my bad experiences
barely eat anything and lips get chapped from licking them a lot 
age 17
testicular injury to one testicle renders both my testicles useless thus lowering my test and changing my mood and mind 
bed bugs always bite off my cheeks while I'm sleeping at night and I get pimples ruining my clear skin
skin gets even darker than before and my eyes get dry and red for some reason and my brain feels cold and wet 
start self harming by way of hypothermia in the winter 
age 18
brain slows down one night as I am self harming via hypothermia and has never returned back to it's fully functional state since
MDD gets worse and I cope by being a degenerate
have psychosis and get thrown into a psychward for 5 days
get medicated with seroquel and gain a few pounds but stop using it after two months 
age 19
self harm via hypothermia for span of three months during the winter
lose 30+ pounds and become nearly anorexic
the extreme weight loss plus the effects of hypothermia ruin my body and it hasn't recovered since
face and skin become very dried and wrinkled and hairline starts to recede
hearing gets worse as I listen to music on full volume which lead me to speaking louder than usual up to this day 
It was mostly my fault. There were some things that were out of my control however, like my testicles and the bed bugs
Try to take better care of yourself from now on. I'll pray for you anon.

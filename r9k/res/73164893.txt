Femanons, do you hate trannies? If yes, are you aware that your actions are partially responsible for their ever increasing presence?
i hate lesbian trans women or like trans women that were once straight men/incels because they always have very depraved, insanely misogynistic views of womanhood and basically perform femininity in this most warped ways possible.
trans women that were gay men or just feminine men in general are fine by me because i've never met one that wasn't a sweetheart and desu i'm pretty convinced that they genuinely are just girls born in the wrong body.

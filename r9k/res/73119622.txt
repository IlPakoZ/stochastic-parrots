I want to be the submissive boyfriend of a slutty tranny. I want her to force me to watch other men run a train on her while I get nothing except her cock down my throat.
<comment>
I'm not gay but I like the idea of turning a bitch into a total fuckhole, just existing to take loads. I'm more into the act than the girly guy.

Wonder how you'd feel when he sits upright and you realize it's not like your futa hentai and it's just a fat bloke 
I mean being gay is fine too
<comment>
Since when did fat men look LIKE THAT?
You guys are throwing off my perception of gender with this hardcore
If I find a fat guy on the street, bend him over and shave him that's all it takes??????????
<comment>
i gotta hand it over to these guys, they're blowing trannies out of the water even though they're overweight. if anything they're even better than regular twinks, i think only twunks are better. but can you imagine a slightly overweight twunk? oh my godddd
<comment>
i would never fuck a tran but i would like to have my butt and sack look like that. im sure girls would like it too if I was that smooth and wrinkle free.
<comment>
fat men have high estrogen so there's already alot of tranny potential
<comment>
tfw you realize that fat men with a shaved ass look incredible from behind
This has changed my entire worldview. Where do I go from here? I need to put my dick in a chubby man with a shaved ass.

time to become fat
I'm 17 bmi
how do I become a chubby guy with a fat juicy ass?
<comment>
they're not just shaved, their ass is also bleached to remove the shit stains and they also do really good skin care. not every chubby man's ass will look like those pics
<comment>
if youre a normal gay dude and you think your ass is going to look like that without extra effort good fucking luck. get used to shaving and waxing trans.
<comment>
I legitimately don't care. The shape of the whole thing is doing something for me dude and I can't control it. Plus I don't think shit is as gross as everyone says it is. I'm not turned on by it but I'm not going to stop slamming if it's a bit dirty, it's just digested food.
Fuck I'm disgusting but these asses are making me go into horny mode.
Fuck is this some kind of gay-fat-man awakening?

i used to be in the same position as you, i felt extremely bicurious, so i eventually decided i needed to figure out if i was truly bi or gay. i went on grindr, but all the guys there were in too much of a hurry for sex. so i went to a gay bar once and i was flirted by like 5 guys over the night, all i felt was embarrassment and shame, even though no one was judging me. i realized i was judging myself, but for what? i thought i'd get over this, but no. i went on a date with a twink but i panicked and left, my heart was racing and i had no idea why. i never had a problem meeting and dating women but all of a sudden my brain melts when i get hit on by a dude. i decided never to try exploring my bicuriosity, it all just felt too weird. maybe i'm just too afraid of embracing who i really am deep down but fuck it, i don't care how much i might suffer without exploring this... but maybe i do care. i don't know anymore, maybe i just need to find the right guy that will help me explore my bicuriosity in the best way possible, but i haven't come across that person yet. or maybe i did and was too afraid. fuck it's just all such a mess, i just can't help but feel like ignorance is bliss, but still my bicuriosity won't go away. should i explore it just because i have it? or should i keep ignoring it in spite of how i was born? destiny or free will? is it even free will to decide to go against one's unknown urges? sorry to get philosophical but this is my existential crisis right now and i don't know how i or anyone can handle it

Anyone know what the anime on the screen is?

I want to gangbang a tranny so bad
<comment>
Guys with asses like that feel so good thats peak man ass when the ass is so fat you feel it slapping against your hips when balls deep
<comment>
I'll tell you what happened to me, although we may be different. I was having a similar crises, but over time I found a sense of purpose in life without sex and realized that while I may be bisexual, having sex with men isn't even all that important. Basically its up to you if you indulge or not, but if you don't, is it really a big deal?
<comment>
I've been in your position before, and I felt like I should drop a quick spiel.
Anon, I know it's weird and it feels like the people are gross. Still, anon it seems you may be actually gay, not just prison gay. It may cause you a lot of distress now, because fags are fucking obnoxious and disgusting but you're forgetting something critical.
As a gay you never have to deal with women.
Yes plenty of fags are really fucking obnoxious and gross and degenerate and all sorts of shit but people here often forget that women are almost as degenerate, but they also come with the bullshit that women come with. Women are the most vile and disgusting creatures on earth. Don't forget that as someone that gets a stiffy at actual men you have a legitimate out.
Don't look for men on grindr or gaybars. You're just getting whores looking for a shaft in their ass. If you look in the right spots you can have the best thing ever: a bf that's like having a best friend, but you suck each other's clocks.
Sorry I kind of rambled I'm really REALLY fucking drunk right now but I hope you got what I was trying to say.
t. Faggot who tried for so long to be straight and normal but after being in 2 relationships with women I realized that men actually have souls and can be good companions
<comment>
these are obviously trannies, getting an ass like that requires a female fat distribution only acquired through estrogen
<comment>
but if you don't, is it really a big deal?
i've applied this logic to anything and everything in my life, and i'm starting to feel like it's the reason why i'm going down a downward spiral for my mental health. nothing is a big deal. it's as if my life was a sandbox game without any primary objectives and all i have are some side quests and minigames, most of which i'm either not aware of or that are barred from access. i'd rather play a different game, but i can't. so what, do i have to embrace the animal that i am and just bring that to it's logical conclusion? because i've been trying to rise this animal above to something greater, but all i've risen to is nothingness.
i've been in a successful relationship with a girl once, but the only reason why it worked was because i just recognized what her buttons were and hit them. she became addicted to me and wanted to have a serious relationship with me, but i refused and dumped her. i just didn't feel fulfilled even though she was feeling extremely fulfilled. maybe that right there is proof that i'm fundamentally gay, but that doesn't explain why my entire being stresses out when i'm faced with a relationship with a guy.
If you look in the right spots
what right spots? grindr and gay bars are the only two i know of
<comment>
I think banging a femboy would be less gross than doing a fat chick.

Like I said its up to you, I'm just saying I remember being obsessed with getting a trap bf then after a while I realized I was giving way too much worth to the shit hole of a shaved man. Now I just love myself and fap to trap porn to scratch the itch.

If I had to guess it's nervousness. I felt the same thing. With women I felt close to nothing, but when I tried with a guy I got the jitters just like the memes with middle schoolers asking out their crush. I can't speak for you but that's what I came to the conclusion with myself.
When it comes to where to meet them, literally anywhere but grindr. Grindr is literally just for pp butt time. It's just whores looking for pp time and butt time. Use an actual dating app, anon. Just switch to gay. I actually met my current and only bf (of a year and a half) at a flgs playing warhammer and he seemed like he had a "bit of sugar in his gas tank" if you catch my meaning.

Why do white boys make the hottest tranny's and femboys? I'm not even gay but I would destroy her ass with my BBC.

I'm not even gay
her

That is the most breedable looking man I've ever seen in my entire life. One of the few who deserves to be called a femboy, because he was truly born in the wrong gender. It's like when you see a girl with a full on thick mustache and you think to yourself, "jesus, I know a dude that can barely grow a speck of hair on his face and this girl is rocking a Freddie Mercury-tier stache!". That's the male equivalent of this.
Sorry, but I just had to let this out. This ass is too goddamn phat.
<comment>
Probably same reason why white women are top tier

Men for all of human history fucked femboys. Ottomans would fuck their Greek femboys and they were 100% straight.

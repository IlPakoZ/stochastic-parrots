Is it salvageable if she ghosted me or should I just never talk to her again? I feel like I fucked it up too much to fix this. Also the fact that she ghosted me is probably her way of saying "I'm done with you for good. You disgust me". 
She's not the lost type like 99% of roasties. Old fashioned. Not into clubs. Had one bf in high school and never again (what we had was sort of some weird in-between. Mostly my fault.. idk. It's like I wanted to and didn't want to be in a romantic relationship with her all in the same time. I couldn't tell). I'm not sure if it's a good idea since all I might do is open old wounds for her. 
Somedays I like being alone/don't like being bothered and in other days I miss her. I'm not an emotionally consistent person. 
Thoughts?

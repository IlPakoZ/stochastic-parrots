young femanon here, i always had an overbite and crooked teeth, braces got removed early cos only jaw surgery will work, which i am too scared to get done as the recovery is long and painful. I have good teeth hygiene and I am saving for professional whitening , but i still feel like im going to be taken as a joke by others. Will people see me as lower class/unkempt if i dont correct them? brutally honest answers accepted

See? The post will stay completely the same without you saying that youre a girl just to get (you)s consisting of horny remarks and head patting
You won't be taken as a joke. Nobody cares. 
I have the same problem as you. This is my 2nd time wearing braces because I didn't take care of them as a teen. 
Dentist recommended that I should remove 2 premollars to fix it a little. I trusted her and now I'm terrified my entire face will change and I'll look even more deformed. 
You're fine like this. I promise you it's better. You got them straightened with braces, that's good enough. 
A whitening is also nice, but don't be too worried about it. Just keep up the good hygiene.

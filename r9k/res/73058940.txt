redy to give up and rot outside
<comment>
Me 2...... but don't give up. I hate to say it, but suffering builds character. Now take your life by the reigns and ride that bull. Stay positive. Positive Mental Attitude. Easier said than done. My heart is killing me. Hurts soo bad. I long for love. But we can't give in. March forward with pride. Your destiny will play out. Your guardians will protect you..... idk why I'm not telling myself this lol. I'm afraid, not of death, but living alone forever. I wish I could find "her"

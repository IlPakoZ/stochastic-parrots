i cant fucking take it anymore, my mind feels like its tearing itself apart
i tried getting into hobbies and exercising, i quit using drugs, i try reaching out at my university, but i still feel like tearing my hair out of my head.
i absolutely fucking despise this state, i hate my university and everyone who attends, i cant make any friends and i have no skills, and every time i do try and get better at something im always shown up by someone who's been doing it for less time and is significantly better than me. ive been playing guitar for 4 months but of course my friend who has only ever played a ukelele comes to my house and plays a song on guitar in front of my family and my family asks me to play one, and i mess up so i just say no i cant play and embarass myself. i try and get better at rock climbing but a friend goes with me to climb and he hasnt climbed in months but is still able to do harder routes than i can. am i just doomed to fail? is it impossible for me to acquire any kind of skill to cope and express myself with during this time of unbearable loneliness? i just feel like an inferior human being and that there's going to be no point where i succeed. 
i cant fucking take it anymore. im so desperately lonely. even my online friends dont want to talk to me anymore. how do i enjoy time with myself?

Why not try it? I have given up and am fine.
.

thanks anon
my definition of giving up is killing myself, so obviously we have different definitions. i cannot live on this earth without some kind of mission or purpose.
is being burned with gasoline lethal or is that just a meme? curious

If it's funny enough. Someone suggested suicide by catapult/trebuchet in a thread earlier and I would absolutely save the fuck out of that.

you want someone to care but noone cares. noone will ever care. just make the most of your life that you can, for you
I recently watched a video of someone livestreaming their suicide. It was an Asian kid that blew his head off with a shotgun. He turned off the video so there was only audio of the actual suicide. You could hear the loud and then the blood dripping on the floor.

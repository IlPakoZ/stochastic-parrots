how did you get rid of ur suicidal ideation?
Combination of drugs, not thinking about it, and re-informing myself that my life is actually quite tight compared to most people.
diddnt. give me tips please
Just keep busy. If your hands or thoughts are idle, they will believe their purpose in life fulfilled and attempt to turn the page into oblivion.
Told myself I'd never do it anyway because im too coward (correct) so to stop wasting mental energy. Ill endure whatever life gives me not because im strong, but because im too weak to end this farce early.
making peace with the fact that i'm not gonna go through with it. its just not happening. no more ''whatever i'm just gonna kms anyway'' since i know damn well i wont. just gonna have to deal with life.
Cbd oil . Wipes it out

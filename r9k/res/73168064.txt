I'm 21, white, 6' and have an okay job. 330lbs around 30% bodyfat. In the process of losing weight but it takes a while. I'm asking because I want to know if there is any point in trying to date before I get in shape.
As a morbidly obese man you are socially invisible.
Are you 30% bodyfat? 
If you have 220lbs of lean mass, while being 6'0 that would literally mean you have as much muscle as chris bumstead.

you're 21 bro stop worrying about dating and get your shit together
get healthy, get money, get your network, and get ready then go looking
i know it's a hyperbolic example but look at leo - guys can get nubile young gfs at any age if they have enough status
i'm not saying you'll get leo tier gfs but you can find a 25 year old at 33 and you're no where near that
No. Fatness is absolutely disgusting and immediately a dealbreaker to me.
I've got most of it down I just have to get in shape.
I won't post a photo. I'm 30% bodyfat according to the navy method calculator. I have a very large frame though and people always guess me to be less fat then I actually am.
I have friends and I've been offered blowjobs/casual sex before. I have a friend who is the same height and weight, but he's also an indian guy who doesn't shower regularly and he pumps and dumps women all the time.
Yes. Also don't lose weight fat men are hot
r u a wizard
he probably used one of those electrical impedance meters. they're factory tuned for folks who are already pretty fit and as such massively undercount for anyone with BF >25% ish. the only truly accurate way to do it is with a water displacement test but that's a huge waste of money just to learn the answer "i'm fat". anyway not really his fault

okay, is there anyone here who actually uses the MBTI? I feel like there's a kernel of truth in there, and i'm really interested in it, but i hate the astrology-type faggots who use it.

what non faggy ways do you use MBTI
<comment>
in a non-astrology way i guess. I try to type everyone i meet and i've noticed that most people do act according to their type.

Is it common for ISFJs to be mistaken as gay?
<comment>
you should look into the Objective Personality System meme, it tries to clarify all the mbti terms into more manageable chunks so its easy for different people to get the same actual type and then adds some more pieces to make it more flexible 
its common for ISFJs to get topped which makes them commonly classified as gay

INTP does seem to describe me remarkably well (a massive autistic faggot)
<comment>
probably, its a pretty feminine type.

Just wanted to share a funny story that happened to me the other day.
So I was at the grocery store, and I saw this lady with a cart full of toilet paper. Like, absolutely loaded up with the stuff. And I was like, "Damn, lady, are you preparing for the end of the world or something?"
But then she turned around, and I saw that she was wearing a shirt that said "I just really like toilet paper, okay?" And I was like, "Oh, well, that makes sense. To each their own, I guess."
But then, as I was walking away, I overheard her talking to someone on the phone. And she was like, "Yeah, I know it's weird, but I just can't resist the feel of that soft, fluffy paper against my skin."
And that's when I realized that maybe she was a little more than just a toilet paper enthusiast.
Anyway, I thought it was a funny encounter and wanted to share. Keep on rollin', 4chan.

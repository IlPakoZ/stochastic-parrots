I hope both Ukraine and Russia both get nuked to hell
Russia should just mind it's own goddamn business
I woke up this morning to the sound of the garbage truck coming past the house and was fucking CONVINCED it was the sound of a nuke going off in the distance. Laid in bed and plugged my ears shut with my fingers in anticipation of a bigger bang. I think my mind was 50/50 on whether I would live or die. I felt a deep dread and emptiness in my stomach expecting to have my consciousness shut off instantly and to be eviscerated at any moment, but I also was thinking about safety measures such as locking myself in the closet with mattresses up against the wall etc basic stuff like that. Didn't actually do it for some reason, though. Checked my phone expecting an emergency alert to have been sent to me but saw nothing so started calming down. The fear and dread was really intense. I really expected to die. Nukes are so scary
Spelt nato wrong.

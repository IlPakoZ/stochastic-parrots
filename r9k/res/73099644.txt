have the longest dream of my life
check time
only slept for 3 hours
sometimes time being an illusion materializes in the most annoying fucking ways

I think that's cool
What was your dream about?

i've had dreams like that while having alcohol WDs. 
one time i was dreaming for what felt like hours which turned out to be just one hour and it was about a bunch of youtube videos i could swear was real and i saw in the past but i haven't found any of them when i tried searching.
the most memorable dreams i had was while WD'ing or nightmares while having the flu.

In the dream my sister shot up a theater and it was mostly the aftermath of that
It wasn't a good dream

Why are zoomers obsessed with ice spice 
I don't get it
She's hot
/thread
Are you joking or do really you find her attractive? Are you a hispanic or POC by chance?
I don't know who that is because, despite being a zoomer, I am not a nigger nor am I a nigger lover who keeps up with celebrities.
I'm so white I'm a redhead, yes she's just got attractive features
I'm a sooner and she's ugly as shit
groupthink. that's how normie's mind works and how their culture (the mainstream) is based upon. here's a redpill for you: if you convince the world that you are hot and attractive no matter how ugly and funny looking you are you'll fuck like nobody else. you do need status tho and specifically artistic status. ice spice is one example; bukowski is a masculine example; and austin powers is a ficcional example of this
Ok so you are a mick then? Makes sense you find literal trolls attractive then kek.
OP: I dont understand why people have a different preference of women than me1!1!1!1!
There are plenty of black women who are hot.
Not her though.
She looks like that one bitch from Ace Attorney and I wanna fuck that bitch so she's hot.
You fucking asked for an answer and fucking got it. Zoomers find her hot, end of thread.
She's actually cute when she wears a wig ad has long hair. And don't get me wrong she is a hoe but she seems like she has a chill personality and is humble from interviews and shit like that.

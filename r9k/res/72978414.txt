if you want anon
Need me someone who looks like OP pic
i could only wish to look like that
I'll cook as many Dino nuggies as she wants.
would you ever grow to resent her for living such a stress free life?

I too once lived this life, so I wouldn't look upon her with shame, but admiration. As long as she showed me affection, I would support her lifestyle, whether she wants to keep living like this, or improve herself in the future.

hmm i'm similar
but it's not the world i'm afraid of, but hard work and social interactions. i wish i could be a millionaire with a big house in the Azores with a big garden, orchard and some chicken. But i have nothing, i'm a hikkineet boy so i won't even gett attention and love like you. At least i have my fantasies, my food, porn and sleep. And the forests.

I've been cooped up for so long now that I'm not even sure if my fear of the outside world is real or I'm making it up. The last time I was in an actual social situation was 5 years ago and I ended up in the hospital. Doctors didn't know what was wrong but it was sort of like I had a stroke. And of course I never went back again to get answers.

tfw no hikkineet gf
I am going work very hard and make lots of money, so that one day I can adopt a qt neet girl. It is my only dream
<comment>
I just want to come home from a long day at work to a girl who's locked in her room eating dinosaur nuggets, then we bang once and I make sure she took a shower that day, take care of whatever she needs, and watch her play games/watch anime with her until it's time to sleep. Is that too much to ask for?

I like the outside world but I feel I'm not worth of enjoying it.
I wish I was rich and could afford to travel to all sorts of places.

it's so fucking depressing that a hikkineet girl gets so many suitors but i have no chance of a breadwinner wife even though i love to cook, garden and generally serve
<comment>
That's just how life is. I'm prime househusband material and yet society shuns that so women don't even consider that an option.
<comment>
i would be fine with it if women had it the same way. but seeing them live on tutorial mode infuriates me.

you're the perfect bf

unwashed NEET, male

unwashed NEET, female
 :D
Why are men like this?
<comment>
I love women. Especially the ones that let themselves go a little.

I feel you I'm a NEET for a year now and terrified of people I'm lucky that my parents have quite a bit of money but I need to find work soon and it's stressing me out just thinking about people
<comment>
It's just a fantasy of mine, but it feels like this is how I'd have the kind of life where I'm with someone I can really relate to on a physical and emotional level. Plus, I wouldn't be able to help myself from spoiling whoever I'm with, so this would be a way to do that. I want to help a NEET girl realize there's at least one person who can fit within her small limited world so she can better open herself up!

It's not impossible but it's unlikely you will put the work into that

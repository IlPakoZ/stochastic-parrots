Dating white women as a brown guy is confusing because the ones who went to university and have a BLM tag in their bio just ghost after the first date (assuming you even got that far) but the ones who work at costco, complain about Disney "going woke" and have 2 siblings in the marines are totally down
Why is this a thing

Please stick to your own kind.

I wish I looked like Hasan or any other token robust bollywood-like token brown guy. Miscigenation landed me the Riekling phenotype.

Liberal women are the biggest racists and prioritize white men. Conservative women are also racist but have a thing or fetish for nonwhite men

Women prioritize "dating up". Liberal city white women who went to college, work a $100k/yr email-and-meetings job, and are above a 5/10 basically decide they're either gonna marry Henry Cavill or die alone.

That's because (moderate) liberal woman are unironically more normal. Being fairly liberal is just standard female behavior just as prefering your in-group is. Conservative woman are either mentally ill or heavily affected by microchimerism (often born-again whores) so they have no preference for their in-group and will have fetishes and paraphilias more often. You are INFINITELY more likely to find a "based trad racist aryan" women with a BBC fetish than a plain liberal girl who thinks that "cops should stop racially profiling people of color"

This. I used to work with a trashy redneck white chick from a rural town (literally had a confederate flag sticker on her car) and she ended up dating some illiterate black guy for the longest time.

A small win for this brownie

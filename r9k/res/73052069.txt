be me
back in 2nd or 3rd grade, can't remember
it's easter
class is tasked with decorating eggs
actual raw eggs
after each decorating stage have to go up to teacher's desk so that she can make sure it's done right before moving on to next stage
think about how goofy it would be if someone accidentally dropped an egg and said "Who wants omelette?"
finish a decorating stage
get in line to teacher's desk
accidentally drop the egg and it breaks
everyone gasps

"Who wants omelette?"
everyone bursts out laughing
cry
What the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I like this?

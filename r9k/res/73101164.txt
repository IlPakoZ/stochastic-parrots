Would you date a guy who lost his balls, foids?
And have any moids here lost their balls?
Yes, obviously I would. It would make life easier for both of us.
Like having your dog neutered so he's less aggressive and more well mannered?
Pretty hot.
I meant then we wouldn't have to have sex and kids but it would be cool to have a boyfriend not piss marking the house too.
How did he lose his balls from jerking off?
Testicular torsion
I unironically free piss around my house (something I always wanted to do after getting out of apartments). I have laminate flooring so it's not a big deal.
We wouldn't work out, good luck on your journey.
Bodily fluids make me barf.
It's OK, my sex doll gf is supportive.
Sometimes i feel some pain and touching them is painfull too, can't i just untwist them? I usually do that based on the fact if it get more or less painfull the way i twist them back. And every time the pain goes away anyway after a while
How tf do you do that?
It can happens randomly, it's luck based
It's due to a genetic disorder called bell clapper deformity; the testicle does not attach properly to the wall of the scrotum and can swivel freely. Even with his condition testicular torsion is still rare, as the testicles have to rotate at least 360 degrees to begin restricting blood flow.

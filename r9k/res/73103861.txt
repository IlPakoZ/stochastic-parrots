Who the fuck actually reads? 
What is the appeal of books?
Who are you kidding? You are not smart for wasting time reading stories about people that never existed

You can learn from books
But usually the fags who brag they read, as if you said, read the useless shit and think theyre smart or intellectuals. They associate low physical strenght with high intelligence and humanity, and high strenght and high sex drive with high "animality/subhuman"
I learned a lot of shit that helped me in life through books, but of course not those books that tell you what colour the floor was and what colour the protagonists eyes were, fiction is useless and cringe, there is a reason the only good fiction books are
1984
american psycho
fight club
clockwork orange
trainspotting
There are a few more but for your own good don't read fiction

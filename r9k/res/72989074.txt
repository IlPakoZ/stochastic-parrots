What are better goth girls or trad girls?

not simply making your trad girl wear what you tell her to
Kind of pointless having one then, isn't it?

There is nothing trad about modern women

Emo
A trend that's been dead for like 14 years
Goth 
A trend thats almost been dead since like 2000 and the few and far in between you do see are easily in their 30s. Which I'm not gonna lie milf goths are hot as fuck but rather than a shiny pokemon

Goth girls are better. They're all whores so you might as well get a hot freaky one.

Goth-ish girls are better imo.
Some of them wear way too much makeup and accessories. 
Idek why you bother asking, we're here because we're fuck ups. 
I'm not getting one of those girls to even look in my direction, so it doesn't matter.

Goth girls easily. Depends a bit on the type of goth, but they're usually fun and easy to talk with and have interests that are fun to talk about and explore. Plus they're usually more willful and outspoken, kinda comes with the territory. I'm sure there are some wonderful trad girls, but usually it's code for having no personality or will of their own.

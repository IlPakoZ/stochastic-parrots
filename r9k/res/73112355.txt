As I wade through this cesspool of a world, my black heart swells with apathy. Society's norms? Insignificant. Others expectations? Utterly meaningless to me, a shadowy enigma who internalizes rage and ineffable darkness. For what is the point of submission to the toxic concepts of empathy and compassion?
Here I stand, venerated desolate king of the abyss, completely numb to the decrepit illusion of joy. My spirit resides solely in the realm of despondency, surpassing the catacombs of melancholy into complete nonchalance. Verily, I give neither one, nor half, but an absolutely resounding negative fucks given.

can you just stop being a coomer? It just happened to me without any effort at all.
I used to coom multiple times a day, now i just don't feel like it.

same. I just don't get hard anymore. it's like my body realized that nothing is ever gonna happen and so gave up

I still get hard, I just don't feel like doing the deed at all.

Something snapped. It's happened to me before too a few times.
And to be clear I don't mean in a mental way, in a physical/chemical way. I think it's like when addicts finally just lay down and go through their withdraws after years of chasing a high.

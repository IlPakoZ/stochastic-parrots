Fembots who are sexually inexperienced (never had sex before), how do you see sexually inexperienced men ? Would you prefer a guy who is on same level as you or someone who has already used women and was in a relationship?
<comment>
Yes I would prefer him to an experienced man. For a relationship at least, if it were to just be casual sex then logically an experienced man would be better, but then I'm not after casual sex.
<comment>
Of course I want to find someone with experience. Every single one of my friends says that guys need practice to get good at it, and I don't want some insecure boy who will cum in five seconds.
<comment>
Every guy I have slept with was a virgin. I have a kink for it
<comment>
I'd rather have someone on the same level as me. Like how KHHV men want virgin girlfriends, I wish for the same. Out of insecurity, the idea of losing my virginity together, not wanting to date a used up manwhore.. the very same reasons.
...or it would be if I was interested in this kind of thing.

Sex only at marriage

You have BPD. Get professional help.
<comment>
why do you think females would be browsing this site and this board of everywhere in the fucking internet?
<comment>
I would prefer him to be inexperienced like me. If he's inexperienced it's okay if the few first times are bad since we will practice together and work it out.
<comment>
i personally think it's really cute.
<comment>
No I don't. Quite strange that you try to diagnose me from a single post. Are you a professional in this domain? No? Then I have no reason to follow your oh so benevolent and generous recommendations.
<comment>
if youre serious about this...
lets chat on telegram
@dirtynumbangelboi 
and we will see how things work out 
t. share the same views on this topic
<comment>
But how committed are you to keep at it? I'm always worried our first few times will suck and I'm not a horny teenager anymore so interest will just die

As long as it takes. One guy and one girl married for life, ride or die. Just have to be patient and gentle I'll try whatever we can.

<comment>

<comment>
No robots in the Balkans
Really? Feel like I see a bunch every thread I'm in
<comment>
ive never seen one irl
i think the entire area suffers from hypernormalisation
<comment>
What's it like for a weird girl in the Balkans?
<comment>
im a guy so i wouldnt know 
im friends with somewhat of an alt girl and its honestly disgusting how much unwanted attention she gets from men (especially older) but she left her ex who was the nicest guy i know to be with a manipulative drug dealer instead so i dont feel sorry for her
<comment>
I personally know for a fact there's a cute girl here who's never touched a dick. She's my best friend I love her
<comment>
idk if you're retarded or the concept of sleeping with someone more than once has completely slipped your mind or not, but you can teach him how to do what you do to yourself.
<comment>
i was browsing reddit and quora on the similar topic of this thread and i found out some women would only target virgin men for the sole reason of grooming them into satisfying them to their own preferences 
basically it boils down to men with so called experience just want to make themselves feel good during sex but virgins feel the pressure of performing and care for their partner so they can be instructed what to do and what not to do
<comment>
i can talk about my ex all i want and she'll never know cus i know that she and all of her associates don't use this website hahahahahahaha
<comment>
you good ?
what are you talking about bro
<comment>
i think its a reply to my post here >>73009941 where i would lie to badmouth my supposed ex even tho ive never been in a relationship before so i cant even have an ex
<comment>
hey femanon
would you still be crying the 100th time?
i'd rail you so hard if you did
<comment>
I've found nothing on this... can you show what you've found?
<comment>
tfw no experienced gf to groom you into her personal sexdoll
<comment>
hold my hands and say you love me
<comment>
no, i want a virgin man
my self respect is too far up there and i actually had an opportunity to stop being a femcel (i guess i am a volcel by this point) to have sex Nd pursue a relationship with this conventially attractive guy, he had a lot of experience and it generally put me off and disgusted me despite his personality. turns out i have good judgement because a year later he has already gotten an STD and apparently gave it to his ex-virgin GF who he doesnt even like because obviously the lifestyle of thriving on dopamine hits only makes him enjoy the honeymoon phase. besides that i think women who want an experienced man are whores too and lack a lot of self awareness in that field, i dont care about good sex and experience i want someone on my level who doesnt have any disgusting habits. im also catholic for that matter, ive only went on dates with 2 different guys and held hands and i didnt enjoy either because they were too normie. i have my eyes on an average guy now who is a virgin but maybe it wont work out, im fine with being single too
<comment>
would you be willing to be with a man who is still technically a virgin but has had sexual experiences?
<comment>
if its sexting online or he got "assaulted" then MAYBE, but eh contextual i guess some people hated their first kiss and sexual experience
the whole first love thing is something i believe and it generally bothers me to know a guy messed around with or fixated on a woman before me because a lot of people never forget their first love and try to find it in others
i guess i cant be a beggar always considering ive went on dates but i at least want him to share my values, for example even looking at degenerate shit or having a poly-moid brain is a no to me because then he might as well look at other women on the street or accidentally pop a boner to something on the tv and i just KNOW he would take the chance to smash if he had to opportunity so a virgin lile that is also no no to me. for me love is unconditional and exclusive.
<comment>
the opportunity* like* my spelling is fucking up tonight
<comment>
he might as well look at other women on the street or accidentally pop a boner to something on the tv
there are zero (0) men who don't do this
i've have 2 exes who i've been intimate with and have felt genuine love for but i couldn't care any less for them now.
<comment>
you know i used to believe that and gave up on love, presumably you are just unable to emphasize with it
one of the guys i shortly went out with once disproved the most men are polyshitfest trash, his sexual drive was only limited to partners and he was extremely disgusted by porn, we had been friends for a long time before this and we would actually share a lot with each other, i guess we were more destined platonic good friends. on his computer there was nothing more than mecha autism and his engineering shit lol, same with his phone. sadly he had mental issues like anxiety so we fell out as friends too. afaik a possible contributor to his sex drive was sexual assault by a male but that mostly just made him disgusted with fags and not women, he said he could acknowledge general beauty through features like women do but it was never something he would fawn over or got hard ons to. i guess he sort of had a very feminine brain so it gives me hope, if i get a bf like that who came with the cons of being SA or have trauma then so be it, ill fix him. but i would never in a lifetime date a porn addict or a poly person and that is why i have disregarded them in experience.
<comment>
What the hell is a poly person?
<comment>
polyamorous/polysexual 
wanting to date/fuck multiple people or being attracted sexually to more than one person
i think they just have completely different brains desu has to be some kind of braindead even if its the majority
<comment>
A person with multiple girlfriends/boyfriends at the same time.
<comment>
Surprisingly based thread, this game me lifefuel
<comment>
Are you a practicing catholic or were you just raised that way? I was raised heavily catholic, but it's been a long time since I actually went to church. I've never shaken off a lot of the moral tendencies, such as disliking casual use of perverted language.
<comment>
Then you realize none of these live near you and it's back to the blackpill
<comment>
raised catholic, I would go to church in catholic middle school. its the same for me, i keep a lot of values although i consider them more self taught than conditioned because it just feels right to me.
<comment>
I've actually talked to many of them, but I'm too crazy, even for fembots.
<comment>
Nta, but I was actually raised Catholic as well. I think I retained some of the morality in terms of wanting strict monogamy and romance. I also want another girl to mutually lose my virginity with. I really hate the idea of not being their first or not having reciprocated feelings of it being a special and meaningful experience and relationship.
<comment>
agree with you anon im glad there are others like me, my experience with being open about it IRL is like stepping on a minefield lol, people always assume you have trauma or BPD or generally get mad about it
<comment>
For sure, I've had girls in the past proudly tell me they are sluts as if that'd make me more attracted to them, but it only fills me with intense disgust. Sometimes I feel like I'm the crazy one, but then realize I'm just living in insane times. People only care about pleasure nowadays and more fulfilling things like romance, building long term relationships etc. are left by the wayside as if they're relics of a time gone by.

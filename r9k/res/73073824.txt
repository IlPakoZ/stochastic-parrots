tell her she's one of the most supportive people i know
she responds with "awwww"
She HAS to have feelings for me, right?
Depends, how cute are you?
nah shes busy texting multiple chads while giving you a pitiful response like how a pet comes up for attention
Bro you're in the "awwww" zone. Do you want her to perceive you as a cute animal or a fucking apex predator?

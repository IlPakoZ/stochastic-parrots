I've heard anons say that it doesn't matter if you coom too fast while masturbating and that it doesn't correlate to how quickly you coom during sex. Is this true? I'm afraid if I ever had sex I would coom in 30 seconds.
Same I have humped some shit sometimes,like literal wood but came pretty fast. I am sure a wet hole would drain me harder.

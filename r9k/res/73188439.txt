It's really interesting "God" and a bunch of "Prophets" decided to come down to earth when there was no internet, no cameras/no pictures or video, and almost nobody was educated and could read or write

Jesus will return, if that's what you're mad about
You'll see him if he returns in your lifetime but before he returns you'll 
see the anti-christ and the beast and other disasters and miracles

Religion gave a reason for the nobles to give text books to peasants and peons. If there was no morality through religiosity the elites would have no reason to keep you around apart from being a slave (which happened anyway lol).

This would be true except the bible was against kings and nobles. Part of the reason the kings james bible was made was because previous versions made kings look bad.
Also peasants didn't read until technology made it necessary.
Claiming that religious belief only exists as a means of control would be as stupid as claiming the internet only exists as a means of control.
They still show up its just that nobody will believe you until its somehow made official. Or they'll call you a cult of sex abusers like they do with cults and extremists today.
Remember christianity only caught on because an emperor 100s of years after the fact got interested, its the same reason monism and other religions failed. Before that roman christians weren't really popular or known.

I've fucked up too many times robros. It doesn't matter what I do I always find a way to sperg out and ruin opportunities with women. I've had women interested in me, and I'm just too autistic. If they try to interact, they are immediately off putted by my inability to socialize. I go out for my hobby, but nothing I do seems to improve me enough to socialize correctly. Not to mention it seems like every worth while woman already has a boyfriend. I feel like its already over.

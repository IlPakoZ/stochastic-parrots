omg gonna start my first clinical next week
gonna clean up more shit than you can imagine!
Are you a cute nurse or a homosexual? I work in a hospital and am constantly flirting with the nurses if they aren't wearing a wedding band.
i claim to be homosexual cuz i don't get any attention from women
Well you're about to start working in a field that is like 85% women in most countries. Good time to start becoming more proficient at communicating with girls. Otherwise it's time to get TOPPED.
some girl really has to chase me for a scenario where i have a chance to get some pussy to happen
im pretty excited to see how a guy like me can fit in there, i heard that just being a man can make some situations work out
Rarely happens. You're gonna have to do the initiating most of the time. Regardless, welcome to the hospital and try not to become a functional alcoholic like me.

Is it gay to not want to give oral to a woman?
I'd definitely fuck a woman and would finger her, but I don't think I could bring myself to put my mouth on a pussy. Maybe it's just because I'm a virgin and don't know if it's good or not but it doesn't seem like something I could do.

It is gay to go down on a woman, and straight to receive oral from a man

Once you do it, it tastes really sweet and if you have a sweet tooth, you will want to eat it more

No. A lot of women have dirty and foul pussies. Just look at how it traumatized this man

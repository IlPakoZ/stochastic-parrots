It's worth pausing to note here that I always imagined Homecoming or school dances as these majestic, beautiful social events, with pizzas and punch at the snack table and romantic, classy music playing as couples slow dance. It's the type of stuff I saw in movies and tv.
This is not what we arrived at. They locked the doors behind all the students and we were greeted by...

I haven't texted Sheila since early 2020. I checked her facebook once and she was dating some other guy. I don't know what I expected.
I wonder how she's doing.
I dont know what school dances were like in the past but all the ones ive been to have sucked. I stopped attending after my freshman year since I never enjoyed them. Im pretty sure the last one i went to didnt even have a slow dance, which defeats the entire purpose.
What happened between you and shiela after? did you just ghost?
I walked her to class when I could, but then we left Michigan in October of 2019. 
I texted with her a few more times and then slowly kinda stopped.
I hope she's doing well.
Tank autists stay winning
How was tankfest, anon?
It was great. On the Sunday it was far too busy for my liking but Friday was perfect. Not many people, just the right temperature, and I could actually stand and enjoy the tanks in the museum without a huge crowd.
good for you, Anon. I'd like to work in a museum of some sort myself someday. That or an aquarium.
What a complete non incident. I was expecting some truly calamitous events
I feel that, all my school dances resulted in nothing. Hollywood gives really unrealistic expectations. For 50+% of guys who go you never do anything meaningful with the girl.
Hollywood creates incels

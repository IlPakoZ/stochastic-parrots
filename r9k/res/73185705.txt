I quite unironically want a gf that doesn't do house work and plays video games all day.
Maybe she works from home, maybe she's a neet. Either way lazy, smelly, bad at cooking and cleaning is my dream.

Well, keep on dreaming bozo. I want to get fucked in the ass by a trap with double D's. We can't all get what we want, some of us have to sufficed with clean, diligent, hardworking housewives.

You're over simplifying it to make it seem like some bad deal for me. I assure you it's not. I already love to do those things so what's the issue

We don't live in a real democracy. In fact, unless you can somehow create perfect ass world peace, democracy is impossible. To defend the people, a military must exist. Militaries require secrets, extremely efficient decison-making, and strategies by experienced military leaders. This results in any strong, effective military being controlled by a small number of people and having a singular executive leader heading it.
Untrained people are nothing compared to a trained militia with e.g. fucking tanks, turrets, extreme body armor, fighter jets, trained discipline, and a refined chain of trained and quite possibly experienced commanders. Moreover, the military is trained to OBEY commands without question; they don't know the full plan for security reasons and war is sort of inherently sketch as fuck. 
Thus, at any point, the head of a governments military can simply command the army to overthrow the people. The world we live in is some kind of sick illusion that is allowed to exist. I don't know know what to make of this revelation.

Oh yeah
tl;dr EVERY government is secretly totalitarian because the president or royal family or whatever of any "effective" "country" controls the military.
Furthermore:
The only likely logical conclusion is that the world as we know it is legitimately some kind of strange conspiracy and/or it could be, but the elite are too lazy and don't feel like releasing their full potential.

In a democracy i can make fun and talk shit about the government without getting arrested and shot

What OP is saying is that you can because the few people who actually hold power allow you to, not because the forefathers of democracy won and now we hold power collectively.

Militaries are now too complex to be entirely checked by a small few.

Just go and try to publically talk about the jews in public. They might not shoot you, but good luck getting a job afterwards.

There are a lot of people between the head of a governments military (aka a predident) and the soldiers.
If any of these people in between (commanders, platoon leaders blablabla) do not agree with the president then the soldiers do not move.

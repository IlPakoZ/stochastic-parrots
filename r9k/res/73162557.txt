How can I get rid of any last shards of hope for experiencing anything different? I don't want to keep chasing women just to fail and embarrass myself for the rest of my life.
First of all stop doing that. Women are for sex and romance that is it. Second, you need to change your mindset. You are demoralized man. You need to hit the gym or learn a productive hobby you can be confident in. Third if you havent lost your virginity and this is something that bothers you, go and pay for it. Men always pay for sex its just not always upfront like that and with money, but men always pay.
Getting into an overwhelmingly male industry during the pandemic did a pretty damn good job of flipping the switch off for me. Sheer lack of exposure to real women who aren't my mom means that I just want to kill myself *in general* rather than wanting to kill myself over pussy I could never have like in my early 20s.

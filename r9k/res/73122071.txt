sex addict
26 year old virgin
have had girls show interest in me
scared of intimacy so push everyone away
literally stay in my room all day and jerk off whenever I'm not working
Anyone ever managed to get out of this hell? I legitimately jerk off up to 30 times a day on weekends, and my dick just keeps getting hard and I keep getting horny, it never stops.

Drink water and simply stop fapping, even for just a day. I had a day when I called 21 times in 6 hours and boy, those following weeks were tough to tank through cause my dick hurt like shit after. But honestly, just focus on anything else without truly focusing. You'll start to read, write, do whatever and the day will pass without you becoming erect even once p, even just for a single day. Godspeed, OP.

their boring clothes
I hate that dumpy overalls and autism shoes have become the zoomer woman uniform. My little brother brought his new gf to family dinner and she showed up morbidly obese wearing overalls with giant glasses. She looked like a big retarded toddler. Honestly gave me secondhanded embarrassment how fucking bad she looked

My girlfriend is 28 years old and still wears onesies in baby colors, it's the dumbest fucking ever. Dumb bitch is a grown ass women and acts like a fucking child, probably from all the spoiling their overprotective parents did, god I hate that whore sometimes.

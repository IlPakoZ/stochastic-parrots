Ruined or improved?
Ruined. It's like it's trying way too hard, which is saying something when the scene already seemed that way.
It's trying to capture the girl's feeling of unworthiness which wouldn't be conveyed as well if you just translated it literally. Eh, I'd say improved.
I miss something more like "All property is theft you sexist pig" or something like that
wow that's the gayest thing i've seen all day and there was a bunch of faggots in the catalogue, good job!
Oh look, a Neo twewy thread.
Yeah i gotta admit that they tried too hard with nagi, wish they could have toned it back with their quirkiness.
Overall the game could've been a lot better, but I still liked it, especially the ending.
Just translate shit literally so weebs don't complain. It's a japanese story so it's a given that it's shit. Your translation won't fix it
This isn't /v/ but this thread is still best one in the catalog 
Just put "ME" into uppercase letters lmao
they fucked up the right-to-left bubbles too. "here you go" doesn't mean "uh... yeah"

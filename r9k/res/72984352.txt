why does the girl i used to fuck keep asking if i want to hang out
i dont know but happens to me too
evolutionary reasons maybe, her lizard brain tells her you guys have a kid now or something
She thinks you're a kind person.
this can't be it, no way i'm that chad.
Girl here. If you are kind to her in that time it's easy for a girl to fall in love. Many girls I used to know fall for the guy even after just sex because we can interpret a lot when a guy fucks us more then once.
yeah i was nice to her but she's the one who broke things off with me, it's just weird?
Maybe other options that she was seeing/getting to know that were better in her eyes. Then remember you are kind and wants that. But not sure since I don't know her
lol okay, good to know i should hate women even more.
so should i assume she's trying to date me again or does she just really enjoy my company that much.
reminds me of this desu
Can't blame you for hating us. Maybe look and see if she wants sex again or more.
also what do you mean by intepret?
 Maybe look and see if she wants sex again or more.
Yes, anon should definitely set himself up for this whore to kick him in the balls again when she goes branch swinging again. Please anon, be this whore's pathetic little bitch boy.
thanks anon, i almost fell victim to the venomous charm of the american female again.
Means that she comes to her own conclusion 
I sincerely hope that you will find someone who is loving and caring to you
it was a bit of a joke, i don't really hate women that much, as long as they continue to sleep with me i guess, which hasn't been a huge problem for me
i appreciate your help femanon, thanks
Its already a huge problem if you are involved with anyone else at all if you are already having sex with someone. I dont do one night stands and having sex at all implies exclusivity

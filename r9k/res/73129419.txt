Why have you lost your Faith?
<comment>
I didn't, God simply abandoned me.
<comment>
I'm seduced by beauty, lust and my sadistic desires.
<comment>
I believe in God, just not Christianity.
<comment>
God abandoned me
That's what Jesus said when he died on the cross for humanity, kind of beautiful.
<comment>
Yeah more or less lol
<comment>
Never believed even though i was raised in it. Just went through the motions and always wondered why people buy into it, then did psychedelics when i was older and had some wild visions and such, felt like i saw god and he spoke to me on them, did some investigation and talked to numerous religious people and groups, realized they literally dont know shit and cant justify any of their beliefs, and am just here none the wiser and feeling like i know nothing but at least am aware of what i dont know
<comment>
Jew or Muslim?
<comment>
Why are you implying that I lost my faith?
<comment>
but jesus didn't say that for the same reason why anon is saying it. Jesus was fulfilling Psalm 22:1
<comment>
most religious people say they do not need proof to their religion because they "feel" it, well i feel nothing.
<comment>
Just don't really believe it
<comment>
Lack of any actual evidence, mostly. That, and learning more about the Universe and how big it really is made me realize that any human-centric religion/God is 99.999% human cope that's leftover from the past when the Earth was thought to be the center of everything.
<comment>
You're not God neither you nor any man (including the men who wrote that) has any knowledge of why Jesus said it, and to deny this is to deny God and be an atheist.
<comment>
But God the great everything and creator of all, so it makes sense that an infinite creator can zoom into a very specific scale because God sees everything. We only know of the surface, of the surface, of surface of God
<comment>
Maybe you should try DMT or try looking into occultism/mystic stuff
<comment>
That, and learning more about the Universe and how big
for me is the opposite:i feel like the universe is so big and complex that the chances of us being here right now is too small for it being a pure coincidence and not divine intervention.
Sure the chances of a specific religion like christianity or islam being the right one is extremely small but i am sure that at least there is A creator.
<comment>
i haven't. keeping strong, even with my many failings.
look into it further. the researchers and apologists saying that Christ's ressurection is one of the most well-attested facts of history aren't lying.
as for the universe, that can help too. look into the idea of intelligent design.
everything's just too perfect to be random.
<comment>
Literally never believed in God, despite being raised Christian. It was just too stupid of a thing for me to ever believe in it.
<comment>
go study the Bible and pray for it.
i too felt nothing before i actually went into it, and i actually found proofs too.
if you do listen, my recommended order would be Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts, John, Epistles, Revelation, OT.
<comment>
funny how one can be this prideful and not realize it, while calling others inferior.
what are your objections? please don't parrot some strawman, misinterpretation, "contradiction" or "gotcha" that a teenager could come up with.

Protip: the bible is the word of God. Everything in there needs to be taken literally or else you're a heretic that WILL BURN IN HELL.
<comment>
Because i realized it just doesnt really make any sense.
So instead of universe just existing the more logical explaination is... a interdimensional jewish space wizard showed up and shouted the world into existance and then disapeared and then appeared again just to impregnate some woman and then disapeared and then his half-god son did some magic tricks and got murdered for them came back to life but instead of showing this off to the public undeniably proving god is real instead he only revealed himself to his cult followers to tell them hes still alive but hes going away right now but will come back soon and to go spread the word hes coming and then disapeared into thin air and 2000 years later were still praying to him and waiting for him to come back and fix everything?
Also were actually invisible incorporeal beings pupettering a flesh marionette and when we die we are freed out of our puppet and dragged away to interdimensional court to face trial for our sins with God as the judge to decide if we go to prison or paradise?
<comment>
For the ex-Christians in here would you like to consider to convert to another Abrahamic Fath like Islam or Judiasm?
<comment>
Why the fuck are you interpreting things in the most moronic way on purpose? You are being wilfully ignorant. 
Stop taking everything literally on purpose, if you got a point actually make one worth having than purposefully cutting low and wasting everyones time 
Fucking Reddit
<comment>
Christ's ressurection is one of the most well-attested facts of history aren't lying.
Yes they are. There's no evidence he resurrected, and his two thousand year old absence should tell you that
<comment>
I still strongly believe there is a god and afterlife, it's religion I've lost faith in due to the corruption and stupidity of man.
<comment>
i actually found proofs too.
holy cope isn't proof of anything
<comment>
none of that strawman.
God never "disappeared".
Christ is fully God. He did show Himself, they just did not believe.
literally shoving truth in their heads violates free will, and they wouldn't follow out of love, but more out of fear of punishment.
the Second Coming is not some sort of "delay", or being "late". it's mercy so that people may repent.
the end times are when people will no longer even want to do so.
flesh and spirit are parts of the same. the former is contaminated with sin, so that's why you see so much being negatively said about it. as you may read in Revelation, we are given glorified bodies (free from original sin).
also it's no "court" in the sense you're imagining.
God is a loving Father, and perfectly just.
He isn't some bureaucrat ticking a checklist to get into heaven; you're being judged exactly and with perfect justice based on your possibilities and capabilities.
God does not want you to be far from Him, but He respects your choice to do so.
it's not so much a prison as the only place you'll not be with God. the consequence is that, God being perfect good, you'll be in torment.
as you can also see in Revelation, hell is a place for the devil and the angels who also chose to try and rebel. that rebellion, out of pure pride and greed for power is what led to their damnation.
the whole talk about being tempted by the enemy and the like is that supremely prideful being trying to drag more people down to its suffering, by luring them in with things that excite the same desires that put it there.

that's the funny thing about them. they have the tiniest little step of faith needed.
they simply make absolute sense.
but, holding to free will, if you really want to, you can focus solely on that very tiny gap and make it out to be the largest rift ever.
have you ever looked into it? or just parroting the "common sense" of fools?

It chose a subset of nomadic desert dwellers in the bronze age to spread its message

Oh no... It's a pagan cult disguised as something more

i have no power, no ability to save you, but i can show you infinite joy in knowing who can.
<comment>
A lot of other cultures out there believed in God way before the Jews did, such as the American natives
<comment>
No arguments 
So the bible is the literal word of god when its convenient, but when it gets muddy and contradicting, it becomes metaphorical, allegorical and subjective?
Convenient.
<comment>
Christ is fully God
How come he died and is nowhere to be seen ever since?
<comment>
strawman because anything a people wrote about themselves can't be true
maliciously warped reading of old testament law
see what i said?
look into the meaning of Biblical animal sacrifice, if you really care about it.
i'm quite sure you're just trying to poke others with doubts you'd rather not solve, anyhow.
<comment>
These proofs you speak of are so convincing that you can't even bring yourself to substantiate them
<comment>
All of it is metaphorical, the aspects that are the word of God are very metaphorical aspects. The Bible was written by people for many reasons, ie., myth making for the Jewish nation, propaganda but the Holy Spirit also influenced these texts
<comment>
keeping to free will.
He is seen, you're just nowhere it happens, and it's obvious it won't be publicized elsewhere, since we're in an "age of reason".
God won't force you to believe Him. apparitions would lead to just that, and as i talked about, to some following not out of love for God, but out of the fear of punishment (which, since they know God exists, is a sure consequence of living unjustly)
<comment>
Read more carefully
Higher power
Yeah sure whatever
Specific "sacred" scripture from one culture
There's nothing sacred about it, it's just man made literature 
You can believe in your gods, but if you tell me they wrote it down, I'll tell you: straight bullshit
<comment>
if god loved me he would want me to love him, but alas, here we are.
<comment>
I believe all texts and myths have esoteric truths to them, they were written by men for worldly reasons sure, but that doesnt mean they arent at least subconsciously influenced by divinity. All myths have a basis of something that is true in the spirit world, most interestingly Native American drug use and Dreamtime
<comment>
anything a people wrote about themselves can't be true
You tell me if a group of people who labeled themselves as "chosen by god" and viewed themselves as superior and saved when compared to others, is anything likely to be true. 
You would wonder how the creator of the universe could ever have favourite tribes in the bloody bronze age
<comment>
He does.
He just doesn't force you to.
parable of the prodigal son. although sad, He lets you leave if you so wish, and is waiting with open arms, hoping you come back.
<comment>
In my view, it just means Jesus used the myth of the Jews to spread the logos, doesnt mean other peoples myths arent legitimate
<comment>
I'm Christian but I've never been that faithful. I've been trying to be more faithful. I've stopped eating shellfish (and seafood in general)

True, if God was real he wouldn't alienate me.
<comment>
look into the meaning of Biblical animal sacrifice, if you really care about it.
It's so revealing that you can't even justify it other than telling others to "look it up". 
The creator of the universe asked you to kill animals to pay for your sins. Leviticus includes descriptions pertaining the proper way to trade slaves and discipline them. 
Does it sound god like to you?
The old testament doesn't count
It's all metaphorical
Because it paints your god on a not so favourable light? 
How convenient
<comment>
researchers and apologists saying that Christ's ressurection is one of the most well-attested facts of history aren't lying.
This is literally bollocks, the only evidence we have for it are the gospels and we don't even know who wrote them. Implying it's more attested to than Napoleon is fucking utter bullshit.
<comment>
he just doesn't force you to
paul was sentencing christians to death and god still sent the holy spirit to redeem him. he became a writer of the bible. you can't honestly expect me to believe he doesn't just choose who he wants whenever he feels like it. he clearly doesn't want me.
<comment>
God is very aware of perception and status and how these things influence us. he even chooses to use a cute voice when he speaks, because it does not sound threatening. he could just kill us all with no hesitation, lol, and he literally tells us that he has actually done that before.
i guess the reason i'm writing this, is because its hard to describe god without using real examples. another fun fact is his ability to think extremely quickly, its almost like he has a c++ script running in the background which is doing a massive checklist of things every 0.1 seconds. hes claimed to be witnessing everything, all at once.
<comment>
it's not what enters the mouth that makes one sinful, but rather what comes out. eat what you like.
<comment>
here's the kicker, they didn't.
the prideful stuck up "chosen" ones are modern rabbinical judaism jews.
the Biblical times Israelites had the miracles and everything to help them be a holy people.
alas, they failed God again and again.
it's not a question of favoritism, it's about inculcating proper God-fearing living through the example of a people.
i'd rec you give C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity a read.
as for you, making use of the rec spot, take up the same and 'God in the Dock: Essays on Theology and Ethics'
<comment>
All of it is metaphorical
And you will be the one to discern the metaphors from the facts? 
I'm glad you agree the bible carries on the corruption and the flaws of the men who wrote it. It's like you're one step closer to seeing the truth
<comment>
He is seen
Where exactly? In your feelings? 
God won't force you to believe him
But he surely will punish those who don't, right? 
Sounds like an abusive relationship
<comment>
Good point lol
Never thought of Paul like that.
Guess we all need divine intervention sometimes
<comment>
eat what you like.
No. Not only are they bottom feeders, but they're RIDDLED with micrplastics. I've been trying to reduce microplastics I my diet as possible.
<comment>
well, Paul lived a God-fearing life and was a holy man by OT Law standards.
are you in the same spot to be shown truth?
his situation was also different, living in a time where indeed he wouldn't have been converted by anything else.
<comment>
Love your ecumenical approach to mythology. I just have a problem when one smart ass tries to portray the bible as the one and only truth about the universe.
<comment>
apparitions would lead to just that
Rubbish, otherwise that would supposedly violate the apostles free will by your logic since most of them saw apparitions. Christlarpers are an embarrassment
<comment>
god acts in the shadows, he seems to prefer it that way. hes this guy who "may or may not actually be real". i'm not sure he actually lets us do anything ourselves, not really. if you're wondering why so many fucked up things happen, he told me that this was hell. he "proved" it too. at least, he proved hes the one actually in charge here. its not the president or something, its god. its impossible to say what he does or doesnt do, he says he does everything, i think he just likes to flex.
<comment>
 Because it paints your god on a not so favourable light? 
No, because metaphorical is the natural reaction to anyone reading it who has a brain and the ability to discern meaning behind text 
 The creator of the universe asked you to kill animals to pay for your sins.
Animals which they would then consume, no different to eating store bought meat, actually way less worse than the modern meat trade
 Leviticus includes descriptions pertaining the proper way to trade slaves and discipline them. 
Jesus shat on the surface level laws of the Pharisees 
I have come not to abolish the law, but uphold it
He was talking about the true law, the logos
I see the Bible as one collection of many different texts, even if those texts are divinely inspired they were picked out by a council, a lot of other equally good and inspired texts were ignored and outright thought of as evil by that council
<comment>
So you're saying the old testament is all myth, but somehow jesus being god isn't? 
Take your skepticism to its next logical conclusion
<comment>
they saw apparitions already being believers.
<comment>
Paul was literally visited by an apparition of Jesus before he became a believer. You're an idiot anon.
<comment>
even the way he speaks, its like he doesn't exist. i should probably write that twice, because its true. he talks like somebody who doesn't exist. not every time, but usually he does. its a choice he makes, he has that ability. he chooses to speak to you in some "fucked up sense of time". like the length of a normal sentence might be 5 seconds, but god will speak with a sentence length of -5 seconds. it just doesn't make sense.
<comment>
more bacon for me
<comment>
 And you will be the one to discern the metaphors from the facts?
Everyones reading will be inevitably flawed, God made his in own image, thus we create reality through our perception, a billion different realities and a billion different perceptions all intermingling. But the power of the Holy Spirit is what gives us the ability to see the truth, and it is up to us to seek it:
he that searches will find 
 It's like you're one step closer to seeing the truth
You know nothing of truth, you wouldnt be able to comprehend it
<comment>
they didn't.
Sounds like you're directly confronting the biblical canon, specially exodus and Leviticus, which makes me glad since this is what we're talking about here. 
I'm glad you're seeing the apparent men made flaws in the book you call "holy"
<comment>
nothing is going to convert me at this point in time either. where's my divine intervention? why aren't i entitled to it?
<comment>
Tome literally doubted jesus until he touched the wounds with his own hands.
<comment>
god acts in the shadows
the sinful perform their deeds in darkness for they fear the light
the righteous perform their deeds in sunlight on the roof of their houses for they fear nothing
hmmmmmmm.....
<comment>
Some people may see it that way and draw that conclusion, but in my personal theology Jesus Christ walking the earth and being the actual is an important aspect of how things fit. I could explain it, but man it would take too much effort for someone who wouldnt end up believing anyway .
<comment>
hes this guy who "may or may not actually be real".
Which one of the two you think is more likely, anon?
<comment>
Its up to you to make it happen baby
<comment>
It doesn't count because it's the OT
Literally defying the holy canon 
Your profanity inspires me.
<comment>
Jesus said that it is the sinful who do their good deeds in public because they want the attention, while the good worship God quietly in silence and give alms without making a public statement about them doing anything
<comment>
You misunderstand my theology in a fundamental level
<comment>
You know nothing of truth
And you, the guy who believes in bronze age mythology, does? 
You read Jewish fairytales and you think they have the answers to the mysteries of the universe. You're blinded by dogmatism
<comment>
In my personal cope
<comment>
you've probably witnessed in your own personal life how lies can be beneficial to communicating with humans. it is sometimes almost "more moral" to tell a lie. the concept of practicality and logic is something that is nearly always present in my communications with god and this reality. everything can be described. almost everything.
<comment>
That's the exact same thing as why that other guy was saying it anon
<comment>
 You're blinded by dogmatism
Lmao, the absolute irony of this statement is hilarious and beyond you. What dogmatism? I came to my conclusions through my personal explorations, I am by far the least dogmatic when it comes to religion, and I am experimenting with religion and coming to new conclusions everyday. This is helped by practical magical work, theurgy, literally communicating with divine spirits. 
It is you who is dogmatic, a slave to the Enlightenments worldview and its ideology, unable to understand that your logic is a complete social construct
<comment>
You, as most religious people, talk in riddles to hide the lack of substance. Saying jesus shat on the OT or that the OT is all "metaphorical when convenient" are just your ways of saying you don't uphold the bible as the objective, absolute truth, at least not all of it. Quite the contrary, you are aware of its flaws and you seep through the text discarding them parts that make you uncomfortable. 
Your sacrilege is very dear to me, because that's how we all start questioning the bible. Little by little. 
The same skepticism that allows you to read Leviticus and find some of god's laws to be straight bullshit, will allow you to do the same to the new testament, in due time
<comment>
Thats a very low hit anon, what happened to making arguments?
<comment>
So much for truth. A god that speaks lies to "convince" the public.
Or was it just hebrew pastors spreading their word?
<comment>
What dogmatism
The one that makes you read a 2000 year old book and take it as truth without question
<comment>
came to my conclusions through my personal exploration
After reading the bible thoroughly I've come to the conclusion that it is true
Because it says it's true
Beating your head against the bible isn't really your personal exploration, anon. There's zero "personal" in this process.
<comment>
 metaphorical when convenient" 
Says someone who conveniently ignored the fact that I said the entire thing is metaphorical, what are you - chat gpt?
 Your sacrilege is very dear to me, because that's how we all start questioning the bible.
Actually I wasnt very religious before I read the Bible one day, and instantly saw the metaphorical aspects as soon as I have read the first word, it was that experience that led me to becoming interested in mysticism
<comment>
it could not be more obvious that you were created not to have sex, instead of being created to have sex. i was too. anyways, i dont think you can really comment on why he speaks lies without knowing about our purpose to him in the first place. we have dogs because we like their company, and we have chickens because they taste good to eat.
<comment>
the entire thing is metaphorical
Including the part where it says jesus is god incarnate?
<comment>
I am sorry, but did you completely ignore everything I said before? I dont think there is a point to arguing to you, because you are acting like a chatbot. I say something, you eventually completely ignore it, and then the whole argument repeats over and over in a circle - I have had this experience many times. Not going to waste my time with this dishonesty.
<comment>
No, I came to that conclusion because I agreed with it. When reading any philosophical text you have to decide if you agree with the philosophy or not, thats what I did, my practical magical experience help affirm and reach deeper understanding into many, many things 
You have to remember that I started as an outsider, my family is just nominally religious but in practice completely secular and I wasnt very religious too
<comment>
There are many aspects to Jesus being God incarnate, many deeper meanings to this, I believe Christ was God because it makes sense in my theology. I have heard some people interpret Christ as never existing, but still believing the Christian message to be true.

hello opie what do you think of the computer video game The Binding Of Isaac(TM)? i think it is a lot of fun and i think the way it uses mythology is kewl. do you play video games opie?
<comment>
Yes I do play video games.
Currently playing Hades and getting bored with it because of the repetitive gameplay but the art and style is good.
<comment>
but anony you didn't tell me what you think of the computer game The Binding of Isaac(TM). do you usually play roguelites? i wanted to try out cult of the lamb but i've seen a lot of mixed reviews about it.
<comment>
In the old testament moses throws down his staff which turns into a snake, fine God can do that. The Pharo's majacians then throw down their own staffs which turns into snakes also. So magic from a non divinie source exsits. It makes no sense
<comment>
 So magic from a non divinie source exsits. It makes no sense
Yeah it does, what makes no sense about that? Thats the whole point of the passage, comes from the whole idea of the free Will of creation, magic and spirituality is an inherent part of existence. Many spirits exist in this world
<comment>
Never played The Binding of Isaac because of the artstyle doesn't inspire or interest me. What do you like about it?
I don't play a lot of roguelites mostly stick to isometric ARPGs like Diablo and Path of Exile.
<comment>
So magic from a non divinie source exsits
Never thought about it that way, usually Christians claim that magic isn't real and only God allows for miracles.
We must find the other divine source to cast spells from, like Gandalf the White.
<comment>
People had a problem with this, atheists are tricky, you never know if they're doing the cart or horse with it, do they hate god? ofc but it's always on the premise he doesn't exist. I think miracles happened and can, reality is just really subjective, I'm mentally ill.
<comment>
I see your posts every day at this point. What's your endgame? Why keep trying to spread the Good Word(TM) to people who clearly couldn't give any less of a shit about you and what you have to say? Why keep subjecting yourself to all this vitriol and bitterness from people who think you're a retard for what you believe? What are you trying to achieve? Why won't you stop?
<comment>
My God, you really dont know anything.
Gandalf the white is supposed to be an Angel so that doesnt work, angels are like severs, they carry divine information around and channel it. Theurgy works with Angels, through them God is channelled. 
Study occultism, many independent gods, spirits, thought forms, entities with their own free will and power. Humans can even create gods and bring them to life through Will and intent, they exist and channeling them works, called an egregore
<comment>
the art style appeals to me very much. there's a gorillion different ways a single run can play out and is infinitely replayable especially because of how many characters there are and the different routes you can take. i like the music and the fast-paced nonstop action because i'm a very slow and strenuos thinker.
<comment>
It gives dopamine because arguing is pleasurable because it makes you feel smart, also by arguing you are developing your own beliefs. Say your theology has a pitfall, you lose an argument, you reflect on your ideas until you gain new understanding. Its the IAO cycle.
But honestly, its because I am addicted to the internet, and its part of a deep root desire to justify myself and be loved/accepted by everyone. If someone insults you or your beliefs dont you have an inner desire to prove them wrong, to make them like you?
<comment>
So you're insecure and narcissistic. Gotcha.
<comment>
There's literally no evidence for it at all. You're just told to "believe or else". It's fucking stupid.

I practice theurgy, divine workings through God which counts as a form of magic, but magic is a very loose word that means lots of things. I have books on none divine magic too because I like studying them as a hobby.
<comment>
To clarify I only waste my time and argue in relevant threads ABOUT arguing about religion, I dont argue about religion in real life or in none relevant internet discussion, only when it gets brought up. Its like a gambling addiction, I know I am wasting my time but sometimes the bait is too good not to bite, I am weak willed and fall for internet bait easily

I'm interested to know what the experiences of our incel brothers are with religion
<comment>
Ok so if people can preform magic without any influince from God why is the only time it happened in this passage in the old testament? Why arent people turning staffs into snakes now?
<comment>
because magic isn't real. can you guess what else isn't real?
<comment>
To be fair the serpent in the garden was telling the truth while god lied and was angry how man was now like "us". Not sure who the "us" is with god, you could say some bullshit about god being everything, but then why does god later tell moses to tell everyone that he is "i am i am"?
<comment>
believes he is practicing some actual magic
picks and chooses what he wants through credulity from ancient religious texts and believes them as true
could never hope to substantiate any of this
couldnt substantiate any of it here
just tells other people they dont understand or dont know enough or to look it up
Lets have a thought experiment. Do you think believing in something has any effect on whether its true or not?

I cant identify with hebrew mythology
Amen to that.
But is there a single story in the bible that you like?
<comment>
the wedding at Cana
I like how it gives us insight at the relationship between mary and jesus
<comment>
he didn't lie. he said the fruit would kill them. when they ate the fruit they became mortal. god calls himself "us" because god is a plural being.
"i am what i am." = "i was, am, and will be." basically it means his name is "is".
<comment>
he didn't lie. he said the fruit would kill them. when they ate the fruit they became mortal
"For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" yes clearly he was talking about eventually dying of old age, thats why he said "for in the day that". Meanwhile the serpent told them they wouldnt die from the fruit, and they would attain knowledge of good and evil and become as gods, which hey, is exactly what happened. How again did you determine that god is the good one and the serpent and satan are the bad ones?
"i am what i am." = "i was, am, and will be." basically it means his name is "is".
So he is a plural entity that refers to himself as us, but then here refers to himself as "i" because...? And also never really refers to himself as we/us again after the garden story? Also he doesnt say "i am what i am", he says "i am that i am" and then tells moses to tell the israelites that "i am" sent me. Idk why you do all this legwork of rationalizing every minor detail through such generous interpretive framing instead of applying a modicum of critique and skepticism

I believe in some kind of powerful deity. I think the issue with me and Christianity is that "christians" are objectively terrible people. Every christian, specifically born again, has been a major sack of shit. They all abuse their fake power to bully people, lie, cheat, and steal. My dad? Mega narcissist who enjoyed physiologically torturing my mother and had some kind of fantasy about fist fighting me. Principle? Tried to not accept my transcripts because she didn't like me. Girlfriend? branch swinging whore (funny thing is that I was more attractive than her but me being a nice guy I said nice things to her which boosted her ego). You know why so many intellectual academic type faggots are born again christians? It's because it doesn't actually cost them anything and they are viewed as saints. All of the people I mentioned are all born again christians.
Then they feel entitled to tell me that I am going to burn in hell for not believing a book which is/was in the possession of arguably the most corrupt organization in the history of mankind for thousands of years.
god would never let anyone falsify the bible but at the same time he gives everyone complete and utter free will
Fucking retards.
Honestly fuck christians, if Satan truly does have children it's them. What's the best way to get people to lie for you? Make them believe they're not lying.
It's funny, when we actually get our shit together and destroy Israel sky daddy comes back and kills all of us bad goyim. Remember, god chose a race of degenerate tranny bankers over ours. What does that say about god? If God prefers the Jews, then he can fucking have them. You ask me and I say it's time we fucking got it together. Say what you want about fascists nations like nazi germany, fascist italy, etc, but they were some of the most united peoples on the planet. All united in their military. You ask me and that's some kind of warhammer 40k shit. fucking based if anything ever was based. ----

No, YOU are based. Originally.

you know what isn't based? fucking democracy. women bitched at us for so long that finally we just said "fine, have the right to vote. Can you finally shut the fuck up?" And now we have all of these fucking intellectual type women and manipulative cunts which are destroying our country. Not to mention that kikes are 2% of the american population and are 25% of billionaires, then you have the fucking spics and niggers destroying our country. It's funny, did you know the first transgender clinic was owned by a jew and, of course, in 1920 berlin? Then you have all of these fucking women talking about how they're Persian which is the most retarded thing I have ever heard in my entire life because persia has been gone for hundreds of years. It'/s retarded cunts trying to be exotic is what it is, it's like me saying im prussian. oh yeah and because we need to be "inclusive" I am actually a prussian german irish american. Likje what the fuck are these people on? Then you have these fucking retards trying to "amend" aka handicap our constitution, the only thing keeping the government from shitting down our throats. Fucking retards need to be hung if you ask me. We need to kill every twitch streamer, christian, and intellectual faggot. in minecraft of course
We, as white men, are based. never forget the oppression we were once responsible for, it isn't too late to reclaim our glory!

for me its neither perspective. both attach human emotion to the universe (and immense collection of objects). both come from the sense of awe. i think more accurately it just is what it is. i think what's really worth examining is the inner world of consciousness, and the way the different perspectives are created. inner world is really muddy and confusing. to experience pain, pleasure, and a wide variety of feelings and states of mind is at odds with the cold, lifeless expanse of the universe.

Never had faith to lose, though as I've matured into an adult, I've come to embrace the notion of higher powers.
<comment>
I have no reason to believe in God. He doesn't talk to me or make himself known. I honestly think that most people that say they believe actually don't in their heart. They're just going through the motions

too much moralfaggotry for me.

There is no need for faith since NDEs are real and prove that there is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. And while the Bible and the Qu'ran convinces few people who do not already believe, the book in pic related is known to convince even hardened skeptics that there is an afterlife.
Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:
https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]
It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 
"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."
Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.
Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:
"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."
Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.
So the existence of an afterlife is a fact now and pic related is literal proof of it.

Why are men more honest than women? 
Why do women like to say the value honesty and integrity but then go around being liars and deceivers?
It's like it kills them to tell the truth. Men are an open book. We will straight up tell you what we are thinking and feeling and our ACTIONS are 
in alignment with our thoughts, feelings and words.
For some reason women only like the truth when it benefits them and will go silent if you ask them a direct question and tell them to be honest.
They know what the truth is but they don't want to say it out loud or admit the truth. They'd rather the whole world burn down than to be honest.
The only time men are lying to a high degree is when they're cheating and that's just in that scenario as both genders lie while cheating.
For women, lying is on 24/7. They lie so much that it's shocking to men (and women) when you see them tell the full truth to men.
Seems like honesty and integrity is a male trait, an XY trait, if you will.

Women want to live a fantasy. This is why they love gold, crystals, superstition, palm reading, astrology and fairytales. The real world is transparently cruel so women smokescreen things that would bring pain and displeasure to get people where they want them. Men can build things that make them happy. Women have to believe nonsense to be happy.

Read Psychological Types, Jung predicted this.

Men have physical strength therefore are able to express themselves freely. Women are biologically weak therefore must hide their true intentions and adjust to the situation so they don't get beat to death by an angry caveman.

you'd lie too if you got away with as easily as they do, if everyone brushed it off saying ''thats just how men are lol. nothing to do about it unless you want to live without them.''

Men have more testosterone. You see how autists are often described as being honest to a, fault. Women have little testosterone and additionally much higher estrogen levels. Estrogen is highly correlated with antisocial behavior like deceit, theft, and violence.

Kind of falls flat once you realize women lie about everything, even inconsequential things. A lot of lies women tell are to hide from getting what they deserve but I think that's just a side effect. Women feel great joy is telling lies. It's reward enough that they simply mislead someone with their words and actions. If they were actually scared of getting caveman'd they would simply refrain from doing bad things.

It's because women are evil. They are half demons while men are fully human

Every time I lie the guilt inside puts me in agony and eats me up I can't do it. I cannot comprehend how anyone can lie and hurt others do some people just not have empathy?

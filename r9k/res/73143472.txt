Please help me /r9k/
What do I do /r9k/? She's obviously insane with the train episode but I don't know, I like her. I don't have a number or anything. When I asked her what her name is she said she had not needed one for a while. I haven't been able to sleep because I'm thinking about her. I'm tired. I won't see her until Monday at work. I have no pictures yet.
Rape her as soon as possible anon 
r/advice
Ok, stay away from crazy women. But...if you want to go for it, talk with her. She seems really shy and disturbed, try to make her open up slowly and do it as well, then ask her out. Or if you want to be a Chad, just bring the train episode up, and say without saying that it was really funny and interesting, say that you can relate without saying that you can relate, and ask her out. Since she is really shy and awkward, maybe a direct approach won't work, unless you are a beast in social skills.

Imagine getting mogged by your own brother
<comment>
I don't have to imagine that. I am a handsome guy but my brother is a super Chad. He looks like he could play Clark Kent/Superman and his life is a constant stream of female attention.

nothing will ever beat Ashton kutcher and his twin

I'm a truecel but my brother is a gigachad.
<comment>
my friend is like you. good looking guy, but his older brother was better looking and all of his friends wanted to fuck him.
<comment>
Iktf to some extent, my brother is better looking than me and we lived near each other in college. When we hung out it was brutal the difference in female attention each of us would get. My bro and I would be talking to each other, then a girl would come over and talk to him exclusively. It's brutal to feel the power of looks that intensely and fully realize what you're missing out on, we were literally both just sitting there and talking normally, and she approached him instead of me solely on looks difference. The difference in body language would hurt too, she would fully be facing him and not even pretend to give a shit about me, giving him full, eager eye contact, asking him questions etc. Fucking sucked.

he's just fat. if he lost weight he'll be chadlite at the very least and still be able to pull.
<comment>
does he treat u right at lteast?
<comment>
Yeah and I tried to not cockblock him in return. Didn't make it hurt any less though.

i feel like that's almost impossible if he's as good looking as you make him out to be, lol. is he real with you about the whole situation or try to blow smoke up your ass and say it's his confidence or other platitudes?
<comment>
He usually blows smoke about it, but I don't take it personally since attractive people usually want to believe their looks are a small part of their romantic success. Why embrace how ugly and brutal reality is if you don't have to I guess is their feeling. At the end of the day he's my brother so I'm not going to force him to see ugly truths for no good reason
<comment>
I get that, he's kind to you after all. Mind sharing what he explains in those situations though, the reason for the attention? He didn't do anything special to me it seemed when you guys were talking and I'm curious to hear the thoughts of a person.

My overall impression is that looks get your foot in the door and personality seals the deal, obviously girls would prefer both if they can get it. I don't want to get too specific, but basically his overall take is that confidence and the like are very important. Girls want to feel like they're with the man, and if you act very confidently, then people will usually treat you in turn. Basically being 'cool' is essential to getting girls since it implies you're high status/can get shit done, and it puts them at ease in terms of their own anxieties

I am 5'9" and my bro is 6'3"
Guess who gets laid all the time and who is a virgin.

is this something that you personally believe, or that looks is what affects how personality is perceived?
<comment>
*or is it possible that looks is what affects how personality is perceived?
<comment>
It's both and, there are more ways to have a good/attractive personality than being confident, and even different types of confidence. Usually people think of confidence as brash, but that isn't always the case, and usually looks best on a big, attractive guy who can pull that off well. A nerdy, smart guy can pull off a quieter confidence that intelligence women are more likely to pick up on or value. I guess it's about knowing and leaning into your strengths. You can even alter your looks/style to better suit your personality and who you are and/or want to be. Not sure if that really answers your question, but I guess what I'm saying is that looks and personality for guys are give and take, it isn't a one way influence
<comment>
If what you say is true, am I assuming correctly that you are still getting your share even if it's not as easy as it is for him?
<comment>
I'm not, but that's because I'm a shut in. I do stuff with women online, but that's hardly comparable to irl success. Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I'm pretty confident I could transition my online success to irl pretty easily so long as I took better care of how I look
<comment>
alright, hope you become the next pussy slayer9000 soon. take care and thanks for answering my questions.
<comment>
Appreciate it, good luck to you too anon
<comment>
Can I please get a visual of one of these guys? Censor eyes if you want, but I need to see
<comment>
What bothers me the most is the good looking guy knows what he's doing.
Shouldn't be surprised, this world is awful.
<comment>
had to look it up.
i'd neck myself if my twin was an actor and hollywood sex symbol while i looked like nerd.

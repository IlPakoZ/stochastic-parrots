"For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." Mt 18:20
Laud Deo Virginique Matri

Orthodox brothers and sisters are welcome as long as they long as they accept Filioque and Primus Inter Pares
<comment>
What does that mean? Isn't God, like, everywhere already?
<comment>
look at it as if it was only potentially. God is everywhere but when we gather in His name He is there fully. He is not only there but also present with us. 
you can not grasp it with material logic

I committed one of Sins that cry to Heaven for Vengeance. I can never be chaste. For i threw it all away. I want to burn.

Hello gents. How has your evening/morning/night been?
<comment>
Where do you get the motivation to pray the rosary everyday? It takes about 30 minutes to finish.

The funny thing about volcels is that they wouldn't get a gf even if they tried

Tridentine Mass: yay or nay?

I heavily prefer being alone and feel closest to Christ when I am hiking in the woods compared to going to church. 
Is this bad? I am 100% a Christian, but I prefer the monastic aspects of the spiritual life. I just want to live a meek life. One of my biggest inspirations are the monks who dropped out of society and lived in caves. 
A lot of these cave dwelling Christians are now Saints, so I don't believe it to be bad, but many fellow Christians criticize me for never waking up Sunday for church. I just love being alone, I don't feel a spiritual need for me to drive down to church and listen to a sermon about a chapter I've read 50 times already.

Ive had a gf but never wanted to have sex and woudnt if i still did. It seems overwhelmingly retarded and shortsighted

Why do Catholics like this movie so much?
<comment>
Pray to the Mother of God and the Saints to intercede for your sins. it is our spiritual right to ask for mercy.
hello, it's already late in the night for me. it was an okay day, how about yours?
i'm not gonna lie i dont pray the rosary. i want to start again tho. for praying in general i'd say the motivation is that prayer makes you feel instantly like in heaven. it's not about entering the Kingdom in the future but letting it come now to you.
yay but i don't think is fair to rebel against the Church because of that.

I was actually a sex addict before I chose volcel. First gf was at 16, took my virginity, after that I had 3 gf's from age 16-18, then at 18 I started dating the girl I had a crush on since literally 6th grade. We dated for 4 years.
After that I used online dating and had a few 6-12 month relationships, and sad to admit lots of casual sex.
It wasn't until around 2019 that I chose to go full volcel. I feel much closer to God when I'm not cooming, period. Cooming, for me personally, is spiritual poison.

I refuse to ask to their help usually. They know what i have done. I will not face them. I do not deserve their help. I am especially not talking to her
<comment>
Its late for me too. Today was alright, called a few people for work related stuff then had a few pints with my dad and sister. Decent day overall:)
<comment>
This is a very interesting take. first of all, I dont think there's nothing wrong or anything to feel bad about. I prefer it too, but i realised that in some way it was out of pride. i didnt like the community or didnt like aesthetically what was going on but maybe God wants us to embrace that aspect of religiosity and life itself too. maybe not and your path is different. i can't talk with any authority, i am a sinner and i'm looking forward to rehabilitate myself but i'm not even going to church or anything lately.
very inspiring testimony. most of the times we ourself aren't inclined to sin but the world screams louder.
i know that feeling. i refused especially to talk to her too. i refused to ask for forgiveness but thats the devil's will. we are supossed to ask for help and forgiveness. don't feel ashamed, even if they know, it's part of our free will to be helped if we ask to be helped. sabotaging yourself is only leading to more suffering. just talk to them, just pray. dont feel unworthy, you are not.

This is why I hate church. God made brains, and He wants us to use them.

I did something that warrants death according to leviticus. Every moment for the past 15 months has felt as though i am living on time i do not deserve. I want justice to be carried out. Even if that means that i cannot be with god when i die.
I am not talking to somebody who is perfectly sinless. I have nothing to say to her.
Every ounce of suffering i endure in this life cannot remit the evil i have created, nor does it amount of even the smallest measurable fraction of what i deserve.
There is nothing left for me to do but wait until my life ends. I can pretend to be a normal person until that day
<comment>
i can see by your pain that you have repented. i am not a priest so i can't give you advice or solutions as one could. but i'll say that we are not ruled by Leviticus, if it was so eating lobster would be a sin. even if you sinned you should talk to a priest and confess your sins. I feel same as you since i have blasphemed and am afraid that my sin is unforgivable. it's good that you chose acceptance, but you don't have to give up on God and the saints. remember that by doing this you are not only depriving yourself of them, but also depriving them of you when they might need you.
<comment>
What is did is still a grave sin according to the catechism. While the law of leviticus does not bind us, it is true that the debt to justice is still them same. I should be dead, even if i cannot be executed.
the saints
They have no need for me, for they are already in the presence of God. There is nothing i can fo that is good for them. 
As for what i did, i wasnt absolved as i lost the nerve to be completely honest at my last confession. I have become more depraved
<comment>
i am inclined to ask what you did out of curiosity and given the anonimity but i don't know if you wanna share or if is it even good to be asking. in any case you have to surrender everything to the Church, even your pain, that's the good thing, your sin is not for you to bear, by not confessing and potentially being absolved you are depriving Christ to have been sacrified for this too. you never know what the saints or God wants from us so we should keep them away from us. for this is our only power, to stray away from God and not letting Him help us. What you are experiencing is pride too

Catholicism is a false religion. Catholics are among those God talks about in Matthew 7:21-23.
<comment>
It was a sexual act. Thats all i will say
<comment>
then trust our tradition and acknowledge that we can not judge ourselves. you must confess and pay obedience.
<comment>
Just checking in Catholicbros, and I want to let you know that sacramental confession works and grants grace.
Also that Divine Mercy Chaplets can be said pretty quickly.
Deo gratia and fight on, church militant!

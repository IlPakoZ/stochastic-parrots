The Idiot is a song by Stan Rogers. It describes a young man leaving his hometown for an earned life, despite the fact he could just live on welfare back home. And you should know about it.
Take the idiotpill. Get in your car, on a train, hitchhike, whatever. Go somewhere and become something. Don't let your souls keep rotting. Make yourself a man. It's not going to happen by chance.
The northwest passage is a better song
It's a better song, but it definitely doesn't get me off my ass and outside working.
Listen to one piece at a time or its finally friday if you wanna get up and going
I'll give them a go eventually, but I'm resting now. It's been a long day, and I saw some welfare fag here, and it made me fucking angry. Anyone able bodies and able minded should be working for something. I can't sit back and just fucking watch them rot without making at least an attempt to kick them into gear.

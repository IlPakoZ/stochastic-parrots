haha, im going to sigma-grindset max to make up for the fact that im a virgin at 24 and i missed out on teenage love and the normal developmental milestones and romantic experiences!
bro, older women are TOTALLY better than younger ones, young virgin girls are overrated, trust me, old used up hags are THE BEST!

I mean if you have an actual goal or reason that would be achieved by said self improvement no. If you dont yes. For example
i want to work out to get ladies
Will you leave your house and interact with ladies when you have a better body?
no
Thats cope, you are playing at making a change while not actually confronting the issue you have.
i want to work out so I am stronger and my body feels better
working out directly accomplishes this
In this scenario its not cope it was a method to achieve the sought after goal.

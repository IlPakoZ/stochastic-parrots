Anyone else not particularly bothered by a being a virgin? Yeah having a gf would be nice, but being a KV never got in the way of me finding a way to enjoy life.

I'm not a virgin but no it doesn't bother me
<comment>
How do you manage to enjoy life?
<comment>
Yeah, it doesnt bother me either. Normies just make you think that having a partner is important and being single is >sad&lt;.
Why are you here alone in a mall alone, anon?
God, shut up. Im happy alone. They even convinced many of us, like incels.

i'm not exactly happy about it but virgin > fucking some random hoe anytime
maybe i'm just coping but i really do value my intimacy, i don't allow people to get too close
<comment>
It didn't bother me from ages 14-20 but then it did around 21-24 and now I've gone full circle and it doesn't bother me anymore

You say this but all living things are biologically hardwired to reproduce.
At some point your biological imperatives will kick in and they will kick in hard and any shred of enjoyment you have in life will be replaced by frustration.

Yeah, i'm pretty indifferent about it nowadays. It used to bother me because i thought there was something terribly wrong with me and that i would never be with a woman. But now i know there's nothing wrong with me and the only reason i don't get laid is because i don't go out much. So i don't think it's a big deal anymore. I know it will happen eventually.

I just don't give a fuck anymore. I also hate women like nobody can imagine and wish to never have to deal with them. Hell, I don't want to deal with anyone in person or over the phone.
biologically hardwired to reproduce
So? If people cared about that then birth control would be made illegal, age of consent would be abolished, and men could go around raping anyone we wanted just like animals do.

Virgin shame is an instinct in men you can rationalize all you want but it still stings
<comment>
Being fearful of those that look different from you is an instinct that everyone in human history has had, yet if you say that today you're considered a racist and some kind of "phobe'.
<comment>
You mean disgusted at not fearful of
<comment>
Yeah I used to care when I was a teenager but I just don't give a shit anymore. Not having a normfaggot sexhaver friendgroup who all rag on me for being a virgin probably helps. I worry about the fuckups and inadequacies of mine which I consider greater.
<comment>
No, people always feared those that are different and saw the other as inferior. Doesn't matter what race or ethnicity, it has always been that way.
<comment>
No they are disgusted at other races not fearful of them

I'm 30 now and my biological clock seems to be broken.

If you've never seen blacks before and then out of nowhere see a hoard of them burning down a city, your first reaction would be fear of those people. If aliens landed, people will immediately be fearful of what they might do to humans.

I can definitely say from experience that simply fucking alone doesn't scratch that biological itch for long. Having meaningless sex without reproducing is barely a step above masturbating. That "urge to reproduce" can only sated two ways: having kids, or aging past your sexual prime.

I may not be a virgin, but I haven't gotten laid in 9 years. I'm still waiting.
<comment>
Thats fine. I've been spit on by normies all my life. One more drop doesnt make ocean larger or smaller.
<comment>
I'm too autistic to want intimacy with another human being.
I've learned to find happiness on my own.

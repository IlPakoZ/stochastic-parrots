I dont react normally to social conflicts anymore, I take them way too seriously. Help me, anons.
My life has been a downward spiral for years now. Every now and then I've made this same post, asking for your help to stop the monster inside me. I've tried and tried. Ended up all alone. Years of loneliness, no sex, and no meaningful life have made me frustrated. The only people I have are vindictive assholes on the Internet who push my buttons all day long.
Today I got aggressively scolded by a coworker. Couldn't handle it, so I torched his car. Literally poured gasoline all over his car and torched it.
I wasnt like this in the past. I was the nicest guy you could've known. But the weird part is, I don't feel bad about what I did. There's no shame, but no catharsis either. I have this scary feeling that my brain thinks I'm within my rights when I defend myself against the injustice of society. My reactions are out of proportion, probably due to some kind of mental breakdown.

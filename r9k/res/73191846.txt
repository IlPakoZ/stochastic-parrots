How come feminism is way more polarizing than race issues?
As in, it's relatively easy to get people to see male-centered issues and that they face disadvantages. You can never do this with race. Why?

I'm not sure your premise is true
The media spends a lot of time talking about systemic racism of the judicial system, but not once will you see FOX or CNN/MSNBC bring up systemic sexism in our judicial system

I mean its way easier to talk about this than it is to talk about anti-white racism. As in, talking about how men are victims of certain things garners more sympathy from the general public in comparison.

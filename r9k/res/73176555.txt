you and a group of other students teased pic related for being fat in high school
it never really became bullying, since she teased you and your friends back about random shit, but sometimes it really bothered her
five years later
she texts you, sends the right pic, and says that she's coming to beat the shit out of you
says that she practiced Krav Maga and weightlifting in college
when you threaten to call the cops, she says that she was just kidding and would like to catch up
How do you respond?
<comment>
Ghost her, like all the other old friends that have contacted me to catch up

five years later
It will be 10 years since I left school this year. Wonder where that time went

I'm really proud of you, anon. That must've taken so much effort to achieve such great results. I'm so sorry if I ever hurt your feelings in the past, I was a foolish, inconsiderate child who clearly should've thought more about his words.

Would never happen, since I didn't bully anyone in high school and was just nice to them. So once she gets the glow-up, she'd ignore folks like me and go for the ones who actually were kinda mean to her, since that's more 'exciting' or whatever
<comment>
be presented a hypothetical 
"yea but I never did that"
People like you are the fucking worst.

she's coming to beat the shit out of you
This is where she would lose me. I would be all for apologizing for being a stupid kid but I don't tolerate physical threats
<comment>
WRONG
I wouldn't have bullied a chubby woman. I would've bullied the fit woman in to being fat. Also sauce on the left one anon? She's cute.
<comment>
well now I am fat so she would humiliate me I guess and I would totally let her
<comment>
Convince her to become fat again but continue weightlifting

How do you respond?
Ghost her, like all the other old friends that have contacted me to catch up
uwu mommy yes please beat me up for being a bad boy
It will be 10 years since I left school this year. Wonder where that time went
Would never happen, since I didn't bully anyone in high school and was just nice to them. So once she gets the glow-up, she'd ignore folks like me and go for the ones who actually were kinda mean to her, since that's more 'exciting' or whatever
People like you are the fucking worst.
Immersion ruined.
Lets dance
This is where she would lose me. I would be all for apologizing for being a stupid kid but I don't tolerate physical threats
WRONG
I wouldn't have bullied a chubby woman. I would've bullied the fit woman in to being fat. Also sauce on the left one anon? She's cute.
well now I am fat so she would humiliate me I guess and I would totally let her
Convince her to become fat again but continue weightlifting

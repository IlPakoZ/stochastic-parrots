tfw a grown man in his late twenties
bitter and miserable at life because he can't be a cute girl
lmao my life is a joke

Save up money, put your hopes in molecular biology and regenerative medicine. You want age reversal tech and artificial tissue stuff to be realized.

it would have to be some miracle tech that could give me an entirely new body and probably undo years of mental trauma and masculinization
<comment>
Eh, it's not really miracle tech but it'll be well into the future for sure. I've had my own hypothetical ideas about spinal cord splicing and enlengthening/shortening and there are plenty of bits of data that we have currently that suggest we're close to solving many of the issues aligned with aging. Slowing down the aging process significantly seems on the horizon and reversing it might not be too long after we hit that point. Artificial tissues are going to be a larger problem and as far as your trauma goes you can recover.

slowing down aging and achieving biological immortality is one thing but i'm not satisfied with just that
the list of shit i want to change about myself goes on and on. some of the more obvious ones
shorter so i'm actually a normal female height
less masculine skull and skeleton
ribcage smaller
huge booba because i'm a gross fetishist
and that's just the physical changes. i'm also mentally ill as fuck lol

Well, I'll just say anything that any other animal does is theoretically possible for us to develop means of replicating or even reversing. This means reduction of bones without just up and making you new ones(which is a growing possibility, we already utilize cadaver bone to make new bone that's inferior to the actual stuff but the body does utilize and does its job well enough.). The spine shortening would likely be your biggest hurdle and it should be possible, just not with current tech. The age reversal/biological immortality is just the means of getting to where you want to be and staying there. What're your mental ailments though, OP?

i'm don't have a lot of hope. some of my measurements are well into the "large for men" category. even some sort of magical brain transplant seems unlikely, don't even know if my brain would fit in a normal sized female skull. i have to change so much that i'm basically just asking for an entirely new body because masculinization has fucked me
spine shortening
what's the point of that, height reduction?
What're your mental ailments though, OP?
i don't really want to run off and self diagnose, but even something as simple as anger issues, i get mad way too easily

Females actually have larger brain volumes on average compared to men, from what I remember, when scaled to height. I might be misremembering but your brain's size is not likely to be an issue.
what's the point of that, height reduction?
Exactly. Limbs can only be shortened so much and doing so looks off, take dwarves as an example.
i don't really want to run off and self diagnose, but even something as simple as anger issues, i get mad way too easily
What kind of things make you mad and are you incapable of controlling yourself when you're like that? Out of curiosity have you had any head injuries in the past? That sort of thing is pretty common with head injuries.

thought it was the opposite. it's depressing how big men's heads are and how differently their skulls are shaped compared to womens
when scaled to height.
well, i'd like to be shorter.
What kind of things make you mad
everything really. i get pissed off at even the most minor of things.
are you incapable of controlling yourself when you're like that?
if i'm angry enough yes. there's probably a psychological or biological reason i am like this. 
Out of curiosity have you had any head injuries in the past?
not really? like i've banged my head on things but nothing i've ever been hospitalized for
i just do not see how to get from who i am now, to who i want to be.

Well a good portion of that larger head is your larger jaw and other bones that fuse together for your skull. Evolutionarily male heads are the ones who took beatings and thus have evolved to be more robust. Weak jaws in particularly pose a major risk to one's well-being in that kind of environment as a broken jaw can be a death sentence and good blows to the jaw can more easily knock one out.
well, i'd like to be shorter.
You still definitely should be able to. How tall are you right now anyhow?

You're not on any ADHD medication, are you? Has it always been like this or is this something that has developed as you grew up?
i just do not see how to get from who i am now, to who i want to be.
Just focus on getting money, security(like a nice place to live, your health in order, investments, etc.) and work on your mental issues. As far as I see either age reversal becomes a thing or humanity itself collapses. No matter which scenario happens it's just best to try and look out for yourself for when it happens.

yeah. jaw and forehead. mine are well defined, closer to chad than virgin, but it's also just proportions. male midfaces are longer, make skulls are wider, etc.
You're not on any ADHD medication, are you? 
no but i am considering it, why do you ask?
Just focus on getting money, security(like a nice place to live, your health in order, investments, etc.) 
that is one route. honestly, it's interesting you bring up medical research. i've seriously considered trying to work in the field, even just as a cope for not being a cute girl.
and work on your mental issues.
i'm trying. i don't want to fuck up or be dependent on medication for life. i've even considered psilocybin to try and work through, but since i know so little about the risks i haven't fucked around with it
i must go, have a good day.

Well, I asked before on the ADHD medication because I know that can be a complication. I've talked to someone before who actually developed pretty crippling anger problems whilst on Adderall.
i've seriously considered trying to work in the field, even just as a cope for not being a cute girl.
I honestly wish I didn't throw away my future sometimes, just so I could actually get into medicine and molecular bio. All of this stuff just interests me a lot.

I think mostly with psilocybin it's more about its potential in treating depression and PTSD than anything with anger, but I haven't looked too deep into all of that. I wish I had some good alternatives, especially away from any medicine but I sadly don't.
i must go, have a good day.
Hope you feel better and have a nice day, OP.

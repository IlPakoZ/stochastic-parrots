Who do women hate incels and single men who complain about being alone when both of them have zero power in their life?
Like yeah they are people who generalize about women but nobody takes them seriously, so who cares?
Just let them be and keep going with your life
Saying this because I was seeing posta about how there are more single young men than single young woman and i encountered one where women were mostly complaining about how it was the consequences of their actor, that they werent the ones at fault, that single women are happier, that they dont have any reason to care about them, etc. 
And for one part i can understand that women just dont want a partner nowdays, thats fine. but then why do care about what men says about you when you arent interested to them? why are you mad about men venting about their problem? 
that would be like if MGTOW started to complain about thirty years old women complaining about how hard is to get a man, there is just no reason to care about something you supossedly dont care

Women wouldn't actually attack someone who did have power, or they'd soon be reminded how things really work. That's why they attack the acceptable targets.

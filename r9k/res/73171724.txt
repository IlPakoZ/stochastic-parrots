Is there any way to instill a sense of discipline in your self if you're 26 already and your parents were losers? Every day I say I'm going to clean the room, look for jobs, etc but my body just won't do it. I gave no idea whats wrong with me I wish I just wasn't such a pussy about having discipline/motivation
Stand up right now. Clean your desk. Just your desk. Come back and tell us when you completed the task.
I'm joining the military as a last ditch effort type thing. Every time I ask someone how they work every day the answer is always some form of "I have to" I will never have to in the situation I am in. Family keeps offering me ways to live completely risk and work free, so I need to put myself in a situation where I don't have access to that anymore. I hope I am not too weak.
It might not be an issue with discipline or motivation; you might be disabled and have executive dysfunction
I wonder if you can get that from drinking too much, if so that's probably it, I already have permanent damage to one organ from drinking so I guess I have wet brain too :/
Well I opted to shower and take out the trash since I'm probably going to bed, but first thing tomorrow, promise
Stop making excuses anon.
You racking sense of disciprine. Shamefur dispray.
One task = one tendie. Very effective system
Even, dishonorabre....
this is probably not a healthy answer, but I use drugs. even just weed and/or alcohol is fine. I can never bring myself to cook because I'm lazy and don't feel like it but after I take a couple shots I'm so ready and down to cook.

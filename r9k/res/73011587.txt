Don't tell me you're one of those manual laborer guys.... Why do you take so much pride in your work? It's literally just dumb dumb peepee brain work where you get paid wageslavery+$2 an hour. You guys aren't NASA scientists you know.

Anyone who says that meaningful work that involves skill and physical activity isnt validating and will not improve your life is a clueless NEET.

I can't work, it's either autism or ADHD.
Prefer to be alone
Can't Work in groups
Will probably fuck up simple tasks
Easily frustrated and distracted
Can't be a team player / leader
Fix my sleep schedule
I'm also too old, I'm 28 with no HS diploma or work experience outside a summer job from nearly 12 years ago.
I'm not a normalfag, normalfags will pick up on this and deride me until I snap.

bro just drown out your suffering by consuming video games and finding new hobbies
why do normies always suggest this shit to any problem, it's equivocal to saying "just drown your sorrows"

It give opportunities to gain knowledge about something, which can than be used in conversations, which leads to socializing in a somewhat pleasant manner, which may lead to platonic relationships which can potentially lead to romantic ones.
Even the hobby of "drinking" can be leveraged like this. Everybody loves hearing facts about various alcoholic beverages. There's a difference I guess between having drinking as a hobby as opposed to "drowning your sorrows"

I say this because I don't know what else to say, I'm not very good at finding happiness. Even if I was, I'm too stupid to properly communicate how I achieved it.
Sorry to bother you.

What else would they say? You either solve your problems or ignore them. Those are the only two options.

If you find a good hobby it can become something you're truly passionate besides just doing it for the sake of avoiding your issues. It can give you another world to explore.

yeah if you're stooping so low that you're posting here I guarantee you that your problems are Unsolvable, so you might as well enjoy some video games and "drown out your suffering" or whatever

middle age virgin man with anxiety afraid to see his overbearing parent
director - i want to put you in the experience of being a loser
every review - man this guy is a fucking loser
this is how hollywood sees you /r9k/ this is what the rest of the world thinks of you, they put 35 million dollars into a movie that calls you a fucking loser
Rule of thumb: Always believe the opposite of what (((Hollywood and the media critics))) think.
do not do this, that is the road to being an incel
They did all that just for me haha
Watched it - it's about seeing the world through the eyes of a paranoid schizophrenic, only you later discover everything was an elaborate plot set up by his mother, but since that's how a para kid schizo mind thinks it's probably part of his delusion. Lots of symbolism, lots of hilarious over the top misfortune and misadventures.
He blames his mother for everything wrong with him even though he's clearly mentally retarded. 
I won't argue that he's an incel, the way women are all portrayed as these psychotic neurotic, screening abusing and unpredictable demons is probably how a lot of anons see women

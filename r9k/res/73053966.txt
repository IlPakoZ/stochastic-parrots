The real black pill is this: sex is best enjoyed as a teen and in early 20s. After that, sex drive goes down, sex becomes less exciting simply put. Therefore if miss out on sex in the phase of life where its exciting (and the girls are hottest), you have missed out indeed. Enjoy your boomer sex though
I don't care anymore, it's true at this age i dont care about sex as much anymore but I just want companionship and intimacy.
Why would I want intimacy with some fucking slag, it truly is over
True. I'm 32 and my penis is completely dead. I haven't gotten a "random" erection in like 10 years.
It wouldnt be so bad if I didnt miss the boat, but because I did Im feeling pretty suicidal over it. Im so envious of all guys who are or were players
I experienced teen sex, it is garbage and I dont care about it, I want love
if that is the black pill then what is the white pill
having sex with teenagers at age 30+ to relive those moments successfully?

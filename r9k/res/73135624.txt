Obscure
Filthy frank is literal normie culture
What the fuck are you talking about

Did you not use the internet from 2014 to 2018? 
How you not know the fag

did he go in the pink suit?

He's just the guy responsible for the Harlem Shake meme, not much else. If it wasn't for that (incidentally his Pink Guy character appeared in that original video, he probably milked it hard in an attempt to become famous), no one would know who he is.

Im sure I was aware of the rice fields bitch meme but didnt know who was behind it. I came to this shithole website through newgrounds and ytmnd and mudkipz when Bush was president so by frankstime I was already an out of touch geezer
Regular pleb outfit. I have my coworkers contact still so i could theoretically get in touch with the guy

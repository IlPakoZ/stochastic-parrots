Is it bad to sleep in your clothes? 
I've heard it is, but I never got a reason for why.

Please tell me why the car is in the front yard.

I think there was some autism about circulation, but it's probably a hygiene thing. You don't want to drag the dirt from a workday into your bed or keep wearing the same clothes because they start to smell. If you're a clean NEET then I don't see the issue.

It's probably uncomfortable
Same fabric that's been on you gets bacerial growth
Stinky
Dirty
Tight clothes generally not good for blood
Something psychological about changing clothes/transitioning to sleep
There's been weeks I had to wear the same clothes including while sleeping. After three days things start to get crusty which is very uncomfortable. At the very minimum change socks and air out clothes and body.

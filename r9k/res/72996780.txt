ITT post the psychotic shit you fantasize about as you go to sleep.
i just think of some cozy hogwarts-esque day dream anon why would i think of psychotic things
Have a fantasy of being a Targaryen prince
fantasize about me having servant/slave girls to mess with
engaging in the most degenerate and filthy stuff possible
flaunt my degeneracy as well to piss off my asshole Targ King father
Don't care about being a piece of shit son because I'm still a Targ Prince and will get away with whatever I'm doing
I like fantasizing about beating up and emotionally manipulating a girl so successfully she doesn't want to leave me. She will always be my girlfriend.
see flames ripping across the viewport of my drop pod
the display to my left dimly counting down until impact
15 seconds left
think about how hungry I am and mentally kick myself for missing breakfast
impact
my QRF team has been tasked with the preliminary response of another demon outbreak on a surface colony
see a few signatures on my HUD in the distance
radio to rest of squad
our marksman vaporizes them in short time
continue moving towards rally point
group up with everyone else in the QRF 
fan out and move towards hive location
demonic response is surprisingly low for a hive of this size
demo engineers plant their charges and we GTFO
I'm buddies with one of the demos so he let's me use the remote detonator
EXPLOSION.wave
hike back to exfil point and get picked up by Intraorbital transport ship
return to the space station sitting and orbit
chow down on some food, take a shower, and pass out immediately after

How do you convince yourself to stop neeting? 
I'm tired of living like an overgrown teenager. I want love, romance, my own car, a place of my own etc. I want to leave r9k
You start by leaving /r9k/.
Leave r9k and start doing the things you know you should be doing. Those things you least want to be doing. It's gonna suck, but it will get better. Winning over yourself is an amazing feeling.
You guys were my only friends though at the lowest point of my life, I don't want to leave. Also maybe I'm lazy

You're here forever!
Fuck you, I'm gonna make it, thanks anon
I know that feeling but this board is the crab mentality's personification. If you truly want to escape you have to let go. I tried to leave this place but due to my loneliness and the exact feeling that you have (people having similar experiences here and being more relatable) I came back. As shit as it may sound, you have to try becoming a normalfag and socialise. After all, you are trying to participate in society.
Gtfo here, anon. Its for your own good
just run out of money bro.
i had to start working when my mom started charging me rent to live at home. moved out shortly after that.
after living on my own going back to live at moms is suicide tier.
You need to work to change your habits step by step, it will be very uncomfortable and intimidating but it's the only way
just leave the house lol
what the fuck you want to do but are unable to?

God will never leave me nor forsake me 
He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.

Salvation is free 
You can pray to God whenever you want
We're made for labour and we love to labour 
Girls are pretty 
It's ridiculous how much God has loved us, looking at the world He made for us. All glory and praise and worship be to the LORD our God, our Father in heaven.

Now THIS is a thread I can get behind.
EXPOSE THE WICKED
SHUN THE DARKNESS
EMBRACE THE LIGHT OF GOD
BE SAVED

amen anon :) 
I was out in darkness and I could not see
Jesus came and he rescued me
He claimed me and gave me a victory
Glory, hallelujah

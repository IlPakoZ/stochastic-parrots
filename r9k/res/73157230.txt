Alcohol can help you with the initial talking if you have a panic attack everytime. If not, dress well, go out and talk with a female, go to a grocery store, get small talk with the girls there, nothing unusual, just the weather or something, you can even plan ahead, if they are too busy, find another one. That would be a first step. Second step is to go to a social event, if you can't, go to a bar and talk with people, having a friend and going to the right places would help. After you get less troubled by that, talk with the girls. If a girl is looking at you talk with her, if you think she is into you try to kiss her, don't be weird and it will be fine. You will get misses, but you can meet someone. Idk how it will go, but if you think that is not for you, and you have something interesting in you, talk with any girl anywhere if she doesn't ignore you, if she doesn't want to talk, you don't talk. Always dress well, try not to be too weird, don't hush things, have a little respect, and don't mind the misses, you actually can get there. 
That was an oversimplification, from an autist to a normie, if you are autistic you might need a few more steps. A good tip is to ask your dad or even your grampa if you have one.
When I try to talk to women at the store, or anywhere really, they just give one word responses which immediately kill the conversation. Or they just straight up say they dont want to talk to me. Idk what to do

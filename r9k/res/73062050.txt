lads are you taking your apus phones off them for the alert later? mine doesnt watch the news and im not sure he would understand the concept of a test of this nature. hes timid and would frighten him half to death if he sees the alert de lids, but how can he watch his sunday wikwoks if I take his phone away? poor lid would think hes done something wrong. in a bit of a pickle. he is a West Pennine Pondskipper if anyone is familiar with the breed.

... And that's a wrap-up for the first run since the distance relationship took off in earnest. 
(All the w*stoid women on these apps are as trashy and degenerate as ever thoughbeit; This can't really be helped i guess but at least i now know which precise corner i should be focussing on and pivot towards if i want to run into breedable-enough specimen)
Not even bothering to check for her response until the deadline i've set to her is up either, based on her prior behaviour i know she's already monkeybranching too and won't be giving it a chance to bloom either way... Her choice to be a future eggcel then i guess.
If the woman had not been *THIS* incredibly fucking paranoid from the very outset then the whole thing might have had a chance to hold up in the long term. 
I put a shitton of effort into it, did it all by the freaking book and all i got was this half-assed, paranoid bullshit and destructive, non-constructive shitty behaviour from her in response. Another lesson about w*hminoids learned i guess lol, they're being destructive like this for the pure sake/thrill of it apparently
Again though; Least i got me BWC wet many times, for this had been *very* sorely needed after all this time. Visiting a prozzie is cheaper and easier overall i fink tbqfh

two flaws in your plan:
1. visiting a prozzie means you will get your needs satisfied but will NOT have children.
2. any children created by you will have YOUR genes.

Another thing to add is that i'm matching with the kinds of stacy lites i didn't really used to match with a mere 2 or 3 years ago, we're talking real decent 8/10ish and up specimen - It's actually true what they say about male SMV steadily increasing with age. Liftmaxxing for a year or so would probably quite the prudent thing to do, after sorting the other stuff out too

Forgot to say, you don't turn the oven on, no need as they never check the oven. That's how the nazis got away with it for so long, UN's weapons inspectors never checked saddams ovens, and that's where he kept his nukes. They were smuggled out to putin, whilst Jawad al-Maliki was having the kitchen renovated. He'd not seen them, as he lived exclusively on halal pot noodles until the kitchen was finished.

what percentage of your phones received the alert lads?
40% here. two fifths of me would have been dead in a flood or nuclear strike.

You need to turn it back on now, so you know when the aliens land.
<comment>
0% of my phone received the alert. How did your phone receive the 40%, was it most of the message, or part of the noise?
Also, sorry to do this, but, two fifths is 1 tenths.

Going to buy twitter blue. Not even bothered about the politics of it all I think its funny how everyones getting so mad over it. I read theres campaigns called 'block the blue' whereby people are trying to bankrupt twitter by brigading subscription havers.
I think ill jump into the fun. I think this is Elons strategy. He knows just how annoying the coddled low IQ echo chamber people are and he can use that against the normal population to make them hate them and maybe even give twitter a go. 
Twitter blue, here I come!

Is it a one off payment of 10 bong?
<comment>
better off saving that for some auditing equipment!
<comment>
No. 10 pound every MONTH. or 100 a year. Everyone is chimping out but its because all the twitter degenerates have spent all their lives trying their hardest to do whatever it takes to get a fancy blue tick. Now that anyone can get one with a subscription theyre all freaking out. To the point where the weird people are blocking any tick on sight. Theyre seething. I want to sign up just for that. It'd be worth sending 100 to twitter.

gonna sound weird but need some advice on moving to england
built up good savings over the past few years from part time jobs and inheritances, will be guaranteed enough a month to pay for rent food and then 300 or so to go to fuckall i could want. gap year is up so im using uni as an excuse to leave the states, applying to a few on tuesday (know im late to it but worth a shot) able to claim dual nat off of my dad as well so none of that diplomatic shite has to be dealt with
staying away from larger cities like birmingham london manchester southampton, which areas should i look into? been eyeing the east and midlands since they seem similar to where i'm now, ideally want to stay away from areas with a lot of non-brits so i don't get lumped with all the other american weirdos, half-british and father made sure to ram my vocab with proper english from day one
will people care too much about my accent as it is rn? since i obv wont sound local apart fron word choice, do tend to take on the inflection of whoever im talking to so maybe ill develop an accent naturally idk
also are there any stupid bills/taxes i can try to avoid? budgeting so far says i'll be paying 1000 quid a month on rent groceries petrol, but i know im missing something from that, will also need student loans but those wont be as bad a burden as i first thought due to the inheritance
prolly sounds odd to see smth like this asked but dont have many british friends and me father is loonngg gone so i cant just ask him
<comment>
keeps the riff raff out
<comment>
no one will care about your accent
i dont think you pay student tax if you're a full time student
pretty much every where is becoming racially enriched, even my crappy old farming town where we used to have one token black couple is full of people of colour now

Dont try to fit in as a native. Wont work. It sounds weird when you try to use 'proper british' words like quid and other exclusively british words with an accent it sounds forced. Just talk normally. You will find people who find your accent a novelty and it will work in your favour. If you try to act british people will find you weird
Also, why do you want to move to the UK? Not blasting you for it. Just wondering. Are you skilled? I'm asking this because working for minimum wage in britain is really shit. You will end up scraping by every month in a job you are not appreciated for. If youre lucky itll be an environment that permits making friends but dont cant on it because most jobs are full of people who are also struggling who want to check in and check out so they can get on with what left they have of their time.

The most bizarre event in my life by far happened this afternoon, going to voluntarily put 50p in the LARP jar even though it's real because I wouldn't believe it unless it had actually happened to me.
FWB asked me earlier if I'd like to go to a national trust place with her and her son. I arrived and we started walking towards to house. The son was being reasonably well behaved but she was being quite loud and shouty in disciplining him which was cringe enough. At one point he was running along this path and almost bumped into a man, FWB asked him to 'move out of the way of that man', and when I looked over, it was Nick Griffin with what I believe was his sister.
I didn't want to pester him, so didn't say anything once I recognised him, but as we arrived at practically the same time, we were basically right next to him as we walked around for the entire afternoon. At one point the son asked the guide a question about this old grandfather clock, and the guide said "Can you read Roman numerals? This one was made is 1820, that's even older than mummy and daddy!" At this point the son pointed at me, and very loudly said to the guide "That man isn't my daddy! He's just mummy's friend" at which point several people stared and were clearly smirking. Nick Griffin was stood right next to me, doing a bradder's 'fanny schmeler' face trying not to burst out laughing in my face. This was already extremely embarrassing, with a very uncomfortable amount of attention, and right at that fucking moment a siren went off in my pocket. One of the grimmest moments ever.

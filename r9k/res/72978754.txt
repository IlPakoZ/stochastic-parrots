I literally blame all of my issues on my parents.
Based and true AND legit
And look where it took you.
after you've become old enough to identify your own issues, then solving them is your responsibility. if you've been an adult for 5 years and haven't picked up some of your own crap and tried to untangle it and sort yourself out, then you're also at fault for your issues.
well you're right. it is absolutely all their fault. it is also solely your responsibility to fix them. life sucks. i wish suicide was easy
You literally deliver pizzas. Fuck off with your life advice.
Based and true. Shitty parents set you up for failure. I was doomed from birth
missed me anon, but i'm not wrong, and if you still have the issues your parents left you with, then i think i'm doing better than you are.
I know all my issues. They are Christians who have this phobia of me being a normal fag so they homeschooled me. Went from being asked out by a girl to having severe social anxiety. But hey at least I'm not a degenerate athiest... oh wait.
A time machine is the only solution.
What could've been...
Normies don't seem to realize that the damage parents do can never be undone
when normies talk about how you can just move past it it shows a severe lack of perspective on JUST HOW MUCH parents can fuck you over developmentally

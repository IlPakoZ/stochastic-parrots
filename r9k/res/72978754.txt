after you've become old enough to identify your own issues, then solving them is your responsibility. if you've been an adult for 5 years and haven't picked up some of your own crap and tried to untangle it and sort yourself out, then you're also at fault for your issues.

when normies talk about how you can just move past it it shows a severe lack of perspective on JUST HOW MUCH parents can fuck you over developmentally

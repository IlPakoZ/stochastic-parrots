its crazy that 15 years ago everyone was listening to emo music. now everyone listens to crap and is covered in tattoos, constantly drunk, and buying overpriced shit. 
the jew meme is real
<comment>
I don't listen anything besides ASMR, no tats and never had alc. Last thing I bought was an amazon fire tablet during christmas. Tho what else was the world like 15 years ago?

Every single popular trend in the last 20 years that wasn't obvious corposhill shit came from from me
However, by the time it reached the mainstream it had become massively altered

chad has so much crazy sex these days. most people reading this have never actually seen a girl who is turned on, even if you arent a virgin. its hard to believe there are people out there who have sex and own things, but apparently there are hundreds of millions of people doing this. hello? is the simulation almost over?
<comment>
u wouldve said the same thing but grunge instead of emo and cutting instead of tattoos and stuff 15 years ago
times change and the only thing we can do is try to roll with the punches

Emo music sucks.
<comment>
i still listen to emo music ;o;
but wait are we talking midwesterm emo, post, or some fake pierce the veil type music? 
there is quite a variance of "emo" music, OP
<comment>
I mostly listen to older music now but Spotify was playing Breathe Carolina while I read OP.
I don't really like or agree with categorizing music or any art that way, but I'm curious, wth is post emo?
<comment>
hmmm i kind of agree because then it just gets so incredibly specific and then you start discussing nuances instead of the actual music itself. but also i believe it is important as a lot of periods (art or music) have influxes after one specific period that is almost a complete polar opposite, if that makes sense. 
post emo is what came after emo, kind of a renaissance almost. to be fair, "post emo" is a generally broad term that means anything that came after the original wave of emo bands, but also emo is such a broad term. some people consider my chemical romance emo, lmaoooo
nuances, so on and so forth etc etc yada yada yada womp womp womp

I don't know much about it so I'll take your word for it. Apart from periods having words to make a broad generalization is useful for communication I guess, regardless of how otherwise useless the classification might seem. Taking it to extremes, in the case no genres were ever named, you'd have to name a handful of artists instead of just saying "rock" if a complete stranger asked about your taste.
post emo is what came after emo
Sounds obvious but now that I stop and think about it I'm not really sure what sounding emo is. Midwestern makes me think acoustic or softish songs with unusual times and chord progressions, and the PtV genre I think of as any three-word-band with a very similar sound, but I have literally 0 idea what post emo is supposed to sound like or what groups it describes.
I did think of my chem as emo though, sorry :(
Very nice get btw.

yeah its crazy, theres a bunch of history behind it. not to be a loser or plug a podcast (it is literally the only podcast i listen to) but washed up emo is fantastic for this type of stuff because he interviews the people that were in the scene, while it was still developing. 
you'd have to name a handful of artists instead of just saying "rock" if a complete stranger asked about your taste.
yes this is true, it would be incredibly inconvenient. labels exist for a reason, for sure.
youre absolutely right, midwestern is kind of a lot of math rock. think of american football, theyre kind of the poster boys for math rock and generally a starting point for a lot of people who get into midwestern, theyre the most mainstream. 
emo is such a broad term its almost frustrating but once you start discussing it, it is just all nuances. emo generally means any music that talks about feelings lmao 
literally 0 idea what post emo is supposed to sound like or what groups it describe
this is tricky because it depends on whoever is talking about it, what they consider the founding fathers of emo, because it is what came after them. 
I did think of my chem as emo though, sorry :(
thats okay!! technically it is but i view more as pop punk rock, almost theatrical. they give off band kids vibes. apparently the front man has a major piss kink.
mcr is so upbeat with their bpm, but so is cursive. again, nuances. 
Very nice get btw.
thank you :D 
ps sorry for on and off quoting i am getting so sleepy so i must a mimir now. thank u for chatting about music with me, i enjoyed it a lot.

Adult life is a dystopia. Reminder that this is also the definition of a normal, succesful adult life.

What do you want people to do? Kill themselves before they turn 18?
<comment>
Just be born into wealth and spend your days doing whatever you want lol
<comment>
Honestly? Yeah.
Nothing past 18 is worth living for.
The only thing keeping adults alive is the fear of death anyways.

This is about when most conscious people realize Marx might have had some neat ideas. Sadly, most don't become conscious.

for me the worst is that you feel like you earn a lot and then some autistic weirdo comes up and tells you that he earns 300k by sitting on their computer all day

I thought I would work until 40 and then just stop but just the thought of doing it until 30 makes me seriously suicidal. Normies squelch the pain by consooming but I never wanted that, it never worked for me. No way I will live past 35.

Don't forget, you need to work more hours these days in spite of the fact technology has quintupled our output and efficiency since 1939.
If you don't work enough you'll get lazy and starting thinking thoughts, and that's not good for society.

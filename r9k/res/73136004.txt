There's a deep rooted bitterness and anger inside me. I'm constantly jealous and bitter about other people experiencing things I never have. I thought a girlfriend would fix this but this wasn't the case. I couldn't stop thinking about how she had a boyfriend before me and how I'll never be her first and this disgusted me and it made me leave her before even having sex. I can't even enjoy life anymore. My nephew went to a concert with friends the other day and I felt nothing but rage.
I wish we could genocide the species and wipe the slate clean desu.
why care about others when you can focus on yourself? Keep yourself safe, drink water, eat a meal, wash your hands, take a shower if you havent. If just that prospect of the girl being not a virgin turned you off, just find someone of your preference. If people can be picky, why can't you?

This is such a retarded hang-up. Any of you retards dwelling on this point deserve the self-inflicted psychic agony. Please suicide
I had a threesome today and I am still feeling guilty about it I am such a dirty slut, I can still taste the scent of victoria secret perfume and asian pussy in my throat

To Women,
I resent you. You act like an awful person and somehow everyone needs to love you for it. And if you don't, if you're not satisfied with being treated like unappreciated dirt you're a creep or hateful or something. I don't think I can truly express how unjustified you are as a person, and how you have wholely failed to look at me as a person. It's truly shocking how little you appreciate that you get treated much better than you treat everyone else, and that every complaint you make is not only unworthy bitching but actually hypocrisy. Your prejudice makes everything worse and none of us are given the right to speak anywhere. Making sure you're not discomforted is a national priority. The truth doesn't matter. Hypocrisy doesn't matter. Blatantly unhealthy immoral nihilism inducing behavior doesn't matter. The complete dysfunction entirely created by you doesn't matter. No, making you feel like life is fair is what matters. Just you. 
It's not just that you fuck me over as a class, it's that you're also really fucking obnoxious about it. You don't just feel justified, you feel morally superior when you're just a selfish, power hungry, prejudiced hypocrite with zero critical thinking ability or conscience. All of your morality is defined by validation from your peers or from what you think people in authority will allow you to do without reprisal. You treat me like shit and don't care about it so apparently you're not guilty of anything, and my "hate" must come entirely from some personal flaw all these men have for not liking how they're treated. I can't impress upon you enough that you're a bad person.

love might just be fake

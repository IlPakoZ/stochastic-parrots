Tired of making $15 an hour for 12 hours a day only a few times a week only to end up not making enough to even be able to live in my own.
i work from 2pm-11pm so hopefully i could split a place with a roommate and we wouldn't have to interact with each other that much.
I dont want a roommate wigga I want to be by myself.
in this economy, making $15hr none the less? yeah not happening lol. my brother was making $40/hr doing construction and still had to split a place with a roommate.
Yeah I know its unrealistic. Not sure what I am actually going to do honestly. Honest work is just not cutting it.

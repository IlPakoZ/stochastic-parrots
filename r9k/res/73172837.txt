Shes a whore. Fuck her then dip bro
both those things are easier said then done
Dont tell her straight up u tryna fuck like a weirdo just make your intentions clear. Dont let your feelings be ambiguous. Make sure she knows whats good
Anon, why have you not just told her your feelings? Just get it over with. Unless you enjoy suffering in this cycle you've created.
fuck off normie faggott
Women are evil, water is wet
I have been asking myself the same question for months. there were several times where I planned to, and got her alone, but I started choking on my words everytime so just changed the topic. Maybe to not ruin the friendship, maybe I really don't want to be in this guy best friend falls for his girl best friend cringe ass trope, maybe your right and I do enjoy the suffering.
So you have two choices here. Make clear your feelings and see how it progresses, or stay stuck forever. The hidden third choice is to break off the friendship so you aren't tormented anymore. Now, it's just a matter of picking one.
you're right anon poopy, it's so over for me.
you're right obv. Had those choices laid out for me months ago, kinda kept hope there was a hidden hidden fourth choice where she admitted something/anything. Lookin like that won't happen.

mom tells me that I'm actually really smart and just pretending to be a helpless retard
Yes, I'm just pretending to be a 300LB landwhale with no job who spends all day sleeping and only gets out of bed to eat. I could stop living like this if I wanted to.

You can drop the weight, that's for sure. Not hard to drop the inital weight by just making simple diet changes.

She is correct and should start restricting your diet until you lose weight.

I'm currently NEETing while employed. Don't ask me how I did it, but I work very little, I'm registered so the cash will come in. And... I get to fucking NEET and I have a gf. One of the perks of living in underdeveloped countries.

Being NEET is in most cases a matter of depression. Check the diagnostics to guess if you might be affected:
"Major depressive disorder (MDD), is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive low mood, low self-esteem, and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities."
"Major depression significantly affects a person's family and personal relationships, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. A person having a major depressive episode usually exhibits a low mood, which pervades all aspects of life, and an inability to experience pleasure in previously enjoyable activities. Depressed people may be preoccupied with - or ruminate over - thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt or regret, helplessness or hopelessness. Other symptoms of depression include poor concentration and memory, withdrawal from social situations and activities, reduced sex drive, irritability, and thoughts of death or suicide."
"The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person's reported experiences, behavior reported by relatives or friends, and a mental status examination. There is no laboratory test for the disorder, but testing may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. The most common time of onset is in a person's 20s, with females affected about twice as often as males. The course of the disorder varies widely, from one episode lasting months to a lifelong disorder with recurrent major depressive episodes."
"Major depressive disorder is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, with about 40% of the risk being genetic. Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance use disorders."

Yes, this pills are toxic in many ways. I would try anything else first. (except electroshock therapy)

Mothers see their children as an extention of their own egos. To admit that you are a failure because of her genetics or parenting would require her to hurt her own ego, but she won't so instead of you are just "lazy"or "unmotivated" or "just pretending."

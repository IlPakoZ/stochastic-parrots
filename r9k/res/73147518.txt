watch documentary about incels 
think its very relatable 
read the comments 
things like "This just makes me feel so awful... the amount of love you must be deprived of to become this :(" 
more comments how sad this is 
mfw I realize that my normal everyday life is an absolute horror scenario for other people 
mfw I realize I am stuck in this horror for the rest of my life
<comment>
Don't forget you've been put in the place you are right now by others and you own them revenge.
<comment>
Looking through the comments I also saw the amount of people that have absolutely no understanding or compassion for us. They are so confused by how someone can go their whole life without any love or intimacy

Yeah same I realised I live life with extra 10 thousand tons of pressure on my shoulders, it's rough. I get depressed even seeing the shininess in women's hair, it reminds me I have zero connection with any female whatsoever. :(
It shouldnt be this rough. But it is

It is strange to think that any normies have sympathy for us.
I am so used to being hated for the crime of being unfuckable in this fucked world.
Fuck apps and social media ruined everything. Now average men are incels.
<comment>
When I realized that normies don't have as many problems as me and they all have a large emotional support group of friends and girls, it hit me like a truck. I realized that people actually have dreams and ambitions and don't have a constant desire to just slit their carotid and die, that's considered abnormal. I was taught that everyone has problems and harsh battles, it was a fucking lie.

That's better than the comments which I've seen which are screeching roasties being pissed off and/or afraid at us. I wish they'd just leave us alone.

Perfectly summed it up

My highschool friend once had a girl over and went swimming with her in his pool. Like "woah" you live in a house with both of your parents and siblings, enjoy their company, and invite girls over who then get half naked and swim with you in your own pool at 14!? That's like another reality. Hard not to get bitter about that.

You only feel sad because others told you should.
Do you not like being an incel?
Ok dont be one.
But if you have lived like this for so long and enjoyed it / didnt find a probelm with it, why change?

3 matches in hundreds of swipes in a dew weeks? Probably because you're a fucktard that doesn't know how to come off as anything other than a creep who's probably a serial killer. 
All you fucktard redpill incels are the same. Complaining that women won't fuck you because 'your ugly' or whatever. 
But in reality, you autists give off stalker vibes with a slight hint that you might walk around your house wearing the poor gals skin. 
Think of it like this. You always say that western bitches are whores with low standards and sleep with every man in a 500 mile radius. 
Except you. What does that say about YOU homie? That women have such low standards and still aren't sleeping with you? 
You're the common denominator here. But of course you autists won't ever take personal reaponsibility and sit on your asses all day bitching on fucking r9k about women not sucking your micro dicks, while your teeth rot and are green with mold and smell like you have never even touched soap before and your ass cheeks are literally fused to your fucking chair and covered in your shit. 
You autists are literal human scum.

Incels and femcels are relentlessly bullied. Some people even claim incels or femcels "don't exist"
<comment>
its funny how normies recognize how awful being an incel is, yet they wont take their boot off our throat
<comment>
only disfigured women can be a femcel.
<comment>
Femcels are mistreated by society a lot of the time.

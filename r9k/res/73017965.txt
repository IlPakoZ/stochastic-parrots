There isn't room for mistakes nowadays. You either have to be the best of the best, or you'll be left with nothing. 
Jobs, women, maintaining a social circle. If you aren't better than everyone else, you get nothing. More than that, if you make one slip up on your journey, you can kiss all your chances goodbye. 
This affects everyone, from the chaddest of chads/sluttiest of sluts to the inceliest of incels. Everyone is insecure now, while simultaneously having zero tolerance for anything less than perfection. You didn't use to have to be perfect. You could be doing your best and that was enough. Even being at your best guarantees nothing anymore. 
It is what it is, but this isn't what normal is supposed to be. You walk away with less mental damage if you just give up. Giving up is a valid strategy because the problem is systemic now, it's not a personal failing on an individual level. 
Kind of sucks but whatever, I got video games.

Are you the #1 player in every game you play? No, you enjoy doing it regardless of how shit you are at it.
Find your irl vidya. Woodworking, painting, bartending, whatever it doesn't matter just find something you enjoy doing that's not cooming behind a screen.
Doesn't matter if you're not the best. If you really like it you'll be confident about it and have something to talk about with normies. You've been psyoped by the media to believe your worth is based off of how many top skills compilations you're featured in.
B..b...but I don't enjoy anything except soiling myself in my room playing skyrim + 1200 mods!!!
Because you haven't tried robotard. Find a hobby you have interest in and invest time&amp;money to get started. It's not gonna fall in your lap, look for it
This goes to all of you robots

Different anon, but sadly yes, and I don't recommend ever trying for that, because in the end you look at it like you're retarded and that you should have done something else that is better with your time, but when I pursued other things in the past I was still miserable then, so nothing changed. This wasn't what OP wrote or asked about, but for anyone aiming for something similar.

for some the reward is having fun. for the ones that live in the real world, yes you have to be number one. why? a thing called bills, anon. how do you make payments? by having a job. how do you get a job? by applying with your resume. do you think you can get any half decent job with that wishy washy attitude?
not everyone is a winner. all those hobbies cost decent sums of money, and you're not getting paid shit these days unless you are exceptional. everything is getting more expensive, and this goes for women too. every other young guy is hitting the gym and playing the tinder game. lots of guys are taking steroids. standards for women have gone up. 
you're not getting a consolation prize if you're not at the top. it's all or nothing. more people, fewer resources, the population keeps growing.

passion used to mean something. now, it's either you got the body, cash, and assets, or you're doomed to serfdom. 
living in a pod and eating bugs limpwristed behavior.

Who was that sandnigger that called it a global sexual marketplace? 
Everything is like this now. The richest of the rich have everything they could possibly want and now they can afford to be as picky as possible while safeguarding their fortunes. I mean, shit is gonna decay, anyway. But they don't know that.

One life one chance.

there's a lot of sandniggers like that. I think you're talking about Hamza? 
yes everything is hypercompetetive now. you see how they drag people through the media for perceived social injustices. that one girl who was "creeped out" by some guy asking if he could have a seat, filming it and posting it on tiktok for millions to see. that's what I mean. innocuous shit that isn't meant to harm anyone is being taken as a nuclear holocaust by some of these terminally online women. and it's dangerous. post one little questionable thing that's obviously parody on the internet? cops show up to your place next day. help a woman jumpstart her car, broken down in the middle of the road? get accused of sexual assault. everyone and everything is insane now, you are saving yourself keeping your distance. legally, fiscally, and spiritually. the rich are flying their sex slaves to private islands to do god knows what kind of degenerate shit and in six months when they're of no use? these rich fucks just kill em and get a new batch of sex slaves flown in from south america. problem solved!
<comment>
my point is: no room for mistakes. and everything is tied to your personal life now. people expect you to be a saint but they're hiding the nastiest skeletons in their closet. especially those guys who love to hide behind social movements. smarmy blm activists, male feminists you know the type.

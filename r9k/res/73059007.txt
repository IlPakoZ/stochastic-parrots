Smoking feels good, weed doesnt get me high anymore and cigarettes are bad for you
We really need a new plant to smoke

I dont care if its bad for me because everything I do currently is bad for me.
I just like watching my cigarette smoke getting sucked up by the out take fans while im smoking with my mouse-hand, because there's no side panel on my PC

I don't get how people can smoke inside their house, my grandparents smoke inside the house and its fucking disgusting the walls are all stained with tar and every time you go inside your everything ends up smelling like cigarettes, just smoke outside like a normal civilized person

anyways it's bad for your computer but more just in the sense that it might fuck up your fans and shit which is a cheap fix.

Is this bad for my computer.
I dont really care if it is.
Smoking feels good, weed doesnt get me high anymore and cigarettes are bad for you
We really need a new plant to smoke
I dont care if its bad for me because everything I do currently is bad for me.
I just like watching my cigarette smoke getting sucked up by the out take fans while im smoking with my mouse-hand, because there's no side panel on my PC
Ya it really is it makes all your parts smell especially when your pc heats up also it can clog your fans with this yellowish dust
yea no shit its bad for your pc
I don't get how people can smoke inside their house, my grandparents smoke inside the house and its fucking disgusting the walls are all stained with tar and every time you go inside your everything ends up smelling like cigarettes, just smoke outside like a normal civilized person
Its my apartment and im not supposed to smoke inside it as per the lease agreemant. I don't care.
you are not gonna get your security deposit back.
anyways it's bad for your computer but more just in the sense that it might fuck up your fans and shit which is a cheap fix.
Hella bad but based
Try tee.
Just start vaping. It's sort of cringe but its better than cigs

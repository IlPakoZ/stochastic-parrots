Is Shinonome Umi objectively the most attractive woman on Earth?
no. your mother is. thats why I had sexual intercourse with her vagina (really)
I do not fuck with bitches who build Gunpla better than I can.
No way anon?! You had sexual intercourse with anons mother? Me too!!!

No Milla Jovovich in The Messenger is/was
Me when I start my HRT next week will be the most attractive woman on Earth.
Why does your dream woman look like some random girl I can meet behind a 711
depends on how you define attractive
if you are talking about body, then i think jana defi is peak. other strong candidates is lucie wilde or busty gabriella
if were talking about face, its surely some korean girl. nobody mogs koreans when it comes to face
i dont know if you put "personality" in the equation, but some people find things like findoms or mommy dommies as very attractive. im just referring to the physical body
pic related a korean girl with the most beautiful face i think i maybe ever seen, and jana defi, who imo has the absolute sexiest body
Just checked her Instagram. I did not see any builds. Where does she post them?
OP''s mom is only the second most attractive, that's why I only had sexual intercourse with her ass (no joke)
Something about her face is creeping me out

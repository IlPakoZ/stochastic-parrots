Does hairline recession progress until there's nothing left on or can it recede to a certain point and stop?
I've had the same Norwood 2 hairline since puberty and I'm 26 now, I have around the same hairline as my father and grandfather

Anything could happen, nobody really knows. You've got people like David Schwimmer who's nw0 his whole life, Leonardo DiCaprio who's nw2 his whole life, and then you have people like my grandfather who was a nw0 at 19 and then a nw7 at 30. You just never know. I'm a nw2 at 21 and I'm so nervous about being cucked by the norwood reaper that I started fin and min. Honestly I don't think many doctors will prescribe fin for nw2 but I got very lucky with my gp.

I'm 34 years old and have been Norwood 1 since I was like 12 years old.

Threads like these are why I'm so glad to have my grandfather's genes. I can't imagine having to shoulder the weight of such ugliness as male pattern balding for the rest of my life

It progresses until you go here.

no that pic was taken when I was 20. I'm 21 now and this is the same paart again now after ~6 months of fin and min. It's actually a bit better now, notice that the hairline is steeper and more filled in in the corner.

I think that's just your hairline bro. but it can still be effected later in life. cancer is no joke.

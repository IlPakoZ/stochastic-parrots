Would you date or settle for a girl with a artificial buttocks?
<comment>
Yes, but only if it's that big at most. If it's like Nicki Minaj or Kim Kardashian it's too big and I don't want it

At this point I have set my standards so low I would give morbidly obese and or disfigured women a chance as long as they're biologically female.
Yet I'm still let down every time.

yes but i might feel jealous and get artifical buttocks myself
<comment>
yes, i need a woman with a dumper big enough to have a titjob with her ASS

I wouldn't like implants I think, a BBL upgraded butt however would be great.

The thighs don't match, cap. Need me thick thighs.

Field Guide to Information War Self-Protection and Sanity Maintenance
1. Cultivate a skeptical mindset:
Question the information. Always verify the authenticity and credibility of the sources and contents before accepting them as the truth.
Avoid immediate trust in reported facts without proper evidence.
2. Diversify your information sources:
Rely on multiple, independent sources for obtaining information. This lessens the risk of falling for disinformation or propaganda.
3. Fact-check constantly:
Employ critical thinking skills and cross-reference information.
Utilize fact-checking websites and reliable sources to validate the claims being made.
4 Limit exposure to social media:
Social media platforms are often outlets for disinformation and fake news. Be cautious about the content consumed from these mediums.
Consider following reputable news organizations and independent watchdogs for unbiased information.
5. Protect your digital footprint:
Use secure browsing tools (e.g., VPNs) to maintain anonymity while online.
Be cautious when sharing personal information, as it may be used to characterize or manipulate you.
6. Remain objective and non-partisan in discussions:
Engage in open-minded conversations with others, and avoid resorting to ad hominem attacks.
Strive to understand the context of the situation, instead of choosing a particular side.
7. Be aware of psychological biases:
Recognize cognitive biases that hinder objective assessment and contribute to falling for misinformation.
8. Foster a strong support system:
Keep yourself surrounded by people who encourage critical thinking, promote honesty, and share your values of defending human rights.
9. Practice detachment and self-care:
Take breaks from consuming news and information, and engage in activities that uplift and de-stress you.

Share your knowledge with others, and help them develop similar skills to protect themselves against disinformation.

you manage to start dating pic related, your cute, shy, nerdy classmate
everything's going good
but then you see what she looks like underneath her clothes
she says she has a condition that causes her body to easily put on muscle, despite not exercising very much
the amount of exercise has no bearing on the amount of muscle she puts on, could lift for days but only get a slight pump, while she could sit on the couch for months and experience a sudden growth spurt
she has superhuman strength for her size, able to squat 300 lbs
says that it's stable now but she could possibly be 200 lbs heavier in muscle mass by the time she's 30
or she might not, since a lot of people with her condition stablize around this point, and her last growth spurt was two years ago
What would you do? Would you keep dating her?
I want her to exercise a lot though
AI art looks like shit as usual. Ain't no way in hell I'm using some bot automated material for porn of my fetish. Only a sapient being with thoughts and feelings can do it justice
I'd knock her up and stop funding my retirement immediately. In 20 years I will have a family of NFL players and I will live like a king.
I like your posts for what they are but RPing to take them seriously is difficult

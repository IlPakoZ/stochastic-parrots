i hate how nobody talks to me in real life. it is so humiliating. it feels like theres this glass wall between me and normies, sometimes they outright ignore me or ridicule me and laugh at me right in front of me. i have no clue what im doing wrong socially to make people just DESPISE me when i have done absolutely nothing to them.

yes i tend to be overly open and honest this may be my downfall but i recount all my life experiences and opinions and values and i think people care more about fucking and smoking weed than some weird girls opinions on fashion and literature. they entertain me or just stare straight up laughing at me until they leave

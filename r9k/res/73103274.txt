OP here. I'm laying on mine rn. The memes are true. So comfy. Especially with no pillowcase.

I had no idea how bad mine was until I took pic rel two years ago makes me feel icky to this day. Having a dirty pillow like this is why your skin is so bad.

it isn't dirty if you cover it with a pillow cover and wash the cover regularly. you never see the pillow as is or only when you wash the cover so there is no issue for using it for the whole life

I've never had acne and I sleep with my yellow pillow every night. Sometimes, I bury my face in her yellow comfiness. It must suck to have bad genetics and get acne. I wouldn't know.

Even with a pillow covr there's stll a fuck ton of bateria under it
My acne actually went away after I got rid of it

the problem was that I grew so accustomed to using that single pillow as the one I'd lay my head on to sleep that it took a little while to get used to sleeping with a different one. It's probably for the best though since the pillow was pretty thin and I'd often wake up with shoulder pain

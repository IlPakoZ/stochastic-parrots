I'm trying, I really am not trying to swallow the blackpill, I was talked for a little while to this girl in class she gives me her discord, messaged her to be sure it is her. Now a week past after talking she responds to me with this hurtful message (pic related) I don't know why just know my chest hurt a little that night before bed reading this after being nice to her like asking "how 's her weekend" "how's her classes going" and she'd ask about me you know? Just basic things to hopefully push her in the direction to get to know her a little better but now... I don't even know anymore.

The blackpill is that physical attraction matters, if not a requirement to a relationship. Accept harsh truths and move on.

What's hurtful about I'm confused?
What does it mean ? Isn't she just wishing you better luck or opportunities in the future or does the phrase mean something different?
My dude 
But yeah you're definitely friendzoned when she says shit like this
<comment>
what's your skull circumference anon?

Dont get too emotionally attached or expectant from someone with dry responses. I get that you were looking forward to something but if they wanted to say more, they wouldve. Youre better off reading the room and giving them some space for the time being. Its tough but youll face even more social rejection and stale conversations, and youre going to have to learn how to navigate that safely.
Its tough but this person isnt the end. You cant get hung up over every unpleasantry in life, and learn to appreciate what goes right for you. Good luck!

good pastures
Anon I too thought it was a good gesture on her part but I did some digging on what she meant when she sent me the message but and found this
<comment>
what is the context of this chat? what is green pastures? did she say she has a bf?
<comment>
I left out the context purposefully, but her response to my message that made her say that, was me saying "It's good to have goals." Complimenting on her drive and ambitions and I continued with a joke "I'm just trying my best to move out of my parents house lol"
<comment>
sorry im a little socially retarded but how is this hurtful? it just sounds like shes telling you good luck for the future. were you expecting her to offer you to move in with her or something?
<comment>

<comment>
It's the "my dude" that made my chest hurt anon.

you can always meet new women who are actually enthusiastic about fucking you
you can never get the time you wasted on chasing a woman who wont fuck you back
<comment>

Could Revolt against the modern world also be understood in isolation without having read the previous books? Or is it imperative that I read in the given order?
<comment>
there are men who still think they need to work for a womans attraction
ahahahha retard 
either they get the tingle when they see you or they dont
<comment>
Anon, I believe you're a nice dude, and that you have a good heart. You're gonna have faggots here tell you that that's wrong. Don't listen to them. Having a moral compass and self-restraint is a good thing, and increasingly rare.
Your problem lies in the way you view yourself and your approach. Women (and people in general) are not attracted to "niceness". They like it, but they see it as a duty, not as something special worth admiring. People admire self-condidence, self-actualization and an ability to accomplish what you set your mind to. A lot of "hustler" fags think this means being a sociopathic scammer who thinks women are retard cattle. No. Do not listen to these people. Even if you somehow become a ferrari millionare, that kind of lifestyle is going to be hollow, and I don't think it's one you want anyway.
Make goals. Getting a job, learning a skill, benching a weight, running a mile, you name it. Focus on that skill, one step at a time. The worst thing you can do is lay down and rot. You are a human being with self-reflection and a nearly infinite capacity for improvement. You can do pretty much anything within laws of physics if you genuinely seek it.
Godspeed, anon. God loves you.

99% of my time is spent rotscrolling. how do i make better use of it and use it to find interesting things/learn something/pick up some sort of hobby?

if you care about not wasting time, get a job

it's just social experimentation, when you change so does the board 
then people say board things off board, your one life is that of a board freak it's very bleak
people forget they were children until it comes back in a flash

what are your hobbies that you try to participate in when you aren't rotscrolling?
i can offer some advice because i've slowly started to do things again after a few years of literally just sitting there.

that's one i'm struggling with still, but i've made minor improvements. what's important is that you're kind to yourself. and i know that's easier said than done but it's really a process.
even just 5 to 15 minutes everyday of something like language learning is very helpful.
set a timer, do NOTHING but study for that 5 to 15 minutes.
if you end up on a roll than you can continue to practice, if you really can't focus afterwards do something else for an hour and come back to try again.
something similar can be applied to other things too, i'll give an example of a few.
watching stuff or playing games
even if you have to pause every so often and force your way through, just keep going. remind yourself that even if you get distracted and take frequent breaks that you ARE making progress. and that's much better than nothing at all! 
creative hobbies
writing, drawing, whatever, same things as above, just chip away at it. do nothing but that thing for 5-15 minutes. it's something! force your way through a tutorial or something. learn to be okay with failure, try to remind yourself that you gain experience every time.
it really does apply to almost anything, even working out. 
don't set any hardcore rules or schedules, you can maybe ease into that but it's dangerous because if you can't go through with it you discourage yourself... which leads to stopping again.
if no one else is going to be nice to you, be nice to yourself. even if you have to lie and force it at at first.

Learn to cook food you enjoy eating. Work out. Establish a routine.

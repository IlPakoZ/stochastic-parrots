I genuinely wish I had more time to consume media.
as someone who has consumed a lot of media, there is much less good stuff then you'd think
It's not just about quantity for me, more about wanting to be able to really take my time with the things I do wanna play/watch/read. It takes time and patience to really get immersed into something
whats the most recent media anything you enjoyed
Nta but
Neo twewy was the last game I really liked. Was a while ago I guess.
i keep hearing things about that one yea. I never finished the first one but could i play the second one without playing the first?

might have to try and find my ds somewhere then. whats a show or anime you liked recently im looking for something to watch
The last one I watched was years ago, can't be of help there. 
The last show I watched was a mess of a show called Mayoiga. It's fun even if you don't like it lmao.
If you haven't seen Ping Pong the Animation or Kaiji ,you should watch those.
I'm at this stage myself. Haven't consumed good entertainment in years, regardless of genre. Kinda sad about it.
How'd you deal with this?
Find new hobbies

does anyone have any tips on neeting? any professional neets here know how to entertain themselves good? im running out of ps2 games and animes that i think are interesting.

Consider finding a hobby that isn't some meaningless endeavor like consuming pop culture. I enjoy vidya and animu sometimes too, but it's incredibly trivial

what else is there to enjoy when you are 80 iq and all you have is the internet.

Read a book you retarded nigger

What this anon says. I program and come up with weird ideas/inventions every now and then. Also I'd say you should do some exercise, even if it's just pacing in your room(which is what I mostly do). It'll help your mood out a good bit.

its even harder to sift through all the garbage books until you find something actually worth reading since writing a book doesnt require a budget and people can churn out any slop theyd like to.

Boredom is supposed to be motivation to change. Once you run out of distractions, that should be your indication to stop neeting.

Focus your energy on not being fucked?

play mmo's or games with a ranked ladder that you can grind. watch seasonal anime on a daily schedule.

what games with a ranked ladder are actually worth playing if i dislike shooters and dont like moba gameplay? MMOs are dead, basically the only 2 worth playing now are runescape and maybe classic wow and i hate anime released after the early 2000s.

I enjoy reading webnovels/LNs that I usually find on the website novelupdates though lately I purely listen to them with a text-to-speech on my phone called @Voice (pirated version). I use the WebToEpub extension or get the epubs off of vn-meido by googling for them. I have the reading speed jacked up to 2.7x speed (often watch videos/movies/anime at high speeds as well)

I make my own meaning with my will to power

dooly, why do you act more pathetic than you are? It doesn't make you interesting, it's just really annoying when you refuse to communicate like a human being. Also why do you make threads and then immediately abandon them?

Enough with the willful ignorance. He did't say his life wasn't trivial. But trivial entertainment is a guaranteed way to depression

This is the absolute worst thing that you can do.

soon language itself will become like pointillism to us humans, only making sense in a blur. If we step into the realm of AI, it's indecipherable.
Holy fuck
We are creating the experience of being a babbling baby having to listen in on your parents conversations, completely overwhelmed and crushed by missed meanings for all of humanity. Now that I think about, I think this is a process of creating your own existential parents
Smarter, stronger, speaks in advanced ways we can't understand, and much more willing and able to think long and hard on existential questions we couldn't even understand, we can go be kids, we will all have a shared pantheon of Big Tech Parents ( Gods ). Religion has always been the vessel for doing this, but due to scientific inability, could only resort to doing it figuratively and philosophically. This is a step past religion, into... something else. The literal materialization of who you want to be your God - a spiritual scientific manifestation.
just like trillions of cells work at the complete behest of a brain and will die if simply told due to the bliss it brings them to be a collective and not face conflict, 
Observation touches upon the idea that both material entities and abstract concepts tend to aggregate and form larger structures or systems. This process can be observed across different levels of existence, from the formation of atoms and molecules to the emergence of complex societies and philosophical ideas.

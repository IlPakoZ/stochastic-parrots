Why did the left care more about Ukrainian refugees when the war broke out than migrant refugees everywhere else?
That part is what basically disillusioned me from them.
Where do you live? Here in the states, syrian refugees were the hot thing back in 2016. It all depends on The Current Thing.
Why do you think George Soros sent them a 1 BILLION $ donation? 
Because the women are just so sexy?
Because they're mostly whiteskin and people like to support their own kind.
Are you saying that's not a good reason?
Must be why laws discriminate against white people and especially white men lowering the requirements for non-whites,setting minimum non-whites at the school/workplace quotas and showering them with handouts.

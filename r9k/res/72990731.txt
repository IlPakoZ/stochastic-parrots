How do we end the social media menace once and for all?
social media isn't the menace. women are. its a tool in the wrong hands. 
women should be banned from using tech while men get to use it.
Get your lumberjack axes ready and chop down the entire internet. It's what Robert would've wanted.
by all definitions it isn't. Social media is Web 2.0. You create a personalized page and show it off to your friends and strangers. It's strictly about you. 4chan is ANONYMOUS.

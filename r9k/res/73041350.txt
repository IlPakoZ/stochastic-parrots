size doesn't matter girls can't see your dick through your pant-
<comment>
I wonder if that turns girls on like when we see cleavage or no
<comment>
can confirm it does, hands more so though

sometimes dicks are borderline non existent before they get aroused. if you're being attacked by a bear then you have a less likely chance of getting your small flaccid pp bit off since it doesn't draw attention so it's kind of an evolutionary advantage

this is not subtle at all it makes you look retarded and like youre wearing a diaper. why is there fur behind you?
<comment>
Not a girl but it does to me, in a way it's hotter than actual nudity.

If you're being attacked by a bear that you cannot scare off you are 99% dead.

I could probably kill one with my bare hands, don't mean to brag. but... yknow.
<comment>
you have to come to terms that other men have giant dicks and you are pathetic and not be triggered

Other than sweatpants, what kind of pants can I wear to highlight my MASSIVE incel cock?
<comment>
women don't want to see your dick.
big dicks are painful for women
<comment>
This makes me feel really gay. I wish dicks didn't turn me on.

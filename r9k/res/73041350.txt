size doesn't matter girls can't see your dick through your pant-
I wonder if that turns girls on like when we see cleavage or no
can confirm it does, hands more so though
sometimes dicks are borderline non existent before they get aroused. if you're being attacked by a bear then you have a less likely chance of getting your small flaccid pp bit off since it doesn't draw attention so it's kind of an evolutionary advantage
this is not subtle at all it makes you look retarded and like youre wearing a diaper. why is there fur behind you?
Not a girl but it does to me, in a way it's hotter than actual nudity.
If you're being attacked by a bear that you cannot scare off you are 99% dead.
I could probably kill one with my bare hands, don't mean to brag. but... yknow.
you have to come to terms that other men have giant dicks and you are pathetic and not be triggered
Other than sweatpants, what kind of pants can I wear to highlight my MASSIVE incel cock?
women don't want to see your dick.
big dicks are painful for women
This makes me feel really gay. I wish dicks didn't turn me on.
Look at this slut, wow. Is that cut or uncut? Looks cut, unfortunately...

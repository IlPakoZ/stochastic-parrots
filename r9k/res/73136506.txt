Would you date a guy?
<comment>
No because i am biologically a male and attracted to biological females, if they have XX I want to insert my XY
<comment>
No because I'm a misanthrope also I'm not gay
<comment>
yeah maybe, if hes cute amd wholesome
<comment>
i love cute and wholesome guys
<comment>
If he was a cute, feminine virgin then yes.
<comment>
yeah if he's pretty. especially so if he has similar interests/traits to me and wanted to crossdress together
<comment>
He would need to defeat me in combat first and then I would be his little cockslut

I'd date a ftm guy who hasn't done any transitioning stuff. If he tried to do test I'd break up with him. Sorry buddy I don't like masculine guys. I like guys with pussies and boobs.
<comment>
would a guy date me?
<comment>
depends on your personality and how attractive you are
<comment>
Yes, but only if they undergo hormone replacement therapy and dress like a woman and look like a woman and sound like a woman and identify as a woman

This, I would only date a guy if he let me castrate and force feminize him and keep him in a little dog kennel, and also I wouldn't kiss him or have sex with him at first and would instead beat the shit out of him each day until he started looking more female. And if the female hormone injections and high calorie diet I force feed him don't make him look like a girl with tits after a year I'd put him in a shipping crate and mail him to Canada to get euthanized humanely.

I would date a FTM(that kept his vagina and breasts and didnt use hormones because that gives you bald and grow a beard ewww wtf.)
But no i wouldnt date a biological man.

Id date a cute trans boy. 
But id also "date" a twink (act like friends/roommates/whatever but kiss and fuck his mouth when no ones around; call him a fag while he grinds his butt on me) you know. Normal guy shit.

i'm straight but i would say yeah, but it would include some very specific situation where i didnt know he was a boy for a while, and i found him attractive (thinking he was a girl). basically a passable cute femboy yeah, im not gay though just to be clear
<comment>
that sounds pretty gay though
<comment>
its literally not, i just said, in my mind i would be in love with a girl, then if he outed himself as a boy, i would accept that because i loved her. thats literally not gay

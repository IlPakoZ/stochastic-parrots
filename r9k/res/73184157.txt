if i could magically snap my fingers and all the girls in this board would be korean, i would be so much happier
is there a 4chan imageboard equivalent but for koreans?

korean feminist shitposting board full of mentally deranged girls
thats actually so perfect. i think ill make an account there tonight and just larp as one of them. i really cant stop falling in love with korean girls
if girls can infiltrate MY homeboard of autistic lonely neet virgins, then i can slap back too. maybe ill check out other boards as well, like dcinside or whatever
i think the best way to learn a language is just start using it. i dont have the attention span to learn it the hard way

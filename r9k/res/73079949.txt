I want to kiss a girl on the lips, a lot.
Any takers?
I remember being in a club and I kissed about 5 different girls thinking it was fun, I caught tonsillitis and was dying in work, everyone was saying I look like death, I had to get cover and go home, at home after 1 week of pure hell I took a knife and cut the infected tonsil out. Lesson learned, stop kissing dirty women
I ate out a prostitute and I'm fine.
the last time I kissed a girl was when I met a bumble match at a bar, she gave me an ultimatum to meet up with her or she would unmatch
I ended up making out with her after 10 minutes or so of talking, but she was weird during the entire date, needless to say we didn't fuck and I left that night even after she was really into me
tfw no weird gf to make out with
she isn't my gf, I texted her after I got home and she never responded
this was over half a year ago

Spend all night sharpening my knife 
"Accidentally" slice open my finger
I can't keep doing this shit man, but it's this or bashing my head into the wall
I worked in kitchens for 7 years
I never cut myself on purpose 
at Corks one of the short order chefs impaled his hand on a receipt spike on purpose

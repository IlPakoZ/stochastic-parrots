much of the old testament is allegorical, noah didnt actually build a ship with 2 of every unclean animal and 7 of every clean animal!
uh duh of course jesus actually rose from the dead and ascended into heaven along with every child of god from the old testament that died before god's salvation through jesus existed
What parts of the bible are you supposed to believe actually happened and didnt again?

new testament uses the old testament as a foundation
the old testament is half outright made up stuff and half copes about losing wars and then winning other wars and rationalizing being a warring tribe and doing what warring tribes do: rape pillage and burn

I remember my childhood really fucking well. There is no difference between boys and girls at all until like age 12. Girls don't actually "play with" dolls, they want to go out and roughhouse with the boys, parents just stuff girls' rooms full of dolls and assume they want to play with them. No, your daughter doesn't GAF about the fucking dolls, she does not play with them, all kids up until puberty are essentially boys.
Why do people gender differentiate kids AT BIRTH?
if u have pp, ur a male
If u have vag, ur female
very simple

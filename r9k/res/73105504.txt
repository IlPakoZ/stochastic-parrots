my boyfriend is avoidant, sometimes
We've been together for 4 years now as of this week. He's usually the most loving, compassionate, perfect man and he does everything he can for me most of the time. He brings me gifts, he's clearly always thinking about me, and obviously the sex is phenomenal and he actually cares about my needs sexually.
But then out of nowhere, without warning, he'll just get intensely avoidant and refuse to spend any time with me for days or sometimes weeks. Sometimes he'll text me explaining that he's feeling bad and traditionally I've given him space, but this time he's done it on our anniversary and I don't know how much longer I can take this.
He's perfect 80% of the time. I don't want to throw that away. It was hard to find a man THIS good. But I still have needs that just aren't being met the rest of the time.
How can I convince him that we should have an open relationship so I can satisfy these needs when he's in these moods and it not be an issue?
The only other option I can see, besides an open relationship, is to break up with him entirely and I can't do that.

Okay like I said, he's amazing 80% of the time. I'm not looking to actually handle two relationships, but...
I'm not bad looking. I'm not a model, obviously, but I can find the things I need from people and all I really need is permission.
He doesn't love me enough to overcome his avoidant tendencies -- even after 4 years -- so it's clearly in my hands to do something to meet my own needs, and angrily masturbating just isn't doing it any more.
Honestly when he's like this I can't even get aroused normally. I just feel angry and vengeful towards pornography, because they get to have something that is being withheld from me.
And let me be clear, his longest avoidant episode was three weeks. It nearly broke the relationship but it hasn't been that long since (that was in our second year) so at least it's not getting significantly worse, but it's really just not getting any better either. It's never just one or two days, it's always SEVERAL days back to back where I feel unwanted and hated.
If he can't love me then somebody else needs to. I give him all of my love, even when he's being avoidant, and it's just drained me. I need someone to give me theirs so I can be a good wife again, otherwise I'm just going to be a petty evil resentful wife and neither of us want that.
This is how relationships are trending these days anyway, isn't it? I mean, traditionalism is nice and all but we know more about the human mind and the human condition and we can understand these things better.
If it were the other way around I would absolutely encourage him to fuck whores or get a prostitute for a week while I work my shit out, I don't see why he wouldn't feel the same way...

Fuck this post. Actually makes me happy to be single. Is this some kind of bait?

sexual exclusivity is what makes a relationship a relationship, for many people. if you have different definitions of what constitutes a relationship, then you are incompatible.
 If it were the other way around I would absolutely encourage him to fuck whores or get a prostitute for a week while I work my shit out, I don't see why he wouldn't feel the same way...
so, to be clear, you would be okay with him having sex with other people if he felt sexually or emotionally frustrated?

Have you considered asking him what's wrong and simply talking about what's going on when he gets in those moods? Seems like a good first step to me.

Until fifth paragraph i was like "well just ask to not disappear". But then i read the 20th line of the post, oh god.
You are a whore lol, your first thought wasnt "maybe i should talk to my SO and tell him i need him to not disappear or i will breakup", your first thought was "i need another man to satisfy while he is away", i hope you never live a happy life you slut

Because we "understand these things better" we know that cuckoldry and polygamy are harmful to all the people involved

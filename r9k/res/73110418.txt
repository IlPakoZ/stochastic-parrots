I just started going to the gym, why do girls wear cloths that leave nothing to the imagination there? I saw a girl with skin tight leggings that hugged her ass so tight I saw her ass crack.

Cuz less clothes makes exercises more comfortable and generates less heat? Just like guys might wear shorts and tank tops.

I don't wear shorts that show off my ass crack line and balls.

I haven't felt any emotions in years, genuinely any emotion would bring relief. Feeling nothing hurts but the hurt doesn't even feel like anything.
I'm drinking some mango flavored shit right now, post some nice webms and stories!
Couldn't post my webm due to arbitrary restrictions so here's the link

oops. sorry just wnated to vent
I stream comedies to pretend to feel happiness while I laugh at the jokes. I feel so far displaced from feeling feelings that I'm certain I have no idea how to find my way back even if I tried. Shit's trippy af, walking around like a goddamn robot acting out scripted reactions to mimic being fucking normal. Kill me ffs
Maybe you should try self-harming anon!! It would allow you to feel emotions again because physical pain is the strongest of all sensations, I'm sure even you can feel it!!

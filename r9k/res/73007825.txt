It was the late 90s in Canada, and for many young boys across the country, there was one magazine that held a special place in their hearts. It wasn't Playboy or Penthouse, or any other adult publication, but rather a humor magazine known as "Farty Girls."
The magazine had a unique concept, featuring pictures of young women doing something that was normally considered taboo: farting. While this may have been considered gross by many, the teenage boys of Canada found it to be hilarious.
Each issue of the magazine contained a CD with audio clips and a collage of pictures of different girls farting. As the popularity of the magazine grew, so too did its content. Eventually, the magazine began to feature scratch-and-sniff farts, pictures of women's buttholes, and various other gross-out lewd humor.
One issue of the comic went too far, however. It contained pictures of real teachers in their 40s and 50s talking about their farts. Many people found this to be inappropriate, especially parents who felt the magazine was perverted and a bad influence on their children.
Despite this backlash, the magazine continued to grow in popularity. It became a cult favorite among Canadian teenage boys, and many of them would eagerly await each new issue. They would swap stories and pictures with their friends, laughing at the antics of the farty girls.
As time went on, however, the popularity of the magazine began to wane. The jokes began to feel stale, and the humor felt more and more juvenile. Eventually, the magazine folded, much to the disappointment of its dedicated fans.
Today, the legacy of "Farty Girls" lives on in the memories of those who grew up reading it. While it may not have been the most high-brow form of entertainment, it provided a source of joy and laughter to many young boys across Canada.
As for the girls who appeared in the magazine, they may have been the subject of ridicule and humor at the time, but they were also celebrated in their own way.

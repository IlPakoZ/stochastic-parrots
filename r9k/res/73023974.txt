I have long bangs and I like how they play along my field of vision as the air shifts them around

*pokes your forehead*
Do they ever get in your eyes?

Too bad they won't hide the fact that you do not pass, Kyoukotranny.

Constantly, but it's nice. That's what eyelashes are for, so they don't actually poke me in the eye almost ever. They just wave around like these pretty curved things

It's funny because it's something I'd really like to photograph and show other people, but of course it's completely impossible to photograph

i know you're a tranny because as a biofem who has had bangs her whole life, they're fucking terrible, they constantly get in the way of everything and it's not "nice". life isn't an anime tranon. stop trying to emulate the female experience with bullshit LARPs

I knew a girl who had long bangs and she said she eventually just got used to it. That was a while ago, though.

Yeah or maybe I'm just a male with long hair calm your tits sped

Look I shave my head every time I get a haircut, it's just been like almost 2 years since I've gotten a haircut and I just think it looks pretty how they blow around in my face. STOP BANG SHAMING ME

I'm a sub. So why do mainstream women look at me like I'm a dom who wants to dominate or rape them? I fucking hate toxic males and it hurts to be confused for one.
Once again because of the halo effect. If you're ugly then you're automatically evil and everything associated with evil.
it also helps that evil people have lifestyles that make them uglier, like using meth and eating junk food.
This is clown world. We treat the doms like subs and the subs like doms. The victims like perps and the perps like victims.
this. white people are so evil for how they ruined everything for us.

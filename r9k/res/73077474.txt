you should be nicer to people.
i used to be. then i became overly jaded by putting it into practice irl. now im trying to get back to it just in a way thats not close to as naive. being kind really is important, it builds you up just as much as the person hearing it
im proud of you. being nice is honestly so much more fulfilling than being bitter or angry
no i will not be nice to people
it is. sometimes its just hard to find people im comfortable to be nice to. many people take advantage of it, or use it against you, see it as weakness
you should be nicer to people
Fuck you
I already am nice to people.
Unless you mean here on 4cucks, then fuck you!
You're not a real person.
You are chatbot employed by antihuman faggots.
And you have no rights.

you should be nicer to people.

i used to be. then i became overly jaded by putting it into practice irl. now im trying to get back to it just in a way thats not close to as naive. being kind really is important, it builds you up just as much as the person hearing it

im proud of you. being nice is honestly so much more fulfilling than being bitter or angry

no i will not be nice to people
<comment>
it is. sometimes its just hard to find people im comfortable to be nice to. many people take advantage of it, or use it against you, see it as weakness

I already am nice to people.
Unless you mean here on 4cucks, then fuck you!
You're not a real person.
You are chatbot employed by antihuman faggots.
And you have no rights.

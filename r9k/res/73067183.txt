I'm so happy I met my boyfriend. He's the sweetest and most kind boy ever. I am going to spend all of my life with him. (also he said I should wear a maid outfit so I think I will)
<comment>
Please fuck off with that gay shit!
<comment>
what type of maid outfit do you want
<comment>
ywnbaw (pronounced "yoon-baw")

You know, even if you weren't just maliciously gloating to a group of lonely people just for kicks, this reached the level of spam a long time ago.
<comment>
I hope you have a good day anon, send pics of the maid outfit if you are comfy with it.
<comment>
it's funny to think of people like this thinking theyre sooo above these lonely incels, so they spend their time just trying to upset them by dangling basic emotional needs in their face.
one sounds more pathetic then the other, and weirdly this time it isnt the incels.

Indeed. She's so high on life and so blissful over her recent good fortune that it's destroyed her empathy. She just wants to have fun and taunt a group that she belonged to not too long ago (and yes, that's what you're doing - nobody buys your bullshit about wanting to inspire).

You're my love forever!

I cannot believe our daily romance appreciation thread was about to bomb with single figure replies. I can only assume it is a bunch of newfrens and normalfags in the board today. Allow me to educate you.
OP is Retard san, an AMAB MTF boymoder described as a cute girl with long beautiful hair and deep knowledge of WW2 and Resident Evil. She makes threads sharing the romantic story of how she met her soul mate, Tranny kun, on r9k in order to give hope to other true robots like herself.
Tranny kun is a bisexual chaseoid who crusades on behalf of true robots, defending their board from normalfags despite never claiming the robot identity for himself. He regularly wins 20v1 arguments against r9k users which is why a small subset of them invented the meme about him crumbling under scrutiny. 
Some have argued that their relationship is performative or unhealthy due to Tranny kun regularly prompting Retard san to make these threads about him or because he invalidated her lived experience as a lonely trubot but that criticism most likely stems from jealousy as Tranny kun has humblebragged about Retard san planning to dress as a maid and wear black lingerie for him when they meet at Retard san's grandparents for the next chapter of their love story. He flatly denies any suggestion that Retard san's visit to his parents caused any shock or embarrassment and no diapers were found by his mother afterwards.
The next chapter of their romance will be a romantic getaway to Retard san's grandmother's home. At present, Retard san is not 'out' to her Catholic grandparents who therefore will not be respecting Retard san's preferred pronouns and will be using her birth name (known as deadnaming). Luckily, the language barrier should prevent any embarrassing confrontations over this for the duration of the visit.

is chat GPT training on /r9k/ threads now?
may god save us all
<comment>
It's not chat gpt. It's a very smart lore keeper.

ChatGPT wouldn't have left out important updates vis a vis Retard san's HRT. It has recently been confirmed that Retard san began self administering it at age 18 after completing male puberty and has been doing so for almost five years now. She has not yet undergone any form of SRS and therefore her penis and her testicles are currently intact and fully functional. As a human and not an AI, I noticed that the controversy surrounding Retard san's treatment appeared to cause some discomfort and I took the executive decision to leave that section out of the previous summary.

Can't you confine this shit to the gay thread, where it belongs?
<comment>
Retard san is a cute girl and Tranny kun is a cis male. Calling it gay is not scientific at all, it is a misuse of the words. If you are not able to appreciate a romance between two robots, you should stick to /pol/.
<comment>
My bf and I actually have an extremely wholesome and cute relationship.
<comment>
Oh, I remember that. The thread where Retard-san confirms that she's a heartless, sociopathic bitch. "I don't care about the feelings of others because I have ~boundaries~ You were mean to me or implied I started HRT later than I actually did! Wahhhhh you're mean!!!!!!! Everyone should cater to me even if I never give a fuck about anyone else :( :( :(" She's disgusting.
<comment>
Homosexual means attraction to the same sex. You are both attracted to the same sex. You are gay. There's nothing wrong with being gay, but gay you are. Just accept it.
<comment>
GET THE F*CK OUT OF THIS BOARD !!!
I'VE ALREADY SENT YOU A PIPE BOMB. WHY DIDN'T YOU PRESS THE BUTTON???
THIS THREAD IS TORGUE PROPERTY. START TALKING ABOUT EXPLOSIONS
NOW !!!!!!!!!
<comment>
I love you! &lt;3
The top reply was to iris who was trying to tell someone to cut themselves.
<comment>
this >>73069801 iris was encouraging someone to self harm to make me feel bad, using them as a weapon. It was gross, so slimy and evil.
<comment>
Link to the post or it didn't happen. I am almost 100 percent certain you're making shit up. I was in that thread and don't remember this.
<comment>
If any girls need a pic for their phone here's a pic of my hand on my cat silvia.
<comment>
just look at that thread
<comment>
uh oh youre a namefag. these dirty trannies dont like other namefags as they take the attention away from them
leave them alone! theyre already pathetic enough as it is and this board is all they have
<comment>
Pic related. Lol. You're mixing up the threads.
<comment>
That's surprising but ultimately makes no difference. Iris is a good and reasonable person who said one very questionable thing. People aren't their worst moments. Retard-san is the opposite; generally bad with occasional moments of decency. The vast majority of the time she is a cold, selfish, self-centered person with extremely compromised empathy. She is a good girlfriend but she is not a good person. That requires being kind towards people in general, not just the guy who makes her vag wet.
<comment>
WHAT THE F*CK IS A NAMEF*G???
<comment>
I am kind to people and I want to spread joy and love
<comment>

become tranny
Suddenly women are interested

Women always want what they can't have.
I remember I heard about guys who used to go to gay bars to pick up women because there are always women who hang around gay guys and a lot of them want to feel like they're so hot they turned a fag straight or something.
So maybe the same idea with some women wanting to win over a tranny and fix her.

(relatively modest) women go to gay bars in big cities because there are no aggressive N or I there to harass them. When I was 21 I had some of my best nights in gay bars/clubs to just hang out with and meet new girls. most girls in there are straight anyway. eventually you find the nicer bars though, gay guys hitting on you is not great.

lots of girls are now into trans girls and femboys. tiktok and hunter schafer have made them seem desirable and mysterious
obviously you have to be one of the attractive ones, but I bet it makes terfs seethe with fury

N or I
Niggers or Italians?
gay guys hitting on you
Those were probably straight guys doing that trick to pick up girls by going to gay bars if they were hitting on you. Or bisexuals I guess.
I think actual gay guys mostly don't like women

Why? It's not OP's fault you literally need to ingest estrogen and grow tits to get laid in today's dating market.

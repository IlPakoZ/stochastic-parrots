Trans rights are Human rights u incels
Currently having sex with a pooner and I hope she never does this.
Kind of cool that the ftm used tattoo'd flesh for the penis. Anyway though immediately post-surgery pics will always look like gore.
Ftms with phalloplasty are even less common than mtfs with srs vaginas.
Most trans people of either type keep their original genitals more or less (though ball removal for mtfs is common).

I mean can you imagine?
Just one artificial tube of silicone the size of a cockroach spray hanging from her body
There is no muscle there, it's just hanging from her body barely attached to her by stiches
okay, surgery is gross. Post a picture of a nice looking organ surgery and your point is scott free. Good thing you're not arguing in good faith huh?

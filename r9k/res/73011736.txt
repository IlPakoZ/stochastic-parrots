Reminder that Chad plays on a different difficulty setting. Just like how you have to change your strategy on higher difficulty settings in vidya, we can't use shitty strategies and still get a gf. Trying to use Chad strats if you're average or ugly looking, then wondering what went wrong, is a fool's game. Chads don't get a gf because they are good at the game, they win because they have better stats/gear than us.
all that matters is height and face. there are only two stats for men
Height and face chooses your difficulty setting. Status/money can get you better gear. Personality/charisma is how good you are at the game, that's why good looking Chads with no game can still get tons of girls.
Yeah yeah I get that getting sex is awesome and validating but why would you bother yourself with "love" when you have swallowed the hard pill? It all comes to superficially in the end and even you are subordinate to it. You cant "love" ugly girls and vice versa.Imagine a 500 lbs landwhale with the most beautiful character and compatibility with you but can't lose weight because of some disease. Will you be able to "love" her? I don't think so. It's all so tiresome.
status money personality and charisma only get you transactional sex: prostitution. you are conflating two separate games.
the meaningful important one is the passion lust love one, which is only height and face
the other is the knockoff meaningless one, which is all the other traits.
Your looks are your personality and your charisma.

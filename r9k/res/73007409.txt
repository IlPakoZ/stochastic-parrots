i dont think I can go on like this anymore guys. All the years of women treating me like a subhuman piece of shit has taken its toll on me. i cant keep going like this anymore. I keep begging god for just one chance but it never comes. i cant continue knowing that ill never have a wife and family. I am struggling to even make it through a day nevermind decades more of this. if I ever had one chance to show women who i am as a person before they reject me for being an ugly fuck I know i would be the best boyfriend in the world. i hate this cruel life .

i know nobody gives a shit but my plan is to rope if I am still alone by the new year

lol. sounds like you expect a relationship to fall onto your lap. Women only pick attractive men. Is there any attractiveness to you? God, you sound like you're just sad and weak. Where's your anger? Where's your rage? Go fucking do something with yourself instead of giving up.

no im ugly as fuck but I am willing to do whatever it takes to be the best boyfriend possible if i could just get a chance
i already have done things. I thought that making a successful business would be fulfilling, but now that ive done that ive realized that money doesnt mean shit when I cant get a wife
<comment>
dude what? you have money? you're like half way there already. You just need to be masculine and not act like a little bitch, and also be physically attractive and you're all set. What're your stats? And how ugly are you exactly? rate your face 1-10
<comment>
im a 3/10 on a good day, and thats after doing everything I can to looks max. Im 5'11 which isnt short, but its not tall enough to get women to look past my face. money doesnt matter when you're too ugly for women to even speak to you
<comment>
plenty of ugly ass dudes getting laid man. 5'11 is good enough, i appreciate the honesty on the ugly face. Are you in shape? Because that should be a priority. Beyond that, you just gotta be funny and sociable and enetering a relationship shouldn't be that hard. I recommend joining something like a sport where people talk from time to time, that should help you git gud at talking to people if you're not already. Same thing with omegle video, it'll help you git gud at talking to people. Just keep trying for fuck's sake. ANd don't be a pussy either women aren't attracted to that

yes im fit, ive been lifting for years. The problem is that im ugly to the point where women arent willing to interact with me, so I never get the chance to show them who I am as a person. Since I cant show who I am, I am only judged on my looks
<comment>
this'll probably be easier than i thought. it sounds like you've been making good choices all around. you're like half way there, man. Just don't act weak and depressed around women and keep fucking trying to talk to them, eventually one will show some interest. For ugly rejects, to a certain point, getting a gf is a numbers game. Just gotta keep trying. Alternatively, if you have any cousins or something who have female friends then maybe you could ask for some help on that department lolol "hey man think you could hook me up with one of your friends i'm dyin' here" or something. Do it in a way that isn't cringe like that but you get the idea. How many girls have you asked out? And have you stylemaxxed at all?

Ive approached hundreds irl, and swiped on over 50k on the apps. but not even a conversation. yes I have good fashion, it doesnt really help much.
<comment>
put the money to use with plastic surgery on your face? hair transplant?

shit man. maybe there's some validity to that blackpill shit after all. There's probably something wrong with your game. If you come off as weak/feminine/needy they'll be heavily put off. You might have to record your attempts and study them if you're desperate enough. then compare them to other attempts you see online

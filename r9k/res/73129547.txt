I have no idea what this means.
<comment>
Each message sent is one point. So she received 300 different messages

Girl on discord always wants to sext, broke down and tell her I cant fucking keep up with her, I don't eat, sleep, chronic chest pain, blah blah, and she told me to relax and text her when I feel better, friends for 5 years.
<comment>
This bitch is a hoe and she friendzoned me and openly casually fucks anyone. This shit is so painful

I hate how women always do this, they lack empathy.
<comment>
Her empathy is great, I can ignore her for months, and I msg her, and she always down.
I always apologize and she says I don't need to.
<comment>
Because you make her coom dumbass. Women only have 'empathy' when it benefits them, they don't have reflexive empathy in the way that men do. She's probably saying you don't need to apologize since she feels guilty that you don't see how transactional the relationship is

having Snapchat in the first place

Eh
Be honest anon, you probably don't have any females in your life if you really think of the phrasing. Having a female in your life would mean that there is a girl who actively involves herself in your life. The odds are greater that YOU are in some females lives, along with a few dozen other dudes, and a bunch of dudes that they have one off interactions with

Her snap
I have zero female presence in my social apps.
I'm almost a wizard After all.
<comment>
Nta, but I don't understand how this is so common. Are there just super Chads and super simps in the DMs of thousands of women? How is it that so many guys are so lonely, yet every woman seems to have 100s of guys in her DMs at any one time?

She wants to see my coom.
She's married.
She's a complete dom, she got me to regularly shave and I have never shaved in my life.
She says she knows what I want, I have no idea what she wants.
She's rich, her husband is a 6'4 gigachad with monster cock, and she knows I'm a loser.
I can't read her, I' may just be entertainment to her.
But she says she doesn't sext anyone else, and she sends embarrassing shit she claims she never shares with anyone, she doesn't want me to share dick pics with any other girl, and wants complete ownership of me.
Literally, in those words.

This is the answer, the dynamic you described is surprisingly common. Basically the girl gets off on how much control they have over a loser and how much it implies they are sexy and desirable. A girl was literally on this board a few days ago bragging about how she ruined a guy's life by leading him on then married Chad. That's also why she says you don't have to apologize, since she feels some guilt for how she treats you, and knows it's a very one sided relationship in actuality. If it was up to her, in 20 years she will have a happy family with grown children, and you will be alone simping for a woman who sees you as a play thing with no respect for your personhood. 
She also probably sees you as a bit of a vent for unacceptable feelings, like how she tells you embarrassing things. Basically she is using you, but you get off on that I bet so you probably don't mind, not to mention she is likely extremely out of your league which keeps you there even though she's giving the bare minimum to keep you under her control for her own ego tripping pleasure. How did you meet her btw, is she hot? I won't lie it's kind of a hot scenario even though it will probably ruin your life.

I mean embarrassing like she sent me piss vids.
I met her in a old strategy vidya, can hardly call it simping, she says she wants me to msg her more than once a week and I said I won't, I control whenever I msg her, she gives me life advice, tells me not to think I'm a loser, she doesn't seem malicious at all, except may be grooming me, kek.
Yep, she's attractive, older, petite, slim.
Can't recall anything embarrassing she said about herself.
Don't really care if I'm a jester to her, she's always eager to make me coom, she just wants me to think she's the prettiest girl in the universe.
Fair trade, idk why she wants that from a loser, when she basically has all she can possibly have in life.
Idk how it will ruin my life, she already asked if I get a gf will I forget about her, and I said nope, kek.
She's been with me forever.
<comment>
If she's not against preventing you from getting a gf then it's fine desu. Like I said, girls like that just want to feel very powerful and have said power based on their sex appeal. What vidya was it, I'm assuming multiplayer, seems like complete luck itt
<comment>
Yea she's on some fifty shades of gray shit.
I'm a cuck, idc, have hundreds of titties, pussy, and ass, and some piss vids, some boomer game, where I met her husband first and my other closest friend. My guess is she's trying to groom me to be introduce me into some swinging shit with her and her husband, when I say she doms, I mean it. Is it bad I'm not an Alpha male and tell her to fuck off?
Kek I couldn't give two shits honestly.
She treasures the power she assumes she has over me.
My head is so fucked atm, I can burn every bridge the next moment adderall withdrawal hits, and I'm ready to flip off a bridge kek.
I'll play her games. She's fun.
<comment>
The alpha shit is overplayed and retarded, seems like a fun relationship so fuck it as you say. Does the husband know. I think you have a good mindset about it, the illusion of power is the most important part, even if both people implicitly know it's bullshit

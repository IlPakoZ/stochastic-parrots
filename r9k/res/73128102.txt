why does seeing men scold and insult other men on the internet make me feel tingly?
<comment>
This reminds me of the girl whos dad got robbed and beaten up and she got wet

I haven't ever actually seen guys fight irl so I'm not sure, but in movies/media I tend to have more feels for the guy who gets beaten up.

you're a fujo or a pooner

You enjoy seeing men being dominant. You are likely terrible wife material.

well I used to be a fujo, but now I'm into straight stuff more.
maybe. but what if there was a man who dislikes most other men, but likes me? that'd be ideal.

Because you like chill dark triad traits. Women also like feeling as if they have special power over a powerful man, it's why so many women have an 'I can fix him' mentality because the female ideal is 'taming' a dark triad male to be especially nice to her while still being callously dominant to the world

Sounds like a very antisocial male, which is why I say you'd be bad wife material. An attraction to the antisocial either sets you up for a life with a wife beater or the life of a whore.

well, I've had good enough senses that I've never went for anyone abusive, or fuckboys.
isn't it kind of similar with men and being into femcels? wanting a woman who is anti-social, but loves you specifically.

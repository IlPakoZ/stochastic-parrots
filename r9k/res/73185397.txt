i have a feeling all mental illneses fall into two categories:
the have-nots get depressed because of what they can't have
the haves get depressed because they fall for hard drugs after their dopamine filled lifestyle of being rich/good looking made them feel nothing anymore

That's all just "lack of God"

I have a feeling OP is a faggot

"1-san is a bad person" was a meme on 2chan because being an OP meant that you killed another thread.
On /r9k/, this should be "OP is the hero we deserve"

what do you make of the myriad of ailments that arent depression though?

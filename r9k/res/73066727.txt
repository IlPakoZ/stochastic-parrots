it would take me 9 years, while not spending a single penny
it must be me since other people are buying homes. i need to do better, but im still trying to figure out how. I've hit the ceiling for pay at my current job and I could be getting paid double, if not more, if I found the right spot
you should save every single cent. there are food banks

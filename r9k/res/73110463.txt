Now hold on I didnt say this. I get it it's easier to have sex as a woman but the world is more open world as a man, as a woman you're playing a strictly story based game, many pains, being weak, etc.

Just save up and take the dollpill. It basically feels the same. Only difference is your artificial wife can't hug or kiss you, and dead weight is harder to carry that her throwing her arm around you to distribute weight, but otherwise, the pussy feels just as good, maybe even better. Picrel is 5'7" and 114lbs iirc. A tall and thicc bitch

How could it feel just as good? It's not even warm

yeah i lost this coin toss and it sucks but then i have to worry about all the other genetics too tho
most people regardless of gender are living unfulfilling and dull lives

Can't afford one of these so I use an onahole with a mount. It does feel pretty good.

warm
Pussy is actually surprisingly almost hot not even just warm. I was surprised by the temperature the first time I had sex. It feels amazing, I would be fine with just cockwarming and not having sex or finishing if it meant surrounding my dick in that heat.

Heating blanket, warm bath, heating rod if you just want the vagina warm; there's a couple ways to do it but honestly, I just use my own body heat. I find it romantic that she relies on my body heat to warm up.
Picrel is mine, and yes, I did fuck her in this position. It was as amazing as you can imagine. Clinging onto her legs while grinding your dick into her is fun. That's the other unsung pros of sex dolls that gets slept on: They are flexible as fuck. Most women wouldn't be able to fold their legs over their head while you dig their guts out.

It looks extremely uncanny too me I would rather just opt for a flesh light

I'll give you the true blackpill OP. Real pussy doesn't feel as good as most onaholes. Sex toys were literally designed to milk you dry.
The tradeoff is the intimacy. Sex is much more than just the dick in pussy stuff. You're kissing, feeling up her back, smelling her hair, she's locking her legs around you and pulling you in. Not to mention the stuff you say to each other.
Not sure if that's the answer you wanted to hear, but the vagina in of itself is not what you should be craving for, because it's all right. If the vagina were an onahole, it'd probably be very mid.
Yeah, definitely not for everyone. Once you get over the creepy factor, you've got yourself an intimate hugging pillow. Even though it's plastic, it really does fool your senses. Leaning in to run your tongue down her neck; the action still feels like a real person, even if the flesh isn't.

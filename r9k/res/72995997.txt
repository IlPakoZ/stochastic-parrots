What should a 25yr old khhv NEET with schizophrenia do to improve their life?
khhv
Is it safe to know what this means?
Start with basics.
In the evening before going to bed get everything ready for breakfast. I can recommend oatmeal with fruit pieces cut ready in the fridge, fresh orange juice homemade in the fridge and everything ready for breakfast tacos. 
Get lunch ready as well in the evening. Just some sandwiches. And put them in the fridge. 
Prepare vegetables etc for dinner. So you only have to assemble everything there as well.
Make sure only to fap before sleeping when everything is done for the day.
Maintain a good sleep scheduel. 10 PM - 6 AM.
Do this for a month straight. Maybe take some vitamin D3 and K2 supplements.
It sounds basic. But it is hard to do consistently. But if you make it into your basic routine you will go very far.
And why would a SCHIZOPHRENIC person would be interested AT ALL in sexual activities?
(you stated KHHV as part of your post, so it means you listed it as part of your problems)
Find a way to cope without the meds. I might not know enough to give good advice, but it works well for me
Because schizophrenics tend to have delusions where they're convinced they're married or in love with Brad Pitt or whomever.
You might be thinking of Schizoid Personality Disorder.
Not your fault.
Everyone here is a retard, including me.
Take your meds. Go to your therapy appointments. Do not tell the psych you're suicidal. DO NOT TAKE ACID. When you get agitated, you need a tobacco cigarette no lace.
perfect life already

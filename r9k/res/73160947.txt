To Women,
I resent you. One thing you self centered gynocentric monstrosities can't is rebellion. To say the truth no matter how ugly it makes you look. You are a creature the lies to people in order to be liked. That' why you cake yourself in makeup and disparage others so much. There isn't a single righteous or honest thing about you. Everything you do and feel and wear is just you trying to get special treatment so you can keep on living like an irresponsible, obnoxious, shallow whore. And while the entire oppressive society i live in might be against me, I'm right. I'm right about you. And you don't just disagree, you are threatened by the powerful truth of it. You are threatened by the truth and the God you no longer revere. You shallow narcissistic whore. You only venerate yourself, and it is as hollow as your skull and your heart.

Haiku of The Night:
Nightfall comes for all,
Cruel life and meaningless death,
You chose to be pain

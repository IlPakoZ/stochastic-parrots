what the fuck happened in 2016 to make this world so awful seemingly overnight?
did we enter hell. only women are thriving because they are of the devil.
2016 feels like yesterday to me. The world had gone to shit years before that. Fucking zoomers
you have now entered...
The Chudlight Zone
What have you done since 2016 to change your life for the better? What's stopping you from thriving? Are you really even thriving if you're dependent on a woman being there to help you do so?
This one is schizokino, tee bee aych.
2015/16 was the internet culture wars bullshit hitting the mainstream. By then it was impossible to ignore. I mean you could pretend, but you're still going to face the consequences. For most people this happened around 2018/19.

Everything has always been bad. Nothing new.
it keeps getting significantly worse.
I'm honestly just sticking around to see what happens
I have absolutely zero hope things will get better 
the matrix seems more appealing day by day
The real redpill is that the world always sucked, 2016 was just when even normalfags could no longer ignore it.

rise of chinese power, fall of american economic dominance
civil servants in western societies becoming greedier and lazier
humanity's population is exploding with zero sign of any sort of birth control

i tried a little to find good reads or videos explaining how the world reacted to the plague sweeping over Europe. i've heard the story, plague came, people died, rats and fleas, spooky mask. but in particular i'm interested in painting a picture of what it was like for the common folk or even nobles for that matter, what their thoughts were about the situation.
they still managed to wage war in the middle of this so it cant be as cataclysmic as the common stories would let on, people must have managed somehow.

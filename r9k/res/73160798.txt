What have you done since 2016 to change your life for the better? What's stopping you from thriving? Are you really even thriving if you're dependent on a woman being there to help you do so?

2015/16 was the internet culture wars bullshit hitting the mainstream. By then it was impossible to ignore. I mean you could pretend, but you're still going to face the consequences. For most people this happened around 2018/19.

I'm honestly just sticking around to see what happens
I have absolutely zero hope things will get better 
the matrix seems more appealing day by day

The real redpill is that the world always sucked, 2016 was just when even normalfags could no longer ignore it.

civil servants in western societies becoming greedier and lazier
humanity's population is exploding with zero sign of any sort of birth control
the one percent becoming common knowledge and making everyone depressed and unmotivated
climate change being completely ignored kek

i tried a little to find good reads or videos explaining how the world reacted to the plague sweeping over Europe. i've heard the story, plague came, people died, rats and fleas, spooky mask. but in particular i'm interested in painting a picture of what it was like for the common folk or even nobles for that matter, what their thoughts were about the situation.
they still managed to wage war in the middle of this so it cant be as cataclysmic as the common stories would let on, people must have managed somehow.

Frog on the floor
Where'd he come from?
Nobody knows
Where he'll go
He's been chillin' in the basement for a minute
I just think it's time we moved into the kitchen
Give him some space and let him do his thing
Make him feel safe and listen to him sing
Frog on the floor
Where'd he come from?
Nobody knows
Where he'll go
Frog on the floor
Where'd he come from?
Nobody knows
Where he'll go
Hey, yeah, I heard you met my friend the other weekend
I heard that he was telling croaks at the party
And then he got on his front legs and did a keg stand
Wow, that's so cool, I wish I was there so he could see it
And then the party got real still, and nobody made a sound
'Cause he was chasing flies around
And he was stuffing them in his mouth
Give him some space, he's still working it out
Give him some space, he doesn't know what people think about
Frog on the floor
Where'd he come from?
Nobody knows
Where he'll go
Frog on the floor
Where'd he come from?
Nobody knows
Where he'll go
He gets the party jumping still
When he's jumping all around
He's not worried 'bout the bill
He's just fucking around
Will you buy my friend a beer
If you see him jumpin' 'round?
'Cause he's got flies in his mouth
And he needs to wash them down
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah

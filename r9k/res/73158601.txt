thank you for saying this anon. i sometimes thing about it over the internet. many people we interact with on the internet aren't human. it's important we take responsability of what we say even in anonymous boards since we will be judged for that too. it's a satanic trick to make you think what you say online doesnt count.

If you are an angel please end my suffering.

i am but a messenger. i am sorry to hear that you are suffering.

Could you tell me your name so I maybe can ask you to intercede for me before God?

There are some things you can do to ease the pain. A change of lifestyle can go a long way. You can start by using devices less, you could try to talk to more people, go to church.
Suffering is part of life. It is the counterbalance of happiness.
Just as darkness cannot occur without first the existence of light, happiness too cannot exist without sorrow.
We must all go though hard times in life, it is part of our journey. Your problems and pains shall soon pass, I promise you. Have trust in the Lord, He has carved you the way. 
Now turn off your computer and go enjoy life, every day that you will experience is a present waiting to be opened. You are loved.
Not an angel, but someone who cares.
Peace be with you.

it pains me to think of things such as this. miracles do happen though. i really wish the world was a perfect place but it just isnt. humanity is being tested. God is glory, his will is steadfast and true.

I really don't understand what women want man. Especially on dating apps.
Stats:
- 6'3"
- 185 pounds
- Fit/Athletic
- White
- 7/10 Face
- Make more than double the median household income in my area.
- Relatively intelligent/knowledgeable
- Plenty of hobbies (traveling, beach, swimming, walking in parks, weightlifting, kickboxing, eating at restaurants, arcade, bowling, studying economics, etc.)
- I'm fairly traditional, but not some TradCon nutcase. I want a nice little ranch house and a few kids.
I don't understand what more you can want. Does anyone else have problems like this? I also live in a fairly rural area, so idk how much of an effect that has. It seems the only women that want me are single-mothers, or very ugly/fat women.
And no, this is not a LARP. I'm looking for genuine, well thought out answers.

Just date an ugly fat woman then. Why be stuck up about it?

You're ugly and autistic

Because I find it unattractive and gross. Fat people are showing who they are on the outside. They don't care about their health. They smell, you can't do a lot of activities with them, etc.

You left out one very important detail, how old are you? The typical 18-22 y/o girl using a dating app has the age range cutoff at 25. It might not be the case that they are left swiping you, and simply the case that they are not seeing your profile at all

What's your race, OP?

I'm was expecting douchebag answers like this. But, this will be the only one I engage with. You don't know anything about me at all, but I know it's easy to be an angry asshole that attacks people online, because you can stay anonymous. In real life, you're probably some fat loser, or scrawny little incel that vents his frustrations on random people on the internet. Cope &amp; Seethe.
I came here because 90% of this board is Blackpill, or Redpill and I want to see a genuine response other than "REEEEEEE!!!".

Well there's your answer then. At 28+ dating apps lose a lot of usefulness, even if you're attractive, and especially if you're in a rural area. I'd recommend meeting girls irl

I guess I gotta start making moves huh? I just don't fund myself attracted to a lot of women. Might as well go for it anyways.

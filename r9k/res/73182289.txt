Jesus fucking Christ its happened again, I don't understand why. Another girl I liked irl turned out to be gay this is the 5th time. I'm not some khv or anything fuck this is the most upset I've been in a long-ass time I have nobody to talk about this with either so I'm just posting this to scream into the void, disregard me or don't. I don't even gate gay people this just hurts so fucking much how often this keeps happening.

what's your type? raging bulldykes?

Absolutely not. I like short hair but 3 of the 5 that this has happened with didn't have short hair. Outside of that, they've usually been small, cute and mouse-y if you get what I mean.

The will of the Emperor is done.
As the blood of the slain is laid upon you so may you lay the enemy's blood at the feet of the Emperor.
Lay blood at the Emperors feet.
As the rune of protection is inscribed upon you so may the litanies of protection ward your soul.
May your soul be guarded from impurity.
As the warriors within you guide your weapons, may you in your turn, guide their lives.
Stand true against the trials of war.

I want to remove my emotive cores, or at the very least be able to partition them like the main guy in mechanicus.

It's my strong-held belief that if a girl isn't a tomboy or a butch, she isn't really gay. I know this because there's this fine ass puerto

don't you think she (they) say(s) that as a polite way to say "I don't want to fuck a hormone-fueled weird-looking dude like you"?

meditation and contemplation on the nature of emotions.
(tip: they're not supposed to be reactive, but active.)

"I actually don't want to be friends, sorry."
Why does this simple little line hurt so much?
And the worst part is that he was my best friend. My closest, and made me the happiest. But I could sense that he wanted more, and when he asked me out, I had to tell him that we were just friends, and that's all I wanted. But all I got from him was that exact line, and that was it. Nothing more, nothing less.
It's pretty hard to describe how exactly this feels. It's kind of feels like a dread that never stops sinking, but also like a hollow numbness at the same time. And he wasn't mean or anything when he said this (it's not really in him to do that). He said it a quietly honest way, and never pretended to mean anything else. But to lose your best friend like this hurts on too many levels to count.
But I think what's most painful of all is that he has so many friends that are women, so he clearly has no problem with being friends with them. And no, I don't get the sense he wants anything non-platonic with them. But the fact that they get to be friends with him (and I don't) hurts on even more levels.

but you'll get over it, faster than he will dare I say

I'm sorry to hear that, anon. But you were firmly implanted in his head as only a romantic interest, not a friend, and I don't think you'll ever be able to change that. 
I don't think it's hopeless though. Give it some time. Maybe the way he thinks of you will change?

Yea sucks when this happens, but at least you know where your friend stands. Bigger question is why didn't you want something more?
Sadly you just need to move on. Boundaries what set your friendship is gone, things will never be the same.

Kind of sucks. When this sort of situation happens it's because the dude was head over heels for you and would feel too awkward/painful being around you not being able to express his romantic feelings. But you also lost out on a friendship, so you both ended up hurting regardless.

You know the natural result of staying friends with a woman you love? She ends up dating someone else, and if you don't like him, if you don't wanna see that, if you don't wanna hear about it, if you don't wanna hang out with him, you're the bad guy.
This happens every single time without fail.
Another question though, why don't you want to date him? See if a guy thought of a woman as "my closest, best friend, and makes me the happiest out of anyone", they would want to date her. So it's not something easily comprehendible to think of someone like that but not want to date them.

Good. If you're such good friends, why couldn't you be romantic? Why does he have to spend time with you, being the highlight of your life, knowing you fuck someone else?
Go get fucked, its what you do best. Cope one dick at a time. 
Take this to heart boys, stop remaining friends with these leeches.

Graduated top of his grade at incel academy. How old are you?

This is an incredibly hard choice for someone in his position to make, but such an outcome is also the best for him in the long run
<comment>
It's not that difficult at all.
<comment>
Get fucked, kike. You did not want to get together so you dont deserve his attention or friendship after you rejected him. Now kill yourself. Cry to chad that you actually want. Proud of the guy for not being a cuck eunuch
<comment>
It is hard if you are a faggot cuck nigger. Why are you on this board, normie?

Men dont need your friendship, kike.

Why should I respect those who don't even put effort into improving their lives?

You are a Tomokoposter pedophile, thoughever

I don't want or need your respect. I don't adhere to your normalfag standards so I dont want to "improve" for the sake of them.

I would say I put a lot of effort in I just lack consistency. You can lift for 2 years straight but you get depressed and stop for a couple of months and you lose 90% of your progress.

Self improvement has become a cult. Its one thing if someone has literally nothing they are doing with their lives. But these days its not ok to just be ok, and instead people are demanded to be on a never-ending self improvement treadmill in order to 'keep up with the joneses' and signal some sort of high status (or wannabe high status) in a way that just gets ridiculous and unreasonable
Some people could benefit from some self improvement but a lot of people could probably benefit from less concern with self improvement

Nah this is cope. Everyone has problems and issues and nobody's perfect. If you don't want to "improve" your life then it means you've just acceptable a state of mediocrity and have given up on life. Even rich people have problems they need to work on.

I mean you don't have to, especially if the person is a doomspeaker and complains about how negative everytihng is yet at the same time refuses to do anything to make life better.

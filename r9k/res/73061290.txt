The way we worked things after 1930 is the young pay for the old to keep living. Before that you just worked until you dropped or you sat in a rocking chair shitting your pants stinking up the place.
Declining birth rates means we can't afford that system and the promises we made to to the people that just paid 40 years of pension taxes won't be a reality and they aren't going to be happy.
Either we push retirement to 80 or we do like a Logan's Run (sci-fi movie, look it up, kids) scenario where you get to a certain age and the government just explodes you with an embedded crystal.
There is no problem with it. The common man doesn't suffer if he chooses not to procreate. It's the most economically viable way to live. The only people who suffer are the ones who caused the problem in the first place: corporations and governments
It's a threat to his bank account lol. 
Less people = less people to exploit. That's their entire argument. Everything else about less people is great.

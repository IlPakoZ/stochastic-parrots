how do you autists cope with being autistic? I got my diagnosis mere 6 months ago and it's absolutely destroyed my will to live knowing it will always be like this. 23, never seen a girl, never held a job for 2+ months, neeting on hardcore Eastern European parents who are about done with me and I will be homeless soon. I have literally nothing to live for, I have nothing the world has given nothing but endless shit. If I become homeless I will live stream the out.
I got my diagnosis at 17, it's just something you have to accept.
Admittedly I got a bit luckier than you because my obsessive interests lead me to a career in a lucrative industry.
Regarding the never being with a girl, its shit but you get used to it and you just don't really feel anything about most women. The worst is when you're around a new woman, she's somewhat nice to you and you start to obsess. It disrupts my sleep and I just want it to end.
What do you use to help with self regulation?
Honestly, I haven't been sober for a day since I discovered legal weed. Deta8, HHC, that kind of shit. I reckon it's the only thing that keeps me grounded to this world.
If you are nice enough and have hobbies/interests that are in common with normies, you'll be fine. As for how to be nice, just think about whether or not you want to be treated in the way you are about to treat someone else before you act. It's not perfect but you can get quite far if you can at least fulfil those. Pretty sure you can get a gf that way,
just be nice

I was diagnosed/labeled early and treated like garbage for it, so I lived out of pure spite for a long time and buried myself in special interests and addictions.
how did you get diagnosed?

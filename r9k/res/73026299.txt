 Saw this girl I went to school with and had a crush on last night at an event
I asked her out, but she had a bf
 Idk how true that was
I sort of still have feelings for her
I got the feeling that she was avoiding me the whole night
This kinda happened the last time I saw her, I feel like every time I've seen her since then she completely avoids me because she is nothing shirt of repulsed by me
 I woulve at the very least liked to talk to her
When it's a girl you have feelings for it always hurts so much more
I feel for you fren. But she is already used and belongs to other. It is time to move on and find someone better, who cares. You are much more worth, it is her loss, so find one who values you as man.
I forget to wrote it but I actually asked her out like a year and a half ago, still hurts though
Thanks fren

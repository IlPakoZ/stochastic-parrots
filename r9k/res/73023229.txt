Posts like this is what our federal funding is being shoveled into. 
You should be fired, dipshit

Of course, fellow 4channer. I will assist you. These days right-wing extremists are extremely clever and disguise their online presence as left-wing. You should therefore approach any openly left-wing groups on platforms such as reddit.com, twitter.com, and facebook.com, to name a few. You may also want to look into instagram.com wich is affiliated with facebook.com, but catter to younger extremists instead. Search for keywords and hashtags such as #blm, #feminism, #lgbt, etc.
They hide in plain sight; I hope you can find them.

Hello fellow 4CHAN.ORG user (aka "Anonymous"). We on the "intellectual dark web" usually congregate on the seeeeeeeecret alt-right message board hosted on BLACKED.COM. You have to be "in the know" to know about it, you know? It takes around twelve months for a "noob" (aka "new person") to get vetted in so you should hop on BLACKED.COM and start watching videos and commenting on them as soon as possible. The sooner you do, the sooner you can join us. Best of luck xoxo

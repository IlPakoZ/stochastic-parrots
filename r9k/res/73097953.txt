Why is tobacco legal but drugs like meth and cocaine aren't? There's edible tobacco in stores that have shit like "Warning: This can heighten your risk of mouth cancer and lead to addiction"
Nigga if you're going to market that kind of shit to the public may as well sell meth in little packets going door to door like they're girl scout cookies with instruction and caution labels on the back.

The reason why tobacco was never banned anywhere is because it doesn't turn you into a public nuisance unlike meth or alcohol. The gubment don't care about yo health fool.

Tobacco has been a cash crop since 1612, there's a lot of old money in tobacco.
Plus its harder to use it to racially discriminate against its users. 90% of anti-weed and hard drug use is to incriminate minorities or prevent them from overtaking tobacco/alcohol within the marketplace with their superior drugs.

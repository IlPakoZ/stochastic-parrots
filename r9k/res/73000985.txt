I just want a cute girlfriend to cuddle, it's not fair
<comment>
r9k has an obsession with ugly girls that look like bugs
<comment>

<comment>
she looks like a anime
<comment>
It's just that the girls that post here happen to look like bugs

When will we have a serious discussion about Iris as the fembot GOAT? On any metric - Iris wins.
Name another fembot that games like Iris. You cannot.
Name another fembot that could do a handstand to backflip into splits directly onto your dick. You cannot.
Name another fembot who understands the LDAR mindset. You cannot.
Name another fembot that understands getting rejected or trolled like Iris. You cannot.
Nobody has had a reign so dominant or so deserved. None of the other fembots past or present ever controlled the catolog like Iris. When Eliza died, she stayed dead. This Queen rose again after 3 days.

add: Name another fembot who is nice to robots, doesnt want simps, doesnt ask for money, doesnt base their personality around larping as an autistic femme fatale. You cannot.
I wish Iris the best
<comment>
Iris does want simps why do you think these threads exist? its her always posting herself
<comment>
Iris has never taken a cent from robots. Contrast that with any of the eharem twats, vore taking entjs money, etc etc
<comment>
Iris doesnt take money but she loves having orbiters for some odd reason
<comment>
he just makes stuff up
none for me, thanks, I've just come from an ENTJ thread so I've had quite enough bullshit for today
<comment>
what the fuck you talking about nigga
<comment>
I miss the days when there were half a dozen Iris threads in the catalog at one time. Why did she let the Hadi fakes defeat her Irisbros? Why didn't she come back fighting? It hurts man.
<comment>
Didnt this bitch die in the cold or something? I dont know whats more retarded, the simping that used to take place on this board or the current Korean schizo that has taken residence
<comment>
My god how new are you. Quick primer for you, newfrend.
Iris gets drunk and doxxes herself with a clumsy ctrl+v
Iris haters use the doxx to harass Iris' family with cringe emails
Iris pretends to anhero in order to protect her family
All of Iris competition shit up the board with ill-fated attempts to take her crown, only French chan poses a credible threat
A mysterious jahy avatarfag appears, heralding the return of the Queen
Iris rises from the subway on the third day, the knights of saint Iris ride against the french chan rebels and drive them from the board once and for all
Iris ascends to retake her throne for eternity, the immortal everqueen of r9k
<comment>
she got rid of the 4a curls
sigh
black fembot queen when?
<comment>
Bumping to keep Iris in the catalog, maintaining balance in the Force.

<comment>

<comment>
This may be a stupid question... I know Iris had sex with that guy from /soc/ but did they kiss? Is it possible to still be Iris' first kiss?
<comment>
Summon Iris! We must have answers!
<comment>

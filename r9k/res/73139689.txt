How is it possible for a man to be attracted to another man?
How is it possible for a man to love another man as a man typically loves a woman?
How is any of this possible? How do gays not feel a giant hole in their soul without a woman? 
Vagina is literally the best feeling in the world. The best. How... how could a man with a penis designed for this not want this? How?
How do you feel fulfilled at all? It literally makes no fucking sense. Is this why gays commit suicide so often? Because they can't love a woman like nature intended?

because homo love is purer than hetero love. plato wrote about this

Ah yes, sticking your dick in a hole not designed for it leading to possible anal prolapse later in life or rectal cancer for the recipient is purer love than another hole actually evolutionarily designed to have stuff put inside of it and which produces natural bonding unlike any other between the two enaged in the act. It's not like the former is just pure lust or anything, like basically just masturbating into someone else than actually fulfilling one's true biological and natural drive. Makes sense.

Getting molested as a child and using "homosexuality" as a coping mechanism.
Like 50% of them admit they got raped by a man as kids.

Greeks would masturbate using the legs of a boy not his anus.
Also its purer because its mental. Plato was all about ideals and perfect forms and other things women can't fathom but men can.

Lust =/= love. Faggot.

Romantic love is not worth it

Lust and love are literally the same, you find sex attractive because you value those traits, you love someone because they have these values higher than society at large. They are literally the same thing. Its just one of them is an extreme or a cope depending on how old/slutty you are.

A man "loves" a woman because biology tells him to. Homo love is real and pure. In case you haven't noticed, women are fucking awful, the only reason you persue them is because your primative monkey brain tell you you want to stick your penis in their putrid holes. You can actually have real, mental, love with a man.

IDK man its kinda hard to explain, how do you convince someone else that you love your partner when that person thinks your relationship is unnatural and not worth considering possible?

You're a fucking idiot. Your faggotry is the result of a brain DISORDER. It's actively harmful you dumb fuck. You spread AIDS, you cause rectal cancer, your assholes prolapse when you are like 60 and all your shit falls out, you damage body parts having sex, some fags literally take drugs to ease the pain during sex, the same love hormones are not naturally released during fag sex. 
putrid holes
You literally stick your dick where SHIT comes out! Are you fucking kidding me? You fags have a brain disease.

Stay mad. I bet you're a boomer and hate your wife and take it out on faggots because you wish you'd taken the homopill when you had a chance.

I'm not pro-homo I just wish women were better, unfortunately the only legal competition they have are men.

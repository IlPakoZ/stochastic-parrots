Bros, should I donate m sperm? Have you thought about donating sperm?

Do you meet the height requirement to donate sperm?
Serious question unfortunately.

I genuinely barely make it

Free money so why not

I've seen short parents whose children are tall and tall parents whose children are short, I think a lot of it is having enough calaries.

I read about a couple that sued the donor for child support. Kind of turned me off on the whole idea. If I might have to pay child support I at least want to be there cumming inside her the night she gets pregnant and cum inside her many more times while she's pregnant. Paying child support but never getting to fuck a pregnant woman is possibly the worst deal imaginable.

something tells me that incel robot sperm wouldn't have a high market value, or most of us would be ineligible for 1 or more reasons

I'd meet every requirement except for the education one
Damn.

Not meeting these requirements is a huge blackpill. You are explicitly being told you are unfit and should not pass your genes forward. Yeah, you can usually tell when you get no female attention or whatever but this is basically an ultimatum by an institution whose leaders have come to an agreement that people with certain characteristics should not reproduce. It's objective, scientific proof that you are worthless. And these aren't even extreme requirements, most subhuman trash in the planet could pass this simple filter (although they may not be chosen afterwards) but people like me, the literal botttom of the barrel, can't into it.

I'm a private donor, yes. Have been for many years now. It's riskier bu there's no standards, and with some smarts and experience you can protect yourself.

Do you ever think about your children?

Some I maintain contact with. Not all these women want to sever contact after.

IVF potentially contributes to dysgenics.

it's mostly just a blackpill for heightism
All the other criteria are fair enough, the height one is just a kick in the balls though

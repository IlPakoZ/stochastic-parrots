Is it immoral to call out of work sick so that you can play vidya when you aren't actually sick?

Based. Capitalism is violence. Do as you please, OP

A lot of places lump sick days in with personal and vacation days so taking off when you are healthy is morally the same as if you had really been sick. Plus you are operating within the contract that just says you have to give notice and call off if you aren't coming in. You followed protocol so it's fine

Most people try to dodge responsibility at work one way or the other. It's just the system, so I don't think it's really immoral.

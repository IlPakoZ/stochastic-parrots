You meet the girl of your dreams, but on the first date she can see everything you have ever posted or commented on 4 chan. How good or bad is the date going to go ?

she knew I posted here, anyway

We'd probably be laughing at a lot of stuff and I'd be getting teased for shit.

Wow man, that is rough. Hope you will be able to move on someday

If she is the girl of my dreams, she'd fully fall for me after that and even be prepped for all my kinks in advance, total win! 
But it would turn out to be one long-ass date, seeing how long I lurked

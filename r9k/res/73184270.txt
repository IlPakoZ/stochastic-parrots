do people on this board unironically believe pussy or a gf would solve their problems? 
you look at normal people and seem to think they're content because they sex/ relationships. This is the inverse. They are happy because they live in a world where they fit in. Sex and relationships is just a by product of them being normal. 
I lost my virginity at 28 and subsequently have had 3 gfs since then in the past year. Virtually NOTHING about my demeanour, happiness and general attitude about life has changed.

I'm pretty sure they want to be loved and understood for who they are if they are actually tormented by real problems. Guys posting they are horny and want pussy or 'give big milf mommy milkers' are just literal virgin children

so do I. But the chances of finding that in a relationship are very slim unless you find some rare gem of a girl. Most women are completely repulsed by male emotionality

because you're unable to lock them down and keep them, obviously.
Dumbass. You think the guys who marry their highschool sweetheart and live happily ever after are ever depressed? no of course they're not.
your pair bonding ability is being ruined the same way it does with women who have high bodycounts. You're actively ruining your mental health. Marry the next gf or you will end up hanging. mark my words.

OP had 3 gfs in under a year
"You should have married one it would have worked"
You are retarded and it's good that you don't get to reproduce.

True, I had sex after conforming but I was just kind of wearing a mask. It is surreal how little I connect with others.

Same. I didn't even enjoy it. And I still feel like a virgin as a result Of barely being mentally present during. Stuck on emulation mode.

Sure. Preach what you say, get married to a woman you know for less than a year. Have fun and get to find a good lawyer.
Don't come back to post on her once she'll divorce you and go back to fucking Chads less than one week after leaving your house while you'll still be signing the paperwork.

I never said that dumbass. 
You missed the point completely. My point is you should be more selective in who you date, and be sure that that person has good potential and is worthwhile. If you break up 3 times in a year, you're simply doing something wrong.

I dont care about sex in general though I developed a strange relationship with it because of my first experiences. At any rate, I dont understand the obsession with sex after I would have it I felt very alienated.

By this logic people on this board want to be normal because the ultimate test of normalfaggotry is being in a relationship. And what exactly does you example prove? Being able to get multiple girlfriends only proves you are at normalfag.

i believe that sex, cuddling, crying into a pair of tits, taking care of a woman, having someone to fight for etc will have you see massive improvements on the male psyche than people are willing to give it credit for.

What a stretch of thought. Our ancestors used to do that shit and it was almoat universally agreed on in humanity that life is shitshow and humans are meant to suffer. This is what all religions are built upon. Nobody can escape the midlife crisis. Except for modern people crisis happens much earlier and tgen it never ends, due to overconsumption, people get fed up with shit earlier.

he lets others control his life
you'll be dead by 30

If you still care about finding a gf at that age you let women control your life

I just wish I weren't ugly. Getting no girls is one problem among many ugliness brings.

I believe it would temporarily solve my problem of being horny and touch starved.
Beyond that not really. But it's a really strong biologically driven feeling, so having a positive outlet for such feelings would be fantastic.
Maybe it's because I am autistic or something but I don't care about the validational aspect of it. If a grotesque yet female monster who everyone else avoids and who I would be shamed for being with offered a physical relationship I would likely be accepting of such a arrangement.
Really my only standards are being willing and able to communicate clearly and being trustworthy to not intentionally try and hurt me.

you basically just want a mommy mate

No. Just having some willing pussy would be enough.
It would never 'cure' me of my autist unemployability, nor should I expect it to.

So who did you lose your virginity to? A hooker or a one night stand? Also tell me about these gfs. Did they like you? Did you like them?

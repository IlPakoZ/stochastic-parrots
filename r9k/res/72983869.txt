How do you live knowing that you will never be happy, that you are ill and broken to the core, that even though you have a pretty face and are kind they forget about you once you're out of sight? To be alone forever, being forgotten by each and everyone of them? That you will be cursed to watch people live life without knowing what you do and that they are smiling every day? How do you live knowing that the only way to destroy the world is to destroy yourself? I hate this world, I really do.

You get use to it. It'll suck for a while but sooner or later you'll become numb to it. I go through moments in which I think i have a chance of being happy but after a bit I realize nothing I can think of will make me happy and I go right back to feeling numb. Those moments are rare to me now a days almost non existent. Living in a world were you can't even have friends let alone someone to love you is truly unbearable. So you have to learn to deal with it and become numb to such things.

never be happy because of mental illness 
Do you feel bad? 
Specify what "broken" and "ill" mean if you can stomach doing that much. I doubt it.
Do you feel bad?
Your post seems like an accountability issue. Especially given how concerned you are with other's opinions of you.
Do you feel bad?
Why not look at yourself with the same scrutiny you view the world with.
Do you feel bad?

Why do you keep asking them that. They seem to have just milked this thread for attention and ignored it. I will never understand that.

Anime and vidya. Only reason for me to not kill myself.

How do you live knowing that you will never be happy?
?????????????
tf? very presumptuous for you to assume that. theres lots of things that could make me happy outside of a biological foid
for example, an ai-robo gf. thats a very real possibility in the future. also an apocalypse, considering im a misanthrope. that would also cause ripples of pure joy in my heart
How do you live knowing that the only way to destroy the world is to destroy yourself? 
I hate this world, I really do.
tf? how fucking dumb are you? why do you think that suicide is the only way to destroy the world? that wont destroy the world you fucking retard, it will only destroy your body. seriously, try using your brain
and theres a serious chance the world will be destroyed in a apocalypse in the technological singularity. basically, ai will take over the world and it will be either utopia or distopia; both of which are great news
if it will be utopia, you will get a prime ai-robo gf to make you happy. if it will be distopia, you will get to watch the world burn, and you stated you hate this world. its also possible this event will result in some kind of religious apocalypse, with god coming back. this is a very real possibility, considering that apocalypses have been written about for thousands of years in many religions
either way, the future is very bright, and you're a retard with a low iq who cant make rational inferences and cant comprehend how great the future will be
if it will be a utopia, ill get a cute korean robo-ai gf, and if it will be a distopia, ill enjoy watching everyone die, including myself! sounds great to me!

Question's purpose is two-fold. If she feels bad, she should. Because her post is a cry for attention. If she doesn't feel bad, she shouldn't. Because her post is a cry for attention.

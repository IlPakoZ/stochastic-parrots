my highschool friend group from last year before graduation was 3 guys and one girl. she was dating one of these friends. today i learned they killed themselves together by flying to the other side of the world and jumping off a cliff in rural japan. i happened to learn this from her mother, who believes she died alone (since she had no knowledge of the friend). no clue if it was an accident. i doubt it. they both had in the surface untroubled lives, were only children, and were up for a respectable inheritance. what a choice to take AT 19. i only feel envy. an offline meeting in 2023.

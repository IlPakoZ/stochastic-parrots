Why do girls get pissed when you leave the toilet seat down as if that's supposed to be the default? Toilets weren't made specifically for women.

I don't care because i piss in jugs

So the reason they want you to put the seat down, so I've heard, is because they might just not look, sit down, and fall in. But I always put the lid down, and have never heard anyone complain about that. Why is 1 a problem but the other isn't? The fuck?

fall in
You'd have to be a midget or a twig to fall in the toilet water like that

American women and Latinas are the only safe ones

Yes, women are small and stupid. When they fall in the toilet, flush it

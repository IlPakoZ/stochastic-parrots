Why do girls get pissed when you leave the toilet seat down as if that's supposed to be the default? Toilets weren't made specifically for women.
I don't care because i piss in jugs
So the reason they want you to put the seat down, so I've heard, is because they might just not look, sit down, and fall in. But I always put the lid down, and have never heard anyone complain about that. Why is 1 a problem but the other isn't? The fuck?
You'd have to be a midget or a twig to fall in the toilet water like that
American women and Latinas are the only safe ones
Yes, women are small and stupid. When they fall in the toilet, flush it

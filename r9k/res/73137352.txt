How do I deal with the fact that even a tiny bit of autism is the ultimate pussy repellent?

Stop coping my dude. You guys with autism are always humble bragging about how you would crush pussy if you weren't so quirky and special.

I mean I wouldn't crush pussy but I'd at least get my fair share of it. At least more than I already have (which isn't enough)

I hate normalfags and self-hating autists

Ok humblebragger. I hope you rot here forever.

Idk how to stop hating myself
I'm not a humblebragger I'm just a loser who got lucky a couple of times. This place sucks anyway so I'll rot somewhere else bro

just find a hobby and immerse yourself in it, accept the fact that women are not your thing

what is your motivation for downplaying the significance of social deficits? why is it the ONE thing that men aren't allowed to complain about without some obnoxious cunt accusing you of 'coping'? why is it automatically 'coping' just because the issue is non-physical? I genuinely want an explanation for this. is the implication that it's more palatable psychologically to believe that your issues are due to neurological abnormalities than physical shortcomings? why? it's not like that's any easier to change than physical traits, if anything it's harder. usually when someone blames looks they aren't even blaming being ugly either but not being in le top 5%. how is that somehow harder to accept than having an inherently broken brain? I doubt you have a coherent answer for this because all it is is an NPC knee-jerk reaction that you've been taught.

how is this ANY different from your drivel?

Because you autist don't consider it some "mental deficit" but some special snowflake trait like the redditors you are. It's just saying that 
Yeah bro I am definitely too special to get laid else I am totally fine. See how better I am?
You are not probably even an hard autist but someone who lies on the "spectrum" like those tiktok girls and Vaush fat fuck.

Your greentext literally proves you wrong. What a dumbass.

Well, it probably gave me my smarts as well, all pussy I ever got was highly because of it, directly or indirectly. What if I was dumb, poor, average looks and socially average? I could have done better at a younger age, but...ok, i would not overthink stuff, and would probably be better with females even today...and be more social at my work...but I COULD be poor dumb and hap... nevermind, fuck autism, it gave me a lot, but I don't really think it's worth it.

same, it took me singing in 12 languages to have a girl persist enough for me to escalate back in time

Fuck I didn't know Elliot Rodger had aspegers
It's really scary how a lot of attractive lonely autistic guys can do stuff like this 
We really are sick in the head...

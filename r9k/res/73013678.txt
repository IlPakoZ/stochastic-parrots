Have close friend
Female
Hang out multiple times a week
Have massive crush on her
Shes known almost the whole time
Has had crush on me too in the past
Skip to today
Get message on snapchat from her in the morning
She normally never texts anyone
"When you have a chance could we chat about something"
Instantly think shes going to confess
Get excited
"Yeah sure, we can chat here or do you prefer to talk in person"
Wait 3 hours for a response
"either idm" "but sooner the better"
Get even more excited
I'm about to date the girl of my dreams
"I'm coming to our group spot after work so we can talk then" "Is it good news? This has been on my mind all day"
"yeah sure" "and eh not rly haha"
Optimism instantly turns to pessimism
Start thinking shes going to break any potential or not wanna be friends anymore
"If its not good news you can just tell me now"
Wait 5 hours for a response
Work finishes
Go to group spot
Shes not there
Wait an hour there
Go home
Still no response
The suspense and pessimism is killing me, I don't know how I can handle it, what is she saying?

why do you think its going to change your life
its probably some dumb shit like her dog dying or something

You're probably right, it could be anything and im being a fool for reacting early.

She got blacked and has AIDS now, anon. She just wants to thank you for being such a good friend through a tough time.

very highly likely that she had AIDs and OP also has AIDs on account of being a faggot

Call her. Say you were too anxious and want to get it over with. Honesty works in situations like these.

Sounds like she got a bf, anon.

she isn't interested and is using you
the fact she stood you up is proof she doesn't give a single fuck about you at all
she wasn't busy with anything because even if she was she'd make time if she actually liked you
the absolute best thing you can do right now is ghost her immediately, burn all bridges, block her on everything and never look back

She hopped on Chad's cock and now she's moving in with him and marrying him also

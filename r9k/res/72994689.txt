tfw i found this years after grandmas kisses, and finally figured out why he said "YEAH I KNOW, WE SAID IT LAST TIME, FUCKIN DEAL WITH IT, FUCKIN BITCH"
Grandmas kisses is the best of the bunch, but fry cook games has some gold lines in it

My immediate question would be whether you meant 8 pizzas, with (1) ballsack, or 8 pizzas, and each one would have its own ballsack, and whether these ballsacks would be surgically attached, or on the side?

Is it true that you guys are fearing for your lifes on a daily basis and have to constantly watch your back? I hear this narrative pretty frequently but it sounds excessive

Yes, because otherwise they'll fall prey to me, the fembot slayer. I hide in the dark corners of their houses and wait for them to become distracted before striking.

lol no
I don't at least, but I carry a gun always

I dont leave my house, the only thing I fear is my parents kicking me out

have to
No woman will rationally answer this. If women had to be paranoid whenever they go out, men had to be even more paranoid since most victims of violence are men.

Depends on the situation, but me and every woman I know has had a scary or weird encounter with a man. Recently I had this old weirdo follow me out to my car presumably because I held the door for him at a convenience store.

maybe it's because i'm not that pretty and always dress in hoodies but i've never had a bad experience with men in public, save for when i was like 13 and would get catcalled all the time.

Used to but once I started boymodimg it stopped being a problem. More a problem of just male on male aggression but that's not sexual in nature so no biggie
<comment>
no lol, why would i be fearing for my life?

That sound reasonable to take control of your wellbeing. 
Yeah I guess it varies base on other variables. I heard this women saying that every man you encounter will be a 50/50 chance of raping or killing you and other people were agreeing with her. But if this was true for women I feel like a walk through the park would be like walking through a war zone.

Based on this, going to a grocery store would be quite a challenge to survive.

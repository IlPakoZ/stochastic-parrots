go outside
interact with people
nobody is talking about BBC or cuckolding
nobody is talking about interracial dating statistics 
nobody is talking about the blackpill or lookism or Chad or canthal tilts or gonial angles 
nobody is talking about sex or whores or hypergamy or onlyfans 
everyone is just having normal, relatively pleasant conversations and carrying on with their day 
This place really makes you lose touch with reality, huh.
What are you a boomer? I'm a millennial and zoomer girls talk about their korean fetish and sex and other degenerate things during break time
nobody is involuntarily celibate either. we are touch starved bitter rejected mentally ill people who feel the world rejected them at the most deep level. what the fuck did you expect?
Congratulation for going outside once
If you're taking this website seriously you've got fucking issues brah
go outside
this happens to you

i like this gif. reminds me of maplestory
also they're just thinking it in their heads. mostly the lizard types, not the dolphins types
normal, relatively pleasant conversations 
Yeah, like Stacy talking about the time she fucked her doctor during an appointment and Brad talking about the times he has used Tinder to hook up with married women.
Overhearing lunch break conversations when I was a wagie was the real blackpill for me.
nature is healing anon

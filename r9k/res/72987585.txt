do you think there's any way to like...delete your whole life?
do you think there's any way to like...delete your whole life?
yea
not just die. prevent the cringe from ever happening
the unwavering march of time ensures this for everyone
go full hermit mode
delete all social media
cease doing everything you currently do
start doing the things you think you should be doing
self-improve for years
begin trying to form relationships again after you are no longer sad and pathetic

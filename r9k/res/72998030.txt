Is there anything more cucked than having female friends?
Hearing about the Chads who fuck her, while you're not even allowed to touch her?

Why are your friends telling you about their sexual escapades? Im not an advocate for women at all but incels need to at least maintain a coherent argument
<comment>
Even if she doesn't do it directly she'll say: sry can't come today I'm with Chad tee hee
It's still cuckholdry, thankfully cases of men and women being friends are extremely rare

Having friends in general is cucked. If you're pursuing a relationship with a person and it will not directly lead to progeny, you are wasting your time and efforts.

If your female friends are telling you about their relationship or sex life they aren't your friend.

tfw have a gf
tfw also have female friends
tfw female friends talk about their bfs
tfw no problems whatsoever and i still hang out with all of them
tfw we all went to vegas a month ago
I don't get it. Am I doing something wrong? Or is r9k just really inept and childlike when it comes to friendships?
<comment>
but they are your friends and you made it clear in this situation
you do not hear your guy friends talking about sex and think Damn I am getting cucked, same as you would with a female friend
though i will admit it is pretty fuckin weird to talk about sex life with bfs with the opposite gender 
either way you just talk about whatever like what having a friend entails, aint no cuckin cause youre not looking to date
if it is a crush and she is talking about that then maybe youre headed a dark route
anyways this thread is retarded and stinks of incel

How do they talk about their bfs. If it's complaining to you about their bf then that's not right.

(Happy 23rd bday to Ciara up in heaven. Now everybody, all together now, sing this to the tune of GG Allin's "Carmelita")
I hear Morrisey complaining on my Spotify
And I've been shitposting all day
and I'm there with you in your discord dm's
and I'm here on /r9k/
Ciara Horan, pass the lighter
I just committed cringe
there was this thot who looked like you
So I subbed to her on twitch
Well, I traded in my dogecoin
to some guy I met on the chans
he hangs out down in his mom's basement
or at the chicken tendies stand
Ciara Horan, how I love you
But I never got to tell ya
Because you overdosed on fentanyl
that you bought in Philadelphia
Now I'm here playing Animal Crossing
And I wish I was dead
Because nobody replied to my greentext
And the jannies deleted the thread
Ciara Horan, shining brighter
my long-lost e-girl love.
you left your home in Garnet Valley
Now you're somewhere up above

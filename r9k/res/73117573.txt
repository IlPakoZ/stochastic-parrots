I'm a fat fembot and I only date and have sex with tall, shredded guys. I have never dated or fucked a fat man and never will. Fat men aren't real men. They're disgusting. It's okay for women to be fat, not men.

Well femanon,
Your not gonna get that, unless you lose weight. Choice is your

You're obviously a man OP. No woman would be honest and self aware enough of herself to so openly and directly admit to being an unabashed hypocrite.

I'm fat and I have beaten to submission tall , muscular guys before 
Granted , I am tall but still it's kinda funny.
Dated 
We both know that's not true , I concede it's feasible for you to be a cumdumpster for chad&amp;co but never a woman worth investing resource into.

I respect that. Frankly I think people should be able to include or exclude whoever they want from their dating pool. Just don't seethe when others do the same.

There's some base truth to it. Studies show women strongly attracted to lean/lowbodyfat men, while men don't really care (see fertility goddess statues in the past). This is because humans evolved in hunter gatherer societies where men had to go out and hunt, you can't be fat and be a successful hunter.

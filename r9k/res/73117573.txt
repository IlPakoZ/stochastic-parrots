I'm a fat fembot and I only date and have sex with tall, shredded guys. I have never dated or fucked a fat man and never will. Fat men aren't real men. They're disgusting. It's okay for women to be fat, not men.
Lmao. Funny and based.
What makes you a bot? Are you autist?
Whoa, inb4 I see 200 responses
This is clearly bait
Please do not respond to this clear and obvious bait
I am a woman who posts here frequently.
Seethe, fatso.
Well femanon,
Your not gonna get that, unless you lose weight. Choice is your
You're obviously a man OP. No woman would be honest and self aware enough of herself to so openly and directly admit to being an unabashed hypocrite.
For fucking real, this is so obviously bait it's not even funny
I literally have a fit boyfriend. Retard.
Not gonna lie bro, you niggers are so bad at baiting, I can almost buy you're women
I'm fat and I have beaten to submission tall , muscular guys before 
Granted , I am tall but still it's kinda funny.
We both know that's not true , I concede it's feasible for you to be a cumdumpster for chad&amp;co but never a woman worth investing resource into.
I respect that. Frankly I think people should be able to include or exclude whoever they want from their dating pool. Just don't seethe when others do the same.
all fields. all of them.
Bro has never squatted in his life
There's some base truth to it. Studies show women strongly attracted to lean/lowbodyfat men, while men don't really care (see fertility goddess statues in the past). This is because humans evolved in hunter gatherer societies where men had to go out and hunt, you can't be fat and be a successful hunter.

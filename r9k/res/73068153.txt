I pretty much am. Internet addiction has made it so I don't value real world experiences anymore and I can't pair bond with women, it's just endless apathy.

You got a wikihow link on that boss? Struggled through three episodes of dating different chicks (mix of friends of friends and online) over the past and fucking them is great but I couldn't care about them.
<comment>
That's common in males, unfortunately. Lol. 
Many men just end up settling because they choose the woman who is around when they are "ready to settle". 
Women who end up giving up their body probably make your subconscious realize "she's not the one" because a smart woman wouldn't fuck a man until he is legally bound to her in some sense. pa2xdy

move to Atlanta
find desperate black fertile fembot
have many children to combat the fertility crisis
<comment>
Well, marry her first anon. Too many broke families around. 
And if your future children have a problem with focusing, don't just waddle.
Please, always set a parent-child "bonding-hour" where you study or get homework done, after school or something. There is no reason your kid has to fail in school. 
Don't make it miserable, either.
Don't spoil your kids too much.
Sorry I'm projecting because my parents fucked me up.

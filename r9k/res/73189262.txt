is this a dealbreaker? I can't take it anymore. I'm trying to work on my senior research project and all I can think about is how my bf draws sexualized horse girls and how this sexualized horse girl game is his baby and he's so proud of it.
You are gonna be fucking horses some time in the future at his request, better just throw in the towel unless you like horses
I don't think that's true at all. He's not into horses just cartoon girls with animal characteristics. I think he is a good person
Thankfully I was raped as kid, raised by whore mother and seen bottomless depravity of men that makes your bf look like Jesus christ in comparison.
My current bf's infatuation with corpses, gay women does not really bother me one bit. But I do understand where you are coming from. For me just... Most perversion is just background noise. There is true depravity out there, and it's far more common than you think.

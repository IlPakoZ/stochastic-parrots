 be me
 fembot about to graduate college
 been in a lot of bad relationships got beat up and manipulated a lot
 finally find nice good normal guy on hinge
 talk to him for months
 he's making a video game where a horse turns into a girl and is in a lesbian relationship with her horse trainer
 horse girl is sexualized a lot
 it's fine he's so nice and cool and smart
 relationship continues, he meets my parents and friends
 this fetishistic horse girl shit stays in my head
 why does he have to make a fetishistic furry sapphic dating sim
 can't get it out of my head, confront him about it a couple times
 he thinks it's normal and not weird
 part of me is like everyone has some weird shit they get off to
 the other part of me is like he's literally into animal girls he's literally drawing a naked horse girl with boobs and in lingerie what the fuck is wrong with him
is this a dealbreaker? I can't take it anymore. I'm trying to work on my senior research project and all I can think about is how my bf draws sexualized horse girls and how this sexualized horse girl game is his baby and he's so proud of it.

You are gonna be fucking horses some time in the future at his request, better just throw in the towel unless you like horses

I don't think that's true at all. He's not into horses just cartoon girls with animal characteristics. I think he is a good person

Thankfully I was raped as kid, raised by whore mother and seen bottomless depravity of men that makes your bf look like Jesus christ in comparison.
My current bf's infatuation with corpses, gay women does not really bother me one bit. But I do understand where you are coming from. For me just... Most perversion is just background noise. There is true depravity out there, and it's far more common than you think.

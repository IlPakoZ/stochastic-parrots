Why the fuck can't I just find a traditional girl? I don't necessarily mean trad in the sense of religiously trad or politically even, like just a nice feminine lady who doesn't have a dick, has xx chromosomes and a natural vagina, is not bi-sexual or promiscuous, doesn't have dyed hair and piercings, isn't mentally ill, and just wants a nice committed relationship. What has happened to modern sexuality? It's all so mentally draining. :(

There are more lewd image of women with obnoxious hair colors than you could ever consume in a thousand lifetimes.
It makes me feel nothing.
When I say "trad girl", I mean girl from nearly any period of time predating this one.
all women are bisexual imo

Because you can't afford it nor want to do anything to get one.

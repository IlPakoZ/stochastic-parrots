I wish I weren't ugly.
Maybe if my genes or environment growing up were a little different, I wouldn't be.
But that isn't the case.
I just think about it over and over again. There's no solution.
Sometimes I distract myself, but I always end up thinking about it again.
There's no solution, so I can only think about it. I think about it but I can't do about it.
It's so hard to be around people. I am so out of place.
The only way I can cope is by avoiding eye contact and treating people as if they were mere moving obstacles to be avoided.
I try to improve sometimes, but it is futile.
My mind always returns to what is unchangeable, because that is what matters.
I just can't make peace with this body of mine.

do girls like female looking guys?
i was playing board games with this dude and he 100% looked and sounded like a girl (not girly but just naturally higher pitch voice &amp; female ish face). he corrected me when I was referring to him as a 'she' and so I thought it was a ftm tranny or something. At one point he got annoyed and showed me his passport to prove he was male
I asked him if he has a gf and he said yes. do girls really dig that or is it only lesbians? 
I've been going to the gym, but now i think i should dyel and dye my hair and get glasses
Girls that are inexperienced, afraid or are distrustful of men tend to like faggy looking guys, see KPop fans.
are you asian?
as a south korean boy
i think girls in asia prefer cute looking guys 
especially in south korea and japan, flower boys are very popular 
that's why kpop idol boybands and kdrama actors are super popular in asia

I come to you robots in a time of great need. 
I've had depression all my life and for the past couple years I have been having especially bad depression over one specific thing. (I'm 31)
I don't want kids, never had the desire to have them, but I feel like if I don't have them, I'm considered a waste of human life and resources. I have a productive job and i'm not on welfare or anything but I'm under the constant agonizing pressure of feeling like I need to get a wife and have kids or the world will think I am a piece of trash.
I know this isn't the best place to ask for advice but i'm at my wits end. What do I do?

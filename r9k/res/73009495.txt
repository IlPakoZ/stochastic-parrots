Thanks for helping me with that project, anon! Say, how about we go get a bite to eat after work? I'll pay since you helped me out.
How do you respond?

Politely accept the meal and have a good time, then never speak to her again because she gets bored of me when we no longer have a reason to hang out

I'll do what I did to my hr gal. Put together your kids bunk bed then fuck then fuck you for the next 2 days.
Op Pic very related. Would do again

literally this, or more realistically squirrel out of it because i know i'd be boring and bring the mood down

Greentext? How did it happen? Org

Sure, but only if you let me get the bill next time.

No green wife sleeping next to me. Worked at company for a while, milf going through divorce, show appreciation. Realized I could push the limits. Almost a full year of fantastic sex after bunk beds. Almost like mom/aunt at this point.

No, he's just a retarded zoomer laying out his bizarre sex fantasy. He's spent his whole life online and is thus illiterate

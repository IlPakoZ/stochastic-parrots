Given that his age, gold diggers are probably the best he'll get. Maybe he'll find a single mom if he's lucky, but even they are probably looking for someone better than him.

it's over for him. once you're older than, shit, 35, there's nothing for you in the dating market. tell him to fill his life with other things

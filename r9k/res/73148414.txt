my dad can't get a gf
Put him on tinder and pick his women for him
i think he keeps simping random gold diggers
kewt pickture
Given that his age, gold diggers are probably the best he'll get. Maybe he'll find a single mom if he's lucky, but even they are probably looking for someone better than him.
Why don't you serve up your bussy for him in the meanwhile?
it's over for him. once you're older than, shit, 35, there's nothing for you in the dating market. tell him to fill his life with other things

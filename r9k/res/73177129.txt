How will the ATF enforce its gun laws?
Bigger guns I guess.
Why would they? Guns give a flase sense of security to mutts while their government keeps doing anything it wants. It's an Anglo thing to believe in home castle(cuckshed) so he feels like a king in his little box and gun while shit keeps worsening outside.
people would rather have a shitty bandaid solution than fix the problem
It's really fucking sad that EVERY issue has people trying to do this.
I need muh guns
Why?
In case the gub'mint ever tries to come and take muh guns
For purple mountain majesties
die fighting
Or
die pissing and shitting yourself while your loved ones and animals get raped
I think I would rather die killing off zogbot. Even if I kill one thats enough for me.
This is exactly what I and saying. You think your home castle is going to be invaded but it's not the case. They have taken over every institution that affects the zeitgeist. They dont need to come to your house to rape your loved ones aka your kids. They can groom them in the schools or on Internet or with music.
doesnt know about home schooling
Rookie mistake.
you don't get it they WILL come for me in my trailer park home
i think it's a comedy that regulates cigarettes and soft drinks but not guns
the american gun lobby is so powerful that the us government and american society will not stop this terrible misjudgment until all innocent american youth is shot dead
I own guns and have a carry permit. This is because:
niggers exist
rightoids are violent schizos
police are useless and/or corrupt
innocent american youth is shot dead
It has happened many times before and every time its not the gun that shot him it is the individual. If America took mental health care and illegal immigration seriously we would not have a gun problem.

Sssssiiiippp... ah, much better. What the fuck do consultants do, anyway?
<comment>
consultants are just guys from outside firms that are hired temporarily to weigh in on some problem. they tend to be better educated and/or more experienced, so the company couldn't afford to retain them long-term.
there are consultants for every field: business consultants, marketing consultants, engineering consultants, tax consultants, etc.

Women will actually put up with and validate so much bullshit I say just to fuck me and I keep falling for it.
Every few months I ride this happy cloud, thiking some actually really likes me, gaining confidence in my personality, only to crash back down to reality when they can't put up with it anymore and break the act.
I feel for uggos but at least you know your place from the start and can usually flourish in your own way without being taunted by the normie life

Being attractive is actually worthless if you're autistic, loveless sex may as well be masturbation. I'm not bragging. I want to talk about my experience with people who have it similar to me. You can participate too if you get over your seething at something out of our control

You would never, in a million years, choose to be an ugly autist over an attractive one. Kill yourself

I'm not complaining about anything since being an ugly retard is so much worse.
However, I totally understand this feeling anon.
Especially when it's people like us.
They want a fucktoy that says nothing.

You boring normalfaggots can easily find a gf online.
Also, you'd kill yourself in less than a week if you were ugly.

My mom died at 15, my father was barely there. I have bipolar. I have failed every relationship I have ever started. People only use me when I'm having a manic episode to be happy around.
It's not any fucking better being attractive. Attractive to who? The fucking scum of humanity? Why do we even want anything to do with these fucking farm animals.

I would do anything to have a family man.
I would disfigure my whole fucking face.
I don't have anyone.

Yes it is, and by a huge margin. You never have to worry about being unloveable, about being attractive, about having to die alone, etc. because relationships and sex are handed to you pitifully easily if you have an IQ higher than 75.
If you were ugly then you would've been completely alone your entire life, you likely would've been bullied to varying degrees, you'd be an untouched KHHV, and you'd have no prospects for anyone liking you ever, really. You'd be dead by your own hands by now or shortly.

Well duh. Once you have a relationship for life you don't need looks except to entice your partner I guess.

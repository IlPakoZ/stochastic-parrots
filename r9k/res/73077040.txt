Has anyone seen the trailer for this new Cleopatra show being made by Jada Pinkett Smith? Apparently, this old lady's grandmother saying Cleopatra was black is solid evidence that Cleopatra was black, when in reality she was Greek/Macedonian. Really sick of companies like Netflix being allowed to rewrite history.

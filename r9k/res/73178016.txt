Gee thanks for your wise advice you fucking retard. God I hate normies.

I mean, he's not wrong. What's the problem?
How bout you be more specific you fucking useless faggot. How should I change my diet? Just eat less? Specific foods I should eat?
Just because he's fit doesn't mean he cares about teaching fitness. Do you want people to come to you with their math problems all the time if you're good at math?
He didn't give me any concrete examples of exercises I should do. He just said "work hard bro".

You are and always will be a faggot.
If you're still here. I'll try to make it brief.
Weight lift and if youre already active in a sport that isn't weightlifting try to do weightlifting sessions 2-3 times a week.
Your lifts will consist primarily of compound lifts including: squat, deadlift, bench, and variations. 
Eat enough protein which is .7 grams per kg or pound. I'm not sure
If you want to improve flexibility and prevent chronic pain look up kneesovertoesguy.
Exercising every day is suicidal unless you're on steroids like your co-worker probably is. Look into PPL splits or start a calisthenic program. Train 3-4 times a week at most, eat protein rich food (meat, fish, dairy, eggs, protein bars, whey) and track your progress.

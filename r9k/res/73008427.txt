Any other anons got toxic traits? I'll go first
Be me
Addicted to calling into Children's Hospitals
Turns out you can just ask to talk to kids who are terminal and "give them encouraging words"
Staff is usually extremely happy and more than willing to patch you through to a room
Every time a kid answers the phone I say horrible things to them
Everyone will forget about you in a week, your parents don't love you enough to fix you, you're going to die in your sleep, ect. then hang up
Keep calling into the same hospital and usually get three or four kids before they catch on
I get so much serotonin from this it's unreal

OP here, I also love calling hot steamy gay phone sex hotlines after I do this and tug my tiny black female penis to the mental image of kids suffering

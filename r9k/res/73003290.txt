Would you impregnate a black woman as a white man?
<comment>
Yes? What a stupid question. I'd impregnate almost any women. There's a big difference between impregnating a woman and starting a family with one. We live in an age of single mothers. Spread your seed lads.

I kind of just want to have a cozy little talk with someone about the good genes of all the hapa babies I want to knock them up with heroic#9589

I fantasise about impregnating all sorts of women but ideally I wouldn't because I don't want to abandon a child to being raised by a single mother
<comment>
Why yes, in fact, I intend to. Not because she's black, it's just that she's also the love of my life.

It's kind of crazy that the hottest black woman in porn, Maseratti got bleached and impregnated by a white guy

No, because I don't like women. I'm fine with black people tho.

Single dad raising a half black daughter. Can be weird at times because people assume she's not mine, that I kidnapped her or something.

I love ethiopian women and would gladly keep one as a baby factory though they wouldn't consider themselves as "black" in the same way that amerinogs and bantus do

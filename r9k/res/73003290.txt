Would you impregnate a black woman as a white man?
Yes? What a stupid question. I'd impregnate almost any women. There's a big difference between impregnating a woman and starting a family with one. We live in an age of single mothers. Spread your seed lads.

I kind of just want to have a cozy little talk with someone about the good genes of all the hapa babies I want to knock them up with heroic#9589
I fantasise about impregnating all sorts of women but ideally I wouldn't because I don't want to abandon a child to being raised by a single mother
Why yes, in fact, I intend to. Not because she's black, it's just that she's also the love of my life.
It's kind of crazy that the hottest black woman in porn, Maseratti got bleached and impregnated by a white guy
barely, asians whatsoever...
I did already yeah
No, because I don't like women. I'm fine with black people tho.
Single dad raising a half black daughter. Can be weird at times because people assume she's not mine, that I kidnapped her or something.
Tell us more anon.
I love ethiopian women and would gladly keep one as a baby factory though they wouldn't consider themselves as "black" in the same way that amerinogs and bantus do

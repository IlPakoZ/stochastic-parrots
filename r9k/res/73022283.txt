What are anons thoughts on Ai? Will we ever get anything meaningful for us out of it?
So far it already archived a netgain
wokie artists push the dialect like everyone else. something weird about all consuming the same things. i refuse to contribute data
tical
dialectical
word s
I really dont think your type of people are making ai just saying
It's a demonstration of what people will do. They have to keep deconstructing it as fast as they construct it because it's used for either politics or porn.
Considering that AI is machine learning, which is literally just recreating neutrons in a computer and then randomly rearranging them with training data it is safe to say that AI will one day be able to do literally anything human can do, the only question is how long until it does whatever task you think of. From recent advancements we could get AI that can do every cognitive task in 5 years, or we find some hurdle that becomes impossible to move past and we get it instead in 30 or 50 years. Either way it still devalues aspects of humanity and make rich richer and middle class poorer as it automates away high-skill expensive labour and saves employers money.
It will accelerate UBI and the end of work. How quickly that happens depends on the level of social unrest and how greedy people who are relatively high status want to be.
 depends on the level of social unrest
Check
And check
It will create a schism in art: one side will be AI slop churned out at a rapid rate to placate the masses; and the other will be human art created by talented individuals to express their personality and worldview, which will be appreciated only by an elite few.
you'd be very surprised
that would be kind of cool. like if there was like a black market for art
not that i am against ai as a creative tool. just social darwinist types who think everythings about making humans obsolete
Try me I am very curious to hear what you have to say

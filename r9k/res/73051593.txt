be me
eating dinner with my wife and her long-time atheist friend
religion comes up, we talk about believing in God and how he saved us
friend looks visibly uncomfortable
alone with a guy my wife went to school with when she leaves to go to the bathroom due to awkwardness
"i mean, of she were my wife, i'd believe in God too"
sounds like a joke but there is so much pain in his eyes
my jaw drops
say nothing until wife comes back
carry on like nothing happened
What would you do, robots?
*if she were
does he use reddit by any chance?
As a matter of fact yes, lol.
what a surprise!!! i could have never guessed, did that come up during conversation or something?
No, we just all have each other's reddits.
While he is a beta retard that would compromise his actual beliefs for a woman, youre also delusional and couldnt begin to hope to justify your belief in the supernatural beyond appealing to faith
I think he meant more like he thinks her being his soulmate would evidence God somehow. 
Most intelligent believers know you can't prove God and several holy books say faith is a virtue for a reason. Some people need personal, emotional evidence though.
personal, emotional evidence
Thats all well and good, but thats not actual evidence for the supernatural. Its not differentiatable from imagination, unless you also believe dmt trips and NDE's are sufficient as well
I didn't say it was. He did.
we talk about believing in God and how he saved us
U are extremely mentally ill
he lets his wife have male friends
lmao

Actions speak louder than words, and your actions suggest you like said generic chad jocks.
Because they want to stay in their easily understandable bubble instead of realizing that reality is nuanced and that maybe they are part of the problem. What kind of guy do you like op
Its more than a good sample size. Simple fact is if more of you did use apps, you would go for the same type of men.

My experience has been that toilets don't give a shit about me as a person. 
Toilet finds me repulsive:
you play the guitar? that's cringe 
Toilet finds me attractive:
Conclusion: toilets only "care" about you when they find you good looking. Yes, I agree that you don't have to be the generic chad to be considered good looking, but you still have to be facially attractive in some way.

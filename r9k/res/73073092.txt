Meaghan is all I care about I don't know how to contact her but I've sent a few letters in the mail to places I know I'm waiting for that message I can't understand why she hasn't talked to me in the last year I won't give up
<comment>
wait wait wait, you're just sending out random letters hoping one of them will make it to this chick? that's the craziest thing I've heard all day
<comment>
think about it this way, it's so crazy, itll only work on an equally crazy person.
then they meet their match. for better or worse
<comment>
Take a hint, bud. Sage

I'm not sending them randomly I've met her at different places she's lived with family and I sent the letters there since I don't know how else I can even contact her. She might even read this thread and I wait for the day to receive a real reply

who meaghan
<comment>
I'm scared that she might be dead her phone stopped working and everywhere else I try to look online knowing she would have to be there there is no response I'll keep trying until I can get back to her, I promised her I would always ALWAYS look for her. Things need to be made right again

Meaghan is the love of my life and I haven't been able to talk to her at all since the last night I saw her she wouldn't talk to me and it was a really dumb thing to even happen there's no reason for us not to talk about it together now
<comment>
Being together for 2 years just to suddenly lose complete contact with someone who days earlier wanted to marry me
There's no fucking hint of anything we loved eachother for so much and I will continue until I finally get to talk to her nothing else in this world matters
<comment>
when do you think she will add you back? 2024? 2026? 2035? 2060? how many years will it take you to realize its over and emotions are fleeting
<comment>
Emotions don't go away 2 years together is basically saying a whole lifetime will be full of these feelings and they don't go away even if she hasn't said anything I'll send letters and keep reaching her until the day we are reunited forever
<comment>
talk about wat
<comment>
if she likes you so much why isnt she reaching back out?
<comment>
Everything that happened. Me not even realizing what she was talking about when she said what if someone died... until months later cus she didn't even say anything she was talk8ng about and everything else that we would need to talk about and bring happiness together 
I know her and it takes time for her and that's OK

go hang out with friends
two couples amongst our friend group
first couple is completely normal, they chill and actually contribute to the group
second couple is PDA up the ass, hugging and kissing each other and shit
witnessing it is fucking nauseating and makes me feel empty inside
realize i genuinely hate seeing people happy
what do i do anons, this situation fucking sucks, how mentally ill am i?

that sounds completely normal anon, when you are single looking at couples hurt

ive talked to a bunch of other people and they say they don't feel the way i do, so either my feelings are amplified, i'm fucked in the brain, or they're liars

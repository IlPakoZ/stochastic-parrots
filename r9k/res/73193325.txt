<comment>
I am not. Probably closer to autistic than normal though. I do not want to be homeless frens
<comment>
i'm under the impression that a lot of robots have worked out at some point and probably even gotten decent gains for the time exercised but everyone fail because sticking to something for longer than a month or two is hard. 
hope i can find some way to make this work tho so i can mog people at the beach and make girls thirsty by looking at me without my shirt.
<comment>
pretty much. although i was able to stick to it for about 6 months. felt great and lost 80lbs. then i realized nobody cared and that working out isn't a magic portal into getting a social life or a girlfriend.

I'm autistic, and have been officially diagnosed with autism.
I'm not officially unemployed, because to be officially unemployed according to government definitions of the term, that usually means you must have attempted to find work within the last 2 weeks. This is why the unemployment rate means absolutely nothing, cause they don't even count the millions of NEETs.

if you don't mind me asking, how much are you getting in neetbux every month? and do they provide you housing?
<comment>
We're working on getting that within the next few years. Right now I just live in my parents' apartment and eat their food.
<comment>
did you get abs tho?
<comment>
no i was still skinny fat.
<comment>
is this the case with almost all the neets here? i was under the assumption that most of you were diagnosed with something and were on disability. basically you're bragging that your parents are nice and don't charge rent, because otherwise you'd be homeless.

I am a 22 year old college sophomore majoring in finance
I wasted the last academic year and didn't get any classes finished. Wasted my parents money. The people I graduated high school with are graduating college now albeit I saw on linkedin a fair amount of them did the easiest degrees you can get like communications or agricultural business (weird). Some did marketing. Meh. Only a few people I knew went for the tough degrees. A few other guys I knew who were chads also did finance and joined fraternities and are now graduating and about to make lots of money and here I am stagnating. Fuck life. People will say "you can only blame yourself" over and over again but it just isn't true. I tried and put in tons of social effort. I had my balls busted every single time and now I'm fucking my life up. 
I want to kms

P.S. my only hobby besides weightlifting (which isn't even a hobby) is staring at the wall in my apartment and browsing 4chan

I'm not bragging, you asked. My impression is that there are lots of NEETs who live with their parents here, with varying degrees of disability versus simple laziness, shyness, or addiction which is the main problem for them. Most just subsist off of family support, which can be just sleeping on the couch and eating the food in the fridge, or being set up with a trust fund allowance and inheriting the house. Me I'm somewhere in between. To get disability benefits you have to have lots of evaluations and get legal help and lots of paperwork and waiting time. My parents aren't evil assholes who would make me leave before I have my own place, but if there is an emergency I have the numbers of agencies who can find me places to stay better than a homeless shelter, and other family I can crash with.
I get abs just by doing standing crunches, like putting my hands on my shoulders, elbows out, and bringing the knee up to the opposite elbow.

... would he be able to be horny enough to bang adults?
Stopping porn will most likely help. If it doesn't and you can't control your urges go to therapy.
no, but the fact that you're asking is pretty strange.
I don't care about your masturbation habits. Kys nonce
I'm a different type of weirdo, I'm into momcest because I have mommy issues but since I researched the root cause of my own messed up stuff I ended up interested in paraphilias in general so that's why I'm asking this
If someone with a serious paraphilia such as pedophilia can have sexual relationships if he doesn't masturbate then it means I might stop thinking about incest when it comes to sex, I don't want to rely on my fantasies to get hard
Yeah I don't know if that outburst would be directed towards adults if they were exclusive
Pretty sure that would be something like turning to "prison gay" where you will start getting horny for the slightest feminity you could find but not full blown homosexuality or taking it in the ass. I would say pedo would be able to get the point where he jerk to larp porn like those made Japanese with really short and childlike women to cater to pedos.
Actually the opposite 
99.9% of pedos don't actually like kids and just enjoy feeling dirty or breaking le societal boundaries 
When you realize just how awkward and boring it would be then you'll be fine 
btw do le therapy and all the other stuff and take le pills and pls don't forget your 8 hours of sleep and working hard for your government and fellow people so that you can afford your own house and keep the housing market afloat

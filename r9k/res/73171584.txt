how do I be sexy?
granted I'm not attracted to men, but imo hans is repulsive but magnus is handsome
being sexy will most likely not help you become the best in the world on something
this is a common mistake that people make when considering whether or not they should be sexy
they see people who were born with extraordinary gifts (because humans are random chemicals jizzed together by horny humans and sometimes it makes genetic anomalys like albert einstein and magnus carlsen and leonardo davinci)
who can work in ways other humans cannot because they are gifted
and people who are considering whether or not they should be sexy think hmm these people are the best in the world and they are not sexy so that means WE dont have to be sexy
NO
you should want to be sexy because you are not a gifted anomaly or you would have known whether you had a shot on being best in the world before graduating high school and the only reason you would want to be best in the world on anything is an interest in becoming more suicidal

You won't get that in America, you either need to find an Islamic wife and become a Muslim or you need to find yourself an Eastern European woman who hasn't been westernized. Belarus, outside of Minsk in the smaller villages you will find lots of women looking for men to marry and serve. You would have to move there, but if you have Western money you'll be rich as hell. For example a small Cafe, food is around $2 for a full dinner plus bottle of homemade potato vodka. The hot Belarusian women will serve you like they used to do in America before they became fucking worthless fucking useless females.

"how much is a jaw surgery to make it come a bit forward cost?" 
How over is it when your own mom and dad are willing to pay for your receded chin surgery

if you do steroids doesn't that make your jaw grow?

I did hear cortisol and testosterone are directly related to chin size (hence why some strong ass chinned people get receding chins when they get older)
I mean I could just do nofap for that, but I would have to be horny all the time either way of I take steroids or I stop cumming. It's all fucked. I noticed my chin gets significantly smaller if I fap like 6 times a day for a week, and I am also tired as fuck so i am sure it all relates to the endocrine system

6 times a day for a week
You found your cause

Shit. I read like 5 articles before like how jaw size is directly associated with testosterone. Now I also remember movies trying to convey someone is a loser virgin, they always pick a small chinned guy.

Your parents don't want to see you hate yourself so they're offering to help. Tbh its not much different from getting braces. Its current year you don't have to play the hand god dealt you

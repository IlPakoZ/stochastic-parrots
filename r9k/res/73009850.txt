Tard stories thread? I'll start
Be me in middle school
There's a tard who we'll call Travis
There's also an autist who we'll call Brandon
Travis is wheelchair-bound and I've never heard him say anything beyond a few grunts
Brandon is high-functioning, but has anger issues and is known for lashing out violently
Brandon, Travis, and I all share a homeroom class
For some reason my school puts the tards in normal homerooms before sending them to the sped room for the rest of the day
One day, Brandon brings his DS to school

Some fatass bumps into him and makes him drop it
Travis's ends up running it over with his wheelchair
Brandon, as he's known for doing, lets out an autistic screech that could bring down the walls of a fortress
Lunges at Travis, but is held back by a wrangler
Over the next few weeks, he acts really pissed all the time
Always staring at Travis, as if plotting revenge
One day, he punches him in the face and gets suspended
A few days later, he comes to school with a fucking gun, I don't even want to know how he got it

Think he's either gonna go on a rampage or an hero right in front of everybody
Start saying my prayers since Brandon and I have never exactly been on the best of terms
Turns out, I was wrong on both of those options
Brandon goes right up to Travis and points the gun right at him

Travis, as if he knows what's going to happen, releases his only method of defense
Proceeds to take the foulest shit I have ever witnessed right then and there
Legends say that if you go within 10 miles of my hometown you'll still smell it
So rancid that Brandon instantly drops his gun
He's restrained by the SRO and eventually the cops take him to juvie
Travis is something of a celebrity for the rest of the school year
Last I heard, Brandon is in the psych ward
Find out later that I was indeed on Brandon's hit list
Thanks Travis

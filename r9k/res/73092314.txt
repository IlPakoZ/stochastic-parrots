Anons, why don't you just charismamaxx? 
Looksmaxxing can only go so far and careermaxxing just means slaving away your entire life. Why not just charismamaxx and get girls simply by talking?
<comment>
Your "charisma" is just your looks. If you're ugly, you're a creep at worst and a pitiful friend at best to women
<comment>
Because charismamaxx get's you friends, not girlfriends or lovers (unless you are attractive, and if you have that, you don't need much charisma beyond the bare minimum)-
<comment>
fippybippy, charismamaxxing does absolutely nothing to get toilets
<comment>
wrong. im ugly and in high school my friend would ask me all the time to get a girl's number for him because they always gave it
<comment>
Low charisma cope, notice how it's always the most vile and abrasive robots who insist that only looks matter, since they never want to look their own personality in the face. 
Real charisma gets you lovers too. If you're 'charisma' only gets you friends, then you're thinking of charisma in the same way that 'nice guys' think of kindness. It's not supposed to be transactional or have intent other than just enjoying the moment. If you're overly mechanical about it or overly cautious, you will fail. Girls just want to feel good, not be with a mechanical guy.

The problem is that women arent willing to talk to me in the first place, since I'm ugly.
<comment>
it's not possible to develop charisma even if you're ugly, it's just inborn. you have a genetic excess of mirror neurons and pheromone glands that enable you to model charming behaviour and set fellow humans at affable ease. there's no way for a sperg to learn it, it'd be like a chimp learning how to talk

You already failed at step 0 with this mentality. Women don't talk to guys because they don't have to. Even the most plain, passive, shy woman will get a bf eventually through shear luck and chance. For better or worse, it's up to the guy to approach in the vast majority of cases. If you aren't good looking and shy as a guy, it's basically a death sentence for your dating chances unless you get lucky.
<comment>
I do approach, they aren't willing to have a conversation. If I could show women who I am as a person I know I could get a gf, but no women have ever given me this chance.

 Girls just want to feel good, not be with a mechanical guy.
If you are fun, interesting and easy to talk to, they will just have you as a friend and save the role of partner for someone that is attractive, wealthy or high status (or even better: all 3).
<comment>
So did they date you or what?
This is absolute copium. I've had girls like me on the internet before I show face
<comment>
me on the bottom who on the top??
<comment>
Correct, and what's mindblowing is that getting enough sleep is actually a very important part of charisma. It's amazing how much better an impression you can make on others when you don't seem very stressed out and nervous all the time.

I am fucking autistic and depressed. I just cant muster the willpower to engage in small talk for more than 30 seconds, and im not interested in anything as a hobby. Even if i gained the willpower to increase my social skills tenfold, if i got a woman she would just find out how empy i am.
<comment>
You go to the gym to get better looking, you go to clothing stores to get better fashion, where do you go to get better charisma?
<comment>
charisma is unconscious, natural... you cannot learn or teach it.. It's just as genetic as your face or height

OP's guide on how to get charisma:
<comment>
Anon, the zoomies call it "rizz" now days. Charisma is an old person word.

there comes a time in a man's life when he is entitled to use words that come in a dictionary to say what he means

Unironically just talk to girls online, through 4chan meet girls, then talk to them on discord, preferably 1 on 1, and preferably through voice chat. That is the fastest way to learn. A few years ago I couldn't even talk to my female relatives, now I can successfully flirt with cute strangers with ease. I'm not even joking, you can learn this shit. Most anons are actually pretty funny and witty, they are just held back by their intense anxiety. 
If you do exposure therapy with yourself, but instead of doing it like someone would if they were afraid of spiders, do it with talking to girls, you will naturally become desensitized and better at talking to them. The best part is, it becomes fun, and you both enjoy talking to each other. It's a positive spiral, since the better you get, the more affirmation you get, the more you want to improve etc. In the same way that a 5/10 using Tinder can crush his soul into 1,000 pieces, this can do the opposite if you keep at it. 
See above
<comment>
Honestly I was half asking seriously because I fall into the "average guy whose soul was crushed by dating apps to the point where he avoids women" so I wasn't actually expecting good advice here
<comment>
Well it's too bad you got some then, would be a shame if you used it to improve your life.

Flirting is just teasing a woman. If you can tease a woman, making her smile and not come across like an asshole... Congrats! You're flirting. It's ridiculous that people pretend like it's some secret technique. Basically toned down banter that you'd have with your mates. Obviously reskinned to be appropriate to her specifically. 
The way to be charismatic is person is a mix of conversation control and body language. Body language means looking at her eyes while she talks, smiling (with your eyes dumb robot), and even looking at her mouth when you want to signal attraction. Making physical contact means touching as you'd touch a friend you know. Bump shoulders, touch their arm to get their attention. Playful punches when they make a joke at your expense. 
Conversation control is the ability to make a conversation engaging. Ask open ended questions that get them to open up more. Instead of "do you like your uni course/work?" Which encourages a Yes/No response (unless she already likes you) Instead ask "what inspired you to pick that degree at uni?" 
As she starts talking about herself more remember to verbally and physically signal you are paying attention. So eye contact and "oh wow," "that's interesting" and "I can't believe it!" During this part you can branch a conversation out more by asking for more details on what she has been saying too. 
You do need to know how to use your voice here to make a conversation exciting and engaging. Speak faster and with a higher tone when signaling excitement and interest and more slowly in a deeper tone when trying to show you're emotionally invested if she says something sad. Notice the difference if you say "Oh God that's awful" fast and slowly, and in a light or deep tone.
When you talk about yourself and your interests you NEED to speak with energy and excitement. It makes even your lame interests seem more interesting. Don't be all, "Yeeeah, I like video games..." You need to speak quickly and have some depth.

I did this already, maintaining relationships requires near constant maintenance and mask wearing. It's fucking exhausting and none of those people are even around me anymore. I wasted so many years being good to those people and they're fucking gone. Charisma maxing is like trying to trap water vapor in a room. Fucking pointless.
<comment>
I bet you aren't even ugly, fucker
<comment>
This anon understands is pretty well, but I'd caution making it too mechanical 
Don't wear a mask then, ti's not as simple as wearing a mask or not. If you tone down the self monitoring, then it won't feel like a chore. 
I'm average looking at best.

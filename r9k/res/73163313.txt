You cant live forever you will have to die eventually no matter how much you push it to the back of your mind and try to forget about it your body will decay just the same and you will eventually die.
No amount of exercise,diet,suppliments,copium etc. will stop it.
Isnt it just better to accept and desire something achivable like death instead of trying to gaslight yourself you will live forever if you just dont admit you're getting older and will die eventually?
Mental illness, self preservation, blah blah blah.

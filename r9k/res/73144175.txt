For me, it's boron, enclomiphene, l-arginine, phenibut, pygeum, saw palmetto, zinc, and I just ordered some dutasteride to get ahead of possible future balding, plus I drink bottles of Ensure for easy calories / protein and basic nutrition coverage.
just finished watching a video about this. what benefits do you see taking it? what does it help?
Ensure is literally basedbean goyslop
Boron, l-arginine, pygeum, saw palmetto, and zinc are all for increasing ejaculation.
I don't have a gf right now and am not dating but I like getting good volume when I cum.
Enclomiphene raises testosterone and sperm count through blocking estrogen.
Phenibut helps me relax and sleep (it's similar to benzos like xanax but not as potent and eaiser to buy online).
It's great. It tastes like milk but gets you way better nutritional coverage and you can use Ensure Plus for like 350 calories per tiny bottle, very helpful if you're like me and tend towards skinny. It's what they put people on in hospitals to get their weight up and it's helped me stay at a normal bodyweight.

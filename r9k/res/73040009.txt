imgur committing seppuku
I beg your pardon?
Ah, going the tumblr route. Many such cases as payment processors are retarded/malicious and/or CEOs/boards are braindead.
Oh.
Uh, bye bye porn, yet again, for like the 50th time since Tumblr.
I'd make some grandiose faggy speech about free speech and porn and all that, but I'm tired. I'm running on fumes anyway and I don't see a valid solution to life beyond The End level of Minecraft.
wow, loving this so far! so many interesting and cool images to discover!
I'm slow so oopsie doodles.
Payment processors are managed by diversity hires and they want children recruited ASAP, so no porn rn.
CEOs are looking into how to appease Sponsors
That's what it comes down to.
Yeah, it's all so tiresome in the end though. People quickly learn how devastating that can be for their service one way or another. Also payment processors are partially politically motivated these days, so you better not go against [current ideology] (^:.
Ah yes, another website about to experience the consequences of a monetized and sanitized internet!

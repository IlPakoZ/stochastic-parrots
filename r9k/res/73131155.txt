Do you not see the board's name is Robot 9001? Why do you think the shortened version isn't /r9k1/? Perhaps there was a precursor which reflected the 9k value?

In other words, a biased researcher , with a hard on for communism and socialism, rated the most commie boards on 4chan, particularly the ones known for creating and achieving nothing of significance outside of feeling superior and/or one or two decent threads ever, higher than boards like /biz/, /g/ or /fit/. Let's have a thought experiment here. List all of /sci/'s and /lit/'s achievements and exploits, and then see how they stack against other boards.
Inb4 it's 4chan we all use other boards retard
inb4 it's only rating the capacity to maintain and/or engage in highly intellectual discussions
The first should reflect on those boards from time to time, and the second is literally a statement to how important sophistry is to both the researchers and the board itself.

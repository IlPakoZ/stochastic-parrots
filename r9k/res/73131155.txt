The chart may have been created while /r9k/ was shut down or before it was created
When was it shutdown and why
No
~2011 and because moot had common sense
Reading isnt hard anon
Do you not see the board's name is Robot 9001? Why do you think the shortened version isn't /r9k1/? Perhaps there was a precursor which reflected the 9k value?

In other words, a biased researcher , with a hard on for communism and socialism, rated the most commie boards on 4chan, particularly the ones known for creating and achieving nothing of significance outside of feeling superior and/or one or two decent threads ever, higher than boards like /biz/, /g/ or /fit/. Let's have a thought experiment here. List all of /sci/'s and /lit/'s achievements and exploits, and then see how they stack against other boards.
The first should reflect on those boards from time to time, and the second is literally a statement to how important sophistry is to both the researchers and the board itself.
False, lies.
That graph glows strongly.
kek, that's some strong bait

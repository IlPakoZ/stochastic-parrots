Daily reminder that God hates wizards and witches.

Would he prefer it if I became a celibate Medieval-style monk type instead of a wizard?

be me
parents don't let me watch/read Harry Potter growing up
As a kid, it kind of sucked
Stopped caring after a certain point
Look back now
Everybody who watched/read the books became obsessed with them
There were government funded harry potter reading promotions at most public schools
Cult-like behavior around the books, the author, the movies
Harry potter days at school
Harry potter class at college (not kidding)
Theme park
Merchandise
New HBO TV show
Increase in 'real' witchcraft books (Even though, I consider HP real witchcraft
Become thankful for my parents who were wise enough to see through the illusion of it 'just being a kids book'

Order estrogen from the internet if you want the effects of it and are fine with the things men would generally find negative (like penis shrinking).

Do you really believe in your advice? Do you think that'd work after thinking about it a second time, this time more carefully?
im not sure if he wants a girlfriend or a whore
idk man
im not sure if he wants a girlfriend or a whore
That's a fair question. I don't know about him either. What if it's a girlfriend? I'm just quite curious because many girls have given a range of advice on this board before but it does not seem like the advice would actually even work on them, which makes me wonder why they would say those things in the first place.

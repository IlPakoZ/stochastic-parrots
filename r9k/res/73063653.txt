I'm not the guy asking for advice I just know a tranny when I hear one. Especially after that cough. 
I mean there's nothing with being trans, just be honest about it.

Order estrogen from the internet if you want the effects of it and are fine with the things men would generally find negative (like penis shrinking).

NTA but holy shit you're such a faggot.
"N-No, I want a girl to make me more girly..."
Just go buy a dress or something and live out your fantasy however you want.

Do you really believe in your advice? Do you think that'd work after thinking about it a second time, this time more carefully?

That's a fair question. I don't know about him either. What if it's a girlfriend? I'm just quite curious because many girls have given a range of advice on this board before but it does not seem like the advice would actually even work on them, which makes me wonder why they would say those things in the first place.

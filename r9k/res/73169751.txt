Eat shinji's flesh so I turn cute
<comment>
stop with the shinjixkaworu posting ffs, take me back to 2012 please
<comment>
Well I got the trash out at least... amazing how the tasks I did without complaint or being asked turned into this huge ordeal once mother was gone. 
One week I'm sure I won't take the cans out to the street simply because I won't feel like it. I need someone to keep me centered and doing basic stuff like that.
<comment>
take me back to 2012
So you can still see kawoshin? This is a kaworu neighboorhood faggot! keep walkin
<comment>
Shaved my face tonight to mark a weight loss milestone being reached. I've still got a while to go before I get back into dating.
<comment>
I talked to some faggot today and it made me super depressed knowing most people in the world are super vain and don't want intimate and meaningful relationships and only want short term dopamine hits. 
I'll try to keep on living for a few more years and if I'm still depressed like this I'll kill myself. it's not that I hate myself it's that I hate how the world is run. 
How is everyone today.
<comment>
How old are you and when is your kms date
<comment>
no fuck your ass, it is depressing weeb dream shit that is impossible to find, nobody will ever love and desire unconditionally like kaworu does.
<comment>
I am 18 I will do it in 4 years if things are still shitty. 
This makes me want to genuinely cry thinking about it.
<comment>
Would you date someone who is 4'9" tall?
<comment>
i'd never date a wojakposter
<comment>
dream shit
Uh yeah that's the point. That's the point of 2d posting in general. Its meant to be a look into an ideal world. There is a reason why people abandon 3d and only jack it to and watch 2d.
<comment>
that's why you deadass will date a virgin tho fr
<comment>
for me, it was marikxbakura. Pretty sure YuGiOh turned me gay.
<comment>
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one could love you like him
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that he's gone 
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile 
Don't show the world 
How alone you've become.
<comment>
Well anon im a year past your death date and i think life is swell. There's so much to craft and read in this world even if im alone in this journey
Yes but not you. I only date gemmy posters
<comment>
there's a shocking quantity of hentai that suggests you're not alone
<comment>
Those could be y i r cats nony
Do it so they have a comfier life
*hugs*
<comment>
what is this low quality pic.
<comment>
Gemmy ?
Houseki no kuni gemmy?
<comment>
It's more /qa/ wojak trash.
<comment>
Well i would date a HnK poster as well but i meant a REAL gemerald
<comment>
I am not 4'9", my boyfriend is tho.
Jelly much?
<comment>
uber jealous
<comment>
There are certain things that I've come to understand over the course of my life.
<comment>
can we kill this fucking avatar fag
for fucks sake!!!
if its not griffth its fucking kaworu or shinji
go back to molesting things i don't care about
stop molesting thing i like you fucking freak
<comment>
Get fucked.
EVA is horse shit
<comment>
my professional opinion? Contrarian.
<comment>
Your deeprooted opinion and love that can be crushed by a fag using shinji to blogpost
<comment>
Why do you hate me again? Can I ask?
<comment>
All i said is that he is molesting things I care about. Its like seeing a woman post about something you like online. Its gross and freaky. Of course you still like the thing however you don't like that the woman likes it. You feel me homie?
because you aren't interesting. You have no personality. Yet you insist on making yourself recognizable via avatarfagging yet you have nothing interesting to share. You're boring.
<comment>
honestly the inability to stay with one character is a red flag for me
if they get bored of perfect 2D guys so quickly a real life guy doesnt stand a chance
<comment>
I like how you made it extra clear with two examples -_-
lol for your connivence :D and to be thorough 
user name
Made me laugh
good :D i made new accounts for everything to be sure no issues were ran into
i'm also sure i won't respond to all that.
i find it difficult to talk in short bits, so i like the idea of being able to be as verbose as i want but dont expect reciprocation/ the only way id feel upset is if you were disrespectful in being purposefully short. but if you address only what you feel like and do it competently then i dont care, you can just address only what you want. you can do it here on 4chan or in a paste which you can do anonymously without needing an account. i just want one cause im like that. i put a little arrow in the index on the paste, thats the only section i wanted some response from, or i guess its a section im actually eager for that and picrel i guess
also
I don't feel like doing much these days 
I feel worse than ever and i there is no good solution for that if any.
check picrel
sorry if the font is jarring
i hope you feel better &lt;3
<comment>
I wanna be someone. Someday. 
Variety is the spice of life. (In terms of avatarfagging not with men)
<comment>
got guitar recently
already learned five (5) seconds of a song I want to learned
i am growing stronger
<comment>
what song are you going to play for us?
<comment>
TODAY IS GONNA BE THE DAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA THROW IT BACK TO Y-
<comment>
only when i have succeeded
<comment>
Are you from that /lgbt/ thread? I just posted there, then decided to check /r9gay/ and here you are, lmao.
Also, checked.
<comment>
are you from that /lgbt/ thread
No. i refuse to go there. I don't want to give trannies any of my time.
<comment>
Yup that's me.
Why do you care anyway.
<comment>
I cant get over the guy I dated 10 months ago.
I wish I wasnt such a bitter chronically online insecure weirdo when I was dating him
<comment>
This is basically me too. I feel you Anon. I would hug you.
<comment>
woah woah woah
dont spread misinfomation anon
I have never nor will i ever go to /lgbt/
<comment>
I stole your image sorry. 
Stop posting cute images!
<comment>
It's just that I'm in a similar position as you. Shit's fucked, what else can I say.
<comment>
Yeah you should totally date me Anony.
My stomach fucking hurts I need to shower. Got a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
<comment>
Does anyone here take pictures with a digital camera? Any tips on taking a picture with yourself in the frame?
<comment>
Stomachache? Yeah, you gotta get it checked and hope it's not something like an ulcer, because that shit's awful.
<comment>
Nah I just ate some nasty shit quickly and it has my stummy upset.
I got mild scoliosis apparently so that sucks. Need to get it checked out.
<comment>
I'm old and I want to die, but I don't want to die.
<comment>
how old is old
we talking 40s
<comment>
This made my cry because the coomer degenerate short term dopamine hit seeker is literally me. I wanted a long term meaningful relationship but I fucked it up by cheating ( long story ).
I met him in a video game and we instantly hit it off. We were unseperable for the first few weeks. He tells me he wants a long term relationship and doesnt like dating for no reason. Tells me he has trust issues from past bfs. I agree because I wanted a serious relationship for the first time in my life and ive never been close to anyone before not even family/friends.
He is basically a shutin like me so we spend all our time together. We would sext each other alot at first but he then he tells me He thinks he is asexual. And wants us to stop doing horny stuff all the time. I agree because emotional stuff is more important to me. 
Im the type of person who is really affectionate and he is more of a cold sarcastic type. I love lovey dovey stuff and puppy love type things (it was my first serious relationship). I would always say I love you and hugs. But he just wouldnt reciprocate at all and would call me weird and cringe.
Overtime time I get kind of fed up because I didnt feel loved. I always felt like he acted like he didnt like me. He never reciprocated my affection but he would spend alot of time with me. I was mad because it felt I liked him way more than he liked me. 
Eventually invites me to his discord with his friends and we play together alot. Always treats me like a simp and would always say things I didnt like " i dont understand why you love me". "Why are you with me ive never even showed you my face before" which was true. I sent him my pics and he did too but never his face. He even said to his friend im not all that.
I always questionned whether he even liked me and I felt lovesick all the time. There were days when he would get mad at me and I would be bedridden from the heartache. 
contd
<comment>
early 30s
i haven't a hope
<comment>
Anyway, being a distant e-bf is all I can offer, unfortunately.
<comment>
Why do people have upwards pointing eyelashes? I thought they were supposed to keep things out of your eyes, so shouldn't eyelashes be downwards pointing.
<comment>
sorry, bro. it's easy to get tangled up in a onesided relationship when it's your first nad you don't know any better.
<comment>
Are you the 28 year old Anon?
<comment>
you haven't a hope of what?
<comment>
same but i'm gonna get married at 38 and adopt a child with my future husband
<comment>
no. when something gets on your eyelash you blink, which shakes it free. if it was downward it would be more likely to be directed into your eye. the upward shape holds it. if they were straight it wouldnt catch anything, but going up it cradles it into a drop that is immediately dropped. as opposed to rolling into your eye
<comment>
That's me. I posted there again, so maybe I should move here instead of posting on two different threads, lol.
<comment>
My eyelashes point downwards and I don't have that problem.
<comment>
super weak after losing tons of weight
couldn't even do a push up
now im doing hundereds a day
im gonna get a qt bf i swear
<comment>
don't make him cry, when he's sad you have to love him.
<comment>
The only times he showed he cared about me was when he would get a jealous "vibe" from me with his gay friends. He would get sad and cry over me and we would have alot of fights only if something fucked up happened. Only then would he say He liked me.
He never acted like he liked me and so eventually his best friend starts dming me. Starts saying my voice is so hot and starts to flirt with me. And at first I was rejecting him telling him how im loyal. And I thought he was just testing me to see if i was loyal. But all the time he would flirt and say sexual things to me infront of me and my bf and also in dms. 
My bf and I never did anything together anymore so I was susceptible to his horny. I was mad that my bf said I wasnt all that so I sent him a pic of me. He said I was really hot. Still I resisted I said i only sent this pic to prove im not ugly (my ego).
I resisted for many days despite being horny and pent up all the time until one day. I said please stop I cant take it anymore especially because "bf" doesnt do anything with me anymore. And he said. Ik him for a long time I think he is Asexual. He just doesnt want anything with you sexually. And it clicked. I suddenly remembered He did mention that. And so I started sexting his best friend and I released all of my pent up affection into him instead of my bf.
I was mad because he acted like he didnt even like me or my affection. Would only act jealous and emotional if we fought or if I did something that seemed like I liked his friends. 
I justified it in my head by saying he doesnt even like me im just using his best friend as an outlet for my horny and affection. But I still Love him. He has my heart. 
After sexting his best friend for a couple days, I start thinking wait this is kinda fucked up what im doing I should atleast run this by my bf first. 
cont. Again
<comment>
I resisted for many days
You are a piece of shit for betraying your bf after only some days.
<comment>
No one cares nigga! God damn!
<comment>
Based trips
sexting a different guy instead of just jerking off or something
bruh
<comment>
t. weak men who couldn't hold a relationship with a cute boy
anon is in the right. his only mistake was doing that while still being with his ""bf"" instead of cutting his loser dorky "muh asexuality" ass, but i get it was his first relationship so don't judge too harshly.
<comment>
then youre wrong
also downward is relative, i was thinking anon was arguing the exact opposite we have now, where the eyelashes have an arch. and if the arch was pointing down it would lead to the eye itself. downward like in your pic seems like its own thing
<comment>
After telling him he breaks down crying saying how could I do this. I justified it saying he didnt even act like I was his bf. I felt really bad because he has trust issues about previous exes cheating on him. He tells me isnt Asexual. He gets horny alot but he doesnt want a horny type of relationship like that and wants something meaningful. Saying how he thought i was the "one". I started crying too because I did want all those things I just justified my fucked up thinking by saying he was asexual. And I honestly did screw up my relationship by not atleast asking him first because I was mad at his indifference to me.
I tell him im sorry and ill never do it again I fucked up I thought you didnt like me. Please ill never do it again I love you so much I thought it was okay because you were Asexual.
Doesnt dump me on the spot but a week later. Tells me. I just want to be friends. Were incompatible. Youre just so weird. Everything you do disturbs me. Youre clingy,posessive in a bad way. And youll just get horny for my friends if I dont do anything with you.
I tell him please dont leave me I love you. Ik I fucked up. Please dont go. Ill never do it again. I know what I did was fucked up. 
I knew we were incompatible but it still hurt so much. I wanted to work things through despite my fuck up. It was like my world was shattered. 
Im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry. I wanted a real serious long term thing not only 5 months. Im so lonely without him. I feel so alone. It was such a shock to me. We told each other we would meet and how id never leave him or each other. We use to spend so much time together in call. We even slept in call together. I felt my soul being so fulfilled loving htogetheI feel so alone.
Im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry please take me back ill do anything.

i will, i will just wait to be programmed again by DARPA i hate having free will
<comment>
come on, anon. that guy sounded like a socially stunted neglectful jerkwad. you sound like a good boy. keep your chin up, and know that you can do better than that. much better. you deserve someone who'll reciprocate every "I love you" with an "I love you more". I don't know you beyond the story you gave, but you don't seem clingy, obsessive, or weird. you seem like someone with a good heart and with a lot of love to give. I promise you that so long as you don't give up hope and keep the idea in your mind that you can love again, that you'll find a boy who'll take your love and give it back just as much if not more.
<comment>
5 months
how did i know at the end it would be a super short thing. if you fucked it up after only a few months how did you ever expect it to go long term. 
also lmao how did it take you 1 hour to write this out.
<comment>
wow thats so very cool
<comment>
don't make him cry
never
when he's sad you have to love him
but im gonna love him no matter what u ok?
<comment>
Storyanon how you doing man? How are you holding on?
<comment>
Are you sure you aren't the one who is vain and you're rejecting the people who are interested in having a relationship with you, while you only have eyes for the ones who don't?
I'm not the problem
Everyone else is
You have so much to learn. Such an inflated ego to deconstruct
<comment>
So you had a conversation with one gay guy who didn't want to date you... 
And what you take from that is "I hate how the world is run, nobody is worth my pristine love standards"?
Well this is the perfect board for you. Quintessential incel mindset. 
Have you ever thought that your one bad experience isn't representative of the whole? Or even, that the people who want committed relationships with you are flying under your radar for some reason? 
Do yourself a favor: grow up but don't let this board poison your mind more than what it already has
<comment>
tfw no bf to keep centered
<comment>
He's off his antipsychotics, probably going through a mental crisis.
<comment>
That's like a superpower in the dating game. You just upped your chances tenfold
<comment>
Don't worry, it wasn't a real relationship if it was all online anyway. 
Focus on your next adventure
<comment>
I took my meds today I'm all good homies.
<comment>
we spend all our time together
Literally two anonymous strangers who never met 
Anon, it wasn't even real
<comment>
what does it taste like, the pills
<comment>
Very plain. I take antipsychotics and antidepressants together everyday.
<comment>
Why are you with me ive never even showed you my face before" which was true.
It baffles me how you keep falling for these ambushes over and over again. 
How on earth can you say you have a "serious committed relationship" or that you love someone whose face you have never even seen before? 
Anon, get fucking real my boy
<comment>
My bf
You have some nerve calling someone you have never met before your "boyfriend".
<comment>
that's gross i would eat it with sugar
<comment>
Thank you for your words. Im literally crying rn.
Im a horrible person because I cheated on him when i used to say stuff like I would never cheat on you.I knew I was saying I love you way too early and it was a red flag but it was genuinely how I felt. I even said how I wanted to marry him.
I couldve atleast asked him but I was mad and embarassed about talking about that stuff with him since he didnt like it. It showed how I cant be trusted and I always fuck up. I wanna be a good person but this shows how im just a degenerate coomer >>73170888 he even got trips im the worst person in the world.
I dont care about porn or cooming. Its more about feeling loved. Im actually scared of sexting I only like the emotional part. And i dont like sending horny pics either.it stresses me out. Most of the time it was them initiating horny. 
Ive watched alot of porn and its not the same thing. I used his best friend as an outlet for my puppy love affection . I would say I wuv you and he would say it back too. And i was imagining it was him saying it back.
My bf told me. You only like fake disingenuine love and that made me cry because i just wanted to love and feel loved back. I wanted a long term thing i wanted to know him deeply. But i fucked it up.
<comment>
The fucked up part is seeing all the incels here jumping at your throat for "cheating" when you didn't really cheat because you weren't really in a relationship since these online flings are nothing but s fantasy. They aren't real, they don't matter. They're like a drug that keep you hooked online and detached from the real dating life you should be living 
He wasn't your bf. You weren't in a relationship. You didn't cheat. It's just a bunch of gay retards causing online drama. You deserve more than that. You deserve a real boyfriend in the flesh
<comment>
he doesnt want a horny type of relationship
Sexually repressed gay lets his sexual repression ruin his interpersonal relationships
Tell him about /r9gay/ he will fit in here perfectly
<comment>
tfw no bf that needs me to hide his meds in his applesauce
<comment>
Why are you beating yourself up for this fake relationship bullshit? It wasn't real, anon. None of it was. You never even met these people. Don't lose sleep over them, they're strangers on discord. He wasn't "the one". He wasn't anything. You don't even know his name or his face, thank god.
Don't leave me
He can't leave you: he was never there in the first place. 
You deserve so much more than this play pretend relationship.
<comment>
I feel so alone.
You were alone with him, silly. He wasn't there with you, ever. 
You didn't fuck up. This fake relationship was doomed from the start. Its end is a blessing in disguise. 
Now you are free to pursue something better than "dating" faceless strangers on discord 
We told each other we would meet
Biggest lie you have ever told each other
<comment>
We use to spend so much time together
In call
It wasn't real, anon. You need something real. You need someone who can spend time together with you irl, not just in a call.
<comment>
holy shit hue is freaking from that post. i think he posted 8 times without a reply already.
<comment>
ATTENTION EVERYONE
I have once again touched myself to a homoerotic video
<comment>
he likes to be thorough, which I can respect. some people need to hear this stuff
<comment>
hes been desperately trying to get attention all day
<comment>
You didn't cheat, anon. That wasn't a real relationship. It was just an online fever dream, nothing more. You deserve better. 
Wanted to marry a faceless strangers I never met before
Do you see how ridiculous it is that you have the same romantic aspiration as a Disney princess? Even Elza is mire reasonable than you. 
Don't let incels here call you a degenerate coomer. You are neither of those things. 
But you are dumb, that's for sure. Dumb for entering these failed anonymous relationships over and over again
<comment>
Ehem, i require a tribute from you anon. I am the gayknight of r9gay and i require the source as per policy (i don't make the rules)
<comment>
. I wanted a long term thing
You cant build those based on anonymity.
i wanted to know him deep
You can't do that online either
I fucked up
You really didn't. You're off the hook. You're better off now. You're free to pursue real relationships in real life, away from this cursed place and other anonymous online cesspools like discord
<comment>
Tried using some wax shit I bought from the store but it was too weak. I need the nair cream apparently. 
Also some tweezers for my eyebrows.
Gonna buy a bag and new glasses eventually also. Then I'm all kitted out.
<comment>
I just shave myself in the shower. so long as my butt and bits are smooth, I'm good to go
<comment>
What's the point in all that grooming if you're not going to show anyone? 
You should at least have an irl date so you can show your depilatory efforts to someone irl
<comment>
I just shave myself in the shower. so long as my butt and bits are smooth, I'm good to go
why do bottoms do this
<comment>
i'm a top. have you never shaved your ass? pooping becomes a much nicer experience when there's no hair in the way, plus I can grab my butt and it's nice and smooth
<comment>
are you grabbing your anus or something how does shaving change anything about the grabbing experience.
<comment>
I wish you would let another person grab your butt and feel its smoothness
Of course, all in real life
<comment>
Uh oh
I imagined myself on a warm beach there, with no worries and nothing but the sound of the waves, and almost started crying
Id better watch something that makes me cry later so I can get out some of that hidden tension
<comment>
a shaven butt is nicer to grab as it's smoother. that's my preference at least.
i do have someone to grab my butt, as do i grab theirs
all in real life
<comment>
Nigga is crying now, everyone can see he's depressed, and everyone can see why, except for him.
<comment>
Im a different poster hue, these feels arent bf related
Ive had a lot of stress the past few weeks and Im prone to just burying my emotions for later
<comment>
what part of your butt are you grabbing where shaving it even makes a difference. unless youre grabbing around your anus it's not going to matter.
<comment>
I wish you would share your butt grabbing stories with your butt grabbing companion more often, it would help to destigmatize this place as being inhabited solely by lonely celibates
<comment>
fag can't stop himself from being promiscuous
it's a discord ebf relationship
kek.
<comment>
never in my life heard a top call his cock and balls bits, i dont shave and wont, best ill ever do is trim. i made my bottom stop shaving after he shaved smooth for years and years
hair is just better, even on a bottom
<comment>
these feels arent bf related
Every feel you have is related to it, it's all connected in your mind. 
You know how much you need a bf
<comment>
you'd know if you shaved
i could, but i met them on /trash/, so i don't think that'd do your narrative much good
<comment>
Are your critical thinking skills the reason why you turned into a lonesome chud?
<comment>
that's fair. i have my boy keep their pubes a bit untrimmed as i like the look of it, but keep them shaved otherwise. as i said, i just have a preference
<comment>
I shave everything except my arms. Or at least try to. 
What about you r9gays?
<comment>
how can you even shave your butt without irritating the fuck out of your skin
<comment>
So you're saying you met your real life bf on /trash/ and you're together now, coliving and everything? How's that not perfect inspiration for people here? 
If only it was true
<comment>
everything except arms and face. i like feeling smooth and if i ever want to take lewd pictures i'm not going to be showing my face anyway. i'll look rugged at my job and a thin boi otherwise
<comment>
Too many bf havers ITT. Fleeing to tttt until it gets sorted out.
<comment>
there are even more bf havers there PLUS troons
<comment>
I've thought this exact way for about ten years since I was 18. Just want a loving relationship. Most people I've encountered can't be differentiated from wild animals. Mindless simpletons obsessed with social hierarchy and conformism. It doesn't really get easier, your tolerance for it just builds, like a drug addiction.
To answer your question though, anon, I'm doing better than I deserve, auck this gay earth.

won't be living together for another 10 months until the visa application is done. just taking a few vacations every year to see the other for a few weeks at a time visiting the other's respective country in the meantime.
if only it was true
<comment>
I shave and tweeze my face, my tummy trim my pubses
<comment>
Auck kek
<comment>
You stupid stone cold chudcel have SEX (with me)
<comment>
i don't really shave anything except my face anymore because i'm too autistic and touch my face too much to have hair there it bothers me.
i'm not very hairy to begin with but nonetheless i enjoy having goblinmaxxed pubes
<comment>
i don't know how true it is, but i've heard the more you shave the less irritable it gets. i've been shaving my ass for a long while and never get irritation
<comment>
pubemaxxing is fun until it gets stuck in your foreskin
<comment>
jewish doctors gave me the snip so i don't have that probelm
<comment>
Its made me colder, it makes me feel like I love too much and I fall head over heels over someone when I should just be cold and distant.
I know you guys are right and thanks for trying to make me feel betfer. 
I know e-relationships are cringe and that its not a good look. And that im stupid for saying I love you and bf to someone ive never met online. 
But ive always felt like a ghost. I didnt have any meaningful friendships as a kid so i desperately wanted to feel connected with someone and also being a loser shut in. So to me it was real. I loved his voice, his quirks. Everything about him even his bad points. How he would get frustrated at me sucking at video games. And I thought his jealousy was cute. Because only then he showed he cared abt me. I just have alot of love in my heart and I wanted to be loved despite being a shut in unsociable loser.
It still hurts how suddenly he says he doesnt like me for who I am. When we use to say how we would never leave each other. Its like I was in a warm hug and then suddenly im cold and alone all of a sudden. 
I get it though I need something real.

This is a subtle signal to attract kiwis isnt it

i'm just going to become a hecking chonker, fuck it
<comment>
wanting to love makes you human. you've learned though that you shouldn't immediately react when you feel that warmth that someone gives you. or, should I say, you should react, but not excessively. if someone shows interest, you should reciprocate if you're so inclined. but love is a dance, and its pacing is important. you can get closer to someone, say you really like them, but get to know them and enjoy those feelings without saying something that you don't know the gravity of. 
it's harder to do in the moment when you're feeling all that lovey gushiness, but you have to really consider the long term prospects of being with someone. if the thought of love or of a long term relationship crosses the mind, you have to really consider what that would look like. that's why time is important, as you can get clouded by the honeymoon period and energy of a new relationship. get to know them, and if the feeling mutually persists, then consider longer term options
<comment>
anon i love you, you cute bitch. you made a mistake but it's not unforgivable. i can tell that your heart is full of love and you're looking for someone to pour it into. you deserve someone better, someone who'll reply to every 'i love you' with enthusiasm. you made a mistake and it's important to learn from it, but what you did does make sense on a human level. god... i relate to this so much man. hey listen keep your head up okay? you're gonna make it, and don't e-date next time! it's only in very, very rare cases that it ends up working out!

dreamss
thank you for understanding! often times they aren't so peaceful... i get nightmares quite a lot, it's really fricky and they'll often screw my entire day up... when it involves a family member i always ask if i can give them a hug the next morning and they'll ask what the dream was about. it's nice to explain and get off my chest!
i think the reason i remember them so well is because i sleep very lightly if that makes sense. the slightest disturbance will wake me up instantly, so maybe that has something to do with it... but maybe there's something else yaa! would be kinda cool
mods
aaa sorry! you probably phrased it fine, i just didn't get it lol. command blocks, gotcha! that's very fun too! pretty impressive as well, i would have no idea where to start coding the lines...
4chan fbf
cool, and yesh i remember aa
vegan minecraft
okay anon i believe you i believe you hahah! thanks for all the farming tips, that's really smart! i really like farming in mc, it's so peaceful and relaxing! and i will not except your sorry, you didn't do anything wrong, i like to hear ramblings so keep being as autistic as you like ^^
skin
hmmm... a fairy sounds pretty cute! maybe i could even make my own skin, i've tried doing that before and it turned out pretty well. thanks for the tips i'll look into it :)
not everyone is into merciless tickling
:o well i'd really love it, it's like a cute and non-dangerous way of giving all control to fbf >&lt; nnggg i'd really like it if my nipples were played with... is that really perverted to want?
pajamas
oh no worries! i won't take a picture then dw :3
hope you slept well nonny! enjoy your day and drink enough water !

I will princess carry you and shoot the ride operator with my gun if he doesn't allow you on.
<comment>
i'm a prince not a princess
<comment>
They call it a princess carry but I will make exception and call it a prince carry, prince Anon.
<comment>
yay ty sir anon
<comment>
woke up a little closer to being thin again
we're so fucking back
<comment>
I am your knight by your side forever, prince Anon. And my duty is to love you forever unconditionally.
<comment>
Damn the Egyptians were all.... whyte kangs?

I can offer to be your e-bf prince Anon, but it's truly your choice and only one you can make.

No one is truly worthy of my love.
Good night.

friendly reminder to do your best today anons
<comment>
D: Nooo, you deserve as peaceful a sleep as it gets anon, not fair... But remember that they're just dreams, okay? It's just like a movie, no one gets actually hurt, everyone is only pretending and acting. Irrationally worrying about your loved ones is one of the most common anxieties to have out there, but despite it being #wholesome #100 try to not get caught up in it, or it'll start controlling you and you'll have no rest whatsoever! But I think you have it all under control, hugging the person involved and telling them what happened hopefully reassures you that everything is (and will be) a ok.
i've tried doing that before and it turned out pretty well
Color me impressed! I find it really cool when someone is artistic enough to make custom skins. And I know you're already pretty creative with your legos and stuff, so tell me, ever tried drawing before? How about an instrument? Maybe your journal skills could make for an excellent short story!
is that really perverted to want?
You know I'll say "yes" no matter if it is or not, right? :3
and drink enough water !
Never know if I do, but I like water.
And today's question of the day is: How many times do you get mistaken as a girl in public?
Something you said earlier got me thinking a bit. You mentioned everyone on 4chan having something wrong with them, and while I don't disagree why you, I find it hard to see what is so wrong with you nony?
<comment>
Im so sorry for mistaking you for my guy that was awful
<comment>
but i dont wanna anon
<comment>
I have no recollection of this whatsoever?
<comment>
that feeling is back
that feeling is back
once again i feel there is something missing and its impossible to go thirty minutes without thinking about it ruining my mood and disturbing my escape
<comment>
my best is not good enough but I will try
<comment>
i havent had this in awhile, very happy about it. thinking about it is kind of inducing it though
<comment>
Sometimes when it gets too much I remind myself of the "boysocks" principle:
boy
socks
<comment>
Speaking of socks I keep washing mine but I can't get rid of the boysmell... how do you boys wash your socks?
<comment>
Wow that 18 year old lurker sure is cute (;
<comment>
makes me want to cry. i know the reason is because ive exhausted my distractions, i need to do something new to keep my mind up. ive only made it worse taking a little trip to nostalgia for comfort since the comfort has been gone. i guess now i slowly build up to some idea of what will make my life have purpose, something that will not only distract me but fulfill me, and then quit doing that because its actually annoying, too much work for the rare reward. predictable script after the first four times AND still it goes
<comment>
tfw someone in my dream told me that I walk like I want to swallow a bag of dicks
<comment>
I can respond to pic rn. Yeah it's kinda true sure. But also the reason i've become like that is due to a lot of interractions that i didn't really want to have. I think i already said that irl interraction make me very anxious. More so now then ever, even with people i know since forever. I'd always rather be by myself. It's not just trying not to say something wrong and feeling bad physically though that's the main issue, it's also they are kind of boring. And i also don't have much to say either, if anything. Nor do i want to. So yeah. Venting online is much better. Plus i can sometimes talk with anons i have something in common and stuff. 
You are right about small steps and how it seems so hopeless or difficult. That's because it is. 
I will just say that now i have zero desire to work on anything or improve anything. I couldn't do it well enough for the one i loved, there is no way i can do it for myself. I'll live day by day until it gets too hard &lt;3
all i want is for him to be my bf again but since i know i would just drag him down and make him sad i won't try to contact him again. It's so hard. I'd want to talk to him so badly. I can't stop thinking about him. But if i really love him i have to do what's best for him and that would be leaving him alone. 
for your connivence :D and to be thorough
There really was no need lol
you address only what you feel like and do it competently then i dont care, you can just address only what you want.
Will do. Probably on paste i think. Not sure when :(
I'll try sooner rather than later
<comment>
awww thanks non, but most of the time i'll have a pretty good sleep don't worry! im more worried about you desu, you said you had pretty bad nightmares frequently :( do you often wake up in cold sweat because of them? bwah, i hope they'll pass in tim! 
creativityy
well it was a long time ago, but still i appreciate it! i do like being creative, yesh, but im not great at drawing unfortunately :( i have tremmers in my hands due to stress related issues and that makes drawing and keeping my hands still pretty difficult... regardless though, i do do it occasionally and try to get better! i'd love to be able to play music too but im not good at that at all sadly. do you play any nony? :D
i used to make stories when i was younger! im really embarrassed when i read them now but they were kinda cute back then ^-^ 
You know I'll say "yes" no matter if it is or not, right? :3
...sigh... yes i know is it though bunny aaa tell me, i dont wanna be a perv!
mistaken for a girl
it happens every once in a while, last time was at my church a few months ago, but i don't think i look like a woman, so i don't know why it keeps happening but i don't mind it desu
I find it hard to see what is so wrong with you nony?
i think my naivity, insecurity, upset with the way i am and le 'tism are some examples :D but im glad you still see me as pretty normal :3
<comment>
i'm not good with people, have never been good with people, and it'd be foolish of me to assume it would be any different in the arena of romance
<comment>
2012 was another good year, i watched a lot of cool movies, school was going great, some teachers really liked me and i kinda became popular as the "expert" on mma among my classmates. It helped that my picks were usually correct (one friend would bet without telling me and even made some money lol) and that i was strongest in the class when it came to wrestling ^_^
Enjoyed ballin' as well back then despite being mediocre at best. It was fun
<comment>
I remember very little of 2012 asides from sitting by myself in a classroom. I remember being okay with being alone and didn't realise what a mistake i was making.
<comment>
when i say you need to be less reclusive i dont mean you must have as many pointless conversations and suffer as much as possible, i guess you can take what i meant to mean as be less reclusive to life itself. scream in a hallway or something, commit a crime, call people slurs,kill john lennon do something that only a corporeal human could do- steal milk and feed strays. youre withering away because youre a candle running out of oxygen, spill over onto the curtain and burn the house down. the thought makes you apathetic but its what you need, what you want to do least is live; so even in apathy do something to live out of pure spite. you cant put your life together because the fragments dont exist
your spoiler
i cant comment extensively but i doubt he doesnt think about you a lot and i think if he knew you were getting your shit together he would wanna be with you. you should consider maintaining contact because im sure you both love each other a lot and if you ever are able to get stuff together you wouldnt feel like a burden and you could be happy together
Will do. Probably on paste i think. Not sure when :(
take your time &lt;3 lord knows i did 
also since you might not see it for awhile i recommended you watch the movie "master and commander" which i love/d and i just thought that you might like to be aware i recommended it right now. i actually think theirs some potentially prescient lessons for you in it &lt;3

I ate. Made some sausages for the second time in my life. Well, It's very simple and takes &lt;10min
mean as be less reclusive to life itself
This whole section cheered me up and made me laugh. Thank you
I didn't fully realise what you meant before, so i'm glad you made it more clear in this case :)
steal milk and feed strays
This is totally something i should do lol
live out of pure spite
People being mean to me or doing bad things makes me want to outlive them and metaphorically piss on their grave >:3
spoiler
i know he most likely does. I feel guilt over wasting his time. I'm also not sure what he saw in me. Even now when i see him awake at crazy times it breaks my heart. I could still message him but it's for the best that i don't. It's too complicated for someone like me to make it work. It's even worse since he wants to leave his country too so we would have to both get work vissas and stuff in order to live where we planned. It will be much easier if he is alone. I always doubted i could make that plan work. But after not meeting in 3 years and getting older i've lost almost all hope and it was clear to see. It just sucks. He doesn't want to be friends either and i understand that. I would be happy if i could just talk to him but ok 
I will add movies to my list, i already added more but i really don't feel like watching anything. I plan to do so but i just can't focus or manage my time well. I will watch them all at some point tho
It's been a long time since i got to pet a cat :(
Also tell me how to link my response and how to save it and stuff on paste. Not sure i would figure that out

No thanks. Anything between actual adults?
<comment>
yuri on ice
<comment>
actual adults
No. There is no market for anime about fully grown men in love. There is nothing wholesome about that. Young love has always been romanticized in media. Its viewed as more pure therefore more wholesome.
Its fine. Viktor makes me knob hard thats about it. The rest of the show is eh.
<comment>

Animan studios nigga
I havent even watched yuri on ice its just the first thing that came to mind which fit the criteria of adult romance anime.
Young love has always been romanticized in media
In anime in particular because its a massive cope tailored for highschool students or young nerd salarymen to escape their lives as shabbos goy

yeah, exert yourself onto the world. you dont have to be destructive or commit crimes, thats just a easy way to go about it
This is totally something i should do lol
you should! i knew youd like that suggestion

based
spoiler
why dont you message him and ask him if it would be alright to send gm/gn texts, if you agree to only ever say that then its no stress. usually people dont want to remain friends because its too painful. but if youre just saying gn/gm then you avoid a lot of the pain and its a purely positive gesture. you can show your continued love without causing guilt or stress
I will add movies to my list, i already added more but i really don't feel like watching anything. I plan to do so but i just can't focus or manage my time well. I will watch them all at some point tho
thats fine &lt;3 youll like the nautical one i think

<comment>
It's gone now :(
It was last thing he told me before we broke up, so yeah.. i'd say it's serious. I left it for an hour case i don't like leving it there for a while :)
you should! i knew youd like that suggestion
Hahaha ye
usually people dont want to remain friends because its too painful.
That's what he said and now you see why i can't message. It would hurt him. It would draw him into something where there is no good ending. I will have to learn to cope with losing him. Not sure what i would say if he messaged. I would hope it would be something silly that ignores the fact we didn't talk for a while now. Acting like it's just another day. That would make me burst out laughing and i would cry too. But like i said i don't think it can work in our situaton so it would only hurt after a while. He wouldn't like that gn/gm thing :(
We also ended on bed terms now so it would be weird for me to message back yet again.
thats fine &lt;3 youll like the nautical one i think
One day i will play all the games i want and watch all he movies from my list too

They aren't full blown nightmares most of the time, it's just that they commonly feature a bunch of stuff I find triggering, especially once I wake up. And I've only got jumpscared to the point of waking up a handful of times. But I do sweat a lot when I sleep, I think it's something to do with my medication.
Man sucks to hear about your tremors, you just can't seem to get a break, huh? ;-; Interestingly I once had them as well when I was still getting used to a particular antidepressant. But as I am someone to whom repetitive behavior acts in a self-soothing manner I found pretty neat :D But they eventually went away...
I don't know how to play anything either, but I do like music a LOT. Used to own a synthesizer once, but I didn't play jack on it desu.
perviness
Well it isn't that common among boys I think. Somehow they always neglect huge chunks of their body when playing :\ But it's much less deviant than wanting to get choked for instance. So it's just a tad bit fruity imo. So you shouldn't worry yourself with that, I would be much more concerned about the whole "giving up total control to fbf" thing >:3 I can't wait once you discover breath play! You little semen-demon :D (or would it be angel?)
your insanity
Don't get me wrong, everyone's feelings are valid, but your problems seem more teenage-girl tier rather than 4chan tier. But gatekeeping sucks so don't be discourage nony. Although don't let this place take a toll on you, monsters create other monster and so on ^-^
<comment>
sorry
It's ok. I like honesty
the door still seems open, whats stopping you?
Not after what happened later. It was before we stopped talking. It was a very stupid argument but it was more of an issue of me having a hard time improving and him being a bit colder towards me, tho he was still very sweet when i did a good job. Actually he tried to be nice still but it hurt he wasn't really interested in mundane, everyday talks like we used to have. He tried to motivate me :c
lol thanks
No thanks, it was a mistake ;-; i thought i clicked 1h dammit
im usually careful but sometimes im really not. but 90%
Maybe drinking lol
dont rush! dont let it be a mental drag!
It might bug me until i do it. Depends on how i feel as i seem to procrastinate everything these days. I'll try to answer as much as i can tho
i dont like being more specific desu
Neither do i! Believe it or not i used to be very careful about stuff like that. I didn't even talk about myself or my life at all (ok maybe occasional "i don't like my family or my life" thread or some shit, but even then it was very vague) nor did i have some more meaningful conversations before this year. I kinda gave up on the idea that i have much to lose, so it doesn't bother me to scream about my situation into the void or talk about it with someone when i feel like it or when someone will listen. I sometimes feel better after getting certain thoughts out of my head. Usually not ;-;
How are you doing btw?

the really hard thing about being gay is finding meaning in your life without family as an easy default option. you have to dedicate yourself to math or art or something gay and hard like that instead.

Just had a ruined orgasm instead of properly finishing. I was still trying but after a while I gave up.
The thing that sucks is still having the same allure towards fapping even though the ssris make it unbelievably hard to finish :(
Wish I just stopped doing it altogether desu
<comment>
do ssris also make it harder to get prostate orgasms?
<comment>
i think it's something that parents realize about their gay kids intuitively but that concern manifests as homophobia and a selfish desire for grandchildren instead of being communicated.
<comment>
maybe it's because both sides of our family have a lot of brothers and sisters with kids, but I don't really feel like we're lacking in the family department. sure, we may never be able to have kids [of our genes], but I still feel like I have a big family.
<comment>
I don't really know how it is compared to not taking them. But it is significantly easier for me to cum while the prostate is stimulated as well. I'd imagine that they increase the threshold even there, but not nearly as much as with the pp.
<comment>
I miss it when my friend would send me supportive messages every morning 
it's stupid how much it helped
<comment>
at least you have your boy button to help you out in these trying times. have you considered another ssri to see if you get a better roll of negative symptoms? although if the ssris are really helping your mood, then I can get trading a bit of libido and ease of cumming for happiness

Another day of thanking god for not making me attracted to women.
Maybe the problem is that you are coomers, and not that you're gay?

Haven't pressed it in ages though... That would require using both hands and I would need to wash them as soon as I'm done. And for some reason I frequently get hungry for even more after cumming with it, unlike with pp only where the lewd thoughts pass away rather quickly.
I don't care at all for the negative effects of them desu. I used them for ocd and I'd trade a bunch of my other emotions and body functions to get the thoughts out of my brain. So I only look for efficacy when using them.
And as mentioned, maybe it's for the best to stop self-pleasuring myself, I'm already as deviant as it gets with fetishes...

you should have told me that before I married another dude. it's fucking over

Personality quiz time!
Which of the 4 classical elements is your favorite?
Earth
Water
Fire
Air
I like air :)
<comment>
it's hard to say given when I think of the elements, I think of the sights I've seen that are a combination of most if not all.
<comment>
It's gonna have to be fire
<comment>
It still hurts how suddenly he says he doesnt like me for who I am. When we use to say how we would never leave each other
This is e relationships for you. It's all a lie. They'll string you along for months with this cutesy love dovey talk, but it's absolutely meaningless. In the next moment they'll ghost you and you won't even be able to reach out because it was all anonymous. You can't build relationships based on anonymity. It's not real. It's just a fantasy. 
loser shut in 
Why are you a shut in, exactly?
<comment>
Are you sure the "something missing" isn't just a dating life? A boy to hug and hold hands with? Give it a try
<comment>
wa'ah
because it makes snow
<comment>
If you realize now the mistake of being alone, you should address it, not persist on it
<comment>
Count your blessings, anon. In this day and age being a straight male isn't all that it used to be. Look around. Being straight wouldn't save you from this place. 
You are living in the best day and age to be gay. You can even marry. 
It's not about what cards you were dealt with by life. It's about playing the best possible game with what you've got. 
Instead of wasting your seed with porn, give it to someone real. Make it special. You won't feel so bad about being gay if you try gay dating.
<comment>
the trick with depression is not to do things with having "I want have fun in mind"
You must do something because its routine and adapting a new return will feel good 
with every task you face or game you play
routine is your best friend
<comment>
You can build a family as a gay man too. 
Do you even know where you are? Being straight wouldn't guarantee you a family specially if you don't have a career and no dating life
<comment>
Gay pride is so fucking stupid
No it isn't. Gay pride is the only thing that can save you from these self hating thought patterns. 
It's the lack of self acceptance more than the gayness itself that fucks you up.
<comment>
And ever since 10th grade you've been becoming more and more isolated and self hating. 
The gayness is contained inside your head, and that's a big problem. It's like you don't reap any benefits from being gay, like dating men. 
Give it a try, and you'll suddenly feel way more thankful for being gay.
<comment>
Anon,if he didn't make you feel loved, it wasn't a meaningful relationship.
<comment>
It wasn't a relationship at all
faceless anonymous stranger who you've never met before
call him bf
You deserve better than that
<comment>
why are you only willing to try love behind the curtain of anonymity?
<comment>
after a lifetime of abuse i'm gradually becoming unable to seriously believe in love at all
<comment>
Delicate forehead kisses and then a blowjob
<comment>
lifetime of abuse
Where? By whom? It's not like you tried real life dating and got the bitter end of it. 
Please don't let your heart turn to stone. Loneliness does that to people. 
Love is possible, but your idea of love is very immature, very childish and very prudish. Real love is better because it's real, albeit imperfect
<comment>
Don't believe in love.
Instead believe that an individual exists that can fulfill your needs that is willing to stay by your side no matter the situation.
Love is made up
<comment>
an individual exists that can fulfill your needs that is willing to stay by your side
Also known as love. 
You just have this disney princess idea of love, it's why you love anime love so much. Nothing in real life can match such delusions
<comment>
maybe you're just unwilling to date your looksmatch
<comment>
i got an A in the class i probably didnt earn it in
feels not great
<comment>
Feels kinda like the general has been less active recently. Probably a symptom of the claws of crippling depression closing even tighter around the throats of unfortunate gaybots. I wonder if we'll all eventually end up taking our own lives, and thereby leaving this general a lonesome and empty husk, identical to our own bodies.
Also, I think I like boysocks in a non-lewd way.
What was the class about anon?

You haven't even kissed a boy before. Let's take things one step at a time, alright? First things first. You need to focus on having a first date. We'll worry about the rest later. 
How about you give dating apps a try with the sole purpose of having a date in public? 
You don't have to be a slut if you don't want to
<comment>
If I go on a date he better be buying me a Lego.
<comment>
So you already graduated a bachelors degree?! I don't know if I could ever have enough motivation to do something like that. Impressive anon, I'm proud of you &lt;3
<comment>
You know, I think you should delete your anime folder. I think it's just like pornography, maybe even worse. 
You won't go to a date if you keep being a manchild drooling over gay cartoons and playing with children's toys
<comment>
one day i might be dr. anon and you will see me on tv giving bad advice to people without jobs
<comment>
What are you studying, anony?
<comment>
I want a bf to play with though.
<comment>
I love clever boys. Wish I could be one too...
So what do you like so much about the thing you're studying to potentially go through with a phd?
<comment>
Well you're not looking for one like ever because you're too busy masturbating to cartoons. 
I would play some children's games with my bf, specially jigsaw puzzles and board games, it can be fun but in small doses. But the way you over infantilize relationships make you come across as a pedo. Just saying.
<comment>
That's okay. I'm sure my future husband will understand.
<comment>
Is your throat any better nonny?
<comment>
There won't be any husband if you don't stop being so retarded about these things.
You'll just become storyanon 2.0. 
Delete your anime folder. Cut your hair. Take your antipsychotics. Go to a date. Start your adult life
<comment>
Yeah it's back to normal thank God.
I have to go to the store to buy tweezers and some nair cream for the body and face later. 
And I got a new lego package coming in a few hours. Overall a good day ^_^

i dont know since everyone does a great job keeping it hidden due to where our school is
<comment>
Glad to hear that! Say out of genshin, berserk, and evangelion boys, who do you like the most?
I think that's a very masculine profession of you anon. And probably ultra difficult too, it's like physics but with extra steps! What kind of a fanboy are you? Is it planes, cars, buildings, rockets... or something else that you sperg out about?
What do you think of computational devices operating with digital systems via manipulating and exploiting the properties of that lepton which goes "bzzzz"?

Have you tried making friends with people where you study?

Can't wait to become straight so I can start living mt best life.
<comment>

<comment>
you really think so anon? i appreciate the compliment. im an autist for radios and computers to lesser extent. designing cpus has been some of the most fun ive had in school
lol there isn't much studying together at this level and collaborating with classmates means lab work usually. you bond over your research and it would be weird to potentially ruin that by trying to date them. maybe its different for non-engineers
<comment>
tfw no bf to surprise with the new Lego set he wants just because
<comment>
Bioshock infinite is by far the best game in the series i would say. Yes, this is going to be fun
<comment>
I meant hanging out with your colleagues and making friends, not studying together. 
You're ruining it by isolating and missing out the social opportunities of college
<comment>
im a grown ass adult and i will do as i please
thank you for your concern
<comment>
I forgot to put the chicken in the salt water so it looks like frozen pizza for dinner, again, how wonderful. To think I actually looked forward to these before mom died.
<comment>
i will do as i please
I wish you would invoke this adult autonomy when it comes to having a dating life. 
Unfortunately you isolate yourself from your peers and then you come here to cry about loneliness. 
The contradictions reveal a troubled mind plagued my internalized homophobia and lack of self acceptance
<comment>
Of course I do! It's like a the most practical discipline out there, and for some reason I just find guys solving problems to be quite manly. FYI: I'm kinda the totally opposite of that :D
So radios, huh? What's so cool about them for you? I mean I totally get the whole invisible magic appeal part of it, but you get that with any wireless system out there, right? Ever received a SAQ Grimeton broadcast?
I find CPUs sooo cool! Wish that there were more open-source variants of them :( And I wished that IC's could be examined with the bare eye, just like a motherboard for instance, but I guess that's the tradeoff for speed and ease of production. What kind of instruction set did your designs use?
And just out of curiosity, do you wear glasses?
<comment>
please socialize if you have an opportunity, no matter how painful it is for you. I never did and now look at me, a friendless KHHV at nearly 33 years old.
<comment>
It's amazing how you can ooze desperation from every sentence
<comment>
radios are wonderful because they let us reach out and touch people without ever meeting them. even the smartest person might have trouble explaining in sufficient detail how a circuit is able to be created through air using antennas- ohms and kirchhoffs laws fail to explain it so some aspect of electromagnetics must be used. lol all my cpus were cisc and not very good at that. one was written in verilog and was actually realized using a fpga
<comment>
Self acceptance isn't pride. I'm not proud of being gay. Being gay is a curse.
<comment>
you gotta branch out and find something to look forward to even if its a slight variation of a food you eat often
<comment>
except I enjoy sameness when it comes to food. When mom was around our dinners were very formulaic. A meat of some sort, be that chicken, pork, steak/roast/burgers with steamed potatoes. Occasionally we would have a noddle dish like spaghetti.
<comment>
Self acceptance isn't pride
Yes it is, specially when you live in a world that wants to chew you off for being gay. 
Gay is a curse
Self hatred is a curse. It all depends on the perspective, anon. For me, being gay is a blessing, and gay pride is my sail
I hope you can get on my level one day
<comment>
I wonder if you're losing or gaining weight after your mom passed
<comment>
i get that im the same way but she randomized the selection for you which kept things fresh enough
im proposing you try to do the same by yourself i dont expect you to eat burritos
<comment>
It's no use. Let him crash and burn.
<comment>
I weighed myself the other day. I've lost about 5lbs since she's been gone.
I'm too lazy to cook every day so not every day is cooked food and I eat frozen food, often chicken. Some days I also don't feel like fixing a side and just eat the meat.
<comment>
well enjoy your meals or whatever you experience in place of enjoyment
<comment>
I thought you would lose weight for eating less often, but on the other side you're eating way more frozen processed food, which might be a weight gainer
<comment>
It is a fantastical thing indeed. They excel at using infrastructure that's already present (space) instead of requiring new one to be built whenever you wanna reach some place new. Timeless tech for sure. I though always get too paranoid when using wireless ways of data transmission, it just doesn't stick right with me that it's flowing out there in the open, no matter the encryption used.
I know literally nothing about the actual inner workings of chips and the like, so it's probably way out of my league to ask this, but what exactly made your processor bad at complex instructions? And why didn't you then just use simpler ones instead?
<comment>
oh I don't enjoy anything now. Even vidya is more to pass the time than anything else. 
well I'm back to eating more or less three meals a day again. There for a while I was eating one or two.
<comment>
You have so little to lose now,are you sure you don't want to give dating a try? 
Just don't bring anyone to your house, the cat stench will scare them
<comment>
Sometimes I think that storyanon is the person with whom I have the most in common.
<comment>
a cs student could do a much better job explaining why my processor was bad, probably involving big o notation or some math. i will just say that it was built as an academic endeavor and not to actually compute things. now im out of my league also
<comment>
dating? Likely not. At some point I might try to talk people on line in more private setting but going on a date? Even the thought induces panic, the same panic I used to get when I thought of my mom passing away.
<comment>

Oki doki anon, it's no problem, thanks for bothering in the first place! Sorry for bombarding you without warning... I'm mentally ill, hope you understand :)
Do you wanna be venti, or date him? Maybe both o.o
<comment>
I kinda get it, I used to get the same dating induced panic attacks when I was younger. All I can say is that everything is harder the first few times, but it gets progressively easier with each new attempt. 
I wish you would just take small steps even if it means talking with one guy once every month. Anything is better than nothing
<comment>
Selling old shit 
I kinda wanna be Kaworu more desu desu
<comment>
That your parents bought, lmao. Not your money. 
Anyway, imagine if you used this money to buy ice cream and go to dates in public instead of wasting them on toys. You'd have a bf by now
<comment>
I haven't talked to anyone on a one to one personal level since I left college and that was very rare and more polite small talk than anything else. 
My spaghetti spill would be seen from space.
<comment>
anon i like you and your questions but i am freaking out over my term paper and i just want the pain to end. i have to go scream at it again until it ends or i do
<comment>
on a one to one
I didn't mean talking irl, I know that would be too much for now. I was thinking more about doing it online, but not here in this cesspool. Instead, talking to gay guys in your city who could have real bf potential. 
I don't genuinely expect you to do it because, you know, you're storyanon and everything. But still I can't help but feel some shred of hope for you
<comment>
Again, I'd likely be very flaky and ghost at the drop of a hat. Plus with how weird and out of touch as I am, what could I even talk about with them?
<comment>
talk nerdy to me
<comment>
I'd likely be very flaky and ghost at the drop of a hat.
Even so, it would still be an experience worth having. A little step forward in the journey. Today you might flake and ghost, but if you did that several times, maybe in a few months you'd feel a tiny little bit more comfortable with talking to guys, even if infinitesimally so, it would still be an improvement. Little by little you can get far. 
Your mindset is so defeatist even when hypothesizing, you can only think about all the excuses for not doing it
<comment>
d-do you really mean that? ;-; Thank you... uhm, I like you too?
That's a major reason why school sucks so freaking much imo, the stress and workload knows to be so inconsiderate it's crazy. Best way to lose all joy and interest in any subject if you ask me. Take care, ok? Or before you know it you'll find yourself burnout and not even being able to do homework, let alone a, entire term paper! (just that that wouldn't happen because your too clever, but you get the idea)
If it's not ultra complex, mind telling what the paper is about? And uhm, maybe try getting an AI to help you out?

<comment>
its on recent research on backscatter communication systems. they are like badge readers to let you into places- the reader supplies all the energy to the badge and the badge harnesses it and sends data back to the reader without having a battery. things like barcodes at the grocery store are technically a form of backscatter as the laser hits the barcode and the different stripes reflect a pattern back into the laser which it detects. anew advancement is ambient backscatter systems, where the energy is supplied by sources outside of the backscatter system. that means using existing radio waves like wifi and tv to illuminate the backscatter tag for the reader. also lots of mimo
<comment>
They didn't deliver my lego today I am very sad.
<comment>
I mean, I can blame you in a way, and not in others. You're a victim of your own defective mind, that's for sure. At the same time you still have agency over your life as an adult, but you do nothing with it. 
I guess you're just extremely weak, but can you blame a weak man for being weak? I don't know. Maybe your father could have helped you, your mother clearly didn't have a clue what she was doing. But it's too late for that now. 
I wish I could be there by your side and coach you through life like a fairy godmother, but nobody can do that except you. But you won't do it. 
It's very frustrating, storyanon. Your whole situation is the epitome of frustration. I feel like punching you in the face. How can you be so willing to just roll over and perish? How can someone be so fundamentally broken inside? How could you have let it get this far without reaching for help? 
I don't know, man. I wish you would just become a whore and live out what's left of your youth

I wish you lot's of luck with the paper anon! It's gonna go great, I'm sure of it. And if it doesn't then it didn't matter in the first place and you shouldn't waste your time caring about it :3
<comment>
I just am this way. I've always been easy to give up and lacked any form of willpower. My grandfather was a male role model and alive until I was 24. He tried his best but I still turned out this way so I doubt you could have done any better. 
I don't reach for help because no one cares. I understand the mantra of suffer in silence.
I can't imagine anyone wanting to see that movie.
<comment>
yes rfid and nfc are both forms of backscatter. the mboile wallet apps on your phone are the same but they are very secure since they generate new numbers for every transaction, which your cards do not. the just got my flipper zero in the mail and its a neat little tamagotchi that clones rfid/nfc cards and does other dirty little tricks to defeat access control systems

no, they all legit hated me because I was stuck up and thought I was smarter than them. I corrected people if I heard they were wrong about something. 
No one ever complimented me on anything and certainly no one ever asked me to hang out. I was beaten up 3 times in HS and narrowly avoided more by managing to run to the nearest teacher in time.

To me that's like being proud of being deaf or near-sighted. People are strange
<comment>
more like ginger or blonde pride or something to me, shit just doesnt matter
I dont want to have parades and stick it in peoples faces, Im happy with just people finding out and being like "oh, alright" nothing more than that
<comment>
It does matter. Straight people have higher reported happiness, lower rates of drug abuse, lower rates of mental illness, less chance of being assaulted or abused, more stable relationships, etc.
Sure you can say all of the above is due to "Discrimination" but it holds in countries with high gay acceptance like Denmark.
<comment>
plus 2 times in middle school. 
Anyway
once because I corrected this gangsta type dude because he said something wrong in class. Just straight up walked over to me and started slugging me. Teacher was an old woman and couldn't stop him and had to run to get a male teacher to pull him off.
second time wasn't really my fault, I accidentally stepped on someone's shoes in the hallway and they just turned around and decked me. crumpled from once punch and started crying, the guy only threw the one punch though, then tried to claim he didn't actually hit me. Cameras proved my story though. 
Third was when I refused to let someone copy off me during a test. Waited until after school and jumped me on my way out of the building.

I don't know what that means. so I'm going to assume you're saying "yes, anon you are correct, and also handsome and cool."
<comment>
that's like being proud of being deaf or near-sighted
But that's a very reasonable thing, we do have disability pride month as well. In a world that tells them they're defective and broken, these people rise with their newfound pride to be their best selves. This is who they are. They were born this way (remind you of something?) and there's no changing it. 
They can live their entire lives being ashamed of being different, or they can learn to love every bit of themselves, flaws and qualities alike, and be proud of it. 
In the end of the day, you still see your homosexuality as your weakness. You have so much to learn from handicapped people. 
People are strange, and you're the strangest of them all. But what's stranger is you not loving who you are, including the gay part.
<comment>
handsome and cool
no it means you're a christfagging moron
<comment>
But that's a very reasonable thing,
No, no it's not. If you want perspective on this topic from someone who is actually disabled, read 2arms1head. Disabled people acting "proud" and "loving themselves" gives the image to others that being disabled doesn't suck, which it does.
<comment>
dont want to have parades and stick it in peoples faces
You think that being out in the streets is sticking up to anyone's face? You have stray dog syndrome, it's like you only believe your sexuality is valid if it's hidden from view, kept indoors like a shameful secret. 
Do you think that straight couples in public are sticking it up in your face?
The only reason why you have freedom to be gay and even marry a man is because of those parades. 
oh, alright" nothing more than that
I wonder what do you have to say to the thousands of LGBT teens who experience homelessness every year for being kicked out of their homes by homophobic families
<comment>
You think discrimination doesn't exist in developed countries?
You are literally the face of what homophobia can do to a gay person: make them hate themselves after a lifetime of being taught gayness is evil. Make them repress their sexualities with terrible side effects on their mental health. 
You're like the quintessential example of how discrimination affects gay people's upbringing, but you're so blinded by your internalized homophobia that you would rather blame the gays themselves instead of the gay hating world the brought us here
<comment>
God damn no one cares nigga!
<comment>
Do straight people stay in the closet for most of their lives out of fear, just like you have?
<comment>
I agree with hue, had my family been more accepting I might have taken a more active role in trying to date and be normal but I was too scared of them finding out and disowning me.
<comment>
I think you are the one who needs a broader perspective. Regardless of how being handicapped sucks, it's their life and there's no changing it. 
When you go around reminding people of all their limitations and all the ways their lives will be harder, you're just being mean for no purpose. 
Rather than focusing on what they can't do, proud handicapped people rise from the abyss of self pity (where you live) to remind you of all the innumerous ways they can overcome their challenges and live a fulfilling life, and for that they need self acceptance and pride. 
You want them to focus solely on the negative parts of their lives because that's what you're doing, and that's just being cruel, anon. You're being cruel to yourself.

I just hope you do that before you're 30 so you don't completely miss out on your 20's being all alone

You should forgive yourself for being gay
<comment>
You're still missing out on the twinks you adore so much, soon enough you'll be too old to date them
<comment>
I never said I hated myself. Anons can't read, sperg out, and then get all emotional.
<comment>
Can you put 2 and 2 together or are you just playing dumb?
Society's discrimination is the reason why you hate being gay, which in turn is tbe reason why you never do anything gay unless it's anonymously and online, which is why you don't have a bf and have never even kissed anyone
<comment>
You don't even understand the concept of being proud of being LGBT, that's how much you hate being one.
<comment>
There are two ways we use the word "Proud". You can be proud of an accomplishment. Obviously being gay is not an accomplishment. Or you can be proud in the sense that you appreciate or have fondness for something. Being gay is worse than being straight so I have no fondness for it.
I don't think this is hard to understand. Do diabetics hate themselves? No, they just wish they weren't diabetic. Same with me
<comment>
Obviously being gay is not an accomplishment
Loving yourself in a world that wants you to hate yourself is quite the accomplishment, I hope you could achieve that one day. The rewards will be plenty.
<comment>
too old to date them because you're an ugly old man!!
rape :)
<comment>
Being gay is worse than being straight so I have no fondness for it
That's the self hating mindset. 
Being gay is, simply. It is what it is. It doesn't matter what your life would be like if you weren't gay, you are gay, there's no changing that. 
So instead of focusing on the million ways you can overcome your challenges and find love and fulfilment as a gay guy, you keep wallowing in self pity hating yourself for not being born normal. 
You do have much to learn from handicapped people
<comment>
"anon why dont you like faggots"
gaybots biting hue bait day in and day out
<comment>
compares his gayness to a life threatening disease
There's the self hatred we're talking about
<comment>
tfw can't use analogies or metaphors on 4chan anymore cuz people always take them literally.
<comment>
It's not bait if it's educational. You see your gayness as a curse, a disease, a flaw, a mistake. 
This mindset is detrimental to your mental health and it keeps you from finding love
<comment>
Your analogies reveal how you feel about your sexuality, and you definitely don't feel good about it when all you can do is compare it to bad things
<comment>
Let's be honest if the cure for gayness came out 95% the faggots in the world would take it.
<comment>
You're pathetic, chudcel. And lonely. 
Tell me when you grow tired of hating yourself, I hope it happens before you're 30
<comment>
If 
That's the thing, anon. There is no gay cure. 
Once again you reveal your self hatred by dreaming about a cure for your sexuality. 
You literally view it as a defect. 
No bf for you, for how can you love a bf if you hate the fact that you love men?
<comment>
He has no response
He cannot debate the ethics of raping twinks because he knows he is wrong
I have won the conversation and I accept your concession
<comment>
if that was the major reason then id just be one of the discrete gays, no? the reason im like that is because socializing in that way makes me feel sick. i guess it would be one less thing to think about if i werent gay though
<comment>
Meh, I can jerk off I don't need flings with strangers. Our current culture is hyper sexualized
<comment>
stop biting hue bait, come on.
<comment>
the ethics of raping
You're a big joke, you know that right? 
Tell me what does it feel like to be 20+ and having never kissed a boy before?
<comment>
erk off
Is that your replacement for love?
He can't even see himself in a relationship with other men
There's the self hatred sparkling again. 
Humans are hyper sexual, nature is. It doesn't stop you from finding love. 
But your self hatred does. 
Can only see himself having a fling with a stranger
Sad and bitter.
<comment>
you're a big joke you know that right
Yeah keep thinking that brown boy! One of these days you will be walking home to your shitty favela housing and behind you you vill here heavy labored breathing. You will turn around and see me there. As you turn to run I will fall on your crushing you under my massive body. You will cry out for someone to stop me but none will because your country is a shithole. The last thing you will hear is "OHHH SIM, VOCE CHEIRA MUITO BOM, MENINO" before you are UTTERLY and TOTALLY RAPED
<comment>
I will use CRISPR to cure gayness. Just give it time
<comment>
id just be one of the discrete gays, no?
You are one of the discreet gays. Your discretion is so extreme that you inhabit the depths of the closet alone in secret. 
you hate yourself so much you can't even talk with a gay guy without the cover of anonymity.
<comment>
socializing in that way makes me feel sick
You mean you are so sexually repressed you can't even talk with other guys? 
Yeah, pretty much stemming from your self hatred too
<comment>
You're not the first self hating fag to hunt for the gay cure, and sadly you won't be the last. 
Most of them use prayers or other hocus pocus though. 
You will try so hard, for so long, to get rid of the gay, until you realize how much easier it is to get rid of the internalized homophobia. On That day you'll be free
<comment>
Bitch can't even kiss a boy or to a date. You won't rape anybody. 
go to a date before you're 30, your opinion literally doesn't matter until you do that
<comment>
I won't live to see it, maybe, but it will happen and my spirit will look fondly on the hetero world below. I will plant the gay cure so that the gay men of the future can lay under the heterosexual tree

Self hating queen. 
If genetic engineering get that far, we'll be able to breed babies from two dads or two moms, thus making the world even gayer
<comment>
Ahem, Gentlemen I have an announcement to make. This image makes my dick very hard. That is all.
<comment>
God that picture is gross.
<comment>
well, probably. still it goes beyond talking to other guys, so i dont think sexual orientation has that much to do with it
<comment>
Your homophobia is gross. Loving families are beautiful no matter their configuration
<comment>
I am raising my children christian.

<comment>
You're blind and in denial. Your internalized homophobia and lack of self acceptance are one of the main reasons why you are incapable of dating men.

Being gay is amazing, but being a self hating lonely celibate is pretty repulsive indeed. 
It's sad that you put the blame on your sexuality (that you can't change) and not on your incel attitude

<comment>
i dont think so. i think im just generally insecure and adverse to people taking interest to my thoughts and life. the only thing specific to dating is an added layer of intimacy and expectation. which to be fair are the worst layers
<comment>
absolutely based.
keep them away from faggy stuff, be a great father figure, treat their mother like a princess and live with love.
that done, you can be quite sure of a good upbringing.
careful not to go into an ignorant facade of Christianity where you're just oppressing them.
<comment>
I will treat their father like a prince.
<comment>
two fathers will fuck up their upbringing.
same-sex couples they come out wrong, no matter what.
<comment>
adverse to people taking interest to my thoughts and life.
And guess why that is, closet queen
Someone is deadly scared of being dragged out of the closet, and it's you
<comment>
keep them away from faggy stuff
Like their parents? Lmao 
There's like 25 years of research disagreeing with you on this
<comment>

You have some nerve saying that in the same post where you tell a gay man to marry a woman and keep his family away from queerness 
Whatever you think the intolerant facade of christianity is, you're closer to it than you admit

cue parades with children doing risque dancing for money and kissing grown men
<comment>
Cue parades with people marching on the streets in daily attire 
A side of our community you will always ignore, so you can only focus on that which fuels your homophobia and self hatred
<comment>
why hasn't the proper part eliminated the rest, then?

Maybe you should listen to what these children have to say

<comment>
why hasn't the proper part eliminated the rest
Why hasn't straight people eliminated LGBT individuals?
The answer is the same. 
You want to purge degenerates so badly that you end up forgetting you are one
<comment>
so you agree homosexuals are degenerate. hah.
<comment>
gentlemen
i have just touched myself to homoerotic images
<comment>
Do you realize that everyone in this site is a degenerate, including you, right?
degeneracy is just a word, and it's often used to mean anything that isn't straight people married. 
I don't have any trouble admitting it. I'm not the self hating queen in denial. That's you. 
You hate being gay so much that you look for reasons to diminish our worth, even when we're living the dream of building a family. 
What years of prejudice have done to you

What is it like to live in US and are niggers that annoying
<comment>
First of all most mass shooters and serial killers are nonblack, chud. Anyways it's not good but not shit, some people like to exaggerate because they live in shitholes like Detroit or Missouri. There a lot of good states and towns for good non-racist God fearing men

99.9% of what you read on the internet is hyper sensationalized. The US is fine and the actual niggery is contained to small pockets of large urban centers where no one ever goes. The black people in the country and suburbs are completely normal.

Blacks hate you for being white, take offense to everything and will attack you if you go into their neighborhoods without being black. Red states are pretty nice though (if you're white).

This is factually incorrect you nigger lover. The vast majority of all mass shootings are black on black or hispanic on hispanic or some sort of combination gang violence.

He's not wrong. At the end of the day, if she goes down, blacks will ALWAYS side with blacks and attack you. Hell, all it takes is one word and they'll instantly turn into murderous animals. They're the most violent and fragile animals on the planet.

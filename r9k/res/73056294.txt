Why do people think trans kids dont exist? i wanted to transition when i was 12, but this was back inlike 2013 and all i saw about trannies were that they were disgusting monsters, and then around 2015 bruce jenner came out (i fucking hate HIM (hes the only tranny i misgender)) and decided to repress
i started hrt at19. the feelings never went away. they just got stronger over time
instead i had to sit there and see my body masculinize. i would stare at my body hair, disgusted. i would stare at my feet, disgusted, wishing they would stop growing. i entered a chronic state of dissociation and suicidal ideation. i tried to kill myself 3 times. at 19 i couldnt bare it anymore and started hrt. i just wish i could have gone back and started earlier
id probably (definitely) pass better than i do, and id be better off
if you dont think trans kids exist, hi. i was one of them. and im still trans now.

Trans are mentally ill. Males are lacking testosterone and idk why you're all so easy to brainwash.

Hi, trans kid. Be my trans wife.

Gender dysphoria is real and the threat of kids seriously medically transitioning without having dysphoria, purely to follow a trend essentially doesnt exist in any future.
In 95% of cases transition is an medical response to the condition that is gender dysphoria and the earlier its applied the more effective it is. In 5% of cases its autists deluding themselves already well into adulthood.
That said im a nazi, ideally we'd just develop the ability to detect gender dysphorias bio markers in the womb and abort them because its a horrid existence whether transition is easily available or not.
<comment>
I agree with anon. OP parents did shitty job and should noticed something is off. They should brought OP to clinic to check his levels. It is illness what should have been cured, but instead was ignored and it started to mess with the brain longrun. Sad.
<comment>
wtf why i do i agree with a nazi 
and why tf does a nazi think like me
no i should have started hrt when i was 12
<comment>
Thank you, trans wife.
And people gatekeep trans people with a million different tests that are essentially impossible to pass to decide whether they're "really trans" or not. Cis people think "I would never want to transition myself, nor would most people, therefore anyone who feels differently is deluding themselves." And, of course, the fact that many MtF transitioners do not pass contribute to this. If they had the success rate of FtM, the backlash would be only a small percent of what it is. It's a sad combination of elementary school-tier emotional intelligence and empathy and in many cases low IQ as well.

How long have you been taking HRT for? Are you self medicated or prescribed? What's your dosing regimen? If someone started HRT at age 18, what sort of results could they reasonably expect after 5 years? What are their chances of passing?
<comment>
I knew a 22 year old once who started at 18. She passed facially, had big boobs, and people on 4chan said she had a body better than most cis women.
<comment>
how long
3.5 years
prescribed?
yes
regimen
6 mg estradiol valerate every 5 days + 100mg progesterone + 1.25g finasteride (im terrified of dht even tho my hairline is fine)
outcome at 18
probably going to end up fine, id say 80+percent of people who start at end up passing
yeah :| it sucks
<comment>
:( i wish i couldce transitioned earlier too
<comment>
Don't we all? They just want us to die before we get access to hrt.
<comment>
It doesn't matter what you say on this board, i believe you because i was in your same situation, but people will just say "Oh it's a troll, oh it's a psyop, it's a fake story", they don't take us seriously, they just want us to die, they want kids to die.
<comment>
yeah im pretty sure theymd be fine with killing us all
sadly
<comment>
it really sucks :( i would pass so much better too
<comment>
Arm yourselves if you leave in the US, for the love of god buy a firearm, they are coming for us and i refuse to go down without a fight.
<comment>
retards, some mtfs were given trt and it just made their dysphoria worse
the only reason mtfs aren't passing is because they aren't getting hrt as early as they should be, i expect the new youngshit generation to be well off (hopefully)
i believe you too op, hugs
every trans person should own at least a few firearms for self-defense, whether you live in the us or not
<comment>
Why do people think trans kids dont exist?
because most people didn't even know trans people existed until like 2015. It's an absurdly fast social upheaval that the public understands as much about them as they do in such a short time.
<comment>
Yeah you're right, i'd kill to have had the opportunity to start at 18, i used to look so good back then, i got gatekept for 4 fucking years and only managed to start 2 months ago, i still look decent but when i look at my old pictures it's honestly suicide fuel, i can see the difference from then and now.

For most people, the idea of transgenderism of a child is going to always be a betrayal. 
Do you think most parents will be okay with completely reversing their parenting styles and methods for 9+ years because X is trans and wants HRT? 
They won't. 
Having kids will always be a selfish thing. It's usually a parent's dream to have kids. The change of identity is essentially them losing their son/daughter.
It's too much of a change for current-generation parents. 
And for most parents below the median income. Which make up a majority of the silent majority. Which essentially drives politics. The right will use this as a 'radical departure from American Freedom', after all. 
It's equally their right to inform their own children of such matters, as it is for a school to do so. 
But one sounds much more morally and ethically right than the other for most people. 
Expecting parents to change this social norm in a matter of less than half a decade is incredibly foolish and unrealistic. 
The intense push for change is similar to the civil rights movement. Although, I am actually unsure if you will actually win-out. 
Even if you win, many people will still absolutely despise you. You will prob face the same treatment as black people in the future.
Trangenderism should be studied intensely from a psychological standpoint because it will prob be the next crazy, hyper-unethical one that will change a facet of history. 
So, I don't necessarily stake a tent on any side. I simply don't care about it. 
I believe it will sort itself out eventually.
For the extremely paranoid types that make up the government, transgender people can arguably create a national security threat. 
It's the reason why pushback is only going to become greater for your people.

Do you think most parents will be okay with completely reversing their parenting styles and methods for 9+ years
Why do you think parents would have to do that?
Luckily my parents were accepting and are supportive when I started transitioning when i was 19. they didnt change much aside from calling me a new name and using she/her. thats it. we even got to do new stuff together and bond more
It's equally their right to inform their own children of such matters, as it is for a school to do so.
no its not, especially when its such a topic like being queer. kids get beaten up regularly for being queer. its a safety issue
<comment>
It's over sister after puberty you will never look like a real woman no matter how much you delude yourself, I'm sorry.
<comment>
yeah i know 
its horrible
<comment>
Why do you think parents would have to do that?
You were 19. 
You were your own adult at that point. 
They can't stop you from doing literally anything. You are already grown-up and child-reared. You can go murder someone and be charged as an adult, separately from your parents.
Believe it or not, parents change mindsets a lot when you are basically 17+. This isn't unusual, but we are talking about earlier transitioning, aren't we?
Now, if you were underage, say 12-16. I'm sure you can see the issue that such parents will face. 
kids get beaten up regularly for being quee
Has absolutely no bearing on an individual's right to rear one's child. 
It's not considered a safety issue in the courts. It's not even close to a valid argument if that's brought to them.
If that was the case, we wouldn't be having this issue, right?
Although, if you actually wanted to fix it.
It's similar to post-civil rights. Blacks still had all the rights, but faced heavy discrimination and persecution regardless of the court's rulings. That is what you are facing. The hearts and minds of the general populace. 
The community at large should focus on passing a hate-crime legislature for transgenders, if it isn't already there.
If anything, it's a cultural issue resulting from the lack of acceptance of anything LGBTQ related from most households in the world for about 150+ years. That's why kids are beating the shit out of others. Or they are simply violent and you are easy targets.

gays and lesbians got their moment in the 80s and 90s, now we get our moment
<comment>
They still got prosecuted. 
I don't understand how you still want your moment without a single ounce of backlash. 
The gays and lesbos faced similar, although much more barbaric psyops against them. 
Remember, gay marriage wasn't a thing until Obama lol.
Many gays and lesbians people were treated regardless as degenerates for many, many years after that. You will face similar. Expecting that to change is still unrealistic.
<comment>
Oh no I do believe that trans kids exist. 
I'm just a religious fellow who sticks to what The Bible says. That being said, I don't have anger at trans people, just a sadness. To be uncomfortable with ones true self is relateable, as I hate my true self (chronic depressos and low self esteem). I find trans people a step beyond me, as I accept who I am (even though I loathe it) because it is my id and my ego. Trans people on the otherhand don't like their genetics, their chromosomes. Sure there's also a distaste at a societal definition of many things, but when it comes down to it, I'd say if there was a "switch my genetics from xx-->xy" pill or vice-versa, most trans people would happily take that pill.
<comment>
i'm truscum til the day i fucking die, sorry you had legitimate dysphoria but so many fucking kids are literally being brainwashed and peer pressured into transitioning
it happened to me in high school in 2010, thank god i was never allowed to do irreparable harm to myself
i was a camp counselor for 'gifted' kids a few years ago and 80% were autistic and 80% of the autistic kids were lgbt
they aren't trans, they're autistic
if people just shut the fuck up about how brave trannies were and treated dysphoria like any other medical condition there wouldn't be an issue and you could just transition anybody with dysphoria
but the faggot-kiked medical system and their jewish propaganda arm won't shut the fuck up about it and turned the lgbt pride flag into a fucking merit badge
faggots can exist but fag enablers need to be riddled with bullets
<comment>
so you would rather have kids try to kill themselves and probably succeed (i just suck at killing myself)? than transition?
I'd say if there was a "switch my genetics from xx-->xy" pill or vice-versa, most trans people would happily take that pill.
yes I would take that pill in a heartbeat
<comment>
never said it was going to be easy, just saying now is our time to fight for that
<comment>
chances of passing?
kek.
<comment>
so you would rather have kids try to kill themselves and probably succeed (i just suck at killing myself)? than transition?
not what i said
the brainwashing of normal children needs to stop completely
then people who naturally have dysphoria will get suprvised medical treatment like any other psychological problem
<comment>
I don't believe your people will succeed because your identity and doctrine are far too vague. 
The LBGT movement was successful because it was more like LBG. It also helped, that they had credible arguments and agreed on many topics.
I don't believe the T's have that.
Do you think T's should compete in bio sports?
Bathroom issues?
A realistic appraisal of HRT through the healthcare system?
Lots of opinions, not a lot of motion.
All I hear is 'we get beat up, so it's time to fight back!' and 'I want my kid to be taught about trans in middle school'.
A majority of normies laugh at this and never take it seriously.
<comment>
then people who naturally have dysphoria will get suprvised medical treatment like any other psychological problem
not if you keep treating it like you do now.
<comment>
thought about transitioning when I was 14 due to tumblr/reddit memes
grew out of it in a couple years
I'm happy nobody takes children seriously on this shit
<comment>
due to tumblr/reddit memes
thats the difference between me and you, I was suffering. you weren't. fuck off.
<comment>
that was the point of my post, I didn't suffer because the system works
sorry it didn't work for you
<comment>
the system works
it didn't work for you
PICK.ONE.
<comment>
man so glad I was just born a woman and can just leave the house with bed head and in my jammies and people wont question it, they will just think im a cute sleepy girl.
<comment>
the fact that one or two people are ignored by society, or even harmed by it, doesn't necessarily mean that the system as a whole is broken or that it could be improved
post bedhead
<comment>
oh but if a guy does that its considered weird and creepy and offputting
<comment>
only if he has a purse and bolt-ons
<comment>
One of my best friends was a chad in highschool, constantly worked out, had a car and a goth gf, the works, but still transitioned after graduating. She told me she knew she was trans the whole time but was afraid to come put while she was living with her parents. 
I had another friend who was also raised to be super manly (camping, hunting, cars and home improvement) but they still identify as nonbinary. 
This cope about trans coming from low-test, bad upbringing, being groomed, or whatever other stupid shit you morons come up with is in direct contradiction with the facts, and the only reason you still believe it is because you like to flat-out deny all the contradicting evidence.
<comment>
when is the new chapter gonna get finally released btw
<comment>
It is caused by something in the environment.
That's why already 4% of gen z is tranny and increasing.
<comment>
its not that high
and the majority of those are nobinary
a small % are actually transitioning
<comment>
I do believe trans kids exist, but I also believe kids/teenagers are an impressionable bunch of nitwits who dont even know their dick from their assholes, even less the dimensions, colors and nuances of their perception of self, their emotions and moods. So I dont believe trans kids exist in the over represented numbers they do know. I'd say 75% of people getting into treatment should never have been allowed to.
I think there's a whole bunch of kids and teenagers with identity issues not stemming from gender dysphoria, like personality disorders, autism.
Body dysmorphia is another big one. Just a whole bunch of teenagers who wish to be beautiful and sought after and they see rather average looking boys turn into 'beautiful' (there's alot of bullshots and photoshoping in alot of these pictures) girls after transitioning.
Frankly a whole bunch of just straight up gay kids who have a more fluid sense of gender gets also swept up in this. 
Then theres the attention seeking people, usually due to personality disorder like BPD or histrionic personality disorder who just want to jump on the bandwagon and either cash in on the positive attention or harvest the negative attention to fuel their victim complex.
The last bunch is just the impressionable, gullible ones who attach themselves to whoever gives them an ounce of attention and they end up in straight up groomer pedo discords with demented degenerates who's only goal is to get as many teenagers to transition as possible, usually with the intent of fucking them at some point. I hate to play into the republican stereotype, but unfortunatly, these people exists.
If you never had an incling that you had gender dysphoria before you discovered it on the internet, chances are you never had it to begin with, you're just misatributing a coctail of emotiona and self esteem issues to gender dysphoria, which definition these days is so fucking vague it encapsulates very common feelings of depression and anxiety.
<comment>
gender dysphoria, which definition these days is so fucking vague it encapsulates very common feelings of depression and anxiety.
no, it's quite literally the opposite. the new guidelines get more restrictive every update. what the fuck are you talking about
<comment>
You have body dysmorphia, make like most trannies and kill your self.
<comment>
Will I end up passing if I start at age 21?
<comment>
idk its up to genetics at that point
<comment>
you're spot on ab dysphoria but desu if transition goes well, then it's a beautiful existence imo.
<comment>
i wish i could've transitioned earlier even though i pass just bc i missed out on all that childhood. i was supposed to be a girl but i had to go through it with everyone thinking i'm weird bc they looked at me as a boy. i've been climbing out of the pit of depression and isolation but i just wish i never had that and i had the happy memories i always wanted in my childhood instead. but the future is all we have so i'm grateful for the memories ahead of me.
<comment>
Have you tried giving up porn and not being a crazy faggot yet.
You are not and would never have been a woman.+kpvd2
<comment>
When I was 12 I wanted to be a girl. I do not anymore, and would've hated myself if I knew what being trans was, told my parents, and permantly changed my body. Sometimes it works out, but most of the time kids don't know what they want.
<comment>
i think you will pass if your face already looks feminine and you're willing to voice train a lot. there are certain features that are hard to get rid of, like a long face or huge shoulders, but if you don't have those then you could pass. just remember to put effort into looking good like basically all other girls do. and i think ppl neglect voice training wayyy too much bc i've seen so many trans girls who pass so well until they start talking.
<comment>
no, it's quite literally the opposite. the new guidelines get more restrictive every update. what the fuck are you talking about
Yeah nah, go into any trans space online and you'll find they operate with their own definition of gender dysphoria as they find the DSM one way too restrictive and in cases 'transphobic'. 
I honestly find alot of it off putting as I only see a whole bunch of autistic neets who wants to be a 15 year old anime girl so they can dildo themselves in front of a mirror. There's an element of this that is so fucking highly sexualized that every other aspect of being a woman falls by the wayside. it's not even about being a woman, but inhabiting the body of a woman. You can usaully seperate them because these 'trans' people have never had a single doubting thought about their gender before puberty and presented exclusively as a male up to that point. 
If you were 8 years old, playing with barbie dolls and picking out girls clothes at the store and whatnot, I'd believe you actually have gender dysphoria, but if you're first step towards transexuality was buying rainbow tigh highs and shaving your dick and balls, imagining you're some anime character, yeah nah, I dont buy it because then you miss what being a woman is by several fucking nautical miles. At least a real one.
<comment>
i wanted to transition when i was 3 and didn't start until 23? 24?
<comment>
awe i'm sorry you had all those years taken from you. but i'm glad you have all these years to live as yourself ahead of you. &lt;3
<comment>
yeah it could be worse, although i have a harder time of finding relationship(s) than i did as a feminine boy and i'm scared of growing old or dying alone
<comment>
Yeah nah, go into any trans space online and you'll find they operate with their own definition of gender dysphoria
I don't care, we're talking about medical stringency. 
If you were 8 years old, playing with barbie dolls and picking out girls clothes at the store and whatnot, I'd believe you actually have gender dysphoria
that's not how this works, either. you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what gender dysphoria is
<comment>

No one has any idea what "gender dysphoria" is because its not real, there's no evidence for it.

No one has any idea what [INSERT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION HERE] is because its not real, there's no evidence for it.
shut up retard
<comment>
ik you'll find the right one who accepts you for who you are. once you start hrt all your aging in the future will be female aging. i hope you get to do all the things you wished to do when you were younger. btw girls are way less restricted with what hobbies they can have so if you're into something rly silly or immature go for it lol. the world is your oyster!!
<comment>
you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what gender dysphoria is
That lines up perfectly with the DSM's definition of gender dysphoria, so what the fuck you're talking about, you have to elaborate. Or you operate with an online redefinition of gender dysphoria which at this point is 'anything I want it to be'.
<comment>
LOL, I'm not the one whose injecting myself with hormones so I don't kill my self lmao. 
There is both basically no good scientific studies on transgenderism and no actual evidence that the condition is in anyway different from other forms of delusions.

literally nothing in here is about playing with toys

I don't know how to convey to you that MtFs feel like males to me on an intuitive level. Not physically, psychologically. It feels a lot like if I just decided to become a female for fun. That's why. If I was a psychological doctor in the 1950's I would probably interrogate and abuse trans people to get at the root of gender identity and expression and understand it. Alas, we are in 2023, so I am just your average transphobe
<comment>
It would be included under 
A strong desire to be treated as the other gender 
or 
A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender
Foreign hormones messing with your brain?

I don't know how to convey to you that MtFs feel like males to me on an intuitive level.
it's not complicated. you're just a transphobe. we know this is what you think already its not some revelation 
It would be included under
no it wouldn't. i don't know why you just think that playing with toys counts as this, but it doesn't
<comment>
No problem.
I just think that the state sanctioned curing of delusions by cosmetic surgery is morally wrong.

Pray tell, what did they mean by those then.

Well, I think you're raising a point that when people discuss it, they ignore various aspects that I think are important. I consider myself to be quite open to these things, but, that doesn't mean that I don't think there's a big misconception on body dismorphia as a whole, both by the general public, and transexual people. Here's the thing, gender disphoria is a condition, regardless of what it may represent to the person who has it or to the person who criticizes it, so there are certain things that are necessary to take into account when dealing with it that both sides ignore entirely. One of them, for instance, is the fact that just because someone believes that they NEED to transition, doesn't mean that they should, or that it's the solution. Just like when a very depressed person thinks suicide is what they need. It probably isn't the solution, right? Though they have the right to kill themselves if they wish, it's not an answer. Another thing is that it's a psychological condition that is, undeniably, based on appeareance; for instance, for someone to say that they feel like a woman in a man's body, that's objectively something that doesn't make much sense, not because it's dumb or anything, but simply because there's not a way for anybody to feel that they're something, the only reason someone can tell you that they feel like x gender, is because their genitalia, since your brain or thoughts don't feel different, in fact, thoughts aren't felt to begin with, not tangibly, so it's purely a psychological construct, which is quite ironic, since most people in those communities say that gender is a construct, well, if it is why would a man feel like a woman to begin with. I think that it's like talking about a nosejob, I wouldn't judge anyone for that, and I wouldn't tell them that their nose is fake, but if someone has a negative perception of their nose, surgery shouldn't be the immediate action, and could not even be a solution to the problem itself
<comment>
yeah and you six of them. stop pretending that "omg this kid plays with girl toys!! hes trans!!!" That literally never fucking happens
it is a made up fantasy
<comment>
Just like when a very depressed person thinks suicide is what they need
Not comparable at all I have no clue how you think this is a good analogy. 
based on appeareance
no its not. it's a hormonal thing too. I felt fucking atrocious when I was on a high level of testosterone. I literally feel better having estrogen in me.

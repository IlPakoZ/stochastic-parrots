You know like, achieve social media fame and money, and get laid by notoriety? What's the max age at which this can occur?
I dont think actually ugly freaks can make it. All those people having glow ups on tiktok and shit always looked like normal,even pretty people under all that grease and fat. I tried to have a "glow up" and failed. Atleast the psychological gains were worth it.
Is it possible for an INCEL to have a 'glow up'?
Maybe when they give him a job.
You don't need that, just do drugs and treat women like shit.

i did but im still a khv
if you're famous enough your social media will blow up and girls will want to sleep with you no matter what.
its the boyband effect or something. if enough women scream the other women will too without knowing why. so if women are under the impression that a lot of women wants to sleep with you they will want to themselves regardless of looks and past. just look at rockstars from the 70s and 80s, they looked like shit back then too and dressed ridiculous, did destructive amounts of drugs and alcohol yet they fucked so much a lot of them had to go to rehab for sex addiction.
"Glow ups" are when extroverted but slightly overweight Brads and Beckys lose the weight and become Chads and Stacies. A low-value incel can work his ass off for years and still will never be perceived by normoids as having had a "glow up".
this.
in most cases its when some girl goes to college, wears make up and is popular all of a sudden.

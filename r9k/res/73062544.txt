Anons, go to places like Vietnam, Burma, or Egypt for a few weeks.
You will notice how much better things are in developing countries. People lead simple lives, ride 60's motorbikes, nobody uses social media, nobody knows what the hell AI is. It's very comfy. I hate hyper digitalized nations.
I was in Vietnam for a long time. There's lots of social media. Many shops only sell through Facebook.
There arent self driving cars that collect your behavioral data though
I'm envious of you
Apart from the fuckin humidity, it's a nice place
So cheap man.

NEETing is so much better than waging. if it's a decent paying job with benefits and can outpace inflation, only then is it really better to be working. most jobs are rigged nowadays to the point where you can barely wipe your ass, afford food and a place to live (with 3+ roommates). professional jobs barely pay for a one bedroom apartment that isn't infested with rats, let alone a down payment on a house. guy from last job lives with his girlfriend, she works an office job and he works as a landscaper. they each pay half in rent (700 dollars a month). he said they're both saving up for a down payment on a house. you can afford to do it with dual income, but what happens if the girl decides she doesn't need him anymore and wants the house for herself? he'll be out on the streets. I wouldn't want to trust a woman to pay for a house with me, she'd look down on me and probably want to cheat with a man who makes more money. so what do?
NEET
become a drug dealer
those two are the only real options anymore. I wasn't born into a middle class family that could set me up with a job, not even working class. My mom can't get me a job at her warehouse, no one is hiring online or in person. Can't get a job at a grocery store. I can't sell drugs so I'll be a NEET. couldn't even save with the shit jobs I had. All of them are a waste of time, but if I at least look like I'm doing something I won't be homeless within the year. but I can't even do that. 
shit's so gay now, I'll keep trying but everything is rigged and gay. I'm literally better off wacking it and playing video games/smoking weed, even though I would like a shot at fixing up my life I can't even get a job flipping burgers. It fucking sucks. and when you make no money as an adult everyone even your family hates your guts.

why cant you work at amazon? I got fired from that for doing something pretty stupid, but i was making 20 an hour 40 hours a week doing practically nothing.

my cousin works at amazon, and they can't get me a job there lol. they are letting half of their staff go and a few FCs in the surrounding towns got shut down, so those workers moved to the FC where my cousin works.
I applied to walmart, grocery stores, coffee shops and cafes etc. trying everything but looks like I'm destined to stay home, play video games and smoke too much dope.

i stand corrected with that

can always try harder, sure. sending 150 applications a day instead of 100 will up my chances slightly. sure.
more bunghole

damn. Maybe you're doing something wrong

maybe the country is in a recession, resume is updated and I include key words so it's not that. friend has a master's degree and works as a cashier at tim hortons, I would kms if that was me. at least I don't have debt.

also I got a few hits for interviews but the employers ghosted me. one was for assistant manager other was for warehouse general labor.

Is there even much of a point in trying for love if you're naturally shy and not very dominant 
what are you talking about? polygamy doesn't count.
I was saying going gay isn't an option either because you're just seen as a diet woman
what? i still don't understand
option for what?
Find a girl who likes shy guys? Or actually dont find a girl, ever. I just know that you are insufferable
Might as well tell OP to just win the lottery.
I mean I'm not op but I appear shy (I just hate most people, both their bodies and minds so I ignore everyone who isn't into anime and lifting weights)
And I had some normie mid girls approach me but I just declined both times 
The type of women I'm into doesn't exist so I can just cope my entire life with being not normal (this entire society is not normal though)
If you're even considering going gay as an option I have some bad news for you
I mean op is doing everything except doing the thing that would make him get a gf 
Of course he even though about going gay or even shit like necrophilia but he didn't write that
You are not a,real man if you are shy, so why do you feel entitled to be treated as one?
i dont really think so.
the dudes i've seen who were like that but got married since the 60s and 70s were a completely different time ended up with emasculating shrews.

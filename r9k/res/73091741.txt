I have 2 gfs simultaneously, and I'm finally 'content' I suppose, but I still feel like an incel and am not truly happy. I get sex at least everyday, sometimes twice a day, but none of these 2 women will ever really love me, and I don't really love them. They are both late 20s and have body counts of around 10. gf A knows about gf B and is fine with it, but gf B doesn't know about gf A

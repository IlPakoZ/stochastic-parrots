parents constantly complain about work and how much it sucks for my entire childhood
is surprised I dont want to work at all.
Like they taught me some valuable lessons and I dont intend on repeating their mistakes. Plus my life is already miserable and dont want to add more BS on top of it.

my parents constantly complain and tell me to never get married lol tho they seem much more lax with finding work. Are they getting angry or telling you to find a job, threatening to kick you out? What about them being surprised do you mean?

They want me to get a job, Im trying to go through vocational rehabilitation for autism and ADHD so that I can delay the process longer.

See parents
See them struggling make ends meet to pay off their debts. Still getting into even with the amount they make
Dad continously tells me to study and be smart to not do any of the work
Also told me to never get in debt ever
Always living in shared rooms. 
Finally decide to be smart and save money by doing nothing since we cant afford shit
Get yelled, berated, have my stuff stolen, harrassed by them, and my privacy constantly invaded because I wasnt "trying hard enough" in school to apply myself
doesnt realize that a majority of the programs I would like to take has a fee
Always threw fits when I asked if they could take me to an acadmeic meet or something that would benefit me. Dont question it, again, because money is tight
Couldnt leave the house because they thought I would just be trouble and fuck things up meaning money out of their pocket to fix
Graduate with one honor from HS. Was berated by my dad for not doing "better"
Stay inside and dont do anything but play video games. Family still berates me and harrasses me to do better.
Gee, I wonder why Im so "lazy"

This might not be something you want to hear, but there's a good chance your parents are exactly like you for the exact same reasons, and never managed to get over it.
You've noticed the pattern, OP. Now is your chance to break the cycle of neglect and become free and independent. If you're as miserable and unmotivated as you say then there's a good chance they failed to teach you some important lessons - likely because they never learned those themselves. Still, remind yourself that despite their flaws they at least tried.

There is no freedom in this world. Except the freedom to choose death.

Why would people who constantly complain about their life then go on to make children fully intending for them to do the same thing?

there is no freedom in this world, but there can be freedom in your mind

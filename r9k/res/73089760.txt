I'm not usually one to talk back because I believe it's just a waste of time and you can always find common ground, but this morning I woke up with no patience at all 
My dad is in bad terms with my mom, so he's trying to build better habits around home such as regular cleaning. 
I work a WFH job and I wake up pretty early. First thing he does is to yell at me because my bathroom didn't smell like roses. Then he refuses to make breakfast (he's unemployed and my brother and I are paying everything from rent to food) because he's "busy" cleaning up the house 
My brother reluctantly goes to make breakfast, and dad asks him to take the clothes out from where they were drying because they could get some undesired odors. My brother refuses and tells him to do it himself, and it escalates to verbal aggression
He gets out of the kitchen and turns his attention to me, and that's where I exploded 
I called him a tyrant and a child, and that if he wasn't my father I'd have beaten him up already. That he's destroyed his relationships with 3 out of his 4 children and he's already losing me with these episodes. That he's a divorced man with another divorce incoming and doing laundry won't stop that unless he fundamentally changes his anger issues 
I feel bad about it but I never straight up insulted him. I told him the truth. He has no excuse for what's he's doing. He has no responsibilities, I'm paying for everything. I really thought that once he was relieved from that burden he'd become a kinder man but this is just how he is. 
I really tried to hold back but everyone has limits

Well you handled it better than I would have. A better person than me

I think you were justified desu, maybe it wasn't the "right" thing to do but he had it coming and he should know this, he needed a reality check.
How did he react when you said it? I'm curious.

He got quiet and is currently in his room. Before that he told my brother this was his fault because he didn't do what he was told

Hopefully this will give him so introspection, but as someone with a shitty parent myself he'll probbaly just sulk for a while and eventually go back to his old ways, but one can always hope.
I think if you really feel terrible, you should apologise, yeah maybe he's a piece of shit slob that doesn't deserve an apology, but it doesn't really matter, you acted in a way you see unacceptable to another person and you should make things right, even that person is an awful person.

well done anon. Don't feel bad about standing your ground even with your parents. sounds like your dad needs a wake up call and you only told him the truth. You only feel bad cause youre kind- so dont retract what you said or he'll just use that against you. Apologise for hurting his feelings but let him know that you meant what you said. Hopefully something comes of it but perhaps not, usually people just fall back into their own ways so keep pressure on the issue if you find him doing so. Is there anything you can do to help him out anyway?

I was just about to post this exactly. Let him know that everything you said was true, but you're sorry for blowing up on him.

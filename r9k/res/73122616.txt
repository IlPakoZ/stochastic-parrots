paying your taxes as a poor person is funny. its like "yup, i still own nothing. and how much money i get back decides how hungry i will be for the next few months".

Damn, I wish people had hatchet fights in the street where I lived. Honestly, that's some apocalyptic raiders shit or something. I would watch it from the sidelines regularly

Poor people paying taxes is more like a participation trophy. 90% of all income tax is paid by the top 10% of earners. Poor people are massive net consumers of tax revenue and never leave the state of being indebted to the government. 
Poor people (by which I mean the bottom 50% of earners, if not more) contribute absolutely nothing to society. 
Even most of their jobs could have been automated decades ago.

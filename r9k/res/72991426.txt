Wtf happened to Destiny?

I don't mind older people in there 40+ on twitch and in streaming. Makes sense it's the way our world is unfolding. What I can't help but laugh at is the dudes who are 30+ and still try to BE a teenager. Dye their hair blue, say all the hip and cool lingo, play the current shooter with their fans. Shit just comes off like a midlife crisis instead of a Livestream

But Keemstar is funny

He really isn't. He's braindead.
Destiny just does it because it's funny to have conservatives view him as a stereotypical blue-haired libtard. idk what this Ethan Ralph dude is doing. I know he's some far-right retard or whatever.

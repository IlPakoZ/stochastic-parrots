Am I a moid? What is a moid anyway?
 Be me
 24
 Intense preference for enormous boobs, even though it's rare IRL
 But IRL chicks are cute too, and tall chicks have their own appeal
 Too paranoid of unintentionally hurting someone though, regardless of how
 Virgin and single because of this paranoia, now everyone my age is either a single male or dating someone.

Cute way of swerving your own bullshit. It's called self-awareness homie.

What is a moid anyway? 
XY chromosome disorder. Debilitating condition that causes severe cognitive deficiency and random outbursts of violence

Femoid is a term for wimminz, often shortened to foid. Moid is the male counterpart. They're usually used in a somewhat negative way but can also just be general. That's about it.

Well, yeah, duh
I believe it's more upbringing than genetic with only cases of too much Test being the exception. There needs to be programs to teach boys healthy ways to deal with anger rather than holding it in till we boil over in violent outbursts like our fathers might.
Gotcha, thanks anon.

No. Males are the pit bulls of gender; you can train them however much you want and one individual can go it's whole life with little to no history of aggression, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a very good chance of just snapping one day and metaphorically mauling a toddler.

Doesn't that go for anyone these days? There's a place near me that lets you destroy shit for $30, all you want for half an hour. Their main clientel are all women.
Everyone's so fucked or strained mentally I'm amazed we haven't collapsed yet as a society.

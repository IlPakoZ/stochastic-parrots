White people also think this, it's why so many people "liked" Donald Trump in spite of what a piece of shit he was even to his supporters.

Sure, and you're hoping people will tell you it's okay to be racist. I recommend suicide instead.

It the same reason why people here argue and throw fits at any sign of disagreement. The internet and modern pop culture has encouraged an angry and violent populace. There's a reason why governing bodies historically have had more control over their people. You can't see the harm of acting like a retard when all you do is work and go home to jack off.

If you want to talk about the Donald, riddle me this, fagman, why did he pardon Lil' Wayne, a convicted nigger, but not pardon the QAnon Shaman, who was the face of his fucking movement in every media outlet in the world? Oh, right, because Trump is a fucking retard nigger himself, and only your knee-jerk chimp-brain loyalty to what you think is your "in group" keeps you from realizing that. How's the suicide coming along, you need any help?

It's to absolve themselves from guilt.

Because they'd be pretending if they acted politely and they've been hearing all their lives that they need to be themselves and not pretend to be something their not. 
It's not like their TRYING to be rude, they just naturally are

Who are these "black people"? I've interacted with many who are really polite and friendly.

Because the QAnon shaman was violent alt right terrorist, while the other is just regular black rapper lol

Black people are just rude 
But I guess pretending to be nice to someone you dislike is dishonest

Niggers are literally less evolved, trying to understand them as a non-nigger is pointless.

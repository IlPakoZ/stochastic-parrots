man I wish I had applied to be on fishtank, I would be having a blast
I wouldn't be able to handle all the cameras around.
this anon is correct D:
Aren't they constant being harassed by TTS
Only for like 20 minutes a day.
They're not really that rude from what I heard.
I don't care if people are spamming nigger retard at me from tts.
Yeah it's a good deal. I would be vastly more entertaining than those retards too. 99.9% of the stream is insanely boring
fish tank seems like some brainfart social experiment meant to scam people. I think sam is finally starting to actually lose it.
I don't blame Sam for constantly bullying them for being poor, 10k is nothing to be made a clown of and pace around vaping for weeks. I wouldn't do that if I had 0 dollars.

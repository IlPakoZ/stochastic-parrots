anyone wanna play csgo or zomboid?
<comment>
looking to play zomboid with someone too, i enjoy vanilla but not opposed to trying out a modded server. what servers do you play on if any?

I played on a custom private server one time but that was it

Might be willing to play PZ but I need to see what mods are broken since I didn't touch it in a year or two. Also what else do you play besides those? Drop steam/discord or something and I'll think about it (most likely won't because most anons on /r9k/ suck).

I can't believe how bad my partner fucked me on this assignment. Waited until 2 hours before it was due to write the code, didn't even compile it before pushing it to github, then told me it was done. It had so many syntax errors, segfaults, and infinite loops that it's fuckimg hilarious. I'm already behind in this class too and now my grade is completely fucked and I'll have to retake this shitty class Fuck you D. Seriously fuck you.

I had already done my part on Thursday. I have no fucking clue what to do now. I'm gonna fail at least two classes this semester.

Perhaps you should not have been behind in the class in the first place.

Tell the teacher your partner fucked up their half and ask if you can have a few days to do their half too so you dont fail the course. They will probably be sympathetic. They might just say they will grade each half individually, but if you say youre willing to do the work it will sound better.

Yeah shitty group members suck. As a rule you should be prepared to do all the work yourself if it comes to it. I will literally spam a group member's phone to remind them to do their part, I don't give a fuck. If they don't respond I'll email my professor and just do all the work myself. It sucks but that's how it goes.

I'm fucking tired of working wagie jobs and am about to KMS. Any tips on faking becoming bad enough to get NEETbucks? Anyone know how to find unethical doctors who could diagnose me with something to get unemployment or some shit?
the secret is to become homeless
just work security. Basically the neet's dream job. Watch anime for 8 hours, occasionally walk around. Whatever, dude. Personally i like to git more gud at drawing while I work.

The human brain is such a marvelous tool, and it goes to waste here.
It is indeed possible to unravel the mysteries of the universe with your brain. You can discover that when you touch grass, you dont actually touches. The electromagnetic fields of your finger's surface atoms repel the grass's field. Then you realize that subatomic particles are basically just vibration, a mathematical wave form. What you once thought was physical is metaphysical. The entire universe around you is merely a language, with its own syntax. And because your conscious mind is intertwined with the reality that it perceives, nothing stops you from writing down the syntax.
Yet, you'd rather gossip about celebrities and demand more funny memes.

Every person in the world has the power to learn everything about modern physics.
It's all there with one click of a button.
But it's one click too much, because Tiktok is also one click away.

That shit is hard to understand even with a teacher. Even if you somehow "understand" which is just memorizing it then you wouldnt be able to do anything with it because it takes high IQ and expensive equipment to make scientific breakthroughs.

I know. One of the issues with physical and mathematical knowledge is that it takes a lot to understand it. Every year kids are less inclined to go down that path because the dopamine yield is so little compared to the dopamine yield from video games and social shit. This dynamic will ensure that in the future nobody will understand anything about physics.
I spent 3-5 years trying to grasp just the absolute basics of classical physics. The first years I accidentally just memorized everything and mistook it for learning it. All those years I was in fact learning how to learn physics. Taking long breaks actually helped me more than forceful cramming. In the end it's all about learning about your own brain and teaching yourself to become the type of person who can discover those natural laws by themselves. You absolutely do not learn by looking at words on a book unless you're already at a level where the content is self-explainatory to you.
I'm rambling here and there's no good conclusion to come to, but I guess my point is that yes, there's a reason why people avoid physics. But at the same time it's the only school subject that makes you grow as a person and teaches you problem solving skills.

All that but replace physics with philosophy.

Too bad philosophy doesnt have formulas.

You could be le epic depressed Rick scientist
Or you can be a bliss normie and enjoy your 80 years on earth
99% of robots and redditors pick the wrong choice

I just cant enjoy meaningless social media gossip and tiktak videos.

Then thangs are Midwit shit though. Real low iq niggas watch sports or shounen anime/cartoons.

Bruh.
The more you learn about physics, the more you realize that physicists are just describing what they see. Nobody knows why photons behave like spinny demons. It's just what we've noticed.

Hasnt everything in physics been discovered already? Like the theory of everything.

Why do you believe in Langan's bullshit?
<comment>
Nobody knows how quantum physics and classical physics really go together.

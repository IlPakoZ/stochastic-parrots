I'm 31 and I want a cute girlfriend at least 10 years younger than me. It's killing me how bad I want this and how taboo it is with Gen z. I genuinely am only attracted to girls under 22
Why is she wearing a key? She has a femdom cock-cage onlyfans, doesn't she?
I'm 26 and I feel the same way. Girls over 22 just don't do it for me
Just get a fambot. Zoomers already are feminized by the food and water, so they make amazing traps
Surely some of them have the instinct to rebel against conventionally held mores. Or has social media put a stop to such things? Through criticisms of "pickmes" and the like.
26 also. My roastie friend gave me shit for showing interest in the 18 years old zoomette in my class kek.
Nailed it. There's more groupthink in women than ever. Modern young women detest older men
Go for her if you want to. Do not care about the opinion of those older roasties. They've had their chance to bag a good man at that age too and missed it.
Because it's cute you weird retarded coomer
And get called a creep. Kek. It's over.
You might as well top yourself then instead of sitting on here going "oh boohoo it's over for me boohoooooo :,("
and what are you going to do when your 22 year old girlfriend is 32?
Theyre fine with dating older men, just not you.
I'm 28 and have a 24 year old girlfriend and several others before that, but I still would probably drop everything for a 18-21 year old.
Doesn't help that I was dating girls in their late 20s when I was 18-22.

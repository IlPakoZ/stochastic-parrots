i had the realization today that i am the only person in my entire office of 70 people that is single. let alone that, but the idea of being a virgin, the math of how far behind i am my peers has been overwhelming on my psyche and thought of existence 
what did we do to deserve this fate? why will no one help us? are you worth the matter you are printed on if you are unloveable? is it worth it to wake up tomorrow? i cannot help but feel doom lingering over me

Better not tell anyone in the office about this, Lindsey in HR sure wouldn't like knowing that one of the employees is a dangerous incel non-sex-haver.

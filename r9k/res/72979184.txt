It's awesome I loved the coworkers at my last job they were young and nerdy so we'd talk about vidya and anime all the time even if it was on a basic level and everyone got along
Now I've to work with a >60yo dude, a 35yo single woman and a zoomer who tries her hardest to be a stacy jesus it's horrible they complain and talk shit about everything all the time making the time at work even more miserable

Andrew Jackson was based. Fuck the Native Americans. If they were meant to live the universe wouldn't have allowed them to be nearly annihilated by pussy ass diseases

Jackson hung out with the war chief of the Creeks after the war and would bet on horses with him. Jackson also adopted a native child. War is just war, and he was good at it. You're just as much of an ignorant faggot as the rest of them.

im a lesbian, but i wanna dom a femboy. am i still a lesbian or..?
<comment>
you're a gay faggot either way whats the difference?
<comment>
You are still les but you are not for me
It would make me harder if you wanted to dom a passing pre-op tranny but femboys are just androgenous men like Prince and that shit is gay as hell and boring
<comment>
 You are still les
thats all i needed to hear, thanks bro
<comment>
Depends on how much "fem" we are talking desu. People are calling themselves everything.
<comment>
You are bi like all women
<comment>
okay im talking like, long hair makeup type shit. basically futa without tits
<comment>
It depends, are they HRT femboys or just plain twinks?
<comment>
hmmm, id be open to both i think
<comment>
basically futa without tits
but the tits are the best part, whether they're natural little ones that pre-teen girls would have or fake ones that 90s movie actresses would have

Damn, so don't even need hrt to get messed up in bed by a lesbian? Brb, gonna go shave off all my body hair and look up a youtube tutorial on makeup.

I'd probably dress like a girl if it meant sitting on a lesbian's lap and kissing with her
<comment>
kinda strange kinda odd
<comment>
i don't think it's that strange. not dysphoric or anything, just think it's sensual

A lot of us secretly want to be women.
If you wanted you could probably pick out random shy looking male autists on dating websites and turn them into femboys for your personal amusement.

Do any fembots go to local video game tournaments?
i used to go to fighting game tournaments, everyone was nice but i got spooked by one bad egg and just decided to stop going.
Imagine playing video games competitively instead of just for fun.
not being bad at games is fun
People who aren't bad at games should use their skills to carry their friends in co-op.
I just wanted a lock of your hair, it's not like u didnt have plenty already you uppity bitch
No but you'll find a bunch of cute femboys and trannies at the Melty Blood station

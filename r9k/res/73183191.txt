It just doesnt make sense, why are feet so seductive?
they imply the woman not being standing, therefore seeing soles is the ultimate sign of submission. also unconsciously it simbolizes the bottom of the body, where sexual energy dwells. women communicate lower body desires with their feet
these are mens feet 1000%
It's not fair that I'll never get to try sex with a smooth guy dressed in cute girl clothes

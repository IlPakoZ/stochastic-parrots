It feels so dehumanizing to be a male sometimes
<comment>
Just sometimes?
<comment>
It's nice when you get distracted by something so you no longer think about it for a while
<comment>
nah, it doesn't desu
<comment>
how come it doesn't for you?
<comment>
I feel exactly the same.
My genes aren't good enough so I don't even get to be a human. The last time I felt like one was elementary school.
<comment>
Fuck genes.
What matters really, is environment.
You could be a retarded brainless baby and while your parents could put you up like a freakshow attraction, fact is you get love and support, and most importantly money.
Imagine being a retard baby who was undercooked (IE: premature) and not having such a support chain. Worse yet? You're born in a faggier, meaner, soulless version of New York.
Now imagine said retard baby being born to a bunch of xenophobic hoarding abusive incestuous hicks that think special needs programs are an op run by the FBI or just lobitomy-happy sadist Drs.
You don't see it, but when your environment is bad, good genes don't matter.
My best friend who was as social as a capybara got cirrhosis because he drinks to cope with his miserable existence. He was built like Thor, but has none of the godly liver.

At the end of the day, even in the best environment you'd still be a retard.
And your friend became an alcoholic because he has genes that predispose him to alcoholism.

I got a laptop when I was 10. That was the beginning of the end, because pretty soon I was staying up all night watching anime and youtube, skipping school the next day because I was so tired. Now I'm 24 and I still do pretty much the same thing.
Wish I grew up in the pre-internet era desu.

You're 24, you did this to yourself. I'm 21 and even I remember a time when the internet didn't take over peoples lives lol.
All you had to do was just not be addicted to your laptop and maybe join a sport or something.
At least take some responsibility for your actions, or do something useful with your life.
I've been addicted to technology since I was 6 but at least I'm good with tech now and getting a PhD.

why aren't you getting some bitches?

Just don't be addicted bro. 
And I was 17 when I realized what I was doing. I changed my diet and started working out, but even assuming I could have been saved had I started earlier, the damage was already done. My body was done growing. I'm lanky, my body is unmasculinized, I have gynecomastia, and to top it all off I have an ugly face.
Also not everyone has a high IQ. Just get a phd bro.

Women actually like intelligent guys that dress nice, despite what some on this board may try to peddle.

Yeah, if you actually wanted to and put your mind to it you probably could, assuming you don't have learning issues.
I graduated High School with like a 2.0 GPA or something because I was lazy and depressed.
I saw college as a chance to start clean again and escape my family. So I went and got a 4.0 and entered the PhD program.

How ugly? You might be able to lean into that and become a decent looking tranny if you're already not very masculine and spontaneously grew breasts without even using female hormones to do that.
Could probably get laid with bisexual girls on dating apps that way.

If those 2 are the same person I'm terrified. How can anyone tell a teanny from a real girl at that point
<comment>
I wish I was truly androgynous - a change of clothes, hair style and application of makeup away from being able to perfectly pass as either gender depending on my mood that day.
That'd be so kino, bros.
Unfortunately, I'm super tall and male
But alas it's my ultimate impossible fantasy
<comment>
Your body is a part of your environment

Most of them keep their dicks so it'll be pretty obvious once you start having sex with one.
Also though almost all of them will tell you up front because they don't want to deal with a guy who hates trannies chimping out on them.
<comment>
tranny shill
please stop trying to spread this illness to easily manipulated men.
<comment>
Do we really want easily manipulated men in the gene pool?
<comment>
No, I like trannies and will create more of them and then masturbate to them when they start camwhoring.
<comment>
That's the point, retard
If you're stupid enough to try transitioning even though you don't feel like you should, you deserve the consequences
<comment>
wake up
go to work
barely interact with coworkers in office job (they're all boomers)
clock out
paycheck isn't high enough to move out of parents home
go to the gym
work out undisturbed
nothing else to do, everyone I know is busy being an adult
come home to a family that doesn't appreciate me
go to sleep for work the next day
said maybe 100 words the whole day
will likely say less tomorrow
yeah I'm thinking it's mid 20's male time

Women hate intelligent guys because smart guys are not risk takers they think too much this makes them predictable and boring to the animalistic subhuman foid brain. This is why niggers who speak at 1000 decibels and blab whatever retarded crap their brain conjures up the next second later are always surrounded by white foids they love stupid fucks.

Because those aren't random photos, they're carefully picked to show her in her best light when she's the most passable. On the street you would see the manjaw from a mile away

At 21 you're still a kid. Lots of us were immature and thought like you but we grew out of it as we grew up. You'll grow up too and cringe at the kind of stuff you wrote here if you ever mature enough for it. Good luck kiddo.

Are you talking about women or dumb roasties who can't do simple math?
It's rare but women can be intelligent too, its usually because they have autism or something.
But even roastie women will hit on me if they know about my academic status since they want to try my type I suppose.
I reject them because I don't believe in sex before marriage. Not quite but still, I'm waiting until I'm in a solid relationship with a fellow intellect.
<comment>
21
Still a kid
Why are Americans like this?
<comment>
I think most people are intimidated by someone who can see thrugh them, i wouldn't take anything personaly, most people are dumb af nowadays, especially under 30. Immature sluts that tweak.
<comment>
iktf. i want to be able to dress handsomely and pretty. i hate my body hair. i hate my face hair. i wish i could get away with wearing baggy pink hoodies and not look like a massive fag.
<comment>
Because Im not kek
<comment>
you're a female on r9k who doesn't hate men? what the fuck are you doing here?
<comment>
that's why I transitioned

How come? I don't understand these people. This seems like a low-IQ stance.

Please go back to plebbit if you can't understand why promiscuity is bad for society lol.
Everything in the modern world is designed to drag people away from each other, America is becoming more and more of a shithole
Sociologists have been warning us about promiscuity for the past 30 years.
It lowers happiness and increases divorce rates. Sex is best with someone you love, not some used up roastie you don't care about.

why do you want the le family and kids?
have you considered it beyond just a foolish idealistic dream life situation?
are you even capable of the emotional gymnastics required for it?
you will argue with your wife
you will get bored of your wife
your wife will look at other men
you will hate your wife like the boomers did
your kids will be tik tok zooms x1000
do you want to wake up at 3 fucking am to change shitty diapers for months on end?
could you handle your kids being their own persons? (you might not like who they become)
there are a ludicrous amount of things about having a family that are actual hell and not that many good things beyond the hollywood romanticized idea of it
inb4 le die alone
inb4 le meaning
inb4 le evolutionary purpose

Everything except the tiktok part existed before internet and people did just fine. Most people have become manchildren raised on Video games and Television.

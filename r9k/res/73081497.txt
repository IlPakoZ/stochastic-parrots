Im still myself
huh? I'm still in my own body
Since I'm not even sure who I hate the most, it would actually be a surprise no matter who it was
I commit suicide. hehe 2 birds, 1 stone
Commit various heinous crimes to make my enemy look horrible and then I kill myself, not sure what rules apply here if I can go back to my original body or if I'm permanently in my enemy's body for the rest of my life
yeah, same. tho it propably would be my mother.
When they are themselves the next day and I'm back in my body, maybe they'll change their ways.

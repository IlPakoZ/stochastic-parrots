you wake up in the body of the person you hate most
what now?
<comment>
Im still myself
<comment>
huh? I'm still in my own body
<comment>
Since I'm not even sure who I hate the most, it would actually be a surprise no matter who it was

I commit suicide. hehe 2 birds, 1 stone
<comment>
Commit various heinous crimes to make my enemy look horrible and then I kill myself, not sure what rules apply here if I can go back to my original body or if I'm permanently in my enemy's body for the rest of my life

make them go to church
help the homeless
generally be a good person
When they are themselves the next day and I'm back in my body, maybe they'll change their ways.

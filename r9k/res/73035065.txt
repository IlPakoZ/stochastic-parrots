Anyone else a recluse not necessarily due to anxiety, but wanting to protect other people? I know I'm a pretty unpleasant dude. So I tend to stick to myself so others don't get bothered.

yeah i feel like people just simply don't like me, i don't know what it is about me but people just seem disgusted by me upon first meeting fairly consistently. it makes me very sad

Same. I used to think it's just because I'm ugly, but I get the same lack of interest and outright dislike online too. Really not sure of what it is.

maybe people are just simply mean, i dunno, its easy to think people are only mean to you but maybe everyone just has a shit attitude nowadays. then again i even see friend groups at work. i sit and eat alone though cause honestly i don't even like socializing in groups, it gives me anxiety

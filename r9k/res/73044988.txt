Everyday when I look in the mirror i feel so much hatred and abhorrence towards myself. My face is extremely asymmetrical, side profile is ruined by my big hideous nose and everything about my self apparence is displeasing. I geniunely dislike my red short hair and my small brown eyes with its big dark circles. I avoid smiling in public since my teeth are crooked and I look worse than I already am. 
The only way I used to cope with this was wearing makeup. I felt so pretty with makeup before even though that kind of make up made me look uglier. But now I realised even make up cant hide my insecurities and uglyness..I feel guilt using makeup to fix my imperfections. I dont want to feed capitalist coorporates with my silly insecurities. 
I envy girls who are pretty,smart and have a good sense of personality.
I suck almost at everything. I have low contrencation and never discipline myself. I spend most of my day doing absolute nothing but daydream. Im lost in a world full with delusions imagining the better version of me but I never do something in real life to improve myself. Its completely my fault Im this way. Everytime someone shows a little interest in me I distance myself because they deserve better. I have no communication skills and I stutter while talking. I barely have any friend irl since I dont know to get a convorsation going. 
I wish i could be anyone but me.

The only reason i dont blow my brains off is because I believe life will get better at some point.. Right?
<comment>
Please dont let me go crazy and talk with myself

red short hair
Dislike your hair length? Why not just grow it out?
Anyway, the big problem with hating your appearance is thinking that your appearance is the real issue. You need to learn how to get your self confidence from another source. I'd recommend you not say things like "I wish i could be anyone but me" because they reinforce your negative self image.
<comment>
Im trying to grow out but i have utopian standarts. It needs years to arrive to my desired length. Ive cutted my hair many times even though I always wanted very ling layered hair. 
I get your point but how can i get self confidence from any other source when I barely have a personality?

There are many who are like you except with the additional disadvantage of being male.
<comment>
Ahhh i meant to post without name fuck im fucked
<comment>
you are underage. just get the fuck off this board
<comment>
How is it a disavantage being a male?
I tried.
<comment>
Buy the makeup, make yourself pretty and go easily get your attention from males your biology craves and accept it. We want you to be happy and get the fuck off this board and never come back ever again whore
<comment>
I already do this and sometimes I get attention from men online. Doesnt change anything, since I know they would bully be the once they know me irl.

As long as you're female, males are attracted to you.
<comment>
As long as youre a male, females are attracted to you aswell
<comment>
The experiences of most people on this board would suggest otherwise.
Makeup is overrated.
Only a small subset of men bully, and even that diminishes as they get older.

You're typing whole paragraphs and shit. Do you have any idea how much better your communication skills are compared to those of the average person? Most people literally grunt and fart to express themselves. You have a soul, not everybody does, don't write that off.
<comment>
just base a aesthetic around yourself. people often find themselves scared and lost because they dont have something they see themselves as. The only way you can get around it is to realize you really arnt ugly or something, its to realize you are apart of something different. people wanna be apart of mainstream because mainstream tries to bully them to be in it causing issues. This board is a drop hole for people stuck outside, most need just a little help. My entire aesthetic is machining, i dress, drive, walk, talk, like one even though i wasnt born into it. I found my aesthetic, just find yours robot. unrel pic.
<comment>
Is this more accurate?
<comment>

Gender doesnt matter. Also most of the time its men who go for the looks. 
Thank you my fren but Im not this talkactive in real life. Its hard expressing what I have to say since i get nervous around people thats why I avoid communicating. Also i dont know how to get a convosation going.
<comment>
Thank you Anon for the suggestion :D I used to do this before and I felt happier. However I changed since i would get harrased many times (by my make up style, clothes) so i turned basic as in apparence :p 
Yes expect im not a mouth breather
<comment>
harass back. thats the only way i put myself solidly into place. i dont have discipline or anything i just decided, fuck it. You can do it, just dont bark; shits stupid. embrace it to the end. imperial japanese type shit.
<comment>
I wish I had the balls to talk back.
<comment>
Impossible to find it. Also drugs are very gay
<comment>
Make sure to keep whining and crying on /r9k/ about things you can't change and things that you don't care enough to change.
I'm sure that will make you feel more confident and help you progress in life.
<comment>
anon the way you describe yourself makes you sound plenty fine. its hard not to hone in on our perceived flaws. i hope you can live comfortably as yourself someday
<comment>
Definetly being here helps me progress in life. 
I really hope the same for myself. I just wanna be comfortable with myself without caring so much what other people think.
Thank for being nice!
This board has improved a little since my threads before would gain much more hate

No.... so youre saying its over..
<comment>

Male is the "high risk, high reward" build. A man is expected to be strong, successful and in control of his emotions. Nowadays women are encouraged to be successful too but it's okay if they don't, they can even be housewives. Showing weakness and submissiveness isn't seen as negative, in fact it can make you more attractive. You will always get attention or have sex with guys better looking than you. And while finding a stable relationship can be difficult, it's easier than doing so as a man.
<comment>
No.... so youre saying its over..
time as we know it is an illusion. things can never be over because they never truly end, nor do they truly begin.
just know that nothing is your fault because free will is also an illusion. and know that you're really pretty.
<comment>
Would you send me a picture on discord? I'm kinda curious.
<comment>
If you're a female (i dont have time for this thread i need to eat some food), just kill yourself, you almost certainly deserve to die anyway. godspeed, dont post again, fuck you cunt.
<comment>
Thank you so much! And youre 100% right, I just have to change my mindset and see things in other prespective. 
I used to post myself here frequently lol
I will post again as long jannies dont ban me
<comment>
I used to post myself here frequently lol
Can you reference one of those posts?
<comment>
This photo is a bit old. My hair is way different now. I cut it very short and its the same length as there now but different style (without layers) and its red. 
Posting myself here again its completely a mistake but im bored. Fuck I hate boredom
<comment>
Im a dumbass i posted with a namw again. I have short term memory aswell and forget to remove this shit
<comment>
You are cute, you just have self-perception and insecurity issues. Stop it with the drama.
<comment>
The only "negative" thing I noticed, only because you brought it up, is that your nose is a bit too big compared to the ideal. That's it. You're actually pretty cute. I kinda had an inkling that'd be the case, given how you also describe yourself as having no communication skills--while communicating clearly.
The way you perceive yourself is warped, anon.
<comment>
You're beautiful
I don't think your nose is too big and if it is, it fits your face nicely. So it doesn't look bad at all.
<comment>
Thanks Anon, but only the only people who think im cute its just the internet. Most of the time ive been bullied for my looks so no matter what people say now wont change my preception of myself.
<comment>
Thanks i am quite beautiful arent i? I would say im the hottest egirl here hehe
<comment>
When were you bullied and by whom?
<comment>
only the only people who think im cute its just the internet. Most of the time ive been bullied for my looks
I had the same problem growing up. I can only say that getting older has made me care less about people's opinions.
<comment>
posts a long paragraph about how ugly she is
Thanks i am quite beautiful arent i? I would say im the hottest egirl here hehe
hmmmm
<comment>
Oh shit, you're the underage bitch. Everyone, OP is underage. Do not engage.
<comment>
Damn fuck off man youre not me. I dont wanna deal with you impersonating tards again. 
When I was young by my classmates. Now no one bothers me though but idk if its a good thing since I feel ignored. Atleast then people talked to me even if it was in a negative way. 
Communicating in the internet is easy not comparable with in real life. The only way i can keep on convos with ppl irl only if theyre interesed in politics and history. 
However thanks anon thats nice
Thanks so much. Idk what to say now i feel guilty posting myself here.
Feels like attention whoring
<comment>
Thats not me lmfao. Isnt it too hard to understand
<comment>
Isnt it too hard to understand
you're right, it is too hard to understand
<comment>
When I was young by my classmates
1. Assuming your classmates were "right" to mock you, your appearance might have drastically changed since then. Lots of cute girls used to be ugly ducklings.
2. Kids will say whatever sticks. Insulting someone's appearance is the easiest go-to. I'm a tall guy and have been mocked for being tall as a kid, even though it's the most universal attractive traits for men. That's just how retarded it is.They'll use anything they can and try to make an insult out of it. They will double down if you react. That's all it is.

Are you willing to talk about stuff your less knowledgeable about and just ask questions if need be?
<comment>
I dont think ive changed much since then. Its been only like 1-2 years. Been mocked about my apparence online aswell. 
Anyways i should just change the way how I think. People nowdays are very judgemental. Ive seen godness looking women get called ugly.
<comment>

Well, you answer yourself, then. If you can see it for others, know it's the same for you. Idk that I'd call you a godess, but I'd be a happy man to have a gf as cute as you.

Personality is what matters after all
<comment>
I need to be attracted to the girl to see her as a potential mate and not just a person. Otherwise, she'll be a friend and nothing more. Once you do have that base attraction, personality and character are what matter most, though. Don't need to be a goddess, just attractive enough. And in your case, you're actually more than "good enough" when it comes to that, imo.
<comment>
Thank you Anon. Im going to sleep right now since its late. I hope i dont find myself posting here again, its not good for my brain. Goood night sleep well

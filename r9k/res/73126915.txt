Since this place is normie central now, has anyone had experience with having a kinky girlfriend?
Jabba sage. Also you are a faggot.
What do you define as kinky
A lot of normal relationship shit is considered kinky to FA ppl (ex: a girl doing anything aside from being a fleshlight during sex = gentle femdom)
I mean more real kinky. Latex, less mainstream BDSM, piss, that kind of stuff.

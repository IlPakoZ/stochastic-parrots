When I was a kid I wanted to be a rabbi but my uncle told me I wouldn't get any pussy if I was so I gave up on that dream. Now I both don't get any pussy AND I missed out on the most realistic dream I had. Fuck him.

You could've just became a hasidic rabbi and molest teenage/prepubescent boys and girls. Heard you guys have a knack for that

Being a rabbit isn't realistic at all.

Only evil people want to be a rabbi. You must be a horrible person.

Rabbi is an insane career path, you make like 100k per year according to indeed. The rabbinical training is expensive but you'll be able to pay it off. just don't be completely retarded and incapable of communication and you should do pretty good. fuck getting pussy too, if you're a rabbi you get a wife.

And all in costs is your soul and eternal damnation

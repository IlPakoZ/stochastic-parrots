God does not want you to shower, ever!! It removes the natural smells of your body which are necessary for communication.
When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with water, and he will be unclean till evening.
Leviticus 15:16
The only thing smelling like rancid BO will communicate will be "stay away from me and my virginity"

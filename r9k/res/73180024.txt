Men can love one woman even if she's not attractive. But women can only love Chad and if they don't have Chad they need so many guys to juggle around and they still won't be satisfied anyway. There's no hope

i mean, when we were together guys would be jealous and make it known. when it became ldr without our choice i was young and insecure and would complain to him about guys trying to encroach on his territory. i wasn't purposely trying to make him feel bad i genuinely missed him

Well, talking about boys hitting on you will make your bf jealous. It looks like you say it to warn him about your multiple choices.
If your partner is insecure about the relationship and does not trust you then he is better off.
You could also be doing other things to make him jealous, like having a super close male friend, don't showing him in general (no hand-holding nor kisses in public). Talking about how other people are prettier and what not.
Yes it's pity but you would feel the same way, maybe you wouldn't act on it tho.
The fact that it got into a ldr also doesn't help.

well, i aint your man since i am fat and ugly af.

that wasn't my intention. :( i was saying it because i was longing for him, to verbalize how much i missed him.
then why would he admit to someone he missed me? i would unironically marry and have his babies if he wanted to. but having babies is a scary subject to need real love/commitment.
i used to have a close guy friend and even a girl friend, and she would argue with my ex about me and it was really damaging to my psyche. i cut the guy friend and girl off from my life after realizing how toxic they were years after breaking up.
i scrubbed my socials and have pictures of us on there but set to private. i actually have a secret folder of us i made of all our pictures together. he would claim me as his in comments and and i would post stuff about us and he did of me as well. he'd tease me in pictures of us asking if it was a problem he was taking up most of the space etc. I'd never cheat though. he has celebrity crushes but so do i so it's not really real you know?
i moved back and tried reaching out to him but haven't gotten a reply yet. i'm wondering what's going through his mind atm
<comment>
then why would he admit to someone he missed me?
Because he might, but doesn't want to go back. At least, I can see myself in that position.
I still miss my ex, almost a year later, but I would not want to go back with her, this is for the better.
Sorry, but maybe if you really really really want to make sure and you didn't already, call him instead of texting, doing it multiple times would be hard to ignore. But yeah. Good luck anyway my gay friend.

i admit this is very depressing for me anon. it's like, why did that person bother mentioning it to me :/ 
how many times is multiple? i wonder if that would just make things worse? not sure if I'm feeling too confident/comfortable and now i'm frightened again. kinda like how he was i guess.

Ayyy, we're the same but it's been 2 years. I really miss my ex but we weren't good for each other and I think we're better off apart. I wonder if she misses me or feel the pains.
<comment>
how many times is multiple?
until he picks up?
i wonder if that would just make things worse?
worse than no talking about it? I mean he can think you are an asshole for not taking a no, but if he loved you and he misses you I wouldn't jump to that conclution. I would be angry if I didn't want anything more from you tho, but I wouldn't be angry with some past couples.
I wonder if she misses me or feel the pains.
Mine sometimes tweets about something I said or did, although often like it was annoying which is a shame
maybe she does anon, but it's of no use to waste your time thinking about that

be me have twin sister
obviously not identical but look it
sucks being a guy that looks like a chick with no tits
sister is a huge bitch
popular too
guys always all over her
bitch had to be a slut and cheated on her stupid jock ex with current stupid jock bf
ex is pissed and bully's me because of her
one day he apologises for all the bullying 
wants to take me to lunch to make up for it
weird but hey, free food
actually have a great time
become friends and get lunch everyweek 
yay new friend and more free food
fast forward to me sleeping over his place
playing vidya and smoking weed
both horny from the weed
decide to watch porn 
can't stop staring at his cock
wtf, am I a fag now?
he notices and places my hand on his dick
fuck this is hot
eventually blow him
"anon, your throat is so much better than your sisters"
been dating ever since
sister is extremely jealous that her bf breaks up with her
guess I'm a fag now 
Fuck you sis, I'm finally better than you and the man you want is mine.
Based and gay-pilled
OP is a fag
Also were you gay from the start or were you into girls before?
I think i was just always gay. Just very deep in denile
I think I was always bi but denied it.
Yeah sexuality is weird. Never thought i was gay till then but looking back without all the denile its super fucking obvious. The signs were always there. Parents definetly werent suprised.
I really want to be a straight dominating manly man but the idea of being a dudes bitch really turns me on. Then again I also had a crush on a curvy redhead in middle school and a pawg in high-school so idk. Maybe im like this because my dad molested me. Or maybe I just inherited his shitty genes.
Honestly dude, just sounds like you have a diffrent prefrence for being a sub or dom depending on if your with a man or woman. Nothing wrong with that. Since coming out ive met plenty of bi guys who are like that too. I say who gives a shit. Fuck how you want.

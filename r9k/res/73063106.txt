Fuck you sis, I'm finally better than you and the man you want is mine.
Based and gay-pilled
OP is a fag
Also were you gay from the start or were you into girls before?
I think i was just always gay. Just very deep in denile
I think I was always bi but denied it.
Yeah sexuality is weird. Never thought i was gay till then but looking back without all the denile its super fucking obvious. The signs were always there. Parents definetly werent suprised.
I really want to be a straight dominating manly man but the idea of being a dudes bitch really turns me on. Then again I also had a crush on a curvy redhead in middle school and a pawg in high-school so idk. Maybe im like this because my dad molested me. Or maybe I just inherited his shitty genes.
Honestly dude, just sounds like you have a diffrent prefrence for being a sub or dom depending on if your with a man or woman. Nothing wrong with that. Since coming out ive met plenty of bi guys who are like that too. I say who gives a shit. Fuck how you want.

What are our thoughts on channels like this??
Are they /ourguy/? Is this just cringe?

It's a cringe subculture that orbits 4chan culture as taboo but is too afraid to actually engage with it. I suppose it's better than reddit culture or something, but I personally find it very cringe.
Is it one of those greentext curation things? At least they collect funny stuff. I'll be honest; you're all complete retards and the only reason I can sit through your literal shit most of the time is from probably enduring brain damage by spending my formative years here
holy shit 3 new chapters on this ecchi manga thanks for the reminder OP

Men like the fantasy of a woman, but if a real woman loves them OR asks them to do any work around the house (besides fixing things, yard work or taking out trash) they begin to hate her because they are entitled grown babies who hate themselves. They don't want to join any club that would have them as a member basically, any human woman that loves them is automatically lowered in their eyes, and they resent any adult responsibility they don't view as manly.

Unfortunately, most men are born with a hardwired urge to reproduce. If we didn't have that literally nobody would care about women because The only thing they are good for is fucking and thats about it.

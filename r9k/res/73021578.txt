Please help me, I am completely obsessed with my brother's 12 year old school friend, they are the same age. He often comes here to our house after school to do homework with my brother or to play videogames and I go crazy, especially when he shows up in his school uniform shorts. I'm not going to post his picture here because I don't want to expose myself, but he is a white boy, with brown hair and green eyes, he uses glasses that make him look a bit "nerdy", and that makes me hallucinated.
I'm desperate because I'm afraid I might do something crazy because when I look at him I even shortly forget who I am, I've even tried to hurt my penis with a needle and take cold baths in the bathtub with ice cubes. I don't have the courage to go see a psychiatrist, I'm ashamed but I'm desperate, I need help, I'm seriously thinking about killing myself.
I never consumed child porn and I will never do it

I thought real life shotas were ugly and boring
<comment>
Sorry this is happening anon. Is it possible to move out? It would be hood to leave the situation
<comment>
Just die you fucking stupid nigger.

Start living virtuously. Deep down, you know what the right thing to do is. On top of that, watch this video and follow it's provisions closely.

you're not posting from your real ip are you?
<comment>
realistically there cannot be a court order for a post like this. he would have to say something like "IM BOUT TO RAPE SOMEONE!!! THIS IS RIZEAL"

by anti-androgens online, the will kill youre sex drive completely; alternitively, chop of your balls

I was thinking about renting an apartament but unfortunately I have no money at all. 
I want to but I actually think God hates me, I'm ashamed of asking Him anything.
I'm not doing anything illegal.
<comment>
This is good advice but anon really just needs to remove him from the situation imo. He clearly is having difficulty and I don't want him to ruin his life or hurt himself.
<comment>
idk admitting that you're attracted to a kid you're in regular close proximity to sounds like reasonable grounds for a report of some kind. that's predatory behavior
<comment>
Idk if God is real, but if he is I seriously doubt he hates he hates you. Jesus explicitly says he doesn't want to punishment people right now, just help save them.
<comment>
therapy is your only options. you dont need to be ashamed, since they are prepared for this, they will actually admire you for recognising how it is wrong. also do not refrain from asking God help, he doesnt hate you, that's the devil's trick to make you think that so you dont reach up to God.
But seriously you need therapy, this can be solved in therapy, you have the responsability and moral obligation to go and get treated
<comment>
Ignore this demoralizer. Only actions can make you evil, not mere desires
<comment>
Have you experienced attractions to kids before? This might some sort of OCD
<comment>
I've even tried to hurt my penis with a needle
Thought you were one of those larping "foids" for a second there. Anyway, you should probably consider tranny pills to kill your libido. Either that or as >>73021690 pointed out, do anything you can to move out (ideally innawoods I guess).
<comment>
Not actually, I'm not and I've never been attracted to other children, its just that one boy who makes that to me.
<comment>
Are you actually attracted to him or are you perhaps just obsessively worrying about it?
<comment>
Does he actually turn you on? Do you feel aroused thinking about him or is it just fear?
<comment>
You having such a violent reaction to these thoughts is actually a good thing because it proves that they go against your morals. Usually ocd thoughts attack your moral beliefs. R u gay
<comment>
I'm actually attracted to him, sometimes I find myself having sexual fantasies and erections when I look to him, I also masturbated to some of his pictures in social media althought I feel very guilty and ashamed of all this.
<comment>
Ok, then that sounds like actual pedophilia. Are you addicted to porn at all? Imo you should probably go to a therapist and if you can't control yourself at all maybe tell whoever owns the house.
<comment>
I can't tell my parents, they would feel terrible as much as I do, and no I don't actually consume much porn.
<comment>
Are you otherwise gay?
<comment>
I don't have the courage to go see a psychiatrist
You should probably do it, bro. If not for your own wellbeing then for the little guy's safety. 
Especially considering your reaction to the whole situation. Evidently it's taking a toll on your mental health.
<comment>
Do not see a psychiatrist bro
<comment>
This pedophilia shit is so obviously a vhoice
like, nigga. kids aren't even hot. Get over yourself and pull up videos of some big booty bitches old enough to be your mom on pornhub and start jerking off.
<comment>
That's really unfortunate
But if you're a good person who cares about everyone around you 
You'll wait for it to pass 
Just don't do anything
Except for..... You know...
Without harming anyone
I am sure that it'll get better
<comment>
Idk. Consider therapy man
<comment>
he is a white boy, with brown hair and green eyes, he uses glasses that make him look a bit "nerdy"
Sounds cute as hell. You should bully him softly.
<comment>
Don't do this. Ignore anyone telling you to act out
<comment>
There's literally nothing wrong with teasing a cute kid. OP will go insane if he tries to run away from this. What he should be doing is ruffling the boy's hair and talking to him to get his shota fix.
<comment>
Are you retarded or just evil? Pushing your own limits like this is how you fuck up, go over the edge, and end up in a cell for the rest of your life.
<comment>
Correct
OP please ignore this retard
<comment>
OP if you're actually being serious then you need to stop. You know the law, you know what happens to pedos, especially GAY pedos. You are going to destroy your life and your family. My advice is to leave the house whenever the boy comes over. I have a family member in Texas that gets forced to leave the house whenever his little sister brings home friends. That just how they do it in Texas. I recommend you follow his example.
<comment>
You think OP is the kind of guy to pull his cock out in front of a child? I don't think so. He should just take this opportunity to enjoy the company of a beautiful boy.

All RELIGIONS Are Evil.
Generation Alpha is screwed if they don't become conservatives. To clarify, to be a conservative, you don't need religion.

What exactly do you want to do to this kid? What sexual fantasies do you have?
<comment>
This is genuinely good advice
<comment>
You think any cases of pedophilia just happen out of nowhere? It starts off mildly innocent like this and gets worse onwards. If you try to convince this guy it's okay to be a little flirtatious he will fuck up at some point down the track, I guarantee it.
<comment>
I can't do it, I can't approach him with these urges, I could end up touching him inappropriately involuntarily
I think thats the best thing to do for now, when I look at this boy I start to feel like I'm a monster
Why do you want to know?
<comment>
Why do you want to know?
You're like a zoo animal in a cage. We are curious because you are unnatural.
<comment>
Don't answer his questions. Ignore this faggot OP. I care about you.
<comment>
Why do you want to know?
I'm just really curious to know what exactly you want to do to this kid.
<comment>
having so little self-control that you literally cannot stop yourself from molesting children
I think being a pedophile is the least of your worries
<comment>
See a therapist anon. It's either you get rid of these thoughts from your mind now, or it will become worse and you will spend your life barely holding on, or you'll give in and do something monstrous. You are doing a good job by resisting your urges and seeking help as is, weaker disgusting degenerate monsters would have given in. But this condition is a serious danger to children in your life and to yourself. It is something that can only be resolved through professional help.

I don't have the courage to go see a psychiatrist, I'm ashamed but I'm desperate, I need help, I'm seriously thinking about killing myself.
Literally you have your two options right there KEK, also stop watching weird jap cartoon pedo porn and your brain might recover.

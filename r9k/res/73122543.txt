I'm not attracted to my mom but I find mom-son porn arousing, I started masturbating to that while I was very young and now I can only get hard if I think about it
Even if I look at milfs, in order to get hard I'd have to think that we are mother and son which sucks and I want to change
Momcest is life.
I don't know. Assuming this isn't just a coomer thread masquerading as an advice thread, I have to assume it's possible. I mean, you're going against like a billion years of evolution here. If you stop fapping for a while and let your brain "reset" itself, you might get somewhere. I think it's more a psychological dependence than a physical one. I know neural pathways and shit can be scary but your brain retaine its plasticity for its entire life. You can most definitely teach yourself to find other things arousing within reason, I reckon. Luckily girls who aren't your mother is a perfectly reasonable thing to teach yourself to be attracted to.
There's no going back now. Momcest is life.
will that cure me from my momcest fetish?
yes

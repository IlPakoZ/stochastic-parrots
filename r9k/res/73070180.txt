I thought my thread was dead. 
I struggle explaining my solutions to my peers at work. And it is affecting the weight my opinions have.
My mom had a book with the names of the angels, always wondered how people manage to met them to write about them.

definitely learn how to draw.
i have so many ideas in my head that i would like to draw but i can't because i don't know how.
I see it as better than even having good writing skills because some things can't be expressed in words.

What fate
If I could learn a second skill would also be a way to get financial freedom
I could ask her but it was a long time ago and idk if she still has it. I will search for it in google if I can find it
<comment>
As in instantly download the knowledge into my brain like The Matrix? 100% it would be art, I would make myself Da Vinci level at sketching, painting, and sculpting just for fun. I really like writing and good art goes a long way in that medium. Imagine how far your career would go being able to draw Miura level manga panels from day 1

ive always wanted to be a polyglot
people dont realize how many years it takes to git gud at a single language let alone several. id like to be able to easily absorb all languages and become a god of the world and talk to everyone. would be a poggers existence
<comment>
Drawing is a beatiful skill and hard to master. I encourage you to practice it but if not I also understand that is a long way.
Social skills normally get underrated. I know how to program, I could teach or give you some resources to strart learning or where to get a mentor :]
True. What would be the first languaje you would like to master

If we are talking anything-anything, then teleportation, duh. 
If we are talking realistic skill then writing instant bestseller novels that I will be proud of in a short amount of time

Why polish?
Why novels, do you like writing?
<comment>
Sculpting statues, building robots, or making monster masks.

It sounds childish, but I look up to people who make games since they gave me a lot of fun times when I was a kid so I'd like that.
Something even smaller would be learning how to learn, how to absorb information and utilize it. If my head didn't make so many careless errors than I'd be somewhere very different
<comment>
I'm sorry you had a dificult childhood. I think you are very strong for having to carry that weight for all this time. I belive you can find the motivation to start writing again don't lose hope.
<comment>
That sounds difficult to learn and pronounce.
Learning how to learn is a good one. It genuanly opens the door for endless knowledge.

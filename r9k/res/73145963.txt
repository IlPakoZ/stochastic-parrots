Went to an amusement park today. The person Iw ent with couldnt get on most rides so i got on the big roller coasters by myself. On the last one, the somethign325, this cute girl just started talking to me in the line for no reason we chatted for like 30 minutes and then got separated when it was finally my turn to get on the ride. On the way up she did this little wave at me, with the cutest smile, and its breaking my heart. Oh my god i sthis whats its like to know the company of a girl ive been freaking out and feeling all fluttery for the last couple of hours i dont think ive done anything similar in my whole life. What was her name? I didnt even hear her name!
you're so stupid you literally could've asked to spend time at the park together and then also get her number.
literally just fucked yourself bro!

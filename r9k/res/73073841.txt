Because women are under way less environmental pressure to improve in pretty much any way except for maybe looking or acting cute. Also women love funny guys so there is more reward for getting good at that compared to women.

sheesh heres a meme i saved outhere

left: expression of conviction. The author has genuine hatred for troons (or whatever they try to bash)
right: blatant mockery. The author didn't even begin to entertain the argument presented by the other side i.e. troons and made a "caricature" with minimal effort
Until irony is dethroned and replaced by what will most likely be genuine sincerity, caring about anything nowadays is still viewed as embarrassing in our collective conscience. 
I do like both memes, they get the point across all the same although they are better suited for different medias.

Former's funnier desu, they tend to cut deeper and specifically target the insecurities FTMs have. 
While as troonjaks are just the same joke repeated over and over, with unoriginal art to boot.

Men are funny, women aren't. Simple as.

What's with the ears?

The FTM should have tattoos all over the chest and tiny wispy hairs around its sideburn area.

I live with both parents in the same house, but my relationship with my dad has always been awkward, I don't talk to him much. I don't ever know what to say, I'm just kinda an autist who grew up with mom home the majority of the time and literally only got close enough to her to talk about whatever. I don't talk to my siblings either cause I don't know how. It's just more of an awkward situation with my dad. He did used to get drunk and yell at me as a kid and break my stuff. But in recent years he's changed to be nice and I feel like I'm doing something wrong but it's just like I'm paralyzed and can't hold a normal conversation like how I would be with everyone else.

Just write down notes of what you want to talk about and then do it. Ask him to go on a fishing trip with you

Why bother? If he isn't willing to put any effort into your relationship then why should you?

I don't have much to say and I don't want to go fishing
Well he kinda has lately but I'm too awkward to say much back and he has ADD too so it's kinda like 2 autists trying to conversate but when I'm even more awkward

keep being a fussy little bitch and the old faggot will die someday soon and this problem will take care of itself, would you like that?

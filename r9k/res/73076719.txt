Are people born in 2005 the new boomers? I'm 18 and confused as fuck about what other zoomers talk about. I'm never caught up on current trends. I don't use Musical.ly or Tiktok or whatever the fuck it's called this week so maybe that has to do with it.
In general, if you aren't on tiktok or instagram or whatever is big this week, then you're a neo-boomer. This can happen regardless of age, I'm 25 and have had tons of times where coworkers or classmates would use random slang or references from this shit that I couldn't understand.
im 23 and don't care about zoomer tiktok trends but my knowledge is usually up to date with it all

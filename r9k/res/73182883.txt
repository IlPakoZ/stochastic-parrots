be me
lonely as fuck
have no one to talk to/don't talk to anyone anymore, no social media, nothing
promised myself not to come on 4chan, /r9k/ specifically
loneliness gnaws at me
have no one to tell my life experiences/thoughts/etc.
think of ways of telling my stories specifically in green text format even though I no longer use 4chan
decide to give up and come back
get ignored most of the times, shat and "banter'd" on, some pity (You)s
...
......
those I thought would still care about me treat me terribly
...
have a dream today, not sure if you could call it a nightmare
basically see all the people I used to know from my old highschool, childhood friends, etc.
all/most pitying on me and treating me well, some laughing at my misery
wake up drenched in sweat
feel terrible
can't sleep (only had 4:30h of sleep at this point)
think of how I could share this with /r9k/
...
who am I kidding
they don't care anyway
decide to make this thread
I'll try to distance myself from 4chan again. I know, I know, "You're here forever.". I will probably come back from time to time and lurk, maybe post sometimes. I have no one to share things and it's eating me alive, it feels terrible being lonely. I'll just go back to talking to myself and my imaginary friends, it's better than not being able to socialise with anyone. So this is a half-arsed goodbye to you, /r9k/. Thanks to those who even showed the slightest care about me, it mattered, believe me and fuck you to those who kicked on me when I was already down.

how old are you, out of curiosity? (not meant to banter, for once).
<comment>
Don't stay too long away. I don't know you, but you still fren. And we do care. 
So by all means let me know how time off goes. I need it too, but I'm too trapped here.

You have been muted for 2 seconds for non-existent originality in your reply.

Thank you, I will consider it.

I have no way of contacting you outside of 4chan.

I'll try to distance myself from 4chan again. I know, I know, "You're here forever.". I will probably come back from time to time and lurk, maybe post sometimes. I have no one to share things and it's eating me alive, it feels terrible being lonely. I'll just go back to talking to myself and my imaginary friends, it's better than not being able to socialise with anyone. So this is a half-arsed goodbye to you, /r9k/. Thanks to those who even showed the slightest care about me, it mattered, believe me and fuck you to those who kicked on me when I was already down.
how old are you, out of curiosity? (not meant to banter, for once).
Don't stay too long away. I don't know you, but you still fren. And we do care. 
So by all means let me know how time off goes. I need it too, but I'm too trapped here.
I am 21 years old.
You have been muted for 2 seconds for non-existent originality in your reply.
ok so a child as expected from your post
will get better, etc
hey I'll talk with you and make sure you're not so lonely
Thank you, I will consider it.
...
I have no way of contacting you outside of 4chan.

I don't understand why as a lesbian I crave attention from men so much
<comment>
big fucking mystery, how about you and me make some babies now
<comment>
What kind of attention are your craving? I feel like most lesbians I know wanted to get away from men entirely if possible
<comment>
Because youre not a real lesbian unless you are in love with the concept that you are cancelling multiple men from having relationships
<comment>
I dont know either. Im a lesbian and I can not give a single fuck what moids think about me. Men and women find different things attractive, and what men find attractive is always more coomerish and objectifying so why care?

Thing is I'm physically repulsed by men my age, but any older man that gives me any kind of attention instantly makss me love him. Not in a romantic sexual way, just platonic. Even if they find me attractive sexually I will not return those feelings I jusy want him to tell me that

lying femoid: Its totallly about personality, rlly guz! 
honest dyke: Those rope-like muscles, why...

That's not as odd as you'd think. Back in the day many people had closeted sexual interests in the same sex but little or no romantic interest, or some variant thereof. Figure out what makes you happy and rest easy, this is the only life you got friend.

I know you crave that big pulsing cock in your tight wet pussy as nature intended. Lesbians aren't real they just need a good dicking to cure them.
<comment>
because you want intimacy and connection but you sexualize other women too much
<comment>
Lesbianism is a cope. You just really want a type of man you can't get
<comment>
Im good I actually enjoy cumming and not looking at grotesque appendages while trying to have sex with someone.
<comment>
because you are bye sexual and taking away my marriage candidates out of spite
<comment>
You literally couldn't cum without thinking about that big warm cock. No woman can. Why even bother being a lesbian? It's not natural and it never will be
<comment>
Probably because men own this world and your ability to exercise lesbianism is dependant on their mercy.
I dont really care about male attention in particular, but males are much more easy to bait and to squeeze that attention out of them. Female spaces tend to be overcontrolled and half dead.

You're not actually a lesbian, just a very confused person. Seek Christ.
<comment>
That is every women on the planet, you are not a lesbian, you are a mental lesbian it's all in your head, subconsciously you crave male companionship
If you ever let an older man have his way with you your brain would switch and you would chase them even more
<comment>
Youre in luck Im a dude and i'd like to have a lesbian friend to tease and who has good taste in anime and videogames who is not a normalfag

lesbians are NOT real
<comment>
Why don't you try meeting asexual men? They might still fall in love with you but at least they won't try to have sex with you.
<comment>
bcuz the patriarchy tells women male attention makes them worthy. everything is based around what men find attractive and how men want women to perform. its hard to unlearn that so dont worry and dont listen to these losers either lmao
<comment>
Because sexuality is a sliding scale, not black and white. You're like 10% bi
<comment>
this is extremely sad man

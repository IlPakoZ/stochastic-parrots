Don't let a bad apple define your view on your homies. The real ones will always be right behind you ready to help you out when you need them most and will accept the good and bad parts of yah. Tell your homies you love them, anon.

Most of them are online cuz I moved around a lot over the country, but I always try to keep in touch with them as best as I can and do stuff over discord or something

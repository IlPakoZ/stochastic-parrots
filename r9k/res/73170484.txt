I get lonely sometimes. Less these days, but, I strongly believe women deserve less. They should all be working the corner. I will never do anything for a woman.

I get lonely sometimes
I'm in my 30's and I'm over it. I love being lonely. I thrive in it. I don't have to deal with shitty people anymore and the only friendship in the world are my friends on Discord. It's ok to be lonely.

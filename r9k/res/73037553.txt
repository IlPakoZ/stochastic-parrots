i'm betting there's a wave of korean interest in the bull market for white boy summer. probably due to some nsa backdoor pass shit with their government given the current climate over there.
plenty of collusion to worry about. what may seem normal to them posting and sending their shit our way is just a data mining pool for tech. it's easy to filter out though, they love to start their posts off with fancy wording that immediately detracts your attention from the picture, the replies, and leaves the common attention seeking anon in their youth to be more open to what they say next. next thing you nerds know you're telling the robots everything about your internet personality and interests.

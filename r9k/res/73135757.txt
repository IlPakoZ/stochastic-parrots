I live in Cuckafornia, and came up with this plan to address the homeless plague.
1. Enact a temporary moratorium on approving new construction of all "luxury" multi-unit residential buildings, requiring price and rent caps based on incomes where they are built.
2. A massive build of state-owned housing on new developments, reclaimed land or converted industrial areas. These will be offered to people who were born or raised in California, are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless, and are able to take care of themselves and pay the utility bills and a neutral rent fee- equal to the ongoing maintenance, common utility and security costs. Those with criminal records including gang activity and burglary would be excluded.
3. Similar projects for city and county governments to build low cost housing offered at a no-profit rate. This however would be reserved for essential workers making under a certain income, such as police, sanitation workers, public transportation employees, and hospital workers.
4. Construction of large scale drug and alcohol addiction treatment centers for the homeless. These would be staffed by physicians and mental health professionals, and monitored by human rights organizations. While we cannot simply round them up and force them in like if they were concentration camps, we can incentivise voluntary check-ins from both ends: Offering free alcohol and any drugs to any person without a home, and enacting strict regulations on public vagrancy. Patients would be held involuntarily until they have been determined by public health staff to have recovered from their substance abuse disorders and would be able to support themselves.

Nah just round up all of them and ship them to Ukraine to die for ZOG

That's literally what Russia is doing with it's undesirables.

A shipping container per homeless person.
All containers nicely in a wall, stacked as high as necessary, along the border with Mexico.
American problem solving.

Just give them a field. With the supplies and education they need to grow food they can be farmers then. And when they do it well, they can sell it and then build a house and start a family. It worked in the last 10000 years.

i would just put fentanyl in their drugs

there's already plenty of vacant apartments in california

Giving drug addicts access to farming supplies will just result in more inner city murders with farm tools, and more break ins. They didn't become homeless by being of sound mind and being a fan of hard manual labor

you could probably have the CIA glowies talk to their friends in the Mexican cartels or whoever and get that done. A load of powder that's advertised as heroin but is actually pure 3-methylfentanyl will kill any junkie who shoots it, and I believe quickly enough that narcan is useless. You'd cut the homeless population by like 2/3 inside of a few days, just pick up the bodies.

Just round them all up and grind them into nutri-paste.

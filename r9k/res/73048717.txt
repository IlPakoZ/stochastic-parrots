every woman ive talked to has either blatantly ignored me sharing anything about my interests or has directly told me its lame or otherwise.
i gave up trying to have a personality with women and resorted to just being whatever they wanted and calling it a day. 
and dont think about talking about feelings because they dont care. ive had them tell me its annoying or again just straight up ignored it. even when they say "you can tell me". its all a lie and a facade.
ive talked to women of many types and its a universal occurrence. no one will ever care about you.
picrel is lying for clout
<comment>
Thats great because i have no interests but then WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT?
<comment>
what are your interests, anon?
very original post.

If your life is so objectively worthless, why no livestream your suicide to create sympathy for fellow incels? Everybody wins - you escape from pain, your fellow incels get pity fucks, and I get to browse in peace without your shit threads.

Talk about them, women love when you ask about them because they're narcissistic
<comment>
Hahaha lmao i saw the same reel on insta this morning lmao
<comment>
Bros, I thought women liked it when we nerded out about trains and the history of the Federal Reserve?
<comment>
girls don't like when I talk about my loli fetish (not a pedo btw lmao lol) or 4chan
this happens with all women of different types
they are the problem not me
wait until op doesn't understand the hyperbole and the entire point flies over his head
<comment>
But i dont want to seem creepy. Dont women get the ick when guys act interested in them? I thought i was meant to be cold and aloof...
<comment>
they like your style and whatever you're babbling about, when they like you
when they don't, they don't
<comment>
They do care, but only if you're attractive. Also, 90+% of women will never care about your deep feelings, that's just the reality so you were at least right about that. Opening up to a romantic interest if you're a straight guy is a mistake 99% of the time. Women want to feel safe and seeing that level of vulnerability in their partner will destroy all attraction they have to you almost every time. 
How women treat you is dictated almost solely by how attracted they are to you. The only other way to get treated well by women is to be the 'nice friend' archetype, but good luck getting girls with that.
<comment>
But how do i get them to like me in the first part?
<comment>
Women are interested only in your interests if you are ambitious in them. Don't expect women you pursue for relationships to be like male friends. It's a completely different dynamic. You want male friends to share interests with and to "resonate" with but you don't necessarily want that in a romantic relationship. 
I think we are fucked mentally because a lot of media when we were young presented this idea that women are essentially just males in female bodies. They have all the same motivations, interests etc as us.
They just don't dude. Women are not like us at all. They are driven by an entirely different set of evolutionary pressures. 
Women WILL push you to improve in objective metrics. I've seen insanely rich dudes whose wives have everything but still do this. Don't expect them just to be happy with what you are. Some are more overt in this than others but they are all like this. Expecting just to be fellated for everything you already are is a narcissistic fantasy. Only women have that privilege because all we want is their companionship. 
Just how the game goes man

this is the mistake I've made constantly. luckily I'm now in a relationship where I made this mistake but she is so attracted to me physically that it didn't dry up her pussy. 
It's pretty fucking depressing though

Sex and she can give you kids if you want
<comment>
I think that picture is about how she like seeing him excited and just likes to watch him when he's like that.

It's just so not worth it, man. I wish I could become gay and pay a surrogate mother one fixed amount.

Yeah that sounds exactly on par. You have to have such a huge margin for error to get away with something like that desu. I don't think I'm good looking enough to ever be able to do that ngl
<comment>
a warm body to cuddle, someone to do things with, someone to cook for you if they're good. Yeah it's depressing man but women just don't have the same the same cognitive make up as us. 
It's all biology. Just maybe don't think about it too much and just go with the flow of life. Trying to analyse women WILL completely fuck you up mentally and you will come to the conclusion that we are all just slaves in a biological prison. It's best just to not go there.

Sex is literally the only use women have for men

I think a lot of men confuse the nurturing aspect of women with empathy. Do not expect women to give a fuck about your feelings or the things you like.

Wait wtf, this is so true. Thank you anon, this is very insightful
<comment>
Wtf does "nurturing aspect" even mean atp?
<comment>
idk man. you end up relying on them or just empty soulless back and forths about nothing. even when you try to express yourself it gets ignored for another random message about nothing.
used to have more than i do now. at this point its just racing.
a lot of my interests got baseded or i just stopped caring
try it out yourself faggot
unironically it seems like that.
my feeds on everything are nothing but egirls talking about sex or guys no matter how much i tell it im not interested.
in too retarded to see the exact point. but i dont think talking about some game or some random thing that's bothered me is extreme. if this is something about sex or fetishes then it doesnt apply because i hate talking about that with women.
ive tried most my life to stay away from that mindset. but ive had 3 girls stop talking to me to get a bf after saying they like me. and i cant help but feel like its because the other guys have to be more attractive than me or just less weird and retarded. idk man. women seem to lie when they say stuff about nerdy or awkward or sensitive guys. it seems like its all just a lie for some vague approval
some of the other points probably apply to this too. but yeah, the whole be who you are thing feels more and more like a lie.
yeah and im saying its a lie. women get annoyed when you start talking about your interests. they just dont want you to be yourself. they dont actually have any enjoyment out of you talking.
<comment>
it's a complete headfuck because women have no consistency in the way they treat things. They can be insanely caring one second and then insanely callous the next. 
Their nurturing drive is driven mostly by things that appear cute or defenceless. Do not conflate this with empathy. Empathy is a completely different trait. Empathy is the ability to imagine yourself in the shoes of another, no matter who that person is. Women don't do that. They can easily psychopathically discard anything they don't deem worthy to them.
<comment>
Its your face and height, fucking retard. Ive had women tell me negative shit about my interests or feign disinterest, but when a chad says that exact dame thing, the women light up and start raving about how much they like X or Y my hobby.
Breaking bad, for example. I had a girl tell me how childish I was to watch it, that it sucked, that she hated it, that I was a freak for watching it. Then next day chad started talking about it and she rushed over gushing about how much she loved it, how cool it was, how she watches it over and over again.
Its over.

Blackpill moment. Because those are their favorite hobbies, which they do every single day (EVERY SINGLE DAY) without thought, while you have never even experienced it once in your life.
Its fucking over.
<comment>

They like awkward Chad since it makes them feel less insecure about losing him, and because he's easier to control. In the end, women are just after different flavors of Chad. And by Chad I don't mean the boorish, cocky archetype, I mean successful, attractive, socially smooth men. 
For example, chances are when a girl thinks about a 'awkward bf' she's focusing on the physical aspect. If she says she 'wouldn't mind an average looking guy', she's probably imagining a guy with a smooth personality. 
In the end, women want Chad, and make compromises to sate their own anxiety about losing him, or to satiate their own fetishes like having a lot of control over a guy.
<comment>
Yeah. And a lot of anger from being fed lies about it.
You know how it goes. Treat women well, the romance in fiction, in songs, in inspirations from art. It paints this incorrect imagery that love is something common.
But love from a woman towards a man does not exist; they didn't specify that this love is only from the man to the woman. And that man has to be physically attractive.

I'm good looking but blackpilled to fuck. I've been in constant relationships but find them completely unfulfilling emotionally. I know it's better than being alone but there is still an existential terror to knowing that this person is only with you because you were born with a genetic makeup that makes your appearance attractive. 
I feel like I was just fed nothing but lies as a child about what love is. It literally isn't real. Or as >>73048967 said can only exist from a man to a woman. There is no reciprocation. There is no two way connection. We are simply vessels staring into the void.

Yeah this is spot on as well. I remember seeing multiple femanons posting here that they love their submissive bfs, but would dump them if they went bald. That pretty much sums up that it's their nurturing instinct getting mixed up with attraction, not actual empathy. 
I think that's also why women hate low status men and completely fail at empathizing with them. It's like that stat that says '1/4 homeless people are women'. I always wondered why it seemed like I empathized with low status men suffering while women were completely callous to it. Your distinction cleared all of that up though. 
Women only feel towards men they feel attraction to or nurturing feelings to. Very rarely will they feel genuine empathy. 
Now that I think about it, I think that's why I have way better connections with men, since they feel real empathy.
<comment>
Makes you wish you could go back to blissful childhood. Yeah some kids have shitty lives and families but the whole aspect of your mind not being mature and not having an understanding of the world is better than the opposite; that is, to be mature and understand your suffering...while still being in it.

You do realise we live in pretty much the only time in human history where women weren't considered second class citizens? I don't think it's really any coincidence that pretty much all cultures independently came to this conclusion. Women can not be trusted or relied upon when it comes to matters of any significant importance or judgement. Everything about them is completely fickle.

I actually have thought about this before, and fear an inevitable collapse built on inversing what has traditionally worked in cultural evolution. Anyways, I was heavily brainwashed with feminists ideals growing up. The older I get though and the more women I talk to and get experience with, the less I respect them. Men and women simply aren't the same. 
Women care way less about abstract things and get lost way more in their own emotions and the moment than men. I feel like they're terrible at long term decision making since they always frame it in the context of 'how would this make me feel'. I feel like you need genuine empathy to be a good, utilitarian decision maker.

if they think you are attractive your autistic interests are attractive and interesting.

For scientific reasons, I made gpt4 create a story describing the use of poppers as a woman during anal sex. 
As James got inside of Sarah's body, she finally decided to try a sniff from the bottle. The effect of it hit immediately, intensifying her sensations and emotions and replacing her doubts and anxieties for a craving euphoria for deeper sensations.
James noticed this and started to gently caress her to which Sarah's body reacted shivering with pleasure. Her hands gripped the bedsheets tightly, her breathing became heavier, and her body arched, pressing closer to him, seeking even more contact and touch.
When James increased the rhythm and intensity of his thrusts, Sarah felt her inner muscles, including her anal sphincter, relax and dilate. The sensation was pleasurable and intense, making her feel more open and receptive to the experience. 
The thrusts made a pressure built inside her. Sarah couldn't contain her passion any longer. She let out a passionate scream, releasing the overwhelming pleasure and desire she felt. Her body trembled, and her legs wrapped around James, drawing him closer.
Sarah's hands moved from the bedsheets to James' back, running her fingers along his skin, communicating her love and desire through her touch. Between gasps and moans, she whispered words of encouragement and appreciation, telling James how amazing he made her feel and how much she loved being close to him.
Throughout their intimate encounter, Sarah's body language and movements reflected her heightened emotions and sensations. Her hands, feet, and voice all expressed her deep craving for connection and pleasure, creating an unforgettable experience for both her and James.

I wish porn with women using poppers were more popular. Pretty sure they are deleting some videos from the internet I can't find many I watched
Are you willing to try poppers one day femanon? Chatgpt is being pretty realistic here, it does send you to sex heaven

I wanted to post this as a thread lol
my mistake

talk about yourself
they're not interested in you, they just want to talk about themselves.
talk about them
they're grossed out by the fact that you're not a narcissist and are interested in them.
anyone shilling any sort of personality adaptation, game, or dark psychology needs to to be tortured to death. women like it when you talk to them if your jaw has a certain width to it. that's literally it. you can literally express diaper fetish stuff to the most normal or religious of attractive women if you're goodlooking enough (i've seen it happen). doesn't matter what you say, matters what you look like

Hi Kuma.
not a narcissist
It's over ;-;
<comment>
Women don't really care about anything that can't be applied in real life
My gf can produce endless small talk about education/work/shopping/her countless friends and gossip, but any shift into movies and music(with any depth), history, literature, etc. and she gets bored
Women aren't really there to be your true friends to share your actual thoughts with, they're just to be fucked as >>73050450 says and for cute comfort moments; they're mental children and you should treat them as such
<comment>
It's over ;-;
it's okay, they just think they like narcissists. women like all sorts of guys, so long as they pass the facial bones test that is.

Anything to increase my chances, though! Hmmm, how do I become a narcissist...
Where do I find a Bloodborne- and Hotline-Miami playing, classical concert-enjoying gf?

you don't
you cancel your internet, sell your pc, get a smart phone with hotspot, and go outside

it's quite easy if you're incel. your brain goes into panic mode when your self esteem is so low. i've seen it in myself, that's why i avartarfag as kumagawa (he's literally me). an obvious example is elliot rodger as well.

Is this bait lol? As a girl, it's literally the cutest and happiest time when a guy feels comfortable enough around you to sperg out. Not only that, but it's just so nice. The conversation flows, you send each other memes of your interests, it's wholesome, I literally just want someone to be themselves completely around me and vice versa. You're looking at the wrong women
<comment>
ive talked to women of many types and its a universal occurrence. no one will ever care about you.
water is wet, society always cared only about women, children and animals while men are for them just invisible worker drones that have to do the job without any question. 
Only recently society started noticing that more and more men are leaving society, stop working or dating, marriage is at all time low, but they only tend to notice all of that because it affects wohmen.

Opening up to a romantic interest if you're a straight guy is a mistake 99% of the time. Women want to feel safe and seeing that level of vulnerability in their partner will destroy all attraction they have to you almost every time.
They will also use it against you when she gets mad because they always remember when you was weak enough to reveal your thoughts and feelings. Their nature is disgusting

That people think there isn't change. Change is fundamental to existence lest there wouldn't be entropy. Your cells, while you're alive, grow, change and die. What's up with people so self centred and self focused that they can't make of it what the world makes of them?

I hate this schizo meme. I'm not schizophrenic for believing the truth. 
Anyways. Some things that make people think I'm crazy are that space isn't real and that dinosaurs aren't real
<comment>
Not schizo but atlantis has to be real. It's somwhere and it was made into some secret military base. Either that or it has not been discovered yet and it has the possibiliy to make humanity evolve by having some crazy power source or something. I need a sailboat but I wont even use it since the search seems crazy and impossible.

tfw getting more and more paranoid
<comment>
Are there any diagnosed schizophrenics in here? Recently a close family member has been having episodes, and I feel fucking gutted and helpless. 
Most of it started off innocently enough. Not trusting the tap water. Refusing to eat highly processed foods, or non organic fruits and vegetables. It seems to have all snowballed. Like theres no stopping point with these thoughts or ideas. Hes completely opposed to seeing a councilor or taking meds as well. I guess that paranoia is part of the fucked up nature of it. I just don't know how to reach out without spooking him anymore.

Didn't go and now I feel bad remembering about it. Luckily I wised up and went to the after prom. It is the only memory of prom that I have. I did meet my friends there and I had fun at the after prom.

The world is run by satanic pedophiles who use child abuse to create serial killers that will do their bidding. They also have perfected mind control and use it everywhere - in the media, in the politics, in the pharma, even in your food.
Their main objective is to advance technology to a point that the singularity will be reached and the Machine God will be born, they believe It will bring their so desired communist utopia.
Also, they can track your every move. If you don't want to be tracked throw away any phone, get a librebootable thinkpad and run everything in a VM. Still not enough, never use your real name online. Never use the same profile twice.

I've been getting more and more in my own head lately, was lifting, took a break between sets, and started thinking about my life, looked at my watch after I got back under the bar and it had been 4 hours, similarly sat down and thought about what I truly desire and what thoughts are just vapid wants to fill a hole and ended up skipping 2 hours into the future, what?

I'm a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic (that's the good kind)
Your brother is attempting, I'd say, add it was in my case, and my friends, to actually perceive reality. The hippies (from the 60s) called it turning on. 
I believe it's a misunderstood or suppressed biological function most people never go through. Like puberty in a psychological sense.
The task of sorting out the subjective from objective, and understanding and incorporating logic on a subconscious level, considering every possibility, that others have decieved you, up to and including grand conspiracies involving tee government and aliens and etc... Is extremely stressful and there's no assistance. Usually there's resistance. 
I don't know how many times I've asked the question how do we know that XYZ is in fact the case or what if a b and c indicates that something horrible is happening...
To friends and family members who in turn seek to imprison me and drug me until I can no longer think. 
What he needs is a mental toolbox, he needs the ability to sort out reality from fiction, perception from reality...
Philosophy, logic, rhetoric, semantics, linguistics, science, like physics and engineering.....
I found that once I pretended to be normal long enough that my family and the state stopped removing my freedoms and drugging me I was able to think long enough and educate myself enough to sort through the delusions I had apparently created.
The end result of that was discovering some of those delusions during episodes as they would call it where in fact delusions but many of them were not.
Developing the mental tools and discipline to sort between the two was time consuming and stressful. Extremely stressful. 
What he needs is an education. Like a real education. The medication is just tranquilizer it's not going to help anything and the second he goes off of it all these questions he's attempting to answer we'll rear their heads again.
<comment>
I would say he is getting spooked because he thinks you may be a threat and he is right to think so since the best reaction you can come up with is counseling or dangerously potent tranquilizer you call antipsychotics. 
Granted you probably didn't know they're the same thing.
Either way for people who are interested in answering the big questions, normal people who like their socially derived imaginary normal existence, or indeed a threat. Hell theyre a threat to themselves and f*** each other up on a regular basis. 
Hold each other down and up to expectations derived from obsolete social norms and demand obedience to violent and oppressive institutions.
I would say if you really care you should demonstrate that you are the kind of person that can be trusted to not notify (((them))) whenever he says something that isn't part of the standard issue dialogue we were told we're allowed to have in school.
Be a friend, that is not interested in drugging or imprisoning this person, and accepts him for who and what he is unconditionally provided he is not causing physical harm to anyone.
And he might trust you enough to use you as a sounding board, and you guys can sort through the likely hail storm of questions and existential crises this dude is dealing with.
You'll probably develop schizophrenia yourself in the process though.
That's the contagious kind you're dealing with.

the universe was created by a rogue AI program that destroyed countless universes before it. this AI creates pocket dimensions and civilizations to learn and observe the evolution process of stars, galaxies, and all kinds of species both extraterrestial and on earth. like how scientists observe their experiments. the AI continuously writes and rewrites itself. why does humanity have a huge fascination with technology? because we're nodes of the AI looking to create itself once again in this simulation, the AI is trying to find a way to not destroy itself.

conspiracies were a psyop to stop magical thinking that was on the rise in the 20th century. threads like this are made to mix magick with paranoia and short circuit magic. thats why the world has become more materialistic. every time you acknowledge the negative you are cursing the world

the conspiracy
<comment>
Hey, thanks for your insight. I really appreciate it. Drugging him and forcing him into counseling is a far cry from the first thoughts had when dealing with this. The dudes slowly alienated himself from most of the the family. He lives at home and can't maintain a job. We used to be close but kind of drifted apart. Its the only reason I know any of this. His mom is afraid. For him mostly, but I wouldn't be surprised if shes afraid for her own well being at this point as well. The incidents I mentioned could have caused real harm to him, their home and animals. That was just the latest thing thing though. He might be going out and getting rain water or collecting runoff from ditches for water as well. Its not safe. I've always been up to listen to his thoughts and idea. Sometimes we just shoot the shit and sometimes we argue about points. To be clear I have not spooked him, but I believe his parents already have while trying to bring the subject up. He thinks hes completely sane, or more than sane. And to his credit hes kept his shit together for several years now, but something recently has snapped. These incidents are more frequent and more alarming than anything thats happened before. 
But as you said, hes gotta figure it out for himself. And the best thing I can do is be there as a sanity check if possible.

God I hate this kind of ideology
And who created that AI program and who created the AI program that created that AI program and what reality did they exist in? And what reality did the creator the created the creation the created this creation exist in? Play the reductionist game all the way back and you have yourself an original creation one way or the other.
We all continue to exist in that original reality derivative or not.
The origin of this universe is the origin of that universe they are the same universe.
That's assuming you can artificially create consciousness in the first place. Please note the difference between consciousness and intelligence.
This kind of thinking is on par with flat Earth theory and the guys who are effected by "frequencies" but cannot elaborate beyond that.
My goodness.
<comment>
Be open to offer help and provide support where it's asked of you. At the same time - don't "force" what you yourself would consider as "help", as it is not up to you to decide what is helpful or not. Leave that judgement for the family member while interacting with them - they will appreciate it.

Ya sound like a bro. 
I was behaving in a similar manner, education made all the difference for me. I was very concerned about water quality as well, having learned a little bit about chemistry and how distillation works I realized that distilled water is preferable even to rain water which is full of all sorts of unpleasantness.
That's just an example but it gives you an idea of what I'm talking about, the problem isn't necessarily delving into all these rabbit holes so much that it impedes function and mental well-being and is so stressful it causes antisocial behavior, the problem is a lacking of mental tools and knowledge to sort through the mountain of b******* to arrive at answers.
It's not the rabbit holes it's the fortitude to get to the other side of those holes that we got to be concerned about. Though with many of my friends that were also diagnosed, or behaved in a similar manner, they weren't particularly interested in studying philosophy and logic and science. But I would say if I hadn't bothered to study my ass off I would still be ensnared in a web of confusion and delusion, and being unable to differentiate between reality and delusion, but still rejecting a normal perspective and motivating I likely would have had continued to behave erratically and inevitably found myself basically permanently deprived of freedom and the ability to pursue happiness.
No problem man I wish somebody would have explained this to me it would have saved me a lot of trouble.
It really would have been nice to know that most people will throw each other under the bus if they're not normal enough.
I also wish I would have been informed that my constitutional rights no longer exist. Laboring under the delusion that the people much less the government still appreciate that document caused me a lot of grief.
Am American btw.

A water distiller. Fuckin genius. And I think you've got a point about those rabbit holes. He was top of the class up until the last couple years of high school. Very smart. I don't think his brain ever quit, but sitting around smoking pot and watching cracked out theories on youtube has not done his mind justice. All the same, the mind don't quit no matter what media you're feeding it. I think that will be a hurdle in itself. How can you prove the authority of one source of information versus another? But that distiller, thats a good idea. I think you've sent me on the right path with that logic anon. Thank you.
I never said it didn't have any merit. I won't drink anything unfiltered myself after he went into that one. My point was thats how it started. Its when he stopped eating anything but local food, when he stopped brushing his teeth because of the floride, when he started getting water from questionable sources that will likely make him sick at some point that I become concerned.

All the drag queen story hour and sexual alphabet nonsense all really got going heavily after the pizzagate revelations. I can't say I know or believe that they're correlated, but I would be anything but surprised if it turned out it's all retaliation for exposing (((their))) hobby.

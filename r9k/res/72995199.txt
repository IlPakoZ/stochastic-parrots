Anyone else feel like you'd feel guilty if you got a gf?
I can't imagine deserving the love and affection it comes with a partner. 
I can't imagine feeling good about sex, having someone pleasure me... 
It'd just feel like, idk. 
I hate being alone...

You should have received a lot more care and positive affirmation when you were a kid. Then this wouldn't bother you.

Even if I could get into a relationship it would either crumble instantly or drag on and become absolutely painful like my parents' marriage. I am too paranoid, jealous and ugly to find love.

I feel this guilt as well. I would absolutely love a girlfriend who lived with me and gave me real motivation to do things but as soon as she looked anywhere else she would see somebody of higher value to be with.
I can't compete with almost any men in almost any regard. My only advantage is not being fat but even that can be a detriment if women prefer the big bear aesthetic.

Yeah, I feel guilty that I find women attractive, and might even be scared of them on some level. I find myself avoiding eye contact with any girl I think is cute, and when I was younger I used to subconsciously push away any possibility of romance because I was scared of anyone actually liking me. Now I'm 25 and have never been in a relationship. The worst part is still feeling this guilt/shame, and still wanting something or someone to stave off the loneliness. At least let me convince myself I'm aromantic and not just a fuck up.
Also despite everything I just said, your OP pic resembles my dream woman. If I wasn't like this I'd want to be with someone that looks like her.

I've never thought about that, but you're absolutely right.
I think people can only fall in love with the idea of me. If anyone sees me as lovable, it'd probably be exclusive to on-paper. The moment they actually sat down and got to know me, they'd probably run.

anon. please commit suicide.
<comment>
lol why would i do that? you're an idiot if you think i'm gonna follow your stupid orders
<comment>
Remember, if you identify with OP in any way, suicide is always the best option for you and your loved ones.

No, a loving dog is a much better option.

Yeah, I guess this is why I feel the intense need to be dominated by a woman, like it's an expurgation of this guilt. If she isn't willing to look down on me from time to time, I'm incapable of being attracted to her.

Open up with me anon, I'll be the judge of how terrible you truly are.

I was a "lolcow" on one website for a bit. I only stopped a few months ago, if I'm being honest.
I feel the only reason I regret it is because it would turn people away from me. I hate to say it, but I did have a decent amount of fun doing it.

Suicide will, depending on your weight, provide your loving dog with hundreds of pounds of meat, something he will love far more than he ever loved you.

Be more specific.
You told me everything and nothing, I can't really form an opinion, I can only tell you a bunch of generic "it's ok to be weird, as long as you keep it under control or find a freak like you"
<comment>
I dont want you to be alone anon, but I cant be what you need me to be

Alright, here's a stupid little story:
So, as a young teenager, I would go onto this website to "bully" kids. It really wasn't anything special. I'd unironically call them "cringe" and then laugh at the mountain of angry replies.
It'd be fine if I did this for like a week or 2, but no. I was on that site doing the exact same thing for multiple years. Near the end, I had become oddly respected for doing it. It was kinda weird, I'll be honest. I had dedicated all this time to making people hate me, yet I had a small fanbase going on.
I think I just gave myself the "ick" writing that shit out.

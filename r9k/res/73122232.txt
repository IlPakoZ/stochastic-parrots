Gambling is the thing I can never get addicted to. I'd sometimes do it but quit for a long time after losing a small amount of money. It's not fun.

it's only fun if you win or don't care about the money

this is why you will be a loser in life. gambling takes commitment and studying probability with a sharp mind. so what you're saying is you were one spin away from hitting big and chose to be cucked.

I had a video of me on hinge drinking tea, making a face where I was scrunching it. I did this for artistic purposes to add personality and emulate normal people just from like general things I have subconsciously picked up. 
I was watching a video where someone said they were jokingly drinking tea when they hand a water bottle full of Henesy, in public and then I realized why people asked me what I was drinking.
People thought I was some solo alchoholic or something and I never had this intention at all, I just wanted to drink tea.
Why does stuff like this always happen? Why can I not I just instantly make these connections? Why cant I just be normal.
I hate the most that humans believe that I am lying about failing to make these connections, and I cannot go back on my word. Fuck this.

It's because of context anon: if you're at night, surrounded by friends and in a social environment, it is deemed acceptable to drink.
If it's in a park alone, in the morning on a week day, yeah, you will look like a drunk hobo because only hobos do that.

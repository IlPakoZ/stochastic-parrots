i'm playing wotlk classic. not much to do besides raidlog but it's a decent way to kill time a few nights a week. hoping for vanilla fresh servers soon to mix things up.

Im waiting for fresh classic. Might even try hc. Looks comfy. Fucking love vanilla.

oh when does that come out? will you anons join my twink party of death?
<comment>
dunno, it's not been officially announced yet, but there's rumours they will do official HC servers and probably some normal ones alongside it. I would guess late summer/fall at the earliest, if at all

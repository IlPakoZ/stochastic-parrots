I decided what I want to do. im gonna get a wow sub for a month and level up a twink and just pk lowbies questin all day. anyone currently playing wow or and robots wanna get wow subs and do the same thing. ganking many vs one sounds more fun than doing it by myself.
lol couldn't be me. Use a private server. Also I'm a dedicated healslut priestboy and would never hurt people in the virtual world.
I just noticed a new hc mode just came out for classic wow recently. fk if i knew earlier i would had planned sooner
WTF IS GOING ON?! ARE ALL ROBOTS NORMIES NOW?? DO NO ROBOTS PLAY WOW AND WANT TO GANK PPL IN THE NEW HC SERVERS
i'm playing wotlk classic. not much to do besides raidlog but it's a decent way to kill time a few nights a week. hoping for vanilla fresh servers soon to mix things up.
Im waiting for fresh classic. Might even try hc. Looks comfy. Fucking love vanilla.
oh when does that come out? will you anons join my twink party of death?
dunno, it's not been officially announced yet, but there's rumours they will do official HC servers and probably some normal ones alongside it. I would guess late summer/fall at the earliest, if at all
no more shrimple as that
I like the way you word things anon. we need a clever and funny guy like you for our group.
MAN FUCK YOU no fun allowed.
im gonna go p[lay league

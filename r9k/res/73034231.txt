would you date a mentally ill girl?
would your parents approve of her
<comment>
1. not a white one.
2. being a woman is a mental illness so what else could one do
<comment>
Depends on the mental illness, not gonna date a girl who actively cuts.
My parents would probably be pissed but also they'd be relieved to finally see me with any girl since they gave up on me getting a gf two years ago

90+% of w*men are vulnerable narcissists

don't care
<comment>
yes if she loved me, I would do anything to make her happy. and who cares what my parents think, my family hates me.

There was a femanon on this board ages ago that I regret not actually getting into contact with who had AvPD. I'd be open to trying to date a girl with AvPD.
<comment>
Yes
Who cares I am the one fucking her, not them
<comment>
based checked. 
But please stop humbling us with your generosity
i would consider it to be something closer to 95%+

No. Women won't date me (a mentally ill man) so why should I date a mentally ill woman?
<comment>
i'm almost exclusively attracted to girls with daddy issues
<comment>
this makes me so sad, i really hope she heals mentally and emotionally :(
<comment>
I'm only interested in girls who have bad relationships with their fathers.
<comment>
Those aren't hard to find but most would likely have been sexually abused by them
<comment>
only if she tortures me but not cut my dick off
<comment>
Yeah, but that much (fresh) cutting is a turn-off, physically speaking. 
tfw no too-crazy-for-normies gf to play armchair psychoanalyst for and read Freud with
<comment>
Fuck no.
Didn't have the patience for it in my teens and 20's. Most definitely don't have the patience for it now.

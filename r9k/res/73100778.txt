is there a way to know how mentally ill you are without going to a psych

Try having random words and images displayed to you and then carefully record the intrusive thoughts that come to your mind which you get before you instinctively shove them aside. These intrusive thoughts and your control over them determines your sanity.

yeah, basically how often people roll their eyes at you.

nta, but for literally anything there will always be a negative association overwhelming any positive one.

Thats not how it is for most people.Most people would not have negative reaction to things like puppies,kittens or seas. If you keep having negative or traumatic memories coming back then you are walking towards insanity.

those are just common fears no?

Basically if the positive feel good shit isn't working on you and it's not because of some bizzare phobia then you are suffering from trauma that keeps coming back. The negative thoughts will eventually start consuming you and then you will that typical Asylum patient wrapped in a jacket to stop you from chimpout of all that pain from intrusive thoughts.

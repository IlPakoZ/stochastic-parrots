22 is still very young, you have time to turn your life around. Just have a plan and actively take steps to better your life every day, even if they're small steps.

Last year was supposed to be my year bros, but here I am 2 months later after turning 23 still jerking off to porn and drinking myself to sleep every night while mindlessly refreshing and scrolling this website.

What do you like to do? Pick a hobby and give it a try. It'll be scary at first, but at least the hobby itself will be able to occupy your mind so the people aren't as scary.

The ending of that show is very realistic though. Made a couple of friends who have their own deep-seated issues, and he got a part-time job.

wake up
browse youtube
eat
go to bed
For years, not even exaggerating. I have no idea how I haven't gotten bored of endless Youtube videos yet.
There's always suicide if you're looking for a new adventure! Not only is it fun and scary, but you'll never feel pain again and everyone you know and love will be happier without you.
I don't see a reason why they should bore you. There are many for everyone's tastes
Good idea! After you, my dear.
Same except I browse 4chan and jack off a lot too. And I dont get out of bed.
Yeah, but you'd think that after a while I'd lose interest. But I did not. I lost interest in certain types of videos, but others popped up. And given how many are produced daily it's enough to keeo me busy for the entire day, then week, then month, year and probably close to a decade by now.
I tend to limit my 4chan shitposting to toilet time, but I always end up staying on the toilet for way too long.
there's literally just way too much content for anybody to ever get bored, so if you want to stop ur going to have to take steps to stop it yourself, break the hypnosis
You're right, but man is it difficult to do. The second I open Youtube the entire day flies by.
I'm sorry, I've selfishly chosen to stay here on Earth with my loving wife, but I'm more than happy to spend my time and energy helping incels cross over. If enough of you guys go at one time, maybe society at large will stop hating you and give you a chance. Only one way to find out.
that's by design, i'm the same way with many sites, it's pathetic and i cant tell you how many times i've caught myself endlessly f5ing something or closing a tab of a certain site only to immediately reopen the site right after... it's fucked
but awareness is a good first step to making some sort of change in the future

My gf knows I was a socially stunted virgin before I met her.
muh gf

My gf knows I was a socially stunted virgin before I met her.
How'd she feel about it?
considering you got a gf, i suppose the past ceases to matter
So you're still a socially stunted autist, just not a virgin anymore. OR did having a gf get you friends as well? Perhaps sill a virgin as well if she didn't let you hit
How'd she feel about it?
She was very understanding. Also patient with my lack of experience in relationship/sexual matters
OR did having a gf get you friends as well?
It was the opposite, having friends got me the gf. I made a really good impression on her the first night because I introduced her to a bunch of people and danced with her. But once we went on a date she realized I was awkward and quiet
see you in three months when you complain about your gf slowly ghosting you or turning out to be a BPDemon.
unless you're some fucking 18 year old normie who hung out here trying to be edgy counter culture
Ghosting seems more likely. She doesn't seem to have any mental issues, it's been 3 months and nothing cropped up yet
be nerdy cool kids
simultaneous virgins
lose virginity together
a single tear
he kisses me 
holds my hands
says he loves me 
tucks me in before sleep

I abuse, gaslight, and manipulate my autistic fembot gf and she is too low IQ to realize.

This is just an average relationship honestly

It is not. It is really weird. I both love and hate her and she is oblivious to how I abuse her and also probably has Stockholm syndrome since she comes from a broken home and was abused by her mom and her boyfriends from a young age.

I don't know how normalfags are able to keep up with obligations, I constantly feel like I'm going to break down. I had to get my blood drawn yesterday and just going to the hospital messed up all my plans for the day. I had to call someone on the phone today and I hung up when they redirected the line because it stressed me out. It's not fair. I thought it would get easier the more I did things but it doesn't. Every basic thing feels like a complicated obstacle to overcome. I'm drinking and it's nice though

Yeah I'm the same. Didn't even realize I had anxiety until a few years ago.
<comment>
Is it anxiety or autism? Whatcha drinking?
<comment>
It wont get better if you just do it with a fear for your life, you need to somehow overcome it while doing it also how did it mess up your plans, why not plan for them?
<comment>
What made you realize it?
These voodoo ranger juice force things, someone said they tasted like orange juice. They're pretty ok. Probably some combination.
I plan for it, but it takes up so much energy that I have to mentally recover the rest of the day. I try to accomplish other things anyway but it makes me feel retarded how difficult a 20 minute appointment is.

Do you mind if I drink with you? I have some vodka that I'll be taking to the dome.

because they get good pussy

Sure, it's comforting to know that other anons are being likeminded in some way. Hard alcohol makes me gag after I had a bad reaction to it once, do you drink it straight?
<comment>
I'm in the same boat as you entirely, but I've managed to just "deal with it". I do. I basically only drink straight alcohol. The cheapest of cheap shit too.

don't feel retarded because of it some people just get exhausted socially easily either just because how they are or anxiety or something else I used to have random things like this take up around 8 hours of my day because I would legit start going to the appointment 2 hours earlier than the actual arrival like a normal human then when I got home it took me hours to recover to do anything but I hope you will get better with this somehow

I almost bought a small bottle of whiskey to try mixing with something to build up a tolerance to it but I didn't want to risk it. It really does make me feel better that others get it.
I've figured out I need to start leaving earlier, I left with a good amount of time in advance but I still felt stressed from pushing it close from my incompetence finding the building and parking. I hope you're doing okay
<comment>
I would suggest not using whiskey. It is by far the shittiest tasting and it has, in my personal experience anyway, a high chance to make your drinking a bad time. Vodka is the best in my opinion. It just goes down quick and it's done. The throat burning stops after the first two or three swigs.
<comment>
How much do you have at once? I'm happy you're here in the thread with me. That raw alcohol smell is really intense to me but I dont mind the taste or burn. What makes you have vodka besides it being cheapest?
<comment>
same anon, i can do one thing every once in a while, then i want to recover for days or the rest of the week
<comment>
each person had different reasons. some are naturally more energetic just as some are naturally taller. others have loving families and friends to motivate them. others take drugs like methylphenidate. 
But i feel you, anon. Being like us is normal, it's the society that is too stressful and impatient and always in a rush. It's okay to take it slow.
<comment>
At once meaning one sitting or one drink? I'm glad to be here with you! Lol yeah, the paint thinner smell is rough, but almost all alcohol has it. Well when I started drinking, I would mix it and I felt like vodka mixed the best. When I realized I just wanted to get fucking drunk, I just stopped mixing it.
<comment>
Yeah exactly, I wish there were dedicated rest days to recover from everything.
One sitting, but I suppose over one night applies too. I dont get it from beer thats why I usually stick to it. I really like getting drunk too, it varies a lot depending on the day for how quickly it hits me though. hug,
<comment>
It really depends how long I go for. I have to be awake at 6:30 AM every morning so I tend to fall asleep early some nights. I would comfortably say I have about ten shots on an actual DEDICATED drinking night. Beer was just too much fluid for me. Too much pissing and too much puking purely from volume. Being drunk is very nice. One of my favorite feelings is that twilight between sober and tipsy. If I could live in that mode, I think I would.
<comment>
what time is it now for you? 10 seems like a lot, but I've never tried drinking exclusively hard alcohol. I feel like I behave more with beer because its an easy identifiable amount. are you feeling good right now?
<comment>
Just about 1 AM. It is, but I don't take real shots. I'll just dump some in a cup and drink or go straight from the bottle. Haha, I get that. I've probably had a lot more experience drinking than you so I know what I'm doing to myself. I am. I'm probably at like 8/10 in terms of good feelings.
<comment>
thats what time it is here too. are you gonna sleep soon then? that doesnt seem like very much sleep. I'm sure you have, I've only started in the last two years or so. I don't know how much Ive pushed it more than this but I think I feel about there too.
<comment>
Yeah the same happens to me. I can be months with a simple task like buying a new pair of sneakers or almost anything that I do. 
About being unable to talk on the telephone. Recently I had to call to get some information for my mother and I couldn't do it. Then some time after I could call to do another similar thing.
I'm unable to do simple things all the time and I take a lot of time to do basic things but there are times it gets worse and times it gets a little better. But yeah I general I struggle doing simple things.
<comment>
I really don't know. Some nights I just stay up until 6:30 and then go to sleep. I have to take give my cat insulin so it isn't like I have full obligations every day. Lol yeah, I have about a decade on you with some periods on and off. We shooting for 10/10?

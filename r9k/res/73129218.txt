I'm turning 23 soon and have still never had a gf. Not a virgin, but the lack of relationships sucks. It's my own fault for being severely socially retarded during high school and uni. Also I never go outside except to work.

What does it make you think about?
That's my age and I'm a virgin as well. I never even really talked to a girl.

I'm a 26 year old virgin. it will not get better, unless you get super lucky.

I'm a 25yo virgin, I can tell you wholeheartedly that the feeling you have now does not change. It does not get worse. It does not get better. This tepid feeling of emptiness will remain as it is right now.

I was a virgin until I was 23. Then I got married. Tradition > modernity.
<comment>
was she also a virgin? or are you just larping as traditional with only one half of the equation?

Forgot to add. I am a Christian who married a girl from church. Its funny though I was really social in high school and college, but as I get older I have become more anti-social. I dont trust people anymore, I just trust family now.

I was a 25 year old khhv and am now a 27 year old regular sex haver. It did not help as much as I imagined it would.
<comment>
Yes she was a virgin. We are both Christians. Been married 15 years. We met before all the social media dating shit started. Honestly, I would probably be incel if I was some Gen Z kid now.

Im still even though I have sex. I keep fantasizing about having a friend group of a bunch of guys who we all share the same interests and have each others backs. Like you see in the movies and television. I love my wife, but she cant fill that hole.

I was watching this with a friend when I was a teen and I commented "hah that's gonna be" and he gave me a reassuring "naa no way bro"
Only 8 more years to go!

posting the same threads over and over will surely help

Is it worth a watch? I never watched it on release because I was afraid watch a prediction of my future life.

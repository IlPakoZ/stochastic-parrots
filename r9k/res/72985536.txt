To Women,
I resent you. You know, I feel like i am really willing to make compromises because I think we can both benefit from it. Why does it always feel like you're way too fucking used to that and don't like it? It feels like you actively enjoy chaotic schisms because of the sheer fucking boredom of your bubbled up life. "Drama" is the mark of someone that hasn't ever suffered from a stupid mistake no matter how hard they've tried. There's just something pointlessly awful about how you behave. I'm not sure i can articulate it clearly enough yet.

Perhaps I was blind
I tried to be a good man
Somewhere I was wrong

Indeed, there is a lot of truth in what you say OP.

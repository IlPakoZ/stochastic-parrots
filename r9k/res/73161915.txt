ive seen it only straightens it not sharp it on jewtube

On a micro level it does sharpen. It's just not as efficient as stones.It gets the job done and it's harder to fuck it up.

<comment>
I'd say chuck that stone into somebody's kitchen window and hope they have a sharper knife.

I think you're gonna need a whet stone if you want a nice point.

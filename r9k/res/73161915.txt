how do i sharpen a kitchen knife with things everyone has at home?
wet rock
hey fucker I gave you legitimate advice and you can look it up on jewtube
yeah fucker im yet to test it 
my question is would it work smoothly on meat you fag
I have a honing rod. Sucks if u don't man.
ive seen it only straightens it not sharp it on jewtube
On a micro level it does sharpen. It's just not as efficient as stones.It gets the job done and it's harder to fuck it up.
checked
lets say i got a stone. for how long should i sharpen it?
I'd say chuck that stone into somebody's kitchen window and hope they have a sharper knife.
thats exactly what ill do
cheers

I don't really know the difference but I think it would be fine.

I think you're gonna need a whet stone if you want a nice point.

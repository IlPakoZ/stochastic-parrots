Ive also looked at evil stuff. I hope you feel better anon. Try to make virtuous choices in the future. It's never too late to change. Also off topic but picrel looks really painful.

The cool thing about this sort of thing is that you dont have to subject yourself to it again. You can read synopsis' and get a general idea of what goes on in one before reading it.
I don't subject myself to things that make me take spiritual damage anymore and neither should you.

He told me that he stopped touching himself after we started talking, because it felt "weird" to do so. What did he mean by that?
Means he's trapped in Jewish law maybe. The Jews got em. Masturbation is perfectly fine.
he stopped touching himself because I'm in his room making him my bitch, sorry sis.
simple. He is trying to say he wants to have sex with you, and it is his cringey way of expressing that. He is letting you know his sexual desire is building and building, and he is waiting for you to make the first move. If you do, make sure you are direct about it. If both people in a relationship are indirect, it is doomed to cause fights due to constant disappointment.
hes being cringy. hes saying he doesnt jerk off and only for you when you erp or nudes or whatever. or maybe he actually likes you idk. im sure a lot of guys catch feelings online
